5,TL;DR - I've been waiting for a new wireless version of the Naga for some time now. As a multi-genre gamer that mainly plays MMOs but occasionally dabbles in other genres like shooters the Trinity concept is perfect. The Naga Pro feels like slightly upgraded and wireless available version of an already great mouse. If you're a fan of the original Naga Trinity or looking for a great all-around wireless gaming mouse with a large number of buttons the Naga Pro comes as a strong recommendation.Longer version: I've always liked the general feel of the Naga mouse - not too big not too small relatively ergonomic to my average if not slightly smaller hand size for a guy. I've been using the mouse and its different versions since the OG back in 2009 and my favorite version was the 2014 Epic Chroma that also had a wireless option. Since then Naga mice haven't supported wireless. That's unfortunate as I like the clean desk look of a wireless mouse and get annoyed by the "tug" of the cable despite trying some gadgets that try to wrangle cables in the ideal positions. The downside for wireless purportedly is the delay versus wired mouse. Honestly I cannot tell the difference. It feels instantaneous to me. Wired vs Wireless is only something that matters to professional gamers when every tiny detail gives an edge over the competition. But for 99% of gamers out there your skill is going to define your performance/ranking far more than something like a minuscule amount of delay on your mouse. Suffice to say it's not going to turn your game around enough to choose wired over wireless if you generally prefer wireless. Razer touts its "Hyperspeed" wireless - I don't know how much of that is just marketing nonsense. To my feeling the responsiveness at least compares to my Logitech G305 which I use for my setup in my living room with my nVIDIA Shield.Now I'll ramble a bit about Naga as a product line. I've gone through like 6 different Naga mouse over the years - none of them broke; they've all performed great. I only upgraded them because of wanting features or because they  were getting too grimy after many hours of use (which as an MMO gamer they have gotten many hundreds of hours of mileage). Firstly if you're generally in the market for a MMO mouse and looking at the different options out there I think the Naga has always been the best. I've tried some of the others out there from Corsair and Logitech. They're decent products but ultimately the thing that has me coming back is the physical ergonomics of the Naga. I love the shape of the mouse and the 12 buttons are easy to differentiate from each other by the individual button contours. It doesn't even need "bumps" to help you train your muscle memory (which would eventually erode over time trust me). The only downside is that I feel like the last three buttons (10 11 and 12) are difficult to hit without hand strain but this may be because of my smaller sized hand and getting older.That being said 1 through 9 is still some great button real estate. As far as playing MMOs I consider the Naga (or a similar mouse) essential. I honestly don't know how I used to play without them. You can use them as additional button binds or you can replicate your number keys to give your hands some different options to hit the same keys (which I do to overcome hand strain from long hours of play). If you've never tried a mouse like this and aren't sure if it's worth it  - it is. The only challenge is the initial learning curve. It took me several weeks to really get used to using the mouse but once I did there was no going back. It helps so much in raiding for example when you might need to be running around with WASD while also hitting a complex button rotation. Doing this is night and day between having a Naga and not having a Naga.Now I'll zero in on the Naga Pro. This only just came out so I can't review it for things like battery longevity. That being said Razer's not new to the PC product game so I have nor reason to doubt in its technical specifications for the charge time. Out of the box the mouse does feel very similar to the Trinity if not exactly the same. The shape is the same the side button contours are the same and the materials seem the same. The materials I think are perhaps the only slight downfall of the product - it has a bit of a plasticy feel to it; I wish the product felt more solid. That being said the light weight does help in situations like FPS gaming when you need to move the mouse quickly. For a chunkier sized mouse it's not a bad weight. But if you solely game FPS the Naga would be hard to recommend. There are lighter mice out there and you might want to consider something wired. That being said if you are just a casual FPS gamer or playing something like Borderlands the Naga works just fine if not outstanding with the additional button potential. The hot-swappable left panel is one of the coolest innovations in gaming mice tech I've seen in years. It works instantly and without a hitch. It snaps in place magnetically - it feels solid and never like it's a weird attachment.Speaking about the additional buttons that's another thing that's changed over the Trinity. The hot-swappable left panel has gotten rid of one panel in exchange for another. Instead of the "circular" button layout designed for MOBAs (which tbh I never used even as someone who occasionally plays MOBAs) there is a more condensed 1-6 button layout. It's kind of a nice option for people who play MMOs with fewer keybinds like Guild Wars 2 or someone who can't reach all 12 buttons. I see this as an improvement over the Trinity as I never used the circular button layout and could potentially use the 1-6 grid layout.Long story short (too late) so far I think the Naga Pro is great. It maintains the greatness of the Trinity product and brings in to a wireless version. If you liked the Trinity you will like the Naga Pro. If you did not like the Trinity you will not like the Naga Pro. If you're new in the market for a MMO mouse I recommend trying it out. Be gentle with it though and leave yourself the option to return if you don't like it. Some people complain about the scroll wheel but I've never had an issue there. Suffice to say mice are personal and subjective peripherals and things like shape and ergonomics differ in preference from person to person. This might not be the mouse for you. But as a concept it's executed well and one of the best on market. The final downside is the price - it's on the expensive side. But for me input is how you interact with your game - it's the connection between you and what's happening in-game. It's worth investing in as a core part of your setup.
5,This was a nice upgrade from my old wireless Razer Naga Epic Chroma. The battery on the Epic started to drain so quickly. Sometimes it wouldn’t hold its charge or even charge at all constantly flashing it’s red light making it impossible to use for extended periods. But I was so used to the MMO buttons and middle click that also tilts left and right so it was difficult trying to find a new one with those features. At least until this one came out.Major selling points:- can be wireless or wired.- has MMO buttons.- middle click tilts left and right / can go back and forth on pages.- fits my smaller hand comfortably.- nice texture.- conveniently adjustable DPI.…that’s literally it. No other mouse has all of these things that I now require for a mouse.I honestly don’t care about the other interchangeable button panels at the moment or the led colors I just turned it on a low green to match my old Deathstalker keyboard.The only downsides that I have encountered with this so far:- it doesn’t feel as well-made as my Epic does. It’s lighter and has a sort of cheap feeling about it. The middle scroll is clickier while the Epic was smoother. Epic was clearly made out of better materials. Pro looks cheaper in general but the texture is nice.- I can’t use the same application for both peripherals as I could before since both were like 10 years old and used the outdated software. It’s an extra app taking up space on my SSD but I’m also looking to upgrade my keyboard anyway so we’ll see what happens.Highly recommend this Naga Pro especially if you’re using an old Naga Epic that’s started to become unusable. However I haven’t tried any versions in between simply because they didn’t have the above list. It just depends on personal preference. Try one that’s on display at a store before buying if possible.
5,I'll start by saying that this review pains me to make because I *loved* this mouse while it worked properly but here we are...Here's the good — it feels great. I used this paired with a Firefly v2 hard mat and it glides perfectly smooth across it. It has a great weight to it but some may not like it as much depending on the mat you use and the ergonomics are simple yet very nice. The interchangeable side panels' buttons are well-placed and are not too clicky or too stiff and switching the plates is a breeze while also registering the new plate settings instantly.And the bad — As cool as the plates are they don't work as intended for much time. I think I had this for a few months before the plates would quit registering inputs sometimes. On the number pad for instance numbers 1356 and 7 might work but 24890 etc. might fail. It was a simple fix though only requiring you tale the plate completely off and putting it back on. It didn't stop there though and about a year or so after buying it the plates completely stopped working. I tried reinstalling the software but ironically Razer does not list the firmware for this mouse on their site. They list the Naga Pro but not the Trinity.Unfortunately it's not just me having this issue. All over the internet there are forums and comments about this exact issue and Razer has seemingly yet to address it. I'm not about to spend $100 to find out either so oh well.I've decided to retire it for now and maybe see if it works with my laptop but I'm left very sad about it. My new Corsair Scimitar Elite is pretty cool though so hopefully I'll get over it soon.Final words to sum things up — GREAT idea but the horrible horrible quality control keeps that idea from a reasonable execution unless you like buying a new mouse once or twice a year...
5,I have only had this mouse for a few days so I can't speak to longevity but I wanted to note the differences between the X and the Trinity because I naively assumed the X was the same but with only the MMO/12-button sideplate (which is the only one I wanted/will use).  However there are a couple of other differences.  One is that there's only one button in the middle top of the mouse on the X and two on the Trinity (these are normally DPI buttons by default but I always re-bind them).  Another is that the scroll wheel on the X can only be pressed down (you can achieve this by pushing it to the right as well but it's the same button) and the Trinity has separate buttons for pushing it to the left and right (I also am used to binding both of these).  The third difference I noticed was in the shape of the mouse itself: the Trinity seems slightly heavier and the buttons are slightly more pronounced.I bought these mice to replace my old MMO mouse the Logitech G600 which I have used for four years and have never had any issues with.  However the G600 is a reasonably big mouse and as I moved more and more of my core buttons onto the mouse from my keyboard it became more and more awkward to press them easily with my small hands.  The Nagas are smaller and more comfortable for that and I like the weight better.  As of right now I am liking the Trinity enough better than the G600 that even if it starts double clicking in 6 months and I have to replace it I will continue to use the Trinity.  One concern I do have however is that the buttons in general are less pronounced than on the G600.  The buttons on that mouse are incredibly easy to distinguish because they have very distinct angles/shapes and at least one has a little ridge.  The angles on the Nagas are subtler and none of the buttons have a ridge which means I find myself clicking the wrong button more than I used to but I am hopeful that I will get used to the mouse and no longer have this problem.One concern of mine with the Naga I had many years ago is that if you wanted to use any sort of custom binds you had to run Synapse the whole time.  This does not appear to be the case for the Trinity.
5,I have three Razor mice and I use them all with my home and work PCs. The Naga is my favorite because of its shape. I have rather large hands and long fingers and the way this mouse sits in my palm is pretty much perfect. Very ergonomic and solid grip. Sure DeathAdder as well as Mamba are also very comfortable but there's something special about having this heavy & big mouse with the arching bulge under my palm. I feel very much in control of its movement and actually appreciate its weight. It's precise and customizable enough for my needs. The three RGB zones may be lacking to some but really it all comes down to how comfortable a mouse feels and not how it looks.I like its clicky somewhat stiffer buttons. The main buttons take a bit of effort to actuate than the buttons on DeathAdder or Mamba but I like that feeling. There are less accidental miss-clicks. Perhaps a professional CS:GO player would appreciate the light weight and sensitivity of DeathAdder but I just a casual gamer that plays a lot of story-driven FPS and RPGs really dig the Naga. Sure the sensor it has can't be as fine-tuned with the software as the one in the DeathAdder but this aspect has 0 difference to me personally.  And don't get me wrong the sensor it has is very good probably the same hardware in fact that goes up to 16000 DPI -- it just can't be as minutely adjusted by software as on some of other Razer mice. I use stock presets. Low sensitivity for FPS higher sensitivity for RTS etc. The stock sensitivity options are plenty sufficient to me but can be modified to some extent by the Synapse.I am sure a lot of people would seek this mouse not for its shape but for the fact that it has three panels for the left side with various button layouts. I do find that having the extra buttons is nice and I've been learning to utilize them more. It feels awesome having all 12 of my most used spells in WoW being accessible by the thumb. It does take a bit of practice to get good with those buttons but it's really worth it especially when it comes to PVP. The fact that you don't have to use the panel with 12 buttons if you don't want to and could have a panel with 7 or 3 -- is very nifty. Certain titles might work better with the lesser number of buttons and switching them on the go is effortless. It really is like having three mice in one. Others noted that the replaceable panels feel very solid and I will note that too. There's no give or any kind of rattling. They sit in secured by magnets the way that you can't even tell that they are replaceable. I think that's certainly a big win for the design.I can't comment on the reliability or how long this mouse would last. I see a lot of negative comments from people that complain of the buttons' failure. I haven't experienced any of this yet though I haven't used this mouse for a long time. My other two Razer mice -- the DeathAdder Elite and the Mamba Elite -- have no issues. The DeathAdder is nearly 5 years old since I purchased it. It sill runs strong and there's only mild wear for the most part it still looks like new. Sure Naga is a very different model than the other two and it may behave differently but so far Razer got a very good nearly excellent track-record with me. Otherwise I wouldn't purchase this mouse in the first place.The three RGB zones may put some people away but to me it doesn't matter. I don't stare at my mouse when I play and the comfort of use is way more important than the pretty lights. The Mamba Elite has some very extensive RGB to it and I have it plugged in for the pretty effects (starlight looks awesome on its sides!) and it's more of a display piece now on my desk than my daily driver. The Naga on the other hand has become the daily driver that I very much enjoy using. I wish I bought it as my first Razer mouse so that by now I would have been a pro with the extra buttons!
4,I have been a big fan of the Naga series of mouse for a long time. This one has the optical click that fixes some of the common misclick problems the mechanical ones have. All in all this is a great addition to the series but it loses a point for not having weights as it is quite light compared to other Nagas for dropping one of the buttons behind the scroll wheel and for dropping the left and right tilt clicks from the scroll wheel.
4,I have now had 3 razer Nagas in my time of pc gaming. The first one lasted about 4 years the second one about 4 as well (Would have been longer but its death was my fault) and now this one which is way better than the last two mostly because I can use it in many more scenarios with the wireless capabilities. The design is basically the same as the past other than the 2.4 USB actually hides nicely in the slot for changeable side panels which is really well done on Razers part. The two buttons by the mouse wheel are now smaller which is not to my liking I enjoyed the longer buttons since I use them for my media controls one to play/pause and one to skip songs this is really good for quick ingame multimedia controls since I use the left and right mouse wheel for volume up and down. A huge plus is the removable USB cord since it has wireless. This may seem like a given but my first Naga actually died due to the cord giving out on me.Pros:Interchangeable side panelsFantastic controls in mmo's/any game reallyBest macro controls I’ve encountered.Great response timesCons:The software does funny things to some games.The 12 key side panel can be just a little awkward if you have large hands.Does not let me time travel.Razer Naga vs Corsair Scimitar Pro - I am including this for the ones reading reviews to base their decision on the two best mmo mouses out there imo.I tried the Scimitar for the last year before now resorting back to the Naga but neither of them are without flaws though they both include some pros that the other may not have as well.ScimitarLet’s start with the Scimitar the mouse was of good quality when I first got it. It had a nice adjustable slider that would allow you to move the keypad on the side forwards and backwards so that you could adjust to your thumbs reach which was nice. The feel was really nice and had a good weight to it It lacked one feature I loved about the Naga though The side to side action you could do with the mouse wheel for programmable key actions. The Corsair is counterintuitive. the key mapping is very awkward to learn and you wouldn't know you had to save the profiles (I know that sounds weird but you would understand if you saw the software) but the worst part is how large the program is 1gb+ which is insane for me just having the mouse nothing else corsair. I would also see it using 5% of my processor at times. But the true failure which seems to be common enough for people to sell 3d printed fixes for it is that most Scimitar’s last about six months to a year before the mouse wheel stops working correctly. Trying to scroll down will randomly start scrolling up then back down again and the same with scrolling up. That is why I came back to the Naga.NagaThe Naga has only one fault in my opinion. It is also the software but its very easy to learn and use its GUI is pretty much perfect honestly. The issue is with some games (mostly DirectX9 games) if your polling rate is at 1000mhz then you will see significant drops in your FPS. This does not affect every DirectX9 game but it does affect one of my favorite games Guild Wars 2. In world bosses is when you will notice the largest fps drops. I can be getting 23 fps in the middle of a world boss with a full map queue on the boss itself but when I move the mouse my fps drops to around 3. The same goes for WvW. There are also reports of the Chroma sync option in games will make them pretty much unplayable if enabled but that’s not huge since its just RGB. That’s the only thing I truly dislike about the Naga everything else is perfect.
4,Overall the mouse performs as expected. I find myself pressing the buttons on the side of the mouse accidentally when moving the mouse. This becomes distracting. I use a Mac as my daily driver and a PC for gaming. The mouse is supposed to store its profile when set on the PC if it moves to another computer; however I have found this to be hit or miss. The trouble is when it resets by default is for the numerical buttons to map to number keys. When it happens when using the mouse on MacOS and I press a side button by accident this can cause undesirable results. This is compounded by Razer's refusal to support MacOS in Synapse 3. I have been using exclusively Razer peripherals for several generations - and I'm disappointed enough in the Naga 3 that I have decided to migrate to a similarly priced Logi g502.
5,A little background as a purchaser/reviewer of products:Having owned a RΛZΞR mouse since the original Naga was introduced until it got worn out from usage and then I had to get a Hex v2 to replace it because you couldn't buy the old naga anymore. Now I got the Naga Trinity. A quick wiki search tells me there have been nine iterations in the Naga series not counting the redesigned versions and I must say I have never not liked one of my MMO/MOBA mice from RΛZΞR. And I'm not one of them gamer lifestyle junkies or uber Razer fanboys that goes out and buys everything chroma and wears their clothing or nothing. In fact I actually own plenty of varying brands across my gaming peripherals including Corsair Logitech etc. I just like Razers products when it comes to their M+K options. Mice specifically being reviwed here because they are quality and I trust them as one of the premier gaming hardware manufacturing companies. There are many of these brands out there for PC to choose from these days but Razer is right at the top IMHO..The mouse:After years of using the original Naga then Hex v2 and now Naga Trinity I got use to  this style of mouse configuration and how the ergonomics or placement of your hand sits on them. It rests a little differently so you might feel awkward at first but trust me you will get use to it with repitition in no time.I liked to keep my muscle memory the same so when my original Naga wore out I looked for another. I ended up going with Hex v2 because the Naga had been phased out with the emergence of popular MOBA's they redesigned it a little bit. I was reluctant to buy that one because i wanted my 12 buttons in 3x4 pattern not the circular 7 buttons. But I got use to it and it sufficed until the Trinity was released.Once the Trinity came out it gives you the best of all worlds really. You can swap out the side button options to what you prefer or need for any specific game you want to play. Or any program you wanna use your mouse with (non-gaming).Which brings me to my next point in Razer mice. They have top notch lasers in them very accurate. While the implications for gaming are obvious here just as a everyday mouse for anyone using a PC they are worthy of a purchase. They last a long time. Tons of clicks and scrolls on the scroll wheel before they wear down and need to be replaced. Talking years of usage. And I'm a heavy PC user. Not just for games either. Once you use it awhile the tactile feel of the mouse scroll does go away but everything functions fine still. I actually prefer getting them worn in tbh.Lastly I'm one of the people who actually has no gripes about their hardware configuration tool Synapse. It works flawlessly for me and wasn't that hard to learn either. The tool offers a lot of customization for what each button on the mouse does what even letting you keybind a custom function like Shift+Q to a single button press if you wanna get complex. Also want to point out that on the bottom of this mouse there is a button that quickly swaps profiles so you can set up a profile for each game you are playing. or some MMO games you play different class/job so you can have a different profile and have the buttons do something else on each. Customizing and keybinding to your hearts desire really. Then of course the Synapse has the DPI options and the superfluous stuff like lighting options which is nice and I get why they include it but not wholly needed.All in all you won't be disappointed by this mouse. No matter if you play MMO's/MOBA's/Shooters/or don't game at all. I almost bought two just because i know when it wears out years down the road I'm just going to want to replace it with another one.
4,This mouse is one of the more expensive gaming mice available. You buy something like this (as opposed to just a regular old mouse) when you want some extra buttons on your mouse compared to a more basic one and want to have more control over exactly what your mouse does. Although this mouse is plug-n-play you can (and should) download the software that pairs with it so you can customize it to your needs. This includes changing what the buttons do changing the lighting (or removing it entirely if you prefer) and changing the sensitivity.Recently I tried two top gaming mice the Corsair Nightsword and this Razer Naga Trinity. I first got the Naga Trinity and would have stayed with it but I had some double-clicking issues when it first arrived. Sometimes when I tried to click things or select text it would do an extra click or not click at all which was quite frustrating. I had no choice but to either replace it or try a different mouse and I opted for the latter.Before I continue do note that I have pretty large hands (8.25" from middle finger tip to the crease on my wrist 4" across the widest part of my palm (across the knuckles) and nearly 10" from my thumb tip to my pinky tip when my hands are open wide as if I were trying to palm a basketball) and I use a fintertip style grip (see pictures) on my mouse — your own hand size and grip style will determine whether each of these mice is a good fit for you.Here is what I like and dislike about each with points from -3 to +3 next to each point which indicate how much I like or dislike each feature (-3 being very much dislike +3 being very much like):Corsair Nightsword:A. [+3] it has two additional buttons to click on top (gives more top button options for gaming the Razer only has extra side buttons)B. [+1] it has more protection for the thumb (although my thumb doesn't really drag on the mousepad without it it's a nice touch)C. [+1] DPI level can be seen from the side of the mouse (rather than the normal which I feel like is by the center top of the mouse which you can't see when your hand is there) a the mouse changes color when you press it to make the change even more salientD. [+0.5] Aesthetically looks better than the Razer Naga in my opinionE. [-1] Middle mouse wheel requires a bit more force than I would like to click itF. [-3] (Dealbreaker for me) I can only reach 1 of the 3 side thumb buttons with my normal grip despite the fact that I have large hands. I would need to convert to palm grip which is not really desirable as it's less precise with clicking.Razer Naga Trinity:A. [+3] Changeable side panels allow you to use the button setup you prefer although I feel like the 12 button grid is a bit excessive and wish there was an option for a 6-button grid.B. [+3] The mouse wheel can be tilted left or right which is handy they can be configured as extra buttonsC. [-3] The double-clicking / misclicking issue I described above. Strangely it seems to occur much less now for no reason I can explain but if it happens even one more time I'm going to have to replace the mouse. Note: My particular mouse might simply be defective but other reviewers have said this is an issue for them as well so clearly there's some sort of quality control issue.For me the 12-button side panel is great because the way I naturally use the mouse my thumb rests right in the center of all the buttons making them all accessible if need-be (though pressing the middle buttons is a bit trickier at least I can reach all of them whereas my partner with smaller hands cannot easily press all the buttons even if she wanted to).I'll probably stick with the Razer Naga trinity (and re-order a new one if the clicking issues persist) simply because the side buttons are difficult to reach for me with the Corsair Nightsword but I hope I provided enough detail so you can make a more-informed decision for yourself. :)
4,So I needed to get a mouse with more side buttons as I play alot of MMO games and this mouse was well worth the purchase it is alot of side buttons but you could always find the other one with I believe 7 side buttons which leaves room for your thumb to grip... which is my only con to the mouse there really isn't a part on the side to grip but I found a work around... this mouse also works with other games as well.
5,I purchased this mouse because my old Razer mouse crapped out on me after 6 good years of use. I really didn’t want to have to buy a new mouse because I was unsure I could ever find it again. And it turns it isn’t manufactured anymore. HOWEVER! This mouse does it for me completely. And then some. I had the model that ONLY had the circular button selection. But this model allows you to switch between three. And although I don’t use two of the options they’re there if I ever did decide to. And I love knowing that. The only thing that some people may find an issue even though I don’t is that it is on the heavier side. There are a lot of people who prefer lighter mice for shooters and what not but this works perfect for me. Would buy again definitely.
5,I have a big hand relatively speaking and I don't like the slender feel of some mice where it feels like you are gripping it with just your fingers. This mouse fits in your entire palm and that makes it precise with the way you move your hand. No wobbling around or awkward grips everything in the right place in my opinion. I swear the cheap mouses they literally design to be uncomfortable so you spend money buying that then realize that it stinks and then upgrade and they got you twice.. don't cheap out get this and thank me later.
5,It lasts much longer than advertised. I use my computer 13 hours a day due to work or entertainment and this mouse is exactly what was advertised. I've never had the 2.4 wireless disconnect yet after a few months of use. If you have the money like razer and want a wireless mouse get this.
3,I loved the concept of this mouse.  I specifically bought it for the 7 button circle which is absolutely fantastic.  The 12 button side was also great but more than I needed.  I need a mouse with approx 6 buttons on the side for gaming.This mouse soon became a nightmare.  The design of the mouse is very wide and requires you to place your right ring finger on the top of the mouse (what?).  This is the first and only mouse I've ever used that did this.  At first I thought it was a great idea as it would allow me to "flick" easier.  After about 3 days of use my wrist started to hurt.  I didn't think much of it until I had a 4 day break from gaming and my wrist healed.  After about 12 hours of use over multiple days my wrist starting having issues again.  I needed to see a chiropractor and have my wrists adjusted which is not a pleasant experience for those who know.Sensor is 10/10.  Button feel is 10/10.  Software companion app was ... well yet another app to run but did allow to me really customize the 7 button wheel.  However I cannot use the mouse ... it's simply not healthy.For comparison I have owned SteelSeries Sensei (desktop) and Lenovo Legion M600 (for laptop) for multiple years and they still work great.  They only have 2 buttons on the left side but at least they don't make me feel like I have the wrists of a 75 year old.Please please please try this out in a store in person before buying.  I am a human and my wrist is like yours.  Take me seriously when I say this is a safety and ergonomic concern.-Final
4,The mouse is pretty good overall but the side plates except the two-button one are useless
5,ERGO: 3/5Usability: 4/5I have been using Nagas for quite someTime now and I will say they are great for the intended use for MMO’s. The standard Naga (this product) is very limited to this use case. Playing anything other than MMO’s is slightly problematic at times when initiating flicks for shooters due to the button pad. Dunno why this has a battery life star thing because this mouse is wired. If you primarily play MMO’s great mouse if you are very diverse in what you play get the Naga Trinity. That one has three swappable plates to change the button pad for a forward/back a 6 button hex and the standard 12 button for that flexibility.
5,Got this to replace a Logitech one that was messing up.  This is so much better lighter and has a nice braided cord.
5,Big gamer and this mouse has so many different options for different games. I love how customizable it is from keys to dpi settings. I've had a red dragon mouse for so long I was very timid about switching to a new brand but I love my Razer keyboard so this was a perfect fit.It's not extremely heavy but definitely not a light mouse so if you prefer a very light mouse I would not recommend this.
4,NEGATIVES: My one bigger gripe is none of the swappable button side plates really grabbed me and I think they all could be improved. For example I think they've got a really good idea with the 6 button side panel but it's just not good enough. The buttons taper into thin lines so there's not much button face area to actually press. I recognize why they did this (so there are vertical/horizontal gaps between buttons for the user to feel which buttons are which) but I found this tapering to be much more extreme than was necessary. A more gradual/less severe tapering would've left larger pressable button faces while still having vertical/horizontal gaps between each button.The other thing they absolutely should've done is texture all the button faces to be "grippy" rather than smooth/flat -- for example the recent DeathAdder V2 has a sort of grippy finish to its button plastic and I think this would've helped a lot with the buttons on the Naga Pro. If I compare the two-big button layout on the DeathAdder V2 to the two-big button layout on the Naga Pro side plate the side plate just can't compete in terms of quality. The DAV2 buttons depress further and have a more satisfying "click" to them/also have a better grippy texture finish. The 12 button layout isn't for me personally as I want a dedicated place to rest my thumb (and I lean more towards having fewer but bigger/more comfortable buttons) but that one interestingly is the only one to sport RGB just something I thought I'd note.POSITIVES: After using this mouse I'm stunned that more mice don't have a ring finger/pinky support protrusion like this one does. I wish that my DeathAdder V2 had a ring finger support protrusion + pinky grip like this! The wireless performance and battery life are great and many of the experimental features work far better than I expect. For example I was very apprehensive regarding the swappable button plates but they lock into place firmly and really do feel like they're just part of the mouse. The scroll wheel has a left/right click feature which I was also worried wouldn't work well but it actually does and I don't misclick them when trying to middle click or anything like that works really well for me.Before this I tried the m65 elite the ironclaw and various deathadders and the big ergonomic boon this has that other mice don't is the ring finger protrusion support I have mammoth hands and this mouse ends up being very comfortable for me to hold. I do prefer higher arch of the DeathAdder V2 (the DeathAdder V2 is also a longer mouse which I prefer) but that ring finger support/pinky grip are game changers.I'll have to see how the build quality holds up over time but initially I am very impressed. Even the 6 button side plate which I worried about ended up being comfortable enough for my large hands where my thumb ends up in between 4 buttons and I can move it back for the last two (where moving my thumb backwards is a lot more comfortable than moving it forwards). There's clear room for further improvement for that 6-button layout though (see above). Mouse feet are also great which is a plus.
5,Light solid works as advertised great for gaming and casual browsing. Very nice clicky buttons with the attachements and whatnot can't go wrong with Razer!
5,Comfortable and easy to use. Haven't had any issues.
5,I use this mouse for shortcuts in various programs. It's one thing to have a couple extra buttons for navigation or general purpose in Windows or Chrome but having a few extra buttons to cut copy paste and undo are helpful. Where this thing really shines is when you've got those obnoxious "quick keys" where you really need two hands on the keyboard or where you could frequently use a regular series of shortcuts. This mouse is spectacular in Adobe Illustrator InDesign Outlook Adobe Premiere. The Razer Synapse software detects the program you're using and switches your mouse to the appropriate button profile so you don't have to put much thought into it. It can also change the color patterns in case you find it useful to use the color to identify the current profile. The two buttons below the wheel are preset to change the dpi—you would think that a higher dpi would mean a more detailed scan and slower movement but whatever. The up button makes it go faster the down button slower. You can set these speeds and their intervals manually per program. I find I need slower movement in Illustrator but it's nice to move faster when I'm working with type.  I have a few gripes though:1. The Synapse software takes a few seconds to recognize a program change which can be annoying in flow state.2. Setting up the profiles is a real pain. The software automatically detects games and might even have presets but non-game applications must be located manually. Adobe and Microsoft don't exactly make finding their executables easy.3. While I can't imagine a much better system it takes a long time to set up button and color profiles (which are two separate programs in the Synapse system for some reason). Recording macros setting appropriate shortcuts and navigating the synapse software itself all involve an annoying learning curve on a counterintuitive interface. Razer could have saved me a lot of trouble by making preset productivity-based profiles.4. The finished surface of this mouse is great at first but it's made of PBT plastic—which gets polished and shiny after enough use especially under the fingertips. I get the feeling Razer knows this and doesn't mind. When you feel like you've got an old mouse you're gonna want a new one—but honestly if an upgraded version used PBT or some other more durable surface I'd buy it.5. The 2-key and 7-key panels are easy to use but the 12-key panel lacks distinction between keys and there are no "home" bumps or other indicators apart from a slight stagger among the keys so it's easy to get disoriented. If you're using it frequently the keypad also defines your grip which your wrist may feel from time to time.6. Personally I find the mouse body to be a bit too narrow. This is another gripe about the grip. For a hand the size of mine (I'm 6'2" with big hands for my height... I can't think of a better measurement) and my pinky finger has to curl all the way in to grip the mouse enough to lift it (which I don't frequently do).All told I feel like this is still the best mouse option I personally have avaliable in the sub $100 range.
4,Mine was defective and failed about 9 months after I got it. The customer service is set up in a way that is a pain to deal with. They did get me an RMA replacement (about two weeks) so I guess it's okay for now. If I don't update this again from here then the mouse is working and I am happy with it. It's also pretty heavy if that matters to you.
5,Man I love this mouse! I have big hands and I feel comfortable holding and pressing the side buttons. For mmo’s it works perfectly with the 12 buttons easy to program.
5,Calidad  de producto
4,I've had this mouse for a few days now and not sure how I should review it; but here are the pros and cons so far.  I'll revise this review if anything changes as I get used to the device.Pros:* The construction of the mouse is great; solid feel good materials* The three removable side button panels are super cool (they light up too!)* The Razer Synapse program coordinates a color scheme across my Razer Blackwidow Chroma and this mouse which looks awesome.  Now I just need to update my Razer Nostromo Gaming keypad to one of the Orbweaver Tartarus V2 or Tartarus Pro each of which has a desperately needed fourth row of programmable keys over the Nostromo.  The Orbweaver has a key (#20) in the lower right as opposed to a scroll wheel in the Tartarus models; so I will probably opt for the Orbweaver (it's also $5-$10 bucks cheaper than the Tartarus models) as I don't need another scroll wheel* At ~$75 its a good value for a mid-range gaming mouseCons:* I have difficulty with the scroll wheel moving web pages up and down.  It seems to skip some input and moves too slowly but this may be a device setting I still need to tweak* Looks like you can order combinations of Razer products here on Amazon but it doesn't look like you'd save any money doing so so not sure I'd count that as a plus* I was able to find a number of hardware products that support Razer's Chroma program like cases fans even memory sticks but no mice or keyboards...* The Chroma devices seem to have a problem with USB hubs; you can easily search for this on the internet.  The basics of both the keyboard and mouse function when plugged into a (KVM) hub (keys and clicks work) but the Chroma functionality doesn't work.  This is a major negative for me as I switch between machines (gaming laptop raspberry pi) often.  If I plug the keyboard directly into the computer the mouse will work properly if it's plugged into the USB port on the Blackadder keyboard though* The ergonomics:  - My middle finger rather than resting on the right mouse switch ends up gripping the right side of the mouse and it "feels funny" to keep it up on the mouse key and have my ring finger do the gripping  - The replaceable side panels with different button configurations make it difficult to grip the mouse without accidentally pressing on one of the side buttons.  There are three replaceable left side button pads: the one with two keys is easiest for me to use the one with six buttons with a center rubber pad is usable but feels very awkward trying to keep my thumb on the pad to keep a good grip on the mouse; and the one with 12 buttons is almost unusable without accidentally clicking one of the buttons.  - I keep accidentally pressing one of the DPI keys just behind the scroll wheel so the game action seems to go haywire until I readjust it.I am hoping these issues will go away or at least become workable with practice programming and patience.  The learning curve is not insignificant.  I'll post an addendum to this review after a couple of months so you can see how the adjustment went - for me anyways.  But I'd bet a hardcore gamer could get used to it very quickly; if you like the bling I recommend it 100%.
3,First off let me get the positives out of the way: the mouse itself is great adjustable dpi programmable buttons multiple faceplates and decent battery life.The problem that I feel worth taking 2 stars off for is the terrible micro USB plug they used. Not only did they cheap out and not use USB C which was the standard when this was released (saving a few pennies for them on your hundred dollar purchase) but they used a micro USB that was custom made for this mouse and which a standard micro USB will not fir into due to the smaller size of the entry leading up to the plug and the grooves contained on it.This means you need to keep careful track of the special cable they sent you or it will not be able to be charged.This also means you can't have a nice one-cable-fits-all USB C or even a USB C with micro USB adapter tip. Even if you could find the reverse and instead buy a micro USB to USB C adapter (which are far less common and harder to find) you would be stuck with the slower transfer/charge speeds for other items as micro USB maxes out at a 1/20 of the speed and a 1/10 of the power.TLDR: the company shafted the userbase to save pennies on a $100+ mouse.
5,(Update) 8-22-2022Perfect Bought a Second As Backup - 1 problem it's small but still annoying when rebooting computer make sure to have internet connection as software when restarting will connect to razer before allowed to use programable keys.Thank You Razor. This Is the perfect mouse for my to go office bag. I am a mobile printshop owner. I constantly sit with customers and design the idea in their head before I used a xbox controller with controller companion. Do not get me wrong it worked but this mouse changes the game.  It works for what I need All The shortcuts for photoshop at my right thumb. In the future I Will be buying a backup soon to keep in the bag in case the first one dies.Only Have 1 Type A on my HP Spectra and I need that for the epson v39 scanner I carry with me.
3,I bought 2 one from amazon and one from a local store.Used one of them from around January 2021 until recently when the scroll wheel click started to double click and sometimes not even register. Tried to blow some air into it as suggested online but it didn't help. (I keep it pretty clean its not dirty and gunky)I use it for playing WoW and I use all the buttons. I have been using Naga's for around 10 years and they almost always develop a double click issue.In terms of connectivity and battery life I didn't have any problem. The docking station is really finicky with the connection sometimes doesn't recognize the mouse and you need to reseat it a couple of times.I am too used to it by now to switch to something else hopefully next version will have optical switches on all the buttons.
5,Love the modular design but I just stick with the circular button layout. Works great 👍
3,I got this because I was told it was THE wireless mmo mouse. It is the only I've found with as many configurable buttons. It fits my small hand well.The first I received had incredibly loose side buttons to the point just picking it up and barely touching the side buttons had it clicking. Trying to play with it I was constantly bumping abilities I didn't want. Returned it for a second and it was PERFECT. Way less sensitive but still responsive and I had no issues with accidentally clicking buttons.But. The second died suddenly out of nowhere after only two months. I use my mice gently and only a couple hours a day and still two months in it just died overnight completely and wouldn't even recognize being charged. I had gone to bed with it at about 80% battery but the next morning it was just a piece of plastic.Going through both Amazon and Razer (since it was unfortunately just out of my return policy) it took a while to get my replacement mouse.And guess what? The third one has the same issues the first had. I can hardly play with it because the side buttons are so loose they click without me intending to. This and the first mouse are like completely different mice in practice than the second that had worked so well (until it straight up died).Not going to be buying another and don't really recommend unless their quality control improves.
4,Ended up giving this mouse to my daughter even though my hands are larger.Very big mouse that wants you to rest your hand on I am very used to a claw tyoe of grip and just couldn't get used to it.If the side button panels had a thumb rest it might have been different.Don't buy if you like a claw type grip for flicking your mouse around.Do buy if you like a mouse you rest your hand on.Razer software configures buttons easily and automatically updates when you change the side button panel.
5,Had this mouse for little over a year now and absolutely love it. Fits nicely in the palm of my hand for easy gliding while gaming. It is a little smaller overall than I would like but I just have bigger than normal hands. Functionality for gaming and setting it up was super easy. Love the changeable parts for preference to button layout on the side. Highly recommend it. I've tried several different gaming mice over the years but this one by far is my favorite to date.
5,I love the wireless modes of this mouse. Being able to swap between wireless 2.4ghz connected to my desktop and bluetooth connected to my laptop with the flick of a switch is amazing. I love how smooth this mouse glides the contact surfaces are much better than my old G600. The sensor accuracy is better and doesn't lose focus. Sometimes i'd have to pick my G600 up and put it back down several times for it to start tracking again. The click is significantly softer this is much less fatiguing while playing click heavy games like Diablo 3 and Call of Duty. It's much much lighter maybe not the lightest mouse around but its way lighter than my old G600 and definitely not the 'heavyweight' that the reviews keep spouting. This weight issue initially turned me away from it but i finally decided to go for it anyway and i'm glad i did.
4,There really isn't much to say about the mouse at this point because the keypad function has been a staple for years and not much has changed. The one negative I have about the mouse so far is that you don't have left/right on the middle mouse wheel. The tilt effect seems like something that should be a standard feature at this point especially at the price point of this mouse.I've only had it for a short while but there are no right click issues yet. Though I've had issues with the mouse clicking on all past versions owned. Sometimes with in warranty and sometimes after warranty expires. This version uses different switch if I understand the features marketing correctly so maybe that gets addressed.Even with a flaw that seemingly hits every generation at random I'd still recommend this mouse. Or at least a keypad mouse. It really comes in handy in more then just gaming. It really makes me wonder why keypad mice are not standard in business settings because of how handy it really is for anything that involves number entry.
5,good mouse feels great in hand lots of buttons
5,wireless options good/ good response time. same as the old in terms of erganomics could be slimmed down a bit but its something if gotten used too with the original version. does feel lighter than original.
4,Needs better grip and battery life overall it's great sometimes uncomfortable to use
5,Great mouse! Only complaint is the adapter that has a bunch of buttons those buttons are so sensitive that I can’t use it because ill just keep pressing one of them by accident.
3,Firstly the mouse gets great reviews my buddy uses it & loves it. However it isn't for me.Naga Trinity: The feeling of it is very flat & wide no arch so I'm basically lying my hand on it but because it has a ring finger rest (hate) it makes it hard to without using my entire hand. Its difficult to explain.Positive is the software fantastic software for remapping etc.G502: Fantastic. Feels great plenty of extra buttons in nice locations. Not 12 but I couldn't even think of what to add to over half on the Naga. Con is the software. It is absolute garbage but if you can figure it out its hands down a superior mouse.
4,As an avid pc gamer for the last 14 years I've gone through many mice. I play a variety of games. Started on World of Warcraft and then some first person battle royals and shooters. I bought this mouse because I recently got into FFXIV. It was annoying for me to use 1-12 on the keyboard So this was my go to. The two extra attachments for the mouse are nice for MOBA and Shooters. The toggle button to adjust your dpi on the mouse is nice and paired with Razor Synapse. You can easily control the speed of the mouse at which ever speed fits for whatever game you are playing. It glides really nice along my mousepad. Even more so than my FPS mouse Logitech g502 hyperspeed. The only downfalls of this mouse for me is that the battery life on it is very short. I play from 3-8+ hours a day 5/7 days a week. During one session of gaming the mouse needs to be charged.  Compared to my Logitech that can go DAYS without needing it as well as my Pro X headset. The other downside for me of this mouse is that its very bulky. Just plain big and doesn't form well to my hand like other mice to. So to my friends who use a lot of keybinds and numbers while playing games. This mouse is great. For you Shooter gamers I would look into Steelseries or Logitech higher end mice.
4,This mouse is great for both office use and games. It's easy to program the buttons feels good in my large hands and the wheel scrolls smoothly. The resolution button makes it easy to adjust the mouse speed.My only complaint is that the number buttons are a bit too easy to push. I often find myself accidentally clicking a button when I don't want to. It's not easy to get this right and my last mouse's side buttons were a little too stiff. I have trained myself not to apply pressure to the buttons when I'm mousing normally but I forget sometimes.Aside from that minor problem this is an excellent mouse.
5,Everything you would expect to work well on the mouse does it's super high quality and I haven't run into any issues thus far after a few months of ownership.Main complaint is the battery life when using 2.4ghz mode feels short like maybe a week of use every day before it needs a recharge. Though if you switch to Bluetooth mode it will save battery life significantly so I chalk this up to limits of current technology rather than a bad design. Also had lighting brightness at 70%2.4ghz is insanely fast feels no different than a wired mouse. Lighting can get very bright if desired. Can also appreciate that when you do need to charge it you can plug the mouse in with the cable used for wireless transmitter and it instantly starts working and there's no lag of the computer figuring out a mouse was plugged in seamless transition from wireless to wired.Weight is good all of the buttons feel and sound great. The size isn't huge so people with big hands you can use it but hitting those back row buttons can be a stretch but the width of the mouse feels great.
5,I have used the naga line since I replaced my WoW mouse back in 2011 finally had to replace it 11 years later. Don't like the loose cable cover on the new on but ill get over it I suppose.
5,Pretty good wireless mouse. Bought it for the extra buttons (specifically the 6 button set up) and was initially worried about the weight for online FPS games. Im no pro by any means but the weight hasn't effected me at all. It's been about a year now and the mouse is still as good as new.
5,Very nice item!
4,EDIT: The clicking issue happened to me 4 months in on a 100 dollar mouse and it's unplayable. Unacceptable to me honestly because this is a known issue and they do nothing to fix it.2nd EDIT: Moving back up to 4 stars because the customer service experience was remarkable easy and the people are extremely pleasant to deal with. They are shipping me out my new mouse as we speak they paid for all shipping. Maybe the build has suffered over the years but I have now tried the following 12 button mice and the razor in terms of performance is far superior in every way: Logitech Corsair Red Dragon both builds and Utech and nothing compares and I mean it's not even close. The razor buttons are so crisp to click and ultra-responsive so easy to push and it feels good doing it. Every other mouse the Logitech being the worst corsair being the next best down from razor feels like you have to smash the button to get a response and that just feels bad when you need fast fingers and a fast response. Hope this review helps someone. best wishes.My old Naga Epic Chroma finally had to be laid to rest after years as the scroll wheel issues that the mouse is known for finally came about. I tried the Logitech 12 button because it was much cheaper than the Trinity and that mouse can kick rocks as far as I'm concerned felt like I had to step on the buttons to get them to press in comparison to razor buttons. The Trinity went on sale for 55 bucks couldn't believe it for a minute and I pulled the trigger instantly. I honestly couldn't be happier the buttons feel extremely crisp and precise the Trinity is a definite upgrade from the old version in the terms of feel and laser this mouse is on point. The movement is clean and again the buttons feel awesome. Software is as good as ever not sure why people make a big fuss about this as I've never had issues with synapse and no double-clicking issues people have mentioned. I will come back and edit if that happens though. I've tried just about every 12 button mouse there is Corsair Logitech the Utech and Red Dragon nothing even comes close in my personal opinion if you have the extra cash or can wait for it to go on sale again do not hesitate to buy this mouse you will be100 percent satisfied I have no doubt. I have bigger hands and it fits perfectly and the buttons are simple to find and press no issues with misclicks what so ever but I already have the muscle memory for this button layout. Give it a week if you are new to 12 button mouses you will be happy you did.
5,way back in 2001 or thereabout i bought a death adder when razer only had maybe three input devices total.  it was a great mouse but i always felt pretty annoyed by the cheesy aesthetics that razer uses.  so when it finally ate sh*t i didn't re up.  i remember noticing the early version of the Razer Naga and getting super peeved at how stupid it looked.  in my defense it does look stupid.  look it up.  really bad.  fast forward twenty years and plenty of the competition's flag ship pointing devices later and i see this newer model with the option to jettison the MOBA grid for other button configurations buy it used and within ten minutes of setting it up i realized that it's THE cheesy stupid looking bull sh*t epic gamer mouse of my dreams.  i can't imagine trying to use something else.  i use the plate with two rows of three keys.  i can't emphasize enough how much i love the way it handles the "ring" finger.  i am an idiot.  this is a great mouse.  if i had to complain about something it has to be directed at the software.  I'm not and never was a synapse hater.  i don't think it's awesome but i don't really like anything else better either.  there are just certain limitations with any of the big brand mouse softwares.  seems like none of them can ever get everything and each of them seems to have something exclusive and really useful. my issue is just that the things they lack always seem to be an oversight instead of a technical limitation.  with synapse there is a feature that i think is relatively new but it's a really awesome concept that i think they executed badly.  the global shortcuts feature could be extremely powerful but Razer imposed several limits to keep people from accidentally screwing their computer up.  it's sad.  if they could only lock the potentially 'dangerous' functions behind a disclaimer or something for people who are willing to take the risk they would have a super powerful feature that i don't think anyone else offers at all.  also they should allow you to invoke the Razer hypershift function from any device (only Razer brand devices can hypershift) because it's not very useful to hypershift a mouse using your mouse hand.  think about it.
4,Great gaming mouse. Needs a little more weight on it to be perfect
5,I enjoy being able to change out the button plate for whatever game I’m playing at the time. The round one I use most of all but the 9 key is a close second!
4,It would have been a 5/5.  It would have been a 10/5.  However all the other nagas had a scroll wheel tilt click.  So I got used to it.  For some reason Razer didn't include it in this model.  That said it is by far the most reliable razer mmo mouse I have ever had.
4,This is my first Naga from Razer. The 12-button configuration is a struggle to tell the buttons apart. I found that the 6-button configuration was best for how much easier it is to differentiate the buttons from each other.The rubbery spots to enforce grip are not all that helpful and the mouse altogether feels slippery.Aside from that I still recommend this product. It is a definite upgrade from the DeathAdder V2 in functionality and a massive upgrade of the many Corsair mice I’ve had before (in terms of durability).
5,I purchased this to replace my Razer Naga Trinity.  After a year of heavy use the side plate connection on the Naga Trinity started to become unreliable.  This means that the 12 side buttons randomly become unresponsive for seconds at a time.  While I otherwise liked the Naga Trinity very much this was unacceptable for my use.  Luckily the main difference with this Naga X is a fixed side panel albeit offering only the 12 button option.  The hope was that this would prevent any connectivity errors with the rest of the mouse and prevent random black-outs of the 12 side buttons.  So far so good but it's only been a month or so.IMO the 12 side buttons are a much better option than the other two panel types on the Naga Trinity anyways and are a great addition for any game.  I even find them irreplaceable for a shooter like Doom.  Freeing up your left hand from having to press the number keys is great for better character mobility.  It is also much faster and accurate to use your right thumb to reach the higher numbers on the mouse panel than your left hand stretching to reach them on the keyboard.  The 12 side buttons also great for calculation and number input.  With some configuration it is easy to move a lot more key use to these buttons through the use of Razer hypershift as well.All other features of the mouse are great.  It is very similar to the Naga Trinity.  However it is noticeably lighter has no side tilt on the scroll wheel and has a single recessed mouse button below the scroll wheel as opposed to two raised buttons on the Naga Trinity.  I actually found all of these features to be improvements for my use.  For example I would rather have one button for alternating between two DPI settings quickly than two that are easier to accidentally hit.  People with greater finger dexterity may miss these lost features.
4,I had the previous model version of this mouse from a few years ago not sure if it had a different name or not but it was similarly priced. This one is definitely lighter and cheaper feeling compared to that. It also doesn't have the ability to push the mouse wheel left and right like the previous one did which was a let down. It lacks the middle up and down buttons for adjusting the sensitivity but not a big deal for me. The buttons in general though are noticeably easier to press which is kind of annoying as I keep accidentally clicking buttons. The Razer logo also lacks rgb lighting but I don't really care about that either. Lastly the '1' button has already exhibited difficulty in registering a button press after just a couple of weeks of use. Thankfully after giving that button a good hard press it seems to be back to normal but it doesn't inspire confidence in how long this mouse will last.
2,SECOND EDIT 7-9-22 - Same double clicking issues that were appearing on my naga trinity are now appearing on this mouse as well. This is my last naga. If they even let me RMA their defect ill just hand it off they picked poor switches can't incorporate hardware memory for their settings forcing you to leave their software running and increased prices to the point of extremes. I'm going to give that new steelseries one a shot if it goes on sale or just stick with Utech or Redragon models. A shelf price 80$ mouse that doesn't last even 1 year of use is ridiculous and while also retaining design flaws from previous models. Razer you disappointed me. Also for context on usage I started working full time around when I got this mouse. So it has had less usage than my trinity my older naga 2014 and OG naga epic. While I would still use it daily it was maybe 2-3 hours a day on average instead of old 8+ a day when I rocked full on college life. So at least the one I sent was EXTREMELY flimsy to get a better picture of how much of a step back this thing is.Edit 4-10-22 - wore down the pads enough to reach a usable state still not the biggest fan of this mouse but it's at least passable. Doesn't feel like it will last very long but has held up a few months now. Once it breaks its getting replaced with a cheaper redragon as seems like the MMO mouse market is leaving the mainstream level of quality. Tried to buy a used Very Good naga epic off here and the left click was non functional and while that might be amazons fault it just isn't out of the realm of possibility for razer.  GGWorks but has terrible rubber pads that damaged my mouse pad plus have terrible resistance nice pennies saved Razer!I want to start off with saying I love the Razer Naga series. They have been my favorite mice ever since I bought the first Naga before RGB branding was even a thing. It was the best mice until it died after several years of good use. Saddly the Naga 2014 was defective by design so I opted to avoid that one. I finally returned with the Naga Trinity which served great for about 2 years until the left click stopped holding a few days ago. Money is a bit tight right now so I was glad to see a cheaper option instead of having to opt for the Naga pro which I would have liked. I only use the MMO faceplate in most scenarios anyway so I was excited to be back in business. However the mouse came and has blank white pads on the bottom that are stiff and don't flow well on my mousemat in fact they actually leave scratch marks  after use. Every other Razer mouse I have owned always had slim black pads on the bottom so this was a bit odd to see and they don't seem to be some protection layer that can be peeled off. I really like the design on my mouse pad so I'm a bit upset to have scratched it up and not sure if I just got a unit that shouldn't have passed QA. The fact that the last few Naga's have been degrading in quality with bad sensors double clicking IMO pointless faceplate's and features taken to only be given back later in a pro model (wired/wireless mode was in the first naga then taken away only to just return with the dock sold separately at a way higher premium).To summarize It looks like it worked out of the box but the fact that the pads have really bad resistance against a speed mat (which literally 10+ other mice of varying brands and quality have never had an issue with) actually damaged the mat and I can't verify if this is just a defect as Razer leaves no product images of the bottom of the mouse on their page on top of the bad track record they have been building up over the last few Naga's I might have to just go around testing other mice as I don't think I can trust another one of these mice.
5,I absolutely love this mouse. I had bought it for playing Tarkov because my basilisk had too few buttons. It has three swappable pads for programmable buttons the Fps which has two the Battle Royale which has 6 and the MMO which has 12. The mouse is pretty wide and with the MMO pad it does get pretty chunky. Smaller hands will find it harder to use. Battery life is pretty good a full charge while gaming can last quite a while maybe 3 or 4 days with up to 4 to 5 hours of use for those days. Obviously this is a Razer mouse so it will ask you to install the Synapse 3 software to get the full use of the mouse. Dpi can go very high I stay within the range of 1800 to 3000.
3,I've been using Naga mice for a little over a decade now. They have always had a few problems the biggest and most persistent being the double clicking which will turn using your own computer into hard mode. It's never a matter of "if" but "when." You can absolutely bank on it. For me it seems to take about two years but as you can see from other negative reviews sometimes these mice don't even last a year. Razer products are always a gamble like this.A recent issue I've found and why I'm writing this review to begin with is at some point or perhaps by my luck of the draw I ended up with a Naga made in Taiwan. As far as I know all my previous Naga had been made in China. I noticed an immediate set of differences in the mouse compared to my old one: sharper angles thinner pads on the bottom that are near flush with the mouse itself less shiny housing etc. Minor aesthetic things only a neurotic would notice whatever. But then I used the thing.My mouse was squeaking. Nearly every time I dragged along the horizontal it'd squeak. I tolerated this for a while until I couldn't any longer and dug out my old Naga to see what was going on because I've never had a Naga that SQUEAKS.The 12 button side panel as well as the 7 button one are minutely sharper thicker and more angled on the Taiwanese Naga. The top of the bottom edge of the panel scrapes as you drag making that squeaking sound. Besides the maddening squeak I have to wonder over the long term if this would damage the surface underneath the mouse. I'll never know for sure because I immediately replaced it with my old 12 button side panel and the squeaking went away. If that's not an option to you I hope you enjoy filing down your hundred dollar mouse.Maybe this was a one off. Maybe it's a new factory and they're still working out the equipment kinks. Maybe current events have made their quality control even worse than before. All I know is I'm trapped in an abusive relationship with a peripheral manufacturer and it just keeps getting worse. There's also something to be said about how the Naga X is missing not only the scroll wheel tilt inputs but also one of the middle buttons forcing you to spend twenty dollars just to have a feature complete mouse with the Trinity forget if you have no intention of ever using the 7 or 2 button side panels. It's so wasteful and dumb.
4,Much larger than previous iterations and feels "more plastic" and cheaper made than older versions but is still a good gaming mouse
5,Replaced an older worn out naga with this newer model. The sensor on this one does seem to work a lot better than my previous one.
4,The only MMO mouse that is wireless from a name brand company.Features: comes with PTFE mouse feet which is very generous and not common usually you buy these aftermarket.fairly light considering all the hardware on it. another big plus.comes with 3 side plates. one with 12 buttons one with 2 and one with I think 6? very cool and convenient and easy to swap out.no perceivable latency however I originally bought this mouse used. it would lose connection for several seconds which is unusable for gaming and just annoying in any other application especially at this price.I returned it and bought a new one which has the same issue but only loses connectivity very briefly enough for me to just ignore. I dont play shooters or 1st person games with it so whatever.the razer software has automatic profile switching. you can set up specific keybinds for any program (even ones that arent games) and when you switch to a different program the keybinds automatically swap. this is insanely useful for video editing music production MMOs all kinds of things.battery life is great. naturally the lights suck a lot of it up but you should turn them off if you want it to last long.I like the ergonomics a lot I think it feels great in my hand. it's meant to be held with your fingers laid on it and your palm mostly lifted off of it. it feels very comfortable but I'd like it slightly lighter for easier movement.if it werent for the disconnection this would be 5/5 stars. it has zero ccompetition is feature packed and is good at what it does.
5,I’ve had this mouse for the better part of 2 months now and it is an incredible piece of technology. Although the razer software for its product customization is a bit clunky you just gotta be patient and it will eventually work just fine.Things to note:- The default of the 12 button clasp is to the numbers at the top of your keyboard. I recommend changing these to the number pad for gaming purposes such as guild wars 2 or WoW.- 6 button clasp is the same way as 12 button clasp just need to remap the configuration.- 2 button clasp acts normal - great for FPS’s like Valorant and CoD.- The onboard mappings are useful for switching between games or game styles but do not change the color patterns unless you’ve opened up the razer chroma software and can identify your profiles.Overall this mouse has made my gaming experience super fluid and I will not be going back to a regular mouse 😁
4,I had to reorder this mouse because when it arrived it simply didn't turn on without a wire plugged. Apparently this is a common issue and the only thing you can do is order a replacement. So don't tear open the packaging as soon as it comes make sure it works. But when it works it works great.
1,Edit: lowering to one star just to make an impact against buying this mouse until Razer fixes the Synapse software issues. No I'm not going to deal with putting in a support ticket. I have a recurring issue where the software will steal windows focus. Popups are literally so annoying and even worse it doesn't even show the popup window unless you press "enter" while the focus is captured. It shows a cloud sync conflict. Even if I try to clear that up it just happens again later.What I wanted: a rechargeable wireless mouse with excellent tracking and feel with an MMO numpad (why I went with this over Logitech). This was the only mouse on the market.So I'm back a year later. Within a few months:- The left click started getting a bit weird like there is some kind of debris under it. Tapping the mouse on something makes it go away temporarily. (I was afraid of "tapping" something costing 2.5x as much as my keyboard but after a few months of disappointment I tend to get curious.)- The scrollwheel started to get a bit weird (seems Razer consistently has trouble with this). The scrollwheel is getting worse over time with inconsistent jumps when using it.- What is worse is the "key chatter" when clicking the scrollwheel. Earlier in the product life it hardly had a problem but now when I click it there is a good chance it will double-click basically nullifying the previous click if you want to toggle quick-scroll on a web page during work or auto-run in a game.- Sometimes the button panels need to be reseated (pulled off put back on to make sure the thumb buttons work). I don't really care for "multiple button panels." Why would I ever want less buttons or to torment myself with a different mouse feel for different games? I have played Diablo 3 CS:GO and WOW all at high levels with a Naga 2012 and it is safe to say the only thing that matters is: working buttons and tracking.- A few tracking issues. The mouse overall has good tracking but sometimes I would notice periodic glitches. I thought it was just my computer being slow but then I realized the only thing freezing was my mouse. Reconnecting it in makes that problem go away if it ever happens. Luckily reconnecting is very easy when the cord extends to your desk into the wireless adapter.- The software is also bad. I have had my profile magically reset sometimes (all of my key bindings) and I can just tell that this thing could be coded better. What is it with hardware manufacturers not having a respectable software pipeline?I would chalk some of this up to "unlucky manufacturer faults" but after having survived a nightmare of tracking issues with my Naga 2014 Razer needs to improve their manufacturing process for these things especially if they are going to cost 2.5x as much as my functional keyboard (Razer keyboard actually seems pretty good - check my Razer Cynosa review). A bit pricey for a mouse with this many problems.So why 3 stars and not 1? The mouse is OK. My main gripe currently is the mousewheel button having key chatter. That is the only thing getting in the way of "functional". And I could care less about anything not affecting functionality or just being a temporary quirk that can be solved mainly by reconnecting.Pros:- It's wireless and tracks good. The wireless dongle extends right to your mousepad so you don't need to worry about a bad connection.- Visible RGB warning when the battery is low. Easy to take the plug out of the little dongle and plug in the mouse.- Battery lasts plenty - days of use and all you need to do is plug it in.- The cord is lightweight and flexible so it doesn't push on the mouse much when plugged in.Overall I'm more satisfied than dissatisfied so 3 stars here. Much better experience than my Naga 2014 with a critical tracking defect (and with the amount of people who had that problem it pointed the fault to Razer and not bad luck).If you're a gamer you'll run into a few minor problems that can be solved simply by reconnecting (either the cord or the button panel). I have not had any problems occur within hours after reconnecting.
5,Idk many other people who need to multi macro outside of mmos or gaming keybinding to it but is great. Is best. Is reasonable price if you don’t want it to be ugly like Logitech stuff
5,Let me start off by saying that I wasn't looking to spend this much money on a wireless gaming mouse when I was looking for one but after pulling the trigger and using it I am VERY glad that I did.  Not only does this mouse fit perfectly against my hand (I'm a palm guy) everything else about it has been superb so far.  The battery life is amazing the precision is phenomenal and the multiple side attachments are great.  I play ESO most of the time and the option to have 12 thumb buttons is great although I opt for the 6 button side attachment for ESO so I can have the thumb grip as well.One thing about using the 12 button attachment is that it's hard to try picking up the mouse and moving it quickly without pressing a button you may have mapped.  Other than that it's greatOne issue I had when I first installed this mouse is that none of the lighting would work.  I found the issue to be that the contacts just needed to be cleaned for the 12 button attachment and then everything worked.  The other two attachments worked fine right away.  All I did was blow on them and wipe them with the inside of my t-shirt to solve that problem.  Synapse software is working fine so far as well.A lot of the bad reviews for this mouse are from people I believe purchased this mouse from a 3rd party seller for a cheaper price.  To make sure you're always getting the best technology and legit new in-box make sure you're getting a "Sold from and Shipped by Amazon" product.  You'll avoid those possible "used and not working properly" issues.Mouse comes with a 2.4Ghz wireless adapter can connect Bluetooth if you prefer that instead or wired as it comes with a wired USB cable for charging.  It also supports the Razer wireless mouse charging base if you want to add that if used with a desktop.VERY good mouse... highly recommend!!!
3,I bought it for the high precision and high mass. Its well engineered and fabricated. It feels good in my hand though the buttons are super sensitive. I still press the side buttons inadvertently as well as the two speed controlling buttons in front of the scroll wheel. Most of those problems are acclamation issues I expect.My big problem with this mouse is the software. The third day of using my new workstation the OS froze and would not accept input after booting. After a few hours and countless reboots uninstalling things in Win10 safe mode I traced it back to the mouse software which I had to uninstall in order for it to not freeze the OS after boot. Note that its mostly a bare system still and everything is brand new. I waited a few days and reinstalled the software. Two days later it caused the freeze issue again. To be clear the freezing I describe is that the OS is running (time updates tooltips work cursor moves background process are working) but if I interact with any control or program it hangs with no way of coming back. Ctrl+Alt+Del is not an option either since the task manager opening causes it to hang nor will not respond if the problem has occurred and the computer is already hanged. This problem is repeatable. Since I uninstalled it the problem has not occurred. In my opinion its an issue with the software. A lesser issue is that the LED color is set by the software so now I have a beautifully lit color themed workstation with a rainbow color mouse since you can only change the color with the software running.Historically I've always gone Logitech and they rarely have let me down. I'm kind of wishing I had remained so. Some time in the future I plan on making this a spare part and returning to Logitech. I would not recommend solely due to the software.
4,Only just got it but seems to do the trick.  The ergonomic for my hand seems not great but time will tell if I can used to it.
4,I REALLY wish they had this sort of tech years ago... being able to swap back and forth between an MMO style mouse while gaming and a standard two side button design for office use is just FANTASTIC!! I'm taking off one star because in order to keep the custom RGB Lighting profile you have to have Razer Synapse installed AND RUNNING in the background of your machine which takes a good amount of resources. Other than that I'm SUPER thrilled with it so far!!
3,I'll keep it short since I've had this mouse for a month and a few weeks or so. Mouse is decent. tracks well. Sensibility works. Side buttons feel OK. Overall it's a good mouse. Not great. But good. I think it's a bit overpriced because of the build quality... see it works like a PRO mouse in terms of functionalities and such... but it feels like a cheap mouse included with a dell computer... flimsy and like it'll break anytime soon. I'm a bit worried about the "double-click" issue i've been reading in recent reviews.What I don't really like about this mouse is how small and light it is. Again another reason why I feel it's very overpriced. This may be very personal but I do have a big hand and this mouse is tiny for me. Also it would've been nice to include some weights to add to it like other "pro" gaming mouse include. The other thing is battery life. Not sure if this is something normal since I come from a wired gaming mouse but this one lasts a day at most. And i'm no hardcore gamer... i just play like 2-3 hours a day. I have another wireless mouse not gaming mouse but that one lasts weeks and i use it everyday for work. So 8hrs a day lasts ~2 weeks versus 2-3 hours that lasts ~1 day? I dunno may be the higher DPI but getting a "low battery" from the software every-single-day have made me use it wired all of the time. So... not great IMHO.
4,The mouse I received has an issue with the number 2 sidekey. About 1 in 10 clicks it does not register. I am returning it.EDIT: Changing it to 4 stars as I got a replacement from my local best buy and it works great. I must have gotten unlucky the 1st time. It would have been 5 stars if the first mouse wasn't defective.
5,Great for hacks.I think dunno.
5,Slightly larger than the mouse i've been using but once I got used to it it is a great fit. highly recommend.
5,I haven’t tried the multi-user buttons on the bottom but all other features work great. I don’t use this for gaming but it’s extremely handy for quick access shortcuts. Programming each button is easy and lasts even when you program on one computer and plug into another and it’s really easy to swap between button pads without any feeling of cheapness
5,My old razer mouse was a mess in the end it wasn't useful for games the shortcut buttons were a mess and the driver issues were a pain. Games didn't register to the mouse profiles.Now for this mouse I went for it because I wanted to see this gimmick of 3 face plates. This gimmick is great. I play heroes of the storm so the two button plate is perfect since more characters are using less extra buttons. The MMO faceplate is great for well MMO's no issues with final fantasy xiv. The 7 button plate is perfect for every day use since I use it for opening closing creating and reloading tabs. Reduces the extra shortcuts used on the keyboard. Customizing the left and right wheel clicks is a huge plus which was one of the reasons I got this my old MMO mouse was great but the missing wheel click shortcuts were missing which I really really wanted.One of the better things with this mouse though is the software is much better this time around but it's still annoying that you need a profile. This time around however there's a button you click on the bottom of the mouse to switch profiles. So if you're like me and you don't trust the software to properly sync up to a game then just press that button and you're good to go. Also if you're like me and you tab out of games and then go back in just remember that button on the bottom.There are a lot of extras to this mouse that I haven't tested. I just went straight to customizing buttons and colors. I wish steelseries had a mouse like this but for now this is probably one of the best mice out there at the moment. Biggest gripe is that it's a little small and for a guy I have medium sized hands so that's saying something but I'm adjusting.
5,Recently bought this as an upgrade to my original Razer Naga Epic that I purchased back in 2013. Not that the old mouse was broken just felt like it was time for an upgrade. My daughter is now using my old mouse and this one is getting broke in playing World of Warcraft and being used for casual office work. I don't use the option for the 7 button configuration but for those who play MOBAs it seems like it could be a great option.The keys are a bit more "squishy" than the previous model and the keys wiggle slightly (I wiggle them frequently between actions as a habit now). Cable is braded which feels sturdy and has a silicon cable tie attached for easy management if your a laptop gamer like me. Finally a difference between this and the older Naga is the addition of a finger rest on the right side of the mouse which is nice because I use to have to swap out a side panel to get that.For the software the Razer Synapse application lets you build profiles that can be loaded per game. If you frequent between different genres this is a fantastic tool. If you're like me and just go between one or two titles and office work you'll likely feel this is unnecessary bloat but hey you can control the lights so that's cool.
5,The mouse is great for gaming l I just wish it was a little taller but I have big hands so for someone else it should be fine you can put much needed hockey's at the flick of your thumb really upped my gaming
5,I've had this mouse awhile.. With the interchangable side plates this is the best gaming mouse I've ever owned. The 12 button side panel is prolly my fav. From Elden Ring to Elder Scrolls having custom side buttoms seems like ez mode cheating :)
5,I know Razer gets a bad reputation for quality.  I have owned 6 of their products over the years with no major issues.  So this review comes from someone who has not had major problems with the brand in the past.  My outlook towards the brand in general is somewhat favorable but I acknowledge the various issues people have raised over the years.To start I bought this to  retire my original 2012 Razer Naga which was still in perfect working order.  I just wanted a new one.  Anyways this is the generational equivalent of the Naga being the  only mouse they have for sale that features a full 12 button side profile.Its nice and heavy. Its a bit larger that the 2012 Naga.  My larger than average hand fits comfortably on top of it without any fingers dragging around on my surface.  The 2 and 8 button panels have rubbery grip pads that give a little extra grip.  The panels easily switch in and out without fuss mid-anything and switch Synapse over to the default profile for whatever one you popped in.  The 12 and 8 button panels feature rgb lighting while the 2 button does not.  I found all the panels incredibly comfortable.  Both the mouse and accompanying panels handle perspiration incredibly well and my grip hasnt been compromised at any point.One thing to note about this product and other Synapse 3.0 compatible devices is that you can save button profiles to the actual devices allowing you to plug and play on different systems without logging into your profile (though I am not certain if they can  be used without a native install of Synapse 3.0)Only con I have is that its not backwards compatible with Synapse 2.0.  Meaning that since I have an older Razer keyboard that DOES use 2.0 I wont have use of the inter-device  functionalities such as using keyboard buttons to change mouse sensitivity but this is minor and I hardly ever used those features.  I  do however have to run both Synapse 2.0 and 3.0 in order to properly support both of my currently in-use Razer devices.  And I would rather not.
5,I use this on my main computer and I got it for playing World of warcraft. I liked the idea of the wheel of buttons on the side because I can wrap my head around that set up for regular use but I wanted to try out other options to see what worked best and this ended up being perfect. I love how the panels just snap in easily with magnets and they stay on very securely. The texture is great and it really feels premium. The scroll wheel is one of the best I have used and feels very precise. Being able to map the buttons exactly how I need them is great. I mostly run tank characters so being able to have easily accessible taunts and interrupts is great! I also mapped movement abilities to the wheel so it has really increased my mobility in game. I also just as a quality of life thing have my autorun mapped to one of the buttons because I use that constantly and I only ever need one hand to move.This is entirely me but I thought I would share in case this is useful information for someone. The one thing I am still trying to get used to is the weight and my grip. I had a much lighter mouse before and I have a habit of picking them up to move them. This was before I understood what the mouse sensitivity was(which is weird because I am otherwise very knowledgeable about computers and even built two from scratch so this was a dumb moment for me). As a woman I frequently run into gaming things mostly being made for men so this mouse is just bordering on slightly big but it's manageable. I think the grip is different as well and I am trying to figure out a way to use it regularly to where my hand doesn't get numb which again is entirely on me and getting used to a new mouse.
1,So about 4-5 months ago my Razer Naga Chroma had a problem with two of the side buttons (1 and 7) requiring significantly more force than intended to actuate. I wasn't surprised that the mouse was having problems as I usually have to replace Razer mice after a couple years or so and this one was reaching the end of its life. The search for a new mouse began and unfortunately I had built an unhealthy reliance on the 12 side buttons and Razer Synapse software for the MMOs I play. I was unable to find a "regular" Razer Naga on the market other than 3rd party amazon sellers charging upwards of $150. My only options were this overpriced mouse with the interchangeable side buttons which I have absolutely no use for or going with a different company. Boy do I regret going with the former.When I first received the mouse it was mildly frustrating that the layout and feel of the buttons as well as shape size weight of the mouse and scroll wheel had changed drastically (for the worse) since my last Naga. I've been using Razer Nagas for 8 years and have never complained about the changes (and they've gone through a lot since the Razer Naga Epic back in 2010) but these are terrible.Since day 1 the scroll wheel (which now scrolls in huge clicky steps) has had this extremely frustrating problem where it scrolls down after finishing a scroll up and vice versa. This is a huge problem in everything I do on my computer from video games to browsing the internet. Trying to use an ability bound to scroll down only for it to also use the ability I have bound to scroll up. Trying to scroll up on a webpage only for it to scroll back down a notch after I reach the top. This is awful and it happens all the time but that's not the only problem with this mouse.After only a couple weeks of use the side mouse buttons would completely stop working. I was infuriated with this but I found that taking off the side panel blowing it off and replacing it fixed the problem. This I could deal with as long as it only happened a couple times a month. But it's started to happen every other day now. It's very frustrating when you're in the middle of a game and half of your keybinds are unusable because of your poorly designed mouse!Though this may just be a personal problem this is the first mouse out of the Razer lineup where I've experienced severe pain in my right hand. I believe this is due to poorly designed ergonomics and the increased weight of the mouse. This mouse has taken 50 steps back from the mouse they released 8 years ago. It's crazy!Now for the most recent problem. The last straw and why this will be the last time I purchase something from Razer again. Yesterday I noticed in World of Warcraft that my character was constantly stuttering while moving by holding both mouse buttons. I figured that it was some kind of FPS lag but no the mouse already has the infamous Razer double clicking problem. About half of my left clicks are registered twice now which makes this mouse completely unusable. It's hard to believe that even though I've taken such great care of this mouse it's already falling apart where it sits.This experience has really made me reflect on how Razer has intentionally let the quality of their products decline over the years. They build their products to fall apart by the time they release their next model just so you're inclined to upgrade. I remember enjoying my Razer Naga Epic for over 4 years without any problems and buying the next version because I was EXCITED for it. In fact my brother still uses that same old mouse for occasional gaming and the only thing that doesn't work is the scroll wheel click. Unfortunately the only time I shop for Razer products any more is because my old one broke and being that kind of consumer is not for me. I appreciate the quality and durability of products I purchase and unfortunately this product completely lacks both.Hopefully I can find a quality durable mouse from somewhere else that meets my needs but I would rather taper my dependence on those side buttons than ever purchase a mouse from Razer again.
3,My Naga Pro has finally seen the end of it’s life and here are the results. After 18 months and putting around 3000 combined hours in Hunt: Showdown and Cold War using this mouse (claw grip). The ergonomics of this mouse were comfortable to use for long hours and the soft pads were nice while they were there. Definitely recommend this mouse for a casual-gamer. (I gave this mouse a 3-star only because of the pain Razer Synapse gives me constantly adding a new default profile every time I start my PC)
4,Don’t get me wrong. I saw reviews and this was one of the must famous MMORPG mouse out there. I wanted to play WoW but was too complicated for my noob-after-work level of gaming.I know pros use it but it was not comfortable for me I rather the good ol’ buttons all around the mouse and not only on the left. (Talking about steel series WoW mouse).
4,Went looking for a cheap MMO mouse to try out and was surprised to see this marked down by more than half after a return so I figured it was worth a shot and have been very happy with it. The only damage was to the external packaging the mouse itself has been fine.It's a little lighter than I was anticipating but a good size with a button grid on the side with different planes to make the buttons more distinct via feel. Required minimal fiddling with Razer settings to configure as desired and has decently precise movement. As long as this lasts a couple years which I see no reason to believe otherwise would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for an MMO style mouse.
3,This is one of the best mouse I have purchased unfortunately also one of the worst.  Great for gaming and easy to use and recharge. BUT there is no way to replace the battery if needed without actually tearing the mouse apart and finding a electrician to help you.
4,I bought this mouse in hopes it would help with the games I play. I owned a mouse that had 9 buttons on the side some years back and it done pretty well for me playing World of Warcraft. I liked how this one has 3 interchangeable plates to fit any needs for any situation. It has the 12 buttons for popular MMORPG's 7 button layout for FPS or lighter button use MMORPG and the two button for everyday use. It's very easy to change each different side plate as you just pull it off no buttons or anything to hit. Its magnetically held on so its easy to pull off but stays on well and doesn't fall off during game play. It has software that * you can download that lets you control the RGB features along with profiles so you can easily custom set your button configuration for each game you play. As well as multiple users for those who share PC's with the family or friends.One thing I did not like was how large this mouse is. I have I guess a medium hand as I wear and fit medium gloves well. This mouse feels huge in my hand and has a different comfort to other mouses I"m used of using. I'm not used to my ring finger laying on the mouse as it's usually on the right side of the mouse. This has a slot on the mouse for your ring finger to rest on so it's like having three fingers on your mouse instead of the usual two (pointer and middle finger). This will take some time getting used to as it has for me. Instead of my ring finger and pinky being on the right side helping to grip the mouse and move it around it's now only my pinky finger which feels really weird for me still and I've been using the mouse for 3 or 4 days now.Edit 07/04/2020: *
5,I got this because I needed more easily accessible and usable buttons for MMORPG gaming (have you heard of the critically acclaimed MMORPG...). The ergonomics to some getting used to as the pinky rests next to your right click finger as opposed to groping the side of the mouse but I like it better now that I'm used to it.I love the swappable side plates let's you use the mouse for every activity. The 12 button configuration is surprisingly easy to use; I was worried I was going to fat finger the wrong buttons since I have large hands. I also like Razers software it makes it easy to configure the buttons and get exactly the lighting you want (I also have a Razer keyboard and the lighting flow seamlessly with the mouse).I haven't owned it long enough to say anything about durability but it does feel to be made of high quality parts though that's mostly conjecture. Overall it's exactly what I wanted and needed. Highly recommended if you're looking for a good all around mouse though if you don't need the gaming configurations you might be better served with a simpler mouse.
4,I've been using this mouse for about a month now. Coming from a 400-4000 DPI mouse this is a definite upgrade. The 5G optical sensor they threw into it is one of the fastest sensors on the market and the Ormond switches are top-of-the-line. But even that's not the best part about this mouse.The best part about it is the price. I know $100 is a bit much for a mouse. I get that. But when you consider exactly what you're getting for that $100 you're getting the best deal.We'll start with the standard 7 button mouse. The closest relative to this configuration is the DeathAdder Elite Chroma. The only differences between the Naga Trinity and the DeathAdder (replaceable button panels notwithstanding) are the texture under the two buttons on the panel and the fact that the Naga Trinity has a 'shelf' for your ring finger where the DeathAdder does not. The DeathAdder is $67.99.The 14 button configuration (this one has the 7 button MOBA panel) is most closely resembled by the Naga Hex V2. In fact it's a perfect representation of that particular mouse. The Naga Hex V2 is $44.99 refurbished and $74.49 new (and that's the least expensive option).In the 19 button configuration (this one has the 12 button MMO panel) is a perfect representation of the Naga Chroma MMO mouse. If you were to buy a new one this one would cost you at least $93.00.Add all those up and you get $235.98. But you're getting the functionality RGB Chroma Synapse (more on this later) for $100. Tell me again where you'll find another deal like that. Not to mention the fact that it's a really good smooth fast mouse with a different mechanic on the mouse wheel. It rocks left and right and it's set to scroll websites and documents without rolling the wheel. And of course you can program each individual button for individual tasks depending on the situation. They say you have to reboot your computer to change out the panels but that's simply not true. Synapse recognizes the changes on the fly and the mouse doesn't suffer any adverse effects. Pop one off put another one on. Simple.So... why the 4 stars? Synapse. This version (Synapse 3 beta) is something I hope they continue to work on. It's lost the intuitive feel previous versions have had. And no previous versions weren't perfect. In fact it would often stop loading profiles do strange things to the lights of the BlackWidow X Chroma then load a single color profile. Of course when that profile was no longer needed Synapse would reload the desktop profile and everything would be fine again. Synapse 3 made it harder for me to program an RGB profile for the keyboard. However I can set individual functions to individual buttons on the mouse. For instance the BlackWidow X Chroma doesn't have volume controls without using the FN key. I programmed those three functions to the mouse's 7 button panel. If Synapse gets better I'll change the rating. However until it does I'll just hold onto that star. I hope you're listening Razer. You claim to be 'by gamers for gamers'.
5,I've had variations on this type of mouse my whole life. Naga Hex 1 2 and then the dreaded Trinity. The Hex 1 and 2 lasted a very very long time then the paint started chipping and they were just old. The Trinity was garbage within 2 weeks.However this unlike the Trinity hasn't had a single issue! Definitely a worthy upgrade and considering that it's wireless it's fantastic.Pros: Good form factor more in-line with average sized hands. Scroll wheel is enjoyable. DPI step buttons are not easily pressed therefore not easily changed in the middle of things (which is good). Has both bluetooth and 2.4 very easy to switch modes and computers.Cons: 2.4 really is the best for latency but dear lord its range is bad. I would HIGHLY recommend getting the Razer Dock (it's also RGB so...) for two reasons:1. The 2.4 range is bad. The dock has a USB cable to extend it to your desk and allow you to place it in front of the mouse. You then place the 2.4 dongle in the dock. Connect the dock to the PC et voila. No more stutter or lag.2. Charging this is a pain without the dock. You have to remember to plug the mouse in and charge overnight (provided your mobo allows to charge with the PC off). BUT the dock has charging pins and you can just set the mouse on top and it will charge. Even breathes from Red>Orange>Yellow>Green for the charge level. Pretty nifty.Overall consider the cost of the dock to make this mouse more pleasant to use before you buy!(Oh and battery lasts for about 1.5 days if you never turn it off)
3,A wireless gaming mouse with interchangeable button layouts used in conjunction with the free Razer synapse software an incredible customization and remapping program is a gamers dream. This mouse is jam packed with features. The ability to choose from wired or wireless fully customisable RGB. Different magnetic button layouts (2-6-12). All in a wonderful feeling super responsive mouse. So why is it NOT perfect?To charge this much for a mouse you should expect perfection it's close but not quite. The bottom row of the 12 button layout does not function. The cord is squishy and frigial if in use it can easily kink and cause drag.To add to my nickpicky review of the Razer Naga pro Adding a toggle-able free spinning scroll wheel would make this mouse the only mouse you should ever consider buying. I hate that I should even have to go through a warranty process to fix such a nearly perfect product. Not only because any mouse in this price range should not exprience what I can only describe as "cut corners" during development But I don't want to have to go back to any other mouse just for the time being while it's gone.I do still highly recommend this product after all this feels nitpicking when you receive such an overall quality experience from a computer mouse.
5,Amazing product thank you
5,Old School Gamer since the Eighties.  I have owned Logitech Corsair and Redragon Gaming Mice.  This Razer Naga Pro is the best out of all the Mice I have owned.  After Programming this Mouse is very Responsive and a breeze to setup through Synapse 3.  Paired with a decent Mouse Pad my Scores in every game have gone up.  And I have only played with this Mouse less than 24 Hours.  The 3 pairs of Side Plates are perfect for the Variety of Games I play.  I almost bought the Razer Naga Trinity but read it had issues with the Mouse Left/Right button double clicking after a while.  Razer replaced those buttons with light beam-based actuation switches so I do not expect that issue on this Mouse.  They also upgraded to the Focus plus 20K DPI Optical Sensor.  Have not tried the 2.4 or Bluetooth Wireless yet since I like the Old School Security of a Wired Mouse.  Will update when I test out the Wireless.Updated July 09 2021:The 2.4 Wireless works Flawlessly.  Just remember to push the switch under the Mouse to 2.4.  Also the Side buttons stopped working in games but it was my fault for not Updating the Firmware to the new Version 2 Firmware on Razer's site.  Plus I had to uninstall Synapse 3 and all the other programs it had.  Reinstalled Synapse 3 and only the Macros Program and everything started working again.  I could care less about the LED lights.  Been Playing Games for almost 4 days straight without any issues.  Still a 5 Star Rating.  Still the Best Gaming Mouse I have ever owned.
5,So I've been using a Razer Naga variant for years. With the old version 6-12 months in the mouse would start double clicking.So far... This mouse feels just like the other Razer Naga's (I don't use the wireless functionality so can't speak to that) but hopefully the new switches fix the double clicking issue. Will update if that's not the case.
1,When I searched for "best gaming mouse" Razer was not on the top of list. I still decided to give this mouse a go because of Razer Keyboard and Mousepad I got. At first it seemed like a great mouse but I realized while playing apex that it would cause my computer to stutter. This was because it was manufactured with faulty driver issues. If you plug the mouse to the computer while also connecting it via bluetooth it pops up on your connection lists x2 causing issues with gameplay.The attachable sides will upset you especially when you want to pull out your shotty and instead find yourself shielding or healing yourself mid battle. You might think "oh this guy just pressed the wrong button." I also thought so too. I figured maybe the attachable side buttons were dirty or sticky and was just pressing down two buttons at once but that wasn't the case. The buttons were perfectly fine and clean. It would repeatedly mis-click and made gameplay quite annoying.The battery life lasts 2-3 days for an extreme gamer and seemed quite inconvenient to recharge as it would usually tell you you're at 15% mid-stream or mid-game rather than telling you to recharge at a more convenient battery life percentage.The main reason I'm writing this review is because out of all the mouses I've ever owned this is thee most expensive mouse I've ever purchased and it didn't even last 2 years. I purchased this mouse in February 2021 and in September 2022 it has completely stopped working. Sometime between me getting up to go use the bathroom and returning to my computer the mouse stopped lighting tracking and connecting to to the USB to charge. The mouse completely died and of course it will happen just beyond the reach of your warranty. I suggest going with a more durable reliable mouse brand such as Logitech.I have a basic Logitech mouse since 2006 that still works and that's what I'll have to use until I find a replacement. Upon reading other reviews online about the Razer Naga Pro I've learned that many people also regret purchasing this mouse. Thanks for scamming me Razer. Your products are cute and seemingly unreliable.
4,Bought the Naga Pro for $100ish on Prime Day.Its decent. So far it seems like a good mouse. I have both it and my Naga Trinity (also pictured - Trinity has the cord Pro is wireless) on the same computer right now to compare (the Pro is going on another computer that needed a wireless mouse).The new optical switches on left- and right-click don't feel quite as good and the side panel buttons seem a little more sensitive. Even being used to the ones on my Trinity I accidentally push the ones on the Naga Pro.If you have fat palms and want to either rest your hand on your mouse or use a claw grip you know you need a big mouse. I love the way these Nagas feel. I hate the way the pos generic mouse I have on my work computer feels after coming from one of these.(As a side note if you own a Trinity with the old mechanical Omron switches they're garbage Chinese Omrons you will eventually get the double click issue or they'll stop working entirely. Buy some of the Japanese Omrons and a new set of pads for it cause you'll ruin the old ones in disassembly and it'll fix it with a much better feel than either the original switches or the Pro's new optical switches.)
4,I love this Mouse. I play MMORPG's which is why I bought this mouse. I love having so many buttons to program and having all my spells or actions within thumb reach. My only complaint is that the #1 key is to easily clicked. I have a small hand and as I move the mouse around I find it really hard to not hit the #1 key. Other than that I most definitely recommend this mouse.
4,I play mostly MMOs and MOBAs. I've owned the Naga Trinity for about 6 months now. I also own a Logitech G600 so most of my review is mostly a comparison to that. For MMOs I actually prefer the G600; Cheaper feels better you know exactly what row of buttons you are on the way the button rows have alternating slants and raised ridges on the 5th and 8th button (G13/G16 buttons) and with G-shift you can multiply your 12-set of buttons to on the fly if you play a game that needs that many. But the Naga still can get the job done. What I like most about the Naga is the ability to change side panels super easy. Overall super nice for switching between different game genres. I especially like the hex side panel for MOBAs. For FPS games the 2-button panel feels standard but if thats all you play I would recommend a different mouse. I had the G600 for a long time (6+ years) so it took time to get use to the Naga.  If the 12-button panel had raised ridges it would be right up there with the G600 but because it doesn't I still sometimes accidentally press the wrong buttons at crucial times. Super feels bad. As for comfort the Naga does have a bigger feel so might be more comfortable with larger hands. Not a fan of the hard side buttons but some like that mechanical feel like a mechanical keyboard.tldr;For people who play MMOs strictly I recommend the G600. For people who play a variety of game genres I recommend the Naga Trinity.PROs:-Super convenient side panel switching-Chroma-High DPICONs:-Expensive-Good overall but not best in any specific game genre IMHO-Not a fan of the hard buttons-No ridges/slanted rows make each button feel identical-#1 button on 12-button panel sometimes is unresponsive. (Not sure if it's just my Naga specifically)
5,After 10+ years with my Razer Naga Hex (6-button thumb) I have finally decided to give it a rest since the LMB had been losing its strength to the point where it made gaming unplayable. Unfortunately the Naga Hex and the Naga Hex Version 2 were both discontinued long ago. I really liked my Naga Hex because of the ergonomics and the slick feel it had so I was torn on what mouse to get and this one the Trinity was recommended by a few friends. I wanted to keep the 6 button panel since I think anything more than that feels clunky big and obnoxious on the hand/thumb. The Razer Trinity was perfect because it comes with removal side button panels to suit your needs. Although it has taken me a few days to get use to the 7 panel which slightly changes my thumb placement to hit certain buttons the mouse is working like a charm. Highly recommended and will buy again if I ever have to (hopefully it'll last me 10 years like my previous one!)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The mouse constantly internally faults. Then has to restart. Be sure to get the warranty and cash in on a replacement. Register it with Razer too Amazon has not been helpful with letting me use the extended 4 year protection plan.
5,Best quality user interface mouse tracking wireless interfaces (especially the hiperspeed) charging capabilities and more.Just one annoying thing: Razer charges almost 50 dollars for a docking charging station which is a piece of plastic with metal connector USB port and some nice LED lights... so i bought a compatible docking station from Aliexpress for 10 dollars which looks and functions exactly the same.I use this mouse for gaming and for CAD designs and it's perfect for these tasks especially the swappable side panels.
4,They dropped one of the mouse4/mouse5 keys behind the mouse wheel so this is a deal breaker for me.  I use that 17th key ALL the time.  I would be happy if they just brought back the 2014 Razer Naga.  It was the best model ever but it can't be found any more.I don't care for swappable side plates either. Sometimes it randomly loses connection and the whole mouse stops responding.  It leads to in-game death.  The only way to fix is to remove the plate and re-attach it as quickly as possible and hope your in-game character survives during that time.  It's the same issue I had with the Trinity Naga.  Sometimes extra technology makes things worse not better!
3,Mouse is too small for larger hands. Hand starts to cramp after a few hours of continuous use.
5,Great product
5,This is an amazing mouse!  I like the hypershift option in razer synapse.
3,First and foremost it's a small mouse only 5 inches tip-to-tip—terrible for a palmer and I wear a L glove XL nitrile. The side buttons also are centered whereas thumbs articulate a little bit forward of halfway longitudinally for most people the result being that I have to claw my thumb so much that even not using most of the side buttons I aggravated tendonitis. Adults with long fingers will likely find it this mouse anyway unless they claw really scrunched.This mouse MIGHT be okay for kids and some adults with small hands. I suspect the position of the side buttons will be a smidge to retrograde for the majority of gamers.I also received refurbished when I intentionally tried to only buy new. It was here so I tried it out anyway which is how I came to learn about the physical issues for me. Unfortunately it stuttered slightly on occasion from the get go. See I prefer to move in World of Warcraft with the mouse which requires pushing the left and right mouse buttons simultaneously and continuously but occasionally it would for the briefest moment which is fine and dandy in most non-gaming environments but not for a player that pvps and raids. For a good month or so the stutter remained tolerable. However the last few weeks it started getting worse and the last week has been horrendous making the game almost unplayable in the fashion I prefer. To move around casually I can press the buttons hard; but that's only exacerbating my tendonitis and would for other people put them at greater risk of developing it.I'm a mac user NOT on the newest Synapse because I have an early BlackAdder keyboard which could be part of the problem. However actuation of the two primary buttons should never be a problem even under aging conditions. Generally profiles vs internet throughput for tired old software are the problem and/or sorry implementation of secondary features. My housemate who recently purchased a new (unused/unrefurbished) Naga Trinity has been disappointed with the performance of various buttons.So too many issues. Razer just isn't what it used to be needs to focus more on quality and durability rather than always rolling out new and several products. Sure a diverse selection of products is nice but if they all deserve only 4 stars max then the company is spreading itself too thin. And you know when every time you mention your mouse is acting up someone asks if it's a Naga by name the company has gone downhill.
5,This is more a review of the previous RAZER Naga. I bought my first one in 2012 and the right click just started giving out in 2022 making me purchase the new RAZER Naga X. These mice literally last an entire decade and have amazing performance all the way through its life. Buy it and you will never regret it. So far my new Naga X is just as high quality and has the same top level performance as before and I expect it to last another 10 years.
5,As someone who has owned a slew of Razer products over the years the Razer Naga has been always been a favorite of mine after I started playing WoW back in 2016.My first Naga lasted from then until probably half way through 2021 when I lost it in a move unfortunately. I went for the Naga X personally because I need it specifically for the 12 buttons and have heard about some quality issues with the interchangeable sides and I'm glad for it. The mouse feels the same as my older Naga Chroma has no DoubleClick and the cord feels nicer and more knit than the stiffer cord I had on the Chroma. I've had no tracking issues which I actually did have on both my Chroma and a Mamba TE that I owned which says to me that the sensor issues have gotten better. On top of all this Razer Synapse feels lighter and easier to work with as compared to back in the day (I've been using Synapse since 2013 thanks to my old Deathadder may it R.I.P.).
4,Loving it so far. Worked right out of the box but you have to download Razer Synapse if you want to program buttons which I expected. But I've noticed it stutter when playing which gets annoying when navigating in game menus or trying to click something. Took a start off otherwise it would've been 5 stars.
3,I like the features that this mouse offers. The extra side buttons are great and have a good tactile feel. My two biggest issues start with the mouse feeling extremely heavy. I am used to mice being lightweight but what I feel here is more a weight disbalance. It feels sluggish near the palm area and that just isn't a good fit for me. My second issue the sides curve out too much. My hands get sweaty and I noticed with the heavy nature of this mouse it is extremely hard to get a good grip. I think if the sides were more inward and even had a groove for your fingers it would possibly mitigate the weight issues.My only other gripe is that the side buttons on the normal mouse config (just back and front buttons) it incredibly hard to press but that is also because the shape curves out too much.
3,I'm not sure why it's so difficult to make an MMO type mouse for someone with large hands and big fingers.  I wear XXL gloves...The utility of the mouse is pretty clear from the different side panels and it works pretty seamlessly with one big exception.  The 12 button side panel while much better than the original Naga is set up in such a way that if you have a large thumb you're going to hit two buttons if you're not really careful.  On the original Naga the buttons were super hard to press.  This version only requires a light touch to click the button on any of the side panels which does make it somewhat easier to use...but the mouse is still too small and the buttons too tightly packed together on the 12 button panel.  The other panels are a little more workable but if you can only use two out of three effectively it kind of defeats the purpose of "Trinity".If the mouse was maybe 15-20% larger/longer (think the old Steel Series WoW Cataclysm mouse) and the buttons spaced just a little bit it would be about right for my hand.  It's definitely better than the original Naga in that regard but still not quite right.
5,I love the Naga models had a Naga 2012 and just replaced it i like the weight and the possibility to change the side panel to have more/less buttons is great to adapt from a MMORPG style game to what i need to work.
4,... that I'd be able to assign complex macros to each key... guess they weren't serious about gaming. That's my main beef... other than the keys...I'm always afraid to actually use it because one wrong key click can wipe the group
5,Replacement for my Corsair Scimitar that broke. The buttons are a little smaller so I was fighting muscle memory for a while and buttons 10-12 are a little hard to reach but the mouse over all is way more comfortable. I use it for FFXIV and not much else.
4,I love this mouse as a whole. The side buttons have become a must have for gaming. My only issue is that it’s a little large for my hand so I find myself accidentally hitting the side number pad accidentally.
3,An MMO mouse is essentially for any MMO player. Seriously these things are great and I can’t go back. I’ve owned 4 Nagas over 10 years now. Out of the 4 this one you can tell just isn’t as good as the more expensive models. My suggestion would be to grab the trinity or the pro at this point. That said if those are out of your budget this is still a good purchase.
4,This mouse is an absolute lifesaver and is excellent for any PC game that uses button mappings that are awkward to reach!When playing ESO the ability buttons were 1-5 (top row) but trying to accurately press those while moving (WASD) and dodge-rolling is an absolute nightmare. This mouse made it easy to play!I admit that it took me a while for my muscle memory to adapt to the new button locations (circle) but MAN was it worth it. Now I can effortlessly use my abilities and move my character at will without mistakes.If you notice in the pictures I added grip tape to the mouse for better handling as it’s too small and too smooth for me to handle while in an intense fight/situation.Cons:- If you have large hands like I do this mouse will feel wayy too small.- because of its shape and texture this mouse feels slippery at times and can be hard to handle when in an intense situation. This can cause you to make mistakes if your grip slips. I manually added grip tape to help with this.- it will take a while to develop muscle memory for the button panels. It has taken me about a month and some change and I’m getting more accurate each day.Pros:- THIS MOUSE WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.- The Naga makes complex gaming effortless and increases your reaction time because the buttons are in convenient easy-to-reach locations.- The side panels are hot swappable giving you plenty of variety and options.
1,I love gaming mice with the buttons on the side I pretty much can't imagine playing an MMO without one. My trusty Logitech G600 gave up the ghost earlier this year and so I started looking for a replacement. I was surprised to see that (at the time) Logitech had discontinued the G600 or had plans to do so. Baffling to me as it's by far the best gaming mouse I had EVER owned. As a result I began looking for an alternative something ergonomic with the trusty buttons on the side that I had come to rely on. I saw this one from Razer and thought "OK Razer is a well-known brand it looks good let's try it". Definitely way more expensive than I would have liked (the G600 is about $40) but again I assumed I was investing in a solid product. I did see the negative reviews on Amazon about the mis-clicks and double clicks and sticking buttons but very stupidly thought that it wouldn't happen to me.The mouse looks and feels really good! And it's wireless which I didn't mind I love my desk to be as clean and wire-free as possible. I got the mouse in July and by October I noticed that I would use my mouse to do quick turns and it just...wouldn't respond or would respond late resulting in erratic movement. I was in danger of dying in game several times because my character wasn't moving the way I was telling them to. I'd bound all my healing spells to the side buttons and people were dying because I was pressing buttons that were not responding at all. More and more I noticed choppy and laggy responsiveness from the mouse even at full charge and after being cleaned. I did not feel that this was acceptable especially considering the cost of this mouse and how long I had owned and been using it. 3-4 months is NOT the normal usable lifespan of a mouse.Here's the fun part. Don't bother buying this and then trying to get your money back. Just don't buy it at all and save yourself the bother of it all. I contacted Amazon who then put me in touch with Razer to sort out how to fix this. I do NOT want a replacement of this garbage mouse I've already ordered a G600 which is (happily) back up for sale but Razer will NOT offer you a refund on this thing because apparently purchasing this through Amazon means you forgo that right. They will ONLY offer to send you a new mouse. A new mouse that will assuredly crap out in 3-4 months and you're back where you began. So I'm $150 in the hole with this thing and there is nothing else I can do except leave this review. Save yourself the hassle and just look elsewhere. This thing is an expensive paperweight.Edit: The final verdict from Razer on this after days of back-and-forth and requests from them (I had to sit in my game with recording software running waiting for the mouse to mess up for them to see) was that since more than14 days had passed since my purchase AND since I had bought the mouse from a "third party seller" all they would do is send me a new mouse. Imagine that a gaming company that won't stand by their product after 14 days. I got back in touch with Amazon CS and explained the situation. Even though I was past the 3-month returns window they graciously have allowed me to return the mouse to them so that I can get my money back on this trash. I'll never buy a Razer product again.
5,Extremely comfortable
5,I don't currently own a desk so my set up is my tv and everything needed to be wireless/wired combo for the future. This mouse is pretty decent i like that i can switch to controls on the side depending on what im going to use it for and the battery life is good. That being said im not a heavy gamer but have gotten at least 3½ days of heavy usage or a week an a half (prob more) of light use before having to plug up for a recharge. Occasionally there will be a delay in tracking (when in BT mode) which if you're a heavy gamer you might not want i have not experienced that issue much when its directly connected but i hardly use the wired connection.
2,I've tried many MMO mouses before I ordered this one. When I saw this mouse from what I read the Trinity wasn't great at lasting very long (Double Click Issue) mainly. So when I saw the Naga X had "2ND-Gen Optical Switches" I took a risk and ordered the Naga X knowing some of the good features from Trinity were gone. (Tilt-Wheel) (Two DPI buttons) (Rubber Side Grip) (LED Logo) (Interchangeable Side Plates) while I wasn't happy these features were gone.I thought to myself I could live without these features cause maybe the Optical Switches would give the Naga X a longer life span plus the weight decrease and "SpeedFlex-Cable" with the upgraded sensor was some very nice features comparing to other MMO mouses I've tried. In my opinion this is where the good features stop. Based on my experience I'm going to tell you why you should reconsider ordering this mouse.I had this mouse for around three months before and had to RMA because of the (Double Click Issue).  The new features are good (SpeedFlex Cable) (Decrease Weight) (New Sensor) (New Switches) Razer removed/changed features that in my opinion ruined what could've been a great mouse.Now is this mouse worth $80? to me? nope I'm going to tell you why. First let's talk about the (Tilt-Wheel) which is an amazing quality of life improvement while it's on the Naga Trinity it's not on the Naga X and it's not far off from Naga Trinity Price. I saw some reviews that had the (Double Click Issue) within a week of owning the Naga X mine happened around three months of owning it. The Plastic Side Grip is just awful. The only way to improve that is to use some Mouse Grip Tape. Removing the LED light made no sense to me. Why is there only one DPI button?? I haven't seen a mouse company do that in a while. The (Side Buttons) while the switches themselves feel good. But to me it feels like the buttons have no texture on them so they feel kinda cheap. The coating on the mouse is okay. I wish they would've improved upon the Interchangeable Side Plates instead of just removing the feature.Razer Synapse has flaws just like G HUB. Honestly Razer Support Team is a hit or miss. (Been around a month) and still haven't got a replacement.Overall Thoughts: While the new features are good they just removed too many that not only made their mouse stand out before. But also removing quality of life features. This mouse is just not worth $80 to me. I'm going to write a Pros and Cons list below.ProsSpeed-Flex cableReduced WeightOptical SwitchesSensor has upgradedConsFeels CheapPlastic Side GripOptical Switches ( I got the double-click issue after three months)Tilt-Scroll Wheel removedRazer LED Logo removed ( Doesn't bother me to much)Side Buttons in my opinion feel cheap but the switches feel goodOnly one DPI Button instead of TwoNo Interchangeable Side PlatesOnce again if you like this mouse awesome! I'm just sharing my thoughts and my experience with this mouse.
3,I love this mouse with just the 2 buttons on the thumb it feels great it moves well I feel I've gotten better at pointing and blowing up bad guys with this mouse. HOWEVER the 7 button panel and the 12 button panel are not laid out well. the mouse is only a little bit lighter than my steel series rival 500 but it seems to be much easier to push around on my mouse pad (Just a generic cloth pad)The 7 button panel is laid out in a circle with a spot for your thumb in the middle. The spot in the middle can get a bit sweaty as your thumb rests on the rubberized spot which is shaped like the top of a hill so you don't really have anything to tuck your thumb into when you lift up the mouse. The buttons are reasonably sized but a bit small and close together you really gotta pay attention to what buttons you are wanting to hit. My Rival 500 has larger thumb buttons that are spaced out in a way that makes it hard to hit the wrong button. Minor beef the buttons are laid out in a circle so that the 1 button is in the 9 o clock position (Roughly) and the 7 button is next to it below it which gives me some weird left brain / right brain issues when trying to press the button I know I need to press as my muscle memory hasn't quite caught up to this button panel yet.the 12 button panel is uh... a bit overwhelming the buttons are close together and would probably take a bit more time to get familiar / comfortable with. Also there's no spot to grab the side of the mouse with your thumb. The buttons DO require a bit more pressure to press and you can easily pick up the mouse with your thumb without pressing the buttons when you're being mindful of how you are holding the mouse but it could stand to have the layout changed a lot. I think I'd rather have some kind of foot pedal buttons or something.All the thumb button panels feel great to press you know you've pressed them when you manage to find the one you want. People complain about the cheap build quality of Razer stuff but this mouse feels great and solid after a month or so hopefully it will still feel great later on. It's a shame the 2 button panel is the best configuration of this mouse.
5,Very happy with the comfort and grip of this mouse.  I had a top of the line Logitech G502 and while I liked the features it was just a little too big for my medium to smallish hand and didn't line up well with the claw style grip that I use.  The Razer is surprisingly comfortable for me despite it being a relatively large mouse.  The key for me is the hump on the back which is perfect for resting just a bit of my palm to achieve the claw grip.In addition to the excellent comfort the interchangeable side panels are really nice and work well.  Super easy to snap them on and off.Be aware that the mouse is on the heavier side but if you are ok with this don't mind wired and have small to medium hands with claw grip this mouse is a winner.
4,if you have Windows it's a really good mouse but for mac users they don't have software to config the mouse so I have to return it.
3,I bought this mouse back in 2019 and let me tell you it was absolutely wonderful! I love the exchangeable plates the DPI and the programmable lights. A few things I would note is that if you have smaller hands (I’m a woman so my hands are on the smaller side) the mouse will be a little difficult to grab on to. I notice that after sweating a little I start to lose grip but it’s not enough to deter me or make me leave a bad review. The plates are an absolute dream! If I want 7 buttons there’s a plate. If I want 12 there’s a plate. It’s convenient and easy to switch them out. Not only do I use my mouse to game and for personal use I also use it for work and I find myself being more productive.So now let’s fast forward to current day March 2021. I noticed a week ago that when I was moving a window to the left the mouse “let go” of it. I had to keep dragging and re-dragging until I got it to where I wanted. I would try to select batches of files to move and all of them would be de-selected and then one out of the entire batch would open. At first I thought it was a problem with my computer (since I have to use virtual machines for work) so I restarted the laptop and virtual machine and I noticed the same issue! I let it go until I started to notice it hindering my gaming!! I would try to hold down the left click to shoot an arrow in one of my games and the mouse “let go”! Not only did it unclick it would then start spamming arrows until I completely took my finger off the button. It’s been so irritating that I now have to look around for a new mouse.The mouse has lasted me about 2 years but after seeing so many reviews of people having similar issues as mine in as little as a few months is slightly deterring. I’m torn over getting another Naga or just getting a different brand overall.
5,I used to own alot of Razer products before I switched over to logitech mice for ergonomic reasons. They always performed well and lasted for a long time and the Naga is no exception to this. I bought this for my GF so she can play MMOs. Easily programmable with their Synapse software it fits well with her hand shape and size and of course it glides well across her deskmat. Would recommend
1,I loved my old Naga (wired) but for whatever reason Razer is having a very hard time making a wireless mouse that works. I get so angry when I'm right in the middle of some sort of fight and all of a sudden... disconnect... sorry you lose. I'd say it disconnects about once every 3-4 minutes for about 2-10 seconds.The interchangeable plates are interesting and I thought I'd use them a lot but the reality is I put the six-button faceplate on and haven't changed it since. What's worse is that faceplate isn't that great since the buttons are somehow always in the almost-but-not-quite correct spot. Consequently I'm constantly pushing the wrong button. It's gotten to the point where I tend to use the keyboard rather than the mouse buttons.The Synapse software updates every time I turn the computer on or at least it seems that way. I don't mean it checks for updates it literally updates. And every update seems to break something that used to work (what happened to my automatic profile use Razer?). This isn't an deal breaker but it is annoying.Battery life is good as long as you turn it off when you're not using it otherwise with no use it'll last 4 days or so.The coloring is kind of cool since I have a Razer wireless keyboard too. The colors stay in sync and it's pretty and makes it really easy to play games in the dark.One thing I will say: this mouse can take a beating. I've thrown then thing across the room more times than I can count and it's survived every time. I kind of keep hoping it breaks one of these times so that I can buy a new mouse that doesn't have these disconnect problems but so far no luck.
4,The only arguement for me against this mouse is the sensitivity of the buttons on the 12 button pad I sometimes find myself accidentally hitting these with very little pressure but other than that it’s perfect!
5,I now have 4 of these have never had an issue with any of them.  I frequently use them on secondary screens where i have to mouse around and do macro key stokes.
3,I have been a long time user of the predecessor to this device the Naga Chroma Epic.  This feels the same but is lighter and the LEDs are nice and bright.  The modular panels seem nice but we'll see how they hold up as I have heard complaints about the Naga Trinity side panel buttons acting up.  Battery life is great but not amazingly better than my old Razer Naga.  The mouse is smooth and tracks accurately but don't expect gaming level performance on BT and expect to use the 2.4Ghz receiver.  Ergonomics could use a serious update but I am used to the old one so it wasn't hard to slip into using this one and the form factor and button positions are near identical.  But I had to seriously knock two stars off of what could have been a 5 star review if they had bothered to provide the mouse dock.  At $140 USD to not provide a dock to easily charge the mouse is absolutely ridiculous and a cheap very very cheap move on Razer's part to make more money.  Yes I know it didn't come with it when I bought it but I still feel this is a compelling point that may affect some users' decision to buy or not.  The cradle/charging system worked just fine on the Chroma Epic so why fix what's not broken?  Just so you can charge $50 for a $10 charger???  Seriously.  I bought a knock off aftermarket charging dock for $20 because after this I feel like Razer doesn't really care and just wants my money.
5,I have been using this mouse for over a year now It's very easy to clean(important to keep dust out of sensors on removable side panel) fits in my hand well love the the on the fly sensitivity buttons what i love the most though is the MOBA SIDE WHEEL ATTACHMENT. it's very simple an makes it easy to play pc games as that's more functionality with the mouse without having too many buttons all the while being able to easily reach every button with my thumb without shaking the mouse. highly recommend to anyone getting into PC gaming. I should also note the side panels are sold separately on razers site if something happens to one of them.
5,I bought this mouse few weeks ago and it worked perfectly fine minus the fact it didn't Charge but Amazon Picked it right back up and refunded me everything within 2 weeks and shipped me another one. Works 100% perfectly and is the best mouse ever made.The only negative I have is that the side buttons on the MMO mode are a little sensitive and easy to accidentally click but you just have to adapt to it and one work around I found was just unbinding the # 4 button so i can claw grip that button and not worry about misclicks.Even with that issue it's still 5/5 but before me unbinding #4 it was a 4.75 / 5Overall 5/5 Best mouse ever created and amazon refunded my other faulty naga pro that didn't charge.
2,Purchased this mouse in march of 2021 and have been very light with it. Hardly even right click I use the left click sk much more often since i okay a lot of RPGs and action games that require very little use of the right mouse button. Well suddenly the day before i am writing this I wake up and get on my pc to okay spiderman remastered and the right click isn't working. You have to mash it deep inside. Tried contacting Razer support. They gave me the run around even though they said it sounds like the product is defective. I would really like to just replace my mouse instead of spending two to four weeks arguing with Razer customer support over whether they should replace it. Especially since I am in between jobs right now and am very very ILL with some form of gastrointestinal disease I can't afford to pay for shipping both to Razer and from Razer the is absurd. I just with I could talk to amazon and have them replace it.
5,I've never written a review but this is an issue that drove me nuts for years as I'm sure it has others. I've been using the Naga Trinity after upgrading from a regular Naga for years and have always had a problem with them after a few months where it will double click when I single click or when I am trying to click and drag something it will unclick etc. Seeing the marketing for these new switches immediately had me sold and I am telling you it's the best investment I've made in awhile for someone who is constantly using their mouse.The mouse feels a little cheap at first because of how light it is compared to the Trinity but after some use I have actually grown to love the lighter feel of it way more. The clicks are super crisp and they do feel very nice and precise. One thing I did not know until I received this mouse is that it does NOT have the left and right mouse wheel keys. The mouse wheel is a normal mouse wheel with click and scroll only which I think is a good change because I have also had scroll wheel issues in the past and I believe this mouse will not have them.TL;DR If you're considering this mouse because of any problems your current mouse is having just buy this and don't think about it you will not regret it.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 After owning this mouse for only about 9 months a glitch started occurring where it would sometimes randomly double click when I wanted to only single click.  As a gamer this is an extremely obstructive glitch that can be the difference between winning and losing a match in MOBA's.  At first it did not occur very frequently and I felt I could deal with it because the mouse was still relatively young and expensive.  But as time went on it became worse and worse.  After about a month the frequency occurred so often I would actually more often double click instead of single click.  Furthermore I could no longer drag and drop as it would instead just double click (can't organize inventory and end up consuming items that you simply want to move...)Eventually I said enough is enough and I contacted Razer Customer Support.  The representative I spoke with was named Elena and she was a lovely person who was very polite and helpful however the protocol that the company made her follow was horrendous.  I first had to PROVE to them that my mouse was actually defective which to me is unheard of.  I had to record a video showing that the mouse was indeed double clicking whenever I single clicked and I will attach that video to this review just so people can see how ridiculous it is.After providing proof that I wasn't a liar that was trying to scam them they then instructed me to blow under the mouse button with compressed air.  I happen to own a can of compressed air specifically because it was the first suggestion that came up when I googled how to fix a double clicking issue.  Needless to say it didn't work but the fact that they expected me to own a can of compressed air is ridiculous and I would be concerned if another customer would be put on hold until they bought a can of compressed air.They then instructed me to ensure that it was not connected to a HUB (it wasn't) re-install Razer Synapse and all of my mouse drivers (which requires a system reboot) and after all that didn't work they finally admitted that it was a hardware problem and agreed to send a replacement.  Elena told me that I will be contacted by the Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) team and they would assist me further.  I was thinking okay that was a bit of a hassle but at least I'm getting my replacement.I gave Elena my shipping address on Sunday 3/21/21 and got radio silence for a few days.  On Wednesday 3/24/21 Elena contacted me back thanking me for providing the shipping address (so it wasn't passed to RMA yet?) and told me that RMA would contact me in 24-48 hours.  Finally on Thursday 3/25/21 RMA contacted me only to vastly disappoint me.  They emailed me a return label and expected me to print it out and slap it onto the original packaging or a new box and send it back to them.I was completely blown away.  Never have I ever had to do such a tedious process for returning a product.  Standard protocol usually calls for the company to send me a replacement FIRST and alongside it a box with the return label already attached which I can easily throw the defective mouse in and slip in a mail box at the post office.  If I don't send the defective one back then they charge me for the new one.  This is how every replacement item I have ever gotten has ever been handled.The fact that they want me to print out the return label for them go and find a suitable box to ship it back in (I threw away the original box) and then wait however long it takes for it to reach them and once it finally reaches them THEN they can begin the process of shipping me a new one which will take an additional 5-7 business days.  So then what I'm stuck without a mouse for 2 weeks???  First of all what kind of millennial gamer even owns a printer in their household in this day and age?  Do they expect me to go to a print shop during this pandemic???  And to top it all off the fact that I have to go 2 weeks or maybe even more without a mouse since COVID has been causing a lot of shipping delays...this is absolutely unacceptable.What a long and tedious hassle just to try and get a replacement for a $100.  Needless to say I won't be doing this ridiculous process for returning the mouse and will be shopping for a new one.  The mouse itself was fine until it broke but this customer service experience has convinced me to never buy a Razer product again in my entire life.
4,This mouse has great versatility with the provided left side button attachments to use for various game genres and productivity.Function/Build:I have had no tracking or clicking issues.  The side buttons snap securely into place via front and rear strong magnets.  Keep in mind that while you have no side button attachment connected it basically "turns off" your mouse.  That said it's very nearly instant when hot swapping attachments.  I have swapped attachments mid-game a number of times when I realized I forgot to do it before-hand without issue.Versatility:I've become very accustomed to the 12 button attachment for MMO use but the two button attachment for shooters.  I haven't used the 3rd attachment at all.  I will say this is quite a heavy mouse and I've grown to appreciate a much lighter mouse for shooters so keep that in mind if you plan to get this mouse primarily for use with shooters and only occasionally other genres.Software:It works well and very straight forward for customizing macros RGB leds DPI among other settings.  I have not noticed any resource hogging by the software either.Longevity:This is where Razer mice have been very lacking for myself and many others historically.  While the mouse works well now I'm only giving it 4 stars given the track record I have had with Razer mice dying in one way or another (i.e. mouse click sensor failure track laser failure etc) after warranty expiration.Overall I only give the mouse 4 stars because of my uncertainty with the longevity given my past experiences with Razer brand mice.
4,IVe had this mouse for almost 3 years i play on average 40-70hrs of video games a week mainly Shooters. The mouse has been wonderful i use the 12keypad side on it for all games it helps alot so i can keep my fingers on WASD and use the keypad to lean use gadgets etc. overall its been one of my favorite mice ive ever owned now after 3 years the right click has started to have problems and if you hold for aiming etc it'll act like your clicking it. Would recommend the mouse to anyone if it can withstand 40+hrs a week of intense gaming for 3years a normal user itll last forever.
5,After using this mouse for several months I can say that it's definitely worth the value.I only have two complaints:- There is no on-board memory profile for the RGB. You NEED the Razer program running if you want ANY control of the RGB; without it the RGB will only do a slow colour spectrum cycle.(Don't worry though on-board profile DOES exist for any mapped key input changes/macros - You don't need the program running to save THOSE changes)- The 11 and 12 buttons feel too flush against each other. Every button has nice variations in their ridges to easily differentiate them via thumb touch but the 11 and 12 keys kinda blend together and can easily feel like a single button.
3,This is a good mouse for leisurely MMOing. The numerical buttons closest to the bottom on the 12key plate miss kepresses fairly often. The 2.4ghz signal competes with other peripherals or wifi router and while I can change the channel in my router I can't even find documentation on the frequencies or channels this mouse uses let alone tailor it. I love these 12 button mice for productivity as well and this is the only wireless one on the market. I don't see any need for the other 2 plates and I'd rather just have a securely connected one that won't miss presses. The synapse software has conflicts with local and online profile syncing. Bluetooth works good and I use this setup with a single dongle for both keyboard and mouse on multiple devices. It switches over seamlessly. Razer did very well with this mouse and the options are great. Battery life is good. Feels a little flimsy and no weight control. They need to dial in the stuttering and missed keys make it a burlier single unit and it would be perfect.
5,I love this mouse I Have too many wires so it being wireless is a plus I do wish it was a bit smaller but I love how you can change the side as needed
4,I bought this mouse hoping it would stop me from using multiple mice for different games. The mouse worked great functionally and with gaming however it’s not as big as my Logitech g600 for MMOs and my Steelseries Rival 600 for FPS. I have large hands and palm grip so it’s hard to find something that feels right. I ended up returning thisbut for anyone that doesn’t have large hands and palm grip it should work great.
5,I have been using the (original) Razer Naga for over 10 years. I have purchased 2 for personal use and one for my office.The original mouse was great for both MMO style gaming as well as work in AutoCAD and other button intensive programs. I always used the wired version and after years of abuse the mice were in need of replacement. Unfortunately the original 12 button version was discontinued a few years ago.Until NOW!! I was thrilled to find that the Naga Pro was being released. The form factor is far more comfortable in comparison to the previous versions. I also love the fact that the side plate can be easily switched (magnetically held in place) when using the mouse for different tasks or games. While the 12buttons are great in some situations it's nice to have the option to switch to 6 or 2.The new (to me) software and macro creation is simple and profile switching is a breeze. You can also customize the lighting colors to your liking or just let it cycle through them all. I'm hoping to purchase a matching keyboard to further customize the lighting across my desk.Overall I'm very impressed with this mouse and would highly recommend it to anyone considering buying.
3,First of all let me say I LOVE this mouse. I have used Razer products for years and while they're working there's nothing better.  That said I'm on my 4th or 5th mouse (my current Naga Trinity is my 3rd of this model) and they just DO NOT LAST. I use the Razer Ultimate Black Widow keyboard and I'm on my 3rd one of those for the same reason - I am convinced that Razer makes their products with planned obsolescence meaning they intend for them to stop working so you'll buy more. Also I'm on my 2nd Razer Man O'War headset. Kudos Razer your plan has worked on me thus far. But I digress... back to the mouse... absolutely fantastic for a while. I've had 3 different models of their mice and they all stop working after a year or so. Now I'm in the market for another mouse and I want one with the 12 button matrix on the side like this one has because my current Naga Trinity's side buttons stop working OFTEN. I can temporarily "fix" it by removing the side panel (because they give you 3 side button configuration options) and putting it back on. Sometimes I have to do this 5-10 times to get the 1-12 buttons on the side actually output what they are supposed to. Then they randomly just stop working in the middle of a game - maybe 5 minutes after I "fix" it maybe 2 hours later who knows? I am finally fed up. Razer you have lost a committed (obviously) customer.TL;DR: mouse is great but it breaks. Trust me I'm on my 5th one. It's fantastic for about a year. Then like all Razer products it stops working. 5 stars while it's working but 3 stars for the planned obsolescence.
5,I was using 5$ mice my whole PC life (about 10 years of gaming) they were the only thing that seemed reasonable after all the controllers I went through on consoles. But I'll tell you spending that little bit extra really improved not only my skill but the quality of life this baby gives is amazing. While most of my friends are learning what buttons do what and managing all of that I just make a profile rebind things to my nice 12 side buttons and just like that I any new game I play is easily conquered with a little patience of course!I should note under the time i've thrown onto this bad boy. It still looks brand new. about 12 hours of gaming 7 days a week. A lot of mmo's and click intensive games.10/10 will buy again (if I have to)
1,UPDATE:  VIDEO IS 5th mouse with similar issue in a year.  My replacement mouse took nearly a month to get to me after the process of talking with customer support (who only responds once a day in the morning it seems) arranging to ship out the broken mouse waiting for them to receive it waiting for them to ship it from their warehouse to them apparently waiting for them to ship a new one to me and finally me receiving it.  Well the short of it is  THE REPLACEMENT MOUSE IS DEFECTIVE.  It again has a loose right mouse button that makes it unusable in any situation where you need to be able to rely on a mouse button actually clicking and only once when you click it.  Forget gaming with a mouse with a half broken mouse button.  The reason we buy gaming mice is to be able to rely on them in high pressure situations not to call out to our team "Sorry team my mouse messed up again."  See 2nd video for what I'm talking about.  I CANNOT AND DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOUSE due to lack of quality control having received 1 mouse that failed within a year and 4 mice that were broken on arrival.Let me start by saying I love this mouse - when it works and is of acceptable and intended quality.  Mouse 1:  The first mouse I ordered had a loose left button meaning it had play in it before it touched the click switch.  This makes for a soggy and unreliable button feel and for a "gaming mouse" this can't and won't work.  I returned this mouse for a replacement.  Mouse 2:  The replacement mouse had buttons that were tight as expected.  Feedback was great and mouse was a joy to use... for only 8 months.  Then the right and left click buttons both started to fail.  They wouldn't register clicks sometimes and other times they would register double clicks.  On numerous occassions this caused me to lose control of my character or use an expensive item I didn't intend to.  Unacceptable.  Started a return process (which I am still in the middle of) to get this mouse replaced.  Mouse 3: In the meantime while I wait for support to figure their stuff out (been over a week communicating with them and the only advanced RMA they offer is to pay for the replacement mouse first to then be refunded later (not acceptable to me) I purchased a brand new mouse from Amazon.  When the replacement is fixed I will have 2 one to travel with.  The third mouse had a loose right click.  Again this isn't a nit picky thing this affects gameplay and makes the mouse very hard to use reliably without using the force of Thor to make sure it clicks properly and only once.  I replaced Mouse 3.  Mouse 4:  LOOSE LEFT CLICK.  Same issue.  QUALITY CONTROL HELLO?  For a gaming mouse you'd think they may take a bit more time making sure oh I dont know THE MOUSE BUTTONS ARE SOLID.  I will have to return this mouse as well.**ALL IN ALL - in 8 months 4 mice have failed or arrived with broken soggy buttons.  If that doesn't scare you then go ahead it's a great mouse when you don't get a broken or half dead one right out of the box.**Razer if you're listening I've supported and used Razer peripherals since the Lachesis mouse and always owned and only owned Razer.  I don't think I can afford the time and effort it takes to manage to get a properly quality controlled device anymore.  Not happy.
4,my first week with this mouse was a nightmare some of the side buttons were not registering clicks I kept getting low battery indicators the software kept shutting down...do you know what fixed all of this?TURN OFF THE LED LIGHTS!!!! just disable the lights on the mouse that's all I had to do and I have not had a single issue in over a month of use.  Great battery life.  The software isn't the best and I would still like a lighter wireless MMO mouse on the market but until that comes out this is your best option.Logitech if you're listening the ball is in your court I used the g600 before this but if you could make the g600 lighter and wireless that would be great thanks
5,legit i prefer this one over the trinity. If you got fat fingers like I do this mouse will handle the pressure for a very long time. My last one maybe lasted about a year or so.Side note : if you're mashing down hard or your signal is just not getting there time to get a new one and don't wait! If you hurry its like next day with prime I think.
4,Regarding the precision and the software I have nothing to declare this is definitely top notch. You can even assign functions to the mouse buttons. Regarding the mouse ergonomics and quality overall it's certainly not as premium & practical as the price tag claims it is. I feel clumsy with it and even after using it for three weeks it does not feel as right as my previous MX Master 2S. I am not even mentioning the scroll button that goes off all too often. Regarding the mouse materials after only three weeks of use the paint on the 7-button mouse extension is already going off even though I did nothing to make this happen (it did not fall I did not play with chemicals around it and it was not exposed to sunlight). So just to summarize the mouse is good in terms of precision and in terms of software functions but in terms of materials and ergonomics it's rather cheap.
3,Is a good mouse and I like razer productsI bought this mouse to replace my Logitech g600 mmo mouse with a wireless mmo mouse.The customization with this wireless mouse is great. I tried using g the 6 button side piece first but felt I had to bring my thumb in too far to hit the last 2 buttons closest to me.So I put on the traditional full button piece on. That was working better for me until I noticed I was accidentally hitting the side buttons when I went to slightly lift the mouse to move it. The buttons took up too much real estate on the side and I was pushing the buttons with my thumb when picking up the mouse to move it.I ended up plugging my g600 back in and I was glad I didn't buy the mouse charger for it yet.The mouse was also a little bit bigger than what I'm used too it was comfortable but I wouldn't want to game with it.
2,I just bought it for a few days yet I've already encountered many problems listed below:1. The light color on the 12-button panel may not be changed properly because of some invisible dusts on the connecting surface. Whether the mouse can last long would be questionable when the side panel is so sensitive.2. The ergonomic design makes you can only rely on your thumb and little finger to lift the mouse.3. I bought Naga Pro solely because of the side buttons but it doesn't work as I expected as those extra side buttons can only be mapped to existing keys macros or shortcuts rather than work as mouse button 6/7/8/9/etc. which means to make really use of these buttons you have to either drastically change your key mapping in games or switching between games and Razer Central back and forth to assign keys for side buttons for each game.4. No mouse case is given or can be purchased as a set yet it is hard to find a case designed to store the mouse and all accessories properly.
5,I have had excellent luck with Razer Products. They seem always to be thought through carefully and constructed for long continuous usage. The Trinity is a perfect example of Razer's careful design. There are times when I need a gaming mouse. Sometimes I need a simple mouse for working a Word Access or Xcel document. This mouse is quickly changeable for different functions. The interchangeable side plates attach with magnets and stay put during many a accidental drop to a rug. I also insist on a wired mouse. I have nothing major against battery companies but I see no personal reason to keep them in business. I have had too many radios flashlights and photo equipment that have died murdered by leaky batteries. No wired accessory to my computers has ever stopped working if I cared for it properly. My one criticism isn't much of one on that I am old and arthritic. When I have the 12 button plate attached I find it difficult to easily reach all the buttons. My advice is don't get old and arthritic. Old is better than the alternative but arthritic ain't no picnic. Otherwise this is as good as it gets in a mouse.
5,I love Razor devices. I used to have a wireless Razor Naga but I must have misplaced it. This mouse is essentially 3x better than that mouse though it doesn’t have the wireless feature that my old one had. The only problem that I have with the mouse is the size. It is quite big compared to other mice. I suggest using either the 8-button panel or the 2-button panel since those have a grip for the thumb. The 12-button panel has a chance of you pressing a button if you grip the mouse too hard to move it. As for the dpi I don’t know what you would use the full amount for but good luck if you do. On max I barely move my mouse and the pointer goes from one side of the screen to the other. I usually use default windows mouse settings and 700-800 dpi on razor settings. When plugging the mouse in it should try to install the software which is nice since you won’t need to find it online. The mouse will also save its settings for a couple profiles so if you move the mouse to a new pc the settings will carry over.
5,By far the best mouse I have ever owned/used. Steep price tag but well worth every penny. The size of the naga pro is perfect fits in your hand perfectly. The 12 button panel is perfectly positioned even the 101112 buttons are easy to hit using the back part of your thumb at the bend. The swappable panels switch in and out very clean and the panels fit perfectly and never feel awkward. Little to no delay in response being wireless is nice as well. The razer synapse is easy to use and customizes the mouse to any way you would like to have the colors the DPI etc. the shelf for your ring finger is very comfortable and a nice feature for ergonomics. Can NOT a downside to this mouse yet. The double clicking problem that some people have incurred has not happened to me I assume that is just a problem that some might get and need to return to get a new mouse but not a large number of mice have this problem. Just a few here and there like everything else. For heavy MMO gamers this is an absolute must have. It will change your gaming life forever
5,Gave this to my husband as his Logitech(highend) mouse had issues with double clicking and here we are 6 months in using the Razer NagaPro and it's just perfect for his games! I used it to and it is so fast and comfortable to use. Definitely one for the books!PS: i had a hard time choosing between logitech and razer. Good thing I chose this for his gift! He loves it!
5,I mainly wanted a high quality mouse that worked well with by linux machines.  For a while many gaming mice that once worked were misbehaving and I fell back on the cheapest mice possible.  This mouse works beautifully in Linux.  I haven't tried it for Linux gaming yet to be honest so I can't speak to any possible issues there.  I do notice it can be a little high strung in that small hand/finger movements can give results that weren't always expected.
3,Mouse performs well but sometimes I have to reset the blue tooth connection to get it to work properly... My other razor Bluetooth mouse (death Adler) didn't have this issue
1,TLDR; Nice product though it is prone to issues 3.5-4 stars company though is honestly 1 star or lower I was a big fan of this company until this miserable fiasco. Will most likely never purchase from Razer again as a result.The product: Honestly super nice the interchangeable side are super useful for people like me who like to be able to a lot very quickly and use different styles for different games. The software could use a bit of refining as it has reset on me more than once and I had to set up the programs all again. It looks clean and the feel is nice. DOWNSIDE: It has several historical problems my mouse started double clicking with the right mouse button about 4 months after purchase and gradually at about 6 months it became practically unusable for so much as traversing amazon. I reverted to using a older mouse that I had retired and tried to place a ticket with Razer's customer service which is when things went downhill.Customer Service Experience: Never have I lost more faith in a company before so quickly. After about 2 weeks of emailing with them I got the OK to send in my product to be either refurbished or replaced based on their judgement I sent in the product and forwarded the tracking number and other pertinent information. I got no email in reply. A few days later I did get a reply however it was another template email saying I haven't shipped my mouse yet and my case will be terminated if I do not I responded saying I have and again provided the tracking number. With the tracking number I saw my product arrived at their facility and was signed for. So I waited a day or two emailed them asking for a progress update and got the same reply of "We have not seen your package shipped yet". This went on for a long time with them claiming to never have received my package even though it was signed for. I did not get a response from someone with any free will it seemed for a long time. After a FULL MONTH since my package arrived I received an email saying my ticket was being terminated. I pleaded that my case be left open and for someone to help me with this absurdity.Long story short 40+ emails later and nearly 2 full months I received a new product that was fully functional. I felt insulted throughout the entire process being promised a 2 week turnaround maximum from the start. I understand the with COVID things might be a little slower but the utterly abysmal communication their team showed drove me mad while this went on. After about 6 weeks I gave up hope and started looking into different products and ways to contact someone who could actually help me. They were mildly apologetic in the end but it was far too little far too late.In the end I now own a new Razer mouse but dread the day it breaks down under warranty and I have to go through this again. I recently had a Razer brand headset break due to wear and tear and I will certainly be looking for a provider outside of Razer for a new one.If any Razer team member see's this I would be happy to regale you with the details that lead to this review in full.Thanks for reading hope this helps you decision process :)
4,This is what I was looking for. I've heard to many issues with the Naga trinity. While I'd love to have the side options the Trinity does.
5,I bought my Naga used and it looks new and works like new. Very nice mouse. Has the 12 buttons on the left side so you can stop using your keyboard to use skills (or clicking the skills in game).
5,Fits very well in my large hand and is quite comfortable. I usually have a relaxed palm grip but tend to switch to a claw grip when the gaming moments get tense and both of these grip styles have worked well for it.No double clicking issues I have noticed at all thankfully so I'm happy with that. The mouse scroll wheel feels a little rigid/rough rather than smooth and slidey but I personally feel like it gives me more control that way. The finger rest on the right side of it could be a little more comfortable it's all plastic with nothing super special to write about it. The 12 button dial pad is easy enough to use too I don't get lost remembering where the buttons are with my thumb despite them not being textured differently the hardest row of buttons to reach for me would have to be the third row of buttons 7-9.Overall this mouse has worked well for me for my first gaming session. It's comfortable lightweight for something that is supposed to be on the heavier side and slides smoothly like it's on ice. 4.5/5.
3,Had this mouse (Naga Trinity) for 3 years and it was to replace a 2012 Edition Naga. 3 Years to the date I get the misclick/double click issue with the switch. The 2012 Naga still works and its been over twice as long. Just shows the quality Razer has been keeping up... Also they could make their software much better that would also be great as Synapse is still bad.The price for this mouse to only last 3 years is not good at all.
5,This mouse goes hard.
5,I love the customizable DPI that you can change with the click of a button! This mouse is very lightweight but doesn't feel cheap. Easy to set up. The program to customize the RGB lighting takes a little bit to learn but it's still relatively simple and easy once you learn to navigate the interface. My last Razer mouse lasted for over 3 years. I got this mouse because my last one started having connection issues and would unexpectedly stop working altogether in the middle of my games at least once a day. I'm hoping this one lasts just as long! Very happy with the investment. However I will say that if you don't need/use the side buttons I would go for a less expensive mouse (Razer or another quality company such as Logitech or Corsair). I play a lot of video games so I definitely like them for additional easy keybinds but if you won't need those for your purposes look elsewhere. You can get just as high quality a mouse for much cheaper without the buttons if you won't absolutely use them
5,I bought this mouse after purchasing the Corsair Scimitar Pro a few months ago to learn how to play with the 12 button mice that are commonly used in World of Warcraft. I have always "clicked" and wanted to give it a try; needless to say Im not going back. How the Razer Naga compares to the Corsair Scimitar? I believe the Naga is superior in the fact that I can use it not only as my MMO mouse but can switch the panels depending on what I choose to play. I really love this functionality as I tend to fluctuate games pretty often. I enjoy the charging dock and wireless is always convenient. The mouse is quite ergonomic though the Corsair Scimitar has a better slope to the top of the mouse which for some reason feels a tad bit more comfortable in my hands since they are on the larger side. Both mice have the ring finger rest on the side which is great.Overall I believe this mouse is awesome and I don't ever have to buy another one again as this one already does it all
4,old razer mouse had double clicking issue thought I'd try this since I do play MMO games but Not a fan of the bulkyness ... fps and or any click percison games have been taking my awhile to get used to I'm a couple months in still doesn't feel right
2,I’ve been using this mouse from Razer for sometime now. Initially got my first one maybe 2 years ago now. Really enjoyed the multi plates for playing WoW and FPS. The first one held up fairly well for about 9 months but started having issues with the faceplate connection even with cleaning the pins and plate properly. Bought my second one and that only lasted about 6 months. The scroll wheel ended up getting jammed up and wouldn’t work. Bought a third and again ran into the issue with the face plates not connecting well after another 6 months. Seems that pin connection starts to fail from swapping the plates back and forth over just a short period of time even with the proper cleaning method that Razer recommends. Decided to buy yet another one but this time kept the third one to dedicate one for MMO and the other for FPS. It was working well for me up until last night. The brand new mouse I’ve had for only 3 months that I’ve used solely for FPS has gotten the jammed up scroll wheel. It’s been a good mouse for it’s performance but the durability of this mouse is horrendous. Now looking into another mouse to replace the one I just bought and it will not be a Razer mouse ever again.
3,I see reviews about this being a large mouse. Its not. I mean its long but its hardly what I'd consider large. To me it's much smaller than a G600 or a Utechsmart 12 button mouse. I have trouble with carpal tunnel in my left hand so without 12 thumb buttons I wouldn't be able to play games like WoW or Black Desert without one. Pressing individual number keys constantly with my left hand as in WoW and especially the hundreds of key combinations required in Black Desert would render me completely incapable of playing those games at all. But with this I can assign the main functions to my thumb keys and play away.I ordered a used one. It did not come in it's original box nor was the software included. Which is fine with me since included DVD software is always slightly outdated and you have to download the newest version anyway. I've used the Naga for years. The middle row of buttons sometimes refuse to work but all it takes is to remove the thumb panel and wipe the contacts with a Q tip dipped in alcohol and it works flawlessly.I will never use the other two side panel attachments and even after a short while I have no idea where they even are nor do I care.Edit: Well after a couple months Im getting the unresolvable left click problem so many others mention. If this happens to so many people then sadly it's not going to be worth buying another and I'll just have to go with Utechsmart or another brand. I had a Utechsmart before and it worked for about 2 years rather than 2 months but I sure will miss the Razer.
3,So unfortanately not all hands are created equally. My hands a bit too large to fit this mouse comfortably.The side plates are quite handy. However take note of the 12 button side panel. The buttons are very small and the angle of each button aren't exactly aggressive. So if you have large thumbs like me it'll feel mostly flat. Making it very difficult to determine what button you're on. I oftern found myself having to count and recount using the very tip of my thumb. Which isn't exactly comfortable.The software Razer provides is plug and play (windows will automatically download and install it if you're connected to the internet) and it's very easy to use.Overall this is a very nice nice if you don't have larger than normal hands and I would recomend it. Too bad I can't reliably use it. It needs to be just a bit larger for both the mouse itself and as well as the buttons on the 12 button side plate.
5,Easy to install comfortable to use. Used for gaming and working. No backlash or creaks.
5,I got this mouse to play destiny 2. The extra buttons over a common 2 button layout have been super convenient. I use the 6 button layout the most and it has been extremely useful. I don't use the 12 button layout often because I don't need it for my game. Razer's RGB and the controlling software are the best I have ever used. The macro recording was also extremely easy and was very easy to share with others. The battery life felt a little shorter than other options I have used but the charging cable Razer provides is so light and flexible that I have not even noticed it when playing while charging. The shape of the mouse required some getting used to since it is not a very standard shape but I find it very comfortable. I love the grip below the buttons and on the right side as it gives the mouse a little more feel and makes it very easy to lift without it shifting in your hand. The weight balance is excellent and can be picked up with your pinky and thumb with no problems. Overall I love the product and am very happy with my purchase.
4,As a gaming mouse this is great!As a replacement for the discontinued Naga Hex mouse that was discontinued in 2019 it takes some getting accustomed to. This is the only reason I give it a 4-star review as opposed to 5.About the mouse:The ergonomic design while comfortable to hold can strain your pinky if you pick up your mouse often- just a heads up. The different/removable face plates make for great user options and the 7-button face plate makes for a decent replacement of the Naga Hex.
2,This is more of a gripe with Razer's godawful Synapse program than the mouse itself.  I have been a Razer loyalist for many years.  I bought my first Naga back in 2013 or so and have stuck with them to the present day.  They usually lasted a year or two before needing to be replaced with my extremely heavy use but now I've run into an issue that isn't related to the mouse itself no longer functioning.Razer Synapse is a broken piece of garbage program.  For those of you who don't know this is Razer's programming software used to rebind keys and the like on the Nagas.  Earlier versions of the mouse had switches to toggle the keypad from functioning as number keys to as an actual keypad and this was all I ever wanted to use it for.  This is no longer the case and it instead has a button to cycle through various modes you can program in Razer Synapse.  I just wanted a keypad that I can control with my thumb for MMOs and MOBAs.  Simple.  I didn't think that was a lot to ask for.Apparently Razer Synapse does think it's a lot to ask for.  Fine.  I'll download your stupid spyware program.  I won't look into what "bouncy castle crypto" is and try to not think about it.  But you know what sucks?  What happens when the program doesn't work on your PC anymore?  When it won't launch and reinstalling it doesn't work?  What about when you communicate with Razer's USELESS SUPPORT TEAM for WEEKS without them being able to fix it?  When all you wanted out of the mouse was for it to be a KEYPAD AND NOTHING ELSE.  ALL I WANTED WAS A FEATURE THAT RAZER HAD RIGHT SINCE 2013 AND DECIDED "HEY LET'S MAKE THIS HARDER THAN IT HAS TO BE."So.  After establishing Synapse didn't work on my PC anymore for whatever godforsaken reason I simply went to a friend's house and used his to set the profiles for my mouse.  Very annoying but whatever I only wanted one thing so it shouldn't have been an issue.And then...It stopped working as a keypad.  It's been about six months since I set it up at a friend's house and suddenly none of the side buttons work as intended anymore.  I try to install Synapse thinking maybe it's functional by now.  I was wrong.  It blue screens my PC when I try to install it.  I already know Razer Support is totally useless.I am NEVER buying another Razer product after this nonsense.
5,I purchased this mouse over 2 years ago and used it constantly. I'm a gamer and it gets ALOT of use. This thing has been the best mouse I've ever owned so much so that today I finally gave in to the fact that mine was dying and I needed a new one. Without second thought I placed an order for a new one. I highly recommend them as an MMO gamer!
5,This isbthe corded version. I personally don't like wireless products for gaming because I game for hours and don't want power to run out.Now on to this mouse. It has the best of all worlds. I already had a good gaming mouse with the 12 buttons. But my biggest problem is I have big hands and I wasn't using all 12 buttons.This mouse solved that problem. I piped off the 12 button plate and put on the round button plate and programed the functions and its been great. The round face spreads the buttons and makes them a little larger. Large enough for my hand.The mouse is comfortable. The cord is long enough and it's very responsive. I haven't had to adjust my DPI at all. The weight is not adjustable but not a problem for me. I don't like a lightweight mouse. So this one is on the standard heavy side but feels good.You won't be disappointed due to the versatility.
5,I bought Naga Pro back in September never feeling like MMO mice would compete in the lower weight world. It was lighter than my old Trinity but still a very heavy option. It also had the same feeling in the clicks my Trinity had. Very little positive feedback and felt kind of like a hair trigger. It was wireless though and that was cool. Then Razer brings out the X. It cut the fat. Less buttons that I personally never found myself using anyway. No replacement plates just 12 key. Annnd it’s nearly 40 grams lighter. Hallelujah! It’s cable while not the lightest is getting closer to the cables seen on Glorious mice and it’s not a big deal. Another solid point to make and this may vary from mouse to mouse. The clicks are much better. Though not as positive when clicking as the Logitech G Pro or even the Razer Viper Ultimate. It’s much more satisfying than previous incarnations. It is the definitive MMO mouse IMO.
3,I mean the mouse functionality is really good.  It's probably the best out there. But I like to bind movement to my mouse scroll up and down sometimes and it's ridiculously noisy. All day it's like this loud plastic gear noise non stop. It's completely unnecessary.  Why would anyone need to loud mouse wheel? It's so aggravating I'm starting to avoid the mouse wheel for movement just to not hear the sound.Would be 5 stars without this issue. Other than the side buttons are VERY sensitive and it's very easy to activate them with normal movement pressure on the mouse.
5,My husband loves it so much that he has recommended it to all his gamer friends (who already have expensive mouses but they like his more). He likes being able to switch the side depending on the game.
5,I bought this mouse to replace the Razer Naga Epic Chroma MMO Gaming Mouse I bought in 2015. The 2015 Razer mouse scroll wheel would sometimes scroll up when I was scrolling down and vise versa. So far I like this mouse a little better because the scroll wheel has stronger clicks. Other than that it seems to be more or less the same as the 2015 Razer mouse with 1 exception. The replaceable side buttons.The fact that the left side of the mouse can be customized with 2 other button options is nice but I don't know why anyone would want to take off the 12 button option. I have gotten used to it even though it seemed a little overwhelming when I got the 2015 Razer mouse. I highly recommend this mouse with any game that has an action bar like a MMO. The 12 buttons on the side can also come in handy to switch between weapons in first-person shooters. For productivity the Razer Synapse app can be used to configure the 12 buttons for repetitive tasks.
5,I just replaced my mouse with the same one because there is no reason to ever get a different one ever
5,This mouse is great if your play all sorts of games from MMO's to competitive shootersOne thing to make sure is not to get any finger prints or oils on the contacts good thing is to keep them in either a drawer so no dust gets on the contacts. Besides that swapping is easy and the software always detects the right module and applies the right profile for each module. For example when I switch from the 6 button to two button the software will switch the profile of the mouse accordingly
5,I’m a fan of Razer products. They’ve lasted a long time for me before needing replacing. My current mouse is great. I was skeptical of wireless but I haven’t had any problems with mine. The battery lasted an entire week and when it came time to charge it was quick and easy to slap in the power cord to charge it. Then when it’s done just unplug and go. Overall it’s kinda pricy but I think it worthy.
5,I started with the Naga Epic years ago bought the Naga Trinity love it. I bought a gaming laptop and wanted a gaming mouse that could go Bluetooth. I really like my Razer products didn't realize the Pro had all 3 connections or I would have bought it instead of the Trinity. Now that I've had a couple days I'm going to have to get another Naga Pro.The Pro is lighter than the corded Trinity. The only real differences are you get a 6 button side plate with the Pro instead of a 7 button side plate and the "4" and "5" mouse buttons are recessed in the Pro versus the Trinity.Sideplates are not swappable between Trinity and Pro but doesn't matter to me since I use the 12 button side plate.I have not noticed any difference in lag no matter how I run the mouse corded BT Hyperspeed wireless....doesn't matter no difference.RGB lighting effects with the Synapse 3 software which is great to sync RGB if in to that.If you're trying to decide between the Trinity or Pro just buy the Pro.Edit: Bought a second Naga Pro and charging base package while "on sale"...I originally bought the Pro for the laptop and was happy with the Trinity on the tower PC...I like the Pro so much better it was a no brainer. Amazing to me how the wireless version is actually lighter than the wired version (no battery).
4,Mouse is great for mmos not so much fps games or shooters. If thats your cup of tea go with a basilisk
3,Its a good mmo mouse great for FFXIV. Bought a second one after my first one's wire broke because I liked it so much so that first one would get 5 stars from me it was great.This new one's scroll wheel feels much different than the first one's though and does not scroll nearly as smoothly and occasionally locks up pretty disappointed by that. :( They are the same exact model so I'm not sure why that is. Would rather not have to get yet another replacement since I've already put my grip stickers on it. Beware the scroll wheel's scroll quality inconsistency I guess.
4,Except for Ergonomics I gave it a 5-star rating.  I've had several MMO mouses over the years and the Naga performs the best in every area except ergonomics.  For most people it will be great but for me not so much.  I have a splay in the fingers of my right hand and the ring finger is leaning to the right enough that the slope of the mouse buttons lets it fall off the button to the right side of the mouse and my pinkie falls further. So it is totally out of position. If I need to use the wheel to dodge-roll and then block with the right button I can't press the right mouse button quickly enough in combat to save my character. in PVP.  So it will work for most people but I still play better with the Logitech G600 which around half the price.
5,Is it one or three? It isn't everything all at once but it is once all at everything<---WTF IDK... This is an awesome mouse though I bought this in April and it's still going strong. I game fairly regularly and I haven't suffered any sticky buttons or issues with this mouse at all... Razer is great.. I also own the Blackshark V2 pro wireless headset and the sound quality is amazing.I almost forgot they have good apps to go with their products that are constantly updated.This is not a paid review and I am not a bot.Or am I...
4,The hardware is fantastic. The three different faceplates slip in without a fight and work right away. Now you may have to reload the Razer configuration profile if you have alternate key bindings to the various  buttons and so forth but that's somewhat understandable. The mouse has a solid feel without being 'heavy'. I'm not a super fast FPS player but I'm satisfied in its responsiveness; it seems flawless to me.That said I'm just so over this entire keyboard/mouse ecosphere that needs to be on-line to sync with some profile. Why? Just let me download the program to my pc and let me worry about saving configurations and whatnot.
5,I’ve been using this mouse for three days now and I absolutely love it. It feels super nice to hold in comparison to the Logitech G MMO mouse with the similar appearance material and all. The buttons on the side feel nice and soft when I press them they have a very comfy tactile feel that I suspect is because the buttons are not angled like other 12-button mice. The appearance is super cool was concerned if the RGB would cycle through colors like my keyboard and it does ^^ so I am very happy with my purchase thus far. I’ve been seeing reviews with concerns about durability so I’m hoping mine lasts DX if so I may consider buying more Razer products in the future!That being said as one last note this mouse is good for small hands. I have very small hands and the Logitech MMO mouse was far too flat and long so I couldn’t reach the buttons and the mouse felt heavy. This is the complete opposite. It’s lighter rounder and overall not as long so it is a much more pleasant experience for small hands.
5,The mouse is good for everything
5,I've owned a Razor Naga since the very first version came out. This is my forth one now. I have worn each of them into the ground. While the trinity did die rather faster than the others it still last a good two years of intense use.The IR switches can actually be felt on the Naga X. The response difference is actually noticeable where I expected it be trivial at best. I am really hoping that these switches which no longer rely on metal to metal for a signal will last through the paces I put these mice through. Hours of furious clicking in instanced raids and other encounters and long duration holds while running around exploring and doing daily quests in WoW and FFXIV. Now that the spring no longer doubles as the contact I hope it much more purpose built!So far I'd say a must buy for any MMO player whom is serious about never reaching down to "click" an action bar ever. Everything must have a keybind!
3,In 2020 I decided to build a gaming rig with the latest and greatest peripherals. I was immediately drawn to the Razer Trinity Naga for the chroma and interchangeable side plates to maximize usability across all genres of games. Not sure if it was coincidence or planned obsolescence but the left click no longer functions properly 2 days after warranty expired. When I searched online I found many with the same problem. A faulty macro switch. What good is a chroma enabled gaming mouse with interchangeable side plates if the main left and right click doesn’t work. I have a $5.00 mouse from 15 years ago that still functions properly. Do not buy unless you’re going to use as art.
5,Best mouse in the whole world.
5,I needed to find a gaming mouse that had several buttons for MMORPG gaming but not TOOOOO many. I was going to go with a 17 key and discovered this mouse. It is absolutely the best of all worlds since you can interchange the buttons! My husband prefers the round (8?) keys for all around gaming! Great purchase! Came before Christmas even!
3,I tend to use my gaming mouse a lot. on average I’d say 6 hours a day. Before I bought this mouse I had a Razer Naga which lasted me almost 5 years before buttons became less responsive and required you to click them very hard to work.This mouse is basically the exact same as the Razer Naga but with seemingly cheaper materials/make. It’s easy to tell that the mouse isn’t as “solid” as the old Razer Naga.So I’ve been using this mouse for about a year now I think and I’ve started to have an issue with the left click. Imagine holding down the left click button in order to copy a sentence/text document. You drag the mouse down to copy all of it but half way down it “un-clicks” and stops the copying action. Basically the left click is clicking multiple times when you hold it down which is a major problem in several of the games I play or even when I’m just trying to copy stuff in my day to day google searches.I must say I’m sad to be having troubles after 1 year I was hoping to have this mouse for at least 2 or 3 years especially considering my last Razer mouse lasted 5 years. 😢All of that being said.. it’s a pretty good mouse for the average gamer I think. I haven’t had any other issues and in the vast majority of games the left click multi clicking isn’t causing an issue.. but for games like Path of Exile or Diablo.. it’s disastrous.
2,Mouse worked great for about 5 months. I got this naga trinity and use the 7 panel hex side plate to replace my old razer naga hex (replaced the hex because scroll wheel broke loose after like 8 years). Now the side panel buttons randomly stop working. I don’t know if there is an issue with the metal contacts on the bottom of the plate or with the buttons themselves but it’s really annoying when you’re in the middle of a match and suddenly pressing a button that could have made a great play just doesn’t work. Giving the mouse a little percussive maintenance seems to make it work for another couple minutes and I’ve also tried cleaning the metal contacts with isopropanol. The issue always returns within hours at most. In regards to the razer synapse 3 software it is decent except for some reason it’s way more of a hassle to setup macros to buttons than in the previous versions of synapse. And once a macro is setup it doesn’t seem to work a fluidly as it should.
5,This is the third time I have bought this mouse. I will never game without it.
5,You get what you pay for here. The mouse is lightweight has preset dpi changer built in below the scroll wheel 12 buttons on the side and your normal left/right/mouse wheel configuration. Had one a while ago and love it so much I bought it. The review categories aren't accurate as it asked me for battery life when I purposefully bought it because it's a wired mouse.
3,I finally had to replace my old naga after 10 years so what could go wrong w/ the newer naga?  3 side button variations instead of 1 same general shape/design as the prior one as well so looking at this it seems like a good replacement.  They were aiming for great movement and I agree this mouse definitely moves around much smoother than my old one did.Unfortunately what you can't tell from the picture is the mouse wheel is a nightmare.  The scrolling clicking sound will drive you nuts but that part I can manage to ignore since my headsets good enough to block most of it out.  Actual scrolling on the other hand I can't ignore. The scroll wheel practically fights you and up is requires more force than any other mouse I've seen.  Scrolling down requires even more force then scrolling up does and whats more bothersome than it being so hard to scroll down is the fact up/down aren't the same.  I'll frequently find myself scrolling down not nearly far enough and scrolling up too far because of the difference between them.  Then there is always the chance that while trying to push it so hard you end up making the wheel click down causing random things to happen depending on what programs you are in.So while it may boast great DPI and movement to improve gaming if you are doing anything that requires the scroll wheel this mouse is going to handicap you at that game.
5,I'm a fan of Razer products. They always last me a REALLY long time of approx. 8+ hours per day of daily use. I only had to replace my other mouse because it was 5 years old and I tried to clean it and broke it myself.
4,For call of duty and other games the large aray of buttons make it convenient for button combinations. Good fit for my hand to and the responce time is what I expect from a wired gaming mouse.
5,My husband gave me this mouse to I could play MMO’s more easily but as soon as he bought it he got jealous and decided he needed one too.The mouse is very responsive and easy to use on different surfaces although I will only recommend a mouse pad but at least it will work at LAN parties where you forgot your mouse pad.It feels really good to both mine and my husbands hands and our hand sizes are extremely different. As of right now neither of us have experienced any fatigue of pain in our wrists.My favorite part is that the side panels are easy to switch out. They are held on simply by magnets and connect/disconnect within seconds.Some of the side panel parts do feel like they could snap if jostled too much so I’d recommend to keep them in a box to avoid breaking.
4,I have a love-hate relationship with this mouse.Pros:ErgonomicSide button module is removable and has 3 different modules to choose fromProgrammable buttons to 1-touch just about anything.Supports macrosRGBVarious color schemesVery responsivecompletely customizable DPICons:Razor software needed to run.Constant software upgradesStored profiles do not change lighting unless the software is running.Other thoughts:This is my second naga trinity I've bought in the past 2yrs.  The first one developed a left mouse button problem causing the button to release when holding the button.  However I like the 7 button circular side button module so much that I just bought another one.Overall I think the pros on this mouse outweigh the cons I just wish I had the option to run it without the software.  I don't hate Razer cortex but some might.
4,Got this for my son for Christmas and he loves it but it was missing the charging cable so he had to purchase one. Disappointed.
4,Overall I like this mouse but the side buttons are way too sensitive. I'm used to resting my thumb on the buttons without fear of accidentally pressing one or more of them but you very much CANNOT do that with this mouse.
1,So the physical mouse is very nice.  The cord is woven the lights are pretty and the changeable panels are pretty neat.  The problem is the software.  Synapse is garbage.  Razer has pretty much admitted this.  The functionality of the buttons will fail randomly in ONLY certain programs.  Unfortunately they're hugely popular programs like Discord Steam and a number of top title games played through those services.  I've tried every fix there is on every forum I could find and have had no luck.  I sent back the original mouse thinking it must be a hardware issue but nope I have the same problem with the 2nd mouse.  It only seems to affect the 7 button panel which is unfortunate because i bought this to replace my Hex and that panel is the one I want to use.  Another issue I have is that the functionality on the buttons are linked to keyboard buttons or pre-existing mouse buttons (button 3 for mouse wheel 4 for next page 5 for previous w/e).  The way its advertised on its website is as follows:"The more buttons you have instant access to the greater your advantage becomes. With up to 19 programmable buttons be spoilt for choice whether you’re assigning just the essentials or going full-out to bind item hotkeys spells or any other in-game commands you need."I was expecting additional buttons to program not buttons that I could bind to already existing buttons so that's disappointing.  The only way to get my system to re-recognize the buttons is to do a reboot.  I've tried killing all programs ending the entire process trees including Synapse and Razer Central starting Discord and Steam fresh with that and it still won't recognize the 7 button panel.  The failure seems to be completely random sometimes it will be good for a day others it will be good for a week.  It's a huge annoyance.  I will use it until I can't stand it anymore but I will never buy another one.UPDATE:  Since writing this i have had the same functionality failure on the 12-button panel.  Because of this I have changed my rating from 2 stars to 1 star.  Razer has reached out to me so I will attempt to work with them to solve this problem and update this review further if a fix is found.UPDATE:  Razor tech support got a hold of me and basically told me to try all the stuff I had already attempted by scouring forums.  The software still has these major issues that make the mouse utter garbage. I'm not sure how you go from an amazing product like the Hex to putting out this trash.  Since the last update the mouse has now developed a "flicker?". Pressing the LMB will sometimes cause it to rapidly register 3-4 presses. Pressure applied doesn't matter nor does adjusting any parameters through windows of Synapse.  I'd be hard pressed to ever buy another Razor product after this awful awful experience.  I've paid $90 for a mouse that only barely functions 1/2 the time I use it have exchanged it once and trouble shot it myself for hours and with their support for hours.  I could not be more disappointed.
4,Picked it up to play FFXIV and to that end it does exactly what i payed for and i happy with it. If It was $80 instead of the $150 i payed minus the 2 extra side plates I'm never going to use i would feel better about it.A word of warning for some reason with my PC it takes the mouse about a minute to wake up out of sleep on blue tooth which got annoying real fast. The next logical step is to plug in the included 2.4Ghz USB receiver. Make sure you put it the front of you system away from any wifi as it interfered with the mouse causing what i can only describe as interment freezing every 6 secs moving the mouse around.Now I'm going to pray they fixed the double clicking that has plagued all the previous nagas.
5,I got pretty good mileage out of the 2013 (I think?) Naga Epic Chroma but it was about time for a refresh! The 12 button grid is a must for me even in games like Fortnite and Apex because it drastically reduces the need to move your left hand from the WASD keys. It obviously shines in MMORPGs like WoW and MOBAs like LoL but I don't think it gets enough consideration for the shooter genre.As far as build quality the texture feels great all around and the buttons have a light crisp click to them. The buttons on the 12 button grid could use a little more resistance but not to the point of being a detriment. I cannot speak for the other two attachments as I have not used them but it is nice that Razer gives you an option here and makes them VERY easy to hot-swap. The RGB lighting on the grid also seems brighter than its predecessor.Ergonomically the mouse is very comfortable even for someone with long fingers like myself.I also like that there's a dedicated profile button on the bottom and that you can save them to onboard memory. I guess that's standard these days but still very nice to have!Overall a great mouse for no matter your needs!
4,I owned two naga epics previously about 10 years ago but they both developed a double clicking problem within a year.I decided to try to give the Naga Trinity Gaming Mouse a shot hoping they would've improved the design after a decade but was very disappointed as it developed a double clicking problem after about 7 months.I'm very disappointed that Razer hasn't fixed the design flaw as it makes many games completely unplayable when the issue starts.Update 10/28/20 - I reached out to to Razer support as this was still under warranty and they're sending me a replacement once they receive the original. I'm updating the review to 4 stars because of their good customer service.The razer naga series mice are definitely among the best I've ever used I just hope one day soon they double click issue is resolved for good.
2,I got the Naga Trinity the buttons would bug out I've had them just plain not work until plugging it back in or taking the side buttons off and putting it back on I've had it type constantly until I unplugged it or the mouse just stop working randomly in the middle of something. I keep buying razor products despite every single one being a mess.
5,Well its not really much of a secret...the left panel is interchangeable so you can have either two seven or 12 buttons.  I use the 12 button one and if you need to pick up the mouse and move it its difficult to do so without pressing a button.  Not impossible just difficult.You can program macros into the buttons but I had a hard time getting that to work properly on simple tasks like "open Youtube" or "Pull up MS Explorer."  I'm sure I'll figure it out but most likely I'll shrug and forget about it.The tray icon that allows you to change from one profile to another isn't very intuitive but once you figure it out it works fine.As to materials its not as hefty as the Logitech it replaced which had adjustable weights you could insert to give it some friction and heft.  I miss that.Apart from that I like it and hopefully it will give me the same ten years of service that my old Logitech gave me.  Yep...I know...a piece of Logitech gear lasted ten years.  I was shocked too but here we are.
5,I like the fact it comes with three variations of the number pads on the side great for any game use
5,razer quality has gone down hill so much .. i had a naga hex for like 6 years.. wanted a wireless.. go the naga pro.. i had also bought wirless blackwidow keyboard.. using both on 2.4ghz was impossible they would constantly fight over connection it seemed like. blue tooth was pointless for keyboard.. so i just sent back and go  a wired one..  the mouse works fine but the rubber on the side has already worn away after about 4 months.. where as the one thats like 6 years old is just fine.. the battery life sucks.. unless you turn thr birghtness on the mouse down to like 15%.. these will be the last razer products i purchase all the products have had firmware updates and still didnt fix some of the double key press issues and connection problems
5,Note the naga pro has the new light actuated switches that gets rid of the double click issues that plague the old naga design.I own the mamba wireless as well but I prefer the naga pro. naga pro is a one and done kind of mouse that covers any usage scenario. The side panel swap is good for fps games where you dont need the numpad panel so you can get a good thumb position and grip on the mouse. the wireless switch can use either the 2.4 connection on the usb dongle or blutooth. theres also a wired connection as well. the usb dongle can be stored in the mouse by popping off the magnetic side panel and putting it in its slot.the scroll wheel is silent unlike the mamba's very audible scroll wheel. all other buttons are crisp clicks. I own the corsair 12 button mmo mouse and that one has slightly mushy buttons in comparison.the synapse 3.0 software is really straight forward to use.
2,I used this for my daily gaming and web browsing. I love the switchable side plates I use them often probably my favorite part about this mouse. Product is great overall software is fine and the wireless is cool but I rarely use it. HUGE PROBLEM in the durability.Mouse is uncomfortable to use only 6 months later due to the worn out sides. You'd expect that for such a premium product that it would last longer very disappointing. I wouldn't mind just buying a new rubber pad but it seems like they don't bother to offer easily accessible replacement parts.
5,I had an older version of this mouse that worked great for 7 years before it would just stop registering intermittently.  I went with another mouse but ended up buying this one because why f* with something that isn't broken??I love the upgraded super flexible wire.I don't love that the newer version of this mouse only has one button under the wheel whereas the older version had 2
5,If you play MMOs and you use a Naga you are pretty much stuck using a Naga forever.  Not as a bad thing but because the number of buttons and the usability it gives is just amazing!I've been using iterations of the Razer Naga for 8+ years and I think this is my third one (so ~4 year lifespan).  This one comes with a lot of great configuration and the software to configure it pretty easy to use.  The shape changed a little bit from previous versions (used 2014 before this) but I got used to it pretty quickly.Battery life is pretty fantastic I work from home and game in the evening and I don't have any issues as long as I plug in over night.  If I forget I just plug in the mouse while using it and it doesn't impact mobility at all and still charges pretty quickly so I can unplug again later.
5,Razer is my goto for mice and keyboards.  They are long lasting devices that I know I can count on to give me awesome performance for years to come.  My last mouse lasted about 7 years of heavy gaming...so I dont expect to have to buy another mouse for a long time ;-)  I like that I can switch out the side panels on this.  I really only use the 2 button one as the others would require that I have to remember what number is what LOL...too much for my elderly gaming self these days.  Great mouse.  I highly recommend this model and even the cheaper models by Razor.  They put together very high quality mice and keyboards.  I cant recommend their headsets as i haven't owned one...not a big headset fan but I am sure they are good too.
5,I've used it both for gaming and for office work.Currently I can tell you that it works as a regular mouse in MAC it works great as a gaming mouse on windows. There's also this weird bug where the sensitivity is different between windows and Linux on dual boot. It holds around 1 week - 10 days before it needs a recharge. It's quite lightweight in my opinion considering its size. I have it for around a year. Very pleased with it and would highly recommend it
5,Two features I would love to see in the next Naga would be a dedicated hypershift button (similar to the g-shift button on the logitech G600) and a wireless option.  I'm not sure why they discontinued the Naga Epic which was wireless but I'm assuming that the next Naga will be wireless much like the new Mamba Wireless.My only real complaint is that the rubber they used on the sides of the mouse are not very grippy.  In fact they are pretty slippery.  My hands don't get to sweaty but even still the mouse does not grip well when re-positioning is required.The swap-able sides were at first very novel but I find myself just sticking with the 12 button panel.  The other two side panels aren't really necessary for this style of mouse.  If you're getting the Naga you're getting if for the 12 button thumb panel.  The mouse isn't necessarily heavy but a lot of the weight could have been shaved off with a set side panel because each side panel uses heavy magnets to connect to the body of the mouse.The mouse is very comfortable to hold.  All the buttons are very tactile and easy to press.  I also own the Logitech G600 which is a great mouse but the buttons on the Naga are far superior.
4,It's a great mouse. My flaws with it though is that the 7 button mouse has its numbers go 1 2 3 6 7 5 4 going clockwise. Also if you don't blow on the magnets every time you switch out the buttons they won't work.Lastly the 7 button and 12 button buttons don't fit perfectly into the actual mouse meaning it constantly feels like you're pushing back into place
5,While the original Trinity was a good design it had some serious quality issues with the side panels not being recognized causing the mouse to just not function. This mouse fixed that problem updates the surface of the mouse with a much more comfortable grippy finish and the battery for wireless use lasts a long time and gives the mouse a solid weight.
1,Side panel buttons are infuriatingly unreliable especially on the 12-button MMO panel. Random buttons will just not fire until you press and wiggle the button around or random buttons stop working altogether; sometimes you have to pop off the panel sometimes you have to unplug and re-plug in the USB connection (both in wired and wireless modes) to get things to work and if it's a pogo pin contact issue it's a major design flaw because these are as clean and unobstructed as I can get them (and no I'm not using any sort of harsh cleaner that would damage the contacts).Also somehow this mouse is so finnicky that it wiggles on click; I've never had a mouse where I've had this much trouble double-clicking on something because it slightly drags with each click.Like what kind of competitive gamer would depend on this mouse where buttons just randomly stop working with no indication or apparent reason where unplugging the mouse is the fix? I can't understand how this gets such good reviews; I'm going back to a cheapo $30 MMO mouse which is FAR more reliable and never buying another Razer product again. What overpriced gimmicky garbage.
5,best all in one mouse  you play shooters ? theres a mod for that  MMO's theres a mod with 12 mappable keys for that and if you love MMo's but you have tiny hands or are clumsy as F theres a 7 keys module for that as well best 3 mouse in one evar !
1,I'll start with something nice. It feels nice to hold and if it worked properly I'm sure it would be great at what it was in theory designed for. Unfortunately my positive experience with this stops about there.I used to own a much older version of this. I think it was the 2012 version? It was fantastic! It worked it had buttons I could change to be whatever I wanted (even macros or switching configs) and I generally had a good experience with it until it stopped working. So I thought I'd try replacing it with the latest version. Bad move on my part.As a mouse if you ignore the swappable panels or Synapse 3 it's great! You can point you can click you can scroll...you know everything any other mouse in the world does. If however you want to change any of those programmable buttons you have to install Synapse 3. So I did. During this installation various drivers also install. Drivers that turn the mouse into a glorified lightbulb. Uninstalling Synapse 3 and the drivers goes back to square one: works as a mouse but can't reprogram any of the side buttons. So tried talking to Razer Support about it and it takes them about a week to want a whole ton of information (including video of me showing this process). It's been almost three weeks since then and I haven't heard so much as a "we'll look into this". Nothing.In the meantime I had been using this little junky mouse while I waited on Razer to at least attempt a solution but finally got around to just switching to the two-button side panel and using that to at least get a feel for using the thing in general. Wish I'd done that earlier since I've used it for a couple of hours and see another problem: the side panel doesn't want to register properly that it is in fact attached. Not hard to notice that it isn't registering the light-up parts of the mouse...don't while it still works as a standard mouse. That whole "point click scroll" thing? Yeah that's about all it does. Can try fiddling with the side panel to get it to sit in just the right spot for it to notice that yes the side panel is actually there but it might shift back out of position while being used. (While still not appearing to move in the process of getting it back into position or it shifting back to not being registered as actually being there.)Really makes me wish I hadn't waited so long for Razer's support system to say absolutely nothing because now I'm two days beyond Amazon's return window for a mouse design to have swappable side panels that may or may not work when attached and even if they did I'm stuck with whatever the default configuration is for their functions.
5,I'm pretty tough on mice and this one holds up well while maintaining accuracy.  The sensitivity buttons allow me to change during game-play if needed and while editing vids and such.  It's my new go-to mouse.
4,When you return to razer product after dealing with superior hardware with corsair all because their software is a nightmare and you just want to press a button to bind keys to your 12 button keypad on your mouse and be done with it.  Am I expecting this $60 mouse to last long nope do better build products exist? definitely.  Razer has the best software and its just simple and painless to make macros or rebind the mouse which is the only reason you buy a mouse like this anyway.
5,I've been using this mouse for quite a while now and I have to say I f***ing love it. I've used the old razer Naga for a while as well as a red dragon and I have to say the quality is great.Pros:The modular design and ability to swap on a whim is amazing I use this so often when swapping from mobas and mmos to fps games. I've forgotten until like 5 minutes into a league of legends game and being able to switch from the two key to the 12 key side has saved me so much hassle.The razer software is kind of pain at times but the ability to map variable DPI and switch that has helped a lot as a wrist mouse kind of gamer when I need a little extra action per second.Cons:You really have to get used to the feeling of the Naga mice it's bulkier and takes up more of your hand than most mice. If you're used to smaller mice or have a smaller hand it might not be the mouse for you.The razer software is a pain especially if you mix older and newer razer products.
5,
3,I bought this in August 2020 and it would double-post clicks (or sometimes not post at all) for maybe three months. I emailed Razer directly about the issue and never received an email in response. A few weeks later I receive an e-mail that simply says "you have not replied to your Razer support request" or something along the lines of. I was confused as within the e-mail there was no link quote or ANYTHING of a reply on Razer's behalf. Thankfully as this e-mail was received I mysteriously had no issues with my Naga Trinity. Very strange but it works now... however I'm anxious of my issues reappearing.Bad out of the way it's a comfortable mouse. It fits pretty well for my large hand though it could be bigger. I have had some issues where I accidentally hit buttons on the left side as the buttons don't have much resistance - with any of the three plates installed.All in all it's pretty good (now) but if you can get a Logitech G600 I would suggest you go for that as the G600 would contour to my hand much more nicely and the MMO buttons are quite resistant. Logitech's generally better in terms of tech support as well from my personal experience.
5,This yhing is pretty awesome. I use it for both playing video games and normal office work. The real defining quality is the ability to be able to switch out the magnetic sides as needed without having to much issue with it affecting how the mouse reacts to whatever your doing.My best example of this is i play both fps games and mmorpg games. Its an absolute must to have the 12 button side cover on during the mmorpg to make the skill activation easier than walking your keyboard constantly for all your skills. However this same feature does a disservice when your trying to play an fps because when your trying to flick your mouse around you end up mashing buttons you dont intend to etc. So instead of having the constant hassle you switch the side out with the 7 button side with a grip point center of it. The adjustable dpi is also glorious for all the same reasons as the sides. Its really just a mouse that's nice for the well rounded pc user.
2,The main feature I wanted from this mouse was it's on board profile memory saving and that does not work. The razer software just does not let you save a profile to the mouse the software is buggy and never gets updates. Also the mouse wheel has way to much tension on it and takes too much force to school that most of the time you end up clicking it.
2,To keep things short this mouse only has one benefit which is the 3 side panels and switching them out for different games. The side panels are all pretty underwhelming and buttons are cheap feeling though. The buttons are all too sensitive and will be easily mis-clicked. The 12 key side is the worst because you will constantly click keys accidentally while adjusting the mouse position since there is nowhere else to apply pressure to move it. The mouse itself feels weird to hold and just ergonomically off. Sorry to say but Razer Naga trinity kinda feels like your friend bragging about playing multiple sports and how he practices all the time for them and so on.. and then you go watch him play and you find out he pretty much sucks at all of them.. just a huge let down and you keep trying to be nice and hope it gets better.. but eventually the 2 star review has to come..For those looking for a good mouse for FPS games go with the Death Adder v2 way better feel and gets the job done right. For MMO players I'd recommend the Redragon M913 Impact because it has better 12 key side and a small ledge under your thumb to apply pressure for mouse adjustments. Plus the buttons are not as sensitive and are easy to destinguish between due to design such as a slight bar to feel for the 5 and 8 keys to reference without having to do extra feeling around in time sensitive moments. If anything else jus do not get this mouse and expect it to be the best version of the 3 mouse types... it is the worst of all of them. Hopefully I helped someone avoid my mistake buying this mouse and expecting too much.
5,After testing out multiple MMO gaming mouses all the way ranging from SteelSeries Corsair  Logitech to Razer.I can by far say that Razer knows what they are doing when it comes to gaming mouses.The Razer Trinity is a nice edition to the MMO mouse lineup.The Razer Trinity is very plug & play and you can re-keybind both DPI buttons to mouse 4 & Mouse 5 if needed.You can basically customize the Razer Trinity to however you want it configured when it comes to keybinding.The DPI speeds are solid and the laser reads very well on any surface.The Razer Trinity's scroll wheel does in fact move from side-to-side or press down when clicking on the wheel itself.This alone is a very good feature that if I recall they took out of other MMO mouse's.This is the only MMO mouse you need for MMO's... I've hit gladiator 8x on World of Warcraft using Razer MMO mouses for the longest time now.As long as you take care of the mouse and clean the mouse each month. It will last you for a VERY long time.As they say take care of your stuff and your stuff shall take care of you in return!If you've read this full review you know you want to pick one up and try it out!- Axxo
5,I love this mouse. I was a little skeptical about buying a Razer product because a few of my friends said they didn’t like theirs and they break but I do not regret buying this mouse at all. Great feel. The wire doesn’t really bother me because I don’t need to move my mouse so much when I play shooters and MMO’s but if you play on a mousepad that is extended and need all of that space to play (aka you swing your mouse all over the place) wired is probably not for you. The customization on the LEDs is super easy and so is customizing the macros. I changed mine to the function keys. I really love this mouse because it works for whatever game you play. If I want to play MMO’s I’ll use the 12 button side. If I want to play fps’s I’ll use the 7 button. There is also a two button side. These are very easy to change out. The lighting is really really cool. You can change the colors and effects for each part. I really love this mouse and would reccomend it. I am not sure what to say about durability yet but it seems like a great mouse so I am not worried about it.Update: two years later and still using this mouse
3,Bought this for MMO games. Works as you expect. extra button panels are cool would have been great if I was playing moba games still but maybe the next diablo will see some heavy use of the 6 button.the 12 button panel is pretty good but I wish it was a little more forward on the mouse. Also I always misclick buttons if I need to pick the mouse up because they press in too easy. If you keep the mouse flat always then it does well.  Id otherwise give it 5 stars.Battery I have a razer mouse dock and primarily use my razer basilisk ultimate(which I love) and just swap mice depending on the game. Each mouse has fantastic battery life but the basilisk definitely is the king for a long lasting daily use mouse. Because I have two mice that use the charging dock there is never a moment where im worried about battery life.RGB: turn that garbage off people. Better battery life less ugly light pollution.  but yes it has it. Id rather save a few fractions of a gram in weight than have rgb though.Weight: its a bit heavy fine for most things though. Not intended to be a FPS or lightweight mouse to whip around.
4,It's a good mouse except the right mouse button disengage and then reengage really quick randomly while I'm holding it down. I thought it was me at first but started noticing it happen when I knew for sure I had the button held firmly. Plus I'm always pressing the 1 button when I lift the mouse. Honestly my hands are probably too big for this mouse.
2,The Mouse looks feels and operates great!  But...I've now had four razer products fail between 11 and 14 months.  I am now recommending people not support their products.  I know they look great... but you'll have to buy another great looking product in about a year.  Spend your money elsewhere until this company decides to fix their quality.
5,Works just like I thought a Razer would. I use the 1-6 side button attachment. Perfect for me. Easy switch between the three. I completely recommend.
4,This is a great quality mouse but it you buy it for the purpose of remapping the buttons on the side you will be disappointed.This is my third mouse of this brand. With each this issue persist.While playing a game the button remappings can lag between 4-12 seconds. For example if "2" is set to "T" and you press "2" the game will not register "T" for 4-12 seconds.This is something that persisted after whipping and redownloading everything onto an ssd (including windows) buying 3 different identical mice and getting a new motherboard gpu cpu and ram.If you are buying this mouse to use the remapping on Fortnite I would buy with caution. Seems fine in every other game (League of legends Path of exile etc.).
3,The mouse is great. I like how it feels the size layout etc.My only issue and despite only having owned it for about 2-ish months now is that the mouse is already having issues registering clicks and button presses which can result in serious downtime/other-issues when I'm mid-session. It's mostly a problem with the side panel buttons not the primary two.
3,This was the biggest purchase I made for a mouse and my first wireless mouse to boot. Right out of the box it has a problem; there was an issue with the cursor. Quite frequently the cursor would stop and a moment later it would suddenly skip across the screen almost as if it tried to catch up with the mouse. It then would end up somewhere you didn't intend. You can imagine how terrible that is for gaming among other applications.It's a damn shame because I really like this mouse and its modular design. I likely got unlucky and received a defective product but in any case I was not happy with it so I returned it and ordered a different mouse instead. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 is because the customer support at least tried their best to help. They provided a lot of troubleshooting information but nothing was helpful.
2,So I was super excited to get this mouse as I like to have lots of macro buttons assigned for work. With the circular attachment my large hands have a clear spot to grip onto between the buttons. The software looked promising too as previous mice like this could only do 1 configuration.I bought this about 7 months ago and  wasn't long before I started having issues. I assumed it was with a bad install or left over drivers but after several clean installs I still have issues.First. the software requires a user account or guest account and needs to be logged in to utilize most of the features. like any aside from a few simple key binds like volume up/down or a single keybind you have to be logged in which it never stays logged in or after I got that to work still forgets half the macros I have assigned.  Plus is still shows that they aren't bound even though they are and I'm signed into Synergy. The software is not user friendly.Now the Biggest issue. The Left mouse button will NOT stay held down. Trying to select large bodies of text or drag & drop files which is essential for my job it will release halfway there and sometimes even select again a few times leading to files getting lost in sub-folders or text moved around to awkward spots. Searching for the issues shows this is a common problem for Razer Trinity and even razer mice in general. The recommended fix is to take the mouse apart and clean/adjust the copper spring thus voiding your warranty and guaranteeing you'll never get your bottom sticker pads back on right again.This is even suggested by users on Razer forums. I don't see any company feedback regarding the issue other than reinstalling the drivers which we've done several times.Do yourself a favor and go with another manufacturer.
4,About 6 months after using - the left mouse button intermittently "lets go" during a drag operation. This has become more and more of a problem recently. First noticed it when playing games (dragging items in my inventory - the mouse would randomly drop the item in unintended places). This issue has gotten worse and now shows up when dragging items in any application and also when attempting to select text by dragging. Sometimes it will not register the initial click-hold (when grabbing the item) and sometimes it will initially grab the item (or begin selecting the block of text) and randomly "let go" even though the left mouse button is still held/pressed. This is unusual for Razer in my past experience as I have never had an issue before with their products. Looking into my possible warranty options now. Except for this issue the mouse is exactly what I wanted. When it worked it worked great. Disappointed.
3,I have owned a Razor Naga Trinity for years and when the left button double clicked i bought the Razor Naga X and it does NOT feel right in my hand.They did  not include rubber for where the pinky rests and when i push one of the side buttons the whole mouse moves in my hand because there is not enough weight to it and is very slippery. I returned the X version for the Pro and am much happier now. Also Go buy some Razor Grip tape it is amazing for these mice.
1,This review is for Naga Pro Wireless Naga mouse.01-06-21 Update:After using 3 months I concluded this mouse is useless. Intermittent freezing is still remaining and now the latest Synapse 3 update caused a yellow bang on the device. I went back to Naga Trinity and everything is fine now. If you are a gamer and competing others don't buy Naga pro. I still use this for work but for online gamers no-no.10-11-20 Update:Finally found a solution for BT re-connect issue after sleep. If I press Profile button it brings back the mouse almost immediately. Still I don't understand why other buttons cannot reconnect the mouse but it got 4 stars now.In summary if you suffer intermittent freeze with 2.4GHz dongle try USB2 port and avoid USB3 ports. This solved the issue for me. Not sure this always solves the issue though.If you suffer BT reconnect issue after sleep try pressing Profile button on backside of the mouse.10-8-20 Update:Intermittent freeze issue with dongle was gone after moving to USB2 port on my gaming PC. Looks USB3 port was a problem. Changed rating to 3 starts.BT is still an issue but noticed it eventually comes back but the timing is very random. Sometimes it comes back within 10 seconds sometimes it takes more than a minute.Original post:This is a wonderful mouse if everything works. But unfortunately some quite annoying things happen to me.1. Mouse intermittently froze for a while and then started working.This happens with 2.4GHz dongle. No issues if the mouse is connected through a cable supplied. But hey why I bought this mouse? That is because of wireless. I don't use this mouse if I have to connect the cable.2. Mouse was lost and didn't reconnect with BT mode.I am using this mouse on my work PC as well with BT mode. If I leave and let the mouse goes into sleep mode it never comes back. I have to turn off the mouse and need to reconnect it. I checked all the possible BT connection thingy but nothing helps. To be honest this might be BT host side issue I am not sure. But have a quite negative feeling if you encounter this type of issue because other BT devices are working fine like keyboard and headset. The bad thing is no sleep mode option in Synapse so I cannot test my theory.3. Battery is gone too fast with LED ON.Make sure you turn off LED on the mouse. It drains the battery really quickly. Apparently 150 hours claim is based on with LED off.
5,I use my mouse to move around my big screen and type reports!! Love it!!
4,its super good for gaming if you like big mouse's i have the wired version so idk about the battery life but the 3 detachable side panels for thumb mouse button is actually insane i usually use just the normal 2 big buttons the most for fps and all 12 buttons for survival games but i dont really like the 7 button attachment as the grip is to small and it just feels weird in my hands and makes it somewhat hard to grip. other than that im glad i bought this mouse as it was a complete upgrade from my old mouse this was definitely the way to go.
2,Razer's always had both hardware and software ups and downs.  The h/w is in a down cycle.When scrolling the wheel quickly it sounds like it's going to fly off and break something.Tilting left is OK but right makes a wimpy click and doesn't always spring back all the way.First the right button began feel mushy and didn't click (sound-wise) as crisp and precise.  Now it doesn't always click.  Same is happening to the left.Side buttons can move slightly in all directions without clicking since I'm not trying to click it  but the wobbling is annoying and can cause the buttons to bind up.Trivial but WHY TF is there no bump on the 5 button?  Or any other for reference.My last Naga had a bunch of nice thick stickers I could use although they fell off in a heartbeat.I don't know why I keep buying Razer stuff.  The first mouse I got hosed my PC.  The driver kept insisting on phoning home but kept failing so I had to go through tons of hoops to even get to login.  But then it worked WRT remapping the keys.  The new S/W is better but still takes way too many clicks to do simple things like making the side '2' become 'x'.Also I don't think I've had one that has lasted over 2 years.  It seems like the main buttons completely fail first.The multiple side panels are cool and I've always wanted to try the oval one.  Too bad my thumbs are too stubby to reach all of them.  I did have to clean every single contact to get them to work.  Having the main feature not work when you first plug it in doesn't inspire confidence.  There was info on the web but it shouldn't be the first thing I have to do after the mouse is installed.I hope I have the packaging and I'm in the return window.
5,feels like the naga trinity but has a better 6 button thumb grid and is wireless so not much to really dislike.
5,I had the same mouse before this and This one is just about the same thing. It is a little heavier but I got use to it quickly.
5,So I waited a bit to make this review until I could use all three attachments. The one that I use most adds just the two extra buttons which I use for Push-to-talk in most games and quick melee instead of it being on the keyboard. The 1-6 radial is really nice for games like League of Legends and most MMOs (I use it most when I'm playing FFXIV) and the last one with the most buttons I would assume more competitive people would use I don't use it often and merely tried it out with League before switching to the 1-6.This mouse fits very nicely into my hand and I have large hands at 6'5 200-something lbs. Each attachment also fits very well the mouse clicks nicely and the attachments are magnetic and the switch is seamless even when in game. There's the classic RGB and profile settings you can expect with razer though I don't mess with those much as well as the mesh cable that's got really nice length to it. Honestly I don't have any qualms when it comes to this purchase and if you are an avid gamer who believes they could even use two out of the three peripherals for the mouse I'd definitely say go for it.
3,As much as I liked the mouse it personally felt too light for me. I used it for about a week before going back to my ACER Predator Cestus 350. Maybe it's just me but the Naga X worked well enough but it didn't quite feel right to me. Likely due to the decreased weight compared to other mice I have used over the years. It fit my hand well which is somewhat surprising since I feel like I have rather large hands. The little rest on the right side of the mouse felt weird and fairly unnatural when I use my thumb and pinky to grip the sides of mice move it forward and back and as a guide while my wrist moves the mouse side to side. Maybe it's just personal preference but unless Razer makes heavier mice or mice with adjustable weights I don't think I'll ever buy another one from them.
1,I purchased this mouse to replace a 10-year-old Logitech that was no longer produced. After 10 years I started getting ghosting in the left mouse button. I played a LOT of video games in that span.The right-click of this mouse started ghosting after about a year. The concept of the Trinity is cool and I wanted to like it. It could serve the function of several different types of mice from the thumb-keys for MMOs or the radial buttons or just the side grip. But this mouse is the jack of all trades and master of none.The radial buttons were the only ones I tried to use and they were so small that my large thumb couldn't differentiate the buttons well enough. So I used the default cover that's made of a soft-plastic/rubber material.The grooves caught any of that gamer dust and had to be cleaned frequently. (Chips sweat skin cells...just general grime that you find on any controller).The mouse wheel doesn't free-spin (which seems to be a staple for some games) and the DPI settings near the mouse wheel make for accidental changes frequently. I can't tell you how many times I went from 800 DPI to 4500 when I was trying to scroll quickly.This is the fourth Razer input device I've purchased and ghosting has always been what made me replace them. They last considerably shorter than any other peripheral I've owned. (I've owned 3 Razer headsets 2 mice and 2 keyboards now. None of them have lasted more than a couple years.)
1,Out of the box it requires synapse 3 to work. The mouse didnt install the drivers correctly so no big deal just uninstall and reinstall the product right? nope. It gave itself system permissions and even though im the admin. So to fix this I had to do a search for "RAZER' find all the files it downloaded associated with synapse hit properties hit security hit "owner" then hit "change" type in "Everyone" because inherent properties was greyed out then add myself permissions so that I could delete this trash software. Deleted every file and did a system restart. I go to their webpage and the product isnt listed under their driver support they have the RAZER PRO but not the RAZER NAGA X - two different softwares. So after removing and reinstalling this crap twice I still wasnt able to get this mouse to work properly.I do absolutely love the button design of the mouse and the way it fits my hand perfectly I bought it twice for this reason synapse issues on both devices getting them up and running on two separate systems was issues on both. I was able to get the first one running a year ago but the second go around with 3 hours of troubleshooting and an unresponsive 24/7 chat service I'm SOL this time around.It's a freaking mouse. It should be plug and play. I don't care for synapse or any of the extra forced light features.
5,Pretty awesome if you grab it on sale for $150 the dock is free!The mouse itself is really nice I didn't think I could like a design more than the original naga trinity and I was wrong it's lighter the texture on the grips is better the magnets hold better and the buttons are snappier. With optical switches I shouldn't fall victim to the dreaded double click razer mouses have had for years.Battery life is really good too I've been heavily gaming on it for 5 hours now and just hit 72%.The only issue I've seen so far is that sometimes if it goes into rest mode it has trouble reconnecting to razer synapse but turning it on and off seems to do the trick.
2,This is my second Razar Naga Pro mouse and both have had this issue where the mouse stutters and makes it completely unusable. I've tried contacting Razar support and they are not any help. Would not recommend.
4,the mouse was perfect for the first year but after that the left mouse button has been acting up and I've had to take it apart and adjust the spring at least once and I will have to do it again soon because the mouse button is again messing up less than 5 months later. (occasionally it will just click once or double click when i try to hold it down its very annoying if you are a gamer like me.)
5,Looks great feels great fantastic battery life the swappable plates are great for use in anything you could need not just gaming. More importantly it fits the palm of my hands more comfortably than any other mouse I’ve owned so no more arched fingers cramping up or the majority of my palm sitting on the desk/pad.
5,I bought this mouse to play mmo rpgs on my PC. The Naga has 15 keybinds available including the wheel and wheel tilt which is one of the most on the market. It is very comfortable and easy to use and makes gaming so much easier with that many keybinds. Not too heavy I have small hands and I can still comfortable fit to press each key easily with the curved design. Sometimes I have to quickly readjust my hand for side buttons 1 2 and 3 but it’s fast enough where you can think ahead and it won’t affect your gameplay. 5/5 stars for me.
4,It would be a 5 star for me if it had the mouse 4 & 5 buttons on the left side of mouse 1 (left click) like the older Molten Edition Naga. Other than that it is a great mouse! I have not had any issues yet and hopefully it will last a long time!
2,I may up my stars later after use but I bought a new mouse not used.  I just now received it and clearly it's been re-boxed.  Torn wrapping plastic protector not flush instruction papers misaligned and creased way too easy to pull apart the cardboard and plastic packaging.  Given that mice don't last very well (I'm on my third Naga HEX since 2012 it's acting wonky so I got the Trinity as a backup for when it fails since the HEX is no longer available) starting with one that someone already tested and returned (or was used as a store demo I don't know) is not pleasant.  Getting at the back of my computer isn't easy so I can't just casually test the Trinity.At least in shape and size it is functionally though not 100% identical to the HEX.  LMB and RMB are a bit wider and the palm/finger rest area is coarser feeling but the hand grip design and ring button layout are the same.  Though it fills my palm a little bit more hopefully not to the point of straining my small hand.The side button panels are super easy to swap out as they are magnetically held.  I may try out a 12 button layout at some point though lacking the rubber thumb grip spot might make that non-viable for me.  But hey I have it freely and quickly available and it could improve my MMO gaming once I learn it.  Assuming this mouse isn't defective of course.  No telling why someone unboxed it and then didn't keep it.  Yes I'm pretty miffed about that.
5,If you have macros you need to press easily buy this mouse. Setup the key binds for numpad and go to work.
3,i love the mouse i dislike amazon telling me its $50 bucks cheaper the day after i bought it
5,Highly customizable has multiple options for connection and it is comfortable to hold. Works great for gaming.
2,This mouse is definitely *not* for people who have hands on the smaller side of average. I don't have tiny hands by any means but this mouse is extremely awkward for me to use without accidentally hitting the first row of keys on the side. My hand simply doesn't wrap around enough of the bulk of this thing to get a good grip on only the non-button portions of the mouse. This leads to firing off skills or macros that I absolutely do not intend to use yet while just moving the mouse around; I've had to disable the first row of keys entirely to avoid this.Another problem the size presents is that it won't consistently hold down the LMB if I want to click and drag; it'll often let go prematurely because my fingertips apparently don't reach far enough forward to get the leverage it needs to keep the sensors in contact.Years ago I had a Naga that had plates you could swap out to adjust the size appropriate to your needs but they apparently don't make them anymore and are going with a "one (large) size fits all" approach. This is a major shame because it's excluding a fairly significant portion of the gaming population.If you have big ol' hands then I bet this mouse would work great for you. It's lightweight (almost too lightweight) and pretty responsive.
5,Bought an my naga mouse as a new product got the infamous double click from razers crappy quality after almost 2 months dealing with razer horrible rma process they tell me this was a refurbished mouse and not new so it dosnt qualify for any repair or replacement. Scammed by Amazon and razer!
3,The buttons will sometimes stop working. To fix it you have to reseat the button plate. Not fun during gameplay when this happens.
5,Prior to purchasing this mouse I had a Razer Naga Hex for several years which I used daily and traveled with often until it broke. I was excited to try out this new iteration and have zero regrets. This is the most comfortable mouse I've ever used: fabulously ergonomic with a balanced weight (solid but not heavy in the slightest) and a pleasantly textured exterior (for what it's worth I'm a woman with average-sized hands). The buttons feel much sturdier than on the original Hex and the plates could not possibly be simpler to change out (though I haven't felt the need to do so since unboxing if I'm being completely honest). Chroma is gorgeous and a lot brighter and more vibrant than I was expecting. The cord feels durable and is very light. The mouse is smooth and responsive. I don't have a single complaint with it! I can only hope it lasts even longer than its predecessor.
5,I've been using Razer mice for a few years now and have gone through three NAGA mice in almost as many years. They'd always had some minor problems but not enough for warranty service or for replacement within six months. I've been using this mouse for four or six months now and none of the previous issues have shown up thus far. The RGB behaves as it should even with the Synapse issues I've had with my keyboard all along. I have been using the round seven button side buttons almost exclusively so I've not used the replaceable side panels nearly as frequently as I expected that I would but it's nice to know that I won't be mouseless if the side buttons fail as they have in the past on my other NAGA mice and can just switch to the 12 button panel if necessary.
2,It's as if the ergonomics of this mouse was designed by someone who has never played a game.  They think all you want / need to do is lay your hand on top of the mouse and off you go.  As we all know that's not true.I came from the Naga Epic that had the replaceable side plate that was OPPOSITE the number pad.  This allowed for a palm grip a claw grip and a blended or neutral grip.  In addition the pressure required to depress the number buttons was substantially higher that what's found on this device.  That meant that you could pick up the mouse and relocate it on the pad without depressing the number buttons.THAT was smart design.  This one is the exact opposite of all that in every way.  You can't use a claw grip.  And if you try to force it you will often inadvertently depress a number button.  Oh and I'm getting the double clicks everyone else is complaining about.Go back to what works Razer and maybe I'll buy another one.  Until then this is going in the trash and I won't be buying another.  It's a little sad because all my other peripherals are Razer and they usually have smart design.  This team was asleep at the wheel.  You likely dropped the side plate options in the interest of cost and instead went with the swappable thumb pad.  But why not just release this mouse with the swappable side plate in three different versions each with a different thumb button layout?  I know inventory costs / parts / supply chain logistics.  The lesser of evils...  Think about it.
3,Pros:-fits a larger hand nicely-buttons switcheroo never gave me issues-razer program is pretty easy to use to fine tune aimCons:-Cord frayed fast-Clicking only lasted ~8 months-Sensor starting to go outSo this is my second Razer mouse with the same issue.  This one fit my hand oh so well and provided great grip.  I enjoyed the ability to switch out the buttons on the side to fit the game I was playing.My problem:Both of my Razer mice have had the same issue.  About 8 months in I start losing clicks. About a year in and my left click specifically will just not work right.  It will register the press down as one at the beginning of the press and another click on release but it will fail to register the hold.Now the first mouse was an old Naga and I abused that one for a few years before that happened.  That one had the laser go out first so sometimes I would be unable to aim or use it for a few seconds while it reset itself. I decided to stick it out initially with this mouse to see if it was a software bug or something that would get patched.  Well no luck there so on to another mouse.
5,My HEXv2 was dying on me and I couldn't find one at a reasonable price. I ended up buying this one to replace my old one and its really nice. Like having three mice in one.The side plates are easily removed and can be hotswapped making going from game to game a breeze.
5,It works well. Battery lasts all day. It also works with 3rd party charging stands. The software doesn't like when it's plugged into a USB hub. I have it plugged into a USB hub and then USB switch. It took a few days for the software to finally detect the mouse but it's all working now.
5,Good for games that can utilize the extra buttons. Makes activating abilities and what not easier with this highly customizable mouse. You can program pretty much and keyboard mouse function or complex macro with this mouse using the Razer Synapse software.Speaking of software one of the downsides is that you need Razer Synapse 3 to actually customize this mouse which is unfortunate to those already used to and using Synapse 2.Ergonomically this mouse is a little awkward to handle at least I thought so. For those not used to MMO mice. It's also quite heavy. For me personally it took a good while to get used to using it with how it's shaped and how heavy it is at over 100 grams.Build quality is great structurally sound and the mouse cable is a nice flexible braided cable. Clicks feel good and responsive. The mouse wheel is quite loud and harsh which could be a negative or a positive for some.I don't know what else there is to say about it but yeah A good mouse 8/10.
4,Excellent laser let me start there before I say anything else! I also feel like the mouse fits my insanely large gorilla hands pretty well. I have gone through several Corsair/Logitech mice and just couldn't fine one that was comfortable in my hand this fit the bill.As for the Synapse that I have heard mixed reviews on I guess it depends on what you are using it to accomplish. I am using the 7 button side setup and found it quite easy to setup and bind for most games and programs.Pros:Great feel in handGreat laserFeels sturdyCons:Quality control - the heel (back) of the mouse where the two plastic pieces meet one was hanging low and actually catching the mouse pad I had to file it down. Also the top of the mouse was a little scuffed due to shipping packaging rubbing on the mouse. I wouldn't have sent it back over these minor issues but look for them yourself and decide.
5,Changing the side plate is a snap literally. You use a fingernail to remove one and the next one lightly snaps on with the rare earth magnets that hold it to the mouse. The synapse software to program the mouse is easy to use and quite intuitive. The mouse is responsive and quick. No negatives through several weeks of use. Pair it with a Razer Tartarus and you won't be disappointed.
2,I paid an embarrassing amount of money to buy this mouse (because shipping and fees are expensive on my country) the mouse is pretty good and the buttons are easily customizable with the razer synapse v3 app I couldn't be happier with this purchase... Until the end of september . I bought this mouse on June 27 and only 3 months in the "12" button in the side panel stopped working out of nowhere the button just doesn't show up anything even if I press hard I have tried doing a factory reset using the mouse on different computers but nothing fixed the problem the button just stopped working pretty bad for an expensive piece of plastic but anyway i still used the mouse because the other 11 buttons still worked without problem... But some days later the "3" button also stopped working same problem with 12 and now that was a bigger problem because I used that button a lot for games and for productivity. Few days later the "6"button also started malfunctioning it won't work unless I press it hard which makes the button completely useless for gaming. 80 Dollars wasted on a mouse and 3 buttons stopped working never buying razer again.
5,got to play wow god i love wow
5,Easy to setup/use works great and is comforable to use!
5,My first one seemed to have a bad middle mouse button. I tried but couldn’t fix it. Second one was the same. The problem was the default settings for middle mouse left and right were to continue the middle scroll. That messed Deep Rock Galactic up so bad the mouse was useless. After changing the default mapping I love this thing!
3,I previously owned a Razer Naga Epic for about a decade and was happy if not mildly frustrated with it. Being able to change out the grip allowed someone with big hands like me to grip the mouse comfortably even after long hours of gaming. However the horrendous battery life & terrible way it handled recharging eventually turned it into a permanent wired mouse.While the battery life of the Naga Pro is much better I won't be able to fully test it. The lack of grip adjustments weight adjustments & buggy software that actually overrode my keyboard so I couldn't log into without physically disconnecting the unit is quite honestly something I cannot accept from a $150 mouse. The ability to swap the button  hardware on the fly is the coolest thing I've ever seen in a mouse but the complete lack of care for the fundamentals of design for the sake of flashy features is a problematic choice that I feel embodies Razer's design ethos across the board.
2,I upgraded to this mouse from a Utechsmart Venus (wired) hoping for a high quality wireless replacement with the same functionality. What I got was that but with a few problems. My hand measures only 7.25" from middle finger to wrist but I find this mouse very uncomfortable to use in general. The side buttons aren't quite accessible without switching to a finger-tip grip in which case the right-hand side of the mouse juts out and digs into my hand in between my ring and pinky finger joints as I try to hold it in place. I think the width is the main issue. While it is largely functional for a while the software had issues resulting in some of the side buttons failing randomly. Thankfully this seems to have stopped after about 2 months of use.On the plus side the quality of the mouse is excellent. The feedback for both mouse1 and mouse2 are quite nice even after 6 months of 8-12 hours of use a day. The side buttons also offer a satisfying response and do not seem to absorb any amount of oil from my skin. The battery life is considerable and I find myself getting about 2-3 days of use out of one charge and it isn't at all inconvenient to use while charging because of how lightweight and durable the charging cable is.I would not buy this mouse again myself and will be searching for a replacement to save my hand from further torment.
1,This is my 5th Naga. The original was amazing and changed my gaming life forever.They do however have some qc issues and only last roughly a year or two before needing to be replaced. I have never been able to use any other mice after getting used to this numpad so I buy a back up so it's ready to go when my current one finally fails. I learned from that terrible mistake.Every single one I have owned has either had the right click completely die from excessive aiming down the sights or began naggingly double clicking everytime I tried to single click.Almost every new naga I have had has made some alteration to the model but were all generally good quality before failing and felt similar.This new Trinity model however feels like a cheap 3rd world knock off. The first thing I noticed was how creaky and hollow it feels just picking it up in your hand. I feel like I could crush it easily like an oversized egg. I can't stress enough how loud it is. The mouse wheel roll sound is atrocious and reminds me of cans dragging behind the vehicle of a couple just married. The overall sound plastic feel and clicking is monstrous... In a bad way.But with as little ranting and rambling as possible the worse part of this mouse and the complete joy killer for me is the super sensitivity of the buttons on the side. They just feel loose and sloppy. There older model was more firm.I was fully capable of picking up and repositioning the older models I've had without pressing any of the buttons on accident. It took extra pressure to push them. The buttons are soo sensitive on this model that I can barely set my thumb on them at rest without accidently pressing them.Even worse this is the bulkiest version yet making avoiding the buttons by altering your grip pretty much impossible. Any angle or tilt I use places my thumb on the 1 and 2 button.Making these buttons soo sensitive destroys the utility of the mouse for me. Destroys it entirely in fact.I can't play a game like this especially when it counts without accidently triggering my most importantly positioned abilities on accident during a heated situation.Pos door stop.I'm going to go look at my return options.
5,I replaced the wired version of the mouse due to the left click going out which seemed to be a common problem.  Mouse works great but you need to watch out for interference.  I had my internet box behind my monitor and seeing as how the mouse runs on 2.4 ghz (also Bluetooth but you can notice the delay) there were many times the mouse would just flat out loss signal.  Finally moved stuff around and got the net away from my PC not a single issue or disconnect with the mouse.  I think Razer finally got a good wireless mouse going for them.  We will see how long the left click lasts though.
4,I have to say this is a great mouse if you want more side buttons its super responsive and comfortable but iv tried all of the new wireless razor mouses and this is the worst one in the wireless department it has a horrible stutter problem when wireless which goes away white the cable connected. Its the only flaw the mouse has but i still give it a solid 4/5.
2,If you game a lot the battery life on this mouse will drive you crazy. A mouse at this price should be able to have a much better life on a cycle. It says its good for 50 hours but there is no way that is true. Besides 50 hours isn't even good. I can go a full week or even two and never have to charge my G915 Keyboard but this mouse is good for a day at best. Typical Razer quality
4,I’ve always loved the naga gaming mice but they seem to always come with minor issues. This recent model I purchased suffers from double clicking issues (clicking the mouse buttons once but getting two click commands)  which isn’t noticeable or present most of the time but when it does happen it’s SUPER ANNOYING. Other than that the ergonomics of this mouse is amazing it fits pretty well in my hands. The switchable side panels is a pretty cool feature although I just prefer to have the num pad on it.Pros:-ergonomics-interchangeable buttons-high quality materials and rgb lightsCons:-double clicking issue is sometimes unbearable-tends to have tracking issues later in its lifespan
5,Excelente producto y entrega super inmediata en menor tiempo del indicado
1,I've used Razer products for years. I bought my first Naga in 2009 and used it for almost a year before I stepped on it (don't ask) and had to replace it. It had no problems at all other than me breaking it. I bought another one in 2010 and it lasted 3 years before button 4 started going bad. No big deal; it lasted much longer than I expected. I bought the Naga Molten Special Edition in late 2013 and it lasted years without issue. Again button 4 or 5 stopped working.Here's where everything started going down hill fast. I replaced the mouse with the Razer Nage Epic Chroma wireless mouse in 2015. The design was changed for the worse. It was also clunky and not super responsive. It stopped holding a charge after 1 month so I had to keep it plugged in. I absolutely hated it. I ended up trying 2 other brands the same year but they just couldn't hold a candle to the quality of the Razer products I used in the past.I ended up buying another Razer Naga (wired this time) later in 2015 even though I hated the new design. It broke within a year. The mouse wheel stopped working at all. In 2016 I bought an identical mouse chalking it up to bad luck. This one also broke within a year. The dreaded double click bug struck for the first time in my experience. I replaced the mouse again in 2017 with an identical model. Lasted just over a year and the double click bug hit again. 2018 and 2019 were the same with the mice lasting under a year before the double click bug.I purchased the new Razer Trinity in May 2020 hoping that the new design would end the bugginess I've experienced over the past few years with Razer Mice. The bug appeared worse than ever less than 2 months later and I'm beyond frustrated.I've been loyal for over 10 years. I've never asked for refunds or any kind of compensation because of the top tier quality I got out of Razer mice from 2009-2015. It makes me sad to say this but unless some drastic quality improvements are made I will NEVER purchase another product from Razer again. Enough is enough.Do not waste your time or your money on this mouse.Received the mouse on May 21 2020. W
2,Interest and requirement: I only use one mouse for work and gaming (coding and shooting); my hands are about eight inches long (tip of middle to wrist).Pros: feels responsive except for slight jitter (according to rtings.com click latency is ~ 6 ms but I suspect some serious variance behind the averages); feels fairly sturdy for a mouse with a swappable side panel and lateral wheel gestures; subdued clicks; thumb buttons on the Standard side panel (two buttons no light) are mostly out of the way for palm and claw grip.Cons: barely counts as a medium-sized mouse despite large hump for palm/claw grip; all weight at back not suited for quick repositioning; sensor forward of neutral/poor natural sweeps; very poor lift-off calibration; color settings do not save to mouse at all - requires Synapse software running to maintain color settings at all times consuming between three and four hundred megabytes of memory; and the other two button-laden side panels offer no place to put a normal-sized thumb without pressing buttons.My take: at an absolute bare minimum for one hundred dollars profiles stored to the mouse itself should include color settings and not require garbage software chewing resources at all times; and each of the three attachments should have a place for one's thumb.Final thoughts: if your hands are fairly small and all of your games are MMOs where the convenience of the extra buttons outweighs having a decent place to put your thumb AND you don't care about the color scheme or the running software required to maintain it AND you are in fact MINTED this mouse might be okay for you.
5,I really like its smooth and non slip technology. I always change between all three side panels and am always able to go on its software to calibrate it to feel just right. I have really small hands so its bulkiness doesn't really do me justice but nonetheless I still recommend it!
5,It can be customized to fit your preferred usage.
5,Great I use it because I have cerebral palsy and some keys are hard to use when playing games so the mouse helps
5,The versatility alone makes this worth a buy. I play all kinds of games and being able to switch out the side for different button inputs is amazing. I never have a problem with the batter always making sure to charge it when I sleep. The wireless signal is never a problem because my headset plugs into my mic. These 3 things makes this mouse the perfect one for me. It feels great in my hand and I love the lighting on it.
5,Been using a RAZER Naga since 2004. It takes some training to get used to the side buttons. Once you have trained your hand to find the buttons you have the entire first layer of your attack buttons directly on your mouse. The new Trinity combines the original 12 side button array with the 7 button array and a standard 2 button side panel. There is no way this isn't the MMO mouse of everyone's dreams. Think 12 buttons is confusing? Snap the 12 button panel off and put the 7 button panel on. Still too many buttons? Snap the 7 button panel off and snap the standard 2 button panel on. When I combined the Trinity with the new improved Vespula pad I found my targeting and attack speed was plainly improved.  In case I forgot to tell you I use my Naga Trinity LEFT HANDED. That means the side buttons are pressed with my left pinky finger.
3,I’ve been a razer naga user for a long time and thought I’d upgrade to the pro version for 2 reasons 1. For the ability to change the led color and 2. For the ability to reduce cord clutter and go wireless. The pro fit the bill for number 1 but it did not perform well for number 2. Using it wireless I immediately noticed that it wasn’t very responsive and I’d even say it stutters for lack of a better word. I plugged the usb back up (wired) and it operated perfectly. It’s a great mouse for gaming and general use while connected with the usb cable but for me wireless mode is horrible.
5,Buying the Naga Trinity is a great convenience to anyone's set up. Before I bought this mouse I owned the Razer DeathAdder Elite 2013 and it fit perfectly in my hand but I didn't have enough buttons and all it would flash is green. After getting this mouse it fits better with my hand with Razer putting a pinkie rest on the side of the mouse and the Chroma feature on this product is amazing. For this product though you have to download the Razer Synapse 3.0 (BETA) for you to control DPI settings and color settings.The DPI settings are great you can set your "stages" of DPI and the Chroma settings are simple and easy to use. The only problem with the mouse is getting use to the multiple buttons. Also if you use 1-0 on your keyboard it will act as if you are pressing your keyboard. The number 10 is 0 11 is - and 12 is =. Other than that it is a great mouse and it is super easy to change the side plates. Overall it is a great product and I would 100% recommend it for people looking for a affordable gaming mouse.
1,So first off to give you a background of myself I've worked in the IT field as a Systems Administrator Engineer and Lead for over 20 years now.  I'm also overseas at the moment and it takes a long time for me to receive mail as you can imagine...  So yeah it really really sucks for me when I don't have a working mouse.I've been using Razer products for at least 10 years now and this particular mouse model (Naga Trinity) for three years now.  I replace all of my peripherals with a new one just about every year give or take.  This is because I'm a heavy gamer and computer user so my mouse keyboard headset etc go bad fairly quickly.Unfortunately the new mouse I received was borked up somehow but I haven't been able to figure out what is wrong with it.  Everything worked fine at first but then a couple of hours into it one or multiple buttons randomly switch to something else.  Sometimes it's just a simple switch like the #6 thumb button switches to the 'J' key or the 'Y' key or something else but then sometimes it'll switch to something else and rapidly press the button over and over again forcing me to hard power off my computer.As far as troubleshooting steps I've taken:- I've changed mouse profiles (Same problem occurs)- I've checked to make sure I have no macros that run on my computer.- I've tried it on two different computers (Same problem)- I've unplugged the mouse uninstalled the drivers uninstalled Synapse3 rebooted installed Synapse3 rebooted plugged the mouse in again.  (This is a common step because Razer software is notoriously some of if not thee absolute worst in the industry and when replacing Razer hardware this frequently solves the problem)Anyway needless to say...  I'm stuck at the moment and need a mouse so here I am ordering another one.  I really CANNOT wait until EVGA's X15 comes out.  I'm so sick of crappy Razer products and I really want to just drop their garbage hardware and software permanently.
2,I've used the Razer Naga Hex mouse ever since the original so when my Hex had started to show its age a bit I purchased this new generation. Sad to say it's been a complete disappointment as an evolution of the model as well as containing poor quality parts (as attested by all the counts of double-clicking issues).My mouse started having the double-click issue only after a couple of months. I switched back to my old Razer Naga until it finally broke recently. Went back to this one making sure to clean the L/R buttons as best as possible but I still experience the double-click issue very regularly.One other issue I have is that I find the 7 button circle layout much less satisfying than the older 6 button circle. The lack of symmetry just makes hitting the buttons much less intuitive and takes more effort to build muscle memory in order to properly hit the correct button.This mouse is a step down in every way from the older Naga Hex. I hope Razer considers bringing back the older style in the future as I won't ever be buying this one again.
4,Mouse has been flawless up until the forward side mouse button on the 2 button started sticking/get debris under it and now it's not that satisfying clicky sound
5,I wish everything I bought held up this well I have only used the 12 button plate but recently found the need to return to using it just for internet searches (I'm over 60 and the ol' hands hurt a bit) so the 2 button plate will see some use.I get teased a little about my gaming PC being my adult day care.  I just reply: Best one there is!But this mouse has been a real pleasure to use on a Corsair 10"x14" hard mouse pad.Just 'cus I am old doesn't mean I lack accuracy.From one good sniper to another...  This is a good one get it.
4,This is my favorite mouse for gaming.  I have tried using others like it and have always come back to the naga.  Side buttons have always worked great.  First naga was replaced due to a double click issue on the left click.  Second naga was replaced due to the middle mouse button "p2t" stopped working.  Third Naga is being replaced due to right mouse click going out.  Like everyone else its going out wile playing wow.  This is an amazing mouse but be prepared to replace it in under 2 years.
2,I love mmo mouses. I also loved the original Naga mouse which I owned for a solid 4 years before it went bad. I WANT to love the Trinity. However I started having issues 6 months into owning it and these issues keep presenting themselves a year and a half later.Simply put having 3 plates doesn't do this mouse any favors. You tend to prefer 1 of the 3 and never change out most of the time. However since it's a removable part dust or bad connections start to occur and you will find 60% of your buttons just randomly stopped working.And I don't know how to quite prove this point but something just doesn't feel precise about mouse movements. I use photoshop a lot and when I need to make very tiny moves or adjustments I just feel like this mouse doesn't handle it well even after trying to adjust mouse settings.So yes for gaming it's (hypothetically) been fantastic! Ergonomics Razer does well! Battery Life? Okay it's wired what do you expect? But even after all of that I'm gonna have to score it like a 2 or 3 by virtue of bad manufacture quality consistency being prone to really dumb errors and just generally being MASSIVELY inferior to its earlier iteration. If Razer re-did their first generation Naga I'd throw my Trinity away in a heartbeat and go back!
3,This mouse was such a genius idea and I love it but it's a shame that it doesn't last all that well...Pros: It feels super nice! I love the way my hand rests on it and the fact that you can change the side buttons between different formats is plain awesome! Now the razer logo on the back actually light up (FINALLY!!!) of course it's useless when using it but it's still super cool! It's very responsive the weight feels nice and doesn't restrict my movement. It's an overall perfect mouse... if it wasn't so cheap...Cons: I use drag and dropping A LOT!! And this mouse in only the span of 7 months started double clicking it's frustrating and a huge problem to me I hate it. The side buttons sometimes don't work? I tried swapping the buttons on the mouse and once I was in game I realized some of them didnt register any input you have to re-place the buttons again and check if they work and that is a huge annoyance...This mouse has an amazing idea but the execution was poor it's a shame. I wished it had better materials so it could last longer than 7 months...
3,I love this mouse.... until the double click issue. essentially holding down the left mouse button will with increasing frequency release and reclick. so while your holding down the left button it will double click for you. this has signfiicant impacts on gaming and work. dragging windows highlighting cells scrolling becomes a huge issue. Someone said they took theirs apart and fixed the spring themselves. I may try this down the road. ... oh god. the rewiring.... .......
1,I whole heartedly regret the purchase of this device if Amazon or Razer would refund at this point I'd take it and throw the mouse in the garbage. Since the launch of this product issues with micro-stuttering occurs when using this device with and without razer synapse. This even happens across multiple devices and in different work environments.Sadly these issues became worse as time has passed and with  new versions of Razer Synapse that corrupted a driver in the mouse. Unfortunately their support was absolutely useless and wanted to RMA the mouse for the driver issue. As someone who has worked in Software Engineering this is silly. Drivers are software and most mice when connected via USB can update any corruption via a firmware update if it is not bricked. The mouse is not bricked.Here are more issues as per myself and others:Random stutters from being in wireless or Bluetooth modeThis was not resolved by firmware update to the mouseNew- Error Code 10 on HID Compliant Mouse DriverTested on 4 devices that have latest Synapse 3 update (I think it was pushed week of Dec 25th)Each device had the error codeOn Each device the mouse became extremely unusable in any wireless modeSupport wants to RMA because "Corrupted Driver"Drivers are software a new mouse will just result in the issue reoccurring.RMA process is slow and doesn't advance shipment.No Guarantee on a fixMassive Battery Drain with RGBLowering the lighting to minimal brightness seems to consume a similar amount of power as full brightnessMouse wheel issues? (Not happened to me but I've seen it.)Mouse Click not registered (Not happening to me but I've seen a post about it.)This mouse essentially has been flawed from launch and it makes me a bit annoyed that we as customers essentially have obtained no support for a mouse that costs well over 150 USD. Support needs to acknowledge the issue and let us know when a fix can be expected. Otherwise we need refunds as the device is not functioning as a wireless mouse.
1,Do yourself a favor do NOT buy any Razer products if you want to save yourself the hassle of attempting to deal with customer service.Less than 10 months into owning this mouse I began having signal issues. Researched around a bit and found a firmware update (from Razers website) that listed it fixed signal issues. I updated with said firmware and the mouse bricked itself. Upon Googling around a bit apparently Razer ends up having to send you a new mouse.Fine I tell myself. This company stands by its products lets get the ball rolling. Thats where the useless customer service comes in. Not only is it hard to even find a direct link to a customer service rep/line/chat they force you to speak to a "bot" with prompts.I provided proof of purchase 3-4 times I deleted installed drivers on the PC and reinstalled the Synapse software (which is terribly programmed fyi) that is installed in 3-5 different file locations. I also had to show them where I found the firmware because apparently bootleg firmware must be a frequent issue for them (red flag number 3 by this point). After all of this they STILL did not submit my request for a repair/warranty of the mouse. They also want you to send them a video of your broken mouse in this case they wanted me to prove that it was indeed not working. By this point I had been without a mouse for 5+ days.I was never offered a chance to mail it in a replacement or even offered any sort of help outside of "give me more proof" over and over again.I gave up threw the mouse and the charging dock into the trash. I should have know better than to fall for the Razer is "good now" meme. Save yourself some time and hassle and go with another company.
2,I bought this mouse mid June of 2020 and it worked great for the first few months nothing major to complain about really. Fits well in my hand and does what's advertised.However the problem came around October. I started noticing some odd miss clicks on my mouse and when I swap the side cover out (Very rarely do I ever do this since I usually stick with the 12 button panel) I noticed that it wasn't "connecting" properly. Some buttons would work but after taking it off and reattaching it it would be fine. Fast forward a few months to this review late November. The left click has deteriorated greatly.. Note I don't do anything intensive in terms of clicking the games I play are BDO and occasionally Genshin Impact. Nothing crazy there like league/dota. The left click would sometime respond and holding it down for a hard click with fail or it would flicker as if I'm double clicking rapidly. Something like that would be expected in an older mouse but this one from the warehouse didn't last half a year so I am a bit disappointed there.Basically the reason I am writing this review is to point out some potential longevity issue in design? The mouse I had previously was a 2012 Razer Naga which is this models predecessor and that one lasted me 7+ years. Given the benefit of the doubt I might have gotten the "bad" one in the batch but I'll have to warn those who are looking for a new mouse to look into the longevity of the product just in case.
5,I have used multiple razer Logitech and other mice. This is by far my favorite mouse. The weight width and button options are amazing.
3,As I use it through the day it will often freeze and not respond for 2-3 seconds. Earthshattering? no. But deadly in a FPS game and irritating when working. Can be overcome by keeping it plugged in but then that defeats the purpose in wireless no?
4,Works well even with some raging slam down on my mousepad. Only loses stars because it is extremely heavy. It's heft makes it uncomfortable to use for long periods unless you have larger hands.
3,Diseño cómodo y mucho mejor que el naga trinity en cuanto al posicionamiento de los botones solo de vez en cuando tengo problemas con la estabilidad de la conexión entre el usb y el mouse y constantemente deja de aparecer en el Razer Synapse ( tengo una laptop de Razer y técnicamente no debería haber fallas en cuanto a la conectividad y pues el chroma studio es tedioso de personalizar cuando se deja de reconocer ).
5,I don' think I've ever had a better mouse in my life! I love all of the options for customization it feels like I have so much control when I'm playing competitive games. and it has the option to be wired but the wireless works perfectly and I feel like there's so much freedom of movement without a wired connection.
1,My general experienceIt was an excellent product for like a week. Almost immediately I notice a problem with some lateral buttons specific button 6 when you use the lateral 6 button layout. If I use the 12 layout I have the bug in the button 2. Apparently anything clicking in the mid/lower left area of the lateral panel triggers the problem.What is the issue? infinite click. It is as if I keep clicking the same button permanently. To get rid of it I need to click another lateral button. I don't know if it is a software or hardware issue. Sadly for me I was so happy with it in the first week that I bought 2 mouses. The infinite clicking bug is present in both so it could be a fabric issue.Sadly in my experience always Razer with its products disappoint after a brief period of usage at least with respect to mouses this is my fifth Razer mouse....there is always an issue.SummaryWhat was good?Really light quite ergonomic nice software for customization.What is the bad?This annoying lateral infinite click.
4,I dislike the 7 button layout because 1 - 3 is clockwise 4 - 7 starts counter clockwise at the bottom next to 1.The 12 button layout isn't so great as 1 - 3 requires repositioning of the hand if your thumb is short.
5,Second time buying this mouse after the other one gave out. Very good long lasting mouse. Handy for MMOs. Would recommend :)
5,I have used this mouse for about a month now and I have really enjoyed it. The interchangeable thumb buttons are a great idea. The software is easy to use to rekey buttons and I switch between different profiles a lot as well without issues.
4,As always Razer delivers exactly what anyone looking at these expects. A great mouse at a great price that will most likely last for 2 years.It however does not feel the same as the older Naga's that didn't have the interchangeable side buttons. Which was a little disappointing. But I am already getting used to the new feel.
4,This mouse is comfortable to hold though somewhat heavy. However I do have pretty small hands for an adult. The macros take some work to get set up but once you do they'll do what you need.However the bloatware leaves a lot to be desired. Runs in the background taking up a lot of ram with something they claim is supposed to conserve resources... yeah right.
2,The mouse feels pretty good. The sides switch easy. Unfortunately some of the buttons on the side will randomly stop responding. Sometimes if I quickly take off the side panel and put it back on it will work but only half the time. Not reliable for gaming. Have to return it
3,So my wife has had this mouse for a year now. I have the left-handed version (they don't make the extra interchange plates for that one)  While we still use them we also don't like them because they are too wide and hurt our hands after half an hour or so... save some money get a different mouse and maybe try a gaming keypad... I'd love to try one of those but Razer doesn't cater to the left handed population.
1,Let me introduce myself I have used Nagas since 2013 (In the good days when there were no swappable panels) and am a huge fan of the Razer Naga line of products. I use the 12 key panel.I bought this mouse to replace my Naga Trinity and for the novelty of it being wireless. The 2.4 Gz connection works okay and I have noticed some latency. Battery life is great and the weight is decent for the larger design.However there are major issues. The 12 key side buttons will not actuate if pressed too fast or at less than perfect angles. There are times when you need to roll your thumb to press keys in a certain order and often times the action will not happen.Another issue I have is with the Right/Left click. They click really mushy and not crisp almost like a layer of paper is stuck in between the switches.  I do not know if this issue is due to the new optical mouse switches or a quality issue.Lastly the swappable panel design is inconvenient. What is the point of including 2 extra side panels without a case to put them in? I have had issues with my trinity side panel contacts not connecting and it has happened within the first two days of owning the Pro model. Having to take it off and clean the contacts fixes it but that shouldn't be an issue in the first place.I find myself plugging my Naga trinity back to play often now as it is less fatiguing to use overall.Razer please. Make a wireless Naga without putting in weird optical switches in everything and no swappable side panels. The top DPI buttons need to stick out more the recessed nature of the new design makes it harder to utilize. For $150 I'd also expect a dock to go with my very expensive WIRELESS mouse.Give us a Razer Naga Epic 2021. literally just take the Naga epic and give it Razer 2.4gz Hyperspeed and call it a day.Hugely disappointed. I am returning this mouse and will probably pick up a backup Naga Trinity.
1,***** My left mouse click is suffering from a problem common to this mouse.  It will lose the mouse hold down function and also will randomly double click when you click only once.  I would not recommend buying this product at all after researching this problem and discovering how many people have this issue.Once razer was great.  I have an older version naga a man o war headset and orbweaver... then I got the razer leviathan (no razer software support - that's sold separately) and a razer panthera (no software support and had to download the stand alone driver instead of that being done by synapse.)Which brings me to this new mouse i purchased to replace the previous razer naga I owned:Pros: Much more ergonomic than the previous versions as the buttons align with the thumb and have different angles that make hitting the extra buttons much easier.Cons:1.) The mouse feels to be made of cheaper materials than previous naga versions.2.) This mouse uses Razer Synapse 3 ... which has been in beta for over 10yrs and still lacks a ton of functionality compared to Synapse 2.  Mainly it does not have extra keymap tab that allowed you to create up to 8 different keymaps per a profile.  Which I used to create a profile for 1 game and then different keymaps for all my other characters and / or different playstyles for that game.  With Razer Synapse 3 you have to make a profile for each individual keymap - making organization almost impossible as you're creating a hundred files.  Switching between these profiles is made even more difficult since you cannot change their arrangement as to where on the profile list they appear and are organized in order of newest to last created profile.If you're using this mouse as just a mouse then you should be fine.  But since you are most likely buying this mouse for the multiple button feature be warned the razer software will be a nightmare.  Razer Synapse 3 is more focused on lightning options than utilizing the functionality of the products that use it.As for me this is the last razer product I'm purchasing.
3,I got this as a gift for my husband and my husband does game but he also does a lot of work on his computer. The mouse is perfect for gaming no issues. But for some reason when he is just working and using it casually it will glitch out and stop working to the point of having to restart it.
2,button 1 of the 12 side buttons after couple days has already become hard to use...all the other 11 buttons you barely press and they work no problem but button 1 which is a button i use alot as a gamer has already become hard to use...you have to press it very hard and correct way or it just doesnt read it...and again as a Gamer it is very ANNOYING..that is why i am giving such low rateing if this issue happens to be resolved then i will change that but as of right now being a gamer its a major downfall when a button doesnt work correctly especially when that is the reason you bought it is for the buttons....so when the button dont work correctly it defeats the purpose of buying it....i will add it is made in taiwan...which in my opion is better then china but apperently the material and quality is still not so great...other then the 1 button it works great...maybe im unlucky and just got a faulty 12 button keypad attachment i dkn... it does come with 2 other attachments but i have no use for them since they use less numbers..and whole point is to have max numbers at thumb reach.... what would be really great is if the seller would give me a new keypad attachment that has a non faulty button...but i wont get my hopes up on that one...so anyone buying this mouse just be watchful of your button 1 mainly but keep an eye on all of the buttons...im sure mine isnt the only one that has had this issue.....
1,The side button panel on this mouse is severely bugged. About half the time I try to use this mouse the side buttons are unresponsive. Sometimes all of them sometimes just a few of them. Restarting Razer Synapse will solve the problem sometimes otherwise a computer restart is required. Sometimes plugging the mouse in and out will fix the problem.There seems to be no specific trigger and it's very frustrating. I owned a Corsair Scimitar before this and HIGHLY suggest that one over the Naga Pro. It's simply a better product. It's extremely annoying spending >$100 on a mouse specifically designed to gamers yet a simple feature that's been around for 20 years they cannot get right. Do not spend this amount of money on a bugged mouse - Razer does not deserve your business.
5,I love the overall feel of this mouse. It is responsive ergonomic and laid out very nicely. I have been using this mouse for a few weeks now. I use it for gaming in the evenings and at work during the day. I work in HR so macros help me tremendously. I switched over after my equally priced Corsair mouse stopped right clicking after 6 months and they refused to fix it. It was an amazing switch. It did take time to get used to a slightly different shape and click feel but it is time well spent. The only downside to it (user preference stemming from using the Corsair mouse) is that the right side grip is not modular. The side grip feels great but I prefer to have a full sized pinky rest. Other than that I can't think of a single bad thing about this mouse.The software is easy to use. I have been using a Razer keyboard for years now and the mouse is easily integrated into my current themes. Setting up macros is much more intuitive than the process used by Corsair.Great mouse! Would recommend to anyone.
5,I have a macbook running Sierra - this works great! The software can be a bit of a nuissance but updating permissions to include it for input generally works. You do need to have an account to use the software which to me is odd you actually need to *login* to the software - on your own computer.But all the other reviews are on the money. One wish list: change profiles to the mouse with a keyboard shortcut. I don't want to login the app every time I want to change a setting on the mouse. Sometimes I like them on sometimes off.Thanks!
2,TLDR- Sensor works well while gaming- Grip is comfortable- its feels cheaper seem to have made compromises to fit the panals- Synapse 3 is awful (can't use synapse 2)- Since its early in the cycle higher chance of getting a defective model (I received a defective unit)- Razer personally replaced my defective unit even though i live outside their delivery areas---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Let me start by saying I have been using Razer products for several years now but I have been very disappointed in the quality in the past few years. I have used the Razer Naga for 8 years and also used several of Razer headphones the only issue I have ever had with Razer products are the weak wiring in their devices which usually stops working in 1.5 - 2 years.I bought two Razer Naga Trinity but when they arrived I realized one of them was defective (more on that later).Lets begin by reviewing the one that works properly. The mouse comes with the same specs as its predecessor so I wont be covering that in the review.My first impressions:- Nice finish on the surface- Comfortable grip- Side panels are almost the same as Razer Naga Hex Deathadder- Sensors seem to work well- The mouse felt like it was made from cheap plastic.- The side panels no longer seem to use a mechanical thumb grip (seems like a step backwards).- The mouse comes with Razer synapse 3 the program seems to have missing/removed important features and has a lot of bugs. I understand the program is still in beta but if you buy this mouse you are forced to use it.- USB is no longer gold plated.- Seems to get hotter compared to the Naga 2014.Regarding the defective unit The scroll wheel seem to be lose so whenever you use the scroll it keeps bouncing up and down (makes it unbearable to use). The two main mouse buttons require significantly more force to activate making it terrible for gaming. I realized these defects when comparing the two mouse.Unfortunately for me (since I ordered them internationally) It would cost me more than the mouse to send it back to amazon so I contacted Razer customer support and they were very helpful they replaced my mouse and payed for the shipping even though i live outside of razer stores delivery locations I really appreciate that.The product is still in it were early stages and seems to have a lot of problems higher chance to get a defected product.
3,Terrible software that makes using it without an account unnecessarily difficult.  Seems to reset your configurations on software updates despite having on-board configuration memory.Also the key binding functionality is riddled with bugs that makes the process frustrating beyond belief.  These bugs include making buttons randomly un-bindable (despite having the functionality moments before) and also a complete lack of ability to clear binds that you have made.
5,Using this mouse for a few months now I can confidently say that this is the mouse that suites my needs for gaming. This mouse has a very smooth feel on your hand and also virtually!  This mouse is very adaptable by giving you three separate attachments. Upon trying all three I personally can not use two of them due to how I play. This is not a Con these attachments give a sense of security as they can have different purposes! Adding to the adaptability this mouse can go up to 16000 DPI. Overall I would highly recommend this mouse to an experienced gamer and even a new-comer!
4,i love this mouse real well made and super customizable only sad part is the side buttons of the wheel modular i usually use had the pain rub nearly complely off but hay still works perfectly
1,The side plates are soo annoying when the mouse falls and you are on the internet its premapped to back button so guess what you went back a page. the number of times these side plates have been thrown across the room. Surprising the side plate is still in one piece. The other 2 option side plates have been thoroughly snapped in half as the button are toooo easily pressed. If there was a way to disable to mapping to the side plate button on the desktop then my rating would be different. I found to bend the metal sensors in the side plate section is a good way to disable the side plate.
2,Most expensive WIRED mouse I ever got. I have to leave the cable connected 100% of the time.This mouse will not stay connected to windows. all you hear is the USB connected / disconnected windows sound. You can not play a game unless it is plugged in. With it plugged in it's great but I bought it for the wireless feature and spent the extra $50 for the dock that I can't use. Very disappointing.
5,This mouse pretty much as everything covered. If you play fps you get mouse 4 & 5 keys. If you play ARPGs/MOBAs you get number keys 1-8. Also if you play MMORPGs you get number keys 1-12 so this mouse pretty much has everything covered. I'm about a medium sized guy with average hands and I believe the mouse fits all sizes but be prepared to use learn new muscle memory groups when it comes to this mouse as since you'll be using your thumb for keys as well you'll need to adapt to new mouse movements.
3,Mouse worked great side plates are nice but after a little over a year I started having problems with right-clicking. I'll get occasional extra double-clicks and holding right-click and dragging is a spotty venture at best and that's apparently a problem that develops with some regularity on newer razer mice from what I've seen while looking around for solutions.
3,I seriously love the design of this mouse. The circular button option has straight up changed how i game in many games especially MMO's but I've run into the double click issue after one year so it's now a debate if i want to buy another or not.Also I would LOVE to get the Pro wireless version but they dropped the one button side panel that I use serious bummer. They have a really good thing going with this changeable side buttons and it would really be cool to see them grow those options.At this point I'd only suggest this mouse to people with the understanding that you'll have a really good mouse for about a year. If you're not looking to have to replace it every year then might want to look elsewhere.I've owned a lot of Razor products and always love their design but they always end up failing after about a year regardless of what the item is. Headsets keyboard mice.It's about time to move on for me.
1,After less than a year of use the left mouse button double clicks and releases and clicks all the time. It never goes away. I have kept it clean and don't excessively click it.This is totally unacceptable on this product. You buy the switchable sides for long life the build quality of the cable is so that it lasts. Everything else about this including the price is a design that will supposedly last. Many other Razer products have held up very well. But this will be my second Naga mouse in just a couple of years due to the same issue.I can't highlight and edit text I can't play games I can barely operate the computer. It has caused me to make purchases I didn't want and crashes applications and pages by clicking too fast. This is garbage and it has the shortest lifespan of all mice that I have ever used. It's a real disappointment.I should add this is not the only button issue on this mouse. It is the most severe and now prevents use but it has 2 small buttons on the top default used to increase or decrease DPI. The decrease button always stuck for me it would do the same thing double click or not register a click 80% of the time. Made the whole feature useless I had to set the max DPI setting the the one I like the most since I effectively could not change it.I'm sick to death of spending a lot on mice that only last a few months to a year when my work laptop has been using the same $8 mouse from Staples for 10 years. We are being ripped off. Do not buy.
5,I upgraded my previous Razer Naga Pro wireless mouse from years ago and I am pleasantly surprised. It's so much lighter and more responsive then it's predecessor. The battery life is 100x better as well. I love how I can change out the side plates to what meets my needs. The RGB is insane!!!! It's so bright and vibrant!!! I highly recommend this mouse for any gamers out there!
2,I had the original Razer Naga for maybe 8 or 9 years and it was a great mouse and I became very accustomed to it.  When that broke I obviously wanted the same one but of course it was out of production and "newer and better one" was available.That led to this purchase. Within 6 months of purchase it started getting the right click cutting out issue so in games or applications that require holding right click it would cut out randomly and sometimes very quickly so for example in a shooting game you generally use right click to hold zoom.  This mouse rendered zooming in games pointless.  Same in any design application that requires holding right click to create a bounding box same issue.Given Razer is a big company with great service I contact support.  After a few back and forths including a video of the issue they RMA it for service.  Fast forward a few weeks and I have a brand new mouse like in the box with the accessories and everything new mouse.  I was initially excited because I get to start over but within 4 months of that replacement the issue returned.I gave up with support because now I'm outside of the 1 year warranty and it seems the issue is so widespread I'll get referred back to buy another.I wish there were a better mmo mouse since I've grown accustomed to the style but I gone from a multi-Razer mouse household to telling friends to avoid before they even spend the money.If you're going to get this buy an extended warranty you'll likely need it.
3,Decided to upgrade to this mouse after 10 years of owning the Razer Naga(2009). Even though it has been 11 years since the first in the series many of the physical design changes negatively effect my ability to use the mouse to the point where I'm considering a return.For starters the mouse is very slippery. The shape is the main issue it is a fairly wide mouse that slopes outward in all the areas where my fingers rest. The texture is also working against you it has as matte finish that imo provide zero grip whatsoever. Combine this with the fact that the numpad buttons are very light to press means it is very difficult to grip and lift the mouse without miss-clicking a number/macro.I do have smaller hands so that is probably a factor in ergonomics but the buttons are so light I can barely recommend them for their main purpose.
5,I love that you can just swap out the keypad inserts on the fly.  They are simply held on by magnets.  So if you are playing an mmo and want to go back to normal use just swap keypads.  No need to unplug or reboot or make any changes to your software settings.My only small gripe is that it isn't easy to lift the mouse off the surface so if you are that type of gamer this may not be the best mouse for you.  I don't  really game that way so it's not much of an issue.
1,I got the Naga X. Unfortunately for the past 2-3 weeks it's been disconnecting every few minutes whenever I try to use it.I've reinstalled Synapse 3 the mouse drivers updated numerous things rolled back numerous things. I tried different USB ports. Alas I tried the mouse on my laptop (probably should've done this first but hindsight is 20/20) and it didn't work there either. The problem is the mouse.Finally today it gave up the ghost. I was trying to enjoy Valheim's new update. Instead the mouse completely ceased to work. It lights up when plugged in... But that's it. Neither my gaming computer or my laptop recognize the mouse. It's dead to me and my devices.I'm not even sure it's worth trying to go through customer support for this mouse- I've only heard negative things about trying to get repairs or replacements. My time is worth more than the frustration of trying to contact someone over a crappy dead mouse who will probably tell me to reinstall Synapse 3 again for the 100th time then hang up.Get the Logitech G600 if you're looking for lots of buttons. It's rather large (I have tiny hands) it's heavy and it's harder to actuate the buttons... But at least it's reliable and will last a long time. I'm sorry G600 please take me back. I've realized the error of my ways.I originally got the Naga X because I struggle with thumb dislocations. I thought the easier-to-push buttons would help during prolonged gaming/drawing/writing/etc sessions. The buttons were definitely easier to use ergonomically and actuation-wise. But I'm not going to fork over that much money every 2-2.5 months for an essentially disposable mouse. That's just a rip-off.
3,This mouse tends to have a really bad issue with lag. It worked extremely well when I first got it but for some reason their firmware or options introduced stutter into the performance. The mouse will do a full 2-3 second delay sometimes. I'm big on pvp so that doesn't fit my agenda right.It's a great mouse though besides that highly recommend for MMOs and just really daily use.
1,This mouse is no where near as good as the original model I have now gone through 2 of these in less then 2 years. This one broke when it started to discount and reconnect from my PC constantly even when it was wired into my PC it still did it. It has major issues with the removable side panels one didn't work at all the second one the RGB did not work at all but the 12 button one worked fine. Overall when it worked it was a great mouse great for MMORPG and shooter games it felt great weight wise and size wise.
4,The mouse itself it great. Synapse on the other hand some sections are a bit laggy. Mouse wheel scroll down speed is not adjustable. No backspace key on left click compared to my old mouse. Though it does need getting used to. Overall it's great. Here's to hoping that mouse lasts for a while since a lot of people seem to be getting the mouse double clicking after a month to three month of use.
5,This is by far the best Nage mouse I've used I've been using Razer Naga mouses for some years and this one has the best quality in construction as well as responsiveness from the Software.I've not used too much the Wireless options but at least I can say that the Bluetooth is very responsive.I use this for productivity more than for games and the flexibility you've got with this mouse is great it lets you map almost all keystrokes you can imagine and can be combined with other automation software as well to do complex macros.
5,12 side buttons and software perfect for MMOs. Smooth to use.
5,I decided to treat myself to a mouse upgrade with some spare money this year for my birthday - I'd been using an older 3200 DPI Blackweb mouse with two programmable side buttons since 2014!The packaging was very sleek and I had no trouble getting into it there no waste attached to the mouse and an easily reusable rubber/plastic wire wrap and USB cap. The side plates are easy to swap out and are very satisfying to do so thanks to the magnetic components. The software used to program the mouse was a quick download and install and is very easy to understand and put to use.The buttons are easy to press and very responsive and the ability to reprogram them is an absolute godsend. I can't wait to start using while playing FFXIV!
2,I upgraded from the Naga Chroma (2014 model) to the Trinity. I loved the feel kind of a in between the original style but bigger and comfortable. Being able to change out the side if I am playing different games is nice as well.My only issue like the original Naga that came out way back when is that this mouse also has the miss click issue. You can be pressing the right mouse button down and it doesn't register or as you are holding it down it goes in and out of registering the click. It gets frustrating to the point where I wanted to throw the mouse at the ground and call it a day.Unfortunately like most things concerning electronics I am out of the warranty period by a few of months when the issue started happening. As long as the 2014 model I have lasts I will use that but next MMO mouse I get will sadly NOT be a razer mouse. I do like them but I just can't stand the lack of trust in their mice. Seeing as I had bought 4 of them and 3 out of the 4 have had the same clicking issue.So if you don't mind spending the money for a new Razer mouse every year it's a nice mouse! If you're like me and expect to last a few years and not just one pass on this and find something more reliable.
5,Okay I have a regular mechanical mouse that's only 3000dpi (its old i know)I purchased this as i wanted something to have for FPS and MMORPG gaming. (i've been in gaming since before the internet)I haven't plugged it in yet and sat down to configure everything but my first initial reaction is this is a nice mouse.It has a comfortable feel to it even for someone with large hands like mine. I would only add a thumb rest (my old mouse has one and its awesome) that is my only critique so far. it looks and feels sturdy though and the button presses (playing with it unplugged on my kitchen table) feel quick and fast. I currently have the MMORPG plate installed with the 12 buttons.  Solid 4.9/5 stars from me at this time. (Razer add a thumb rest lol)I will add more to this review once I am using it for gaming.
3,I have been using this mouse for about 3 months now. I really like being able to swap out the 12 button pad to a traditional pad with 2 buttons. This allows me to use it for multiples types of games without having to switch mice. The big issue I ran into with the mouse however is the double clicking issue. For the first 2 months is was a perfect mouse. After that I noticed during some games it would double click from only pressing one click. If I were to hold down on the click it would register as one click. Then when I released it would register as another. This issue drove me nuts. From online I read that blowing into the clicking portion would fix the issue. Weirdly it did however it kept coming back after some use. It got to the point where blowing into it would not fix the issue either. This seems to be a fundamental issue with the design of the mouse itself. If the double clicking was not and issue it would be a perfect mouse and would definitely recommend it. However this is the fastest I ran into an issue with a mouse after purchase. I would not recommend this and would recommend and older naga mouse or the death adder.
4,I picked up this mouse when WoW classic came out as I needed more hotkey binds. This mouse does everything I need it to for sure my only gripe is that the keypad is tied to the numbers on the keyboard. So you have to download the GUI for the thing then you can program it how you like it. It's pretty easy to learn even though it might look intimidating. Outside of the programming aspect of it the mouse is pretty rad and I am happy I got it on sale because the thing is expensive for sure. Also very comfortable if you don't kung-fu grip it like me during pvp.
3,I wanted this mouse to work since I started playing MMOs again after getting away from FPS for a bit. It seemed really cool to be able to swap between the side panels and adjust the amount of buttons but honestly I should have paid more attention to the reviews saying it's not for average or larger hands. I have a palm grip with only a slightly above average hand size and it is not comfortable at all. Tried to make it work for about 6 months switching between the side panels but the lack of ergo combined with the short battery life really just don't really get it done for me.
5,After my Roccat died (only had it for 9 months too) I decided to give the Naga Trinity a shot. This unit is perfect for PC gaming or general surfing. The 3 interchangeable (and hot swappable) side panels cover about everything you'd need for your current activities. ALL buttons are configurable via Synapse 3 and the best part is that the profiles are stored both on board and in the cloud. I used the Naga at home then I'd take it to work and change the panel for macros to use there. After forgetting to bring it home a couple times I decided to get a second Trinity. It's just that good.
3,There is a major design flaw that makes it so that this mouse can only be charged with the microUSB cable that is provided.There a tiny slot that the cable fits in to charge. But only the cable they provided can fit. I tried to use three other microUSB cables to charge the mouse and none of them fit because they made these plastic strips inside the gap so that no other cable can be used. (See picture)This means that if the charging cable ever breaks the mouse can no longer be charged. Was this was done on purpose so that you have to spend $150 every year or so to replace the entire mouse? Who knows. But it's a really dumb design.
3,These mice have a common problem where your single clicks will register as a double click.  It seems to be an issue with the microswitch itself and not firmware.  Mine lasted quite a while before this issue developed but I've read reports of others having this problem within just a couple months of ownership.I generally like razer products but I'll be replacing this mouse with another brand until I hear better things about their quality control.
5,I bought this mouse for gaming and work and adding the 'infinite scroll' option to the mouse wheel would make it God tier.  A few extra complaints would be the connection between the base and side panel plates and the software (Synapse 3) learning curve.Wiping both the connectors with a finger before connecting to the mouse base seems to really help.  I have the trinity mouse and the black widow elite pro keyboard and they work very well together.  The software takes some time to figure out but overall a huge step up from the average computer experience.
2,The only reason I bought this ( a second one) is within a short period of time the original one died and there is no other brand substitute for the 7 button on the side and my wife loves that configuration for Valheim. Within a short period of time the left mouse button stopped functioning correctly and it made playing with it unusable as she would click hold and it would not hold anymore. Would work with just plain click but as we know that is not how it should work.
1,I've had this mouse for a few months and I hadn't had any issue other than forgetting to charge it at night. Until today about Five months later the mouse in wireless 2.4GHz mode would stop working every few seconds for a second. this essentially prevents me from using it for its purpose WIRELESS GAMING. Even as I type this up and have to click around it would bug out and freeze thinking I am long pressing the mouse button and dragging the text or highlight box around.Plugging into the wire works but I didn't spend extra money just to have a wired mouse.
2,First time I got this mouse in the mail I was kind of confused. It was visibly used and the stickers to seal the box were clearly peeled and then put back. Not a good sign. Opened it up tried it for a bit I assumed I got a returned mouse someone didn't want so ill see if it will work for me. Then I tried the wireless mode and it was obvious the sensor was skipping all over the place and barely worked. Shipped this one back and got a replacement I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. Then when I got the new one in the mail today the box had already been cut open the mouse packaging had almost fallen out of the inside box and it not only looked like someone had used this mouse but someone beat it up bad. Several pieces were missing from the box and the mouse looked like I could be the THIRD owner of it. Immediately returned it I'm just gonna go buy one from Best Buy I guess. These are the first issues I've ever had with Amazon directly it may not be like this for everyone but it happened enough for me to mention it in a review. If you plan on buying the razer naga pro on amazon don't be surprised if it seems slightly used.
4,1) What I don't like:First would have to be how my hand lays on the mouse. It took me a while to get used to the fact that my ring finger was on the mouse. I kept wanting to click with it for some reason.2) What I do like:I love the fact you can save several different modes in the mouse. Being able to change the button configuration to fit different programs is very helpful. I use this with my modeling programs and I will never go back to using a mouse that doesn't let me have these options. Being able to bind the undo shift key or map anything else is amazing. It makes editing and modeling so much faster.I have had it for a month now so only time will tell if the build quality holds up.
5,works as intended...
4,This is probably the best right out of the box. especially with the usb. blazing fast. if you update the firmware IT WILL BURN OUT THE LITTLE 2.3GH USB ADAPTER. then youll be stuck with bluetooth. still fast just not as.
4,Love the mouse the only thing broken is the left click... Which I like to bind to a side button anyway so no complaints. The mouse came fast it was clean I just have to give a 5 star rating on the principal of the left click not working and not being explicitly told that it didn't work.
4,if the middle mouse buttons were programable like the last model it would be 5 star 10/10 would marry BUT it isnt so i just dont use this mouse.
4,I like the shape and weight of the mouse I mostly use it for MMOs my only complaint is that with the 12 button panel the middle row seems to stop working randomly until you pull off the panel and put it back on. After doing this a few times the issue seems to be less frequent but still very frustrating when it does occurs.
3,So mouse has worked ok for the past few months but in comparison to the former naga this this trinity is a piece of garbage. I have had this mouse for 6 months and it is already having click issues.The first naga I had lasted 3 years second naga lasted 2 year now this one purchased on October 13 2019 at only 6 months and I'm already having left click button switch issues. Sometimes it just releases and double clicks making some normal operations like drag and drop impossible. such as i would like to move an item from my inventory and equip whats that on the ground oh the item I was moving......@razor Your price has gone up your quality has gone down and I'm very much interested in an alternative products that are not your brand. Bring back your original design that lasted me 3 years get rid of your stupid poorly coded memory hog software synapse 3 and learn that KISS (keep it simple stupid) is a good practice. I like your ideas as far as the interchangeable button sets quite literally hate everything else.
5,I was always the person who said Razer was overpriced. I got talked into a keyboard from Razer and fell in love. My old mouse was starting to go(maybe I’m making that up ) so I dropped nearly 100$ on this one.I am avidly a believer in Razer. It took me awhile to get used to the mouse. Felt weird and was WAY different from my other one. It took many a game of League for this to click with me so to speak.Mouse is wonderful and I’ll buy another in a few years when this one kicks the bucket. It’s very very customizable with Razer Synapse. Color? Check. Dpi? Check. (Like literally any number you want up to 16000) 2/7/12 buttons? Check!
5,I have been using a Logitech G600 to play Elder Scrolls Online for like 6 months now. I always though certain spells wouldn't fire off due to my aim or that my mount would not launch because I was running. I WAS WRONG! Oh for the love of Bezos (hallowed be thy name) was I wrong . I started using the Razer Naga and within 5 minutes it was a total game changer. The side buttons ACTUALLY WORK! Spells fire when they are supposed to targeting actually hits things it is amazing! The Logitech G600 IS TRASH if you use one buy a Naga then set the Logitech on fire (safely in a well ventilated area). Nuff Said
5,The trinity is good but if you are buying it just to use the interchangeable side with the buttons I would not buy this product. If you have the side with buttons piece attached then the mouse isn't sufficient. Razor can do a better job with the quality. The other 2 side pieces are great because you can actually grab onto the mouse but when the side button piece the whole mouse becomes slick therefore it keeps slipping. I play World of Warcraft and I would not recommend this mouse for MMORPG's. Other than the side button piece the ergonomics are amazing and good if you have bigger hands and the customization is great.
4,This is the 2nd razer I have ever purchased. My first on was the Razer Naga. I love the circular feel as I am a gamer who only needs specific macro'ed keys. However one of the most common issues I had and found it has is the lighting feature. It took a few hours over the course of 2 days to get the lighting feature to work. But once I finally got it going it hasn't stopped and looks amazing! Perfect for those with smaller hands and works Amazing for gaming. I do have to say I think the very simple removal and how they just snap into place is Amazing! However again that is where the problem is. The connection isn't always strong enough and you have to go through some annoying steps to get it working sound. But I am very happy overall with this mouse!
5,I bought this mouse in November of 2018 and I am pleased to say it is still going strong and works like it is brand new straight out of the box. It is a little large for me but a good wrist rest and I am comfortable gaming for long spans. I appreciate the different thumb panels though I do use the 12 key one the most just out of habit. I game for anywhere from 10-20 hours a week sometimes significantly more and this mouse has never once given me even the slightest problem. Hoping it will last for many many more hours more.Updating this in Sept 2021 that this review still holds true for me and despite several recent drops it still works great.
5,Came no problem last time but this time I bought it as a gift for my brother and the box came damaged. Package had a hole like either someone looked in or more like it was stabbed through during shipping given the box was damaged too.
5,This mouse feels amazing in the hand. I like the adjustable DPI settings along with the addition of chroma RGB for all my RGB needs. The interchangeable side plates are also a great addition for all my gaming needs. 10/10
2,After burning through three Corsair mice in 4 years (and my wife burning through 2 in the same time frame) we opted to go over to Razer and hope for some longevity.  While the mouse wasn't the perfect size for me as the Corsair had been it was easy enough to use and very responsive.The mouse was ordered at the end of August.  It's Mid December and the scroll wheel has already broken.  It clicks down and left and right but the scrolling function has ceased.  Standard trouble shooting was conducted - scroll lock toggled on and off as needed changed USB ports cleaned the wheel as best as able checked for software updates closed Synapse restarted Synapse restarted the tower full power cycle to no avail.A replacement request has been made to Razer.  This review will be updated accordingly once I've heard back.
5,I bought this as an upgrade from my Red Dragon mmo mouse so I am familiar with 12 key side mice and have been using them for years.This mouse has blown everything out of the water unlike my other mouse the software immediately installed upon plugging in to my desktop. After a restart I was able to change any setting to my liking and it had already synced with the lighting active on my PC.Razer Synapse is a fantastic macro and binding software and really highlights the experience of this mouse. The interchangeable side plate is also a huge bonus though I have not changed my side plate yet.Not much more needs to be said this mouse is all you’ll ever need!
1,This mouse was great for just over a month right after the 30 day return window was up. The little magnetic panel on the side that has all the programmable buttons quickly becomes loose and is a coin toss as to whether it registers you pushing a button. At first I could hold the panel down with the meat of my thumb to get it to register the buttons I push but now that doesn’t work. The rapidity of deterioration of this mouse is something I would expect from a $20 Chinese knockoff not a high end model of what used to be a respectable name in gaming industry. Do yourselves a favor and stick with Logitech a brand that delivers what you pay for.
5,When I first saw the product I was worried about the interchangeable pieces and how they would wear out if I were to change them too much. I was still wondering whether the grip was firm enough for me to smash the buttons in the middle of a game session. Turns out the pieces haven't worn out whatsoever in over a year and the grip is literally seamless to the hand. One can think all modules are just stuck in the mouse with no interchangeability options. Recommended for people that play a different variety of games which needs different adaptation needs.
4,Works great for my gaming and non-gaming needs. I have on a Macbook Pro 2015.  This mouse and all the interchangeable plates ARE compatible on Mac. Before I bought this mouse I called Razor to confirm and support said I needed to download Synapse 2. Did that and everything works perfectly. In case it matters I play via Shadow: Ark Guild Wars and 7 Days to Die.  One concern I had was me having small hands (I'm a girl) - if the mouse would be too bulky. It's not! I don't have any issue reaching any of the buttons on the interchangeable plates. If anything having a smaller hand might make it easier. The reason I gave it 4-stars is because of the price.
1,it has literally no grip the rubber on the right side can't grip the pinky finger enough it's so smooth that it's basically slipping. not only that but over all for the rest of the mouse it's hard to hold and grip when I try to lift it it straight up slips from my hand or almost falls out often i end up accidently pressing one of the side buttons trying to compensate for it's awful ability to be handled by trying to tighten the grip on all sides which hardly helps it's driving me insane.this means that when playing games or doing just about anything with the mouse it's hard and problematic because the mouse straight up fights against your control and use of it by default of it's design.fixes? fairly easy actually design rubber with actual grip to it and add rubber grip to places where it would be beneficial where there is only blank smooth plastic that is doing nothing for the mouse by being blank smooth plastic..position for the rubber grip?  first upgrade the preexisting pinky finger rubber grip and make it actually gripping and expand it to go slightly longer around the mouse add rubber gripping to the area where the ring finger holds the mouse add rubbing gripping to the spot on the mouse button attachments where the thumb wraps around and one last spot I can think of is to add rubber gripping somewhere within the palm area that holds the mouse.there now I made my honest constructive criticism review do what you will with this information but for now I'll just have to suffer through this mouse until i get a different one or an upgraded replacement comes into existence..
5,I bought this mouse to pair with a razer keyboard I had recently bought. When I first started using it I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. It's lighter than my previous mouse's & it's a bit smaller too. But after playing with it for about an hour I was in love before I even realized it. My game performance had improved it was more comfortable with my wrist & maybe best of all it works in conjunction with my keyboard because of the razer app. I don't use the other 2 side panels as much as I'd like but that's only because the default one is so convenient. I'm incredibly happy with this mouse & I'd  buy it again in a heartbeat.
2,I bought this mouse specifically because I liked the idea of hot swappable side panels and Razer's implementation seemed to be the best. I had previously been using a Logitech Proteus Core without issues.Other than the size being a little small for my hands the mouse itself is great. The durability is a little bit worrisome as the right mouse button which I use often has already required some contact maintenance.The only gripe I've had with the hardware itself is I've rarely had cases where the side panel will stop working and it'll need to be reseated a few times before it's back.But then there's Synapse. The UI is dubiously unresponsive crashes inconsistently & wants a constant connection to the internet (for game specific lighting).Turning Synapse off is almost a solution except when that happens sometimes the mouse will just... die for a few seconds. This doesn't occur when Synapse is on.During some games (Stellaris) the mouse will unload itself and all devices from Mumble (Discord too). This will prevent  hotkeys from working(won't even be able to assign them) till a restart of the App or sometimes the PC.How do I know it's the mouse? Well it doesn't happen with my previous mouse (Logitech Proteus Core). I'd also like to add that if you don't want Logitech's app on constantly in the background for whatever reason their mice work just fine.All in all if you can work with Synapse which admittedly I can most of the time the mouse is great. Then again the most important thing about a mouse for me is it's unfailing reliability which Razer does not deliver. So my next mouse definitely won't be one of their products.
5,I had the original Razer Naga and when the Trinity came out I was SOO tempted to get it because I absolutely LOVE the ability to switch between the key sets. The only gripe I had with it was that I mostly use the 12-key configuration. Since I already had the Naga and what I *really* wanted was the ability to have the 12-key configuration be wireless. Then this same out. Oh my gosh I love it! It's wireless has a great battery life and has my favorite configuration AND it's swappable for when I don't want to be gaming? I'm never looking back!
3,Great hand feel and heavier than the deathadder but it only lasted 2 years til the mouse showed signs of clicks not working
5,I bought this mouse primarily to play classic WOW but I liked it so much I bought a second one for work. The level of configurability of the buttons is great from one button WOW attack rotations to mapping a button to key combinations for work tasks (lock screen show desktop show task view etc.. ) it is a nice simple addition.Also while it feels weird at first the ring finger support is a nice touch for comfort once you get used to it.Build quality is also good its easy to change out the side vuttons but I have never had the side panel come loose or diaconnect short of dropping it on the floor (which it survived just sent the side button panel skittering a couple feet away).
3,This mouse is great when I'm on Windows but Razer has not updated their OSX software in YEARS in spite of claiming that it's compatible in the documentation linked from this exact listing. It's very frustrating since I use a Macbook Pro for work that I plug into my desktop monitor and mouse/keyboard. I've come to rely on the thumb buttons over the years of using various Naga mice and this just completely breaks my experience and my workflow/productivity. Please Razer update your software; at least get Synapse 2 working on recent OSXes since it seems to just need some minor permissions-related fixes in order to work (it does sometimes work but then breaks which is super frustrating in itself - I've given up on it and just use the back/forward insert when on OSX).
3,You will love the mouse and you will hate the software and support. Be prepared to have issues.
3,while on the wireless dongle it seems to lag on initial movements of the mouse.
5,DO NOT get the Razer Naga X. It is lacking 2 buttons on the wheel and the Razer logo does not light up. The trinity has more buttons and can also switch easily on button layout from MMO to FPS to Moba in the matter of seconds. It is also 10 dollars cheaper than the X so this is way worth your money. I don't know what Razer was thinking making the X but get the Trinity instead because it is 10 dollars cheaper and has more features.
5,It was a gift and looks like he really likes it
5,Very good mouse easy to change the side panel comfortbale and precise. Changes colors too. The review asks me about battery life but this is a wired mouse so N/A.
5,I don't have a lot of experience using gaming mice but I can certainly notice the difference in weight (Heavier than expected) and width (Wider than expected) particularly on the right side of the mouse.  Too things I expect I'll get accustomed to after more use.  Overall though great buy! It has the additional buttons I was looking for and the Razer Synapse software makes it easy to configure the button functions to my liking.  My only issue at this point is having too many options haha.
4,Overall this is very good. It has two small issues that I've noticed. First it occasionally stops detecting inputs from the detachable section. Removing and replacing clears it up for awhile but it eventually comes back. Second the 10-12 keys on the number pad are quite far back and difficult to hit without looking at them.
2,I care enough to write this review - this mouse is appealing to me because I like to play FPS and MMO games and the sides can change my buttons.  THE ONLY PLUS TO THIS MOUSE! - I started noticing issues in an MMO where when you hold down right click and when you press left click your character can move.  This is important so i can use keybinded abilities instead of WASD to move.  The the left click glitches out some times and it will start and stop my character.  I tested this in a FPS and noticed when I am holding down left click to fire I will some times stop in spurts.  If you look at the mouse the button has TOO MUCH space between the chassis left/right button and I think debri can get trapped in there EASILY.  My issue was interrmittent so I thought I cleaned it properly/updated software replugged in different usb.  Contacted support knowing it was going to suck explaining this to try to get replacement... it ended after he suggested I clean it more.  :/ I have had this mouse less than a year at this point.  I keep it fairly clean already.  Never had this issue with any other mouse.  I don't recommend.
1,I normally don't leave reviews save for the stars but this product from Razer really disappointed me. I've only had this mouse for about 6 weeks and it's already double-clicking / not registering clicks sometimes. I only say 6 weeks because I've about had it with the double-clicking and unregistered clicks so the time frame was probably less than that before it went downhill. In reality it was probably around the 4-5 week mark. I figured it was just the placement of my finger because I sometimes drift upwards towards the center of the mouse due to my smaller hand and fingers but confirmed it was actually the mouse itself with software that can show clicks. It's a shame because prior to this mouse I was using a Chroma which lasted me somewhere in the ballpark of 3-4 years before it finally started to double-click constantly.A couple other major drawbacks of this product is that the mouse is definitely heavier than what I was used to. I could feel the fatigue in my wrist after a prolonged gaming session. Blame that on older age or not but I never had that issue with the lighter feeling Chroma. Compared to the Chroma the Trinity feels larger in the hand. If you put them side by side you may not notice all too much of a difference but just from resting my hand on the Trinity then moving back to the Chroma it was like night and day.All in all it's not a horrible product though. There are some positives. The material feels good on the skin. I've never had any qualms about it. Although the Trinity does feel larger in the hand it also does feel a bit more "ergonomic". I still prefer the feel of the Chroma though. The swap-able sides are a good idea with the software to boot for customization and key mapping but it's a shame I'll never get around to trying them out.
4,Long battery life and works great at least the replacement mouse does. My first mouse worked good at first but completely quit working after a week or so. Second one has worked well so far. Make sure you use the dongle extension and put it near your keyboard because I was having tons of tracking issues before I did that.
5,I have used this mouse since 2017 and just got a replacement in 2021. I use the 12 side buttons for a full second hotbar when playing MMORPG games like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV. Then theres the extra five buttons after that. Makes it easy to bind a mount or sprint button to and makes weaving in off globals super smooth with customization.Super recommended!
4,Right out of the box the right mouse button feels very loose. I thought that this was an issue with the particular product that I received but the replacement that was sent has the same problem as well.About eight months after purchase both the left and right click functions sometimes register multiple rapid inputs when held down- which makes clicking and dragging items frustrating.These two issues aside this has been my favorite mouse for gaming after having used past iterations of the Naga as well as a popular Logitech variant. I would rate this product five stars if the material were more sturdy out of the box and more durable over time.
2,Before you blindly espouse "MOUSE ACCELERATION IS BAD FOR GAMING!!!" let me point out that there are plenty of us who work on a computer all day as well. I'm an IT consultant and I have a 4k monitor plus three more 1080p monitors plugged in; and working in Excel docs and such with that much virtual screen real estate having mouse acceleration enabled on the Windows desktop is absolutely critical. Much to my chagrin after buying this and doing quite a bit of research online Razer is ignoring the problem and blaming it on Microsoft removing the mouse acceleration API from Windows 10. Well I don't know if they did or didn't but the feature is still there in mouse settings in Windows 10 and all my Logitech mice still use it perfectly fine it's ONLY Razer that it doesn't work with and they are pretending this is preferred functionality. (There are Reddit threads where the official Razer R&D account has replied blaming it on Microsoft removing the functionality while conveniently ignoring the fact that all Logitech mice still use it perfectly fine.)I cannot recommend a Razer mouse to anyone until they acknowledge and fix this heinous oversight. When you have 6000+ by 3000+ pixels of screen real estate and you're a power user for work all day it's not an option to not have mouse acceleration. I'm returning this posthaste.
1,Highly recommend staying away from this. The hyper speed wireless 2.4ghz adapter connection lags/stutters even after the firmware update and occasionally disconnects and reconnects. Synapse software is hit or miss if it will even show your device even after updating it to recognize the device upon first connection. Bluetooth is smooth but if it goes into idle/power saving or you shut it off or switch modes to 2.4ghz and back all 3 scenarios will not allow the mouse to be recognized and require it to be re-paired every single time. I wanted to love this mouse because it feels great battery life is awesome and when it works no matter what side panel is being used it is recognized and performs well but with both wireless and Bluetooth connections having issues stay away from this mouse all together. Wired mode worked fine but just buy a wired mouse if that’s the connection you want and you can probably save some money
5,i've been a corsair user for years but since buying razer products i have to say those days are long gone. this mouse is a game changer for me a must buy for both a casual or a hardcore gamer. the buttons are well placed for my big hands and i've rarely missed a button press. the keybinding set up is a little daunting and can be a bit tricky to get the hang of but once you do it enough it's pretty easy to master. all around great mouse and money well spent.
5,Plenty of DPI options. Quick magnetic interchangeable side panels are super convenient to switch depending on the game. Haven't had any discomfort using the mouse for long periods of time. Razer app makes custom lighting a breeze especially pairing the rgb setup to match your keyboard. Hands down best mouse I've ever owned.
5,A great mouse that's working well for me. I bought it primarily because of its size - I have enormous hands (20x11cm for reference) - and I wasn't happy with other regularly-sized mouse options on the market. I've also found the swappable button pads surprisingly useful. I frequently play different kinds of games and having the variable button layouts is proving to be handy. I also haven't had any issues swapping the pads thus far. The package was a little banged up when it arrived but fortunately it didn't affect the mouse. An excellent choice for users with much larger hands!
5,This mouse is perfect. It has everything a gamer needs. Not only does it come with multiple side panels for easy magnetic customization but it is also comfortable to use for long periods of time. The number keypad specifically changed how I play MMORPGs as it enables you to keep your fingers on your movement keys while throwing off your abilities at the same time with ease. I highly highly recommend this mouse to any gamer out there. It is the best mouse I have ever purchased.
1,On the Razer Naga X... Save your money DO NOT buy this mouse- get yourself a Logitech or Corsair instead. I have spent hours trying to get my computer or Razer Synapse to even recognize the mouse. Turns out it draws too much power from my USB ports. So you turn the RGB lights off- easy! Unless of course your PC isn't recognizing the hardware. I eventually got the mouse functionality to work but the RGB lights wouldn't work and Synapse still wouldn't recognize the mouse so I couldn't test a dimmer light or use macros. I wish I could rate this zero stars- because that is what a device with zero functionality works.Hey there's an upside though! So many people have this exact same issue it'll be fairly easy to troubleshoot once your package arrives. Razer's own troubleshooting guide isn't helpful in the slightest but that's what Google is for!
5,I was using the 12 button Naga Chroma. I used it so much I rubbed the sides smooth and felt the buttons were starting to get soft. I press very hard on them. This mouse with the 12 button panel look almost identical to the Naga Chroma. The buttons seem to sound louder but I suspect they are just newer. The good news is the Naga Trinity is at least as good as the Naga Chroma with the added bonus you get a 7 button and 2 button option depending on your needs. Just do not expect it to be a noticeable improvement over the Naga Chroma you already have.If you do not have a multi-button mouse for gaming or work this is the one to get. While others try to make a cheap imitation the Naga has matured and moved well beyond beta and version 1s.
5,The pro is so much nicer than the Razer Naga Trinity. The wheel is smooth not clicky like the Trinity. I play wired but the option to have it wireless is really nice. Definitely feels better made then the Razer Naga Trinity. I have been through two Razer Naga Trinitys since the start of the year so all I hope is for this one to last longer then 3 to 6 months. Only minor gripe is the top two buttons are pulled back from the wheel which feels weird but im sure I'll get used to it.
5,I love this mouse!!! However I do game A Lot!! And my last trinity only lasted 12 months! Just be aware that if you are a heavy gamer it will not last the full 2 years AND customer support is sucky! So instead of RMAing the mouse (yet) I just got a new one. But like I stated I game pretty heavily AND I’m a “mouse clicker” not a keyboard clicker. So the left mouse button is messed up. And yes! It IS a known issue with Razer mice. But for the year I’ve owned it I’ve loved having the “hex” option!!If another company had a hex-style mouse I’d probably try that out. But as before. Not going to fault it for my style of gameplay.
5,i love this mouse so much no cap! if youre someone that prefer MMO mice this thing is for you.nothing else can touch it. ive only ever used the g600 and that thing is weak and out dated.. more than i knew but soon as i switched to this naga x i realized what i was missing out on with these new mice and the fancy lasers and all that. ill never use anything else but the updated versions of this model.
1,Before i start please bear in mind that i am a "hardcore" gamer; someone who plays games for over 6 hours a day at minimum. I use my mouse A LOT and I tend to put a lot of stress on my mice just due to the sheer amount of time i play games...I've had my Trinity since April of last year. The mouse only lasted about 4 months before the side buttons would just stop working. The lights would turn off on the mouse and the side buttons stopped registering. Thankfully you can disconnect and reconnect the side to get this to fix but this should NOT be an issue at all...The other more frustrating issue is the left mouse button broke after 6 months. The mouse will consistently double click every 3-5 clicks and sometimes will stop drag and drop. without warning. After doing some research on the issue it is because of a super tiny spring inside the mouse and it will need some adjustment to fix. This is NOT a software issue as the issue persisted on a laptop and desktop which my laptop does not have the software.If anyone remembers the old Naga had the super annoying scroll wheel issue. You needed to open your mouse and take apart the scroll wheel and adjust a small copper plate to get it to work for about 2 weeks or so. The quality of that mouse is extremely sub-par and while an MMO mouse just not worth the hassle.It appears that the Trinity is made with the same lack of longevity and lack of quality that the old Naga had. Don't get me wrong this mouse is awesome but for someone who games A LOT this mouse needs to be avoided. Also this product is HEAVILY inflated. I bought mine for around $70 and now they are almost $100!!!Please go look at other products like a Scimitar.
3,I have bought this mouse twice now and both have only lasted roughly one year before I start having problems with the mouse button double clicking when I Either only click once or hold it down. I enjoy the mouse while I have it. The programmable buttons are nice and being able to switch out the sides based on gameplay is fun too. But I can’t justify buying the mouse if you are using your computer often because they just don’t seem to hold up to the rest of time.
2,My original Naga finally started to have left click issues after 6 years so I grabbed one of these thinking it would be essentially the same mouse... boy was I wrong. The mouse is huge and awkward feeling and the side button will press without intending to they're much to soft and loose feeling almost has a cheap feeling to them. I wish they would bring back the older style Naga... that was my favorite mouse ever and now I'll have to look into other brands since this thing is so trash.
5,Works great!
5,Upgraded from the Naga 2014.  This mouse is heavier i knew this watching a few reviews.  I really don't mind the slight extra weight it feels right.  The RBG lights have a ton of lighting options including one that reacts to sound.  Only the 12 button layout will light up. The charging cable is on par or even better IMO than the cable on my older naga 14.  I do wish that this came with the wireless charging station.  I like however it is compatible with them now i have to buy one GG.
5,Se lo regale a mi hijo y lo usa para jugar es de excelente calidad ergonómico y elegante a la vez
3,This product was everything I wanted when I first got it. The interchangeable side plates worked great and it was a very comfortable mouse. After about 9 months of using it though I realized the right click would sometimes double click or not register my click at all while all I was doing was holding the button down. As a few more months passed this problem just continued to get worse and worse to the point where the right click button outright does not work anymore. This has rendered the mouse completely unusable to me as just about everything I use it for requires the right click in different ways that I simply cannot use it anymore. I would highly recommend AGAINST purchasing this product as its lifespan (both in my own experience and separate research) is not even close to worth the price tag.
3,I've been using this mouse for a little over a month now and just recently when I was playing CS:GO I made a fast flick and since then the left mouse button has been very sensitive to the point where if I lay my finger on the button I have a high chance of accidentally clicking which I find pretty disappointing.  I don't think I was overly aggressive with it or violent especially not for a mouse which is $70 and marketed as a gaming mouse.  I don't know if I'm the only one with this issue but it is still disappointing. The mouse worked great prior to this issue and all of the other features still work but the left button issue is still immensely irritating.
5,Amo este mouse! gracias a el conocí la marca Razer.  Es un mouse con 12 botones programables con letras del teclado o macros ideales para softwares como AutoCAD o SketchUp. Al ser inalámbrico es bastante cómodo usarlo y meterlo a la mochila sin cables que estorben. Es muy agradable verlo iluminado se siente de bastante calidad. Antes tenía el Naga normal pero definitivamente me quedo con esta versión inalámbrica.
5,I love the variety of the swappable sides and the variable sensitivity allows this mouse in both gaming and more mundane use.
5,Works and no issues. Feels a little light but gets the job done well and battery works better than expected
5,Fortunately Razer updated their software for Mac and it not matching the white of the Mac keyboard and mouse are it's only 'knocks'.  The side buttons swap quickly becAuse they are held by magnets and the mouse and software detect the change will remap the programmed buttons automatically!  I suppose the RGB could be considered tame but I like it a lot and think it great.I duel boot Windows and there the software is more programmable and that's the only minor quibble.  The settings are not stored in the mouse and require software and the Mac version is not equal to the PC version.  But it's still far ahead of anything else I've tried on the market.
1,So right up front. I love the Naga mouse that being said the quality has been steadily declining over the years since its release. Razer mice have always had a reputation for the left mouse button dbl click issue. This is the first one that I have had that actually started doing it (I have had several over the years that I actually just wore them out) in the warranty period. So here is the process you will be subjected to.1.) The typical scripted "troubleshooting" - no points off for this - standard fare.2.) Once you have verified that all this still results in a randomly dbl clicking mouse - they will make you take a video where they can see the mouse being clicked while on a mouse testing webpage to verify the problem - and upload that to them...do this in a low as res as possible because insanely small upload size on their chat.3.) They will send you a label and I suppose a box to send the broken mouse back with after they receive the mouse they will send you a replacement. ....yeah so I guess you better have a back up. OR4.) You can put down a "deposit" aka buy a new one until they get your old one back wherein they will "refund" you.If all that seems fine to you - then this might be the mouse for you. As for me - After years of buying and recommending Razer - one call to their customer support has sent me in search of a new peripherals provider. Too bad too I really love the feel of the Naga mouse design.
5,Razer tends to produce good mice and this is no exception. while I myself only use the 12 button layout it is nice to know that you can easily hot swap between one of the other two.Switching between the different attachments is easy as they are just he's in place by magnets. The braided cable is long enough to meet just about any realistic distance you need.You will need to install the necessary software in order to properly use the mouse but it is not difficult to figure out.
1,I'm leaving this review because I'm fed up. I never leave reviews for anything but I felt so compelled after my experience with this mouse. I bought this mouse because I had the first version of it. After 4 years of gaming on that mouse I decided to upgrade to this model. I loved the feel of the old mouse and the placement of the buttons. This mouse is incredibly similar to it in that regard so for me it was a no brainer to purchase this mouse. The first one I got worked for about 2 months before it started to crap out on me. The left click button would sometimes "double click" when I pressed it once. I overlooked it initially but eventually the problem got worse and it was hard to ignore. Just imagine double clicking everything you click on that's how bad it got. For most games it made it unplayable.  So I contacted amazon about a return and of course it was too long since purchase to receive a full refund. Not amazon's fault but annoying nonetheless. Thankfully I was able to get about 70% of the money I spent back. I thought that maybe this was a fluke and a freak incident of some sort and I really do love the feel of the mouse so I decided to order another one. This time it lasted three months and guess what started happening. IT WAS DOUBLE CLICKING EVERYTHING AGAIN. The same issue on two different mouses. From a company like razor I expected much better quality. The first mouse I had made by Razor lasted me almost 5 years so I expected much more. I'm extremely disappointed and I suggest you avoid this mouse and any Razor products at all costs.
4,I've been using this mouse for a few months now and it works perfectly. It's fully customizable to anything you need and allows you to re-map any buttons to any keys you want with several profiles as well. It can be a little cumbersome on the front end to figure out but nothing too bad. Would recommend.
1,I was given a Razer Naga Trinity almost 10 years ago and it served me well for about 8 years before finally giving up the ghost. For an 80 dollar mouse that's reasonable. This mouse lasted 18 months before the right mouse button would not hold down properly and would incessantly double click.I use this for MMOs (Guild Wars 2 I love raiding) and when it comes down to it you need to be able to trust your equipment. My playstyle revolves around holding the right mouse button down... a lot. It helps me pan the camera quickly to see mechanics and keep my team alive. Regardless of all the fancy buttons on the side (which I use constantly)  a mouse has to be able to click and right click. This mouse fails to meet that expectation. For $81.99 I expect more than a year and a half.To be specific I purchased this mouse July 8 2020 and it started to be a little buggy on Jan 10 2022 and became completely inoperable for endgame content on Jan 15th. It's frustrating to have a mouse that feels good in the hand with all the buttons I need fail so miserably. I don't mind the bloatware I don't mind the high price: as long as the thing does what it promises to do. That's the last time I ever give Razer my money.
1,What happened to Razer? I remember when Razer products would last forever I still have an 5+ year old Razer mouse that works. This product however is nothing like that. I have owned this mouse for less than a year 6 months to be exact and it bricked itself today. I sat my mouse down and went to get a cup of coffee when I returned my mouse was off. No inputs charging or advise on the Razer site "charge for 30 minutes" would revive my mouse. Razer seems to have gone down the path of planned obsolescence and I went from loving their products to being burned by the company. If I could give the mouse zero stars I would please choose a different company if you need PC assessories.
2,I've been a long time Naga user and I purchased the Trinity after my 4-yr old Naga started having issues.  Shortly after I began using it I started having trouble with my Tartarus keypad.  The Tartarus was also close to 4 years old so I assumed that the issue was with the keypad and replaced it with the Orbweaver.  I considered the Tartarus v2 but the key layout on the Orbweaver seemed to be better suited to how I use a gamepad.So after spending $120 for the Orbweaver I've discovered that the issue has nothing to do with hardware.  It seems like there's a compatibility issue between the versions of the Synapse software required for the two devices.  The Naga Trinity requires version 3 while the Orbweaver requires version 2.  Version 3 appears to be still in beta and it's not backward compatible with a lot of devices that Razer is still selling.  This quite frankly is inexcusable.  It means that the Chroma synchronization that Razer advertises will not work for these devices since the two version of the software cannot recognize the other devices.  Worse yet there seems to be some type of intermittent conflict that results in the Tartarus and Orbweaver keypads failing back to their default settings rather than accepting the defined profiles that I've built for them.  This effectively makes them useless for gaming.Given the way I use the Orbweaver and Naga I think my best bet will be to get a competitor's mouse and keep the Orbweaver and it's Synapse version 2 software.  I don't think I'll ever get another Razer product again given their inability to recognize that backward compatibility is kinda an important thing.
1,I loved this mouse and the previous naga i had but one day it just stopped tracking correctly and would constantly disconnect and reconnect and after hours of trouble shooting I come to find that its common for them to just break like this and need replaced something to do with the batter apparently... not worth 160$ for this and the doc as a razer fanboy typing this on a full razer setup I'm very disappointed
5,My 2nd Naga mouse ... been using them for some time now. First version was a little nicer but didn't work with the razer mousepad. This one works the same but the feel is a little odd as the original had a more mechanical feel on the side buttons. 12 on the side works great for Warcraft. Chroma dock is a nice add and battery life is not a problem. Great mouse overall for gaming just wish they'd cleanup the Chroma software ... tends to forget the mouse and Nostromo is there.
1,We have used Razer's in my house since they first came out. Usually because we are the type of people who'll sit at the pc and play games anywhere from 4hr to 12hrs on a given day not counting net surfing and anything else required by a basic mouse function. With this knowledge unfortunately our mice tend to start double clicking within 6mo to a year. It sucked We'd blow it out get a few more months out of it then begrudgingly buy another even though we hated shelling that much out for something like that However we KNEW it was a quality piece of game tech we relied on. So when we had the chance to get my husband the Trinity that he's been eyeing for along time we thought we'd have this mouse a MINIMAL of six mo to 1yr.. We bought it mid May 2020.. It started double clicking in the beginning of July.... We were kind of like like what the hell. We were like ok we are glad we went with our gut got a warrenty it was one of those things we never have with our mice but it was something that I was like lets do it just in case. Thankfully the mouse was still under Razer warrenty. It took over 2wks which I understand especially considering Covid conditions to get the replacement mouse.. He received it July 23rd... It's August 4th.. Guess what.. the new one is also double clicking. You can not tell me that it is something he is doing because I have had friends WARN us about this mouse and we were like well we'll try it anyways. I wish we listened. If your not a gamer it might not bust on you fast. I wish you luck. I don't think we will be buying from Razer for a while.
5,guy anyone looking to get any razer product get it here on amazon and get the renewed items !!!! the item description says used but man I have purchased my 2 keyboards and mouse and all the products are basically new. plus I am able to register them on razers website and I still get the 2-year warranty !!!!! the worst thing that could happen is the item has some scratches and if it does just return it.
1,I dislike a piece of hardware that REQUIRES internet and cloud access in order to run the driver/configuration software. Connecting to the internet/cloud for updates is one thing. Requiring you to log in after every reboot is a very poor design. They also do a bait and switch. After you install the software they offer a free license to their audio mixer software IF you'll register; HOWEVER AFTER you register the dialog says the code will be emailed to you. You'll never receive the code. I contacted support who informed me that they don't offer that "promotion" anymore. They are a 2bit company that probably won't be around in 10 years.
3,Pros: Good mouse for many genres of games with the interchangeable side parts. Great response time.Cons: Mouse is a bit on the heavy side. Can feel it if you use it for long hours especially for gaming. Most of all it's expensive. It does not even come with the charging dock. That comes separate and pricey as well. Ergonomics and looks is on the plain side nothing special.Overall: Good mouse. Was expecting a lot more for the price a lighter weight better ergonomic design and comes with the charging dock.
3,I like my mouse wheels like I like my men Quiet and smooth.  This one clicks and feels hyper sensitive and ready to stalk me after I tell it we're just friends.
5,I'm always a little hesitant purchasing razer products because it's either really great or kinda eh. So far I really like this one! The side buttons and right and left mouse click and really smoothe and respond well when pressed and the mouse is pretty comfortable to hold for long periods of time. My only issue so far is the scroll wheel not scrolling as fast as I'd like. But this isn't an issue of the product itself just my preference.
5,This is a great mouse! I was a little worried about the size since one of the side options is 12 buttons but it fits very comfortably in my hand (I have small-ish hands) and I have no problem using all 12 buttons. I also love that the color syncs with all my other Razor chroma products. This is a great gaming mouse and I highly recommend it. I cant say how long it will last as I have not had it for long but my last Razor mouse lasted 8+ years and only got replaced because I wanted to be able to change the color and have more side buttons.
5,This is a high quality mouse with great performance. It has cool lights and nice buttons on it!
5,Updated may 8th 2021- I still have this mouse and its still working!!!!!! I purchased this mouse back in 2019. No double clicking issues and no weird problems. I keep everything on my computer up to date software wise and hardware wise.For some reason it has a lot of latency on my gaming PC. I use a wired connection for my Internet and I have a very high processor rate as well very good computer parts in general. I runoff windows 10 64 bit. The only reason I bought it was the 12 side buttons and the ability to  switch a couple options while gaming.
1,I want to preface this by saying that I truly do love the Razer Naga I've been buying them since the original came out and have grown used to how perfectly they fit my hand and how all 12 side buttons are to use but I can't stand with them anymore after this mouse its getting to become too expensive to do so.Back when the Naga was first introduced the mice had acceptable build quality lasting for about 1-2 years of solid 12-18 hours of daily use. This quality has sadly deteriorated over the years leading to the mice breaking within 10 months...8 months...6 months...4 months...and now with the latest model my mouse lasted a whopping TEN days before getting the infamous double clicking issue as well as the mouse being unable to hold down a click without triggering multiple times while dragging. I had hoped that this new clicking mechanism they advertised on the new model would fix the issue but it seems to have only made it worse 10 days of normal use while being careful with it because I know how these mice are is a complete joke Razer should be ashamed of how awful their build quality has become on this line of mice over the years. I have a graveyard of varying levels of broken nagas in a box at least 10 of them now I really do want to keep using them but dropping $80 every few months on a new mouse is not exactly something I want to be doing.Please Razer fix this problem I want to give you my money for your excellent ergonomic design but I can't do it anymore.
5,I use the 6 side button plate exclusively.  It works very well while giving me access to everything.  I just wish I had gotten the dock from the get go.  Throwing it in there after every session is much better than dealing with the cable.
5,I bought this because it is seriously the only Wireless mouse that has the 12 button grid-style layout that is great for MMO gamers. I love this mouse and it works well on my Windows 10 Desktop as well as my M1 Macbook Pro. I did need to run a single terminal command for the Shift modifiers to work with the mouse but a quick search on Reddit will get you up and running in less than 2mins.
2,I've been using Nagas for years. I started with a Molten way back in 2012 or so. I used the 2014 models a 2014 style Chroma and now two Trinity styles.Every single one has failed. The original molten held up for five years which I find entirely reasonable. The 2014 ones developed issues with their scroll wheels failing and the side buttons not working. I had several warranty chains with them continuously sending me back broken devices. It was a nightmare.The Trinity variant the one this review is for is a new low. For all of the improvements they still can't seem to make a reliable product. The left and right click are FAR too sensitive on this model when compared to any other mouse. I can barely stand to use them due to constant misclicks. Now the typical Razer reliability strikes with both of the ones I purchased developing the same problem where holding the button down doesn't result in a solid long-click. It begins to drop out and results in dropping files I'm trying to drag or failing actions in games (heavy attack lockpicking etc.)UPDATE: Turns out this is the fault of shoddy Omron switches. Soldered on some cherry ones and now they mouse is significantly improved. Go figure.As usual I have to RMA these devices that I take excellent care of. As usual Razer makes cheap garbage. If not for me hating the feel of every single 12-button panel alternative I wouldn't bother. When these work they feel great and the side buttons are easy to navigate. The problem is they decide not to work after a while and Razer's customer service is laughable.Avoid this product and this company.
1,I like many swore by the brand for many a year starting back with the original naga. But like all good things this one comes to crap all over the brand. After heavy use the left mouse button suffers from hyper clicking on one use is the 2nd one Ive tried thinking the first one was a one off but the second one failed faster then the first one. Ive torn it apart and cleaned it voiding the warranty which is fine as only way to get a replacement is to send it to Razer an then wait for them to ship you one back which some can do without a hassle but I am not one of those people I expect better service for the premium spent on such a product. And doing a bit of research Im not the only one that has come to the conclusion that the use of an inferior part for the left click spring is the culprit and seemingly a very common issue with this model from Razer. Buy it at your risk though I would buy another brand if I were you.
3,I had high hopes for this mouse for MMO and PVP but am at a loss because the configuration I wanted doesn't actually work. I'm hoping this is a software issue because I just received this mouse and haven't really had a chance to put it through its paces.My "2" key on the 12 button configuration does not work at all but started to diminish within a few weeks.
5,I bought this mouse recently for playing runescape 3 mainly and it works exactly like I need it to/ it's suppose to.. plenty of buttons to keyboard and it had the changeable button setups which is very nice for when I'm not playing my game and don't need the extra 12 buttons... I would buy this mouse again. I have only had it for about a month so we will see if it continues to be reliable.
5,The swappable side keys are so easy to use.  Sometimes I’ll load an FPS and need to swap to a different side key option so I can detach and attach the new one in 5 seconds.I suffered ZERO performance loss after switching from Logitech to this Razer.  It was immediately as good or better as my expensive Logitech.My opinion is that Razer makes the best gaming mice and Logitech is overpriced garbage.
3,I take very good care of my devices and it broke 2 months after just infinite left clicking completely unusable no matter how much I cleaned it. I've used a lot of razer products including the keyboard I'm using right now but this is incredibly disappointing.I did contact them and got a replacement but it's too early to say this won't just also suffer the same fate. I suppose time will tell its not really a good feeling to have to worry about a product
5,The box inside the package was smashed but the mouse was protected. It works wonderfully. It works like a better version of my Naga from 9 years ago. Runs like butter and is great from gaming and 3d modeling
3,I previously had the old razer naga hex and wanted this since I play a wide variety of game genres.  I enjoy the feel of this mouse the hand sits very nice and comfortably on it.  I like how the different side plates are switched out with the magnets its very simple and quick to change between them.  I also think the optical sensor works well its very smooth and I have seen no issues with it on my desk.My issue with this mouse at the moment and why its 3 stars is the side buttons themselves which I am going to contact razer support for.  On the 7 and 12 button sides 1 or 2 of the buttons do not register a press on them unless you put more pressure than you have to put on all the other buttons.  For example on the 7 button side.  I will push the '1' button and after the tactile sound makes a click it still didn't register me clicking 1 I had to continue to push harder before it finally recognized the button press.  The other buttons on the same side do not have this problem they register the moment the tactile sounds makes that click.  Please be aware of this issue for anyone who needs the reliability for competitive gaming.  I am hoping their support will be able to help me.
5,This mouse Naga X has a slightly different arrangement of buttons than the Naga Molten.  It also weights a bit less but  if you play MMORPGs it is worth the money.
5,Aside from some of the bad reviews saying it doesnt last long. It worked out of the box. The app is easy enough to install. The software can be a bit confusing at first but I played with the lighting set profiles etc.. Only things I think is missing is that you can't plug it in to another computer and use onboarding profiles unless you download the Razer app first and the Chroma lighting options are a bit unintuitive and have limited options.
5,Love the mouse has everything you could want for in one. Bought it mainly because i love the 12 button side-plates however this comes with two additional side-plates - one with 7 buttons in a circle and a simple two button. This allows me to have the 12 button for heavy games such as mmos a medium variant for something like Overwatch. And the two button i like to use in single player titles as it is more comfortable. All incredibly easy to swap out on the fly. Overall though the only thing i wish for was it was wireless other than that couldnt ask for more great product
5,My son who loves to game is in love with this product! highly recommended!
5,I had a Logitech G600 for 7 years before it quit on me and switched to this because of shape and button options. Overall I love the razor mouse because of the feel and the buttons. It feels very high quality and I think it works very well for gaming and 3D modeling. I do wish it weighed more or had higher quality plastic. I have very warm hands and it seems to suck up my heat. After an hour or so it becomes warm and sometimes sticky. Not terrible but I wish it would stay cooler to the touch after use. Overall I love it. The software makes for easy programming and I like it more than the Logitech stuff.
5,I wish I would have gotten this sooner.  I absolutely LOVE it.
2,I've purchased half a dozen of these mice over the past 10 years or so. I like the feel of them but every single one of them ends up wearing out and doing that double clicking thing where holding down the mouse buttons fails and you end up clicking several times. Sucks for games where you have to hold down buttons or even just for scrolling. My current mouse seems fine most times but occasionally I suspect I am having that problem and it bothers me.
5,Been using this mouse for WoW and I absolutely love it. Feels as if there is not latcenty issues and the charger with USB and dongle is perfect.
2,Very finicky about charging. Poor connection with remote receiver.
4,Looks like it'll be bigger which is what i wanted.  Doesn't feel as premium as the Basilisk.  Feet/Glides/Skates are awesome sensor is awesome different side plates are awesome just a little more narrow than expected.Also down 1 star for RAZER being cheap and not including the charge dock like they do for the Basilisk and the Viper.
2,Reasonably decent as a mouse on its own however if you want to really use the full functionality (and get your price's worth) you'll need to use their Synapse 3 software which is clearly underdeveloped.Synapse 3 came out at least 4 years ago as well and there are a lot of somewhat basic functionalities missing even now so I find it doubtful that they intend to improve it any time soon.As of now neither this mouse nor any other hardware that relies on Synapse 3 is worth the money.
2,When I received the mouse I got 2 of the 7 button faceplates and no 12 button faces. I contacted amazon and found out that I couldn't get a replacement because they didn't have any in stock so I contacted razer directly to see if they could just send me a 12 button plate.  I jumped through the hoops they requested which included a picture of the mouse with the 2 face plates and my conversation with amazon.  After I was told they would be replacing the entire product and I should hear from their Return Merchandise Team in the next 24 hours.  Every part of the interaction with razer took at least 2 to 3 times longer than I was told to expect.  Almost a week after giving them my shipping info I get an email with the return label to send back the original mouse saying that they would send the replacement when they received the item.  I expected it to be on the way if not in my P.O box already.  They apparently expect me to go a month without a mouse while they take their sweat time with my replacement?  I'm good.  They obviously don't care about my business so I'll go with another brand.
4,I’m returning this and getting the Razer Basilisk.  The swappable plate is obviously the reason to get this thing but muscle memory is a funny thing and I find that I prefer not to switch. It’s a good idea in theory but I don’t think it’s for serious gamers.
5,Great mouse for gaming. I swap out the side panel between different games with no problem
2,Had the mouse for about a year and 4 months. Loved the mouse for the interchangeable side pieces and the amount of customization I got.  Just recently I noticed my mouse was double clicking alot and not being able to click hold when highlighting text or gaming. Love razer and love their products but this is a real suck.
1,I really wanted to like this mouse I was replacing a 2014 Razer Naga with a busted mouse wheel. So I ordered this while it was on sale for about $20 off normal price. Was really excited only intended on using the 12-button plate for World of Warcraft even for other games I never felt the need to switch plates. However it'd randomly start having moments where one or more buttons (for instance the number 4 on the razer Naga) would not operate I could click the ability in WoW but it'd not work with the plate button on the mouse. At times it'd be even worse sometimes the right and left click wouldn't work or none of the buttons on the plate would work. Alt-tabbing to windows would prove unresponsive forcing an entire reboot. Eventually after numerous troubleshooting Razer support etc I would end up having to take off the plate and pop it back on in the heat of game play to get keys to function again but then reboot afterward when I had a period of free time so I could do anything on my desktop\windows. This seemed most prominent on WoW when using the 12-button mouse plate (again I only purchased this mouse for this). Razer support helped me with uninstalling reinstalling registery drivers etc. trying multiple things above and beyond that all to no avail. Eventually support seemingly acknowledged the most likely culprit was the connectors on the plate and that the best option while I had the warranty and return\replacement option was to simply get a refund or get it replaced. So I went with that I may still search for the older Naga Epic without removable plates or go with another brand finally I don't know. But I do know that I will never get this mouse again as these plates are nothing but an added point of failure in my eyes where just one more thing can go wrong unnecessarily. I'm glad Razer support worked their butts off to help and Amazon refunded for the mouse effortlessly. So all in all it was just annoying but I learned my lesson.
3,I bought this to replace my DeathAdder that was suffering from some cosmetic wear and tear. I have short fingers and big palms so I thought the shape of this mouse would be more comfortable than the DeathAdder. It is more comfortable for sure though I do wish I had more pinky support. The quality of materials and construction is an iterative change over three to four years ago when I bought the DeathAdder.Unfortunately the features only work with Synapse 3; 2 isn't supported. My BlackWidow 2016 doesn't work on Synapse 3 only 2. That means I have two different versions of proprietary bloatware on my computer just for Razer peripherals. The entire reason why I went Razer again was to avoid separate software for KB and mouse. The mouse is also just a bit heavy. The texture is a bit less grippy/sticky than I'd like; you have to clamp down on the mouse with a bit more force to lift it off the mouse pad.All in all this is a decent purchase but not the best peripheral experience I've had.
5,I'll update my review when I've actually been able to really use this mouse but just feeling and holding it? Yeah I already feel like its more than worth the cost. I've been using cheap mice my whole life so this is a very very welcome change. Again i haven't really been able to use it so i don't feel right recommending you buy it but i feel like soon I'll be singing endless praises about it.
1,So my old Naga finally died and I bought this.  Worked great wasn't overly impressed with the new Synapse software but dealt with it.  While under warranty it started the typical Naga issue with the Left mouse button double clicking (this has been an issue with Naga mice forever they have never fixed it) this one though seems to be the worst it happened earlier then my others (the others at least waited to start this when they were out of warranty).  Since the mouse was still under warranty rather then opening it up and cleaning and "fixing" the switch like I would do to my others I contacted Razer.  Oh man talk about a month of frustration just for them to determine there is an issue with the mouse.  I had to include videos showing the issue I had to do this on multiple computers with and without the software.  Finally after I got frustrated and flat out asked them "are you giving me the run around until I get so frustrated and give up?" that they finally gave me the RMA to ship the mouse back.  Now I am being told the mouse is out of stock and their will be more delays on getting it back (I understand COVID happened that doesn't lessen the frustration though for something that has plagued them since I have owned them).  2 months now and I still don't have a mouse.  Honestly once I get the replacement and when it finally dies (hopefully out of warranty this time so I don't have to go through those hoop tricks again) I will have to research a new (and hopefully better made) mouse to use for gaming.
5,Easily the best mouse I’ve ever used. It is super responsive and has multiple and customizable DPI settings. You can save your key binds to the mouse in different profiles. That’s been the most useful. As a CAD drafter it has improved my work flow quite a bit. Gaming is also a bit better. This mouse is super accurate. No lag time between drags. As Razer products go this thing is among the best.
4,The only thing I don’t like is the size. It’s on the larger side so it’s a bit uncomfortable for my hands. The older model I replaced was smaller. However overall I still like the mouse alot
5,I would recommend anyone this mouse.
4,I bought this mouse in Nov 2019 it is now Aug 2020 and I am running into a weird issue where when trying to move icons on the desktop it acts as if I am double-clicking them and opens then up after the application or file opens THEN I can move it if not for this issue it would have gotten a perfect 5*
1,Just another garbage Razer product and it will be the last one I ever buy. Just over a year and a half and the right mouse button on this mouse starts to fail conveniently out of the limited warranty period.I've had similar issues with Razer keycaps not responding in under a year and other mice that I've bought as well.Learn from my mistakes I will never buy another Razer product again. $150 for a fancy RGB paperweight.
1,This is simply too small. It is not comfortable to use and the side buttons are difficult to manage while gaming. Even every day use is tough because it is so uncomfortable. I wouldn’t recommend it if you have bigger hands. I would think if someone had small hands maybe a woman’s size hands it would be more comfortable so for them this is probably a dream.
2,Its a real shame this mouse has such a fatal flaw.  The infamous double click.  (You can search for it online)This mouse has nice feeling MMO buttons on the side that are responsive and work well.  The fell of the mouse in your hand is good as well (I have smaller hands).  However the synapse software is complete and total garbage (always has been) and you can't use this mouse because of the double clicking issue.  One regular click will either not click at all or will double click or will just click once as supposed to and theres no real rhyme or reason to which result you will get and when.If it weren't for the clicking issue I would easily give this mouse 4 stars even though synapse is garbage software its not super important as far as I'm concerned.  As long as the mouse keeps the DPI settings and button assignments the software does what its supposed to even if its painful at times.  But you can't click right.  Its a mouse that doesn't click right.  How this made it past quality control and is an issue for SO MANY PEOPLE IS AMAZING (in a BAD way).
1,Of course I expect everything to fail eventually. But for nearly 100$ USD this thing should last more than a month. The worst part is Razer support does not honor the "warranty" which is totally worthless. Go ahead and google for the problems that plague this and every Razer product. In my case the left click stopped working correctly. It is obviously a connector issue. And is in fact a known and common issue with Razer mice. Razer will still not agree to repair or replace it. Which seems to be a running theme with them since there are dozens of YouTube videos showing how to open up and repair the mouse yourself.Here follows a description of exactly what happens. While using this mouse the left click doesn't work properly. Sometimes this results in unintended doubles clicks. Sometimes it means no click at all. and perhaps the most annoying is when I click and it seems to work only to "let go" a moment latter during a "drag" Of course this makes gaming a complete mess. In shooters it means you cannot reliable shoot. In MMORPGs it means you cannot reliably target or move or even turn around sometimes.Finally the worst part of it is the attitude I got from Benjim @ Customer service. I really wish I had saved the emails from him. He was condescending and generally terrible. He doesn't seem to understand the problem at all. And keeps referring to my brand new mouse I bought on Amazon as some used mouse. Considering the mouse was released in November 2017 and I bought mine in April 2018 it seems unlikely that ANY "used" versions would be available at all. So this is a two fold issue. First do not buy any Razer at all. It will be hot garbage and break and cause you problems. But also do not skimp and try to save a few bucks with the "wharehouse deals" from Amazon. They will never be covered not by Amazon not by whatever company makes and sells the product. Believe me the few dollars you might save is not worth it.
4,This is the second one of these I've ordered. The software and interchangeable side buttons are really nice and offer lots of customization options. However the internal switches beneath the left and right mouse buttons are not the best quality. They will randomly double click or not register clicks at all. This has happened in both of the products I've owned from Razer. It doesn't affect most games but I definitely wouldn't recommend this for a fast reflex game like a first-person shooter.
5,I’ve had a naga mouse before but not the Trinity that has interchangeable side panels. I loved my old one and it lasted for years before the left click started not working right. I think it just needs to be cleaned but I saw this one and it was on sale and couldn’t pass it up! I absolutely love it and my Naga mouse really improved my game play. It’s convenient to have my abilities keybind to a simple mouse button. The panels are very easy to snap on and off. It’s very comfortable to use and responsive. Best of all the lights change color and I didn’t realize that when I bought it! Very happy with my purchase!
4,For the longest time I was so frustrated that the repeat scroll was soooo much slower than the original Razer Naga. Well it turns out you don't need to use "repeat scroll" you can simply use "scroll" with "turbo." Once I finally made that change it's all fine. Well fine so long as I don't use Synapse. Install it set it uninstall it forget it!
1,I love this mouse it’s a great idea but the execution of far from there! I have been using this company’s mice for about 5 years now and every year it’s the same thing the side buttons stop working or they will spam the key instead of doing it once. Example I press the 1 key once and it will loop “111111111”. My last one the right top mouse key stopped working unless excessive for war applied.To get it replaced they make you send two videos of it not working prior to doing useless diagnostic. I am now on week 3 waiting for there next team to ship it and replace it. Not to mention you must pay the original price upfront before receiving your replacement. Then you must send the defective one in to get your money back$161.00. For such a big company there products are complete trash and so is there customer service.Third time was the charm for me I hope I can find another product similar with a way better quality build….. take your chances or find a better company
2,I've never had an issue with Razer--until now. The mouse itself is amazing--as a woman with smaller hands I was concerned the mouse would be too big in comparison to my other Razer mouse. This was not the case & I wouldn't change a thing--the sizing of the mouse is perfect. However the Synapse software that comes with it has magically decided that it doesn't want to work anymore. It will run in the background but won't open for customization. Prior to this it worked just fine but after doing my own research it seems like many have this same issue. No amount of reinstallation driver deletion or  temp file removal seems to fix this issue so yay! Glad I spent the money to not get the most appealing features.If you're a bit more tech saavy than me or are looking for an ergonomic gaming mouse without looking for the customization then maybe this mouse is for you. But having a gaming mouse that I can't customize with their proprietary software doesn't seem like it's worth it to me. If I were within my return policy at this point I'd return it & find a Corsair that I like to go with my keyboard.
3,Never actually used this mouse since the pinky button is an essential feature for me and this does not have it.Otherwise a good mouse as far as I can tell. Feels pretty light in the hand compared to the G600 and has better feeling switches. I like the cable braiding since it doesn’t feel like it restricts movement much.
5,Don’t let the price deter you from buying this mouse it’s worth every penny. I’ve tried a few of the other top mouses in its category and they all feel cheap compared to the naga I purchased this to replace my naga 2014 and have no regrets whatsoever and actually prefer this new model. The quality of the side buttons on this mouse are FAR BETTER than any other gaming mouse sturdy and responsive. Synapse can be confusing but once you figure it out the software is fine. If you are looking for a gaming mouse this is the one to get.
2,As most of the lower reviews have stated the side buttons not working as they should is strong with this mouse. I've been unfortunately very disappointed with it. NOW the two button side works flawlessly for my shooter game that I play. But once I get up to the 6 and 12 button sides things just seem to fall apart. I was actually group kicked off an ESO dungeon because I was just standing there not doing DPS because my buttons were not registering my clicks. It was also my first time to do that dungeon so I was not the best anyway. But to be disrespected like that and called trash because my mouse is having issues hurts lol But yeah. I kind of don't recommend this for MMO style games with lots of skills and abilities. Hopefully Razer steps their shit up cause this really bums me out. I've spent probably upwards of 8k on their laptops and egpu builds because I do like their products. But this one just ain't it boss.
1,The entirety of the time i've owned this mouse has been nothing but one problem after another... The razer software that comes with this mouse is some of the worst of any gaming mouse I have ever owned. NOT hyperbole. Its so dysfunctional im compelled to leave a review.The mouse switching what macro / DPI profile im on seemingly at random....The lighting program deciding for me what color I actually wanted on my mouse.But all of that is childs play compared to the big one. The detachable side panel buttons... The way they connect to the mouse is laughably bad and results in buttons on the panel not working. The panels themselves are held on with magnets that will MOVE when you grip the mouse with any type of pressure. The pins on the mouse itself do not actually plug into anything ( which is probably a good thing given how much the side panels move a pin would probably just break)  they just make contact with a conductive surface on the side panels. I can't be the only one who is experiencing button failures but maybe the people who designed this mouse weren't incompetent and I just received a defective mouse. How its so highly rated is a mystery to me.I will never buy another razor mouse again.TLDR; You are better off buying separate mouses that perform for the game genres you play versus going for this.
1,I've never had a worse mouse. Before I had a razor death adder which worked fine except for that the middle mouse button didn't work but that was after 2-3 years of use.The Naga started double clicking a few months and only got worse with time. The RGB lights don't work sometimes for the different button attachments and sometimes the software forgets your binds and when you're playing a difficult game like Escape From Tarkov and you get into a fire fight and are pleasantly surprised that your keybinds don't work you WILL regret you bought this mouse.The paint on the attachments also wear away very easily and you will not be able to see the different buttons on the mouse that youre clicking.I BEG ANYONE READING THIS NOT TO GET THIS MOUSE GET ANYTHING ELSE.
5,To be able to have the ability to customize your own side panel with differing mouse key layouts with varying numbers of buttons is the dream. I have a large hand ping pong paddle sized and when my gorilla mit grabs a mouse they all feel insignificant and the mouse keys never lined up with where my thumb would comfortably lie. (right hand palm grip) However the circle layout of the mouse keys lined up just right and I can utilize all of the buttons in the circular layout much easier. Barely have to reach at all to use those bad boys just slide your thumb slightly and you've hit the key. I've tried a wireless logitech g502 and a rival steel series 600 gaming mouse as well. The buttons on the naga trinity are A+. Customizable DPI and if you don't want to switch stages you can enable static stages.
4,The buttons are very close together and just out of position enough to cause my hand to cramp up after a short time. The idea of interchangeable keypads is great and the magnetic design for the various plates works well. It just seems that this was designed for a small hand.
5,Over the years I have owned several versions of the Naga mouses (the original the MMO the Wireless etc.) and other additional Razer mice (Death Adder etc.). I use them for gaming for designs on my work computer and have even given them to family members as gifts. The Razer Naga Trinity has to be the BEST version out of all of them. The DPI is amazingly high its just as smooth feeling as my Razer Wireless (which was my previous favorite) it has customizable side plates for various button options (I don't need 12 buttons on my work computer so I can use a different faceplate) and can match any RGB color you need. All the previous versions only allowed green/blue which didn't always match my once backlit red keyboard (now it's green).
5,I carry all 3 side plates in my laptop bag and its super nice to be able to interchange config based on what game Im playing. This mouse is 3. I love it... LMK if you can find a state that will legally marry me to this mouse.
1,This mouse is great! That is when it isn't either randomly disconnecting stops working or just overall just turns off for a few seconds. This began like 3 days after I got the mouse but thinking maybe it would get fixed with an update it should be fine and it wasn't happening THAT much (yet). Fast forward 2 MONTHS ONLY TWO MONTHS of often gaming and such and this thing can't go more than 40 minutes without having some sort of issue. I talked to amazon support they directed me to Razer who then led me on for a month long email trip saying "Oh yeah! We can definitely help you just do this this and this and when you do it you actually did it wrong and then we want you to do it this way now more specifically but that's also wrong." Razer is known for having terrible customer support but I had not had an issue up till now. The mouse is awful and I have now had to use it connected 24/7 just to use it. It doesn't register clicks the side buttons randomly stop working and now I have to turn it on and off every time I turn on my laptop just to get it to work. I will never be buying a razer product again despite it being my favorite gaming company for so long and I hope you don't either.
4,Great mouse over all syncs with other Razor products for the color set ups also reacts to most games out there
5,It works well and feels good in my hand.
5,Very comfortable for long gaming use and casual use. I find myself only using the circle button side maybe I'll change it up in the future more. I like the mouse a lot it's reliable and just what I wanted the RGB is a fun touch and I like razers software you can use to program the buttons. I would recommend this product
5,Positives: 3 side plates to cater you gaming needs. grip and palm rest feel smooth. buttons feel responsive with being too heavy or soft to press. DPI buttons can be handy and are easily accessible. Negatives: lack of left and right scroll click no free scrolling on mouse. profile button is at the bottom of the mouse. the 7 button plate is not numerically order like 1234567... its 1237654 going clockwiseRAZER? Can you fix the numbering on the 7 button plate? make the numbers go 1234567!
1,This is the 5th Razor Naga mouse I have owned in the last 8 years. They always break down in 1-2 years. Either the sensor gets messed up with mouse movements or in this case it now double clicks on 1 click for the RMB(and yes I've tried the blow/cleaning trick it was a cheap plastic piece inside that broke off from clicking). I'm glad Razor innovated the 12 buttons on the side but now there are plenty of other companies doing the same without the planned obsolescence. I think I will avoid Razor products in the future. I still have a mouse I bought in the 90's that works just fine for 1/8th the price. Goodbye Razor.I just bought the Logitech (known for good lifelong stability) G600 as a replacement so I'm hoping it works out.
4,Great mouse but I find occasionally that some of the button presses dont register. I loved my 1st gen razer naga which didnt have the interchangeable side panel but this one is almost as good.
5,
5,An excellent mouse! A lot of software tools to customize your precise specifications. A warning: If you have tiny hands and like to use the 12-button gaming plate meant for your thumb it does take a bit getting used to (I found myself having to stretch my index and middle digits a little at first) until I had retrained my ergonomics and muscle memory for continued use. Good quality all around with this company and very bright colors which are also fully customizable. Most often my go to mouse.
2,Have been using razor products for years. As a gamer my keyboard and mouse are important. My Razer Naga Hex V2 finally started not working properly. Unfortunately they no longer make this model but the Razer Naga Trinity Gaming Mouse came up as comparable on several sites. Sorry guys not even close.  While the Naga Trinity is a nice mouse it just seems to have a cheap feel  to it and  very clicky buttons.
4,So the Naga Trinity works great. Very comfortable in my hand easy to game with. The only problem is and I've had this problem with previous Razer mice is now about a year later I'm getting double left clicks on a single click. Amazingly frustrating both while gaming or just with regular use.
4,I have a Razor Naga Molten (about 6 yrs old). I prefer that one to this new version. I play with the 12 button pad and the new buttons feel weird and don’t register quite as well as my old naga.It is still a good mouse.
5,I bought this to add some more buttons to my mouse.  I chose this over other MMO mice because of the side wheel style with 7 buttons instead of the much more (in my opinion) difficult to handle box style 12 button side.  My thumb rests perfectly in the middle of the wheel and it's easy to hit the buttons and tell them apart while playing.  The mouse itself is comfortable in my hand.
5,I used to have the deathadder elite. I like this mouse for the buttons in MMO's. The best way I found to program the extra buttons was to map them to the number pad and then assign those keys in game. This works great you just have to make sure your number lock isnt on. Its cool to be able to switch out the different button configurations depending on the game you are playing. Great mouse!
3,The mouse is light and snappy. I like the contour beside the right-mouse-button it provides a solid grip. Moreover the rubberized-grips below the thumb-buttons on the left side also feel good when gripping this mouse.I normally use this mouse with the two button attachment -- mostly for FPS games and it works great!I'll recommend this mouse for its hardware and build quality but if you use it with Synapse 3 then I'd rate it at around 1-2 stars. The software is buggy and causes input drops sometimes the mouse is not recognized by my machine (running Windows 10) after it wakes from sleep etc. I've never had this issue when using with mouse with my Macbook (without any special software) it works great out of the box.
5,the side buttons are really easy to take off and add the other compartments its magnetic and super easy. the mouse has a nice matte feel. its made out of plastic but it doesn't feel sheep at all one of the nicest mice I've bought. no issues so far. The one with 7 buttons has a nice rubber grip in the middle so your thumb doesn't slide around very nice!
3,The reason I'm giving this product a 3 star review is not due to the mouse the mouse is perfectly fine but for the app it uses. If you have a mac OS NEWER than 10.14 the app for programming the mouse will not work for you. You will be basically buying a regular mouse for almost $100 if you have a mac with newer OS. I don't understand how this is even a thing and just like OH woops sorry about it. Honestly don't even bother having a mac extension if it can't be used with updated macs. I'll still keep the mouse because I plan on building a PC but just a fair warning to any mac users.
4,I've had mine for a little over a year and have had only one problem from time to time. Just every once and a while when I am spamming the keys on the side they stop working because the magnets that hold it will let go for a bit. All I do is give it a tap on my desk and it works fine again. So that's why it's only 4 stars but other than that it works flawlessly.
4,I love this mouse for its versatility even if I’m only using the 2 button piece for over 90% of the life span of it.I can’t give it a solid 5 star though bc I will randomly get disconnects even if I’m not swapping the piece. I’ve played games came back a day or two later played good and had to pull off and reconnect the piece for the buttons to be acknowledged. It’s been a while since I’ve had that. But with that being said I would NOT suggest this for a competitive player. I love razer but something that lets you change parts this quick n easy is not something you want to rely on when it’s a intense match
5,I bought this when I had another mouse (a Corsair that double clicked) stop working. I really liked the buttons on this mouse and was thrilled to learn I could choose the buttons that worked for me. I use the 7 button option and I don't even use all of THOSE buttons. You can change the lights on the mouse you can change the buttons and it is a lightweight comfortable mouse to hold. The interchangeable buttons are very easy to swap as well since they are magnetic. It's a very good gaming mouse for someone like me.
5,This is my third Razer mouse I have purchased. The different sides that can switch out make the mouse usable for anything on the computer. I use this one on my work computer and I programmed the side buttons for quick tasks while I am working. It is very helpful. The precision and sensitivity of the mouse is perfect for using three monitors.
3,This mouse works great once it's set up... I spent hours fighting with drivers and firmware updates. This was not a plug-and-play experience for me.
4,Function is great.. using it with MACdownload the software and it got me where I needed to be.Here is the ONE downside... the mouse wheel is so loud!!My previous mouse was not as good but the wheel was smooth and silent..This wheel sounds like your shuffling cards! If you like quite might want to look further.
5,Love it.
4,A little expensive for what it is. Otherwise ok
3,Love the mouse and the versatility of the mouse and different options. Been playing alot of mmo games with alot of buttons so I've mainly used the 12 button attachment. For some reason after a couple months the number 1 button fails to work sometimes even after wiping all contacts and one of my fairly unused buttons. Also when in 2.5 mode for wireless the mouse randomly stops working sometimes even still at 85% life. Not a horrible mouse just feel like I've gotten a problematic one.
5,I never understood why someone would spend so much money on a mouse but this mouse is pretty amazing. I never thought that a mouse would change the way I play games but this has. It comes with different programs to adjust everything to your room's lighting to setting Macros for each of the 3 side plates and optimizing your rig's performance. It's ergonomic design is comfortable and allows for ease of use during quick FPS matches. It comes with a long (looks braided) USB cable which adds to the aesthetic.Razer did a great job on this product and I can't believe I waited this long to get it.
4,The mouse is super comfortable the software is easy to use the buttons feel nice and the lighting is super nice just to look at. The only thing about this mouse that not good is that sometimes (mostly for the 12 grid) the side panel doesn't fully attach and you have to use a little force to make sure all the buttons work. This is a very small inconvenience because it only takes a second to fix and I barely use the 12 grid. If you are an MMO player I doubt you would be using the other panels much so you wouldn't have to deal with this much. This mouse is my favorite mouse and I wouldn't trade it for a different mouse.
5,Of course first thing is the way it feels on your hand. If you get a chance to feel it out definitely do so. It can be a hit or miss depending on how your hand is(size and finger lengths). Not sure why there is a "batter life" rating because I got the wired mouse. I use this for gaming every day! Never get tired.
4,Excellent quality product and great value for the cost. My only complaint is it's a little small for my hands so the thumb buttons aren't optimally positioned and took some adjustment for me to reposition my hand from how i normally hold a mouse.
5,This... THIS freaking mouse... Is AMAZING! 🤩I am aware that this is not necessarily the most powerful mouse when it comes to stats... But I really can't imagine something anyone would need to actually do that this mouse doesn't excel at!The simple fact alone that you can replace pease's of it each that are well made enough to have there own microswich's puts THIS FREAKING MOUSE high at top others that on spreadsheets should outrank it🐀
1,After owning this for just over a month (now for several) the issue started. When I play games or do anything on my desktop with a left click and hold to drag it would sometimes double click the icon instead of holding it. I thought okay I must have slipped my finger like I do occasionally. But this issue persisted in games that I would play that would require me to hold my mouse clicks to change camera views. As the month went on it got worse to the point I knew it wasn't me that was messing it. I would hold the button down hard and or soft both would have the issue. It doesn't do it every time but when it gets going it will double tripple even quad click many many times in a row and it gets very annoying.I have tried using tech support and warranty with #razer and they gave me an option to return the device first then they send a replacement I told them I needed a mouse now and then they gave the option of an advanced replacement. I would have to pay for the mouse first then I would get refunded after mine gets to them. I said "Okay lets do this option how do we get started" I get an email a week later that says due to inactivity we are closing this thread I reopen it asking again what do i need to do to get started another week goes buy with the same message. I ask a third time and the SAME thing happens.I would not recommend another razer product again due to their support.
1,I purchase the Naga X wired mouse and it began failing within 5 months. Windows would not recognize the mouse being plugged in and the color cycling feature would freeze on a single color while flickering. Note: this is a USB Wired mouse so wireless connections are not the issue.  I did the usual troubleshooting fixes found online (drivers firmware synapse etc..) but nothing would work.  I submitted an RMA and razer asked me for poof of mouse not working. Submitted all info requested and included a video showing the disconnect and they still gave me the run around refusing to replace stating a few standard "troubleshooting" suggestions. I found a work around and made it work for 2 more months. Now the mouse is officially dead and not even the work around can save it. Chucking in the trash and moving onto another mouse. NOT razer.
5,@ 1 month: This thing is a beast. On any given day I spend between 10 and 16 hours on my computer so I need peripherals that can keep up. Not only does this bad boy match my pace it's added new tools to my arsenal with endless flexibility and customization options. I'll update this review if/as needed but for now this is my all-time absolute favorite mouse.
5,Longtime PC gamer here. Just buy Razer products for all your peripherals (headphones mice). They’re the best.My last Razer Naga mouse I’d purchased in 2014 and it lasted until 2020 when I broke the left click by dropping a hammer on it by accident. It’s high quality long lasting stuff that’s easy to work with right out of the box.
4,the mouse started moving on its own and now the laser doesn't turn on. It pretty much came out of the box broken.I called Amazon servicing to try and troubleshoot but something inside must not be working I've had this mouse previously and it's never done this before.EDITED got a replacement mouse that seems to be working just fine now. I've changed my stars
1,I just now had to drive to the store for a backup mouse because this mouse suddenly shut off and wouldn't turn back on. The mouse is charged and I tried both wireless and wired updated the drivers reset my PC and the mouse is gone. The light won't turn on and my PC doesn't recognize it.  First red flag was after 3 months of light casual FF14 play the side 12 piece stopped working. I had to changed it to the 6 then that part stopped working so I changed it to the 2 piece.My previous gaming mouse lasted 3 years and I thought this would be an upgrade. How embarrassing.
5,After my old naga died (center mousewheel) I decided to bite the bullet and get a new one. I chose the trinity because it wasn't as expensive as some of the other options yet it still had all of the naga features I wanted and needed. It seems durable and it was an easy transition between the two. Set up is fast and easy and the razer synapse software makes coordinating the mouse with the rest of my PC's lighting very easy. I haven't made use of any of the other grips yet because I love having the numpad by my thumb but I imagine if I wanted to move away from a gaming build that the other grips would come in handy. The RGB lighting is really great as well! Pigmented with a broad range of colors.
3,I've owned two different Razer Nagas in the past the first one being my favorite mouse ever (with the extra buttons on the left mouse click instead of behind the scroll wheel). My 2014 model finally broke and it was time to replace it. The current iteration of the Naga is a sad disappointment. It feels like I have downgraded. It feels and looks cheap. There is no option to switch out the right side panel for a custom grip anymore. It doesn't feel like the high quality product I'd expect from Razer anymore. Sadly this will probably be the last Razer mouse I ever buy.
5,I will say straight out that I use this without it being plugged in.  I also only use it with the 12 button pad.  I will say besides those two caveats this is a truly wonderful product.  I would recommend this to anyone that would only be using with a cord and the 12 buttons since I know these work wonderfully!
4,The mouse is really good quality and the programmable feature is awesome but I only use the 2 button attachment.  The ability to swap the parts out at any moment is awesome in theory but only if you like the feel of them. The other attachments just don't work for me because of how I grip the mouse but if I could get use to them they would be great for MMO's I play.
5,I'll be honest I was a little hesitant to purchase this because it was used but I do not have a single regret. I have been using it for over a month and I love it. The side panels are magnetic so easy to switch out but once they are locked on they do not budge. The size of the mouse is good too as I have small hands it does not feel too large for my hands personally. The Chroma effect on it is bright and colorful and I love the customization for it as it is easy to do. It has made gaming a lot easier for me as I can keybind my hotbar anyway I want to the mouse and all in all recommend this mouse for the reasons stated above.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I'm new into pc gaming and decided to check this mouse out on a recommendation and have to say I absolutely love it. The alternate button attachments are super easy to swap out and fairly easy to use. Overall I would definitely recommend this if you're even slightly considering it. Plus the rgb linked with the blackwidow is almost limitless!
5,This Razer Naga Trinity is the Cadillac of mouses! very fastalmost too fast! the software included is a little bloated but it has a lot of features for a mouse. The 3 magnetic removable button panels are awesome for doing different tasks and it makes gaming a whole lot easier for me. It is expensive but in my opinion it is worth every penny. If you are looking for a quality mouse and are unsure which Razer mouse to get look no further than the Razer Naga Trinity.
3,Purchased this mouse for my wife as she was spending alot of time playing final fantasy and Far Cry where she could use the MMORPG panel that comes with this mouse. It came highly recommended to her from her friends in game due to this feature. Purchased it and she set it up with Razers software to keep the mouse updated. Not even 3 days later the Mouse stopped responding all together. Exchanged the mouse for a replacement and did not download razers software to support the mouse and had no further issues. it is currently still going strong and is a good fit ergonimically for her.
3,Had to return. I am sure it’s not an issue for 90% of the population but as a 6’4 and large framed man with large hands the side buttons were well almost unusable. They are so small and so close together. Not to mention the mouse is HEAVY which makes it hard to move around quickly in a competitive situation like a shooter game.
4,Awesome for wow my dps went waaay up.. you can do 7 bottoms for action games ext then if you wanna play wow or another MMORPG you can have all 12 commands right there. Made the game allot better for me don't have to waste my time clicking on screen commands.. had no idea how much time i was wasting between attacks. Noticibly better at every aspect of fighting.
1,After using this product for less than a week I have come to the conclusion it's uncomfortable and terrible quality. I decided to go with another razer mouse instead. I give it a 3/10 review for this mouse. I don't recommend anyone buying it.
2,My old Naga trinity of 3 years had died (I was not aware of the multi-click issue at the time and so I thought it was the microswitches being worn out) and bought a replacement here in July of 2020. 4 months later (Oct 21 2020) and now this mouse is doing the exact same thing. This is apparently a very common issue with the mouse and can be temporarily fixed by physically blowing into the mouse (apparently it discharges static buildup). This worked for about a week until now the mouse is completely hopeless.The gaming software works great most of the time however it's always had this issue where it will randomly change the DPI/sensisitivy on a whim. The only way to fix it was unplug/replug in the mouse or go into the software under performance and move the DPI setting 1 notch back and forth. This always happened at the worst times during gaming sessions and never left me in a good mood.I love the mouses form factor and the weight is just right but I can't afford to be buying a new mouse every 3 months.
3,The  shipping was good arrived at the estimated time and all the seller is great .that being said the mouse itself is the WORST  DO NOT BUY IT ! Razor has an issue with this mouse a lot of people were complaining about it the mouse just stops working randomly and has a delay in responding to any side click i contacted Razor's team on Reddit  they gave me all what they can come up with I myself tried every possible solution this mouse started acting like this because of the latest Synaps app even though i deleted the app the same thing nothing fixed it after checking here and there  i discovered a lot of people talking about this problem  I ended up just tossing it in the drawer   i gave up after a whole month of trying to fix that problem so you better find another mouse  instead of buying this one. REMEMBER THIS IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE SELLER IT'S RAZOR'S FAULT!
1,TL;DRThis isn't worth nearly the price tag on it.I've used MUCH better gaming nice with better functionality design and overall quality from less flashy brands available right here on Amazon for $75 lessFunctions as described.... but ****REALLY disappointed in the quality of this product.***Years ago I owned a razer naga for MMO's but it died in less than a year. Assumed this company is purely about appearances and moved on now I give razor another try by buying this mouse.But this mouse doesn't even deliver that.Equivalent products are weighted and come with adjustable weights screwed in the bottom this one doesn't and just feels cheap and light and flimsy.Equivalent products have DPI switches you can pre-set and change with a click of a button this has a profile setting on the bottom and requires loads of Razor BloatwareThe number buttons on the side (great for MMO hotbar skills btw) are way too sensitive to pressure and click easily which makes it VERY difficult to grasp and move the mouse. Buttons get clicked just from the pressure of moving the mouse.Packaging is really cheap. Considering that this mouse uniquely requires many different swappable parts how was it not obvious to include at least a basic plastic box?Would be nice to have been offered the same sort of basic carrying accomodations (aka "a box") competitors offer. It's a $70/$100 piece of equipment shipped with cardboard and twist ties and flimsy plastic like an action figure.The LEDs are top notch so the light up colors are pretty....
3,I usually love Razer mice but this is a disappointment. It feels cheap. The scroll wheel is noisy and feels unstable.  and the right button has a tiny bit of play before the click. The keypad isn't in a very good spot either. Reaching buttons 10-12 is so awkward as to make them almost unusable. The software to program it is OK and it does work as expected which is good because the defaults of numbers 1-9 and 0 - and = don't make much sense. I'm going to hang onto it because I've got so much other Razer stuff but I wish I'd gone with the PC Mag reviews and gotten a Logitech.
2,Great feel to use intuitive software with lots of lighting options in the Synapse software. The problem is buttons that relieve frequent use stop responding properly after a while. I had to be conscious about the angle I hit them at. The mose lasted about 4 months before I started having problems.I'm very conflicted about this because while it was working it was amazing and the software was easy and enjoyable to use. Ultimately the price in conjunction with the crap lifespan makes this a product I don't think I can recommend
4,I love this mouse but I only gave it a four star because I dont use the other two side panels just the one with all the numbers. I thought that I would be using them every now and then but since ive gotten the mouse i dont have a use for them. Anyway the mouse in itself is wonderful reacts perfectly fine and you can adjust the sensitivity from very low to very high for adept gamers or the noob.
5,My name is Mason this mouse is a beast I've had quite a few of mice now this one tops all of them some of the mice I've had were the G203 Prodigy Logitech MM710 Cooler Master G300s Logitech Redragon M901 Perdition now I own the Razer Naga Trinity never have had a Razer mouse before this thing is so beast the twelve buttons on the side are clicky easy to press the lighting is beast along with the sensor it's amazing I can hit every shot in Fortnite.
2,I just want a naga that has the same amount of buttons as before and actually registers when I press a button. Randomly the mouse does not detect my buttons I have to smash the buttons for them to work.
3,I bought this mouse for playing ESO so I could have the advantage of being able to strafe and use combat abilities at the same time.  For that purpose this mouse was excellent because one of the side (thumb) plates you can switch out has over 10 buttons so I could map the combat abilities I needed.  However the mouse lasted 11 months before the left click button started registering as a double click rendering the mouse useless for gaming.  I learned this is a common problem with this model which is disappointing considering the purchase cost of the mouse.  It was a great while it lasted but I was hoping to get more than a year out of the product.
2,I have been using the UtechSmart Venus mouse for years and decided it was time for an upgrade. I decided on the Razer Naga Trinity because I thought its different programmable buttons would increase my productivity. Unfortunately upon initial use of this mouse I wanted to return it right away. It was very uncomfortable for me. I thought maybe it was because I have smaller hands but when my brother tried it out he hated it as well. Its stubby form and lack of thumb or pinky rests made it a chore to use. Another reason I wanted to get this mouse was so that I wouldn't have to download another software since I already use Razer products. Sadly I didn't realize that I wouldn't be able to have a combo button with the Window key and a navigation key (to be able to resize windows) which is something I use daily for better productivity on my part. Its uncomfortable form lack of features in the software and price for what I was getting were all reasons why I ultimately decided to return this product after only a couple days of use.
2,The sensitivity jumps randomly. The buttons sometimes don't work. The software is malicious and unlike previous version of this mouse you have to have the software on and updated otherwise features don't work and it won't even retain the color settings. The software is obviously spyware so not only is this overpriced trash but razor makes money from me having it. I spent 100 bucks thinking it's worth the extra money if they treat their workers well and make a quality product. in reality they literally use slave labor in China and it's the quality of a 20 dollar mouse but without the benefit of working all the time. I've been buying razor since 2011 mostly because it looks cool and I'm done. It's a waste of money to reward a bad product and a bad company. I regret buying this garbage.
5,love this mouse!!!I bought the wireless version 5 or 6 years ago. The only problems I had with it was it staying connected. Once I bought this one I was happy. The software is up to date for all my razor gaming equipment.
5,I just dont get the people who diss this mouse about breaking fast. How hard they must have been pressing to be able to break it I cannot imagine. Over the years of my razer naga usage I have never experienced such issues and this mouse is a big upgrade from the previous generation with its clicky mousewheel buttons. I never use the other 2 side options always going for MMO style but if you want to having that option is always good. Tracking is good but make sure to clean the surface and mouse regularly to ensure not having wierd movements which is a must do part on the customer.
5,I like the fact that it comes with 3 different side plates that you can interchange for the type of game you are playing. The buttons are also very smooth and not so clicky when you apply it. also the software for this mouse is pretty neat as you can adjust so much on it including lighting effects.
3,The feel of the mouse is good and the interchangeable side buttons are nice if you can get used to them. I almost never used them personally. The sides of the mouse become hard to grip if your hands sweat as well. I used this almost exclusively for PC gaming up until today. I purchased this mouse in April 2020 and now (almost exactly 8 months later) the switch for the left mouse button is misbehaving. I can no longer hold a left click reliably and the mouse randomly double clicks when I only press the button once. Now I'm shopping for a new mouse once again.
1,This mouse is one of the worst products I've ever had the misfortune of using in my entire life. The problems started almost immediately when I bought the mouse. Random disconnecting and issues with the software. Now I'm lucky if half the mouse works at any given moment. Disconnect issues. Button issues. Sometimes I have to click a button 3-4 times to get it to actually work. It's been nothing but pain and suffering the entire time I've used it. In my opinion save yourself the trouble and buy any other brand MMO mouse.
5,Had my last Naga for like 9 years so it was about time for an upgrade and I prefer the feel of this one being so much bigger. I haven't been using it enough to really speak to its durability in comparison to my last but I'm very happy with it atm
5,I used the naga 2014 for like 3 years from mmo to fps the 12 buttons is overkill. I play call of duty now days. my macro set up is insane with my left hands all I need is to use shift control q w e a s d f and space. I reload meele crouch use equipment shoot aim.
4,This mouse has my absolute favorite side button layout; a 7-button circle. So it pains me when it decides not too many months later to start not properly left-clicking. This has been a constant problem to me with razer mice and it's too bad.
1,Bought the mouse for my partner because they loved the Naga X and it's been years since they've had it so I decided to get them the Trinity for some variety. I kept getting the same defect right out of the box. The scroll wheel is able to physically scroll up and down but there is NO response. If I were to scroll through a chat webpage etc. the screen would not move HOWEVER the scroll wheel clicks work. I place an order for a replacement and the second one comes in with the same issue except this one can actually scroll down (not up though). The third one I was unable to get a replacement for and instead was told to request a refund and place an entire new purchase so I did. SAME. EXACT. ISSUE. No scroll response just like the first one. I already contacted Razer about it and went through all their troubleshooting steps (all of which I already did) and was just told it was a hardware defect. They said they'd replace it but saw I bought it from Amazon and said they weren't an approved reseller even though I was directed to this page from the dropdown link on their main website (also listed was Best Buy and Walmart) so I'd have to request a 4th replacement from Amazon instead. Absolutely terrible.
5,The mouse is very easy to use. It comes with 3 sides that you can installed easily. The bottom mouse has a pull and it feels like it is magnet. You can easily take it off without any screw driver. You just use light force to pull it off and insert which ever that best is use for your gaming pc.
2,It's a really cool mouse that fits big hands like mine really well. But in the enthusiast peripherals market we have come to expect quality and reliability. Both my Corsair Dark Core and Iron Claw have been working perfectly for years. Whereas the interchangeable buttons on this thing have pretty much quit working after only 6 months of moderate use. Cant recommend it doesn't meet what I would consider to be minimal requirements of reliability.
5,super
4,The mouse is a bit big than what I usually used. I've been using Razer mices for years and since I felt the need of using a lot of buttons I gave it a try. It's very easy to use although sometimes Razer Synapse 3 is a pain especially when using it for macro. Switching is a bit hard too because the side plates are a bit stuck you'll need longer nails to remove them. Definitely not for lefties.
3,The mouse is a great concept. It comes with Synapse which is a very useful software suite for making keybindings and macros. However as I have had this mouse it has become increasingly more difficult to press some side buttons. Also many months ago it started failing to hold clicks and sometimes creates a double click. I have read other low-star reviews and they are all correct. I've also talked to a few people who also have clicking problems with razer products.Granted and this is why I am giving 3 stars I have put thousands of hours on this mouse via gaming and it has declined gradually starting around probably the 4-month mark.
3,This mouse is great for any MMO or shooter because you're able to switch the buttons on the fly. However A few months into having it I have noticed that when I click and hold the left mouse button it will not stay held. If you click to drag it will stop dragging if you're firing a gun in a game it will fire one bullet and stop because it registers it as a click instead of a hold. It comes and goes and sometimes it's worse than other days. Obviously this can be a HUGE annoyance. I would say 90 percent of the time though the mouse works fine. But that ten percent can get you killed sometimes.
5,Pros+ Responsive clicks; smooth scrolling+ Adjustable DPI with the Razer interface is a really easy setup & the buttons below the scroll allow you to switch DPI profiles (1-4) that you setup (I also find adjustable DPI to be a useful concept for decreasing reaction time in games).Cons- Had issues with configuring one of the side plates (numbered 1-9 plate); seems like it could be faulty.- Price-point is higher than a deathadder; might deter budget PCs.
5,this mouse is unlike any other besides the Naga Pro. The hump is shifted more towards the back of the mouse instead of the middle or front. It fits my hand really well and has great software support from Razer. Will likely buy another at some point because I found "my" mouse.
5,So I'm an odd gamer that keeps using things for work. Love the number pad on the side for not only gaming but not needing to jump around a num pad - or laptops that don't have one. Reactive and easy to use. Software is a must for sensitivity tweaking but not intrusive and just honestly sits there.
3,Brand new pc from the ground up. The buttons on this mouse randomly stop working mid game which requires you to turn it off and back on again. Sometimes not even that works.Battery life is amazing.
3,This mouse functioned just fine but it was a bad choice for me. Way too big and uncomfortable for my hand and I have large hands.I wanted it for video editing with Adobe Premiere but as I tried to get used to this mouse I kept regretting my purchase. After a week or so I returned it and bought a similar (but smaller) Logitech mouse. Much better for me.So the three stars reflect my rating of the mouse my own use not the overall quality of the mouse. If you're a gamer this mouse be perfect for you.
4,This is the best wired Naga yet but it is  missing one of the two buttons below the scroll wheel.  Unfortunate decision that tarnishes an otherwise fantastic product.
1,I just bought this mouse and I thought it would be great. I love the idea of not having to switch mice but instead switch the panel. It's high dpi which is great for FPS but the button panels allow it to be used in a variety of games which require different button configurations.Unfortunately the problem lies in what makes this mouse unique: the buttons on the panels do not always respond. I cannot place what the exact issue is but some people have issues with the panel physically connecting to the mouse and some (including myself) have issues with the prongs not registering the information between the panel and the mouse. My mouse will light up indicating that the panel is connected but the buttons will not always register while I am pressing them. Sometimes the mouse works great and other times it will register a click once every 10 or more presses. It is very frustrating and essentially ruins the whole point of having the different side panels.I stopped buying Razer products years ago because I had issues with their products. And go figure I'm having problems with the first product I bought from them since within the first day or two of buying it. This only reaffirms my decision to avoid their products.Update: Continued using this mouse since writing this review originally and I am returning it and dropping this from 2 stars to 1. I am having problems with the side buttons not working consistently and it is ruining my gaming experience. I am going back to the Logitech G600 which I have bought a few times prior to this purchase and it excels in many ways compared this this mouse. Plus the G600 fits my larger hand better than the naga does which is important in long gaming sessions.I had high hopes for the trinity and they were misplaced.
1,I loved this mouse. Then suddenly one day i went to charge it and it started flashing really fast in a single color. I had it set to match the keyboard. I went to use it and it hitched every couple of seconds and clicked the mouse button. I tried all the tricks found online and nothing. Now it doesn't even work when plugged in. Don't bother unless you like buying a new mouse all the time.
3,I love the swappable side buttons on the mouse for gaming but that is all this mouse has going for it. For a $70 mouse you would expect at least a year of use before it becomes unusable. The severely persistent double click and inability to hold down the Left Mouse Button in a First Person shooter game makes this mouse almost impossible to recommend. If you need this mouse for the uniqe side button configurations it provides then I implore you to purchase the extended warranty so you don't have to go through Razers unhelpful customer service department when your mouse stops working.
5,I'm on my computer all day for work gaming streaming etc. Its comfortable the buttons all work well its easy to control. Had my last naga for around 10 years and this one seems just as good.
3,I got this mouse to replace my 5 year old Naga that finally died.  Right off the bat this Naga Trinity felt a little cheaper but as it cost less I was 100% ok with it.  Now a couple months after light use it has developed the issue of double clicking with one press of the button.  I pulled it apart cleaned it and it still has the issue.  The razer software also has some issues but you can just remove it to get rid of the conflicts.All in all a decent mouse but I think I lost the lottery on getting one that will last.
2,Update:  The mouse isn't actually fine.Now randomly some (?) of the buttons on the 6 button panel will just stop working.  Button 5 will decide to do nothing unless I either plug it in or pop the panel on/off.  Not really convenient when you're in the middle of something.  Avoid this mouse and Razer not worth the headache.This is the newer "improved" Naga Pro Wireless not the Trinity.  Most of the bad reviews on this page are for the Trinity but the Naga Pro Wireless deserves them too.-----------------Synapse begged me to make a Razer Account for months.  I finally did and my reward was a complete reset of my mouse settings.  Awesome!Now I'm lucky if I go a week without having to re-install Synapse and reboot two times for it to see the mouse and load the bindings.  The mouse hardware is good but the software and drivers are the absolute worst.
2,I wish this mouse would have been good.  It's ergonomic and great has a long battery life from what I can tell but it comes with a slew of issues that should not be necessary.  How does USB using the signal range of that as Wifi make any sense?  It completely makes the signal unbearably choppy.  The Bluetooth keeps disconnecting.  You can play wired... but if I wanted a wired mouse I would have stuck with my old one.4
1,I bought this replace my Naga 2014 the bottoms were finally starting to stick. Anyway I love razer but was unsure after reading reviews on the Trinity. The first mouse was broken a large crack on the left click  I processed an exchange and got the second one. I ended up returning it before true month was up it was not the quality I expected from razer and was exactly what everyone said it was.Thoughts:It felt good ergonomically - goodIt was a lot lighter than my Naga - good at first annoying after a weekThe attachable keypad had not trouble connecting to my computer the first time....Let’s talk detachable keypad- that uses magnets.While I was playing my dog licked my hand and the keypad bounced off (great idea using magnets) it fell onto the floor where it shot under the sofa. I got it back and went to reattach it and discovered the mouse was still functioning which seems strange I attached the keypad and the whole computer froze because it thought new hardware had been attached... because my dog licked my hand... a normal experience no rough housing or banging just “pop” now your entire game and pc are frozen. Only saving grace is I had not joined the trial group yet so my half hour quest to get the pc and mouse to talk did not disturb anyone else...The new razer software that it had to have would not stop updating... every time I turn on the pc.It turned out that the slightest shift in my hand and the keypad would pop off but I learned if you snapped it back on it right away it only took 5min to reconnect.... and that’s helpful right?I returned the mouse and bought another brand. Sorry Razer but the trinity is terrible.
2,$150 is highway robbery for this mouse. I've ordered two in the past year (both for under $100) and one has had wireless disconnect issues where it'll freeze for 5 seconds randomly while in use be weary.
5,Get the dock this mouse is way better if it's got the dock. I just leave it on and drop it on the dock when I step away. It's always charged and connects so fast you don't even notice it. The Bluetooth works great but takes a couple seconds to connect.I don't use the software I think that's what's wrong for most people.
3,so my son bricks one every 10 months like clock work only stays with it for so many years is Finger memory finally talked him to changing brands and style so going with Gpc D-
3,This was supposed to replace a Logitech g600 MMO mouse. I bought a Black Widow keyboard and love it to pieces. Having the lights/colors and such sync up was a nice prospect.Buuut there's one thing I got really attached to the extra button (Where the ring finger sits) on the g600 (Logitech called it the 'g-shift' button). It doesn't have it on this mouse. I feel that the Razer isn't as durable feeling as the Logitech too. I've transported my Logitech everywhere had it bump against walls fall on the floor etc.... still working well after all the years I'd had it (aside from occasionally clicking extra times which warranted my needing to replace it).  I don't think I'd be able to get away with that on this mouse.This mouse is still great in having a very quick response time the button layouts/macro abilities and such. The side panel doesn't have any issues on being replaced for more/less buttons. I was just too used to the extra ring finger button.
5,Plates are easy to swap out but the six button plate really does it for me. 12 button plate makes it a bit hard to locate the button properly. Great product no complaints so far.
5,I was looking for an MMO mouse that also happen to be wireless since I really like my desk to be wire free. Also I really like this mouse for all of the custom parts that come with it. The only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't use USB-C.
3,It's tracking seems a little crappy from I the price but the number keypad is still decent to use....we see I bet it breaks in 2 years just like last I one
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I had the 2014 Naga for the longest time ever and it finally stopped working recently I looked everywhere for one that was new and not refurbished because I know for a fact it was the best mouse I have ever had but had zero luck finding it since it was discontinued.Some differences I noticed is that this one is not as heavy and more rounded compared to the 2014 Naga which I didn't mind at all the side buttons are really easy to switch and are held on magnetically they stick pretty good in place and I have had zero issues with it.**Note: This razer uses a different software than the old Naga it uses synapse 3 and not synapse 2. I was really confused as to why synapse wouldn't detect it well that was why.Update:After several months of using this it started double and triple clicking. It was still in warranty so I turned it in for a new one but after a couple of months this new one is having that same issue again. I take good care of my items and have never dropped it before incase some may think it is user issue.
4,A solid mouse especially depending on the type of games you intend to play you have multiple options to change the experience. The material is nothing special and often I find myself only using one of the side panels for gaming (but that's more of a preference) I'd say it's worth getting If you play a variety of games with different hotkey bindings.
5,I like everything about it.. a little sad only the 12 button is the one with RGB
5,I use this mouse both for gaming and regular day to day use and it’s fantastic. Comfort is extremely important to me since I have fibromyalgia and my hands cramp regularly this was an awesome upgrade for me
5,I made the change from Razer to Corsair since I heard a lot of great things about Corsair and was that a mistake. My Corsair mouse broke within a year. Bought a the Razer Naga Trinity and have not have any issues since. If you're deciding between those two definitely go Razer you won't regret it.
3,Buttons are in weird places and difficult to reach. The 12 key component is cool but I don't play mobas. Would not recommend for fpses where you need more than 2 side buttons
4,Really enjoying this as a replacement for my previous gen Naga (mostly for use in WoW). Haven't had any problems with the scroll wheel and I use it for binds (up down shift up shift down control up control down and click).The only small problem I have is the left mouse button clicks slightly softer than the right one the feedback isn't as good. That being said everything else has been great thus far. Had a slight problem installing the software ended up terminating a process during the installation to get it from stalling. Macros had to be setup again took 15-20mins. Overall I would recommend.
5,This is a major upgrade from the Razer Naga. The swappable side plates are very handy and easy to use and it feels good in my hand. It is a bit on the heavy side though.
5,Bought as a gift for Christmas although has been on my wish list for a while. Came fast and packaged very well. The product is made well. Very easy to switch between the different sides. Nice finger rest on the side during gaming. If you like razer or have a similar style mouse this is a great buy.
2,As the headline says mouse started scrolling up non stop. Only way to fix it was to disable scroll up function in Razer software. Another issue I just dealt with(straight out of the box) as it was intermittent was the constant disconnect of the mouse. Mouse would disconnect randomly while doing anything. Saw the reviews about this mouse and still bought it because its the only "quality" wireless keypad mouse. DO NOT recommend if you are fine with a wired version. Corsair Scimitar is 10/10 perfect if you don't mind the cord.
5,This is my second Naga my first was the fixed 12 button version.  The trinity is fantastic.  Being able to swap the sides is a game changer.  12 buttons are the best for Warcraft but are a pain when I'm doing anything else.  I've had it for months now and it seems to be holding up as well as the one I had for 8 years.
1,I've been using Razer gaming mice (mouses?) for years and years. I've been thinking about switching from them over the last few models as the quality has been decreasing and there's more competition for the amount of buttons I want. This is the one that has finally convinced me.Besides the fact the new program is a lot clunkier than 2.0 was (I liked just being able to right click the icon in the tray to switch to a different gaming profiles whereas now I have to open the app especially if I use one profile for multiple games and occasionally would have to close the app and reopen just to get it to work) the mouse itself has been unusable.I received the mouse promptly May 14th (2019). I felt the clicking was a little off but I always feel that way with a new mouse so I didn't think too much about that. Then it would sometimes unclick/reclick while holding down a button. Now it sometimes doesn't even click and sometimes the side buttons act like the mouse buttons instead of what they're programmed to do. This is all within 2 months of getting the mouse with the same amount of use I used every mouse before. I can't hold down a button at all anymore which means I can't even drag windows from one monitor to another. I've followed troubleshooting for it which is to try closing the program and reopening uninstalling and reinstalling and most of all cleaning the mouse with air to make sure there's nothing blocking the contacts.It even sometimes gets "locked" in a program and won't click on anything else until I reset it. All in all I'd rather use my IBM mouse from 1995 with the slow movement than this until my new mouse comes in which is not a Razer.
5,Battery life not relevant because the mouse had a unattachable cord. I wouldn't buy any other mouse for mmo gaming. Razor always has a quality product. I would buy again and again
2,This is the SECOND Razer mouse I have purchased and this one is worse than the first. It starts off great...does what it's supposed to works as it's supposed to. Then the degradation in performance on daily operations starts. Can't click on objects or "hold" to drag and drop; can't highlight lines without losing what you've highlighted and jumped to another completely different line; right button won't function 50% of the time.Razer's solution? Use a Q-tip with rubbing alcohol to clean the lens. Uhm sure Razer...that's going to fix the issue. Of course it didn't. Uninstall and reinstall their worthless software...still no better. Just submitted an issue ticket with Razer after having enough of this piece of c**p.Pros...it looks cool with my other Razer products (Firefly mouse page and headset).Cons...everything else.Take a chance and roll those dice when purchasing mice from Razer...some people luck out others well not so much.
5,Pros:Covers all my gaming needsWorks great and without issuesBraided cableA lot of value for the moneyHas the right weight and shape for my hand (user feel may vary based on hand size and weight desire)Cons:WiredOnly for right handed players
1,There's a hardware defect that affects the mouse button click. It took me only a little while of searching online to find that this is a problem others had found and I confirmed it was a hardware issue after running some tests recommended in the forums. In my case it was the right mouse click. I tried going through customer service letting them know I had already done all the regular steps and identified the issue. Literally each exchange was with a different representative who did not read the original ticket or subsequent explanations. Perhaps they hired out to some low quality customer service company because rather than answering me like a person they literally copy pasted generic responses over and over again despite me repeatedly trying to explain what the issue was.  In my last response (it had been about a month of generic canned responses) I wrote that I was very disappointed that the multiple people assigned to my ticket were clearly not reading my responses and kept copy pasting in pre-made responses and that I would be leaving a bad review for the product not purchasing anything from them again and that they could please close the ticket. Guess how yet another new customer service representative responds? You guessed it copy pasted response that ignored everything I said. I ignored that last one and haven't heard anything from them since. The mouse was great while it worked but based on my customer experience I would not recommend this product at all.
4,the mouse works great & having an extra 12 buttons to bind is extremely useful. my only issue with the mouse is that i tend to bump it on the keyboard rest and accidentally trigger a bind but that's not really the mouse's fault as much as my own clumsiness. great mouse worth the money.
3,it's a mouse.... nothing special.. LMB nd RMB are loud probably the loudest of any mouse I've ever owned... it's comfortable at least side buttons feel ok. honestly haven't used anything but web searching but I imagine for gaming it'll be good. biggest issue is the noise and the DPI settings are dumb either too fast or too slow. nothing good in between. colors are nice but who cares it's colors... in terms of comfort and use it's good. Would give more stars but the noise is just too annoying
3,Mouse works as expected but the software is a PAIN. It messes up my scroll speed unless I have the Razr software open.
4,Liked the mouse so much I gave it to my friend and purchased a Gpro wireless. Good for gaming but it didn't fit my hand fun while I had it though.
5,Love at 1st sight. Great for MMOs specially for Final Fantasy 14.
2,It does the job of being a good mmo mouse until a few months in when buttons just stop working. I have to give it a light smack in order for the buttons to work again. This is unacceptable for a mouse of this price and I would not recommend buying it.
3,Requires their software to work or base function of the mouse will be impacted. Very different handfeel and DPI from the great 2014 model but more or less feels the same role. I'm alright with it as a replacement but I miss the older model's slimness greatly. Side keyboard magnetically snaps in place to swap out the sides which is really neat but can come loosened which my small brain mistook as part failure instead of just needing to realign the leads.
5,I game a lot on my days off and so far have gone 2 days of forgetting to charge without the battery running out super great battery life amazing for gaming so much customization I love it
2,I purchased my Naga Pro about 5 months ago and it was working great at first.  The mouse can be used with the 2.4 wireless Bluetooth or even when charging via the USB cable. Battery life is very good and the unit is built solid.  My problem is not with the unit but the customer service of Razor and the horrible process they have to repair the products. Basically if the unit has issues you will be without one for several weeks. I guess if I had bought a cheap mouse I would not have an issue with that but with the cost of the mouse's two RC30 charging units it seems to me that they would have a better repair policy.  you can pay for an advance replacement (refundable in about two weeks) but then I'm essentially paying for another mouse and maybe that is a better option.
5,Great mouse. Coming from the razer mamba its a little jaring at fist. But absolutely love how heavy it is and the bottons are way easier to use than i originally expected. Not a very big learning curve at all. The swapple buttons are amazing for gaming and work. All around 100% satisfaction
5,Excelente desempeño muy practico por la forma de intercambiar la botonera. Buena calidad
3,I bought this mouse because I owned it's predecessor for 5 years and the old mouse was a godsend for playing online MMO's. Material quality is great. Battery life is a non issue as this is a plug in model. When I pulled it out of the box I was excited about the three options and ended up choosing my tried and true favorite the 12 side button input. I  installed it loaded my game and was ready for a great night of gaming. I was quickly disappointed to find that the design was significantly larger than its predecessor. My small hand continually slides off of the mouse and my reach to the thumb buttons is terrible! Why Razer would you not consider smaller hands in the creation of this product?! I'm so disappointed with it I've been using it for a couple months now and I have not gotten used to it or adapted! This is just a poorly designed product for smaller hands.
5,Amazing mouse!
2,I bought this for WoW Classic when it came out and after a few months I noticed the LMB was double-clicking and not registering me holding it down. After a quick google search I found that other people are having the same issue and it appears to be a faulty micro-switch. This is just another example of Razer skimping on quality to make a quick buck by using cheap parts that ultimately break after regular use. Razer must be secretly be competing with Apple on profit margins because they overprice the hell out of their poorly made cheap plastic crap and boost their profits by practically forcing customers to buy extended warranties. Yeah that's what I want to do be without the thing I use every day while I wait for Razer to send me another ticking-time-bomb of a product. Honestly Razer's reputation with me has sunk so low which is a shame because their product design and functionality is the only reason I continue to buy their stuff.
1,I bought this mouse as an upgrade from my 2014 Naga when one of the buttons stopped working after years of use; however have found this product to not be a suitable replacement. The change in shape from previous 12 button Razer mice makes it so that I am unable to access the functions of three of the buttons that I use most frequently. In comparison to the 2014 Naga hand placement on the 10 11 and 12 buttons my thumb now barely reaches the 78 and 9 with the same positioning. The new shape whereas the top of the mouse is now rounded towards the front rather than under the palm of your hand also forces my hand into an unnatural position that causes cramping and makes the mouse very uncomfortable to use.As for function I assume it would continue to work just as well as my older mouse however due to the fact that I am unable to get more than five minutes of use out of the product at a time I am unsure of its longevity. Getting set up to play/ use the mouse was also a huge pain. Razer Synapse would not recognize that the product existed even after registering it under warranty under the account that Synapse is linked to. After completely purging my computer of all Razer software and re-downloading it the mouse finally worked and was programmable-however it unregistered my keyboard and all other Razer hardware in the process and forced me to reinstall and reprogram everything.Over all I would not recommend this product to anyone with small hands. I think in trying to create a product that combined several different side plates/faces they gave up the integrity that allowed the three separate mice to function and be used in a comfortable manner.
5,6 side button option and wireless is the best experience I've had playing ESO.One ding for the ergonomic factor which I wish was more like the Razer Hyperspeed Basilisk - this mouse doesn't support the base of the palm as well as the cheaper one does. But so far its been way more reliable than the HSB.
2,I had been using my Razer naga since 2013 and it was having problems after almost 6 years. I am super happy with it but Razer doesn't make them anymore. The closest thing I can find on the market is the trinity with the number pad on the left side of the mouse. I am having problems with the number pad from time to time. Sometimes during gaming it would just stop working and I have to remove it and put it back several times for it to become responsive again.This other thing is this mouse is not exactly cheap so I am a bit disappointed at the quality Razer delivers.You can tell the material they use on this thing is not as good as they used to be. It just feels like plastic all the way.There are other well known brands that offer mice with number pad and I think this is my last mouse purchase with razer.  Overall I am not happy with the mouse (I bought it on prime day for a discount so there is that)If it is not discounted I would not have bought it at all.I am going to try other brands and see how that are (and they are cheaper as well)
5,Once you get used to all the extra buttons on it it's a pretty good mouse. I like that I can use it wireless or wired. The synapses app that goes along with it makes it a fantastic gaming mouse and regular PC mouse
2,third naga lesson learned.After about 6 months left click begins to double or triple click making it very difficult to press and hold drag windows or highlight.I'd consider this mouse unreliable especially for the price. go elsewhere for a mmo mouse
5,You wont find better for your computing needs.
4,More useful than anticipated.  Reconfiguration not needed when swapping panels.  Impressed my gaming buddies by not always being bait now.  Haha
1,Absolute waste of money. This mouse worked fine for a month. After that the buttons randomly wouldn’t click. I could spam and press them for hours and nothing. I find a solution online which is to update the soft ware directly from razors website. What it does tell you is that if you do that then it no longer connects to the hopper so it’s no longer wireless. Not to mention it’s a temporary fix because the buttons WILL STILL STOP WORKING OFTEN ENOUGH TO WRITE A REVIEW ABOUT IT! Worst investment in my life
1,The different mouse numpads that come with this mouse do not work correctly. The mouse 'numpad' buttons are connect to other 'numpad' buttons. ex. pressing '1' will result in an output of '321' if you use their software to change the macro for the button to press 'f' it will result in pressing '32f'. There is no fix for this and you cannot get support from Razer.
3,Looks nice seems to work well.  Do not buy if you use 2.4 GHz wifi and can't connect to it with Bluetooth.  The Naga's wireless dongle wrecks my laptop's wifi reception.  I've been dying for a good wireless MMO mouse but this is useless to me.
5,Upgraded from an old Razer Naga which developed the double clicking issue after 8 years of use. Great battery life if you keep lights off which I do. The mmo plate did have oddly tilted keys which took a little getting used to but once you do it helps you keep track of where your thumb is.
5,Good mouse when you use it you don't wanna go back to any normal mouse first it hurts my pinky because I used to use a huge mouse but I gave it 2 days and I'm used to it perfectly now it even works very nice if you don't like to use a mouse pad just on any surface
5,Me ha gustado mucho este mouse con sus diferentes laterales aunque la verdad no uso mucho el que es recomendado para los mobas muy practico para juegos como wow y tambien sirve para jugar juegos como warzone aunque es un poco pesado para este tipo de juegos.
4,This mouse has a crazy amazing of bindings.  Only problem is the click normally gets messed up over a 12 month period and careful the warranty can run out right when you need it. Get plan with.
5,The laser is very responsive. The customization is well worth the money. Having the side buttons makes gameplay a lot more enjoyable. My fiancé plays WoW Ark: Survival Evolved From the Depths and similar games. He loves it. He's used this mouse for years but we lost it when we moved across the country so we had to buy a new one. He bought the last one more than 3 years ago and it was still going strong.
3,Was looking for my old Molten Naga mouse to use instead of my Old Republic mouse since middle mouse wasn't working well anymore but I couldn't find it so I decided to buy a new Naga. I just kind of assumed that the two buttons behind the scroll wheel were "Mouse 4" and "Mouse 5" since that's what they were on my last mouse. Turns out they adjust my DPI which is most unfortunate for me. No 12 buttons on the side isn't enough. I've used Mouse 4 and 5 for years in WoW. Sure there's the mouse 4 and 5 side but I rather like having the 12 button side and the two extra mouse buttons. I decided to forgo installing Synapse with the mouse before discovering what the DPI buttons were and now I  can't access Razer's website at all to download it.The 12 buttons are also too sensitive. Very easy to bump them and activate them when you don't intend to. Previous Nagas I've owned were a lot harder to accidentally press the buttons on the sides.
5,It is my 2nd one! The first still good just looks old so purchased the same! Very good gaming partner!
5,Last one just died after 10 years of daily use. Enough said.
5,Love this mouse. This is my third Naga and will happily buy again. The replaceable sideplates are really nice and makes for a great MMO or FPS mouse.  Only issue I had was with some freezing issues( stuttering ) . But this was resolved with using a USB port on the motherboard and not an extension.
2,After less than a year my naga (barely used in perfect condition) has started double clicking. No big deal it happens.I contacted customer support which had to be through submitting a ticket which then moved to emails.They asked for normal details and went through a list of things for me to try such as blowing it out with a duster deleting their mouse software reinstalling drivers & trying on another PC.After letting them know I had already completed their troubleshooting techniques they sent another email. This time asking for an attachment of proof of purchase "from a store". As well as "a video showing the issue of the double clicking with the SN visible.At the end of the day I just wanted an $80 mouse replaced with one that works correctly. Instead they exhaust you in every way possible as if it's a $20k product.I did love the mouse initially but I urge you to buy a similar mouse from a company with better customer service.
5,I purchased a used naga because it was only about 35 dollars and I have to say I am very very pleased. It came in the original packaging everything neatly packed and pristine. The mouse have a little bit of finger residue since it was used but after cleaning it with some rubbing alcohol it looks 100% brand new. no scratches works perfectly and completely surpassed my expectations. I was expecting something scary but got something way way worth the gamble! Beautiful amazing working mouse!
3,This mouse developed a double-click issue that is apparently common to some Razer mice.I've used Razer products for gaming for years. I've owned a Mamba 2 Deathadders (including the Chroma) and a Huntsman Elite keyboard. 14 months ago I decided to get this mouse for work. Both of my Deathadders had this issue. The Naga Trinity started doing this a few weeks ago. It's a shame because I like the mouse for the customization. The wireless version just came out and I'm going to have to give that one a hard pass. Shame.
2,After owning this for a couple months now I believe and switching to the circular thumb button setup I am fed up. I cannot believe this was designed with horizontal lines for "grips". I cannot get ahold of this mouse and it made something as silly as Fallout 76 a pain to play. The texture is dry and super fine on the mouse itself which makes it hard to grip with dryer hands as well. The side grips are simply un-usable though and I am wishing I had sent this back long ago. I will be getting an MX Master.
2,It was awesome and worked as intended thought I finally purchased something smart and investment-worthy. For the last 2 months I've been having issues with the left mouse click being held down. when it started happening frequently enough for me to actually notice I thought maybe a hair or something in the optical lense sure enough but that wasn't the issue another week or so and it's getting worse. Unable to click and drag to copy and paste unable to hold down left mouse click to aim. Turns out the clicker is going out. Now I game a lot and work from home so my pc is well used I know mice have a set lifespan but I don't know if I have gone through so many clicks that I've worn out the left click. Makes me sad I thought this brand was trustworthy.
5,Love it!  Weight reduction compared to other 12 button mice.  The clicks feels a lot better because gen 2 optical clicks.  100% mouse feet makes the glide much more smooth.  Better than every way than the corsair scimitar pro rgb that it replaced.
5,I play FFXIV with this mouse and I love it.This mouse is so good I have one for my home PC and another for my travel laptop.The software that Razer gives you is very customisable and allows you to sync everything from one computer to another.Also macros execute flawlessly and are also easy to setup.The 3 different button plates are nice but I only use the circle one (I only need 5 of the side buttons).The only negative I can think of is that you have to re-calibrate the lift distance every now and again but this isn't a deal breaker at all.Great mouse.
2,I think the build quality of this mouse is pretty great and I had no problems with the software.But! Its pretty much completely ruined by its shape. The top is totally convex so when gaming when I try to quickly pick it up to to move to the side it just drops out of my hand if I'm not gripping it tightly unlike my previous mouse it was meant to replace (logitech g700) which had a very comfortable groove along the thumb side which allowed it to be picked up easily.Gripping it tightly enough to pick it up wouldn't be such an issue if the side buttons weren't there but as it is I need to have my thumb curled inward to be able to hit the buttons making me unable to grip the mouse at the same time.Somewhat more of a personal problem but I have large hands and the position of thumb buttons are  too far back making me curl my thumb somewhat uncomfortably to be able to hit them.
1,I thought this mouse would be great since I switch from playing shooters and MMOs and having multiple different buttons layouts would be great. In reality though the interchangeable sides create problems a normal mouse wouldn't have and it severely outweighs the advantages.Because of the design occasionally your side mouse buttons will not register. There has been countless times when I am fighting in a game and press a side mouse button to use a healing item and it simply doesn't register until I press it multiple more times. It's insanely frustrating to constantly be losing fights because your mouse doesn't work like it should.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The Ergonomic of the mouse is quite good. BUT the left and right buttons are rattles like crazy every time I try to click on something or life up the mouse.
3,The mouse is of great quality and has many features to boast about; however I personally do not care for the button layout. Even after a couple months of practice I still find myself becoming confused in the middle of my gaming due to the lack of tactile button identification---that is the buttons all feel the same and I lose where my thumb is pushing unless I look at my mouse. I suppose I should thank the company though because since switching to this mouse I have canceled all my game subscriptions as a result of butchering too many skill combos and blowing large cooldowns thanks to a misclick #therageisreal. I'll be purchasing another mouse in the near future as this one (and the other two interchangeable pads) just don't cut it for me. Ultimately disappointed in this purchase.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I had this mouse since October 2019 (now February 2021). The left mouse button is failing and results in double clicking.  I'm on the market for a different mouse as a result of this double clicking issue. Search forums and the double clicking is a reported issue.  If you absolutely love this mouse then buy extra to swap it out with a fresh one when it starts acting weird. The mouse tracks fine the mouse wheel works as expected and the right mouse button is also operating as expected.
3,This is a great mouse with tremendous functionality for MMO gaming as well as for professional/business applications as well.The interchangeable side panels is a great feature if you'd like to swap them out for style or application preferences.I have had two previous iterations of the Naga mouse and my Naga 2014 felt more robust than the current version. For MAC USERS: Razer offers NO support for OS Catalina users. If you want the full and very dynamic full utility (Synapse 2-3 or the Chroma controls) of this or any other Razer products you'll need Windows.
5,I have had 3 of these and now a 4th (pro wireless) version.Super comfortable: ergonomic design prevents wrist pain or fatigue.Super adaptable: The 3 interchangeable plates allow so much customization and allow for an easy advantage in many gamesBest mouse I have or will ever own.
5,I freaking love this mouse. I’ve always used a cheap weighted mouse because it was affordable and had 12 buttons with a good finger layout. I was concerned that my pinky might rub against the mat but there is some rubber there that prevents this and provides a great grip/feel for this light weight mouse. Best 12 button I’ve used. Worth the price.
1,I don't leave reviews but I just thought people who sorted through latest reviews at this current time would like to know the BS I've been through with this mouse and what they might also experience as well.100% HonestyLikes:- Lots of customization throughout Synapse/swappable thumb buttons.- Braided cableDislikes:-Synapse will work when it wants to most of the time it'll reset your DPI settings instead.-Mouse's left-click last a solid 3 months before I started getting double clicking or no clicks at all.-The thumb grips have some really slippery rubber so if your thumb gets even the slightest bit of sweaty you're gonna have a hard time holding a grip.Easy and simple likes/dislikes. I'm currently going on 4 days of back and forth emails with the support team in trying to get an RMA going for this mouse and it's been hoop after hoop after hoop...now I'm required to send video proof of the mouse double clicking/not registering a click.What happened to "if it's broke we'll fix it!" mentality from companies of old lol? Customer's satisfaction is not Razer's strong suite. All in all buyer beware.
2,They removed two keys from near the left-click on the Naga that were amazing to have.  I can't find that mouse anymore but I miss them.  12 on the side is great but having those additional keys was super nice for MMORPGs.The sensitivity buttons are useless for me and were constantly being triggered when using the mouse wheel.  I finally figured out how to disable them in Synapse (which required me to make an account - super annoying) - but more importantly they are not sized well for regular use.The 12 keys on the side are only 'OK' - they changed the feel of the keys from the older Naga that I was used to and the new ones feel cheaper and don't have the dot on the #5 key to identify where your thumb is.
5,I have been using Razer mice for 5 years now I have had Razer Naga Chroma Razer Naga Epic Chroma and now this Razer Naga Pro which is simply fantastic. It is very smooth precise and its buttons feel perfect although it has presented some disconnections when used with 2.4G wireless.
5,I moved to this mouse after a fewbyears if using the Black Mamba TE and I have to say even though I only use the 2 side button panel I love the hold feel and weight of this mouse. The subtle ring finger wrest really makes it feel like I have control of this nice ergonomic zen egg that I have no issue snapping to whatever target I have on my desktop. I do not see myself using any other mouse again.
1,I was really happy with this mouse for about 3 months - then it started having consistent performance issues.  Quick search and other product reviews mention an infamous "double click" issue and mine got it rather quickly.  Not only would I not suggest this as a gaming mouse I wouldn't even suggest it for an every day mouse.  I first noticed it playing mmorpg's where holding left click and right click moves you forward (World of Warcraft) but I can't even move an email from my inbox into a folder in Outlook.  It took me 10 tries to get it to take a Snip-it screen clip earlier today.  You will not be able to click anything consistently - this wouldn't even perform adequately playing minesweeper.Maybe others had better luck with Razer's customer service - I've got an email from 4/28 with Razer's Support saying they'll contact me but have yet to hear anything (It's 6/8 today as I write this).  Their email subject line says "We've got you covered and here's your case # ..." but what it really means is we've got your money and won't help - numerous reviews and posts online about this issue and they're still making it?  I use to be a big fan of razer products; keyboard mouse headset.  Got my first razer product back in the mid 2000s but they've lost a customer on this and I urge the rest of you to stay away from any current products.
5,Replaced my old original Naga with this one. Works great. If we're being honest the old one didn't need replaced... But this ones led is brighter/prettier. Our little secret lolI only use the mmo attachment so can't comment on the stupid ones.
4,The ring finger/pinky finger rests feel unnatural but the rest of it works well
1,I am an owner of the very first Razer mouse from back in the 90s. That thing was amazing. I have only used Razer control devices on my machines since then except for lately. In the past 3 years I have gone through 4 Razor Naga mice mainly because they all develop the exact same problem... double-click issues or no click issues with the left mouse button. This last one that I bought started failing after only 3 weeks.I will NEVER buy another item from Razer ever again. You have lost a long standing customer due to your pathetic quality constantly going downhill.
1,This mouse needs to be recharged every day.  My cheap red dragon could go a week before I needed to recharge it.  The plastic feels cheap.  The mouse just feels really cheap.  One of the worst purchases I made this year.  Save your money- Razer does not mean it's good because it really isn't.
3,The programs don't require you to log in every single day you restart the computer unlike it used to and i can be using it in guest mode which is good.  Very customizeable  with Other razer items.  the mouse is very basic without the razor program.  its stupid that the mouse goes back to default every time the program isnt running.  i dont need bloatware just to make my buttons working.  the onboard profiles arent working like they should and the program needs to be running anyways.
5,Honestly that mouse is great for gaming that i have ever had hands down so I'm back for round 2 and having my 1st gen molten core one for what seemed like 10 years. this one feel so much better and also changed for the better than that one did. I use this mouse for MMORTSMOBAXBLFPS. works like a charm.
1,Mouse 1 doesn’t stay depressed when you hold the button down. It is faulty and started acting up only weeks after purchase.
5,Awesome mouse overall. I use it for literally every game I play and you can even swap out the side plates mid game. A little pricey just because it’s a razer product but definitely worth it in my opinion
2,I've been using Razer Naga mice for years now.  A couple months back my previous Naga Trinity began having major issues with the right mouse button not "grabbing" when pressed and held specifically in World of Warcraft.  My other mouse (a Logitech mouse) did not have this issue.  I attempted a RMB repair myself with some success (the click response felt more like-new) but the problem remained.  Thinking it was a hardware issue I ordered a new mouse.Unfortunately it wasn't a hardware issue.  The problem with the right click "skipping" was still there and it was making the game unplayable.  As WoW is my MMO of choice right now it rendered this mouse functional unusable.  Unfortunately I'm passed my 30 day return window so I've now got a mouse that I'm hoping will one day work again with WoW if I can ever figure out what the disconnect is.TLDR: Good mouse but not for World of Warcraft (in my experience.)  Your mileage may vary.
1,I work my pc about 12+ hours a day. When my old Naga pro died after many years of problem free use I decided to buy a Naga Trinity since I didn't need a wireless mouse wanted to save $50 and thought Razer was a good company. For the first few months these mice work great and are comfortable to me but here is the problem. I've bought 5 of these Naga Trinity mice in the past 2 years because every single one has gotten the double click problem eventually. I think the longest one lasted about 7 months. I love the design and everything about this mouse accept their cheap mouse buttons. And if you think their customer service will help think again. They simply don't care and will just tell you either it's out of warranty or because it was purchased on Amazon "a 3rd party seller" who isn't an "approved seller" they won't honor their warranty... I really wish I could give them a better review but I'm tired of wasting money on junk that breaks after a few months. In conclusion this mouse is a Lemon and they should all be recalled and fixed properly.
4,Perfect for PC gaming. Fits your hand nicely no matter if your left or right handed. Last for years  This is our third one purchase.
2,I bought this mouse in Feb 2019 in Oct 2019 I had to RMA it for double clicking. It took over a month for me to get my replacement mouse. And now less than 3 months later the new one is doing the same double clicking.I googled. Apparently double clicking is a common issue with the Naga Trinity. Seriously save yourself the headache. It's a lovely mouse amazing even... when the thing isn't double clicking and ruining gaming. I even tried a script fix I found. Doesn't work at all. I'm going back to my Logitech G600.I had bought all Razer products because I wanted a "matching set" for my gaming setup. Razer firefly levathian sound bar Krazen headset Black Widow keyboard and the Naga Trinity mouse... I'm just going to sell all this off to someone else and go back to Logitech because my G600 has been working steady on my second computer for the last 6 years no problem.I am one very very dissatisfied customer. Once - I can forgive... twice? That's an issue with the product and should be solved before it's being sold.
5,Gran mouse
2,I've had the mouse for 5 months. I've put up with it for what I feel like is a very long time. This mouse has been giving me a problem when trying to click and hold since probably a month after purchase or so. I've been playing MMOs so I didn't mind it so much until I started to play a shooter. When I click and hold the mouse will register the first click let go for a second then the click and hold will finally continue to register.What this ends up doing to me in CoD for example is fire off 1 bullet out of my assault rifle then i continue to aim and fire nothing off for a second before my gun finally continues to fire off the rest of the rounds. Ya not fun staring at someone with your gun that won't shoot while they are blasting your face.I've never had many issues with razer products and have used their products for over a decade but this is where I find a different company. They've slipped from simple smooth functioning products to some fancy complicated broken products especially with the software that comes with these devices.
5,Producto llego antes de lo indicado.Tenia el razer naga trinity y  me di cuenta que los botones intercambiables del trinity le sirven tambien a este
3,Let me tell you why I've now dropped it down to 3. I still love this mouse but I'll be damned if Razer actually comes out with a mouse that lasts longer than a year. Every mouse I've ever bought from them has taken a crap after a year. My right mouse button on the Trinity has started to not work properly. I bought this mouse on April 5th 2019. It is now April 23 2020. Just over a year old and already crapping out. Come on now Razer.. We're spending top dollar for these products. I love your brand but good God this is frustrating.
3,I've bought three of these mice for one reason - the hexagonal 7 button layout. For playing games that have a large amount of spells mapped to your number keys there's just nothing better.The only problem is that this model of the mouse just refused to last longer than 6 months. And this sort of goes with all of my Razer brand mice but for this one in particular they just do not hold up and the net result is that I am mega bummed by it.
5,It's exactly what you'd expect it to be
5,This is the 3rd or 4th Naga I have experienced and maybe the 3rd generation? It still is the same quality as previous versions however now comes with attachments from previous models so rather you want the 6/7 button side or the 11 it has you covered. The Naga has been in production in various forms for what now? 8 years? It is one of the few mice Razer keeps producing and for good reason its extremely comfortable. I do not use it as I mouse left hand and its a right hand mouse however its continued praise is definately justified.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I find it really multifunctional for different games so for gaming I think it's good (of course depends on what kind of games you play and what kind of gamer you are). Good ergonomic design! RGB brightness is crazy good and nice feature about multiple profiles in mouse internal memory!
3,It’s awesome! When it’s not freaking out on you. It’s a shame because I’ve always used Razer products but this mouse will sometimes not react to your clicks on the number pad. I had to look up different ways people have delt with it and it took a combination of using different USB ports and changing some of the settings for it to work...with an occasional malfunction.
4,I have owned a Razor mouse for many years and when my first Naga died.... I had to replace it I was reluctant at first to consider this mouse with the 3 different designs but the price was good and well I gave it a shot.  I have been very happy with said mouse for over the last month.  and will continue to use it for all my gaming.
5,I love this mouse.  It is an addition to my other one. I swap them out when one dies.  I use this one for warcraft so I can switch between attacks.
3,The mouse is great at what it does which is provide easy access to buttons while gaming.  It takes some getting used to but after years of using these mouses I can't play games like WoW without one.  However something about the way the hand rests on the mouse and the angle that you're always pressing the buttons causes my hand to hurt after hours of gaming.  This is a problem that never seems to go away even after months of use.  So the ergonomics of the mouse are the crippling factor in my opinion.
1,I bought this back in September of 2021. Just a couple of months ago and now the scroll wheel doesn’t work correctly. It bounces around and won’t smoothly scroll.I contacted Razer and went through all their support troubleshooting to no avail. They said we’d have to RMA it and get a replacement. After giving them my info they say they can’t verify my “proof of purchase” which is literally a screenshot of my Amazon order with all the info in the world.So yeah my plan is currently to throw everything I own from Razer in the trash and move to Corsair. If this isn’t resolved I will never purchase another Razer product again. And I’m a long time customer. I buy a Naga every two years or so because that’s about how long they last if used regularly but I was fine with that. I’m not fine with it breaking within a couple of months nor am I fine with Razer support not assisting. It is already a pain that I would have gl use a spare mouse while I waited on their RMA program.
5,I use it mostly for gaming. I love it this is my third razer mouse. They are awesome. The side buttons make it easy to use your combat bars. Everything is right there.
1,I have no words of how much I dislike this mouse.  If you are a heavy gamer this mouse is definitely not for you. I initially bought a Razer Naga Trinity around October 2020 and by the time it was end of February 2021 the mouse was beaten up to the point I couldn't distinguish the key number's anymore. I initially thought I got a defective mouse with a poor paint job so I made the poor decision to repurchase the mouse due to loving the size of it. I was so used to playing my MMO on it that I didn't think of buying another brand (especially since I owned so much Razer I thought that this one time poor quality must've just been an outlier) but I regret that so much now. This mouse has done me poorly for a SECOND time. The second time I repurchased this mouse was March 2021 and its only April 2021 as I write this and the mouse's 7 key plate is already peeling again. Not to mention this mouse is having issues reading that a plate is on it sometimes and just turns off as you are trying to hit the keys. Its definitely made me re-evaluate the quality of Razer products.
3,The mouse feels good and the interchangeable plates are useful. Three main issues I had with the device though:1) The plates/side buttons sometimes don't work. Might be an issue with the magnets. Removing and reattaching the side buttons usually fixes it. It doesn't happen too often but enough to be annoying and could be a problem in the middle of game play.2) The scroll wheel's side click functionality is way to easy to trigger. I'm constantly browsing forward or backwards when scrolling in a web browser among other things.3) I feel mouse buttons are too easy too press. I've had many accidental clicks just lightly resting my fingers on the buttons. I expected a better "click" actuation from a gaming mouse.
3,If you're running an older Windows 7 machine this mouse will not be compatible with the Synapse 3 software. So no RGB support no macros etc. Also you'll have to use the drivers that Windows automatically installs if you want it to work at all. Ergonomics could also be improved. I have small hands but buttons are near impossible to press without straining your thumb. Not super impressed but I did get it on sale for $60 here on Amazon. Honestly I'd say that's really all it's worth.
4,Works great the seamless transition from the different covers. I like to play a wide range of games FPS RTS and MOBA's and it does what I need it to do very well. My main complaint is that the RGB lighting could be better and they could have put some higher quality buttons on the side.I got mine on sale so for the price it was worth it to me but I can definitely say that buying this MSRP would not be worth it.
5,So far this mouse has been great and has many functions. Easy to program and change profiles that way you can easily swap profiles based on the game you are playing. Only issue is if you have your bios setup to boot from usb and did not change to boot from hard drive after installing a new ssd the computer mistakes the mouse as a bootable device and gets hung up trying to boot until you disconnect it. Easy fix just a learning experience on how new technology works.
5,Holy fish moley what a mouse! If you game and play any MMOs or games with multiple buttons to press you need this. Very easy to install Windows 10 saw it immediately and asked if I wanted to install the control software. The software is very easy to use change lights to ANY color and program all the buttons with ease. Changeable sides are Heald on with magnets the ones you find in old hard drives you know the ones that pinch fingers cause they are so strong! Yup those ones so the side stays on even when you are mashing all 12 thumb buttons.
5,Son loves it for gaming.  Has 3 different sets of button attachments that are all programmable for different functions
1,I really liked this mouse and I don't play games too often so it took me a bit to get around to using it. It has an issue that many of the other buyers seem to have. I thought that because it was highly rated it would be fine but I too have an issue with the right click. It will randomly stop holding right click then go back to right click. For a while I thought it was an issue with my game but after testing different mice I can say for sure the mouse is the issue. I don't think these mouse are made to last. For the price I was hoping to get one that last but if its not durable then I don't see a reason not to get a cheaper mouse that will last about the same amount of time. Issue was I didn't have the issue right when I got it perhaps I just didn't notice it but other reviews said that eventually the right click would give them problems. My guess is its a big issue for the mouse but not everyone notices it.
2,I usually use this mouse in the 7-key mode which is great for mapping many game functions to the mouse.  The RGB is great as well.  The issue as many have pointed out Synapse 3 is garbage freezes or crashes often updates wipe out stored settings/profiles RGB stops using profile settings after unlocking the lock screen etc.  Not to mention it requires you to create a Razer account just to use the software.With that being said I actually loved this mouse until the dreaded left-click double-clicking issue cropped up.  Nearly all of my single-clicks are now functioning as double-clicks.  This mouse still looks brand new too; I take care of my stuff.  I used to have this issue with Steel Series mice but the last 2 Razer mice I owned have done this now too (this Razer Naga Trinity and my Razer Death Adder Elite).I'm done with Razer products now; switching everything over to Logitech.
5,I own the Razor Naga 2014 Naga Chroma Naga Hex V2 Then tracking issues and lift off jumps ended my using them. The Razor Naga Trinity is the mouse I have been waiting for. The new 5G Optical Sensor makes this mouse the best and most comfortable mouse I have. Which I have wasted a lot of money trying to find my perfect mouse. I own the G502 G703 lightspeed great mouse not enough buttons Steal series 500  ROCCAT Nyth Needs better sensor  MIONIX NAOS 7000 and a few more. So when Razor finally put the top notch Optical Sensor on a mouse whos button layouts I'm already familiar with my search for my perfect mouse has ended.
1,Replaced another Razer mouse that the left mouse button died after only 2 years of light use. This one made it a whole two weeks before it randomly disconnected and will only work in 5 second bursts after unplugging and plugging back in. Support site says it’s not covered. Spectacular waste of money. Done with Razer.
4,Very good mouse but the button placement is a little off for the shape of my hand.  I realize that this will vary person to person though.Dpi and control and response is amazing and it's a good quality mouse
1,Came damaged and the switchable pads didn't connect well and would often not do anything when pressed. Returned it soon after.
5,Went from crappy red dragon mouse to this.  Its a death adder indeed.
1,Left scroll wheel button started to malfunction about 3 months in and was useless after 5 months. The only reason it lasted that long is because I opened it up and found out the button wasn’t putting enough pressure on the sensor so I added padding…definitely not a permanent solution. The number keys would also not register unless you turned it off for a few seconds which is less than desirable in the middle of pvp. For the price I expected much more. I guess Razer’s quality really has gone to hell. Sacrificed wireless but got a Logitech G600 for over half the price.
1,Bought a pair of these 2 months ago. 1 for me 1 for the wife. We exclusively play World of Warcraft together. After a month mine has become impossible to use in wow (play by holding right click and move mouse to look around). As well as making it absolutely miserable to work in excel or move files around without random crap happening.No amount of light or heavy pressure on the right mouse button will keep it "held" at all times. it's getting worse over time.I don't typically write reviews but I emailed Razer over 4 days ago (Case #: 200502-002110) and still haven't even heard a peep back. I've never returned anything on amazon before so I'm going to try that route after this review. $75 mouse with a "2 year warranty" and cant even get a reply from the company after it fails 2 months in.Please do yourself a favor and google the naga trinity mouse. It has a substantial failure rate for the micro switches the clicking activates.*update*... 3 months and 14 days after the original purchase of 2 getting 1 replaced at 2 months. Now the left click on both are bugged. randomly clicking.Do yourself a favor and stay FAR FAR FAR away from this overpriced piece of junk. Oh yeh razer also never responded to the support ticket. Amazon was kind enough to replace the first one. while it was within the 2 month window.
1,Not the razed Nagata. Does not have the same functionality when you plug it in it will say razor viper mini.
2,Update:Optical sensor stopped working just after 6months of use. No at-home fixed resolved the issue and since I purchased this product through Amazon the exchange with manufacturer is very difficult. I ended up buying a Corsair mouse in-store at Micro Center-- better long term customer support with much less hassle.Still one of the better gaming mice for MMO players. Affordable with adjustable cursor speeds and a slaving on the side buttons that are comfortable for most hand sizes. I miss the higher quality version of the Naga and wish they still made it. This one doesn't have LED lights that change colors and the materials feel lighter and less substantial than the previous model. But it feels and functions the same. One of the better ergonomic mice available.
3,We use this mouse for non gaming use and needed to program several of the buttons to do various macro's. It is not the easiest thing to program. The buttons do not feel as high as quality as many of the Logitech mice we've used and cleaning them everyday with sanitizer makes them only last about a month but there is no way around that since different users float to this computer and have to use the mouse.
3,Great for gaming MMO's really helps when using large amounts of bindable skills. Only complaint since ive owned 3 of these mouses over the years and all of them get the same issue the scroll wheel slowly stops working/flicking around. As a avid gamer 4-8 hours a day all the nagas ive owned get lots of action but they always have one flaw the scrool wheel on them acts up. This one 2 months after purchase startedvto randomly scroll up and down fidgeting occasinally if I scroll in one static direction just as my past nagas have. I have not stopped using it though as the scroll wheel hasnt completelt stopped working yet as it has on my past nagas so maybe this one is blessed.
3,I have had this for almost a year and the warm lights on my side buttons have stopped working. Cool colors still work. The rest of the mouse still functions well. (I game frequently so it does get heavy use and I clean my equipment.) The many buttons are essential when gaming and the many options for the mouse are great. I just wish it lasted longer.In the past I have bought multiple Razer mouses and they have always been expensive and never last very long. However everything about them is great otherwise.
3,This is a great mouse and I've used many naga's over the years for mmo play. However after about 2 years it starts the same miss click problem. For its price with 1-2 year life span its not recommend...
3,like all razer products its built cheap and designed to fail. dont buy a razer product without the extended warrany because they will squirm out of any responsibility when their product inevitably fails before its half life.that said it feels nice in my hand. all the buttons in a comfortable place. its a shame they dont design them to last.
2,Worked for a few months then just died no lights no charging won't turn on nothing just dead plastic expensive plastic at that. Customer support was of no help wanting me to take picture and video of the problem and do and send them back a email. How am I supposed to video the device not turning on exactly and then how am I supposed to send that's via email when the shortest video I can take is still to large to send? Just wrote it off as a loss and went back to my 2 year old Logitech mouse that still works fine but not a many buttons. Think im done buying razor products the previous mouse in had by them also broke.
5,The mouse is awesome works perfectly the panels are switched easily. 16K DPI is amazing you can change it on the go. This model can store up to 5 profiles with different settings and button bindings inside its built-in RAM and you can switch them without any software with a special switch on the bottom. The switch has a LED indicator with different colors so you can identify the current profile (you can manage this in a Razer Synaps software and store it in mouse’s memory.) This is my third Naga the previous ones are still working (the very first one is 8 y.o.) - that’s some quality for you :)
3,It is a heavy mouse but not necessarily a big mouse. I have small/medium sized hands so the size isn’t an issue but the weight is. I do not recommend this mouse to anyone that sweats a lot from their hands. aside from all that it feels nice but it’s build quality is meh at best. From the couple of months I used it I feel like it would not make it to the 1 year mark without it going bad.
5,I needed a newer mouse than the one I got for $5 at a flea market and since I love online games I wanted to get something that would be good for gamers.I read a lot of reviews on which mouse was the best for RPG and FPS games and went with the Razer Naga Trinity. I like how the mouse buttons are interchangeable and can change it with 3 different parts. It works great with World of Warcraft and tons of other Steam games.I like how the color changing is customizeable and can select what the colors to do.
3,It all starts good then when you click so much they give out. it only took me a few months till this bad boy gave up. now i cant cant unless i mash hard or it double clicks for me making it seem im pressing the button twice but not. I say the extra macro keys are good but when swapping feature be aware they cant read sometimes. Wosrt is when u havent swapped nothing out but the macros dont work so you gotta play the N64 blow and lick me game. Good luck to ya'll buying this.
2,In general our office has great experiences with Razer products - keyboards mice headphones and accessories throughout the last 5 years.  The different Naga Trinity mice that we have ordered have all failed to the point of uselessness within 6-9 months of purchase but did have great performance up until then.  Everyone in the office is a normal computer user for technical work with an occasional break a couple of times a week to "heavily use" the mouse in first person shooter games.  Each Naga Trinity's main left and right mouse buttons began to fail slightly by not registering initial clicks within 4-6 months.  Then they began to quickly degenerate into a "stutter" and either fail to register a click entirely or emit incorrect double- or triple-clicks when users were very solidly holding down either left or right button.  With this many data points on the Naga Trinity mouse hardware failure had to write this review to warn customers against this mouse but just as a redirect to other Razer products that have held up over time far better.
5,Pensé que me quedaría con el layout de 12 botones (solia tener un naga estandar) pero es muy util poder cambiar entre los diferentes layouts dependiendo del juego (Moba MMO FPS).Hasta ahora todo perfectom y funciona muy bien con synapse.
3,I love the feel of the mouse I love the look. The only thing is eventually on every naga the left or right click will break and not hold or just not click altogether. I have had over 5 nagas and its happened to every single one of them but I need the side buttons and don't like the feel of other mouses on the market with side buttons.TLDR: Great mouse but have a backup when your 1st one eventually breaks and you are waiting on warranty.
2,I can't recommend these anymore...They break the buttons randomly stop working everybody has the double click issue and probably worst of all if you CTRL+ALT+Delete and look at your running processes Razor has like 6-10 things running all of the time. It's bloat wear.Bad hardware Bad software.They used to have a good product but it appears the corporate agenda took over and now everything is cheaper.My first Razor nagas lasted 3 years. Now I've gone through 2 more in 3 months. In 3 months they are bad. And good luck trying to return them they make you go through hell for warranty returns.Nope... I will never buy razor products again.
5,Muy buen producto llego rápido funciona excelente no presenta ningún fallo ni en hardware ni softwareRecomendado
2,Swapping out the side buttons is annoying and after only a couple months I just stuck with the forward/back buttons accessory because it covered 80% of my needs. I bought it because I like having a numpad under my thumb for gaming but there's no reason the mouse couldn't have been designed with that and the forward/back buttons as part of the mouse in a single piece. Now I just have extra bits of useless plastic cluttering my desk.After almost a year the left mouse button has started sending double-clicks presumably because the switch is failing and is not debounced properly on the circuit board.Enough with the flashy LEDs. Just give me a mouse with quality switches and debounce circuits.
5,Came with all the pieces and so far after 3 months I haven't had any issues with it. Works perfectly and the software allows for macros if you want some of those on it with the 12 button side.
1,I used this mouse for many types of FPS games. After about 2 or 3 months I started to notice that sometimes the RGB wouldn't turn on and then all of a sudden it would randomly work again within a couple of hours of turning off. However From there it got far worse within about 3-4 months of my purchase I noticed that the 3x4 side panel had completely lost function. I was then forced to use the 2 button panel because the 7 panel personally has the weirdest and most uncomfortable button design that I've ever seen. From there the mouse started to misclick doing things like not clicking or stopping randomly when I would hold it down. This makes it virtually useless to play games. Not to mention when video editing the double click was the most frustrating thing ever. I couldn't even move tabs in google chrome without having to try multiple times. I love razer and personally they are one of my favorite gaming brands. However They have seemed to start cheaping out on build quality. For example things like the Huntsman mini feel cheap and the ear covers for the Kraken start to tear and flake off. I hope razer starts to put more work into their ever-expanding expensive products. I do not recommend this mouse.
4,Decent mouse for MMOs and ARPGs. Not really great for shooters since optical accuracy is better than laser. Razer software sucks unless you really enjoy updating every 3 hours -1 star. Typical of just about anything "gaming" great hardware supported by bad software. I could rant for hours about synapse but there are plenty of YouTube videos that can do that for me.
2,This is a nice MMO gaming mouse. It works on the Mac OS in the sense that keys 1 thru 12 is available to you on the mouse. However it is important that Mac users know the following:(1) Razer's Synapse software for Mac DOES NOT WORK on the Mac OS. So you cannot customize the mouse(2) Razer's Synapse software for Mac interferes with the Mac OS and can cause your Mac to crash. Also once you install it you will have a hard time removing the software. The "RazerHid.kext" file will stay in your extensions folder no matter what you do. To remove it you have to completely wipe your Mac hard-drive and reinstall the Mac OS.While this is a good mouse for gaming the software leaves one feeling as if something nefarious is afoot.Do buy the mouse; just don't download the software if you are a Mac user.
2,The mouse is a neat idea. Essentially three mice in one for a pretty decent price point. The issue is that the shape of the mouse is just terrible. It doesn't fit any style of grip nicely and the interchangeable buttons are so poorly placed that it's near impossible for anyone with larger hands to lift the mouse up off of the mat without accidentally hitting every button. The ring finger rest makes the mouse much larger and more uncomfortable than it would be without it and it leaves nowhere for your pinky to go as a result. Finally the entire mouse seems to slant downwards from the left click to the right click at a much steeper angle than any other mouse I've seen before resulting in the grip being even more uncomfortable for anything other than palm.The mouse itself tracks very smoothly and the side buttons are extremely easy to change due to them being held in place with magnets. Just like every Razer product the software that you download with the mouse is absolutely buggy and crashes more often than not.
1,Requires razer synapse 3 which by itself is fine. However I also have a chroma naga that I wanted to migrate profiles from synapse 2 for.  This is not an option even though they previously said it would be.  In addition with Synapse 3 installed it took control of the chroma naga and since synapse 2 profiles "aren't compatible"  it reset my chroma back to defaults as well (all profiles are gone).  So now the new mouse needs set up from scratch AND I can't  use the old mouse in the mean time.  The solution is to uninstall Synapse 3 re-Install synapse 2 manually write down all the settings from all my profiles re-install synapse 3 and manually add all the profiles again.  This will likely take hours and basically has to be done for this to be usable. This is a very basic feature and is something that should be included. I expected more at this price point.To be clear "aren't compatible" means they were too lazy to write the  software.  The old mouse is the same it operates the same way it did 5 minutes ago when it had access to all my profiles.  Only their software has changed.TL;DR Great hardware horrible software.  If I could do it over I would choose a more reasonably priced competitors mouse.
2,The Razer Naga is an awesome mouse one of my favorites since it came out... while it works.Razer has a problem a continuing problem. The lifespan of their mice is very low. This product is not an exception. I haven't had the mouse a year yet and the left mouse button will mis-click or release a held click at random. This especially noticeable in any application that requires drag and drop.I purchased this mouse to replace the previous version of this mouse which had a similar issue with it's scroll wheel. While scrolling up it would frequently scroll down for a tick or two making anything from gaming to reading a spreadsheet a chore. The mouse from them I had before that had the same scroll wheel issue.Next mouse I buy is going to be a logitech... I am tired of this nonsense and I feel like I have given Razer plenty of time (several generations of products) to fix their issues.
1,I've purchased this mouse twice. The first one stopped working properly after a year and a half. The laser would no longer register movement properly and would either dart all over the screen move at a snail's pace or not move at all. The replacement I purchased was faulty right out of the box. Every time I click M1 the pointer drifts upwards. Would not recommend this product.
5,Es un mouse suave al tacto los boton al costado son faciles de precionar suaves pero no lo suficiente para presionar sin quera buena calidad de materialez y customizacion lo malo que no se puede regular el peso del mouse para algunos les puede parecer pesado a mi me gusta asi.
1,Bought this mouse so I could play Final Fantasy 14. Stopped working after about 2 weeks. Looked for solutions online and even checked Razer forums and nothing worked. Waste of my money.
1,a little note: Im very gentle with my mice ive only ever had one break and thats because it died out of wear and tear(this is context you will need so you dont think i was to intense with this mouse). I used this mouse for about three months It worked flawlessly not a single game had issues all the buttons and plates worked as advertised the metal body was very sturdy and felt nice and heavy a really good multi purpose mouse for a really good price (i got it for 70$). However the reason why this mouse has garbage design is because inside the mouse there is no protection for the motherboard against the mouse wheel and i press in the middle mouse wheels to reload in games well today i was playing destiny 2 and went to reload when all of a sudden my mouse stops responding not a single button worked and the mouse wheel got very stiff. So me being the little electronic nerd that i am decided to open up my mouse to see what happend and well it turned out to be that when i pressed down on the middle mouse wheel the motherboard  snapped which caused the mouse to obviously fail and get the mouse wheel caught all because of the mouse wheel being pressed down. I now see why no one has heard of this mouse it's design is so flawed and repairable that razor's keeping quiet and will not want to show off because this product will hurt there reputation of being the one of the best computer accessory manufacturers.
5,I've bought this mouse twice. The first one developed a double click issue after intense use for a year which I eventually repaired and gave to a friend.Reliable comfortable fully customisable and pretty.
3,Had my 'mmo 12' razer mouse die after ~10 years of use. This is the modern version. It's a good mouse but not nearly as good as the old models. They need to get their quality back up to standards. I get double clicks inputs on single click and dropped clicks on 'click and drag' operations quite a bit.
2,This mouse is such a let-down.  I chose it because of the 2 aspects I needed wireless and MMO side buttons.Firstly the MMO side buttons are very sensitive and the mouse is heavy enough with them that you push buttons when you lift it to recenter.  Secondly the wireless capability is excellent when it works but 90% of the time it has serious connectivity issues so you have to plug it in to actually use it anyway.The positives to me would outweigh the negatives if only the wireless actually worked.  The other 2 side button plates are great and it is a really nice mouse.  Too bad for being so versatile it only works well in 1 setup..wired with basic side buttons.
5,This has changed the way I game in the best way possible no more awkward key binds everything is right at my finger tips.
3,So not 60 days after receiving my naga trinity did the double click / misclick issue begin.  I was so thrilled to finally have a mmo mouse again and have avg 2hrs a day on casual play dor only past month. Having been a previous Razer branded product fan I am considering the quality has faded. I will update on status after hearing back from seller in terms of warranty and defect issue.
1,I was a huge fan of the Razer Naga that I bought in 2014.  I used it for 5 years and over ten of thousand hours.  Recently the right mouse click started to fail and so I ordered this mouse to replace it.  The mouse arrived in good condition and so I plugged it into my computer and boxed up my old mouse.The new mouse requires that you use Razer Synapse3 in order to be anything other than a standard mouse.  Razer Synapse3 is the most poorly designed garbage software that I have ever had the misfortune of using.  You cannot use the old Synapse 2.0 with this mouse.  Profiles of macros and button bindings are not portable from the company's old software Synapse 2.0 so if you used an older product you're out of luck.  New profiles cannot be linked to programs to use without first waiting for Synapse to search your computer for possible options letting it search again because you haven't wasted enough time and finally being able to go and select the correct program from a file browser which you should have been able to to from the start.  Even then it will sometimes refuse to link to a program that you have pointed it to because... reasons.Add to all of this that the software looks bad takes up much more space both visually and on your harddisk and is significantly less useful than the old Razer Synapse 2.0 and it severely damages the usefulness of the mouse.I would not recommend any Razer product that uses Synapse3 to any person ever.
5,Fun story my desk from Walmart broke this mouse was on the slider for the desk.  So the mouse was dropped for all intents and purposes  speaking to its durability.  It works great clicks feel solid response is smooth.  And you can scroll up and down pages with a tilt of the center mouse wheel.  How cool is that?!? Right i know.  Scrolling really isnt hard but they made it easier.  Oh and I use the 12 button mouse attachment.  Super good mapping to keep the edge in your gaming.
3,Not a bad gaming mouse but despite the advertising Razer Synapse (the companion software required to set keybinds and color profiles) will NOT run on Mac OS Big Sur and is not support for any Mac OS past 10.14. Do NOT buy this if you plan to use it on a Mac. If you're on a PC go for it.
5,Quick and easy to change button attachments A little heavier than the regular Naga but that's to be expected plus I got used to it immediately. Great mouse great packaging.
5,At first I dislike the idea of the buttons on the mouse but when I saw that you can change that part I like it Im using the buttons like if that was the first thing that i like about this mouse. Is confortable for my hand and have great support from the branf it self.
4,The mouse work but when i switch profiles the light not change for the lights of another profile.
2,When the mouse actually works its fine. Unfortunately this mouse has been complete garbage for me since I got it.  I've never had this many issues with a mouse before. From the computer failing to detect it (tried on multiple computers) to the mouse just acting up in general. I cannot recommend this mouse with good faith. There are far cheaper mouses out there that work a ton better.Theres also the chance that maybe I just got a defective mouse. I tried to reaching out to support though (through the razer website not amazon) and they were not helpful. They just kept suggesting to uninstall and reinstall the software which did nothing.
5,I haven't had the issues I've seen others have with buttons and quality.  It's holding up well for a couple months so far.I haven't used the hex or two button sides at all since I only use the 12 botton one for FFXIV.I also didn't bother installing the Razer drivers/controller since I only bind it to the regular numbers (the default)Works great out of the box on my win10 system.
2,I've had my Naga Trinity for about 2 years now and it worked great at first but after about a year I started noticing the left mouse button wouldn't register me holding down or clicking sometimes. It was infrequent but manageable but now I basically have to slam the thing for it to register. If you play first person shooters or any kind of game that will require you to consistently shoot or use your mouse then I wouldn't recommend this one. The ability to have your num pad on your thumb is awesome and the only reason I'm giving two stars but other than that this mouse will probably only be good for a few months before you start noticing problems.
5,I bought this for my Husband as he is just now getting into MMORPGs with me. He loves how comfortable it is and easy to use especially the 12 buttons on the side to help him with his gaming rotation. 10/10 recommend for anyone who is an expert at MMOs or just beginning. A great mouse for a great price.
1,Apparently my previous review was never submitted and I'm not one to normally give one star reviews. But this was the single most worst mouse I have ever used. The materials were cheap with the surface chipping where my fingers were at after moderate use over the course of a few months and the interchangeable side would often loosely connect. Even after modding to get the contacts to connect properly it would work often rapidly disconnect and reconnect to where it would freeze my computer until it was disconnected.It eventually completely failed to properly track and stay connected to the computer so now the mouse sits in a cup it around 36-42 pieces.I will not ever buy another mouse by Razer again the incredibly poor quality you get out of such an expensive mouse was hands down the worst purchase I have invested in. This is coming from a little less than two years of owning the mouse for moderate gaming class and remote work.
1,My biggest complaint about this product is the software that you have to use if you're going to adjust the dpi. When it's not completely non-responsive it's unbelievably slow. When you save a profile for your games it'll probably be wiped out by the next update. The software will just randomly change the dpi from my setting 750 dpi to some ungodly max setting which is like 12000 or something crazy and then you'll have no control over your in game movement. At 12000 dpi any little twitch will be completely disorienting and you'll have to back out of your game and then try to open synapse. Sometimes it opens eventually sometimes it doesn't do a thing. I've had this mouse for a little over a year now and I've had several Razer products before and have always been happy with their performance but this will be the last Razer product I ever buy. The experience of owning this piece of junk has been nothing but total frustration.Want to fire up your nice gaming pc with ssd and a boot time of maybe 30 seconds and be in game within 90 seconds... too bad your going to have to wait for the slowest software ever to load then you're going to have to log into that piece of crap code just to load your profile (unless it's been erased then you get to enjoy the hell that is setting up your mouse all over again) It's a freaking mouse.... it should not need to be this friggin complicated!Run away from anything with a Razer tag on it!!
5,This is absolutely the best gaming mouse I've used so far. Its comfortable on my hand and works perfect on my PC and PS4. I even installed the Razer Synapse and it makes gaming and using the mouse 100 times better and easier.
5,Easy to use out of the package no complicated set up just plug in and it worked
5,This is my second mouse from Naga I had the razer before the trinity and I really like this brand! They hold up very well good value for the money! Easy to use and great for gaming. I really don't change the sides I like the one with the buttons!
5,Pretty slappin mouse love the extra keys and synapse program. Being able to macro each key is awesome. Probably the most important part of being good at PC games.
4,Well the bottoms on the side don’t always seem to respond. Playing FFXIV and OW online and several times already I hit the buttons on the side (12 button set up) and nothing will happen. Older model works better.
5,Gas
1,Stopped working 15 minutes in to using it. Returned and got my refund used my money for a Corsair Scimitar. Best decision I’ve made regarding a new mouse.
1,Bought this mouse for my boyfriend for his birthday was very pleased with my purchase since Razer products have been our go to for our gaming adventures. Was very unhappy and shockingly disappointed when it only lasted my boyfriend 2 months before the buttons gave way and stopped functioning properly. We thought well Razer has never stood us wrong in the past maybe this one was just a faulty one we happen to stumble upon So we bought another Shortly after him playing around the same amount of time goes by and he starts having issues with his mouse as well WTF!?! It's not as though these are cheap and not as though Razer is...or as I thought a brand that plays around with their products. I can not believe this has happened yet again with the same kind of mouse this one... We both even read the reviews and hardly anyone had anything bad to say about the mouse It's either really bad luck that this just happened twice within a 4 month period or they are now dishing out shitty products. Only thing I know is now we're on the hunt again but for a different brand. Thanks for the waste of money I totally could of used it on a bill js.
4,My only complaint is that the wire is t removable like my original naga epic but I mostly used it wired so it’s not a big deal. Great software that allows for customization is appreciated.
5,Definitely worth a try the easy swap button panels are great. Would like to have a little more texturing to avoid hand slips but that's just me.
1,I'm going on my third mouse in six months.  For the first mouse the left button had switch problems and would drop and re-gain clicks randomly after owning it for two months.  For the second mouse the right mouse button starting dropping clicks and the side number buttons became unreliable.  Razer has serious quality control problems with their hardware.  I'm rolling the dice on a third though I'd rather just have my money back pro-rated even so I can buy a better mouse from a better company that actually cares about customers and quality products.Razer customer service was condescending and ignored multiple questions about the quality of their products and a guarantee for receiving a mouse that would not exhibit this problem again.  They chose the slowest possible shipping speed so I was without my mouse for weeks waiting for them to receive my mouse re-test it and ship a replacement.Synapse will occasionally not load the correct profile at PC startup so my pointer speed and acceleration settings and lighting settings wouldn't work.Stay far away from Razer.  They got too comfortable with higher revenue growth and decided to burn everything around them in pursuit of more.
5,Was meant to replace my Naga Epic but the keys on the hex and the double button just feel cheap and they're so easily pressed. There's reviews that say the same thing the 12 button pad is nice; but I get that on the Naga Epic standard no reason to upgrade. Reason for high review is it does the job it's just not for me and it's very pretty. Love that it can be used with the Synapse 3.0 and you can do the custom colors to match the Ornata keyboard I use; unlike the Naga Epic.
4,Just using the two button config the M5 came up to my thumb knuckle. I would like if if I didn't rely on those keys for gaming. I ended up rebuying a mouse brand that had broke. Also unweighted. Too light on a friction free surface.
5,The mouse is perfect for switching between different games that require different amounts of buttons. If you haven’t used a razer mouse before the geometry can take a minute to get used to but is very comfortable once you use it enough. Only complaint is that the 2 button panel doesn’t have any rgb. Razer chroma software is very user friendly and gives u variety of patterns to chose from. Especially when using multiple razer devices. 10/10 would buy again.
1,I have owned this mouse for less than 6 months i believe at this point. Already the left mouse button is double-clicking every 2nd or 3rd time it is used. It is an annoyance and will do this randomly. If you are trying to drag a window it can do it and maximize the window. If you want ton highlight something it will do it and cause another issue. If you are trying to single click it can do it and cause issues.I'm disappointed in a mouse doing this when less than 6 months old. Probably the last Razer product i purchase as I took another chance on a Razer mouse even after another issue years ago when a Razer Mouse just quit working 10 months after purchase. I stopped purchasing Razer products completely at that point then finally gave them another chance. Fail on their part for product quality and fail on my part for reversing my original decision to avoid their products. I've never had this issue from a 6 month old Logitech nor any other brand of mouse i tend to purchase. Of course in may Amazon's support for my issues was ended so i'm kind of stuck at this point i'm believing. Lesson learned Razer AVOID your products. Also for those thinking this is an isolated incident a simple search will reveal many with the same issue for this mouse and a history of the same issue dating a long time back regarding Razer mouse unintended double-clicking.My personal opinion: Avoid Razer and if not Razer in general CERTAINLY this mouse.En joy your day...
1,Reading the other reviews shows this is not an outlier problem. Single-clicks very often show as double-clicks and dragging things around the screen fails more often than not. It appears that the manufacturer is using cheap switches for the mouse buttons and this is not something I expect from something advertised as a gaming mouse.I don't use this mouse for gaming it's in my home office on my work laptop and it does not get anything close to what you would expect to see from gaming use.For what it's worth I have double- and triple-checked my mouse settings to ensure that my double-click speed is not so slow that two clicks in a second would register as a double-click. Testing the functionality in the mouse settings shows that even at the fastest double-click speed setting a single-click registers as a double around 40 to 50% of the time.Shame on you Razer!
5,I can only give my opinion based on what a child is telling me  i would not pay this much for a mouse myself but he loved the fact that he can interchange the controls and use the buttons he needs for playing.
5,This thing GLIDES! I love it! I also like the circular side pad the best! The numerical one is a bit complicated for me and the standard 2 is fine. The glow can be altered to any color with synapse and now my PC is all green and purple!
1,Prior to owning a MMO mouse I had the Razer Deathadder which lasted me a good 3-4 years at least so I had faith in Razer mice. But I definitely can't say the same for this mouse. The first one I purchased I got the protection plan and got some money back for it so at the time I thought it was just a fluke. So I bought another one cause again I had faith in their mice & keyboards. Well as you can tell from the headline I probably won't be buying any Razer mice especially since the trinity is the only MMO mouse they offer which keeps ending up with the same problem. I feel like their quality is starting to take a dive on headsets and mice if I'm being honest.Other than the 6 month life span it's a bit bulky but I got used to it and it was nice. I mean it did it's job as an MMO mouse. But I rarely swapped out the sides due to reading other reviews saying that the pins would end up getting loose and not connecting properly. Didn't have that issue but that's cause I never swapped out the sides and now I'm just used to the MMO mouse layout so gotta find a different mouse brand especially since that's the only MMO mouse they have.
1,I fell in love with the Naga mouse years ago perfect for MMOs or even FPS. But this generation is just bad. The middle mouse button just stopped working and I have only had this for maybe 3 months. I don't even game as much as I used to so that makes it even worse. I can hear the button clicking but it does nothing not even work intermittently. My friend has a Naga as well and surprise surprise same thing happened. Middle mouse button stopped working. I am sure it's a known problem.I am going to contact Razer to try for a warranty but I know they won't honor it. Last few times I contacted Razer for warranty on their products they say "normal wear and tear" or come up with some other reason to not honor the warranty.Side note I honestly don't know why I keep going back to Razer products their quality has gone downhill over these last few years. Perhaps it's my own fault for expecting them to improve.
1,mouse was fine and worked fine for about 3 months after that its gone down hill since. the 6 side button panel 2 doesnt work even after trouble shooting and i had to use the old 6 panel one which the 3 button would give me trouble by not working randomly. if your thinking about buying this mouse don't the old and  new one have given me no stop trouble along with other razor products.
5,I absolutely love this mouse it's quick comfortable (especially with the nerve damage in my hand) and insanely useful with the changeable plates.  I'll never go back after owning this beast.
1,Do not buy this mouse unless you like the default lighting of cycling throw all the colors. After a few months I upgraded from the old razer Synapse 2 (the program you need to use to control the RGB lighting) to Synapse 3 because I realized it came out and I still had 2 from my previous razer peoducts. Now every other update the mouse experiences a random glitch where it will just constantly pull in a certain direction until I restart my computer. One update will fix it one update will cause it to pull down next will fix it again next will cause it to pull to the right and so on.The most frustrating part is that it will work until the moment it just doesn't. This can be minutes hours or days after a restart and the start seems to be entirely random. I tried talking to support and they first requested video of it happening (which was fairly hard to get when you can't accurately click on anything). Then they told me to try updating the software and cleaning the sensor both of which did nothing. Then they just dropped the case and never got back to me again.
5,I love this seller. Despite being pre owned not even any single scratch or any kind of mark of use. I bought another one for my friend from the same seller as soon as first one arrived. (name of seller was something like 1001 deals on electonics)
5,
5,it’s a good mouse not too small not nor large. perfect for an adult male hand the response is smooth and great for FPS games.
3,I love it. It's my favorite mouse.But I bought it in December 2019 and it's August 2020 and it's dead. the right and left buttons aren't catching 50-70% of the time. I would have thought the interchange side plate would be the issue but the 7 button side plate makes this the best MMO mouse on the market. Unfortunately the right and left clicker didnt last at all.
5,I am very satisfied with this mouse even though I just use one of the attachments. I am more happy with the software capabilities like HyperSwitch 10/10
5,Works like a charm now this is my third one I think so my  only negative is they don’t last that long for the price but other than that I’m very happy
5,I game - a lot. This is the second Trinity I have had - only because my wife took my first one. The keys on the side are perfect for gaming and binding and I've even been able to bind normal pc functions to the keys. After my wife took my other one I had to resort to an old two button mouse until this order came in. Don't know how to operate without it!
5,It has outlasted the Logitech G2 that I bought twice before. The Logitech mouse had double-clicking issues. No problems with this mouse so far.
1,I've been a Razer consumer for a long time.  They really missed the boat here.  Quite possibly their worst rendition of the Naga.  Two main issues that really make it a product you MUST AVOID.  They removed the "home row" lip on the 5 button which allowed quick resetting to the center.  Without this your thumb just slides around without guidance.  That could be viewed as a bad choice.  The most egregious change is they made the wireless Pro have a different slot for charging.  What do I mean by this?  They have a traditional android charging input; however they put ridges on the slot so that only the ridged charging cable that comes with the mouse will fit it.  NONE of the other Razer charging cables or any normal android charging cable that fits the input will work because of the ridges.  This adds zero utility and reduces its functionality.  This is greed personified.  So disappointed with whoever was in charge of this rendition.  I can only hope they are summarily fired because they are not good for the brand or Razer image.
3,This is driving me crazy i normally charge the mouse at night time and my pc is in my room.  The mouse will flash and then turn green and its really bright.  No way to turn this off i tried  everything. Fyi only a problem when using the wireless charger. They really need and option to turn the LEDs off.
2,I really want to love these mice I really do but man they all end up having the same issues. I have gone through 3 of these in the last 5 years. the old school naga pro last me 3 years and it was great then I got a wired/wireless one last year and it worked ok but was by far the worst model I have owned. . and then finally this model... which lasted a solid 4 months.. I have to take the plate of constantly to stop buttons from getting stuck.  I am giving 2 stars because there at least is an easy and quick fix but you basically have to do it all the time now. It's sad because this mouse worked like a dream and first... but man did it not last long.  Once I find out what there return policy is I am going to see if I can get one of their much older models :P
4,Box arrived damaged everything else worked as advertised.
5,I have to admit I don't use this mouse for gaming.  I use it for CAD.  I love the programmability of the mouse; allowing me to assign functions to each of the buttons.  I primarily got the mouse because I wanted a mouse with as many buttons as possible.  The mouse has sped up my work flow saving me an estimated hour each day of work.
5,Had a Razor Naga for so long that a couple of the buttons had started to act up. I loved the panel with 12 thumb buttons when playing MMOs but was a bit annoying when on other styles of games. Saw this and thought would be perfect. Am a bit worried about the thumb panels only being held on by a couple of magnets but only time will tell how well it holds up.
3,ProsRGB abilityInterchangeable side plateAdjustable buttonsConsBulkyMissed the perfect opportunity for a secondary right clicker (second right mouse clicker would allow you to program the button as an alt or shift key. Basically turning your 12 buttons on the side into 24 very easy.)Not a lot of preprogrammed quick affects
3,This new version of the naga mouse hardware wise works fine. The three plates so far work well when switching between them the magnets hold them.The main issue with this device is that it does not work with version 2 of their software so your forced to use the beta version three which does not work sell in windows 10. I've read that it has been this way for almost a year. I've tried installing with elevated permissions and running with elevated permissions but it still causes issues.So if you are buying this mouse and plan on using it with their software be aware you might want to purchase one of their other mice or go with another company.
5,Great mouse. Enough said
4,I love this mouse been using it a few weeks only drawback I have is the 12 button side is flat hard for some to determine which button is which on the fly. Several internal memory options great for several game and you can even change the side mid game and it has saves for each side based on what you program each button for.
3,I like the feel of the mouse in my hand and i also like the detachable side pieces too. The only problem I have and I can see a lot of others have is my mouse will do this double click/feel like it doesn't click at all it can get really annoying.
5,Hubby picked this for playing WOW and he loves it!  Enough said.
3,Product is very versatile and for that I'm happy with it.One of the replaceable sides scrapes on my mouse pad so sadly I can't use it for what I'd like other than that a good product for the price.
3,The left click and right click do not always register when you click the button down. Started happening right out of the box have only had the mouse for less than a month. This is especially a problem in games like WoW when your panning your camera around or trying to target stuff and the mouse doesn't register the click it can be very annoying. Every Razer Naga i have purchased over the years has been worst and worst quality it seems. May look into Logitech next time I purchase a mouse.
1,I've had 3 Nagas before this one 2 of them died when the left mouse button snapped off after years of use. Honestly don't have a problem with that I'd used them for years but that breakage is down to an avoidable design flaw: there is no good reason not to have the primary buttons be buttons instead of part of the top shell.Anyway down to my last mouse I went looking for another Naga to buy and found the only one on offer was the trinity. I was skeptical about the removable side panel but I purchased anyway only to find that yes indeed I'm missing abilities because the side buttons simply do not work most of the time. If I use my left hand to squeeze the mouse together while pushing the buttons with my right thumb then sure it works but... I mean that just isn't a workable solution.Will be returning this piece of expensive trash and I guess ordering a replacement top shell for my 2 otherwise functional Naga Epic Chromas.I wish there was another manufacturer producing a 12 key side panel mouse with a tilt wheel. I guess the Logitech G600 exists but it is ugly as hell and has the same issue with the main mouse buttons not being buttons so will eventually fail due to plastic fatigue just like all Nagas eventually do. Too bad the scimitar doesn't tilt it looks like a well designed/built device.
1,Purchased the razor naga at the beginning of 2020. Within the first month a full row of the side buttons had gone out. I was able to fix this issue temporarily by pressing really hard on the ones that weren’t working. This problem would come back a few times randomly. Another issue I have had off and on is the left click will commonly double click or will not be held down when I’m playing a video game and trying to hold the left click down. The quality of this mouse is obviously pretty low for such a big brand. I remember my old razor naga that worked for like 3 years without flaw. If you are buying this item for its trademark don’t do it. They sold out on their quality and no longer have good reliability.If not for quality the mouse itself has a good weight good design. I have average hands and can reach most side buttons easy enough. The buttons are spaced apart enough that you probably wont missclick them. The software is easy enough to configure and doesn’t take long to install and it’s easy to interact with. The software also provides plenty of different options for macros and saving keybinds.
5,I used the original Razer Naga for 8 years. When buying this one I wished I hadn't wasted my time with the old one. The material is so light and feels nice. Having the flexibility of changing the macros is wonderful too for different games.
3,Stopped working after two months was good while it lasted
5,Now that the Razer app/program is fixed it works great. After a few months still feels perfect. I play MOBAs and FPS the mouse is a tad heavy for FPS but still light enough it doesn't matter too much there. The high polling rate makes everything fluid and being able to change to custom preset dpi settings on the fly is great. The side plates are easy to change and feel pretty stable when plugged in.
5,This thing is amazing great for fps and mmo alike just swap out the side boom. Great battery life goes 6 days without charging at all
5,Best MMO mouse or there
5,Comfortable mouse with a lot of flexibility. The panels can be hot swapped with is really nice if you find yourself torn between which panel to use.
5,I am a guy with slightly larger then average hand and I must say I don't think I'll ever use another mouse again. This product is by far the best that I've used from Razer. It's comfortable easy way to fun to play with and so versatile. The mouse also works perfectly with Razer's software Razer Synapse. This free software made by Razer makes it so easy and fun to adjust colors and so on. Would highly recommend this mouse for anyone doing anything on a computer.
5,the easy to use buttons on the thumb make for perfect mmo gameplay! There is also other adjustable thumb panels that can be switched out for shooters and other pc game. A must buy for any computer NERD! :) I came from console and couldn't play ESO like I did with the elite controller. I felt like I was immediately at a disadvantage. This has ultimately changed the PC experience for me.
2,I started getting double clicking problems early this year at right about a year of having the mouse I went through and cleaned it just incase but that was not the issue. I can no longer properly move cameras in games like Minecraft WOW or other games. When holding the Lift click and moving the camera it randomly "stops holding the click" even if you never lift your finger so then the camera stops moving. Then it catches up and starts clicking again. I ended up replacing with something way cheaper that works better and doesn't get me killed.
5,It works well I had two before and they went bad (one the scroll wheel skipped too far ahead after a while the other the left mouse button triple clicked sometimes after a while) so far so good with this one though.
1,the mouse worked fine until synapse opened and started to install. bricked the mouse after that. tried a system restore point and it still didnt work
5,Got this for my Fiancé he loves it best gaming mouse he has ever had an the man is always playing games he is working on getting all there brand stuff for his computer
5,Nice solid and very colorful! The mouse itself works like a charm and was surprised to see that the changeable face plates were magnetic but it works out! Only problem was that despite being new the packaging was a bit damaged but everything inside was still fine.
3,Very light weight which for some might be okay but in combination with the cheap feeling plastic makes the overall feeling very cheap. This is unexpected from my experience with the 4 previous Razer mice I have owned.
4,The interchangeable side is really neat. My only real complaint with the mouse is the scroll wheel feels a bit heavier than my previous razer mice/takes more force to turn one increment. However most of my mice have either had their scroll wheel or their middle click sensor fail in some way so here's to hoping that it's actually a design improvement.
3,This mouse is great for what I'm doing (which is gaming) and its great. it only came with 2 different customizations but I put the 12 button one on and it works great!
2,After using it for just 3 months one day it stopped working properly. I had to install Razer Synapse to fix it.
4,I have a bit of a challenging clicking on the numbered buttons but that’s more of a personal problem and not an issue with the mouse itself.
5,Amazing mouse! I am a razor fanboy and I have always had a razer mouse. This was an upgrade from a naga pro and it was a fantastic upgrade! I thought I wasn’t going to use the extra sides (I mainly use the 12 button) but I do use them frequently!
5,I don’t game as much as I do actual work and to have all the functionality of the buttons on the side really helps my get through work projects easier!
5,Whether we wanted it or not we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected but with the right team we can punch through those defenses take this beast out and break their grip on Freehold.
4,Its great I wish it still had the button on the bottom to change to Numpad.  The program can be annoying to use otherwise 5 stars!  Sturdy and comfortable mouse great for gaming!
5,Ordered this to replace my previous Razor Naga from 2012.  Very pleased with the overall quality and hand feel of the new mouse.  The new version comes with the added bonus of several different side plates which have different configurations for side buttons.  Definitely recommend.
5,I like it was able to customize it to the user. I bought it ass Christmas gift and it’s been a game changer from what I’ve heard.
5,I like the interchangeability between the different styles of side buttons. Used a 12 button Naga and a regular Deathadder for years. Having the ability to change which style of mouse I want to use for different games is awesome.
1,I ordered this because my original Razer Naga MMOG mouse was failing. Despite looking like it this thing isn't even close.It weighs almost nothing so there's no tactical feedback when moving it and even the lightweight cord on it jerks it back around when you let go of it.It's wider than the original not a lot but just enough that it's not comfortable to hold.The Mouse Button 4 and 5 that the original had along the edge of the left button are missing.And the worst thing is the buttons on the 12 button pad on the side are about 3 times as tall as on the original making it impossible to hold without constantly pressing one of the first row!I can't recommend this one at all. I'm currently trying to figure out of the original can be opened up to possibly fix the failing right button so I can return this piece of junk.
5,Great
5,bought this for ffxiv was not disappointed. I cant imagine using a normal mouse again lol
2,I bought this mouse about six months ago after my previous Naga (The Naga Epic Chroma I believe) was on deaths door after about two and a half years of being my daily mouse. With the Trinity I see what they were trying to do and while the ability to switch out button configurations is cool it comes at the cost of quality it seems.Within the last few days I've started to get the double clicking issue which makes most games more or less unplayable. I've tried cleaning out the mouse to the best of my ability and that hasn't changed anything.On top of that there has always been a software issue. While the Naga software allows you to link profiles to games I've never got it working. That is I've always had to manually switch profiles.I hate leaving bad reviews but I can't recommend Razer products moving forward.
5,Almost half the weight of my trinity! The buttons feel smoother as well. Gonna buy another for a backup. This will be my go to forever!
2,After a year of use the right click started malfunctioning for me. If I simply right click it will work 99% of the time but if I right click and hold it goes in and out. I use it mainly for gaming and anyone that plays a moba or mmorpg know how much right clicking is required to play those types of games. I play a lot of FFxiv and wow and in those games pressing and holding down right click is a commonly used function to make your char face a certain way. you can then hold left click to move you char in the direction your facing. Having said that unless i press down rather hard on the right click wile im moving my character will stop in place and have a extremely annoying stop and go effect among other nuisances.
2,I bought this to replace my old Razer Naga Epic Chroma mouse because it was incompatible with their new 3.0 software. The build quality is not as good and the interchangeable plates can cause issues. Ultimately my 4 button on the 12 button plate broke after about 2 years of use. I'm gonna be purchasing a Logitech G600 instead because with Razer you pay top dollar for iffy quality these days.
2,In less than two months of gaming with the Razer Naga Trinity both my right and left mouse buttons have degraded significantly. Both buttons now have a slower "bounce-back" and the quality of the press feels significantly worse. I have only owned Razer mice for years now and have never had issues in the past. This mouse is expensive and I feel I did not get my moneys worth.
2,I really didn't like using this mouse. It tracks fine and it's nice to have up to five different DPI settings in the mouse but I found it extremely uncomfortable to use. I have large hands and even this mouse was a bit too wide for me. If the side panels were indented to allow the thumb to rest more naturally I don't think it'd be as big a deal. Also the mouse is very light which I personally didn't like. The interchangeable side panels are a neat idea though. Also the mouse's lights keep flashing rather than rotating steadily through colors while at rest and I don't enjoy that much either. It's responsive though and moves quite nicely across my mousepad. There are better options out there.
2,This listing is somewhat of a lie - while the mouse is comfortable and works well Razor apparently hasn't updated their Mac software in multiple operating systems (several years) so you can't actually program the mouse buttons or control the lighting on any machine that has updated it's operating system since 2018 or so.For other would-be buyers I tried several suggested workarounds from various tech articles around the internet and none of them worked.I'm saddened that Razor has abandoned 30% of the US and 15% of the world and annoyed that Amazon is marketing this is a Mac compatible gaming mouse.
2,Owned this mouse for a year and a half. The quality on the surface is high but durability is lacking as the buttons wear out rather quickly. I love the changeable side panel for the different types of games I play. In every way this mouse is worth the money EXCEPT in the longevity department. I'm greatly disappointed that this mouse charges you the cash for high quality and then delivers low quality where it really counts the most used button on the mouse. I have owned other Razer products and still use the keyboard made by them. But here I am 15 months later in the market for a new gaming mouse.
2,Item was advertised as new. Received a mouse that was already scratched up from use. Also was missing the 7 button side plate.
5,I bought this to replace my failing Razer Naga. The new features like custom chroma lighting and different side button panels is great. I only wish they kept the 2 mouse buttons on the side of the left mouse button. Instead they relocated them to below the scroll wheel which I'm still trying to get used to.I have large hands so I like the slightly larger size compared to the old Naga.
5,This is a really nice and durable mouse. It is responsive and sleek. I enjoy being able to program it easily. I use it daily and it has lasted for about a year so far.
5,At first the wheel was stiff to the point it kind of was upsetting but after using it for a day or 2 it calmed down. I don't think I'm going to ever switch the side panel but the option is always there if I decide to play a game that requires the input.
1,My mouse worked mostly fine for about a year and suddenly out of the blue whether the cumulative bloatware updates or the general cheap nature of this thing none of the macros work while playing games. There's no firmware or support for this mouse. Synapse is essentially worthless. If you buy this mouse you will be tossing it out eventually as it breaks itself. Stay away.
3,The very first naga razer I had was one solid piece. These newer ones last only about half as long as the time as the original naga. Once those little connections between the removable piece And the main hand piece are damaged the mouse is no longer good. Please bring back the OLD RAZER version!!One solid mouse. I don’t need 6 different attachments I will never use please. Thank you.
5,I have used a Naga Trinity for a long time for WoW - I am glad that there is a wireless version now.
5,I bought this as a used (like new) product. It came just as advertised. Everything works fine and the unit was in great condition.
5,The 3 button panel configurations are great to get the right feel. replaced my Logitech with this and SO glad I did. Absolutely love this mouse.
5,It doesn't have a script for macros.Logitech has a lua script for macros.I hope razer add this function near in the future.Thanks!
5,Was bigger than I expected definitely made to fit an adults hand! So if you're buying for your kid know that!
1,I really wanted to get a new mouse because the one I use for work was getting outdated and the scroll wheel was starting to fail which seems common with Razer mice.However I really should have read the low reviews and thought otherwise.When I got the mouse and tried to use it the first day everything seemed fine though I had some weird issues with my Nari headset mic not working and I had to reload Synapse to make it work.Fast forward to day 2... I noticed while playing minecraft that the cursor kept getting stuck thought maybe it was a stuttering issue in the game. But then I was noticing the same thing when on my desktop. Every couple of seconds the mouse would randomly freeze on the screen. (Clearly bad for gaming)I have noticed the same double-clicking issue that others have reported but I'm not seeing it as often.TL;DR Don't buy this mouse. It's way too expensive for its terrible performance.
5,Honestly I love this thing. It’s perfect for me and my hubby. I prefer the 12 buttons for Diablo III and he prefers the 2 buttons. So this is a perfect option. Love it
5,Great mouse it's switches are nice and the set up combos are great.  Doesn't feel cheap like other brands that claim to be "for gamers".  You should get the wireless charging dock they have as well.
5,I used to have the naga 2014 and now own this it's highly responsive and great battery life
5,this mouse is amazing it is great for people with big hands and especially the multiple buttons that you can hot swap at will makes this mouse the biggest contender over the logitech g502.
2,I don't know if the company was sold or what but the quality of the Naga is crap now. This mouse lasted about 4 months before I started having issues. The side buttons just decide to start malfunctioning randomly. Pushing #3 will register as if I'm pushing #5 and then eventually it just doesn't register at all. Unplugging and plugging back in only helps for a few minutes if at all. I actually have a very old Naga from 2010 I had retired but kept just in case and I had to go back to that. It has normal wear and tear issues because it lasted for 3 years but it works better than this new one. Sad.
5,I owned the original naga epic and loved it. I didn't have a use for 12 macro keys though. The trinity is great because it still has a great feel although you lose the other side pieces for the right side of your hand which is unfortunate but the ability to switch between 2 6 or 12 macro buttons is great.
5,Like that I can pair it with the other razor devices for a great gaming experience.What can I say but wow. 16000dpi for when you want to move across the screen with a muscle twitch. Thankfully it's fully adjustable! Use the software to set up your 5 determined speeds. Not only the dpi of the mouse but to separate the y and x axis a must if you have a16:9 screen!
2,The interchangeable side buttons are great for gaming but the right and left mouse buttons don't reliably register after only a year of use. Can't drag anything because the left mouse button releases while you're still holding it.
3,The new naga is way bigger in the hand than the previous design.  I dislike that.  Also the new placement of mouse buttons 4 & 5 behind the scroll wheel is inconvenient and hard to utilize.  In addition MB 4 & 5 are defaulted to adjust the dpi up and down instead of acting like additional mouse buttons.  This "feature" was not intuitive and I had to download Razer's proprietary synapse software to remap the buttons to just act like normal buttons.  Really dislike the  new design overall.  I do not care about the interchangeable side plates and this "feature" is primarily why the design changes occured.  It's a step back for the Naga in my opinion.
5,works great nice interchangeable side buttons-controllable RGB thru software including button profiles for each game-only down fall is its big and heavy but still woks great with razer mouse pad and my 15 y\o says he likes it
5,If you need a wireless mouse with a lot of programmable buttons on it this is the one it’s perfect
2,I started getting double clicking on my left mouse button about six months ago. At first I thought it was me and not the mouse. However it's gotten worse over time to the point where it impacts a lot of my gaming sessions. Sometimes I'm not able to recover from a mistake the double click will cause to happen and that gives a horrible feeling. I bought this mouse because I play a number of games where I like the programmable thumb buttons - and those work great. It's just let down by the double click issue.
2,After being a long time customer trying a different brand of MMO mouse next time.  This has been a recurring issue for my Naga mice either the left or right click degrades after a few months.  This is probably the 6th or 7th razer mouse I've had after being very happy with the first couple.  On this latest one similar to the last few the left click and hold doesn't work.  Last time it was the right click.  I never realized how much I need to left-click and drag or hold until this thing broke.  Now I end up very frustrated when dragging something from my inventory in a game and it picks the wrong thing or in Excel dragging to copy functions.  Left click by itself works okay for the time being.  Watching how to fix this there is a video where superglue is involved but it lets you see how cheap the mechanism for clicking is almost like it's built to fail after a short time.  Additionally Synapse is super slow to come up and why do I need to log in every time... it's a mouse ffs.
3,I love the Razer DeathAdder Elite and just wanted to have more buttons. Unfortunately the Razer Naga Trinity is just not comfortable for my small hand. Possibly not comfortable for even medium size hands. The problem is the shape and extra weight. Unlike numerous other mice I have used the Naga Trinity is bulky heavy and not ergonomic. The main problem is the ring finger rest which makes it much harder to grip and lift the mouse. You are left with using only your thumb and pinky with the extra weight of the mouse can be quite fatiguing and slowing response time. If you are using the 12 button pad it's even harder since your thumb doesn't have a good place to grip.
5,Great comfortable mouse and using it for a bit now and I love it
4,I love everything about this mouse except the middle wheel. It takes some force to get the middle wheel to scroll down. I'm not sure if this is by design or if there is something wrong with my mouse.
3,I loved the features and the removable side plates but it just didn't fit my hand well.  I have rather large fat hands and thought it was just me.  So I bought a different mouse and sent this one to a friend in California and after much use he said the same thing.  He is still using it but complains about the exact same issues.  Again if this mouse fits you then it is an awesome mouse tracks perfectly and the removable side plates are a cool feature.  It is a tad heavy but I like heavy mice.  Good luck and if they would just change the shape a little they would have an awesome mouse!
5,This is my favorite mouse ever. It’s anything and everything you want.
5,The mouse is responsive the side panels change out easy and can switch between profiles easily over a great gaming mouse.
5,Except for keybinds when I play WoW
5,Dont have any complaints good gaming mouse when you want a little easier access to buttons.
1,Always bought $30 mice they would last years.Bought this one figuring the price justified an assumption that this might be the last mouse I buy for a while.6 months of regular use (I probably ran the machine it was on 15-30 hours/week and maybe 2-5 hours/week for videogaming) and the left-click is malfunctioning hard.This mouse is not worth the price.And what is it with the updates? This thing updates more than the windows OS itself. It's a computer mouse... do you understand that? What the hell does it need with updates? You can't make a mouse that doesn't need updates? What is wrong with you?Just don't buy this thing. Sadly I think it was designed by first-year students or lobotomized monkeys or something; the whole thing reeks of grand ideas that never panned out with the R&D costs being responsible for 1. the inflated price and 2. the cheap components of manufacture. Is this the future of mice? God I hope not.I guess I'll give the company itself the benefit of the doubt but pull this unit entirely and go back to the drawing board.
5,As someone who plays a lot of MMOs but just in general a lot of different video games this mouse is second to non and I mean that. I have tried to use some logitech mouses in the past but the side buttons are so useful and responsive. The switchable side panels come off easily to switch out but stay on decently during use. 10/10 I already bought another one for my laptop bag.
5,In my opinion if your desktop computer is specified for gaming & you play MMO's this Razer is a must!I play SWTOR & EVE Online; I keybind my character's abilities on the 12 number keypad on the mouse. I don't macro though; macro-ing in my opinion is for noob/baddies.
1,I got this mouse about a week ago and was really excited for it because I've been needing more mouse buttons for a while now. Which is what makes this all the more disappointing.The first and biggest problem is the mouse tracking. It's bad. When trying to aim with any precision the sensor is liable to get twitchy and make it impossible to land the kind of shot that wins 1v1.Second are the buttons themselves the feature for which I chose this particular mouse. Often when I hit mouse button 3 (the scroll wheel) the press registers as keyboard button 3 which (also disappointingly) is the only way the buttons can be mapped. The effect in D2 my main game is that I'll be trying to throw a grenade in a high-intensity situation only for the mouse to instead fail to register the grenade and instead will switch to my heavy weapon. I've lost several fights this way.This is to say I bought this mouse to improve certain aspects of my game that needed improving. Instead it just created a lot of other problems.
2,Material and other quality is amazing minus the annoying lack of an internal processor so you don't have to run some FPS draining applet to change lighting colors. The thing is though it doesn't fit my hand unless I'm "worshiping the correct angle." The left click button feels right enough but when I'm not seated *PERFECTLY* (per say using it on a keyboard/mouse holder on my bed) it feels awkward as my middle finger naturally wants to be on the right end groove/rest for your ring and pinky fingers... I am not kidding I thought about returning this product Day 1 somewhat outraged. The material quality won me over and I have to adjust how I keep my angling to perfection so 4/5...NOT ergonomic!8 Months after purchase my opinion has only gotten worse. The left click is not functioning well enough for automatic fire and for using snipping tool. BAD MOUSE DESIGN! NOT DURABLE!
2,I got this mouse less than a year ago and its already failed the same way as the one I had before it. Starts double clicking and has issues holding a click (click and drag to highlight text or change camera angle in games). It is now frustrating to use and I guess ill have to look elsewhere for a 12 side button mouse...razor isn't what it used to be.
2,Pros:* Smooth high dpi tracking* Swappable side buttons* Programmable buttons* WiredCons:* Very poor build quality. It *feels* well built but it started developing major problems with buttons double-activating after only a few months and Razer support was quite unhelpful. This seems to be a very common problem with Razer mice in general* Included software is okay for basic button binding but wastes way too much design space on random nonsense that had nothing to do with configuring the mouse. Linking games to profiles also doesn't work.* In theory you can store configuration on the mouse itself but in practice I've never been able to make this work
5,
5,Good product just got in last night. Like the interchangeable side plates. Will keep updated. Using the 2 button plate now. All the bad reviews are driving down the price of this mouse. I got it at 30 buck off the hundred bucks it was just a couple days before. I hope this one holds out I love the side plates. Got a couple of back up logitek mice just in case. Will keep this product updated.
1,I have been using Razer products for many years now and have gotten used to the Naga style gaming mouse. The first that I owned was the best and after many years of use it finally stopped working. I replaced it with the Chroma which has served me well for several years also. Eventually the left click stopped working properly on the Chroma - it occasionally will unrelease when I am holding it down so dragging items end up getting dropped in the wrong location.I decided to replace the Chroma with the latest iteration in the series the Naga Trinity. After about 20 hours of use the left click + drag is almost completely unfunctional. I can hardly drag an email from the inbox to a folder in outlook because 9 times out of 10 it will drop it in the wrong location (the left mouse click releases despite holding it firmly down). Other times the mouse will double click when I only depressed the button once which causes the email item to open up.I would highly recommend avoiding this junky mouse. Razer's quality has greatly declined over the years but their prices certainly haven't. After being a lifelong Razer fan I think my next mouse will have to be a different brand.
3,I am a big fan of Razer products have been using them for year. My Naga Epic that I have been using as my primary mouse for 7 years finally started to die... The right click is having issues. Decided to purchase this naga trinity to replace it. The shape of the mouse has completely changed. Not as big as a fan of this one... dont find it nearly as comfy. I will likely use this for a few more months to try and get used to it. Havent had any major issues with it so I cant say its a bad product. Other Razer mice just seem to be a bit more comfy.
5,Pros:+ Smooth+ Accuracy is top notch; customizable to suit your style+ Plenty of buttons to bind+ Razer Synapse 3.0 software offers cool features for customizationCons:- A little pricey but you get what you pay for.
1,This thing only works sporadically in wireless mode have to keep it plugged in unfortunately I bought it to be a wireless mouse.
5,This can take a bit of getting used to but you can learn it.  I personally prefer the 7 button round plate as it seems more ergonomic for my hand position.
1,So I got this mouse mainly for the 7 button circular panel it was a perfect fit for the games I play. It came in and I was stoked. The feel was nice and the panels were a no brainer to switch out. I load up Siege 6 and set up the binds I want and load up a terrorist hunt. Everything is working great so then I go into casual. Then this is where the issues began.I was confused when it unexpectedly wasn't working at all other than left and right mouse button. In fact the entire thing just wasn't lighting up including the side panel. After looking it over it just seemed that maybe the panel came loose and I hadn't originally put it in right I figured. So go into a new game... now the 1 and 7 aren't working.There seems to be no rhyme or reason for which ones give out if they all don't that is. I just put in the 12 digit panel and that one has all working buttons but still the issue of randomly disconnecting seemingly for moving it in a way it doesn't like. I'm super fine with tolerating this overall but they don't even sell replacement panels. I hate having to go through the process of an entire replacement especially with my work revolving around the computer I can't just up and send this mouse back before getting the replacement I need. Feelsbadman
3,Just as a forewarning the mouse wheel feels like it has the build quality of a child's toy. The way it moves sounds and feels it's as if it has been jimmy rigged from Lego parts.The other parts of the mouse seem OK so far and I do like the option of having the 12 side buttons and the radial style sideplates; however I just can't get over the way the wheel is on this. It makes me realize how much I have taken for granted the smooth responsive wheels on my other mice.
5,I like the Razer products. I had Naga before this and both have worked very well for me. The panels on this one are much better quality than I was expecting. Super easy to switch out even during use. Button layout is nice. Overall very happy with the purchase.
5,I had the Naga before and noticed to difference. I love I can switch out the thumb keys so I don’t have to use the MMO ones all the time and can preserve the lifespan. The ring one is great for FPS like overwatch or LoL just takes a little while to get use to it.
5,Yeah its a phenomenal mouse for gamers and non alike so I give it a 10/10
5,I’ve always used this mouse and always great product.
5,The mouse is very good for gaming. The different plates are very useful for different kinds of games.
5,What's there to dislike? plug and play quick swappable mouse buttons for your gaming pleasure
5,Ahh nothing drives a wedge quite like a gaming addiction. Stop the clicks. Start the licks.
2,I have a naga molten that finally gave out after many years of good use. The old naga is the best mouse there is. But the new naga trinity leaves me missing my old mouse. The ergonomics are awful. It's larger and doesn't really fit to the hand at all. Discomfort after extend use. Which I never had with the molten. But after getting used to the 12-key number pad on my thumb I can't live without it. Speaking of which the thumbpad  buttons on the trinity stick out much more which leads to a lot of accidental hits on those keys for me. There are other brands offering the same feature. But I've always loved razer products. It's a shame that my brand loyalty was a liability in this case. I must say it really does make me sad to see the superb design of the previous naga fade away.
5,What can I say but it's great. Helps me out in Call of Duty and even video editing. Love it.
5,This mouse is pretty good for the price I love the 3 different side for the different types of games I play and it is so comfortable to use. The way it’s designed if perfect for a comfortable fit and grip. Their is one thing though the one side with 2 buttons it’s a little hard to hit at first but as I play with it more it became easier to hit the buttons.
1,I've had this mouse for a while now When I got it I was excited to use it and do some gaming with it.The issue is the magnet connection on the side is defective for my mouse at least you can tell something is wrong because the mouse makes a clicking noise and raises on the front when I'm holding the mouse this causes certain connections to lose their connection making some buttons not work I tested it by putting it back into place and then clicking the buttons that were not functioning putting it back into place by making sure the connections were being made fixed it. however it is so sensitive that any type of holding and clicking makes it shift causing some buttons to lose function. You can also see the lighting going in and out sometimes when moving it around. THE ONE connection that works excellent is the two-button mod. Because there are fewer buttons the connections needed are more likely less important for two buttons to work as opposed to 7 or 12.If I paid 100$ for this and that's the product I received 1/3 functionality I would never recommend. Don't waste your money. I have been using an off-brand mouse since to avoid any chance of the mouse randomly losing connectivity.Always been a fan of the razer accessories but this was disappointing.
5,Rápido envío y el producto es tal cuál lo especificado por el fabricante producto premium.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It works great and is a wonderful mouse... For less than a year. Within that time it will start double clicking randomly fail to hold a press and become useless for all but the most basic of uses.
5,The biggest game changing upgrade I've made in years. If you play an MMO like WoW the 7-12 buttons will instantly change the way you play for the better. I wish the scroll wheel and clicks weren't so loud but I can live with it. Overall 10/10 love it!
5,Awesome mouse! The new software included is very well made. Definitely an upgrade on the Naga Epic. Please note this device is wired not wireless.
3,Very good and easy to use. The only thing I didn't like about it right out of the package was the 2 buttons under the scroll wheel are on-the-fly DPI changers rather than native page forward and back but it is easy enough to change functions although thous functions are not listed in the preset list of functions and have to program the keyboard short cut...8 MONTHS LATER UPDATE: The Left click button no longer works; a quick click results in 1 to 3 input signals click and hold resalts in inconststant flickering signal.
1,Have found Razer products highly glitchy.  I have to stop and unplug this product in the mid of gaming cause it just stops working or it loops itself. I've complained to Razer and have gotten Zero response from them.
5,The Razer Naga trinity is an excellent mouse for any style of gaming wether it's mmo fps and beyond. It has a nice grip on both the thumb and the pinky and ring finger which is very hard addition to come by now a days or also has a very satisfying scroll wheel and best of all it has a customizable side grip to suite your style of gaming. I highly recommend.end buying it
5,I got this mouse for my husband who is getting back into gaming. He loved it! It’s very high tech feeling and really customizable!
1,I have an older model Razer Naga with the Num/123 and wired/wireless switch on the bottom. I used that mouse since February 2013 and it was marvelous. So naturally after it finally started taking a dump I ordered the newest Razer Naga. Well they changed the ergonomics of the whole mouse so now it I press the 6 side key when I mean to press the 3 and the mouse forces me to prop my hand further up on it eliminating my ability to rest my wrist while I use it. The program wasn't too bad to figure out how to assign Numkeys to the side (I have a Razer keyboard with no numpad) but the mouse will not go one whole round in a PvP match without forgetting either the number assignments or what one of the buttons does. One fix is to remove the side panel and put it back on and that works about as well as you'd think it would in PvP. One or two tries of that and maybe your buttons will work again for the rest of the match. This thing is garbage and I am moving on and away from Razer products.
2,While initially it was a great mouse suited every scenario I could need it. Whether playing Warcraft or any FPS game it worked splendidly. I bought this mouse in May it's now October and in the past few weeks I've noticed the health of the left and right clicks deteriorated rapidly. It's at the point where I can't ADS in a shooting game or rotate my camera smoothly in Warcraft. It acts as if it's being released rapidly randomly. Resetting Synapse unplugging it trying different USB ports dusting it nothing works. This mouse is too new and too expensive to die in less than half a year. While initially great the quality just isn't there. This mouse hasn't left my desk there have been no spill or food substances on it. It's just not acceptable to spend this much and have it go out like this. Simply not worth the money unless you buy a warantee or you want to gamble.
1,Had to replace both switches used with omicron D2F-01F-T after minimal use over 2 years. Could no longer hold the mouse button down to click and drag and it would sometimes not even register a click right or left. Seems like the designers were forced to use cheaper switches by the bean counters. Never buying a razer product again. Lost me as a customer. Saving a fraction of a penny on inferior components makes you lose customers. That's my rant have a good day.
5,Another great razer mouse. I would recommend this for all varieties of games and this is one very comfortable mouse
5,Thank you guys for the delivery its good and you delivered it a lot faster than I thought but the packaging was damaged i have a photo of it I actually love keeping boxes for what i buy but i cant now because it’s damaged once again thank you for the delivery I’m enjoying it
5,Best gaming mouse ever you can change the side buttons to your liking and based on ehat your playing
1,I had to replace my original Naga X because after LESS THAN A MONTH it started getting misclicks and it became impossible to play games like WoW because it wouldn't hold a click. Sometimes it would double-click as well. I just recieved my replacement today and I confidently say it has the same freaking issues but this time literally RIGHT out of the box. "Zero chance of misclicks!" my ass what's the point of the new optical sensor if the older mice worked better? If this mouse worked perfectly I'd recommend it whole-heartedly but it doesn't work perfectly at all.
1,I just bought this gaming mouse for the 12 button programmable keys. The hardware itself is working but it requires you to use the Synapse 3 software to configure the macros. The macro software is absolutely horrible. You can specify different macros for each game through "profiles". Well the software doesn't persist the profiles when you try to toggle between them. This results in you blowing away or updating a completely different game than the one you have selected in the software.Additionally if you want default behavior when there is no game running you're out of luck. The default "no game" profile doesn't trigger back on after you leave a game. So if you want to program the macro keys for copy + paste or ALT + F4 you have to kill the software and its services to get the default profile back. You can also come up with a hacky work around by trolling the forums and reading about the many many other people having these exact problems.I will never buy a product from Razer again. It doesn't matter how good their hardware is if their software can't configure it.
4,I really hope this one lasts a year doing ok so far but the last one died. Nothing better on the market so have to hope Razer sorts it's software support (that's gone down hill) and jumps but to the top product.
5,Works great
5,Works great... Glad I purchased this... However being LEFT handed not so much...
1,I don't know what's wrong with the mouse but it won't turn on. I've tried all the troubleshooting and Amazon won't replace it even though it says 90 day support and I purchased it from Amazon Services LLC. I have to return it to the manufacturer and do without a mouse until they decide to send me one. It's pretty expensive for a mouse to just stop working for no reason.
1,Not much else needs to be said here. You can use it as a regular mouse plus it allows you to enter the numbers 1-19 with a click of a button! Useless until Synapse 3 decides to run on Mac.Side note: it claims Synapse 2 will support Mac but only if the mouse is directly wired into it - well the Macbook Pro doesn't have a USB 3.0 so even if Synapse 2 WOULD work it still can't be used with this mouse.
5,Love this mouse it’s accurate and comfy for for a medium sized hand.
5,I thought the connection would be bad because you can remove the 3 different plates but I haven't had any issues with them so far.
5,IMy husband got it for me and at first I thought I wouldn’t like it because my hands are smaller but I LOVE it! I don’t use the 12 buttons yet but I really like the rounded button Set up option. Definitely would buy again.
2,This is my go-to mouse for gaming but the last few purchases have failed within months of use.The left mouse button wears out extremely quickly to the point that you have to click it a certain way to get it to register. God forbid you need to left click and hold because while it may (80% of the time) catch the click it won’t register you holding the mouse button down. For practical purposes this isn’t awful but in a gaming situation (what this mouse is designed and marketed for) that could make the difference between a win and a loss.I love this mouse I do but now I’m looking for a more permanent replacement because I can’t afford to keep replacing this mouse every 3 - 4 months.
5,All the buttons are nice and tactile the side plates are easy to swap and super useful the mouse is comfortable and the sensor is great. This is a versatile and decent mouse for all types of gaming and gamers. It's probably the best 12-pad mouse there in part because you can take the 12-pad off for games that don't need it. It does very well when used as a normal mouse and holds in own in CS:GO and Overwatch.
5,I bought this to replace my naga 2014 mouse.  I'll probably never use another mouse now that I have all there styles of mouse in one.  The NAGA 2014 was pretty old and never had any issues until recently.  I expect this one to do that same.
5,My husband loves this mouse. He says it works perfect for gaming and is super comfortable. He also LOVES the buttons! Must be a gamer thing
4,Cheaper than most department stores so I bought it. Bigger than expected. I'm used to the orochi 2013 so huge jump. I don't like that the dpi settings don't have a setting between 4500-9000. Build could be better. otherwise great mouse. I use it all the time.
5,Although im not sure what ill use the other two set ups on the mouse it is great for gaming.
1,I wanted to like this mouse. Really. The idea of a wireless MMO mouse is fantastic and to my knowledge Razer is the only mainstream brand on the market providing this product to consumers. It would be a dream come true if the thing actually worked. In wired mode it works just fine exactly like you should expect it to. In wireless however (the reason you buy this version of it in the first place) just flat out won't respond to inputs properly. The cursor jumps sporadically all around the screen even when the DPI is low (less than 2000 on a 49 inch screen). It also stutters. A lot. Frankly this is unacceptable from a product that I paid a serious premium for. For a $150 product it should ship with some sort of quality control. I spent HOURS reading forums and searching up potential fixes all to no avail. That said I'm not the only one with this problem so it's clear that Razer either doesn't know what's wrong with it or more likely they don't care. Returning tomorrow and never even considering another Razer product.
5,Best buy ever!! And the price was way better than even razor itself.
5,After a couple razer devices I have learned that you should always buy the warranty the naga mice tend to fail after about 1.5 years.Some of the mechanical side buttons were not working on the first one; I sent it back and had a new one sent to me in a day.
5,Works great side note it does work with other the trinity 7 button side panel not software wise though. I hope they add this. Wireless works very well.
3,I’m not a fan of the removable plate covers. This is the third naga I’ve owned and the first with the removable plates. The plate with the most buttons is the reason I purchased this mouse if not connected correctly the numbers 3 6 9 12 will not work. I suggest finding a naga that doesn’t have the removable plates to avoid this issue.
1,The charging cable for this mouse is effectively proprietary. Very few normal micro-b cables will fit. There is no reason why it couldn't be wider to accept about any micro-b cable. They literally designed it this way to drive you to the wireless charging dock. This is the singular most annoying design choice Razer has ever made. It's a shame all the other competitors to this mouse just don't quite feel as good because they're definitely longer lasting and don't make dumb decisions like this.
2,Had this a little over a year and a half and it has started double-clicking every time I click the mouse. This is also not my first Razer mouse which has done this. Really nice up until this but could not recommend buying this mouse now.
2,I'd give this mouse 5 stars except for the ridiculously bloated software that needs to be installed. The initial install was 411 MEGABYTES. For a mouse. You have to create an account and hand over the keys to your computer. Again just to use a mouse.All I want is a Windows driver that will enable me to use the buttons and an optional application layer that will allow me to set mouse features.  But in my Task Manager I see seven (that's not a typo) separate Razer processes running with some using up to 90MB memory. I'd like that memory to play games if that's possible not to support Razer's marketing department.Ridiculously bad software design. Eclipses all the other features completely.
2,This mouse worked pretty well for a while but then the left click kept not activating almost 90% of the time I would try to click and drag with my mouse and it would drop the window because the mouse wasn't reading my click. I looked up online that this a common issue and just cleaning out the dust will help it only helped for 30 mins I have never had an issue like this with any mouse I have used in the past till I got a Razer mouse.Those issues aside it is well made and does fit in my hand very well it was a great mouse until the button started having uses which ended making it useless.
5,Been using Razer mice since I started pc gaming. I had been using the razer epic chroma  since 2014 and bought this as a replacement. I am not disappointed in the quality or the software. Everything I need to play MMO’s and ARPG’s.
4,I found the small buttons difficult to differentiate. However I’m getting more used to them and I think that it will be excellent for A one handed person.
2,The mouse itself is exactly what I needed and upon a lengthy setup for it to work with Razer's software I loved it for gaming... mostly. Some of the side buttons decide not to work until the side is taken off multiple times and readjusted which causes many issues in competitive titles. Then comes the issues with Razer Synapse. Upon turning on my computer the mouse will be working fine but it won't be recognized in Synapse which will cause extensive troubleshooting for a mouse I spent $150 on.
5,I particularly like that the button panels are "hot-swappable". Like using the two button panel for internet surfing then you decide to play your favorite game but after the game starts you realize that you dont have that oh-so-convenient thumb button panel at your disposal so instead of having to stop and close everything just swap that thing out without missing a beat. Love it. Great for Arma 3.
5,i personally use the 1-7 set most. my previous naga Hex (6key) is no longer available and i use it for games like terraria minecraft World of warcraft and many others. it feels comfortable the plates are easy to exchange if you need to swap  side plates. razor also has the cool lighting effects.5 star.
1,Normally I don't review things because usually it might just be a one-off issue. But this seems very common unfortunately. So overall the IDEA of this mouse is great. But after 3 months I started experiencing the left click issue. Sometimes it registers double clicks on single clicks from the user. Also the most annoying part is the click and drag does not hold this is likely tied to a second click registering during your drag. This is extremely frustrating and renders the mouse unusable. No I did not open my mouse or use a youtube hack fix I don't have time for that. Unfortunately now I am 80 bucks in the hole and in the market for a new mouse. For now this 5-year-old G502 mouse I have is working just fine. Unfortunately I will not be purchasing Razer mice in the future not just because of this case but because this issue seems to run rampant with these mice in particular just from doing a search. I thought I would be able to at least get an exchange but I had other things to do so I was not able to get to this until a few months after it started happening. I just switched back to my old mouse to complete my tasks. Now its out of warranty after 6 months or so and I am stuck with it.
4,Gifted to my mom for christmas. She loves it. Feels very sturdy. looks as pictured. No complaints thus far.
1,Has issues with side buttons failing to register and with charging on the dock. Contacts for both need to be cleaned fairly frequently with rubbing alcohol.
2,After 1 year the 'increase dpi' button on the top doesn't seem to work anymore. There was always a problem using the pair of buttons there (one would register the other). The profile switching is still quirky and the OSD still doesn't work in the primary game I play.
2,Can't rate it more than a 2 because the battery doesn't even last a day of use.Wireless works great with no lag experienced.
2,I just looked at the other brands but I'm going to burn another 100 bucks on the Naga. I really love the thumb buttons in the circle 7 button configuration and no body else does it. This is where I predicted the Naga would fail instead the left click or mouse 1 has broken. A left click will reliably work however left click hold is erratic releasing itself randomly it seems. I will crack it open when my replacement gets here tomorrow. Maybe that copper spring wore out after a year or there is a bad solder. 50 million clicks my keister.
5,One of the best gaming mouse I have purchased. Light smooth and it works.Going on 3 months use and I am very happy with it.
5,I love this mouse I dont use the separate attachments often but they are good to have it makes it easier for me to change my sensitivity settings at the click of a button instead of pausing and doing all that works great for me
5,Great mouse for mmo's. Love how easy it is to switch the side panel if I want a nice change. Hopefully this model will not have an issue with buttons wearing out fast. Only time will tell and it took about two years to wear out on the last mouse which was an earlier model without the new changing panels.
4,Was good jitterclicking was not quite what I thought it would be but overall a good product!
3,Day 1 was good. But from day 2 on the mouse is having connectivity issues. I suspect it is the side plate as it often changes to a different color than configured. Seems like a good idea on paper... But having problems already and i shouldve just gotten a dedicated 7 or 12 button mouse
4,Works as advertised.
5,Excellent piece of equipment to have
1,The mouse itself is fantastic. It does everything I need it to do. Unfortunately after 4 months of use the charging cord stopped working so once the mouse battery was drained I haven’t been able to use it.  No big deal right just get a new charging cord? I contacted razer and my mouse is still under warranty. Great! But they no longer sell the charging cord. I have emailed back and forth with them a dozen times and they want video evidence me to contact the original Amazon seller etc. it’s been 2 weeks since I reached out to Razer and they still have not done anything at all to assist me in getting this mouse back up and running. All I need is a new charging cord I even offered to purchase a new cord I’m not asking for a free handout. But they won’t even do that. Razer support is absolutely atrocious.
5,2nd time I buy one first one last me around 3years o so pretty good for something i smash a lot in MMORPG
2,Fantastic mouse WHEN it is working properly. Buyers beware because there is a known issue with the right click not holding (important function for most pc games) with no real solution but to replace the microswitch yourself. Bought the mouse August 2020 and it is only June 2021 and the mouse is pretty useless for gaming. I don't think the average consumer would want to deal with this sort of issue after a year or so of normal gaming.
4,At first the scroll felt weird now I like it I love the big size because I have big hands
1,I loved this mouse. I used its macros to speed up 3d modelling I did and its hundreds of shortcuts and hard-to-remember macros. Then after 5 months my left click button would sometimes double click or click and release without me actually letting the button go. This made any click-and-drag operation impossible and it took me a week to figure out what was actually going on with my problems. I did a bit of research on this issue and it seems that the double clicking / misclicking issue is common on razer mouses - I've seen forum posts and youtube videos on this from 2011! So this problem has existed and is still not fixed 10 years ago. The fact that my now $10 mouse - which I have had for a year as a replacement - outlasts this $90 absolutely floors me. I contacted razer and they sent me a replacement Naga but quite frankly I don't think I'll even use it if I know it won't even last one year!
5,I previously purchased one for $50 and it was wireless it was from a different company and it was nowhere near the quality this company has been making GameWare for a long time and it shows
5,I don't normally buy mouses but this came from a recommendation from my co-worker who games a ton. Great mouse and great software that comes with it for ultimate customization. I feel like a real workplace wizard now.
5,Love this mouse it lets me customize all the buttons and change everything to my needs
4,Pricey but well made.
3,This doesn't just work as intended out the box you gotta fiddle with it a lot to get the 12key side to work properly. Magnets hold it on and sometimes they dont line up or my personal fav is the lights not working but the keys do.Once it was all working then no issues. Just takes some time.
5,I like how is comes with 2 other detachable buttons plates.  Very configurable and easy on the wrist as well.
1,Dear god this has to be the worst shaped mouse ever. I have massive hands and this thing still hurts to use for more than 10 minutes. also the grip on the sides must be some kind of joke. To me it's obvious the grip is awful so you go and buy the razer grip tape stuff they sell. the action on the main buttons is also ridiculously lite requiring little pressure to actuate leading to a ton of mis-clicks. overall this mouse is strictly worse than even the worst Chinese gaming mouse I've used. If you need a decent MMO mouse there are better options out there. if you need an all arounder get any variation of the Logitech g502 and you'll be far happier even if you have large hands as I originally thought that mouse small. Still rather use a small mouse than experience hand pain.
1,The people at Razer are basically thieves selling this product for what they do. This mouse is complete garbage. I have purchased it twice now thinking the first was just defective. Left click was firing off rapid iouble clicks when holding it down on the first mouse.  Now with this mouse the  left click constantly gets stuck cant drag etc. I have to blow into it to get it to work but I'm sick of having to do that all throughout the day.  Apparently it isn't dust its some kind of static charge on the sensor. For the price they should be ashamed you could buy 5 better mice for 100 bucks. I also have a crazy expensive keyboard from them too (nearly 200 bucks) and the jerks don't even light up the special characters on your keyboard for using with shift. Can you believe that? But they will sell you those keys for your 200 dollar keyboard for an extra 40 bucks. It is a real shame this company used to stand for quality now they are just cash grabbing till they run their name into the ground and disappear into oblivion.
5,nice mouse everything is great accept scroll wheel is not smooth but you get use to it
5,For gaming
1,ordered this thing on December 2 2019 and the right click doesn't register fully when your holding it down to move around in the game I play or even miss clicks. this problem started about a week ago(june 13 2020 ) so I have owned it for a total of 7 months and it has already started to fail … I have only owned razer mouses to game with and this one was very disappointing as the other ones I have used lasted 2 - 3 years and actually still probably work better than this one if I plugged them back in … but I wanted to start fresh with the new computer build so I guess I will have to go purchase a corsair mouse now to give them a shot . this mouse is MUCH bigger feeling than their razer naga and naga pro (what I had before) which has made it uncomfortable from the beginning but hey I figured I could get use to it … turns out I don't have to since it will break this soon and I can just replace the hunk of cheap plastic that it is.
4,The physical quality is good and feels like a solid mouse. The side button don’t feel like cheap plastic. I marked it down to 4 stars because the software is buggy and sometimes my profiles don’t save button layouts. It could’ve been user error but hard to tell.
5,The quality of the mouse is very good the product is very good such as narrative ownership I like it very much recommend to buy!
5,Bought it for a male friend with large hands. The mouse is too big and bulky for smaller hands However he absolutely LOVES this mouse. This is the second one he has owned and the last one lasted several years.
4,The materials are high quality and the mouse is very good at customization but not all of the buttons are not all easily accessible from a neutral hand position.
4,Honestly with the software and the just ease of playing MMO's/MOBAs(Whatever you're into) it makes gaming a lot more enjoyable. I give it 4 stars because all I really wanted was the OG naga mouse with the 12 buttons and I had to pay for the trinity.
1,I used to love the 2014 version of the razer naga. It was great and lasted at least 2 years which I think is acceptable for my level of play. I am currently going to my third Razer Naga Trinity which seem to have the issue of double clicking which makes it impossible to play certain games. I bought a trinity in August 2019 and by April of 2020 the right button kept double clicking forcing me to return it to razer for a replacement. During the time it took to replace the mouse I decided to buy another one since I needed it for gaming and it was taking them a few weeks to process a return. The mouse I bought in April 2020 5 months later is experiencing the same issue of double clicking after moderate use since I have not been gaming as much these days. I will be returning this mouse and if my replacement that was sent to me has the same issue a few months from now I will be looking for a new gaming company.
5,The perfect mouse! It uses Razer chroma meaning I can be an obnoxious RGB gamer at my finest! The cord is soft fabric meaning it won't frey. The interchangeable sides are wonderful! They are great because I use my mouse for a lot of different things.
5,Got for my SO for Christmas to replace his 10+ year old one. Perfect replacement for his old mouse and easy to set up and sync with his PC. He games a lot so it was important to have the side buttons for him.
3,NOT FOR BIG HANDS. I’ve never really had an issue with Razer before till now. This is not for people with big hands. I bought it and it’s just too small. Part of my hand doesn’t touch the mouse at all because it’s small.The pics show how my death adder helps rest my on it while the trinity doesn’t because it’s short and small.It’s a good product and the pieces snap into place very easy and quick but it’s made for players with small hands. I can’t give it a bad review because it’s a good product but personally not satisfied with it
1,I would not recommend. You first have to install the Razer garbage software to make things work correctly. Then after less than 2 years of use it is not functional anymore.
3,I've owned a handful of high cost mice and this one is by far the cheapest and most shoddy build I've seen. I used to own a Razer Naga and was hoping this would live up for Classic WoW but the scroll wheel is SO bad. It has so much resistance that it hurts my finger to spin and sometimes it spins easy and sometimes it gets nearly stuck. Would not recommend
5,Gran producto
5,As described
1,I have been using this mouse for nearly 9 months and it was perfect. I was a huge razer fan while using many of their producst. But as I can see over the years the quality of the products somewhat changed. I assume that because of the usage time of the produtcs before they break down is significantly reduced in recent years. My razer naga (2014) lasted nearly 2.5 years but my last mouse only 9 months.As many of users mentioned my mouse had the same problem with the left button. It started to double click at first and went to non responding mouse button in 1 day. I am trying to send my mouse back to them for investigation but at the moment all I get is that Amazon is not included in Warranty procedure. I am going to edit my review as the process goes on.As a result I can tell that Razer had some really good quality products back then and I still like to use them. However with the current situation I would say to rethink before buying. Hope you will be more lucky with your product.
5,Smooth and quick. Exactly what you want.
5,Nothing to complain about
2,I owned the previous generation Razer Naga and it was my favorite mouse and I had it for years and used it a ton. Then it was time to upgrade and despite the mixed reviews on this version I decided to go ahead and try this Naga out in hopes that I would have good luck with it. Unfortunately this mouse started to screw up after about 1 month of use and I did more research and switched to the Logitech G600 and I haven’t looked back since. Don’t buy this Naga.
2,Purchased to "upgrade from my 10 year old Naga Molten edition..Literally did not even plug it in. The quality of this is mouse is worth $5 at walmart. Disappointed in Razer new products.The cord is very cheaply wrapped there are 2 less buttons near the left mouse button and it feels like I may break it... I liked how heavy the old one was.I appreciate quality products and they are going more towards cheap and mass produce.
5,I previously gave this a 1 star as the mouse I recieve was defective from day one but Razer gave me a 99dollar store credit to purchase a new one.  I had to pay taxes on the item . gut the shippiing was free. I will buy from razer again I have there keyboard and mouse and mouse pad as well all great products
5,I was hesitant buying this for my gamer boyfriend because he has been using an older Naga that is no longer made and he was really attached to it. However he loves the new software and was very excited about getting this mouse for christmas.
5,Really cool and easy to use mouse customization for side buttons are great and easy software the only issue I’d say is the weight of the mouse. Especially for FPS shooters it may take some time getting use to
2,I purchased the Razer Naga Trinity because my other Razer mouse started to exhibit left-click problems after three years. Now I am experiencing the same left-click issues with this mouse. The difficulties include uncommanded double or multiple clicks and intermittent left mouse button release while dragging. This problem is so irritating that it has forced me to switch to a substantially less capable mouse to do usual computer activities. This is also problematic during gaming because of all the same reasons.I reached out to Razer to provide me with some vendor perspective. They put me through troubleshooting steps which included disabling and uninstalling Razer Synapse paired with mouse unplugging replugging. They also asked me to clean the left click button with compressed air. All measures were accomplished now I must RMA.I am extremely disappointed and saddened with Razer mouse quality. I have many Razer products from pads mice and keyboards. I hope this is just a production lot issue and does not translate to the replacement.
5,The go-to standard for MMO mice.
5,Now I have an amazing K/D and I'm banging Timmy's mom. **** you Timmy!!
4,This is my favorite mouse. After using the Razer Naga Trinity every other mouse feels meh. However its not perfect. The left click feels a little bit loose after 3 month use and the scroll wheel could be better.
1,I've had this mouse for about 2 years now and about everything has gone wrong with it. About a year ago started getting the double click/inability to hold click on the right mouse button. Now the left button does the same. The mouse sometimes 'crashes' until the faceplates are taken off replaced. When the mouse is plugged in it often takes 5 attempts for windows to recognize the device. Synapse 3 is unreliable software. My old naga lasted me years this one has been hell since just under a year after purchase.
3,Started to double click after a month. This mouse can't take the clicks.
2,I'm officially getting the now WELL-KNOWN double click issue. It's taken me two hours to do a 45 min task because I'm trying to work around this amazing piece of hardware. I spent $100 on this to replace my (now discontinued) Naga Chroma which is an actual price gouge because the Naga Chroma was $60 and you're tacking on two other faceplates that idgaf about for an extra $40 and on top of that you can't even get the actuation springs right?I give it two stars solely because this is an otherwise solid though needlessly pricey MMO gaming mouse but this actuation issue completely kills anything I am trying to do especially when it requires precision (video/audio editing).
5,Great products wish I had found it sooner.
5,The only thing I wish about this mouse is that the product came with some sort of case or stand to store the extra button options. Awesome mouse otherwise.
2,Usually these mice will last at least 1-2 years of regular use before they start to stick or get non-responsive but they seem to be getting worse by the year.  I bought one less than a month ago and it's already glitching out buttons will randomly stop working until I unplug it and plug it back even with up to date drivers / software.  This will most likely be the last naga purchase I'll make given their price point I would expect higher quality but all they've seemed to do is decline in quality year by year.
5,This device is hands down my favorite computer accessory. The ultra-versatile plates are so easy to use and look beautiful in action and the Razer program (while frustrating with other devices) works like a charm with the mouse. I wish Razer would come out with a dpi adjustment plate (or additional plate options in general for the Naga) similar to the Corsair "sniper" button mouses.
2,Very disappointed. Lovely mouse. Upgraded from the Naga Epic Chroma because of stuttering issues not being taken care of. Only had the mouse for about two weeks before it stopped turning on. No light when charging no sign of life when plugged directly into my pc nothing.Amazing mouse while it worked. But after reading a few similar reviews I'd like to warn anyone considering this item. Maybe wait till this issue is resolved. Though Razer never seems to fix their problems.
4,Awesome mouse aside from the fact it tends to double-click when least expected.
4,All works and it's great but there can be issues with the side buttons occasionally
5,I love this mouse. the responsiveness and feel is perfect. The lighting is a bonus. This is the best mouse I have ever owned. On a side note Amazon customer service is amazing. The first one they sent out didnt make it to me and they were supper quick to send me a replacement.
2,It physically feels great to use. For ~2 months.  It WILL begin to fail within 2-3 months. Either your left mouse clicks will double click or you will try to drag + drop something and the click-hold will fail.I love the concept but the implementation is a buggy mess. I bought TWO just to see if it was a fluke (before I bothered to read other reviews). They both have this issue.Pick one of the 3 configurations you like and buy that elsewhere. That's my best suggestion.
5,Great customization for different types of games you want to play. Product has stood the test of time very well and i'll continue buying Razer in the future.
2,Only worked as wired mouse after 1 month. Use only a handful of times.
5,I have used razer exclusively while this is the NEW naga the problem is that your old profiles for the naga will not work with the trinity this is just bad programming by razer I spent years building my gaming library profiles and now all is wasted.
5,This mouse is the best. Although maybe too heavy for gaming its unrivaled in productivity.
2,Loved this mouse for the first six months. Eventually the middle mouse button started double clicking no amount of macros or cleaning could stop it and then one day it just stopped responding. Fantastic design switching out the side panel for shooters mmo's and work is an awesome flexible design and it's SUPER slick to adjust to the new configuration on the fly love the software and adjusting the chroma controls and it's honestly the best mouse I've ever had but the components are not built to last. Anticipate that this is a "need a new one in under a year" type model.
1,I really wanted to like this mouse but from the start it was having issues.  First off the idea of changeable side plates for work and play configurations was a great idea but I found the mouse to constantly need multiple clicks to respond.  The scroll wheel is so high it becomes annoying to move your finger up to use it or push down to click.  For the price I would have expected a more comfortable mouse instead this seems to be made for smaller hands even to the point where ones pinky finger is simply hanging out on the side with nothing to rest on.  I would look elsewhere for a gaming mouse.
5,It was two days late but my partner loved his birthday present.
5,Love the way it works and responds
2,If this mouse was produced with quality part its would be amazing!! The design of switching out the three different side button panels is brilliant for gamers that play different types of games. But after a couple months the double clicking issue happened to me. It seems to occur every few clicks on my right mouse button. This makes playing FPS unplayable and MMOs frustrating. Avoid this mouse until they improve quality. Such a shame.
1,I used a first gen Naga for many many years. I loved that mouse but decided it was time for an update. I have tried this and a Corsair Scimitar. This is strongly preferred. This should be a five star review. HOWEVER the first Naga Trinity I ordered had a defective keypad. A lot of people have been attributing this to software/many other theories. To those reviewers tinkering with it: A brand new mouse should work without issues! The keypad is defective simply switch it out with a new one and you will find that to absolve your issue. Anyway the second Naga Trinity is outstanding. No issues whatsoever.EDIT: As I said this was my second naga trinity. Within two months I have had issues with both units. The keys on this are extremely cheap. If you use the 12 key pad be warned they quickly wear and lose response. This mouse has lost all responsiveness and is not nearly the same quality of my first gen Naga. Now that I can't return it I wish I had went with another brand like Corsair. I was a fan of razer but sadly I think my first experience with them being as successful as it was was a rare one and their reputation for being cheap is a very legitimate thing.
3,Still getting a feel for this mouse but the middle wheel feels huge and clunky.  Also the icon on the top of the mouse that sits on under the palm of your and gets warm during use  had to use software to turn it off during use
2,I bought this mouse under the impression that the additional buttons had unique values such as "Mouse Button #6 #7 etc" but no additional keys are pre-existing keys they are pre-assigned to the number keys on your keyboard. You can re-asign them through Razer Synapse program (Which is glitchy and half the time won't launch) but you can only re-assign them to keystrokes on your keyboard that already exist.  What's even more frustrating is if you use the only 2 additional button cover it actually has those two buttons assigned as "Additional Mouse button #6 and #7." But you can't have those values on the other 2 adapters.
1,Ive owned 5 different razor mice starting about 10 years ago. 10 years ago I really think Razor made the best mice by a decent margin. However not only is that not true anymore but now Razor is probably one of the worst mice companies on the market.Each new edition gets worse and worse. The first mouse lasted 3 years then 2 then 18 months etc. This newest one I purchased (the one this review is based on) died within 4 weeks (RGB is completely glitched the software freezes whenever I open it the DPI is inconsistent). With Razor you pay premium prices for subpar hardware and software that is unresponsive 50% of the time.Razor lost what would have been a lifetime customer today. I would advise you to look elsewhere for mice. The Ergonomics are great but it doesn't mean anything if the mouse isn't functional.
5,I play ff14 and I love using this mouse for my second hotbar... I also love playing with all of the chroma options and having it match my keyboard/mouse pad <3
5,Really flexible good for any game any amount of mouse buttons u need
1,For an MMO gaming mouse this gets me killed playing MMOs more than anything.  I can't rely on it for something even as simple as clicking.  Holding down the left or right button its 50/50 on whether it actually works.  It causes me to get hit by more mechanics than not because instead of strafing out of danger I just end up standing in place.  A mouse that can't reliably click fails its only real purpose.  I've used other Razer products and even recommended them to friends but not this piece of junk.  Try something else.It's "ergonomic" side buttons cause me more grief than help as well.  They're weirdly shaped; supposedly so you can tell them apart by feel but that's not remotely necessary and it just makes the mouse inferior to the older Nagas and probably other mice in general.Update:  It's only getting worse.  Before the contacts under the left and right buttons would fail now its the side buttons as well.  I can officially not trust ANY of the buttons on this horrible piece of hardware.  It's become more of a hindrance to my gaming than anything and has become utterly infuriating.  Do yourself a favor; buy any mouse OTHER than this one.
3,Very Heavy. Almost unusable for any thing other than an MMO. Maybe I'm just used to my light weight Logitech
5,I love this mouse! The interchangeable sides fit every situation from gaming to a work environment. Very solidly built and can handle me gaming 24/7 on the weekends my only complaint and it's a tiny one is the scroll wheel is super touchy and it sometimes can screw with my gameplay depending on the use of that button in game.
5,great item . Thank you
1,Had an older razor naga of from 2014 and I loved it. It had lasted years until I (regretabbly) gave it to a friend when I stopped playing WoW. I recently came back to WoW for classic and purchased this 2019 naga as my older deathadder was not sufficient for a game like WoW. I should note the death adder I bought in 2016 is of great quality along with the 2014 naga.However this naga is awful. I cannot say that enough. Sure it’s plates are functional and useful but  the mouse is of poor quality. The right AND left click began to fail a little less than 2 MONTHS after it arrived. Please do yourself a favor and heed the other negative reviews and don’t waste $70 on this like I did. From what I’ve read there’s a chance you may get a “good” one but it seems there’s more shoddy ones around. Shoddy is razer’s new MO and this product is nothing like their older products. Don’t be dooped like I was. I have a logitech g600 en route right now as a replacement before my naga completely fails. Check out the g600 if you’re considering an MMO mouse that won’t push (or come close) $100.
5,I have small hands and this mouse fit comfortably in it. Love the interchangeable buttons. Would recommend!
5,I always loved Razer Naga and love it more with 3 different side button options!
3,I just came back to my computer this morning and the mouse is completely dead. I would expect this mouse to outlast any of my old razer mice but here we are going back to my old naga. Extremely disappointed in this mouse.
5,Really like the mouse in general - dpi handling the materials and how you can unattach/attach between options of button sets for different games. Again really high quality material and buttons. Have it for a month and love it.
5,This is a great mouse for the 3 most popular types of ESport FPS MOBA and MMO.  It is a great mouse for a professional or casual gamer.  The 3 extremely interchangeable sides make for easy customization between games.  While the ergonomics aren’t perfect the mouse still has an amazing fit in the hand and is very easy to control.
5,Excellent product for the money. I paired it with the Razer Huntsman Elite and Razer Goliathus Extended Chroma Gaming Mousepad and what a sight it is... Very fast and precise absolutely kills in CPS customizable... What more to wish for?
5,Coming from a Razer Naga epic wasn't much of a change really just added the two other changeable panelsAlthough it does lack wireless capabilities such as my Naga epic it is still a very good gaming mouseThe price is very reasonable compared to the almost $140 I spent on the Razer Naga epic this one cost me a mere $60
2,I've had this mouse only about 2 months when the left button started to multi or misclick causing many issues with use. I'm going through the RMA process with Razer and it's a bit lengthy. I'm going to be without the mouse for a few weeks as they want me to send the old one to them before they send me a replacement. Sad because this was replacing a Naga Hex that I bought back in 2015 that worked well until the middle button switch started going out.
5,Loving it so far after having a regular razer naga for so many years!
2,I have had too many mice to count in my lifetime and I have never had an issue with the most important button on a mouse. The mouse is GREAT for programing macros for gaming and for office use. Worked so good that I bought a second one. No problems with that one.After only 6 months of use the left mouse button works intermittently and it is enough to drive you crazy. Super disappointed about the money spent on this product.
5,Hands down the best gaming mouse out there!!! My son loves this mouse!!!!
4,Great product but be warned:  Razer Synapse 2 does not detect the Trinity and you will have to use Razer Synapse 3 which does not carry over any profiles.  Will have to remake all your profiles from scratch.  Dumb.
4,My son bought this for use with the PS4.  The 12 key function doesn't work well and is very difficult to setup.  Not ideal for use with any system other than PC
3,It's a rather great mouse but the scroll wheel is the worst scroll wheel I've ever used in my life. It does not detect the scroll or it scrolls the opposite way I use it for gaming cause I like the side panel but I use a different mouse and put this one aside if I am doing anything else come on razer.
4,dig the color change options on this and the different side panels. only downside is it is a bit heavy compared to my 2014 naga
1,Within less than a week i started having issue with the 12 button panel not actually working i used the swapping feature and when i would go back to the normal naga layout some of the buttons stopped working i could feel the micro switch in the panel actuate but nothing would happen sometimes if i then squeezed the mouse i would feel the plate fully make contact to the mouse base and maybe the button would fire.It's a shame really I have sworn by Naga's for a long time and love the layout for MMOs especially the sensor is phenomenal and allows for DPI no normal human will even need. The software is also some of the best out there allowing for automatic profile swapping multiple profiles per device ect. at this point it's the main reason i am not jumping ship to a different mouse immediately.I've not decided if I will be trying to return this as defective send it to Razer under warranty or what... they no longer sell the proper naga without the side panels. I am concerned that any replacement will also run into this issue as it seems like it may well be a design flaw or due to extremely lax build tolerances.
1,The mouse arrived in its original packaging and seals. However when I opened it it no longer looked like a "new" item. It seems to have been a refurbished mouse or there was a manufacturer mistake. There were was no manual with this item there was a missing interchangeable side plate and I received the WRONG MOUSE!  I have asked for a replacement and I will wait for the next one to show up which I hope is correct. dDepending on the results of the next delivery I will change the rating. I know this rating has nothing to do with the mouse its self and it has more to do with Amazon.
5,Favorite mouse would rebuy if I ever needed to.
1,I've had it for only a week and it randomly clicks for no reason. My previous mouse was the Naga Hex V2 so I'm very familiar with this format. This vendor is bad.
1,the rubber grip that is on the scroll wheel has come loose and it is now very annoying to try and use the scroll wheel every time i buy a razer mouse it just seems to break in a very inconvenient way. i do not recommend any razer product they break easily
5,I play moba as well as fps games and the ability to switch out the amount of side buttons has been amazing. This mouse has been well worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone that plays PC games.
4,Great mouse for the price could be a little more stout in construction but still great!
2,The mouse is great in every way from the options to change things and the interchangeable side parts. But the mousewheel. The mousewheel is sluggish in its movement and not very good. I like to game but I rarely game currently and the mousewheel has not seen the amount of use time to act up. so im just gunna say its a design flaw. Its not worth it but im just gunna stick with it because its my only mouse and its "good enough" to just say screw it and not have to wait.
3,Left mouse button started to double/triple click on its own about 2 months after purchase. Turns out to be a common problem with Razer mice due to faulty switches. Garbage QA process. So many people online with similar issues with these buttons. I can RMA but will be without a mouse during that time.
5,This is a great mouse I love the fact that I have switchable sides for programmed keys. I use 12 button one for when I am working on my CAD program. I use the two button one for my shooter games on my PC and I use the ring for all my other games
2,The mouse will miss clicks and buttons "stick" due to issues with the drivers and Synapse 3.0. I am pretty much done with Razer products which has turned out to be good since they are double the price of competitors for no reason.
2,I've had 4 of these mouses now total. 3 of them have given me issues with the left click after a few months.Gave it two stars because while it was working it worked great. And gave one extra star because Razer has replaced all three at no cost to me.I just can't get over the fact that 3 mice have had the same problem. I ended up switching to a red dragon mouse with the thumb buttons and have been using that for half a year with no issues. I keep the 4th naga I got as a backup now.
2,Naga Epic was much more form fitting than the newer Trinity. The Trinity almost slips from my grasp when gaming as the material is too smooth and the ergonomics do not contour to my hand. Also why have 3 button configuration and remove the swap-able grip. You'd think if you add the changeable hotkey design you wouldn't remove an important feature of the Naga.Even though it is an older model I would recommend the Epic over the Trinity if you can find one because the design allowed you to customize the grip. Hot swapping keys I imagine after the first day or two won't seem as important as being able to have a grip that fits your hand.
1,Only a year old but had the issue since day one the side buttons will randomly stop working. Only fix is to close synapse and re-open it. My old razer naga epic (discontinued but can pay a premium for one) lasted me 5 years this new mouse is garbage.
5,I can't even imagine gaming without the side number buttons- Love it!
5,Was everything I expected! Love it and it works great for my video games!
1,I can't believe this company continues to sell these broken mice when they know they have such a widespread issue. The mouse will sometimes refuse to register a click or register it twice or release the click while you're trying to click and drag. Sometimes when click and dragging it will just spam click.I began having these issues within a couple weeks of purchase but it was infrequent at the start and I brushed it off. But it's to the point now after about 2 months where it's almost constant and makes using this a nightmare.Razer support says they will ship me a new one after they receive this one shipped back so I guess in the meantime I just won't be able to do my job or play games with friends? And then MAYBE I'll get a mouse that works?Terrible product worse customer support. Will not be wasting my time with a replacement and buying a mouse from another brand.
1,First off -- I'm a software development professional for 30 years and know what I'm claiming here to be true:When I bought this unit I got automated driver and software updates whether I wanted them or not regularly for a while -- often 1-2 times a week. The drivers sometimes failed to function found many bugs in the color programming interface and required me to uninstall razer software to avoid being forced to log in every bootup before I could use my computer. Unacceptable. Then it just died after around 6 months. This is not my first razer disaster. After having to literally throw out my ripsaw because it never worked for me after 6 months of attempted and ultimately useless tech support/4 replacements with identical results I chucked it.
2,On the first one of these the left mouse button was accidentally caught by the wire of my headphones and got dislodged from its nest and was bent SUPER easily. The cheapest plastic material I have seen.The second one I got it got the double clicking issue after a few months. I cannot recommend these. The programmable features are nice as is the ability to change between the various layouts but I will not buy any more of these. First Razer product I am genuinely disappointed in.
1,This mouse is way too heavy and bulky and I have big hands. It is hard to hit the side buttons. Also the software is so buggy and inconsistent sometimes the rgb wants to work and other times won't turn on. Also it's still using micro usb instead of standard usb c inexcusable for a $149 mouse.
5,Great for gaming. I use the 7 circle option. Works great for me cause i can still grip the mouse good in the center of the circle but also get all the extra buttons compared to a 2 side button mouse
3,Came with a click malfunction. Razer was accommodating with return/replacement service. Upgrading rating
2,I read reviews cautioning me that the trinity is not like the older better quality versions of the naga. I did not listen. I am now here to report that I can confirm the new trinity will not hold up like your 2009 naga did. My trinity lasted a year. I've spent the last few months using canned air to "quick fix" my left click from completely failing.  I decided to throw in the towel when I couldn't highlight a paragraph on a word document because the left click is entirely broken at this point.However while it worked I was very happy with it. But this is not the razer naga I grew up with.
1,Do not buy this mouse or any Razer products. I have bought this same mouse TWICE and both times the buttons failed in less than 3 months. First the Mouse 2 button then the 1-9 mmo buttons started to become unresponsive. This mouse is no where near worth the cost of it. This cheap Chinese made piece of crap should be worth less than $15. Go find a better product. Don't waste your money on this cheap plastic thats bound to fail.
5,Feels good on the hands very lightweight had to get used to it after my last mouse with the steel plate on the bottom. The side panels that snap on and off feel flimsy but are holding up fine.Overall I am very happy with this mouse.
1,So basically  the mice suddenly stoped working after 3.5 months. I would plug-in the device and it will only get recognized by the pc for 5 seconds and then It would stop working even tho the RGB still on but with a “buggy” flashy lights.Contacted amazon and they said that they only refund 80% of the product then contacted razer and they told me I had a default unit but they won’t pay for the shipment cost of the product even tho it lasted 3.5 months. I already bought 3 racer naga mices and they all broke fairly quick but I never switched because I didn’t knew other brand that had a similar product. Now I’ll switch to corsair scmitiar at least they have a decent RMA.
3,I bought this in march of last year. It hasn't been used a whole lot since and never misused. It's already acting up where it will double click when you only press it ounce. It's quite an annoyance. Expected it to last longer. Will be finding a different brand for my next.
1,Mouse worked find for the first 6 months but then the buttons started sticking. Less than a year in and it's impossible to hold the mouse button to do basic highlighting and selecting of text and other things.Figured it's just a bad micro switch on this version so I contact support and include all the details and questions the first go. The customer support ignores what I wrote and asks for all the info again asks for a invoice (one I already provided) and WANTS A VIDEO OF MY DESKTOP? The video is just there to scare people away from using the warranty. Unless this is resolved in a proper and honest manner I am never buying razer again. Not worth dealing their scumbag and dishonest tactics.
5,Really great mouse for the price. The programmable keys help me quickly change ammo and keys in the game. Also this come with great side keys that help me play shooters and complicated games like Eve Online.
5,Great product
2,I do not suggest this mouse at all. It was a great mouse for 1 year. After that the double clicking started and if you are a game it is going to cause major issues. I stopped gaming after I got it but it still troubles me in simple tasks for work. It is unbelievable how bad and unpredictable the clicking issue is. I went to my local micro center and picked up a $1 mouse that is now out performing the Naga. Just a huge disappointment.
2,Mouse wheel is loose and shakes almost like a plastic piece is broken. It jiggles back and forth not quality and is super annoying while gaming. I’ve had Razer brand mouses in the past that don’t have this problem. Would not recommend
3,I'm not sure if the right-click on my mouse is overly sensitive or if the added flare from the design is causing my ring finger to press against it but I end up with accidental clicks constantly. Overall the mouse feels awkward to hold. On my Win10 setup the software is constantly crashing too causing the RGB to randomly change colors and then return to my original setting.
5,Does exactly what I bought it for- gaming.
4,It's a great mouse i use it for Division 2 and WOW and alternate between the 6 button and 12 button attachments .
2,I really liked this mouse and its features but sadly it's starting to double click constantly after 4 months. I've seen quite a few posts on reddit with people having the same issue. A "gaming" mouse going bad after 4 months is ridiculous. I also didn't like the synapse software that you have to use with it though very buggy software. So yea I even bought the extra asurion warranty protection but they won't do anything because the mouse is still under warranty. I've messaged Razer and no reply yet after almost 2 weeks. I think I'm just gonna go back to buying cheap mice and just buy another when they go bad rather than having to wait around on customer service.
4,Connection for the interchangeable buttons could be stronger
5,Love the functionality and the extra buttons.  If you have a small hand it will seem to large and difficult to use any of the side buttons beyond the first horizontal row.
5,My husband purchased this mouse for gaming. He loves having the ability to change the side plates to give him more or less buttons depending on his current need. He hasn't had this current mouse very long but his previous mouse was the same brand and he had it for many many years! Great quality.
1,It's sad there's really only one option and it's stuck with the mechanical switches. Like others mine has failed after ~2 years.
5,A really solid gaming mouse! I like having the variability with the side buttons. It works well for games like overwatch and Dota2 and also holds up great for a school projects or daily use. Overall great product!
1,Had this for 3 months and it stopped working won't charge won't light up won't say its plugged into the laptop and Amazon doesn't want to do anything about neither does razer this mouse is too expensive to be broken already.
5,I originally bought this mouse for a friend of mine as a gift but seeing the performance and smooth handle of this mouse along with the game specific button layout you can setup urged me to buy this. A fantastic purchase if I do say so myself!
5,Personally I have had good luck with my Razer items.  This one is no exception - its great.  The side pannels connect magnetically though I doubt I will use anything other than the 12 button much.  The size is nice the 12 buttons are larger and easier to hit the high digits. Really happy with this mouse.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Pros:*Multiple Additional left pieces to fit any playstyle*DPI is adjustable*braided cable*good fit for large hands*weighty but not heavyCons:*left and right clickers are not durableThis gaming mouse is NOT worth the asking price due to its poor internal components. I have had this mouse for 1.5 years and rarely used it for an extended period and around the 1.2 year mark the left click began to malfunction. It would only click and hold on certain spots on the mouse. At this time I've contacted both Amazon and Razer to see if the item was under warranty or to repair the item in which both declined. From that point I've been making due with the mouse only for the right click to also malfunction. As of now the mouse is borderline impossible to work or play games with. After doing research I should have done even buying the mouse I've found that this issue is not uncommon by any means.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND INVESTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY INTO ANOTHER COMPETITIVE PRODUCT.
5,Love this mouse it was a good price and it works great. Does take time to get used to it but other than that i love it!
2,I love the interchangeable side buttons. I'm not used to a huge amount of buttons and usually only need three or so anyway so I change out the side buttons as needed. I bought the mouse used and was getting the double clicking problem immediately I just didn't realize it. I thought I was messing up myself. I managed to fix it with the breath technique I read about but now it's come back worse than ever and nothing will fix it. As I click and drag a lot for work the mouse is unusable. It's such a good mouse it's a shame I can't use it.
2,I’m going back to it. This newer model feels like such a downgrade. While the swappable macros offer some nice options for different games/ applications they are not very responsive to rapid inputs and scrapping the swappable grips was a big bummer too. You really do have to wait a moment before the macro registers.The clickers are very mushy compared to the older model as well not always registering my (admittedly faster than usual) double clicks.If you’re looking for a macro keyed mouse for gaming go elsewhere.
5,This is my second Naga mouse (the first one was the original Naga). Plate's easy to swap out and sturdy on the mouse Chroma lighting is pleasant to look at and the sensitivity's easy to adjust. If you're looking for a mouse for gaming or for just every day use this is the one
5,Amazing mouse with a versatile capabilities.
1,These things are nowhere near as reliable as the old 2012/2014 series...Mine arrived pressing random keys with any of the plates plugged in and with no plate plugged in using the latest software with no other razer software except synapse 3.0 I tried troubleshooting for days. My only conclusion is that they sent me a faulty product. I would be very paranoid when buying this mouse. If you get a non faulty one it is only a matter of time before it messes up.Update 11/5/2020: Garbage product is still garbage my replacement from amazon also began to double click and press random keys they refused to replace it again this time because it has been 6 months since I got it. Same issue as the last mouse double clicking left and right click random key presses. These products are cheaply made and do not deserve your money. Buy a 30$ mmo mouse buy a corsair or something that wont hurt your wallet as bad because I'm 3/3 trinity's that dont work through no fault of my own. Last time I give this company a chance.
2,I’ve had this product now for about 3 weeks and the first few days were great but since then I’ve been having issues with double clicking the left clicker keeps getting stuck and the wheel scroller keeps getting stuck. This was my first Razer product recommended by people I pvp with and I am very disappointed. I would really like to give Razer another chance but how it turned out with this product I’m not too sure I want to deal with that headache again.
3,This mouse is great it feels good in my hand and it’s versatile. But in actual use I find the ring finger divot to be a nuisance and I find myself clawing my hands to use it efficiently for LoL or SC2. Besides that it responds really well.
4,Haven't found a dislike about this mouse yet
5,Comfortable and quick response. Best mouse for gaming MMORPG.
1,Worked fine at first was disappointed by the removal of the second button on top of the mouse but whatever. Noticed the mouse would start to hang every now and then gradually got worse. Now it just doesn't respond at all to clicks or movement. A known good Razor is working fine. Tried multiple USB ports checked drivers nothing worked. Tried it on a different PC same issue dead mouse. Support has given me the run around so far.Garbage like most of their new products. I know it's a hard habit to break because they really are the most comfortable gaming mice but at this point it's just poor quality and not worth dishing out the money on anymore especially when support can't be assed to acknowledge there is an issue.
4,Tried this out because I needed a new naga the plates are okay but it isn't my personal preference. I would still with singular models unless you have a need for all of these button layouts!
3,I bought this mouse a little over a month ago. Just recently I began having issues where the cursor would get “stuck” and not move unless and move the mouse around a lot. I got a better mousepad I’ve cleaned the area and mouse and it still happening from time to time....
1,-If you have large to Medium hands then this mouse is not for you. The 12 and 6 buttons are so close you will constantly be hitting other buttons.-The Software they use is not good. It constantly wants you to give up your information and create a account. Why would I do this for a mouse.-It has onboard memory that it constantly forgets it's programing. Making this a Mediocre wireless mouse at best.Update: It now Randomly stops working. THIS MOUSE IS GARBAGE!
5,This mouse is amazing for pro Photoshop and Lightroom editing. The design is perfect! I love being able to assign keystrokes to the many mouse buttons. The resolution is very high for fine detail work and the overall build quality is excellent.
1,I used a 1st gen Razer Naga for about 4-5 years back when they came out. It's the reason why I'm only interested in other mice with 12 buttons on the side because the convenience is unmatched. The new Razer products however are no longer worthy of the Razer price tags. In fact Razer products have a HUGE failure rate and from what I've read do not provide good customer service regarding warranties or taking responsibility for their garbage products. I took the chance anyway on the new Naga Trinity because the idea of it is so cool. I haven't had it a month and it already has had moments of double clicking while performing a single left click and also while holding down the right mouse button to zoom in the scope in-game it will zoom out real quick and then back i1n but I was holding the right mouse button down the whole time. It really is a shame what Razer has turned into. I've only had this new Naga Trinity for about 3 weeks. I'm done. I'm trying the G600 now which has a terrible feeling scroll wheel click and a loud left click but I suppose that is minor compared to Razer issues.
5,Son loves his new mouse
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Got this mouse for my husbands gaming he loved it and it worked well! The problem is got this in November and by mid january the LMB(left mouse button) stopped being as responsive and now by march the issue still happens off and on and the leds for the mouse are freaking out flashing off and on. So now 4 months later Im already going to need to find and buy a new mouse. Like I said it really was a good mouse he liked it and was happy with it but now with it not working maybe we got a bad one.
5,It’s a great mouse I ordered it for a rpg/mmo game and it turns out it’s really useful for really any game like shooters it’s nice to have the extra buttons
5,The shape is not for everyone and may take a bit to get use to. I have used several different ones and this is all ways my go to. Give it a shot.
1,I've had 5 Razer Naga mice since 2012 and only the first one survived 2 years. I've used other mice- Corsair Ironclaw and M65 among others- and although I like the Naga's shape best I cannot recommend it at all.- The Razer software is bad. Disregarding the UI and macro capabilities the software often causes issues with games like Overwatch on my high end systems.- The RGB lighting and DPI profile does not function when the computer is starting up or waking from sleep due to Synapse 3. I was not able to get Synapse 2 to work with this mouse.- The  mouse lags when Synapse is starting or under strain (i.e. opening other games).- Razer technical support is highly unhelpful asks for full access of your computer to provide support services. They will get you to uninstall almost everything down to Windows itself before offering replacement.- The wheel quality of my newest Trinity is a large step down from previous iterations even after breaking it in. It sticks and squeaks unlike any other mouse I've seen.I would like to like the mouse but it has so many issues that make it frustrating to use.
4,It's a solid mouse so far I have yet to use the other attachments yet only the moba one but when I try the other's I'll update this if I remember.
5,My boyfriend has been using this same gaming mouse for years. Finally the one he had was not working as it should his did get a lot of usage. We are loving the new changing colors and he like the 3 changeable options it came with for the button on the left.
5,Best MMO gaming mouse on the market.
4,Probably not good for lefties. Otherwise it’s a great MMO mouse. Used it when I was addicted to WoW during BC. Made my gaming easier. Heavier than I remembered. Pricey
2,If you have small hands this mouse is not for you.  It is very awkward and hard to use.
5,I have personally always purchased razer products seeking the top of the line. This product is no exception built in driver software download makes this mouse easy and ready to plug and play upon opening.
2,After years of using a g600 I thought it was time to get an upgrade the naga trinity looked great to be honest so I gave it a try.All I can say is while it worked it was fine it does what it's supposed to. But I honestly put in question the quality of razr products the right click stopped working properly not even 6 months into having it for an $80 mouse it's just unacceptable yeah it has nice feature and the interchangeable plates what good is all that if the mouse itself is crap.  I'm honestly not buying razr again it's just low quality products with pretty aesthetics.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought the Naga Trinity not the Pro and have been using it for a week now. Everything else is okay except for the mouse3/scroll click button which won't always work when I click it. It's so unreliable. 😩Check the video I uploaded I've set the lighting to reactive to show how the mid button clicks aren't registering. Hope it helps give you an idea about the issue I'm having right now.I hope the seller can do something about this. It's weird to have this issue this early.**UPDATE 01/30**It just got worse. Now aside from the mid-mouse button not registering from time to time it now has the double-click issue on the same button while the LMB has started to become stiff which probably means it's on its way to getting the same issue.Wow. I've only used this for less than a month and it's like this already. People should just stop buying this. Actually Amazon should just keep this product off their website. It's dogshit.
5,Top notch gaming mouse have been using for months now.
5,the truth that this mouse I liked a lot because in my pc I have both MOBA games and shooters and this mouse with its interchangeable plates can be adapted to all the games even to surf the internet. There is not much to say about chroma lights just that they are very good and highly configurable
1,So I had this for about 2 months when my issue with it started. The issue was that the left click would sometimes not register. It's pretty annoying especially when you're mid raid and need to heal someone or swap equipment or drag and drop something in game. I also recently started having an issue where the mouse would detect a different plate than the one you have installed. Sometimes it won't detect it at all. I gotta say I've been very disappointed with Razer lately. Since I doing lighter gaming sessions this season I haven't had the need to purchase a new mouse but when I do I'll probably go Logitech or Corsair instead of Razer.
2,I am having the same double clicking issue. I'm giving the product 2 stars instead of 1 because mine did work reliably and properly for most of the 2 year warranty period. I wish I would reached out to Razer when it first started to happen while it was still under warranty. Great Mouse for as long as it works.
1,Got this Razer mouse to go with my Razer laptop which has a webcam that never worked and which Razer refused to fix. Now I have a mouse that's lost all its settings and macros because you risk losing everything in their software which requires you to login to use your own mouse or to create your macros and settings as a "guest" on your own computer. I used the "guest" setting and for reasons wholly beyond me my saved settings have totally disappeared. This represents a shocking amount of work that has to be redone. The software that comes with this mouse is buggy garbage that requires a login. And for the price that's particularly unacceptable. I've sunk enough money into Razer trash and I won't make the mistake again.
2,Everything seems to work flawlessly up to this point (1 1/2 months as of writing this review) with the exception of the scrolling wheel. When I scroll up there's not really much of an issue but scrolling down is terrible! It seems to almost get stuck so you need to apply more pressure to get the scroll back then you end up clicking down on the wheel. This is not good for any gaming at all as you normally have all sorts of keybinds to this mouse including down click etc. I've had a replacement one with the same issue. Now contacting Razer customer support to see if there's a fix or possibly a refund. Wish the scrolling wheel was like my other Razer mouse cuz then it'd be a perfect fit!
1,i needed a second mouse for my work computer. i liked the idea of having all of the additional buttons and i enjoyed the mouse when it worked. although Recently spilled a small amount of water that pooled up around my mouse. it is now completely useless. my other mouse has survived this same exact circumstance multiple times over the last year or two I had it with no issues. If this product can’t survive a small bit of water then it has no place on a desk especially for its price. all around ive been a bit disappointed in razer products as ive had issues with another product of there’s . ill be passing on this company from now on
1,The mouse keeps disconnecting from the Razor program and no matter what I do the mouse just doesn't connect to the PC. I suggest just getting a cheaper mouse that doesn't use a program to run.
1,When my 10+ year old Razer Naga finally wore out I really only looked at Razer's latest offerings when shopping for a replacement. That was a mistake. This Trinity looked wonderful out of the box the buttons felt great but... almost immediately it goes into fits on USB connect/disconnects. My old Naga never did this. No other mouse I have does this. And this mouse seems to work fine *if* you don't install the new Razer Control Center/Synapse software (but then you have a $70 mouse that you can't program).I've read dozens of complaints of this behavior dating back 2 years or more. I've tried the recommended solutions (disabling various USB power-saving options) but the problem continues. I've tried multiple USB3 ports I've tried multiple machines. At random intervals it just goes into fits of USB disconnects/re-connects.
1,The mouse overall feels really good in your hand but its meant to be a gaming mouse. They give you interchangeable sides to match up with what style of game you'd be playing to scale how many mouse buttons are available to you. But the way it is designed makes it unplayable in games that require timing. The side panel that houses the buttons can shift ever so slightly and it makes the buttons literally unusable until you hard press to get the housing to fall back into place properly. As an avid MMO player how enjoys PvP mechanics this makes this mouse literally useless because a half second time difference or believing you're hitting a button but in reality you're not just isnt fun. The mouse killed my gaming experience multiple nights in a row before it ended up smashed to bits in the corner of the room...
5,If you're playing an mmo or a game with a lot of different skills/abilities this is the mouse for you. The different side attachments that this mouse comes with are also good and easy to switch. Accuracy and feel wise I still enjoy the proteus g502.
2,I used to use a naga all the time I used it for FPS MMO normal computing it's a great mouse. But after using the deathadder for a while on FPS games popping that plate on it doesn't just make it magically a FPS-friendly mouse.The form of it is great for MMOs very ergonomic for long grinds but the overall ergonomics just feel funny with the 2 button plate for an FPS where flicks and continued high precision tracking are expected.I now have both mice sitting on my desk and I'm just swapping between them depending on the game. Kind of sad since the 3-plate design should have replaced that.
5,Great feel and design. The interchangeable thumb buttons are great. Swap out quickly. I can’t say a bad thing about this mouse. Use it primarily for gaming but doesn’t disappoint for everyday use.
4,Good quality just a little bit small.
1,Do not buy razer products they have a very high failure rate and the company does not stand behind its products
5,I liked the six button design better but the 7 button is alright. The build quality is great but the software can be a complete pain to get to work sometimes.
3,Mine was broken. So I got a refund from amazon. I had to get a new one from a retail shop. It looks cool and all but even for MMORPG games it's really not useful. I mean it's not even satisfying to hold it
5,I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loved it it works perfectly and there’s not really much difference between the Bluetooth and the corded version
5,BF absolutely loved it for gaming!!
5,Excelente mouse ergonómico y muy preciso
4,its okay. nothing to rave about..
2,Have had an issue with it double clicking my left mouse intermittently for a few weeks dealing with their support is a nightmare and the only solution is to mail my only mouse in for weeks for them to inspect it and tell me if its damaged and decide to actually send a replacement or my same mouse. If I wanted to buy a second mouse I would have just purchased two cheap ones instead of Razer
3,Random freezing multiple times per hour over the 2.4ghz.  Moved the USB receiver to front of PC and it seems to be working better.
1,While the mouse does in fact work as a mouse on a Mac you cannot make any customizations to lighting record and save macros or map buttons. Razer has abandon software updates for MacOS.There is no MacOS version of Synapse 3 so any device requiring it cannot be customized.You can use Synapse 2 as long as you have not upgraded to 10.15 (Catalina) or newer but newer devices still won't work.
1,Its a shame because I love the mouse I'm used to the way it feels and when it does work (which is for about 3 months every time) it works well. But I purchased this mouse 1 year ago have been having problems last few months put it off as I have not been gaming as much lately. The same problem I have had with my last 2 mice which were Razer Naga's is now happening again. Mouse clicks/holds are unpredictable causing it to be very frustrating and unenjoyable to play games. Decided this time hey I will try to send it in see if they would fix it instead of just buying a new one impatiently but no I cannot because the 2 year limited warranty they speak of is no longer in effect for this mouse. My dissapointment is immeasurable and I will never buy another Razer product again.
2,Thought i bought the best mouse i have ever used. Less than six months after purchase the side button attachments started to fail constantly.  Middle of my mmo and the buttons just stopped working.  I tried everything the internet had to offer to fix this problem.  Just getting tired of spending more time trying to get the buttons working than playing games.  No more Razor mice for me.
5,For PC gaming
5,Great mouse for gaming and work very easy to use love it.
1,So my Razer Naga that I had for around 12 years finally died. I loved it and saw this Naga Trinity and thought that having the switching side panels would be a great feature. Yeah.. no. Got it installed Synapse 3 fired up Raft and .. no dice. The 12 button keypad didn't interact with the program's hotbar. Tried everything from restoring factory defaults trying different USB ports restarting the computer deleting and re-installing drivers. Nothing.  Tried it with other games with in-game 12 button hotbars and still had no luck getting the mouse's thumb pad to work. Then I looked at the community forums on Razer support and saw a number of issues with the Naga Trinity. I've had this about 24 hours and I am returning it and going with a different brand all together. Apparently Razer Nagas are not as well made as they used to be which is a shame.
5,Razwr is the only mouse I will likely every use. I especially like how this one can be changed to suit your gaming needs.
4,I really like this mouse best series of mice you can get. I recommend buying a naga
1,Compre dos mouse Razer Trinity y ambos iniciaron a fallar a los 3 meses problemas con doble click.Inicie el proceso de garantía directamente con Razer y su respuesta fue que ellos podían reemplazar el producto pero como vivo en un paisa en el cual ellos no tienen warehouse entonces debía enviarle el producto a un conocido en algún paisa en el cual ellos si tengan el warehouse y que entonces si podían cambiar el producto adicional yo debía correr con el 100% de los costos de esos envíos.Solo Brasil tiene warehouse en Latinoamérica y esto hace que la garantia de los productos Razen en otros paises latinoamericanos no aplique realmente si tenemos que correr con los gastos de envió y recepción es mas barato comprar un nuevo producto.
1,I've owned alot of mmo mice in my time as a gamer and the latest version of razers naga mouse is by far the worst I've owned. If you do any serious amount of gaming do not get this. In less than 5 months my left AND right mouse button started double clicking and feel soft. Also you know how this mouse has the removable side panel where you can put on different buttons? If that panel moves SLIGHTLY at all while you're playing the entire mouse stops working. There's nothing more frustrating than trying to play a game and in the middle of an intense moment having your mouse just stop doing anything.The mouse has just a cheap build quality. Go with Logtiechs G600 or the Corsair scimitar. For the price this mouse is not worth it at all.
1,My wife and i are huge fan of the original razor naga.  My wife and i use it for years.  So when it came time to buy a new ones.  For us it was a no brainer.  Sadly. The quality just doesn't seem like it was put into the newest generation of these mouse's.  The Lasor on ours stopped working about 3 months into having it.  We later ran into an issue on the software side.  The Chroma DLLs that install with synapsis.  Started to interfere with other programs ability to run and ended up having to do a total hard drive wipe to get get all of it off the computer and the computer running right.  Not sure what the deal was their but sadly we will not be trying razor mice again for a good bit of time.
5,Great product
5,This is a good mouse. The side panel is super easy to change out and I very much recommend. I use it for WoW and it puts all the control in one hand.
2,When putting on the 12-key side panel the 1-12 buttons sometimes wouldn't work at random. I re-attached the 12 key side panel multiple times. Across those multiple times sometimes the 1 didn't work sometimes 1470 didn't work and sometimes other strange combinations of keys didn't work.I'm not an electrical engineer but my immediate guess is that their magnetic connectors are faulty or their software is faulty. My experience with the latest version of Synapse at this time (ver. 3.3.1128.112711) has been fine in every other regard. My Black Widow Ultimate has had no issues with their software.If you play any kind of game that requires 100% reliability from the mouse (most games especially MMOs where you're participating in competitive or extreme difficulty content) this is NOT the mouse for you. Get a better mouse that's not trying to be everything.
2,I purchased this mouse May 10 2018 after my original Razer Naga stopped registering mouse movement after 4 years. 4 years is a solid lifetime for a mouse in my opinion. This mouse seemed to have the same promise and it worked great until a couple weeks ago when the left click started acting up. When I hold down the left click it does not register. This is very problematic for gaming and normal computer use. Razer has a 2 year warranty on their mice but suggests contacting the seller (which in my case is Amazon) for the mouse to be replaced. Unfortunately I haven't found a way to get a replacement through Amazon which has led me to leaving this review. It's a shame what seemed to be a great product has turned into a poor investment of $100.
5,This thing is amazing for any needs great for bigger handed people. All three features make it perfect for any game.
1,I wasn't sure if I did something wrong or not but looking at the other reviews here I can safely say this product has a major design flaw. I too am getting the dreaded double click/can't hold mouse down issue. It's a shame because I have only had this mouse since August 2020 and it's already failing on me. Most of my work is based around dragging nodes around and it's become extremely frustrating. Can't even click and drag files around in my OS anymore. I've lost files that were just dumped into a random folder thanks to the mouse button being busted.The interchangable buttons is a neat concept and I liked it a lot but I can't recommend this with all of the reviews echoing the same failures.
2,I'll preface this with the fact that since my mouse died in 1 month i was able to exchange it for a new one that I'm waiting on now.  It is totally possible that my mouse was just a lemon and that the next one will hold up great .As more of a review of the mouse I will say that it has taken me a while to get use to the side button placement.  I find the 2 button side panel to have the buttons very high up on the side of the mouse making it difficult to press them with my thumb.  I have the similar issues with some of the buttons on the other panels but those ones have more buttons lower on the side of the mouse that are more comfortable to reach.
5,Great product awesome for gaming
5,love
5,Have to get used to the textured side on the pinky the previous Naga was flat. Other than that works well.
5,It is a light mouse but with many options for button layouts. It is very responsive and is worth the money regardless of switching layouts.
3,Left click failing after less than a year side attachments take multiple tries to connect correctly essentially I got the 12 button side working and left it at that.
5,as much as I like having the wireless version I noticed after having it for 6 months that it just was not holding a charge. Purchased this to replace. If you are someone who needs a lot key bindings for things like raiding this is the go to mouse.
5,Bought this mouse for myself to play games and surprised my boyfriend with one. We both love them! Great response time and feels great in your hand
5,Really great mouse. Have amazing versatility. If you have really big hands it might be too small for you.
5,Great mmo mouse best quality.
5,Best mouse
5,I’ve owned the Razer Naga Trinity mouse for over a year. It moves very smoothly has a comfortable and ergonomic design and the changing light colors makes it visually appealing. Highly recommend it.
1,I have been using razer naga since they first came out.  I am a long time mmo player and play several hours a day.  My 2014 naga finally died..and I come to this mouse with its three plug in pannels...I won't comment on two of them..I don't use them...the 12 button panel is what I use.With in a month the number 4 button would stop working...I would have to unplug the mouse to get it to work (just removing the side panel did not fix). So after another week of 4 dying the left click would double click.  I really like the feel of razer mice and thought maybe I got a defective one.I order a new one...45 days later the number 10 button would get stuck on repeating infinitely until I unplugged the mouse from my machine.  The side panel being removed would not fix.I can't recommend this mouse...I'm now using other company's mice because apparently this one is a peice of junk
5,I simply need the numpad on the mouse for gaming and the other faceplates are a bonus. Easy to switch to whichever fits your needs most. The mouse is lighter than my old naga since it lacks a battery however it isn't difficult to adjust to. Does exactly what i need it to and more if necessary.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have always bought razer products. However buying this mouse has been the biggest mistake of my life. I have started having the double clicking problem just 7-8 months after purchasing a $100+ mouse. I dont live in US and had bought it while I was there on holiday. I live in Dubai. I contacted the razer team and they were the most unhelpful customer support I have ever seen. Initially they said they couldn't help me and I should contact the reseller that I bought it from. After explaining that I bought it from Amazon US and showing them the above video of the mouse malfunctioning they told me to return the mouse to them at my own cost. It is costing me more to send them the mouse back than the value of the mouse itself. Worst part of this is that its not the first razer mouse I have bought. I have bought 2 previous hexes which have both developed the same issue after about a year of usage.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER RAZER PRODUCT AND I URGE EVERYONE READING THIS REVIEW TO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY. PLEASE CONSIDER ANOTHER BRAND.
5,it fits perfectly in my hand. the option to change the side key is awsome i love it
1,The only thing I like about it is that it doesn't feel cheap.Way too many misclicksThe buttons on the side are actually horrendous. The original layout they had was phenomenal.The little notches they had on the middle buttons on the old ones that would help you find your "center" were great.That feature is gone now. Along with a layout of buttons that seems absolutely ridiculous. They seem crammed. The different height angles are irritating.I've had the Naga Epic for many years and this new iteration is personally a letdown. A redesign of the shell was unnecessary. The side bulge on the right doesn't feel comfortable. I'm returning it and finding a new MMO mouse.The only things I like are the new optical sensor and the skate design on the bottom.If you really like the old models this model is not for you.
4,It's a razer mouse
5,For the last 15 years ive used a logitech trackball on my gaming PC. Now with this mouse im starting off using the the side panel with 7 buttons until i get use to using that. Im really happy with the mouse. :)
5,Great mouse but be wary if you have smaller hands because the "palm" end of this mouse is bulky.
5,3 ways to connect to computer...Bluetooth...2.4 gig and cable
2,While I enjoy the feel of the mouse and the button orientation the double click issue with the left and right mouse buttons has made this mouse unusable. I purchased the mouse in anticipation of the return of World of Warcraft Classic and it has had the problem since the start. Upon research there are many people that have had this same issue with their mouse many of whom either resort to pulling the mouse apart and applying contact cleaner or lubricant to the buttons to downloading a script to ignore multiple mouse click inputs that happen in very short time spans which then doesn't allow click and hold. Time to find another MMO gaming mouse.
5,Love this mouse. Makes gaming so much better.
5,This mouse works perfect for my mmo gaming needs. The faceplate with the numbers in a circle is perfect for key binds and it allows you to grab the mouse to pick it up because the middle of the circle is a rubber pad.
1,Its been many years since I have owned a Razer product and sadly this one fell to the wayside just like the others. I bought the mouse back in June with trepidation and for a short while was pleasantly surprised until a few weeks ago games started not acting right or links were opening double windows after trying to click once. After doing some research found out this is a very well known issue with these mice and  the only way to fix them is to take them apart to replace the hardware that controls the clicker. I am sadly outside of the range for amazon return and am currently trying to get into contact with Razer support to see what can be done. I will hold my breath for a little while before putting Razer with the likes of other over priced hardware that's not worth the money nor hassle
1,Right click is wearing out as per the title.  It is advertised as an MMO mouse and in MMO's right click gets used a LOT to control camera or steer character.  In my case it clicks fine down but it randomly disconnects.In the game I am playing you click and hold to aim(other games it's hold to charge) then let loose to fire.As you can imagine a click that releases itself randomly leads to a LOT of wasted shots.Also the paint is wearing off the radial thumb buttons already.I should have listened to my better instincts and let Razors long standing poor reputation warn me off.
5,Great quality and feel love this mouse love Razer products
5,Great mouse wish the 9 and 12 button modes could be programed and not just linked to numbers but it's still an amazing mouse
5,Great for programming
5,My favourite mouse. Got it on sale so the price was great. Comfortable and customizable. Unlike other designs I used Naga keypad is quite intuitive and easy to use.
5,Very cool many colors many mapping abilities
4,1 star off because this thing gets really hot sometimes!
5,I love Razer and almost my whole setup is Razer with my blackwidow keyboard and I had the naga hex for 2 years. I upgraded to this mouse and it's nothing but an improvement much cheaper than other places and of course it came super fast! very happy
5,I bought this mouse to play an MMORPG and it functions very well. The modular buttons give a lot of options for different games and macro sets and the synapse software lets me setup different chroma templates.
5,A little bigger than the original Naga I recently upgraded from but overall the same great product!
4,Decent for the price
3,Just got this mouse and it is clicking multiple times if you hold the left mouse button down. I bought this mouse because my last one started double clicking after years and to have this one double click off the bat is a disappointment.
1,Don't buy this mouse for PvP games if you are anything like me and use a lot of side buttons for PvP the side buttons will randomly cut out and not work no matter what stay away from this mouse like the plague. And when the mouse is not plugged in even if it's fully charged it randomly shuts off. Avoid this mouse like it has COVID
5,Nice for gaming
5,I was able to swap side plates on the fly with no issues from one plate to the other... Best mouse I have ever owned
1,The left click and hold AKA drag and drop feature doesnt work as nthe product will not hold no matter how hard you keep the button pressed. Try dragging something from your inventory ina game to your hotbar and it will take you 30 tries to do it because you will keep "dropping" your item in the middle. Razor Gaming mouse a mouse that doesn't game! Totale failure .Update: I contacted customer support and they said to blow compressed air iunder the button. Compressed air has zero repair effect the issue still persists. second of all I have multiple $10 computer mouse that have been to Iraw ( the most dusty place on the planet) and they still workwhy would a $100 mouse fail from normal  U.S. household levels of dust? Customer support was a unhelpful and a complete waste of time!!!PRODUCT FAIL
5,This mouse is great for MMO gaming and feels comfortable to hold. It took me a few hours to get used to the buttons on the side since I came from a Logitech g502 proteus core but I’m glad I made the leap because this is a good upgrade.
5,Very customizable and great to use but if you dont know how to use the Razer software for key binding understandably difficult to set up for multi use. Took me about half an hour to set everything up including reactive and active lighting and key binds.
4,for xbox
2,It's good for gaming on computers. Feels nice and I haven't had issues yet. Yet it won't work on any other devices there was a game I was hoping to play on my. Ps4 but it's not internally progrmed so none of the buttons work so much for it being the (MMO mouse) when it only works on computer.
2,I've gone through quite a few nagas in the past because they feel the best to me no other mouse even comes close but they always break fairly quickly. This time is a new record though as a spec of dust is apparently lodged in between the sensor for a mouse click causing what is known as the double click issue where it will double click instead of single click like 80% of the time.  This is quite pathetic.
5,Plugged it right in and was able to start. The pieces are excellent and easy to remove. To easy to remove in my opinion the magnet isn’t very big and sometimes the side falls off but that was easily overcame. I really like it a lot
1,dont buy
2,First one I bought worked great for a week and then the wheel tilt randomly stopped working.  Returned.  Second Naga Pro had rgb issues with the number pad.  Returned.  Wanted to try a 3rd one but Amazon said no (third times the charm)  First Razer product to crap out on me straight from the box.  May wait till v2 to give it another shot.  Your mileage may vary.
1,I bought this mouse because I had the previous model and it lasted 8 years.  When it finally went on the fritz I decided to order another one.  I ordered this mouse and used it for about two weeks and it crapped out on me.  The buttons got stuck the mouse stopped working properly and I had to revert to using my old one.  I thought okay well maybe this one was just a fluke and ordered another one.  I started playing with the new one and less than two weeks the stupid thing has already started acting up.  I spoke with another friend who also uses the naga mouse and they have had the same problem recently.  The quality is just not what it used to be so don’t waste your money on this piece of crap.. find another one or an older model when they ACTUALLY WORKED!!!!
5,Great value
5,It's a heavy mouse and I wouldn't recommend it for fps even with the fps side attached
2,I like this mouse. Feels really good.Keep in mind you'll have to buy a separate $50+ charging dock and you'll have to buy a longer connection cable for it. Classic Razer not including necessary items as part of a premium product purchase.I can't support a company that gouges the gaming market.
1,If you have owned Nagas in the past you know that there are usually two little buttons beneath the scroll wheel that act as 4 and 5... I use them to flip quickly through pages as well as ease of movement in MMOs. The Naga X only has ONE extra mouse button in that spot and that button is by default assigned to DPI changes. I saw that it had just one button but assumed that it had a tilt switch for two buttons. It was not. This mouse is completely useless to me as it is-- I will probably get a Trinity instead since it has the two extra buttons that previous models did.
1,For some idiotic reason Razer decided that smooth scrolling was bad and added a metal bar and grooves to the mouse so it bounces and make SUPER LOUD clicking noises when scrolling. The rest of the mouse is amazing but this one "feature" is so bad that is make the mouse unusable.
2,Doesn't have adjustable weight.
2,Was hoping that after updates this would stop happening. Of course it hasn't.Holding down the left mouse button sometimes it just randomly "lets go". I'm still holding the button down but it stops registering that I'm holding it.Never had this problem with my old naga.Don't buy this mouse.
2,Was excited to get a new mouse after having Corsair mouse for 3 years and I get my new Razor mouse all set up and the scroll wheel doesn’t even work. Was very annoyed. :/
1,Double clicking issue. Listen to the reviews that say this mouse will double click on you because it for sure will.Razer products are not that same as they once were unfortunately. Look elsewhere...
5,LOVE em.  The choice to use 3 different ways is so amazing.  Ive had my Razer products for years and never had a problem.  With this mouse on a Razer Firefly mousepad the cursor blazes across the screen for gaming.
5,love it!
4,Because of its ergonomic design it is kind of hard to get use to. Otherwise it's super durable and very functional.
5,Best mouse ive ever owned
1,I would like the mouse if it functioned properly. I have contacted razer support and they think I have an issue with the mouse hardware and will not send another mouse until I send mine back which leaves me without a mouse. Plenty of people are having issues with disconnecting/driver issues with the mouse including myself which is likely due to the synapse required to use by razer. If you use a search engine to look up this mouse with driver and connectivity issues you will see plenty of posts detailing about it. Overall the mouse would be nice if it worked but is not worth the price tag on it as of right now because your mouse randomly stops moving while gaming or just doing general things on your computer.
5,I’m a gamer so I use this a lot. It is so worth the money. Will definitely repurchase if it goes up.
5,We bought this with a razor keyboard they both are extremely cool and very colorful. Nice products great value
5,Best mouse on the market. Simple as that- you can choose between any thumb-button application. And swap in real time. Incredibly comfortable easy to use easy to set up just enjoy. This is coming from someone who tried 3 different mice that werent Razer- (Logitech Roccat Steelseries)
5,I dig Razer products but there's something funny about this one. I think it's the way it fits in my hand. Or maybe it's the weight. Either way cool idea doesn't work for me.
5,Hands down the best gaming mouse I’ve ever had. Having large size hands is hard to find a good gaming mouse.
5,As far as corded mice go this one is perfection.
5,If you play MOBAs or MMOs these arr mee a must have the ability to switch to more or less keys is great so far works good on PC and even on my PS4 for when playing on FFXIV
1,The initial mouse and every replacement I've received has had serious problems from unwanted double-clicking plastic rattling sounds inside of the mouse (clearly something broke internally) stiff/sticky side buttons that don't 'click' the buttons on the side panel sometimes don't work at all and require multiple reseatings and the firmware randomly changes your DPI and can cause input delay. I like the design of this mouse but it simply does not work properly due to being cheaply made and suffering from a myriad of technical problems.The support team (although nice people) requires you to prove your problems by recording video and go through constant rigormarawl designed to waste your time (as a deterrent to RMAing the product). Returning this mouse over and over only to get another broken one in the mail has been a seriously frustrating experience. And to top it all off this is one of the most expensive gaming mice out there... what exactly am I paying for? I don't have time for this.Save your money and your time buy something else that actually works.
5,Liked everything except when I dropped it the middle button broke. Easy to turn up/down speed.
5,Manually controlled dpi scale and rapid change key plates make this a very flexible utility whether you are gaming or perfecting your business documents
5,Best mouse I've used since I started pc gaming the mouse has really great ergonomics and is comfortable in a palm or claw positions
1,2 different mouse models  and 3 different Trinitys specifically and they all have had clicking issues within 1 year.  Took 2 garbage Trinitys that didn't work out of the gate before I got a mouse that has had intermediate right clicking problems (engage/disengage click 10 times a second at worst trying to hold down the right mouse button) after 4 months.  This was a common problem in all Razer mice that I have had.  Razer is garbage.  Everything they make is Garbage.
5,Buttons wear quickly. I have had to buy a couple over the years due to side button wear. Still the best mouse gaming option out there.
5,Good feel in hand comfortable for long gaming sessions. Love the ability to switch side buttons depending on type of game.
1,It says the battery will last "UP TO" 150 hours but it's not even close. I used it for about 18 hours yesterday turned it off before going to sleep and this morning it's dead... The plates don't even work properly when trying to play Valheim. My number 7 button takes out my number 3 weapon. Makes no sense. I'll be returning this and sticking with the wired one provided I can get that one to work again in any of my USB slots.
1,I bought this a little over a year ago and it's now having issues with the left mouse (double clicking can't drag windows/tokens etc). At first I thought that I had gotten some hairs in the laser so I cleaned the bottom of the mouse and nothing improved. Then I figured that maybe my drivers hadn't been updated so I went and checked and that wasn't it. So off to Reddit I went and there I learned that the Razer Nagas have issues with the copper coil on their microswitches. I won't be purchasing a Razer mouse again in for the foreseeable future. I don't want to pay $100 for a mouse that will only last a year.
5,Amazing mouse well worth the money
5,Great gaming mouse doubt I'd consider owning any other type of mouse having used this. I like the removable plates and accuracy is amazing. The software that comes with this product upon install is second to none.
5,It was great and quick for arrival.
1,This “new” trinity design with the swappable plates is awful. They constantly stop working randomly and the life span of one of these new models is about 2-3 months. (I have bought 4 in the past 9 months)This mouse begins to double click after about 2 months. And will be almost unusable after about 3 months. Depending how patient you are on equipment failing you when you need it.I used the original razed Naga for years and it was fantastic I think I had 2 over the span of 8 years. If razer would just re-release the old razer naga quality and customer satisfaction would be a completely different story. It might actually be worth it to buy an older version of this mouse as it will last 10x longer
1,Do not purchase this mouse. I bought one about a year ago from Best Buy. I encountered an issue where about 40% of the time the left click would double click and 40% of the time it wouldn’t register a click at all. So that leaves 20% of the time roughly you get a normal left click. I decided maybe this was just a mistake in production of some sort. I ordered another mouse through amazon on August 15 2020. Today is October 2 2020 and I’m already encountering the same issue. I have been using razor products for years and the quality of product has dropped drastically. I’m going to switch to the Logitech G600 to see if the quality is any better. I’m done with Razer mice As they are expensive and inefficient. Have a good day.
1,After 3 months of ownership holding down the left mouse button no longer works reliably - which is not good for gaming.I reached out to their customer support. First of all it was difficult to find but I was able to create a ticket. From there they requested my serial number purchase date and some other information which I was able to provide except they asked for this multiple times. After providing it they requested a video of the problem. I sent them this video. Overall they have been very unresponsive.This isn't the first time I've had issues with the Naga. Since it's been released in the early 10's I've had 4 of them. The original Naga was a great mouse that I never had problems with and in my opinion was more comfortable to use. The 3 since have all developed problems usually a year after ownership. This most recent one had issues only after 3 months.I don't think I'll buy another Naga mouse and am currently testing out others.
4,Useful
1,I have received 2 of these. The first was dead on arrival (no lights no functions whatsoever). The second works for 10-15 minutes and then goes dark and loses functionality until the USB connector is unplugged and re-plugged ( and disappears from device manager without so much as an error in the machine logs). Please understand that I have several working Razer products and other working mice that I tested; the issues were with this device alone and not related to some other computer or knowledge deficiency. I really wanted this mouse to work as I have had other Razer Naga versions in the past and was fully satisfied. In this case my recommendation is to stay far away the Naga Trinity only leads to disappointment.
5,It is what it is. Badass expensive Razer mouse.
5,This mouse is one of the most comfortable mice i have ever had the chance of owning. I recomend buying if you have big hands like myself because to be able to reach the numberpad on the side of the mouse you need some pretty decent sized hands.
1,This item broke overnight without any interaction while connected to a sleeping computer. I wake up the next morning and this mouse doesn't work at all garbage.
1,Bought this after my Mamba's grips fell off (2nd one with same problem after RMA'ing the first with no hassle).  A bit big but ok then it started to double click when I didn't want it to within a year.  Meaning dragging windows was impossible gaming was impossible.  Tried to RMA this one but they wanted video of it happening even though it's a widely known issue with this mouse.  Decided to switch to a Logitech mouse after they wanted video of the screen and me clicking to prove it was defective.  Sorry not going to try and video the screen and my hand at the same time just to get another run around on getting it RMA'd.Buy at your own risk.  Razer mice are great to begin with out of the box but fail quickly in one way or another. Their build quality and QA needs serious SERIOUS work.
5,I like all the buttons on the side and interchangeable plates. Great for gaming.
5,It totally spoiled me for any other mouse. I primarily use it for WoW and the fit wieght and functionality have been perfect for me. I also appreciate the long tangle free fabric weave cord.
4,Great
5,Very comfortable
5,The razer naga has been my favorite gaming mouse for years I won’t use any other mouse.
5,Great comfortable mouse for gaming.
5,I"m loving my new Razer  Naga Trinity! Feels good in your hand and the wheel is a little bigger. I have the Naga 2012 and it still works great. Lets hope the Trinity last as long.
2,Was an awesome mouse until the left click started to loose recognition that the button was held down causing major issues when you need to hold down the mouse to highlight items or charge up a weapon. Also having issues where the mouse will go bananas and forget it's setting restoring the buttons and sensitivity to default settings. Which in the heat of the moment is the biggest issue you could ever have.Still under warranty. But it's inconvenient and worrisome that maybe it's not the most durable and long lasting product for a premium price..
5,As a gamer I love this mouse.  the side buttons change the game and make playing with mouse and keyboard so much easier.
1,Both Amazon and Razer have been terrible about helping me replace this defective mouse. You'd think that at least 1 of these companies would stand by the product. The mouse after less than 2 months has begun to drag against my hard mouse pad. After thoroughly cleaning the mouse pad and mouse it still has the issue. Item has not been dropped or damaged. The only thing I can figure is that where the replaceable plates meets the base of mouse is uneven. Either way less than 2 months in and I'm stuck now with a defective mouse that Amazon nor Razer will replace. Don't buy this one... go with the Corsair alternative like I should've done in the first place.
2,Everywhere I read prior to purchase said that this worked for a Mac. There were no stipulations or side notes when I purchased. I researched for weeks because I know how hard it is to find gaming things for a Mac. Anyways Razor does not fully support Mac like it claimed to. Their software isn’t Mac compatible at the time of this writing.
5,I’ve been using it for a while and it hasn’t let me down. And while I’m no pro gamer I ain’t no scrub either.
5,My son chose this over all the others he looked at.  He loves this particular brand and he plays games quite a bit.
4,its a very good mouse but its very heavy
1,I literally just bought this mouse. It will not stop clicking by itself. I have went online and tried to find the answer but there isn't one. Most people say it's dust. That is just simply false as I just bought it brand new. Also I'm not taking a brand new mouse apart.And just for the record no I'm using the mouse on a desktop so there is no track pad clicking going on and all the settings are correct. Just do yourself a favor and do not buy this.Also I couldn't imagine trying to type this again as every 5 seconds. It's clicking off the dialog box. lol what a freaking joke.
2,I really want to love this mouse (I've owned 5 of them) and its by far the most comfortable palm grip mouse with crisp buttons I've found. That being said the quality is terrible. Keeping in mind I spend quite a lot of time on the computer and gaming I generally only get 3-6 months out of one before one of 3 things start failing: The scroll wheel the MMO keypad buttons or the right clicker. The mouse does come with a 1-year warranty but honestly they make actually making a claim a huge time sink and pain.
5,no battery.. wtf?
5,Updated my rating to 5/5 now that Razer offers replacement side panels.Thank you razer team.
5,Wish it had more buttons but with integration with synapse u can have double macros.Great product both for gaming and productivity
5,I have been using a Razer Naga 2014 until it started to die recently. I loved the Naga before and this one is just as great as the previous one hopefully this one will also last 5 years.
5,Great product
5,A bit lighter than I am used to. But the 12 buttons are awesome for WoW classic. Nice to be able to swap out side plates.
5,Honestly great mouse enough said its that good
5,3 in one design with a high quality look and feel but also a no way to customize the weight I kept unintentionally lifting the mouse.
5,Works pretty well on MMOs FPSs and even my classics. Only downside is that I wish they didn't discontinue the cordless variant.
1,I don't write reviews that often but I've had enough.  I've bought every full size keyboard and every mmo mouse that Razer has released thus far. I have yet to have a single mouse from Razer last me more than one year and a month. This mouse was used for slightly over 1 year and has the common issue with double clicking/inputting all inputs twice. I'm done with Razer mice at this point and with Razer as a company. I've bought many of their products and to be told to get a replacement I have to pay the full price and wait 18 - 30 days to receive my money back after sending them my mouse or wait one month without any mouse is insane considering I have a product under their warranty that I paid for.I loved it while it worked but razers track record of hardware longevity and stability is bad and getting even worse. We
5,Great mouse. Very comfortable in my hand. Took some getting used to having buttons on the side but once I did it was very nice to have and very easy to switch between weapons in game.
1,They die after about a year I have always loved Razer products and have spent way too much money on top of the line keypads keyboards and mice and quality has just tanked over the years. I have had 3 naga mice and while the features and feel are nice after about a year it gets what acts like a short in the buttons where it won't register clicks or holding the button down.  Mind you this is the left mouse button not one of the weird side buttons the main button to click. I have work mice that are going on 15 years old and don't mess that up. Move on to something else maybe if sales takes a hit they will focus on quality a bit more than features.
5,This has got to be the best MMO/MOBA mouse out there. It's my go to for playing ESO and WoW
5,Customizable buttons you can switch button side plates
1,My 2014 lasted 5 years and I only replaced it because one button was a little sticky. I buy one in summer of 19 quits working contacting Razer and going through their warranty is an absolute joke. Since I don't want  to wait for my replacement and be without a mouse I order a second to use in the meantime and it comes right out of the box defective. I love razer products and I hate to sound like a kid but these new naga trinity's just plain suck. The software is junk and the quality if abysmal. They only reason why they have me cornered is the competition on this particular kind of mouse somehow sucks just a little worse than this new naga. Buy a 2014 naga if you can find one. I am sitting here with as we speak with to $75.00 paper weights.
5,I didn't think I would like the swapped sets at first but they have come in handy and the ergonomics are great
3,I have been a Razer fan for along time I have used game pads keyboards mouse pads and many Naga mouse  over the years I love the Naga. This mouse is not that great since I got it it freezes and disconnected from the pc many times short story find a older Naga if u can
2,I went back to my Naga Epic chroma. The LMB and RMB are awful on this mouse and really unresponsive. Unwanted double clicks and intermittent detection of the keypress. I wish I had returned it but I don't ever really complain. However found a Razer Naga on eBay and i put the Trinity in my closet since I can't return it.  I was really hoping that the trinity would replace the epic but it looks like I will be internet hunting for more Epic before they shoot up in price.
1,I initially bought this mouse in 2019 and it worked well for about 5 months. After Five months however the right-click mouse button started working intermittently and would constantly lose the fact that the button was being pressed. Alright I thought maybe it was just a bad batch/piece and ordered a new mouse. Around 5 months later again the right click mouse button stops realizing that it has been clicked on the new mouse. The games I play are not button mashers this should not be happening this quickly to the mouse buttons and most likely signifies major quality issues. This mouse does not last. Do not buy unless you like burning money. It is unfortunate because the seven button side clicker is extremely useful and convenient.
2,software not compatible with macbook m1 chip
3,Ok extra buttons are nice but grip is terrible.
5,I like this mouse so much I bought 2. 1 for my Desk Top and 1 for my laptop
1,Update: I am now on my 3rd Trinity. Yeah I feel like a fool (especially after my initial review). After the issue you see below the next TWO (one being replaced by Razer) have had double click issues. Click once and it double clicks. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I am finished with Razer.This mouse feels great and I love the 7 side button ring. Really is the reason I bought it as I've owned the Hex and Hex 2. But after 4 months of use the top Forward button is already going out and requires that it be pressed in a particular way. On top of this the side buttons will occasionally stop working. Not all of them just some and it requires that you remove the panel and put it back on. I just can't recommend this mouse to anyone. This is easily the worst Razer product I have ever bought. I really do not find the utility in the removable panel as I never use the other two.
1,Don't get this mouse. I got this for a moba where I wanted to bind a lot of my in-game controls to. It was great at first but than the infamous issue with the left click button began. I'm not so sure it's the double clicking but many times when I'm clicking left click to fire an auto or ability it just doesn't do anything. It's gotten to the point where the frustration outweighs the convenience of all the programmable options. Not only that but the #11 button on the 12-button panel has stopped working along with the leftward and rightward click on the scroll wheel. For a $100 mouse the durability is just unacceptable and the only solution I could find is to tear to the mouse apart.
4,This mouse was a replacement for my old naga hex. It's bigger than wanted but I grew to like it.
5,When setting up this mouse was easy to plug in and play. But it was almost too sensitive to begin with. It was so fast I overshot things on my computer. Was able to fix. So now works  beautifully!
1,My dps buttons stopped working after less than a month got it March 17th it’s now April 12th and both buttons don’t function for some reason I’ve kept the mouse in good condition and it’s not like I’ve ever slammed the thing I’ve had it for 3 weeks lol and the buttons on the side will not work at all sometimes unless I open up the razer app that has terrible design for me to even bind the numbers to buttons half the time it works half the time it doesn’t. Just spend your money on another brand all together first time trying razer and my last time as well
2,I've gone through two of these since May 2019. Both have had the same problem. Eventually the left mouse button starts to become unresponsive and not register. For the cost of the device that failing that quickly is pretty unacceptable. I've had G600s last for multiple years without issues. If you're looking for an MMO mouse go for one of those instead.
5,I like the responsiveness and ease of use. They could drop the price down and release a newer version.
5,Super cool with the side swaps comfy and is just over all really cool!
1,An update pushed through two months after purchase and the mouse suddenly couldn't keep a connection. Gave up trouble shooting after deciding razers just aren't worth it.
5,Sleek easily customizable through the synapse app and feels really smooth and nice to use. Exactly what I was looking for.
1,No matter how many steps I took to troubleshoot and diagnose the issue I just couldn't get the mouse to work. The cursor skips all over the place; even if you turn the DPI down. Updated firmware changed calibration cleaned sensor tried using it wired. Nothing works. Back to using my 6-year-old Logitech G502 that still works perfectly fine while I shop for a better option. Will never buy another Razer.Google "Razer Naga Pro Skipping" to see all the other people pulling their hair out trying to fix this mouse.
2,This is the third one I've had. They are the best mouse I've used for MMOs but always has a problem a year or so later. Either software or hardware. See buttons stick or disengage while it's still being held down. Extremely tired of paying $70-80 every year or two for a mouse. When the Naga first came out it lasted for a long time now a year if you're lucky with no issues.
1,Disappointed that it is lighter than the Naga epic chroma and that the palm profile has been reduced. I am a palm grip now the new naga pro has forced me into a claw grip.It feels EXTREMELY cheap for 150$ really disappointed they cut serious corners.Like the gloss finish can be hated for the fingerprints but this matte finish is awful to the touch repulsive even.I have owned the Naga 2014 Naga Epic chroma 2018.This is the weakest of the 3 they should have ran just the iconic 12 button side and dropped the modularity.If they keep this attitude towards the Naga it'll be a dead line in no time.
5,Best mouse I’ve got so far love how light it is for being a pretty good size mouse. Also love the different ways I could use this mouse to game!
1,This was pretty good for a week... spent a bit of cash to get a new Naga last one lasted me like 10 years this one 7-10 days... you guys really did turn into the BS company everyone said you did.Update this is still the biggest piece of garbage out there.
5,Got it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he refuses to play his games without it now.
2,You cannot shutdown Windows or put it in sleep mode with the mouse connected it just wakes windows up almost immediately. Razer claims it's a Windows issue but I've never heard of this being a problem with any other manufacturer's mice.
3,Gaming
5,I loved the old naga this made it so much better. I can choose what side piece to connect to it so while I am at work I can change it to the 2 button and at home it goes to the 12
2,Left mouse button constantly multi clicks and causes a lot of issues while gaming and or trying to drag and drop or use a box select option. I love the mouse but this issue gives it a 2 for me overall. Hopefully Razer will assist me in getting it replaced.
1,Nothing but issues from day one with this mouse. I've used Razer Naga mouses for years and this has been the worst iteration thus far. I got this one after my Razer Naga Chroma crapped out on me after like 3 months. The side panel is magnetic so the signal disconnects quite easily which during the heat of the moment in a game is not ideal. There is no real indication as to when it disconnects as the lights still work but the side panel buttons becomes completely unresponsive which is a feature I find frustrating. Luckily while your dead in game you can take the time to trouble shoot it as to what went wrong fix it only to have it happen several more times until you give up. I'm not sure what happened the QA with Razer over the years but their products have become trash. I suggest buying a different mouse for the price of this mouse it shouldn't have as many issues as it does.
3,This mouse breaks so easily it's insane I've had three of them have some form of manufacturer defectBut in the end you need it if you wanna play MMOs
5,Very easy to switch out button side panels. I play one MMO with the 16 button and switch it out for 2 button on FPS every-time. Great mouse.
5,Works perfectly as described and pictured. Interchangeable numbers work perfectly. No problems what so ever.
5,Amazing!
2,Scroll button and 1-4 buttons are broken after one year of use. I use this for gaming not even everyday office use and it's already breaking.
2,Would be great if it would last longer then a year before the switches in the main mouse buttons start going out. This is my second one both not lasting very long both having the same issue... so I guess it is time to find a better product
5,I just really like this mouse feels nice in my hand. The buttons on the side add a new depth to gaming.
2,This is the most expensive mouse I've ever bought. Less than a year out it's already given out. I've never had a mouse crap out this quickly before and I've used cheap logitech mice most of my life.Specifically the mouse is gradually not holding down 'clicks' anymore so clicking and dragging only half the time. Frustrating trying to game make music or do anything besides simple clicking.
5,Not much to say other then working as intended. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 its perfect and the swap is so easy I do it on the fly all the time.
1,I bought this mouse as an MMO mouse and the looks and feel are great however the right click is very loose and double clicks. I had the mouse RMA'd which took about a month through razers silky smooth RMA process. Once I recieved the new item the "new" item had the same exact problem as the mouse I shipped back for a replacement.This issue was than brought back up to razer and they were going to refund me my money via store credit. Howver the only thing I wanted via razer was this mouse.Compared to the Logitech g600 and Corsair Schimitar this mouse is far behind in quality. If you are looking for a quality MMO I would recommend the Logitech g600 which has a far better feel and will not have any RMA issues.  It will lack some RBG but the function out ways the flare.Sadly razer still lacks in the quality and RMA/customer service department.
1,I've had two of these mice over the last year and BOTH have had problems when pressing down on the right click. I can hold my finger down during a game and it will zoom in and out and in and out over and over if my finger isn't pressing on it in an exact way. It's not my computer it's the mouse. One time I can understand but when I buy a second one and experience another bad micro switch it speaks plenty about the "quality" of these mice.
1,I guess I just have the worst luck when it comes to these mice. My Razer keyboard has worked great for years but this mouse stopped working correctly after 3 months the left click button just doesnt work anymore.I bought this one to replace my previous razer naga because the sensor just stopped working and the cursor would not move at all unless i flipped the mouse over and rubbed my finger across it. That one was only a year old when it stopped working and I purchased it to replace  previous razer naga where again the left click button just stopped working.Unfortunately I am going to have to find another brand at this points really sucks too because I love the everything else Razer makes.
1,Razers seriously frickalickin 5 out of 5 for faulty products for me. I've been with them for 15 years. Theyve treated me lesssssssssss than frickin stellar and honestly I'm glad other manufacturers are picking up steam. (literally lol)  like wow- I just tried to RMA this and theyre sending me through the HOOPS. Literally every other rma ANYWHERE is easier.Cheap transistors till the day they die huh? -- literally if they just spent the money on better transistors like everyones been asking for years this wouldnt be a problem- I cant use this mouse after 12 months. Something that has been a common occurrence for years now. Never again lol you treat your customers like garboooo
1,I bought this mouse because my Naga Trinity wore out after 3 years of use and i wanted another one similar to the feel. I thought this mouse would work but come to find out after a month of use the left click started bugging out and not working. After 5 minutes of looking into the issue it turns out there's a defect with the spring that thousands of people are all dealing with. Then I figured to just contact Razer support because they'd be able to help but NOPE! It took them almost 2 months to try and help me with almost 1 week between each response on my support ticket. They kept asking me the same questions I already answered because for some reason they can't look back at previous responses. All in all I'd recommend you find a different mouse because this one already comes broken with the guaranteed seal of Razer not owning up to a defect with the mouse
1,Started double clicking 6 months after purchase. By about 16 months the mouse was unusable. Worst mouse I've ever owned.
2,The right click doesn't stick down when holding it it will fairly often stop and then restart causing issues in games where holding right click is required (World of warcraft FPS game's where you ADS ect). Even on desktop if you hold right click and drag it will stop and pop up the menu instead. This is pretty infuriating as I've owned a great deal of razer products and never had this issue and i've only had this mouse for a little over a month..
5,My son was so happy with this. Exactly what he was looking for. Thanks.
5,My son loves his new gaming mouse... He's been staying up later than normal though.. Haha
5,The attachments could be useful if you dont want the number pad I guess. Either way it's a great mouse.
1,3 months seems to be the magic number with this mouse because like many other reviewers it took 3 months before this mouse has crapped out. Go find a different brand because this one is a waste of money.
1,My mouse has 2 months only and I can tell you that is already broken.I use my things very carefully however the left click started to give problems.Let me show you an example:If you go on "PAINT" and you draw a straight line holding the left click =  _____________________ it should draw a straight line  right?Ok instead than drawing a straight line when I hold the left click the lines look like this: ____ ______ _____Meaning?The left click is not responding is losing the touch the cheap materials that is built with is getting lose is damaged already by my usage ( 2 months).IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE AND THE DURABILITY.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT guys I'm serious look for another option until they announce that it got fixed.
2,The right click is messed up. In games it zooms in and out repetitively. I bought the 2 year warranty but am unable to get any information on how to replace it. Warranty was a waste of money sales gimmick each click gives you the run around. Mouse was a waste of money.
5,AMAZING mouse with TONS of programmable buttons. It is very comfortable for long term use and it is reliable and accurate. I will be using this mouse for many years to come
5,I would recommend
2,The mouse seems like it would be solid but I’ve been sent the wrong used older model and when I requested a new one it came all beat up missing the faceplates.The mouse seems really great from videos and reviews so I would suggest buying this at a different store in person
5,Comes with 3 different side plate layouts. Easy to switch to whatever you prefer! The Razer software is super easy to use. I couldn’t recommend this enough!
5,Love the feel of it and the interchangeable components works well haven't noticed anything wrong with it or it's performance in the two months or so of purchase
2,The good: perfect size button layout close but not cramped actuation crisp solid build quality. The bad: It. Doesn't. Work. I thought it was me. I games enough that I thought I just burn through them but after my second one the right button mouse stops working and in an MMO where you need to move around with right mouse it is game breaking. Always used the Naga before this model but never again until Razer figures it out.
1,Do you like mouses that glide over whatever surface you put them on or at least the bare minimum mouse pad? Well don't get this if you do. I even have the special rgb mouse pad from razer and after only a year of use as you use it you just feel it grind against the mouse pad. This is ridiculous for a product of this price range. I only upgraded from my other really nice razer mouse because its not supported on the newer hardware. It lasted years of heavy use. This mouse is trash.
1,Razer support is non existent! I can't get these people to help me no matter how hard I try. I'm replacing a Razer Naga with a Razer Naga Trinity because the old one died 2 months out of warranty. This mouse should plug and play but it doesn't. The few times Razer has responded via email after placing phone calls with long wait times once I respond Razer is unresponsive. This has been going on for 5 weeks Razer simply no longer supports their products properly since the IPO was launched. I've been using Razer products for over a decade. I am now having to work with Amazon and my Credit Card company to have this declared Fraud simply because I can't get support on a brand new piece of hardware. It's disgraceful!
5,Best things ever. And if you play World of Warcraft then you will probly kneel down to salute this king of all mouse-kind.
5,Pretty big fan of the mouse it’s pretty easy to maneuver not to heavy (big complaint from razer mouse products) I bought a bunch of razer gear and this is probably my favorite thing.
2,Im not a big fan of this mouse. I bought it to upgrade from the razor naga. This mouse is MUCH larger and not a comfortable grip when switching from something like the naga. I used it for about a week and could not get used to the size so I switched back to my old mouse. Too bad I guess
1,At first I absolutely loved this mouse. The feel of it the Moba side button layout was exactly what I was looking for. But it wasn't long until the main left mouse button started glitching out. It wouldn't register clicks. And forget about dragging- it would only register that the button was held down maybe half the time and even when you could get it to drag it would release half way through and then connect again. This is a wired mouse that seemed like it was low on battery. Such a disappointment. Buddy of mine said he's gone through 4 Razer mice and the main mouse buttons have all crapped out. He's vowed never to buy Razer again and I think I'm with him. Get a Logitech instead.
1,This thing worked great when I first purchased it. Now certain buttons work at periodic times. Somtimes my right click acts like it is constantly clicking when held down and some times it doesnt click at all. Some times my 1-12 work and some times they dont. If you remove the side piece and put it back on the issue is temporaily corrected but this could be for a minute or an hour. The razer naga trinity would be a great mouse if it worked but apparently the build quality is terrible. This has got me killed in games multiple times and has become verry frustrating. I used to love razer products but I will never buy another one again.
2,Unfortunately the cheaply printed serial number wiped off while cleaning the mouse so I was unable to get any sort of warranty support. This is the second Razer mouse that I've had with a similar problem over the years.Never again. I liked Razer products a lot but I insist on my gear lasting more than 15 months. I've had cheap chinese-branded mice last longer.
5,Not much to say. Best mouse i've ever used. Stepped my gaming up a long time ago and ever since I only use NAGAs. I've purchased 3 now never once unsatisfied.
5,This is a great mouse. I had the naga hex v2 which was unfortunately discontinued. I love being able to still have the same button layout as my hex when needed.
1,This is essentially the perfect gaming mouse for me. Sadly THIS PRODUCT is simply defective. Not my device is defective the whole product line seems to suffer from the same as of yet unaddressed issue.  After less than 30 days use on two separate devices both began exhibiting the left click / double click issue rendering the mouse of my dreams into a very expensive paper weight. If you spend a few hours troubleshooting with Razor support they will RMA you a new device which will have the same exact defect in a few weeks. I'll update this review with the mouse I choose next.  As a love of Razor devices for a decade please don't buy this mouse.
5,Love this mouse program works great the magnetic clip in and out button pads work great.
1,Absolutely hate this mouse. I had the wireless naga epic from 2014 and loved it. The cord has become sensitive and will “disconnect” leaving me with no mouse until I readjust it. It still charges but I have limited time to play before it dies.Onto the trinity. I hate the software. It isn’t user friendly. The mouse itself isn’t ready when you plug it in but you’re forced to download and use software for a mouse. I don’t need extra profiles. All the extra “bells and whistles” is taking time I could be gaming.The 2 buttons behind the mouse are not reprogrammable. So disappointed since I use them in games frequently. So you actually have less buttons for gaming than advertised. I am sending this back. I am so disgusted with this brand. No more razer products in the future. Razer needs to check back to why their earlier models and naga epic were great. What happened razer?
5,Been using the Razer Naga Mouse for years and decided to get this new Trinity version. (Old one was aging!)I love the detachable side panels and comfort for gaming. Definitely a repeat customer!!!
5,It's like having the best of the razer mouse lineup all in one. I use the 12 key attachment the most coming from the original nagas though I have used the 7 key circle here and there and so far love it.
1,This is my third razor mouse you would think I would learn after the second one. I had razor diamondback the scroll wheel stopped working after a while. I got a MMO mouse Naga Trinity after 1 year and a half the right click is double-clicking so I got this one Naga X. It was good light then a few days later it won't connect to my computer. I would unplug it plug it in it would recognize it for few minutes then it would disconnect. Do not get a razor it's just unreliable.
1,I've owned razer products my entire life. I had a Naga Chroma before this that I have had for 2+ years and it still works just fine. I wanted to upgrade and see what this new mouse was all about. Here I am a few months later and the right click has already stopped working consistently. It is hit or miss and for FPS gameplay (right click zooms in) that is unacceptable for the mouse to just not register the click. Avoid this mouse it's really unfortunate but I'll be going with another company for my Mouse needs from now on. Also there points on the mouse were the paint has begun to come off. Really poor quality from razer.
3,Not up to the quality I am used to from Razer in regards to materials. But it does work the way it's intended. There were issues with the magnets not holding and the buttons and losing connection. But over time this has seem to have lessened.
1,We've bought three of these and each didn't last a year. For the price that's absolutely unacceptable. Mice that we've bought that are around the $20 mark have lasted longer and are more reliable than these.Each have developed the double click issue where the mouse seems to stop working for a brief moment and then it re-grabs whatever you were clicking on. Eventually the clicking stops working all together.This brand used to be THE THING to buy but the past several years with no obvious improvements or fixing this issue has put it on the "never buy" list in our house. Do yourself a favor and do the same.
1,I'm a glutton for punishment. This is the 2nd Naga Trinity I have purchased and overall the 6th Naga I've purchased. Every single one develops a double-clicking problem in the left click button after 6 months. This latest one made it from late May to early August. Technical support has been no help at all for any of them.It's a beautiful mouse and the lights are amazing but this no longer justifies repeat purchases. I'm really disappointed since they are one of the few MMO mice out there. It's a well documented and obvious problem and it's sad that they refuse to acknowledge or fix it. I've sunk so much money into these mice but Razr will no longer be rewarded for their bad behavior.
5,The three different pannels are easy to swap between and it makes going from WoW to LoL to CS a breeze.
1,I really wanted to love this mouse but there is a widespread issue where the mouse will intermittently freeze while using it with the 2.4 GHz connection.After looking at other reviews and the Razer community forums it is clear that this is a widespread issue with this mouse that has been happening for many years now. This reflects extremely poorly on Razer.
1,Just to echo the other reviews. I use the 12 buttons on the side for my WoW keybinds and within 4 months of me buying it the 12 started going haywire with ====================== relentlessly after pressing it a bit harder it stops and the mouse begins working on the desktop only. As soon as I fire up WoW the 12 button panels goes dead my profile is set up and right (using Synapse V3) and it is just not wow either any game I open the panel is dead. I went through the motions of every single troubleshooting protocol I could could only handle the representative for about an hour before I realized he was going in circles and could not help me. Razer quality is dropping for profits simple as that do yourself a favor and just get a Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse for 20 dollars and call it a day.
5,I bought this to replace my old one. So I could have one for my laptop without having to plug and unplug from desktop! I
1,This mouse is amazing when you first get it. One day in the middle of a boss fight some numbers will just randomly stop working. You google and find out removing the side piece will fix the issue. You try it and it works. A couple of days later different buttons stop working. No problem just remove the side again. That will go on for about a month then randomly you can't right or left click anything. Can't remove those and stick them back on to fix it so you are truly screwed. Save yourself the money and don't get Naga gaming mice. this is my third and last Naga purchase I will ever make.
5,I’m a palm gripper and love the Naga Trinity because of its shape and extra buttons! It maintained & improved on everything I loved about my previous Naga 2014
4,Pros:VersatileMechanical buttonsAcute sensorCons:ExpensiveHeavy-which can be a pro or con
2,Amazing timing 2 year limited warranty 2 years and 1 month after purchase the left click will intermittently not hold resulting is double triple clicks or nothing at all.  Affects dragging windows or gaming where holding the button is needed.  The switch is obviously defective.  For a mouse that cost this much the build quality should enable the product to last for several years.  What has happened to Razer?
1,Back when they first started producing mice I was buying them. Boomslangs; the optical pickup was amazing. Problem was the left mouse button fails. This POS is no exception. Almost 2 years into it and it starts randomly double-tapping for no reason. This is problematic when I'm trying to do finite work. I contact support oddly 3 days before the warranty was supposed to run out. They ask me all kinds of troubleshooting wait until A DAY AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRES and tell me IT'S OUT OF WARRANTY! Never again. DO NOT BUY!!!Side note: The blue LED in the front of the mouse failed in 6 months. I should have RMA'd it then but wasn't concerned with lights. Quality is non-existent.
5,macro program each key best ever
5,Well made comes with all 3 attachments I use the 12 button one  its comes with a 6 and 2 button array aswell.
5,Hands down the best mouse I've ever owned! Comfortable quick smooth pieces snap easily. My only qualm is the razer program used to control it isn't the greatest.
1,I bought this hoping to replace my Naga Epic mouse that just has the 12 buttons on the side. It lasted me like 10 years and still works great. Razor is great as far as customer service goes they are replacing my broken Naga Pro. I wish I could get my money back. It's cheaply made and extremely large compared to other mice. If you have small hands DON'T Buy!!! It's very uncomfortable.If you are buying the 12 buttons for MMORPG's like WoW go for a completely different mouse or an older Naga. I wish I had my $150 back.
1,This is my 2nd razer naga trinity. The first one lasted over 2 years before it started double clicking and I do play some high APM games and game probably more than I should. The 2nd one lasted less than 6 months before the double clicking started to happen. If you do end up buying this product make sure you by the warranty through amazon because the razer support is close to worthless. I would recommend not support razer because their build quality has gone down hill so much. I had a naga epic before this that lasted 4-5 years I do not expect a mouse to last that long but once every 2 years for replacing a mouse would be nice.
1,Electronics returned to Amazon usually present a malfunction problem and diagnosis isn't fully assess before trying to sell the item again. It sounds legit to buy a "like new" mouse and saving some $$ but the Razer Naga Trinity Gaming Mouse from Amazon Warehouse turned to be broken with its motion sensor absent. The Item was returned with Prime free shipping writing on the box with black sharpie the problem of that mouse. It was another waste of time and hope this mouse won't be sold back on Amazon... If you see my handwriting on the box be prepared !Robust accurate and reliable. I love gaming with it. First order Razer Naga Trinity Gaming Mouse from Amazon Warehouse which reveal to have broken its motion sensor than had issue with Windows 10 newly updates and incompatibility nightmare troubleshooting with Razer software. Logitech G600 MMO was a simply plug and play. GG!
5,Too small for my hand but so is every other mouse ever made.
5,Big Razer Fan this mouse is awesome
1,This mouse is too sensitive. I barely touch buttons and they activate. Furthermore the mouse has some programming glitches. Don't reprogram mouse in synapse and then put the mouse on a computer without synapse. You will have no end to bugs on this mouse if you do. It will invert key bindings and start acting weird if you do. This mouse would only be worth $74 if programmed correctly. Right now its value is only the a tiny computer and plastic parts and magnets since it fails to provide an ideal gaming experience compared to its older model. I only bought this one because my mouse wheel broke on the older model. May have to switch brands.Both mousse I bought  with this brand have a very fragile mouse wheel which breaks way too easily. Do not buy unless you can guarantee you won't drop it on its mouse m3 wheel on accident because it will break.
4,The mouse is mechanically sound however the software tends to lag quite a bit on my computer.
5,Dont be fooled this is the best gaming mouse
1,After only 4 months of use the left mouse button is faulty. Multiple rapid clicks while holding the button down and failing to drag windows render this mouse totally unusable without repairs. Before this mouse I owned 3 other Razer Naga products including the Naga 2012 and two Naga Chroma which worked great.I don't know if this is just some manufacturing oversight but this part is failing extremely commonly in these mice and unless you have a hundred dollars worth of tools and knowledge to solder a new micro controller stay away from this mouse. There are quite a few of alternatives to the Naga that are half the price and have better software.At some point Razer became the Tommy Hilfiger of gaming peripherals. High cost for products that are really no better than (and in some cases like the Razer Synapse 3 software worse than) cheaper alternatives like the Logitech G600.
5,A+ product. The last razer mouse I bought lasted me 8 years hoping this will do the same!
1,The mouse feels nice in hand but the over-sensitivity of the side buttons is to big of an issue.Mouse 4 and 5 are placed right where you would want to grip the mouse and just brushing your thumb past the side buttons will trigger an input. Having two extra buttons on the side off a mouse is a basic feature at this point and with them being so poorly implemented it makes this mouse infuriating to use. Sure you could think more about your thumb placement but there are much cheaper mice where you don't have to bother thinking about that with no loss in functionality.Being able to hot swap the side buttons of the mouse sounds nice but the problem is just exacerbated with adding more buttons.
1,I have purchased several Razer products throughout my life but I can honestly say that I will never purchase a Razer product again. This is the third Razer mouse I have owned and the third Razer mouse that has developed a double-clicking issue causing it to be unusable. After contacting Razer support there is no option to refund the mouse. The only option they allow is to send the mouse back to possibly have a replacement shipped. For someone that uses their mouse daily for work school and pleasure this is unacceptable. Don't waste your money purchase from a different manufacturer that will stand by their product.
5,For daily use as for games it's very good device. The option to create macros is helpful.
2,10 months later and the right click is already starting to fail.  This is the 3rd Razer mouse I've owned where either the left or right buttons start to fail within the first year.  They never do anything to help replace or resolve the problems. Their support always says to reinstall the PC software.  Like that will fix a physical button.No more Razer products for me.
5,Love this mouse fits perfectly and the buttons are very easy to press for gaming. A little sad the box it came in was smashed in
5,Amazing mouse!!!
1,The 12 button panel is malfunctioning after only 5 months. Randomly rows of buttons stop working (which is terrible during pulls in game) and it requires buttom mashing the panel to get them up again. It's so bad I'm using an old scimitar with a scuffed right click and it works 100x better.Keep in mind I have updated the mouse firmware reinstalled synapse factory reset the mouse etc to try and fix the issue.160$ down the drain lol.
1,Originally bought the Razer Naga Trinity in October 2020 but ended up getting the "Double click/misclick" in March 2021. Ended up buying the Razer Naga X last month (June 2021) in hopes that it was only the Trinity that had the issue. I didn't end up with a misclick... ended up with a non-functional mouse as of July 2021.... literally only 1 month of use. As of now I would stay away from razer products but I have no clue what other MMO mouse is as comfortable... too bad they're virtually unusable.
1,But the side panels and macros are nice even if unassigned macros will play off unselected profiles and even if it only registers so many unique keys at one time mostly upset at the software doing weird things to my mice on both mice (both computers) like activating macros from other profiles as stated or randomly changing dpi or closing software no longer receiving input cannot create click hold macro
1,After a few months my mouse started double-clicking and screwing up LMB drags and clicks due to some kind of spring issue that is apparently pretty common with these mice. Was really cool while it lasted (about 8 months) but I cannot recommend this mouse to anyone on good faith. I've had logitech devices last the better part of a decade with no problems. This mouse eats it after a few months? And there are loads of people experiencing the same issue for years with not just THIS mouse but other models as well? Reeks of planned obsolescence to me. Steer clear.
5,Quality mouse with great customization and feel. Would wholeheartedly recommend to other people
2,Everything about this mouse is great except for one fatal flaw: The left-mouse button doesnt always register when clicking and randomly double-clicks. Incredibly frustrating when gaming. The issue is the mouse was built with an incredibly weak spring. Multiple razer mice are affected by this. But come on... 4 months? For $70+ it's unacceptable. Wish me luck getting any response out of their returns dept.
5,I have had numerous predecessor Razer mice and they all seemed to have tracking issues could have been the software.  I love this one because of the interchangeability.
4,Amazing product. It works perfectly no delay on movement. Not laggy jittery movements either.
5,I would use any other mouse for gaming or work
2,I bought this mouse because I play a lot of different types of games so the interchangeability of the side buttons seemed great for my needs. If it weren't for the dang double clicking this mouse would probably be great. However after only having this mouse for less than a month it has already began double clicking. It is VERY annoying and greatly affects game-play so I simply cannot recommend this mouse to anyone looking to play games with it. DO NOT BUY.
5,Purchased this for a friend that can only use his right hand. This mouse allows him to program the side buttons for other things that he would normally do with his left. It works great.
1,Pros:- Fits my medium sized hands perfectly.- The 7 button panel is easy to use and usually you don't "fat finger" it.Cons:- Thumb buttons on any of the panel attachments just simply don't respond sometimes or there is a delay between when you press it to when the action/fuction is performed.- On the other hand sometimes you press a button and the action/function is performed more than the duration of the button being held. This happens with or without the Turbo function.- Can't assign some keybinds because it says Synapse needs to be running when it is definitely running.For a $80 USD Mouse I cannot recommend it at all.Overall there's no mouse on the market that is good. Everything I've used over the years always has Hardware and/or Software issues.
5,I have always used razer products. I love how you can change the sensitivity on the top button of the mouse as well as the macro changes for the side buttons.
5,Most comfortable mouse I have ever had for my big fat hands.
1,I loved this mouse until the left click started going faulty. I tried cleaning it and have had no success fixing the issue. Most of the time the left click will work. Sometimes even double clicks when it isn't supposed too. For a gaming mouse this isn't exactly acceptable. Especially since it's just over a year old. Would not recommend for the serious gamers wanting something they won't have to replace shortly after. Here I come Logitech..
1,I have bought various Razer products and all end in the trash worst customer support worst product useful life worst experience. Despite my likeness for the brand and what they try to accomplish my experiences time after time has just let me down!Support the company if you live in the US and have a lot of free time and can return them this product time after time otherwise DO NOT BUY RAZER products if you live outside the US.
1,The build quality of this thing is very poor I dropped it from the height of my mattress ONCE onto my carpet and now it no longer charges gotta keep the thing plugged in to use it the buttons will randomly stop working including the left and right clicks it's just been a frustrating and terrible experience.Razer you guys really need to get together and realize that cheaping out on production costs is only going to hurt your brand going forward. Here's some advice from a random Amazon review go back to the drawing board and reinvent your brand new logo new quality over quantity mentality and better customer support.
2,DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE. The software for switching profiles provided by razer is atrocious. Every time you do a profile switch (which will likely be frequent think switching back and forth between a game and chrome) it lags your whole system for anywhere from half a second to two seconds. The old synapse didn't have this problem my old naga works great. But they replaced that beautifully simple and quick software with a heavy non-intuitive clunky mess. Get the old razer naga not this one.
2,I have gone through 2 Nagas within 2 years because of a double click/release issue. This is the second Razer product I’ve gone though that has had repeating issue within 2 years. They are great while they work but have issues very quickly. I cannot recommend it.
5,Great gift
2,Ordered on December 29 2018Todays date 10/10/2019Mouse is already starting to double click on single clicks. As well as making it unable to drag and drop items. When the left mouse button is held down the mouse will instead think you are either rapidly clicking or only clicked once and not holding.I am not likely to order another Razer mouse. I have been having bad luck with the last (2) I have ordered as well as their Razer Huntsmen Elite Keyboard.
1,I picked this up hoping to take advantage of the various side buttons but was disappointed by the ergonomics. i'm not sure if it's because i use a palm grip or the way I'm used to using my thumb to help hold the mouse. Either way it has been impossible to comfortably hold and use this mouse without accidentally hitting the extra buttons.Even when i swapped in the normal 2-button side plates the ergonomics of the mouse don't feel good. I'd want something shaped more like a DeathAdder.Just beware before buying this. Take a look at where you put your thumb on your current mouse. How would it feel if there were 12 seemingly-identical buttons right where your thumb goes that were super-easy to hit?
5,This mouse is fantastic. The panels swap out easily and it is very responsive. However if you have smaller hands you will need a wrist rest.
5,Good fits my hand prefect. Love the 3 Changeable side button plates.
1,So the naga "pro" is just a naga trinity for twice the price? And if I want to buy the same $70 pricepoint mouse I no longer get the mousewheel tilt that is absolutely critical to me?I guess the thinking was that after driving away half their customers with horrible quality and awful software rollouts they needed to double the price to squeeze the same revenue from the remaining customers.The really sad thing is when I saw the optical switch on the Naga X I thought Razer might finally be back to making decent mice. Then I saw they cut features and didn't actually cut the price.$70 is the budget option?!You don't have to buy a cheap knockoff to move away from Razer. There are plenty of reputable brands that make superior products with the same functionality at a lower price.
1,I have owned this mouse for around 7 months now. No complaints about the SW and programmability. Standard Razer top notch.The issue is the left click switch started to randomly fail to register. Noticed it while gaming and confirmed with regular use. Selecting text is a total chore.Opened a ticket with Razer done all the troubleshooting. Waiting for RMA.By the way nice touch in the support ticket: Send us a video of you having the issue... I should have sent our Raid wipe due to missed healing the the MT due to left click not working.
5,Easiest mouse on the market to use straight out of the box!!
1,For having to pay a premium price for inferior manufacturing. I used this mouse for about 4 months before I started to have double click with my left click fast forward 4 more months and the right click now double clicks. I am also writing this on a Razer keyboard and you wouldn't believe how many times it puts in a double input... It seems like the switches that they are using are way bad. These will be the last Razer product that I will purchase. Logitech or Corsair seems like the way to go if you are looking for quality.
2,Its a mouse.  I have had more difficulty getting this mouse to perform its basic functions while in Linux than any other mouse I've ever owned.  It performs worse than the off brand $20 Bluetooth mice on Amazon.  I would only purchase this if a hardcore gamer who collects Razer products for the lighting effects.  Otherwise meh.
1,I got this to replace an aged razer naga chroma which ran fine on razer synapse 2. This mouse is not found using that software so Razer synapse 3 must be installed. Fine not a problem. Except... Razer synapse 3 has been in beta for over a year now which long standing issues and what renders this mouse utterly useless for me is that YOU CANNOT IMPORT MACROS OR KEY BINDING FROM A PREVIOUS NAGA. Support says you will be able to once the software is out of beta. So maybe I can use the mouse in a couple more years.Can you imagine? Selling a brand new product that depends fundamentally on software that they didn't even bother to finish. Might as well try some other brands now that I need to redo the key bindings for EVERY PROFILE anyway. Utterly unacceptable.
5,Bought new one to replace bf old one. He likes it with the changes of  side plates.
1,Of the last two Razer mice that I've bought one lasted 9 months and the other around 5.  The process to make a warranty claim is absurd to the point that I would rather just give up on Razer products.  The response to my warranty ticket included a laundry list of chores for me to troubleshoot then they wanted me to send logs from Synapse and make a video of the product not working.  Great mice when they work the problem is that they seem to stop working pretty fast and customer care is pretty terrible.
5,Bought as gift son loves it. Easy to use. Has very useful button options which makes it easy for son to use for gaming controls.
5,Perfect for FPS or RPG game styles
1,I have been using Razor naga since 2009 and I have been very happy with it. Then I purchased the trinity four months in..it broke. unusable.  I spent hours trouble shooting before contacting customer support.  I explained everything I did and they had me do it again.. ok no problem..I get that.  Then they decided to 'replace' it. but it takes up to 24 hours to get the shipping label to send it back then the shipping time..then the processing time on their end before they even send you the replacement.  that could be over a week easy.So then I was offered to have it escalated.. great! but that process takes up to two days before they even decide if they will or not.  So if they say no..then you have two days tacked on to the initial week or more.the frustration is real.
3,mmo buttons are very slipper - i like old versions better
5,Would buy again! Fast shipping and cane as desired.
1,This mouse will drop out on you constantly. I read the reviews warning against buying this and I took my chances. Totally not worth it. Just get the wired one if you want a razer mouse. Sad that this mouse didn't work right.
3,Sometimes my mouse start "writing" random characters like "XSCXSCDSXSCDSXCDSXS" for ever the only way to correct this is unplug and replug the device...
2,The precision on this mouse is poor at best accuracy is there but fails to perform for gaming or even web browsing.  The macro buttons only support a single button output to be programmed so when you use the side mouse buttons you are limited on one button output per click.  Buy any mouse but this and you'll probably be better off.
1,I've owned multiple Razer products over the years but this mouse is the worst one I have had the displeasure of owning. Upon first using it I noticed the buttons for 10 11 and 12 (for the MMO faceplate) would push in further than the rest of the buttons and make a crunch as if they were not meant to be pressed. After a few months the mouse started to "ghost click" randomly making it nearly impossible to use. I cleaned it but it still persisted.On top of that don't even bother trying to go through Razer support to see about getting a repair/replacement as they have the worst customer service I have ever experienced.Save yourself the trouble and go with a different brand because this mouse is terribly made and a complete waste of money.
1,The right-click on all 3 mice were broken. There is a huge travel dead zone on the mice I bought each one with varying amounts of travel. As a gaming brand Razer knows such things are unacceptable in gaming mice. Needless to say after owning the 2014 Razer naga and using it until its scroll wheel tracking and feet broke. I will never support Razer again and I will advise all my friends to never purchase from a company that cannot manage even the most basic of quality control. I even bought 3 hoping the first 2 were a fluke.Read my review and save yourself the hassle. Go by a Logitech at least there mice work when you buy them...
2,fustrating device move at blinding speed need to create account to adjust try to log in and its looking for date of purchase which i know but it doesnt accept not allowing me to go further too much work for a gaming mouse made in tawian which i like
1,This is the 2nd of these I have used and both have started having issues within 6 months.  The left mouse button always starts having issues with double clicking.  In other words it will register 2 clicks when you only click once.  Also you have to press down hard when you want to hold and drag.  This is frustrating when playing a game or editing a photo.  For a $100 mouse these problems should not exist especially in less than 6 months.  2 brand new mice have the same problem in less than 6 months use.  The other features are nice but Razer needs to focus on the quality of the basic mouse functionality above all else.  I feel like I've wasted money because playing games (mainly MMOs) with this mouse is frustrating.
1,I am a long time logitech / corsair mouse user. I've probably used a mix of 25 to 30 mice over the past 20 years from these manufacturers. I've had failures after lengthy use certainly nothing less than 18 months. When I saw the concept of the Razer with the interchangeable side panels I was excited at the prospect of having 1 mouse that could be quickly converted for any game. I purchased it and have been using it for the last 6 months. Two days ago the 5 key on the 12 digit pad began to register intermittently. 24 hours later it's completely dead. I can say with confidence that I am not terribly hard on mice. I expect them to last considerably longer than 6 months. To make a long story short my first experience with Razer will be my last.
5,I bought this mouse because I liked the older model. No problems with it.
5,Good for all games that require quick switching hotkeys. Perfect for Minecraft.
5,100% recomendable
3,All buttons are ok except the left button which is very mushy. People use left button most frequently and the left button is the most important one. But from my experience most of the mice had mushy left button from the day one. Sigh
5,I have not found a single problem with the most itself yet. Does the razer synapse progress has problems so that shouldn't be blamed on the mouse. It's comfortable and customizable.
5,I love this for alot of things but remember you need to install the software for it to work the best
1,I literally plugged this into my computer and my whole system freaked out. It even cause my keyboard to stop working! I restarted my computer TWICE and as SOON as the mouse was plugged in the keyboard stopped typing. When I moved the mouse around the cursor would stop moving even though the mouse was at certain points too. I'm really tired of buying these $100 mice for my Final Fantasy XIV mmo when I dont even have these problems with a $15 regular one. I bought that Corsair schimitar or whatever mouse too years ago and those buttons didnt even work. I talked to Amazon's product support and asked if other people experienced the cursor problem and he said yes. YES??? YES?!?!?! If this is a known issue WHY ARE YOU STILL SELLING IT??!?!??!?! And at nearly full price at that!?!? This is ridiculous.
1,The mouse has great concept behind it but in my opinion fails due to the way its shaped. I feel scared to reposition it due the due to the possibility of accidently hitting buttons. For me as a person with smaller hands it does not feel comfortable in the slightest due to it not quite hitting either a claw or a palm grip and I just find myself more just resting my hand on it. The addition of the hex wheel and the 12 button side panel are great if it didn't seems so lose to be fair I bought it used (very-good condition) but the lighting disconnects from the panel and I can see that developing problems in the future. I wouldn't call it a bad mouse and if you like it power to you just definitely not the one for me.
2,This is an expensive mouse. A great one but expensive. My rabbit just decimated the cord a rare occurrence but it happens she'll go after cords "in her way." No replacement from support and I'm not eager to shell out that much money again
5,Great mouse
2,So I’ve been a using razor naga gaming mice for the past 5 or so years I bought a naga epic wireless mouse and loved it until the right click recently went out. So I purchased the trinity to replace it. I’ve had it for maybe 6mo now and the left click goes out. I’m disappointed in this product.
5,Great quality perfect for everyday use and of course GAMING.
5,Use this for work and play! Even have one at the office!
1,Mouse made it two years before I finally just threw it in the trash. Three months after purchase it started the double click no click problem I rectified this by putting new switches in it since the factory ones are garbage (does take soldering experience) but unfortunately the pads on the underside of the mouse are completely gone and it's going to apparently take an act of God to get Replacements from anybody because nobody seems to sell the pieces that fit this particular model only the 2014 model. So time to cut my losses and go with another company.
1,After only about 4-5 months after I began to use this mouse it began to have problems with double clicking after only clicking once as well as suddenly interrupting held clicks. I have taken very good care of this mouse no rage slamming or anything of the sort. The issue was also NOT fixed by blowing pressurized air into the mouse.This is terrible for a mouse that goes for such a high price. I've heard so many good things about Razer but this mouse is awful unless you are okay with buying a new one 2-3 times a year.
5,Great stuff so far we'll see how it holds up in 6 months.
5,It’s good enough
2,The 7 key and 11 are incredibly difficult to press. They got rid of the additional buttons by the scroll wheel and the the scroll wheel can no longer be mapped to the right or left.
5,Very responsive and easy to setup! Would recommend to anyone!
1,This is my third Razer mouse and was their last shot to impress me. 10 months after purchasing the mouse has developed a clicking problem where the sensor will sometimes trigger double clicks or fail to hold a mousedown action. This is a *very* common problem with this mouse and I have experienced double clicking issues with the previous 2 Razer mice as well. How many generations do you need to update the Naga before you find a solution Razer?In addition the Razer software over time gets bulkier with even worse User Interface choices. Setting up the mouse is not necessarily difficult but it is time consuming and the screens/dialogs are less than intuitive. With as many competitors as there are on the market I don't see this as a good value purely from the durability issues.
1,This mouse has so many hardware and software issues it’s not even funny. Will never buy another razer mouse again.
2,Like every Razer mouse I've ever owned the 12 side buttons become unresponsive within 6 months of use.  This time it was the #2 button that will not work unless the side panel is removed and placed back on.  It will then work properly for 15 minutes or so.  It's a shame Razer quality has fallen so drastically low because they have some of the best ergonomics and features.
2,This mouse feels great and performs well until it doesn't. I have been dealing with it double clicking for a few weeks now and thanks to it crapping out i accidentally sold a prize gun in tarkov for 9k... yes i was angry and now trying to replace under warranty. Corsair had issues with scroll wheel and now razr with the left click button. Any good mice out there?
1,bought this mouse new in 6 months it just stopped working.. tried updates and the synapse control center nothing..
5,My husband absolutely loves this... he tells everyone about his new mouse...
1,So I bought an $100 mouse and this was a horrible decision.  Synapse was non functional out of the box it took me over 3 hours to figure out get the program to even load. I get that working and now Synapse did not recognize that I had the razer mouse plugged in and thus would not let me configure it.  Cloud computing for drivers is a terrible idea.  Honestly the worst purchase I have ever made.Back to amazon it goes.
5,After buying this for myself my son wanted one exactly like it! I ordered him one for Christmas and he was excited and uses it daily!
2,ive had more issues with this mouse and the synapse software in 2 hrs than ive had with my old mouse in the last 7 years
5,Best mouse I've ever had. I use it to play World of Warcraft and it makes my life so much easier. The color effects are awesome too!
5,Perfect for every genre of gaming with the switchable side panels. Harder to get use to using than most mice however it is meant for true gaming.
1,Got the double clicking issue and for me it was my left clicking button.  This was after actually gaming much less on my PC than previously.  Spent the money on the Razer with my new gaming PC and definitely never going to get their products again.  I got less than an eighth of the life I did out of steel series mice.  Also the button sensitivity made the 12 button plate almost unusable.  Didn't fit actual adult sized hands in the slightest.
1,Much like everyone else I too am suffering from the double click issue.  The only reason I am writing this review is because I was looking at past purchase so that I could order a new one--then I saw that it hasnt even been a year since I purchased my Naga Trinity.In less than a year my left click has become a nightmare.  Guess it is time to open it up and hope for the best.  The pads on the bottom ( that cover the screws ) never really sit right after you pull them off.  Feels bad man.
5,Ergonomically functionally and loaded with features.  The Razer Trinity mouse is the acme of gaming mouses.
1,Update about 6 months later and the new one has started to have the same issues.  That is a total of 3 of the Razer naga hex/trinity.Have bought two now.  The first one had a problem with the laser not tracking the movement.  And now the new one I bought 6 months ago double clicks or wont click at times.Update:  Called amazon and let them know on the product.  They said they cant do anything about it and had to forward me to Razer customer service.  Thanks for not helping Amazon.  Then 20 minutes later trying to help Razer know the problem there step was reinstall Razer synapse.  But not listen to the problem at hand.  So no help from Amazon or Razer.
5,Love the customizability and color synch with other Razer products. It's a bit large and heavy but comfortable for hours of play.
2,This is supposed to have a 2 year warranty. But they are saying the warranty expired even though I have proof of purchase and date. Terrible customer service.
3,Good
2,I bought this mouse 8 months ago and the left mouse click doesn't work properly. Attempting to click and drag results in multiple rapid clicks. Don't buy this mouse.
1,There is a known issue with the left and right clicks on these mice. After having this mouse for 5 months the left click double clicks when not wanted and when trying to drag and drop it just drops when ever it wants. Razer states "Durable Mechanical Switches: Supports up to 50 million clicks backed by a 2 year warranty." good luck with that. Razer customer service is not the easiest people to work with if your product is out of Amazon's 30 day return. Razer has lost all of my business and I will let it be known.
5,Works great! I used it for mostly office admin typing like copy paste etc.
2,Not a bad mouse however it has the same weight as a factory provided mouse like you’d get with a store bought pc. Works fine but build quality for the cost just isn’t there.
5,My son loves this mouse for gaming!!  He was super happy!
5,Finally able to have my glowing purple mouse. I love the ease and ability of changing out the thumb buttons for regular use and my gaming use.
5,Best gaming mouse I’ve used so far. Definitely worth the cost.
5,I use this mouse for Elder Scrolls Online. Its It's perfect for MMO's and is of good quality. Haven't had any problems yet.
5,I play a lot league of legends and it works great
2,After a couple months of casual gaming use the number panel on the side has begun shutting off occasionally not connecting well magnetically I suppose. I have to press hard to reconnect it then it'll do it again eventually and unexpectedly. This has been my only problem with the mouse - one I think is significant. May only be a bad individual mouse among thousands that work perfectly fine. Just my issue with it.
1,If you don't know how/don't feel like repairing mouse switches just go buy a logitech G600 instead. This mouse is great until the warranty expires then it's just going to double click and screw you over while gaming.Pros:ErgonomicThe weight of the mouse is near perfectThe software is niceCons:The mouse will start double clicking when you only click once as soon as the warranty expiresVerdict:If you do buy this mouse just make sure you also order some quality mouse switches and know how to solder them onto the PCB.
5,I love it. If you ever want to see it used live go to twitch.tv and search QueenwithGuns
5,Great Christmas present for the teenager who has everything except a $70 computer mouse. He loves it and it functions with his dynamic keyboard
5,This mouse is the best mouse I’ve ever owned
2,I ran into a 'common' issue. After hours and hours of installing and reinstalling their cancerous software I found the side plates aren't detected when they're attached to the mouse. Razer support is STILL giving me the runaround 3 days later rather than sending me a working one. Save yourself the headache and just buy logitech. That was my last mouse and it lasted 9 years.
4,Muy buen producto
5,Exactly how I expected it. Works great and is comfortable for me.
5,If you play MMOs this mouse is simply a necessity. It will change how you game for better forever.
5,Overall perfect.
3,Turns off briefly randomly. Sometimes the whole mouse sometimes just the side panel.
5,Works as expected
1,Went through 2 of these mice after getting the 1st one replaced. They both lasted less than a year. The 1st one got the double clicking/no click issue and it would scroll down web pages by itself becoming completely unusable. The replacement got the double click/no click issue within 8 months. For a company that say they build for gamers their products are cheap garbage... Just go with Logitech at least they last and are like 1/3 the price
5,Been using it a while now and really like all the functions of the mouse.
1,I liked it for about a day. I hardly move my hand and the magnetic click-in on the mouse never seems to be in the right place. The buttons hardly ever work due to this. Certainly not reliable enough for any gaming. Do not recommend. It would be a lot nicer if the attachments were locked in place in any way.battery life is not even half of the claims.
1,The design for Razer equipment is top notch which is why they charge a premium price. But the internal workings of their equipment is absolute trash. Their support forums are RIDDLED with complaints about mice with "double-click" issues where you try to drag and drop or move your gaming screen and the mouse button won't hold. Razer support will not address the issue which is obviously a manufacturing flaw. Great mouse while it still works but it will stop working and Razer won't honor their warranty.
5,good quality!
1,I bought this mouse after having Razer products for years- always supposed to be top quality. The Synapse program they install with the mouse is clunky and freezes up which affects the performance of the peripherals. Today the left mouse button started to double click while holding and not always register a click when pressed. I contacted Razer support which led me through a lengthy troubleshooting session and then finally told me they'd replace it but I had to send my mouse back first. I asked what I was supposed to do buy another for the time it'd take for them to receive it and ship another one and the answer was "I'm afraid so." Going to do business with other companies from here out poor quality control and frustrating customer service.
5,Fantastic mouse hope it holds up like my last naga did!
1,This is the third Razer Naga I've owned. I had decided to stop buying them after the second one but my family picked this up for me as a Christmas present. As with the first two Naga's I owned the main mouse buttons have failed. Razer offered to replace it when I contacted them but I'm not willing to purchase another knowing I'll have to contact them in 8 to 12 months for a replacement. I don't recommend buying this model mouse especially when we have $14 dollar mouses we bought from Target that are nearly 10 years old and still work fine.
1,This is the absolute last thing I ever buy from this garbage company. I've had 3 mice die a keyboard and a headset all relatively quickly break or fully die on me. Overpriced garbage.
1,Been buying these mice for exclusively for several years. The quality has definitely fallen especially this new model. It's bulkier for whatever reason and feels frail. The side plates snap and work well.I can't recommend this for gaming because the last 3 I have purchased all double click the left mouse button. Not so much double click but there is a "minimum" pressure you must press down even after it has been "clicked". So you end up clicking twice very fast or clicking for only a millisecond then it stops pressing - Even though you have not "unclicked" it. Sorry for my bad explanation it doesn't sound like a deal breaker but trust me - It will get you killed and annoyed especially if you are competitive.
5,Love this mouse useful for every game I play and hotkeys also helped with smart phrasing at work
1,Purchased on April 11th 2019. Within a few months I began experiencing problems left clicking - the clicks would fail or release early. This has gotten progressively worse so that I can't even use it to highlight text much less play games with it. I have been forced to use a substitute until I hear back from the manufacturer. Google seems to indicate this is a known issue and has been unresolved by the manufacturer for some time.After 10 days of emails with customer service they promised a replacement. Those guys are the biggest "nice" jerks ever. Asked me 6 different ways if I had troubleshooted and isolated.Way too bad really because the idea of modular expansion buttons on the left side is fantastic.
1,Unfortunately I can't endorse Razer at all.  I have owned their products through the years and none of them stand the test of time at all.  This Naga Trinity will be my 5th Razer Naga I have owned in the past 7 years or so.  I have a running joke on myself where I have put all of the Razer stickers I have collected from ordering the mice on the side of my gaming PC.  2 each thus far I have 10 stickers.  The only reason I continue to purchase them is I am so used to using the mouse at this point that everything else feels off.  I advise customers to look elsewhere if you haven't become acclimated to their products.
5,Feels really goodand really easy to switch through the different side options.
2,It's a good heavy comfortable mouse and being able to program it with Razer Synapse and swap out the side button configurations on the fly is incredibly convenient but the left mouse button is having problems after only a couple of months of use. It frequently inputs two mouse clicks when only clicking once. I'd expect something like that from a cheap department store mouse. My old Razer Naga 12 button mouse lasted for 3 years or more before it started having that issue.
5,I have been using the NAGA line since 2011. Every model gets better and better! If you play several games requiring extra buttons I strongly suggest this mouse.
2,This being the second trinity mouse I've owned having returned the last one since I chalked up the heavy wheel to it being refurbished I've been extremely disappointed with the heavy scroll wheel resistance. Despite being brand new the feel of the wheel seems unnaturally strong when previous models had perfect softness. I have absolutely no clue if Razer intended it to be this way so until then will keep up my 2/5 review since it happens to be one of the most essential parts of using a computer for me.
2,I love the Naga design but sadly the left mouse button has degraded after only 5 months and doesn't work on every press. I've read this is a consistent problem with Razer mouses and wont be buying another one.
2,Love the feeling of the mouse love swapping the side buttons but I'm 6 months from purchase and I have the double or no click issue. I can't recommend this mouse until a very common concern is no longer present.
5,Great mouse. Switching plates is easy and the custom lighting is amazing
5,I swap from a Naga to this and the change was noticeable. This feel more pro and I really enjoy play with it.
5,Works great. Second purchase after 5 years.
5,Mejor mouse precisión al 100% muy cómodo rápido lo volvería a comprar es de los mejores en el mercado.
2,The 12 key grip has a 5 second lag between when you press it and the button goes through unless if it's default. In other words you can't change the keybind if you want it to work properly
5,It is good for LoL and porn
5,One of the best mouse for gaming.  Easy to change side templates and very reactive
1,This money grabbing product is trash.  Instead of letting us buy what we want we have to buy this crap with interchangeable plates.  It worked great out of the box and literally the very next day 3 of the 7 buttons stopped working.  Turned out the connectors on the mouse were stuck and not making contact to the plate.Soon as I find an alternative to the 7 button circle formation I'll be returning this crap.  This is my 5th Razer product and not one has lasted more than 3-4 years.Update:  Double Click problem just like every Razr mouse after a few months.
1,I own two of these mice and both of them have issues with the left and right buttons not holding a click properly. The first lasted a year and the second only three months. This problem makes it impossible to reliably click and drag in games and other software. Those buttons will also sometimes multi-click which can cause unwanted double clicks and other undesirable results. Customer service seemed like they were going to help me out but then never sent the shipping label they promised despite multiple contacts informing them that I had not received it. If you want a reliable device look elsewhere. I hate saying this because I have been a fan of Razer products for two decades. I played Quake with an original Boomslang.
2,I've had this mouse for like 6+ months. I love this mouse and all but I recently came across this issue where the left click is registering double clicks for some reason. Through some research I find that this is a common occurrence. I feel like Razer really needs to step up their game and figure out how to prevent their mice from doing this. I really wanna recommend it but at the end of the day I really wish I bought something else.
3,It's a bit small for me to grip comfortably being a tall guy with big hands but still serviceable and i do like it.
5,Very responsive and adjustable gaming mouse. Wish I had bought a year ago now but glad to have it today.
1,I been using razer products for over 10 years keyboards and headphones are great and durable (To some extent) but the mouse products I've been replacing forever.. they're very faulty and undurable. over 3 months use the mouse started to show errors and glitches in usage while gaming.and yesterday after 5 months use it just stopped working for good.The one (wireless Naga) before it was the same started with the side buttons stopping function and then the scroller as well.Very disappointed and will be shifting to another brand after 10 years brand loyalty.
2,Great mouse really do like it but after 2 months it just stopped working . Thankfully its still in warranty but still its like a hit or miss with these mouses.
1,Did not realize how common my issue was until I google searched it. Many other people are having the same issue which is that the left click either double clicks or hold clicks after a single click. My issue came up after only 6 month of use. Would not recommend this specifically because of this issue otherwise it was a very good mouse and I really liked the side buttons. For it to have such a common problem makes this product a 1 star.
5,Best mouse out there. Have been using it for years and it's great!
5,Had the Naga chroma for a 1 year with a defect razer sent me the Naga trinity liked it so much I bought 2 more for gaming buddies!
1,I don't leave reviews often so this says a lot. From the getgo this mouse (I have owned it for now one day) had issues. Getting the computer to realize it was plugged in and now with the lights. They are now flickering as if it's some kind of disco party as we speak. Before the flickering it was failing at getting the side / Thumb button lights to work. I won't return this because I don't want to get eventually banned from amazon for multiple returns
2,Loved this mouse for about two months now the right and left buttons catch and the #3 side button is worn out.The original hex version was much better.Please build a better version of this mouse.
1,Wireless hasn’t ever worked with the mouse. Thought oh well I’m fine using the wire. I’ve had the mouse for ~3 months now and the buttons on the side of the mouse get stuck and a lot of the time others do not even register that I’m pressing them..Save your money and buy a different brand of mmo mouse
1,Left click started randomly ghost clicking and double clicking after less than 1 year of normal use.Razer support is going to be replacing the unit however it should be noticed that even with their very obvious templates for responses they were still ridden with spelling and grammatical errors. Response times for online tickets typically a minimum of 48 hours their phone system is so busy that they are refusing inbound calls.It is very painfully obvious Razer has sold out to quantity over quality and the customer experience is down the drain. I'll be going with Logitech for future hardware purchases.
1,Please do not buy this product or any Razer product.  Something they won't tell you before you buy their products is that you have to install their software to get it to work right.  However their software is the buggiest mess I've ever seen.  The worst part? You HAVE to be able to connect to their servers to log in to be able to use your locally installed software on your PC.  The issue with that is their servers have issues ALL THE TIME.  If they are having issues guess what? Your product won't work right.  Their customer support is also nearly useless they will give you the run-around and blame everything except their product for anything that goes wrong.
1,Will eventually develop double-clicking which prevents you from highlighting dragging copying etc. I use this mostly for work and without these features its essentially broken. Razer's app says that my device is still under warranty but the link to get help directs to the website which says the device is not under warranty and won't even provide me an email or chat box to get help. Would suggest avoiding this brand entirely due to the poor customer support if anything ever breaks.
5,Both my boys love this mouse for gaming!
2,This mouse worked great while it was actually working but started double (and even triple!) clicking with every press. It sucks that such an expensive mouse would stop working after only a couple of months of use.
5,One of the best buys ive ever made.
5,Very good
2,This product is a pretty good mouse but you can't ignore the double clicking issue. I'm going back to my old Razer Naga Chroma that has yet to have a double click and probably going to use that until its completely dead. Don't buy this mouse please.
1,i used a razer naga mouse for years bought several as they tend to wear out after a year or two. upon buying the newest version i will never buy a razer naga again. It sucks. the customization options are crap. they dont sinc up well and you lose access to your buttons 40%  plus of the time you try playing.  only one of the three button options worked at least 80% of the time and it was the setup i liked the least. this product and company just makes me very sad as they had a great top of the line product and ruined it with 'innovation'.  dont recommend save your money and buy something else.
5,looks great flexible side panels quick good for gaming
1,I will never again a product from Razor. Amazon was amazing in that we were able to send back a defective product within the time frame but Razor has a 2 year warranty outside of Amazon. 1 month. It took 1 month to hear anything back from Razor and they closed the case before it was actually settled.The mouse will double triple or quadruple click without warning and the only way to fix it is the remove the side panel and put it back on. Two mice same issue. Spend your money somewhere else.
5,This is the first time I’ve used this type of mouse and I love it. Very easy setup and fun!
2,This is my 3rd Razer mouse and right click stops working or double clicks. Sure there is some quality issue with Razer mice. I will switch to another brand.
2,I have lowered my review to 2 stars. While it started off as a great gaming mouse after only 7 months it has stopped working. The left click button no longer responds. Unfortunate. For the price of it one would expect it to last longer than 7 months.
5,Product was as expected very smooth
1,mice comfortability is defintely good as with all razer products. biggest issue i have it the battery lasted me 6 hours forcing you to leave it plugged in. but while youre using it plugged in it literally takes the entire day to charge. it defeats the whole purpose of a wireless mouse if you have to keep it plugged in all day. also your DPI changes everytime you unplug/plug it in forcing you to change it everytime. and when you use bluetooth mode for some reason the polling rate (hz) changes and it feels very jumpy
5,Love the interchangeable buttons on the side. Works for all games.
5,Great mouse.  Changing sides is very easy and makes for simple game changes
5,probably the best mouse for Fortnite
5,the attachments make the game more flexible. it makes playing the game easier.
5,For gaming on FPS games and RPGs
5,Items just as described arrived on time. Thank you!
5,5/5 as you would expect from Razer :)
5,Love itI love it friking best best gaming mouse better than the logitech 502 and elite momba
5,Already knew it was a good product but didn't realize the wait and size till it arrived. Extremely satisfied with buy.
1,The mouse is peeling off after 6 months on the grid and the resulting surface feel really bad in the contact. Razer support says it’s normal use. This is the first time it happeneds something like that after 15+ years of gaming with Logitech mouses.. and i just upgraded because it was time. Now after 6 months I need to figure out a way to live with this bad surface sticky feeling or change the mouse…
5,boyfriend is happy
5,Useful and cheaper than buying a version with just one button layout. U get 3 for cheaper than 1
5,Typical Razer quality.  Everything works as advertised.  No unexpected issues.  Great product.  Would buy again.
5,It was not too big or too small. I like the different panels and its great overall
2,After two weeks of moderate gaming the right click was sticking or not working. This used to be a great mouse before they changed whatever they did. FIGURE IT OUT RAZER!
5,Been using a naga for years my 2012 model finally started acting up. Same great product with some minor tweaks.
1,This mouse freezes a lot while you're using it. I have it on 2.4 GHz and it's constantly freezing for 3-4 seconds and then it restarts. It's super annoying in productivity tasks and I wouldn't trust it for gaming at all.
5,Excellent Item and Excellent Seller A++
5,side panel funtaionattly is very good for games
5,3 side panels add great diversity for any game or project. Fits firmly in hand very comfortable.
2,This mouse was great for nearly 10 months then out of nowhere it started not registering the left and right clicks at random and will act as though I have let go of the left and right clicks when it is still pressed. Also their customer service is bad.
1,after a week of use the led light stopped working seat it back over a week ago and still waiting for a refund
1,I like to use the Razer Naga. I have used it for a very long time. My original Naga lasted 5 or 6 years. Eventually things wear down. No problem I'll get another one. And another... and another. As always a company like this becomes successful with quality products. Then they go after profits instead of longterm stability and quality goes down. Nowadays a Naga lasts less than 6 months for me. I go through about 2 a year because usually the buttons on the side stop working or the mouse wheel or mouse buttons 4 and 5 behind the mousewheel stop working. The keypad is wonderful and I love it but the durability of the mouse is horrendous.
5,Best mouse I have had.  Worth the $.
1,I've spent time tinkering with the options.. I cannot get wireless (2.4ghz) to work in a viable way for gamingConstantly stops and glitches out. Just get a $30 non gaming mouseWired is great thoughLowered to a 1 just because of how completely broken it is even for basic daily tasks when in wireless mode.Absolute trash for anything non-wired seriously I'm pretty surprised as Razor has been good to me in general
2,mouse just came today changed tested  out the 12 keypad  side plate doesn't fully register all keypads i have to put more pressure on  the key's to make it work  was expecting a great quality from Razer as my old 2014 naga lasted me 3-4years poorly made
3,Good for some playthrough but not long sessions The  one with 9 btns have no way to rest the thumb and provoke lots of miss clicks
1,After a year developed the same double click issue you've been hearing about. The old style were bulletproof these not so much. Cutting cost left and right when compared side by side. For the first time in 8 years I'm going to try another brand. This mouse is comfort and performance-wise so fantastic compared to others but this issue is going to ruin the once gold standard reputation this model had.**Update***After about a month of contacting their support(which is decent) I received an RMA replacement and almost exactly a month later developed the same double clicking issue. Contacting their support again to see what happens.
5,I pretty much exclusively use the two-button side panel but I haven't had any problems with it.
1,Mouse was good for about a month.I play WoW and the 12 buttons on the side started getting stuck and misfiring.When I took off the side I see the pins on the inside actually getting stuck down.. that's what I figured was causing the buttons that I hit to not go off.. it was the inside pins that were getting pressed and not coming back up.Obviously this is very frustrating when I'm smashing a button and its not going off till my 5th try.. LOLI've had Razer mice in the past but this is by far my worst experience.As a gamer.. I would not recommend this mouse to anyone.
1,Nice mouse but the point of getting a mouse of this caliber is Macros.  As shown on the screenshot the Macros part of the software does not work.  Razer support tells me their recommended resolution is to either have an additional PC to try to reproduce this on or to reinstall the OS on my new (7month old) Dell gaming tower.Buy this if you want to roll the dice on whether Macros will work on your PC because Razer support won't help you.
5,This mouse feels so good I love it. My naga progiles do not transfer had to redo everything.
1,I have now had 4 of these and they all experience the exact same issue the left/right click buttons either sticking not working at all or stutter when long holding(aiming down sights). I originally thought it was me traveling with them to and from work every day in my Alienware backpack but I got to the point of having two one at work and one at home to try and limit it getting smashed in the travel. But alas the new one I bought recently has started to fail as the others have done. No longer going to invest in these pieces of trash any more.
1,After maybe six months of use it started failing the left click will either not detect a click or it will release when I have the button held down. It's become more and more of a problem ever since then.Which sucks because otherwise it's a good mouse.This apparently isn't uncommon so I can only assume that it's deliberate. The button stops working but you're otherwise happy with it so you just buy another and another.
5,Great for mmos ff14 and classic wow
1,Razer Naga used to be the best gaming mouse available but Razer for some unknown reason decided to no longer support Macs.  The mouse is now worthless to Mac owners that are stuck with this piece of junk.
1,I thought I'd be able to hold out and diagnose the issues with the mouse dropping inputs and making my games drop frames or lag while the mouse software ran in the background... but after trying everything and contacting support 2-3 times nothing seemed to work. I love the mouse in concept and was excited about the interchangeable plates but I'll probably never find myself using it and missed being able to return it for a refund... definitely disappointed overall.
5,Got it 3 days before classic haven’t put it down since
5,I got this used and it feels brand new. I don't have any problems with it yet.
5,No better mouse for MMORPGs in the market when it comes to key bindings.
2,Buttons started sticking or not working within a year just like the naga before that. The first one I had was 2012 version which lasted 6 years and through a lot of WoW and I definitely got my million+ clicks out of that. Recent models however seem to be lacking that quality.
2,A year after purchase left click would not function properly. Holding down left click would occasionally press then release even though I was still holding down. 2 years later now and holding left click does nothing at all.
1,I was exited for this mouse because of the versatility of the different side panels however f you try to hold down the mouse button (for example to aim downsights in a FPS) it will not hold and will instead click multiple times at random intervals. Razer build quality has been garbage since they went public; on their mice headsets and probably everything else.
5,Top quality mouse for gaming I use it for ESO and it lets me easily set hit keys.
5,Works well and can change the side keys better play your way with your gear
5,The magnetic points holding the side panel options are strong and will not wiggle once fully seated into the mouse
5,hex on this is amazing..literally dont use any button on my keyboard besides wasd f and x
5,Best mouse I’ve ever used for gaming.
1,I had the Razer Naga Molten Edition for almost 5 years worked flawlessly. Six months in this mouse had started with its left-click issues. It will release the left-click when holding down and double click frequently. Disappointing considering how well the old mouse lasted.
5,Extremely satisfied. Bought as a replacement for my old gaming mouse and it feels amazing to use
1,I paid almost $100 for this mouse just got it yesterday. For that amount of money I would hope the most important button the left mouse clicker would at least work at all. Every few clicks the mouse continues to click rapidly for a few seconds. The main function of the mouse should be the most solid part; I'll be returning it do not recommend.
5,Bought as a replacement for my 2014 Razer Naga. Definitely a worthwhile purchase. Would highly recommend.
2,I enjoy Razer products for the most part however this is the second time now where the left click on the mouse has gone out or is faulty only a few months after purchase. Will not happen a third time.
5,I love razer goods
1,The mouse seems to be a good mouse but mine came in with a 2.4 usb for it which i am very disappointed.
5,Been a fan of Razer for a while now and this didn't dissapoint well made and confortable.
5,Calidad
1,Right mouse button stopped working after 9 months. The last MMO mouse I had UtechSmart Venus which is a $35 Chinese mouse lasted 4 years and even then only had a bit of a strange feeling on the wheel click still worked. The poor quality along with the terrible Synapse software means I will avoid Razer at all costs from now on
5,It is easy you can change the sides super easy but it is a little confusing to set up
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I had purchased this mouse exclusivy to use the wireless function and within a month the wireless was acting up. My mouse would not hold a charge and I could only use it in wired mode. I had contacted RAZER about the issue and filed an RMA request with them I sent the mouse to them and they never sent me a replacement.
1,The only logic one that I can find is that they don't use the product that they make. Do a simple test take the old Naga Hex V2 and now use the Naga Trinity and you'll see - @Razer you well know where are the issues if you decided to fix them I'll return to this brand - right now I can't find another reason to keep paying for this.Make Razer Great Again - and let me know now let me see what else I should buy (Corsair Logitech or something else)
5,I got used to using this quickly and it's great for Wow & FF14. Seems well made and durable.
5,Fast and easy!  Great mouse.
1,I purchased this mouse to replace a Razer Naga I had for three years.  Plugged in the new mouse and downloaded the appropriate software to map buttons and macros.  The mouse worked amazingly well.  Responsive and on point.  Few weeks later it started to feel a little sluggish.  Now I press buttons and it acts as if they are not making contact.  Very sporadic in responses.  I use this mouse for gaming and the right mouse button just randomly chooses to not function.
5,Best mouse I ever had
1,The software part of this RAZER brand is a REAL PAIN IN THE NECK: the lighting does not work consistently. It works fine on my six year old system -most of the time- but on my new system I just built the lighting on the mouse and keyboard does not work. The lighting only works on the gamepad. I can't return the RAZER keyboard gamepad and mouse as the  day return window is closed but I would not advise to buy the RAZER brand to my worst enemy-or maybe-
1,Amazing mouse until the wireless stopped working. After about 3 months the mouse started to freeze in place for about a second a few times a minute making it literally worthless for gaming. The workaround is too keep it plugged in but then why did I buy a wireless mouse? Usually a fan of razer but I'm this one I can see where they get their reputation for garbage peripherals.
1,Razer for ages has had a poor version of their Synapse software "working" on Macs but with the Big Sur updates the OS can no longer run it. Their next version has only ever run on Windows (it appears to still be a "Beta" too after 4 years ha) and they won't release a version for Macs.So you'll have a half-running piece of hardware on a machine they don't support. If they company says here in any way that they support Macs they do not.
2,Seemed to have double click issues almost out of the box. Really disappointing that Razer doesn't offer their optical switch in a cheaper wired version of this mouse
1,If you have older Razer devices do not buy this product! It requires Razer synapse 3.0 to run however most older devices will not run on synapse 2.0. So your options are replace totally fine equipment (I see what you did there Razer) or to run both clunky software packages simultaneously and deal with the constant parade of bugs.This has been a known issue since 2017 now and Razer has still not fixed it. Upgrade your mouse lose your keyboard and headset... great deal!As a side note this mouse is way larger than the previous Naga models and a difficult transition from my old Naga MMO mouse which was great.
5,I splooged my pants when I unboxed this razer naga mouse. 3 changeable plates is awesome. Best mouse I've ever owned
1,Mouse double clicks every time I single click.  Also using a razor mouse pad I have tracking issues at high DPI.  I cant even move windows around on my PC with it. Blowing on the front buttons it helps for about 5 mins. So its some type of static charge making it do the second click.  Mouse made me rage till I smashed it with a hammer so i would never have to look at it again. Jokes on me I'm still finding bits of plastic everywhere.
1,I'm a WOW raider and Mythic+ runner and u are gonna know how frustrated I could be when every single key on that side panel stopped working I pay 150 dollars for u to work otherwise what's the point? Razer? Hello? gonna try to fix it on my own and if not just gonna instant refund. Razer nice job proud of u
5,The weight and balance are excellent. The magnetic swappable side panels are genius. This is far and away the best mouse I've ever used.
1,After 3 months of owning the mouse I noticed that it was starting to double click in some of the games I was playing. It wasn't a big deal because the double click didn't bother me too much. Around 10 months of owning the mouse it became unbearable. Buy a different mouse. I know someone else with the exact same issue I am having. It's not worth it IMO.
2,Worked great for a short time then started to stop responding and the software caused lag issues.  Would not recommend this purchase.  The price does not match the quality.
3,This product is listed as universal. However if you want to configure the buttons the software is PC only. Worked fine as a 3-button mouse.
1,Had to return. Mouse does not work
5,I've been using razer mice for years now.  Love them.
1,Installed latest drivers researched forum posts to resolve. Nothing helps. The mouse freezes several times throughout the hour for a few seconds then resumes the light remains on so its not disconnected from USB. Super frustrating when you are trying to do something the mouse just randomly freezes how crazy is that? I've had cheap mouses never do that to me! My latest solution? Bang the mouse a few times though I think its more for my own sanity and for hating the mouse.Extremely dissapointed had high hopes for the mouse; but its completely failed on the very basic functionality of just moving the pointer.
5,I really love this mose my money is well spent and i dont regret buying it
5,Best mouse money can buy.
1,Loved the mouse when I first got it.  Was able to create macros for games and what not.  After a few months of normal gaming use the left click stopped registering correctly.  It would loose connection in the middle of click and drag.  It would sometimes register as a double click when you click once.  Sometimes when you click and hold it would act as a single click and release.  Would not recommend to any friend or family.  Better off with a generic mouse then this one.
5,Nice mouse for 3D modeling
5,Fast shipping
2,The hot-swappable side panels are a cool and useful feature but unfortunately this mouse has started double clicking after about 2.5 months of use.  The search continues for a mouse that isn't trash.
2,It’s a very wide mouse and just feels huge for my small hands. Returned it so unable to comment on the rest of it.
5,It is a good product
5,First gaming mouse ive bought had it for 6 months and its still amazing
1,I used three Razer Naga Hex (MOBA) mice in the span of 7 years.  My last one lasted 3 years before a replacement.  I got this Naga Trinity since it appears Razer no longer sells mice with a 6-button sidepanel.  I miss the Hex.  This new mouse feels cheap.  Within two weeks I'm already experiencing a double-click issue.  Sometimes a side panel button "sticks" and you have to click it again to stop it.  The scroll-wheel feels loose and floppy and sounds like go-kart engine.  Definitely not happy.  1 outta 5.
1,Got this product.  installed easily.  Seemed like it worked well.  It said i needed firmware update. updated firmware.....  afterwich time the wireless no longer worked.Googled the issue come to find out its been happening since day 1 and all Naga offers to do is RMA it.  How about fixing the firmware issue?WOULD NOT BUY!
5,Perfect gift for my brother.
5,My son loves this product the flexibility of it makes it easy for him to set it up for different games.
1,Looks cool but not as functional as it should be.  Not great for gaming as the mouse freezes up from time to time and that gets you Killed in a game. From reading about this on the message boards Razer knows about the issue but isn't doing anything to resolve it.  It's too bad I love the features and added buttons but I might be looking for a new mouse.
5,The product is as described and works as you would expect from a top manufacturer.
5,Very nice mouse. It was only after shipping that it was found to be cheaper.
1,FYI Razer mice software synapse is no longer available for the mac os. The last synapse driver available for the mac does not support this mice. The mice works fine you just have no way to program any of the buttons. Be nice if they mention this fact before purchasing. 1 star for the trouble.
5,Perfect. Ryzer rules!!!
5,Bought this for my husband who games a lot . No complaints regarding the product
5,It's a great mouse was purchased as a birthday present but the user needed a ambidextrous mouse.
1,Getting the double clicking problem and can't properly move cameras in games like WoW or FPS games. When holding the right click and moving the camera it randomly "stops holding the click" even if you never lift your finger so then the camera stops moving. Then it catches up and starts clicking again as you continue to hold it and end up clicking something you didn't want to click on screen. Terrible design. The older Naga never had this issue. The Trinity is bad and all of the incoming reviews after a year or two of being out prove it.
5,Perfect condition.  Fast delivery. Exactly as described.
1,I couldn't be more disappointed in this expensive mouse. The original Naga was my absolute favorite; however it got to the point where left click was double-triple clicking randomly after many years so I figured I'd try the successor. This thing is awful. The wheel sticks. It's bigger and doesn't fit my hand as well. It's missing the forward and backward buttons near the upper left that make internet browsing better...Honestly I'm gonna try a knock-off from an off-brand because this thing is a downgrade in nearly every way to the original. I almost never write reviews but this is just such a frustrating purchase.
5,I used for moba and FPS games and it works great
5,got it to replace my old razer naga molten edition was reluctant at first but loving it so far
5,Can’t say anything else it’s Razer so it’s definitely worth it <3
1,Beware the high star reviews on this product - it's misleading because at first it really is a fantastic mouse but you quickly realize it deteriorates insanely fast. After the first month I had already gotten some mild clicking issues but through some work arounds managed to get over it - but then after month 3 it became almost impossible to do anything due to double clicks or not clicking at all.
5,Great mouse
2,One of the buttons doesn't work well. It was bad as soon as I opened the box. I hoped it would get better with some use but it hasn't.
5,Very comfortable to use.
5,best mouse for mmorpg
5,Mouse is solid and still getting used to the feel
2,The buttons worked for a while. If i removed the button plate and replaced it the buttons would start working again. That no longer works. I have to permanently deal without some buttons working. My old Naga works better to this day. If you have buttons randomly stop working here and there return immediately.
5,Fast delivery nice price. The seller is good I recommend
1,Worked fine for four months then randomly stopped working a few times and now only works for a split second when plugged in.  Tested on multiple machines.Nice mouse while it lasted.  The side keys are a nice addition for a lot of games but the two Logitech G600s I've owned offer the same for less than half the price and function for years.
1,Purchased 2 1 for myself 1 for a friend for Christmas. Less than 4 months both were broken. We both started getting the ghosty clicks. Clicking sometimes worked would randomly stop working mid click. Really dumb and frustrating as it can be hard to narrow down when playing a game what is going on. Hold down to fire a gun haha you thought you had an auto it's a sporadic semi auto now sucka!!
1,I have had this mouse for about 10 months and I am already requesting my second replacement due to erratic Left Mouse button click behavior. I have never RMA's a mouse prior to owning a Razor you can also find forums of people complaining about this defect but even though the vendor is aware they still send me a defect replacement the first time. This time I am going to play it smart...I am going to sell the replacement online and go to a better quality mouse.
5,This product is very high quality
5,Love the mouse. Hate the software.
5,Muy bueno este mouse puedo configurar macros excelente
3,Needs a wireless version
5,Works as intended and companion software is easy to use and understand.  Highly recommended product.
5,Very nice mouse with a lot of versitility. Good control and weight. Settings are fairly easy to figure out.
1,Edit: i have now bought 3 of these mice (im stubborn and like the circle button setup on the side) ive had all 3 fail one of which failed in less than a month. unless you want to throw a lot of money at a mouse avoid this onethis mouse has received SUPER light use over 6 months and has already started double clicking everything. i sometimes have to click something 5-6 times to get it to do a single click and forget about trying to drag and drop something with it. this mouse has officially been out lasted by a $5 walmart cheapo mouse. what a joke.
3,The plastic grip came out in the base set of the 3 interchangable pieces.
5,I love this mouse it is definitely worth the price
1,I have owned a razer blade 2017 laptop and the naga. After having their products for multiple years I can't say I will ever purchase another of their products again. The lack of quality control and support for these products has been terrible. Save yourself some money and get the Logitech alternative instead.
5,Great gaming mouse
1,I bought this mouse two months ago in that time I had to get used to a few different buttons just not working when i pressed them unless i pressed them multiple times. It reached a point where the reason I bought the mouse wasn't working at all. I tried researching online for this problem and all the solutions i was given have not worked. I ended up having to buy a new mouse that actually did what was advertised just to have a functioning mouse. I am taking this as a sign that Razer has so diminished in quality that I will be moving to a different provider for my peripherals.
5,Amazing buy
1,I have used Nagas for gaming for years and used to love them.  Its comfortable and easy to use.  I have never had any complaints until now.  The buttons on the side randomly quit working and since I almost exclusively use these buttons it's a huge problem when I'm gaming. The only fix I have found is removing the side panel sometimes several times before the mouse works properly.  This tends to happen in raids so it has caused me a lot of issues.  I will not be buying another naga in the future.  I would not recommend this product.
5,Amazing product wish it had more lighting options but that's a superficial complaint.
2,Bought the mouse July 2019 and the right click on the thing is starting to give out. What gives Razer? Why can't you guys just use half way decent switches in your premium priced products that are apparently built with no better quality than a $10 budget mouse?
1,Double click is consistently a problem in razor's mouse. It's everywhere on the internet. Razor never fixed the problem.When you contact razor CS they will teach you to blow your mouse to fix the problem. The first blow's effect will last several days after that you have to blow more often. After a couple of times you have to blow it hourly to fix the problem.Imaging using this mouse and doing the presentations on Zoom you have to blow your mouse to continue.
5,Amazing mouse
2,I've owned several of the Naga series. I took a break and went Corsair and regretted it. Tried this and I like everything about it except mine was defective out the gate. Would not stop disconnecting.
5,Razer never disappoints.  This product is great
5,Great mouse ....
5,Saved over $30 dollars by ordering this from Amazon. Love the mouse.
5,hot swapping the thumb panels helps tremendously when gaming or working
2,The buttons on the side do not work half the time. U have to separate side button part and snap back on. Idk it does this but I would avoid this mouse. The previous naga was way better.
5,Perfect
3,The whole line of numbers in the middle of the 12 number button pad doesn't work for me at all.
1,either this was completely defective or this mouse was posseted.  would not stop typing number #7 REPEDEDLY.  to point computer almost froze NUMERIOUS times.  took me about 15 mins of complete WTF to realize it was the mouse.  another 2 hour spent trying to fix.  My review is - 12 and id recommend a 5$ commuter mouse over this mouse...HANDS DOWN..  complete crap
1,Probably a faulty unit but very disappointed since it cost me $79.99. The metal cntacts or even wiring within the mouse must be faulty because the buttons and lighting constantly goes on and off every time I click buttons.I own 2 other Naga models (the original and the wireless one) and the Trinity is by far the worst out of the three. They should have stuck with the classic numeric button panel instead of making these interchangeable parts that just add a many points of failure to the design. I might be looking else where for a mouse now.
1,Here is the deal: The buttons are really small and close together. That being said unless you have small hands you are not going to reach the 7 8 9 10 11 12 keys very easily. I literally can't even reach the last row and my hands are pretty average sized. The mouse is pretty heavy so changing you grip to accomidate the buttons can be really challenging. LAST BUT REALLY IMPORTANT: They are the 1-9 keys on your keyboard not 12 SEPARATE programmable keys. In other words you aren't getting 12 new programmable buttons you're getting three. And you can't even reach them. Very sad to see the product so poorly designed and thought out....
2,Loaded with cool features but dang is it fat. In previous modules you could change the grip size to fit your hand and unfortunately they've gone away from that for this model. It's huge. It's heavy. It doesn't fit my hand at all and I already miss my old razer Naga from 2011.
1,I've had 3 razers nagas epics etc that I've loved and over used and this one just sucks.  It makes my hand cramp and what is supposed to be a convenience of having the numbered button panel on the side is terrible in my opinion.  The buttons stick out so far (my previous mouse buttons did not stick out as far and were smooth) and its too big for my hand.  Its not made like the previous models.  This would be best for someone with larger hands (I'm 5'2").  The functionality of it is good though and lights up great.
5,Im happy with it it performs it job well
2,Definitely not for women or people with small hands. I bought one for WoW. Had to abandon it after several uses. Heard about the older version is better for people with small hands.Although the material is good and easy to switch the side buttons. Easy installment of the software.
5,Son loves it
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY i had this mouse for 5 months and both the left and right mouse buttons stopped working no replacement from amazon and they wanted me to return it for a refund an which who knows how long i would have to wait for a new mouse since its not like there is a micro center in the state im living in and i will never go to best buy. Stop buying razer products as they are trash just like amazon!
1,The mouse left click button stopped functioning correctly after only a 3 months. It will still work sometimes if I click very softy which makes trying to click and drag something very difficult. It also would randomly cause issues with keybinding. Clicking would sometimes cause it to enter the D key repeatedly until I either unplugged the mouse or restarted my computer. Overall very poor quality from what is supposed to be a reputable gaming company.
1,This mouse fit the exact criteria I was looking for in a mouse but it didnt even last 6 months.Pros: The switchable side panel worked perfectly for all the games i play wow tarkov rust etc. software is fantastic for customization of color formation smooth ergonomic design.Cons: the main right click for this mouse broke before 6 months of use. So sad. I have been pc gaming for 15 years was  strictly logitech until the mamba then i needed a more dynamic mouse for wow. Was enjoying it so much till this happened. Can't cheap out on your product.
1,I really liked the mouse on arrival the features and variety are nice. Unfortunately the scroll wheel broke after only 3.5 months of use. Which IMO makes it fall extremely short of being "Worth the price..." I would think a company as big as Razer would use much better parts in their products.I'm disappointed for sure.
2,This is my 3rd Naga and the only one I've hated. My original was eaten by my cats recently so needed a new one. The Epic was also great. This one will be only for a backup.
5,Absolutley love it!
1,After 6 months the left click is broken. Such an easy thing to prevent. What a disappointment....
1,The nose itself is great. Great solid feel like most Razer products. Buttons have a good tactile feel. Interchangeable plates aren’t loose and don’t rattle. Tracking is good. The only problem is and it’s a major problem is that you REQUIRE Razer Synapse 3 to use it.  Synapse 3 is STILL in Beta after over a year later. Synapse 2 won’t even recognize your devices. A few minutes after installation my laptop had non-stop random key presses of multiple different buttons; including the windows button and “E” so my laptop had dozens of File Explorer windows opening up. I recommend not purchasing until they finally figure out Synapse 3.
3,Very nice mouse but if you change your side plate everyday i dont reccoment.
1,when it worked it was great I got to have a 12 button mouse for the MMOs I play. now only the wheel only lights up and nothing else works.
1,I bought this product in June.  It is now November and the product no longer works.  Clicking the left or right mouse button will randomly cause either no click at all or multiple clicks in a row.  After multiple firmware updates and troubleshooting online the problem seems to be mechanical.  As this is outside of the Amazon return policy I'm now stuck with a dead product.Save yourself $100.  Buy a different company's product.
1,I've gone through so many of these mice not sure what happened but somewhere down the line Razer stopped caring about quality? Not sure either way save your money and go pick up a Logitech or something. These are overpriced trash that WILL go bad.
1,For a product I dumped a lot of money into is really buggy. Really frustrating seeing you mouse cursor not respond and freeze. I've gone thought the forums and it requires a lot of troubleshooting that on my side failed and it's not worth tbh. I have bought many razor products but so far all their products suck excluding their keyboards.
1,Mouse design is similar to the normal naga family. The quality of the mouse is a $20 mouse. Entire mouse is plastic. Buttons and Visual  grips on the side are pure plastic. It’s like some one put electronics and RGB lighting in a snap on model of a naga. The one positive thing from this is the weight... at 85 grams it’s the only thing that’s comfortable to move around.
2,Great mouse but lately if i try to flick to a target fast the mouse just loses connection or the DPI jumps to about 2000 for no reason. Have checked the cable and tried multiple ports all with the same issue.
1,Over the past decade I have used several Razer products and they all have one thing in common they all break. This mouse literally didn't even last a week. The mouse buttons don't function properly anymore and you know what? I'm not surprised. Don't buy Razer they spend more money on the crappy pamphlets telling you how great their products are than the actual product. "We were the first to offer a mouse worthy of being called a gaming mouse that provided gamers with the precision and accuracy we require." What a joke. Save your money.
1,I've been using this mouse as my main for two years now. And the 1st and 2nd buttons are starting to go. Its difficult to drag and drop files to aim in fps games. I've had to re route to aim function to the 4th or 5th button. This mouse and razer's crummy software has turned me off of them for good
2,Coming from console this nose helped me alot to transfer over to pc but after a year and half I went through 3 if then because of the double click the switchable buttons on the side are awesome but the double click is making me look for another mouse.
1,2.4 ghz setting constantly lags. Not worth the purchase.
1,I've purchased two of this model and couldn't get 6 months of use out of either. First one I had ended up with a double click in the left clicker and with this current one I have either the 12 button side quits working or the left clicker quits.I will never buy another Razer product due to the expensive price and cheap manufacturing.
1,The mouse wheel is loose and shaky with so much play both back-and-forth and side-to-side its a veritable mini-game just to use it.  I can't use this thing.
1,Great mouse until it started doing the misclick- double click. Cannot drag and drop or highlight multiple items because holding down the right click malfunctions.I bought the mouse in September 2019 it is now march 2020. So I only got 6 months of use... and I paid $75 for only 6 months of play.  Can I get my money back or a new mouse?I do not recommend this mouse.  Find a cheaper MMO mouse and get the same or better quality. I am very disappointed in Razer... I am no longer their fan.
5,Mouse pad  is rough on hands and scrapped mine a bit. Good otherwise.
1,Bough the mouse in June of 2019 worked fine for four months and started failing the right and left click mouse buttons click just fine they don't do anything fairly frequently.  Is frustrating will be cruising my toon along and contact will break with no change in pressure this is a problem in the midst of a tough battle total momentary loss o f control.  No reply from the manufacturer other than the statement which  in the automated response which indicated a response within 24 hours and didn't happen.  Just ordered a new mouse NOT a Razer.
1,Found out AFTER purchasing that you must download their software and create an account in order to use the mouse as advertised. Nowhere on the retail box does it say or suggest that. I find that despicable and will not use or recommend this company to anyone I know.On top of that their software is 300+mb in size. It's absolutely absurd that anyone would think it takes that much space to store configurations for a mouse.
5,The versatility of this mouse is awesome and I actually have two of them now on my computers.
5,My husband adores this mouse. It's comfortable and works very well
5,Exactly what I wanted.
5,No problems with it yet and I've used it every day
5,Works great. Constantly changing sides for different games.
1,no compren este producto a los menos de 6 meses empiezan a fallar teclas del mouse y no tiene garantia
5,The interchangeable plates are very useful and overall the product is very functional.
5,Works great for gaming. With multiple attachments
1,This mouse stopped working after 4 weeks. 7 days passed the return date of course.
5,Love it.
2,Use this for playing Wow the left and right buttons 4 months later just don't respond. Not sure why on investigation it seems to be a known problem with these. Other than that it is great but I'll probably be going back to a different brand.
5,I really love this mouse so far i highly recommend!
5,Best mouse I have ever used! Easy to configure.
1,My keyboard mice and head phone purchaces used to be mostly Razer but it seems the quality of their products have gone down over the years. Had one of their 200 headsets snap where the cup rotates after a year and a half of use and now this. The left and sometimes the right double clicks not really pleasant when it can cause frustrating mistakes over and over again. Definitely going to be thinking twice about Razer products if I even think about buying any more.
5,Good mouse
5,5 stars
5,Great product
1,Ive gone through 4 of these in 3 months. Never again Razer. All were defective— double clicking. Mouse clicker working as if It were being held down. Couldnt play shooters. I used my old Razer mouse for like 2 years (the one without the three switcheroo sides) but they screwed up production with this one and sold it anyway. Been using Razer for 10 years but I’ll be using logitech or corsair now.
5,Perfect
1,It's been about a year now and I'm getting double clicking or having to press really hard on my right mouse button for it to work.According the Razer website I'm suppose to have warranty for two years. I bought it in July of 2019 and went I went to RMA it said out of warranty. Considering how many are having issues with the switches I'd avoid this mouse all together.
2,Most inconsistent mouse I have ever used random double clicks can't hold in a click and drag the mouse without it messing up. Worthless
2,Buttons on the side are too sensitive mouse feels kind of short too and doesn't sit right in the palm of the hand. I recently bought this to replace my old Razer Naga and now I kind of want something else because its just not as good.
2,Missing and wrong clicks and Double clicking after only 3 months ... I hope if I can get refund for my money... thanks
2,For a few months the mouse worked great but I ran into a problem with this naga that has been a problem with every razer mouse I have ever purchased. After a few months of use it now double clicks randomly when left clicking. This seems to be an ongoing issue with the naga mouse.
1,Great mouse but you'd think after years of people reporting this issue they'd fix the clickers. Failed after about 4 months of moderate use. Not a power gamer so this is really unacceptable. You can submit RMA but who has the time to jump through endless RMA hoops for a $90 mouse. Buyer beware.
5,I love Razer accessories never had problem with them personally
1,After about 6 months of use I noticed the mouse would double click from time to time on its own. After 9 months it does that and right click fails intermittently. Almost 12 months in and I had to replace it. This mouse it terrible. For the cash it was a total waste. Wont buy another Razer mouse until they get back to making quality devices.
5,Excelente mouse!! Recomendado totalmente con amazon
1,Razor is a ripoff Within a year my mouse gave up the ghost to the dreadded misclicking issue.A 100$ mouse shouldn't have these kinds of issues your paying for a brand/ symbol or sticker not quality.I suggest staying away from Razor I won't be buying any more products from Razor.
1,I love Razer products but those mouse will kill my mental health. I bought a new one because left button stopped working after some issues. Guess what issues are back with the new one! Click works but dragging anything (i.e maintaining click down while moving the mouse) works 30% of the time it's a nightmare. I was not expecting the same issue to happen twice that fast for a mouse this expensive ! I'll just stop buying razer products i guess.
5,Great buy
5,King of MMO gaming mice.
1,The left mouse button sometimes cuts out when you click and hold.  This causes problems when trying to drag the cursor.  Things you CANNOT do with this mouse are:1) Move a window.2) Pan the camera around in a game.3) Highlight text.If you enjoy doing any of these things look elsewhere.  The price you're paying is for the cool lights not a functional gaming mouse.Don't be like me do an internet search prior to buying.  Razer has issues with it's left and right mouse buttons going out.ARG!
5,It’s what I needed in a mouse
5,It is awesome
5,Great mouse for MMO's. No complaints
5,:)
1,This mouse has a wheel that sticks badly and the side buttons function erratically at best. It was used for gaming for less than 2 weeks when the problems began.  Amazon connected me to to Razer after being unable to return the item  due to missing the return window. They had me jump through hoops and then promised a follow up email with troubleshooting tips instead of a replacement.  They were provided with phone and email and verified it but the email was never received. I am  disappointed in both companies.
1,see other reviews for double click issue this is wide spread on this model mouse. ive owned 3 nagas and this one is complete trash. after 3 months of ownership double clicking started to occur got an RMA through razer to replace the mouse after jumping through the hoops they require before authorizing the return (even though this is an obvious known issue). after 2 months with the replacement mouse double clicking was BACK and even worse than before. i will never purchase another razer product because of this garbage HELLO LOGITECH G600.
5,The change is quick the keys work great and it is reliable.
5,Works
2,Left and right click buttons started double clicking or not registering click and drag less than 3 months after buying it. Good movement tracking switchable side panels are ok really only used the 12 button.
1,This product is not nearly as all-encompassing as Razer says it is. I try to use the programmable side buttons with a run-of-the-mill program like VLC Media Player and then my scroll wheel won't work in Chrome. Razer replaced my product and I still have the same issue. Now they want me to do some 20-step process where I uninstall and reinstall software while also messing with my OS. Save your money and buy a cheaper product that might actually work.
1,The design and function are great. This is the 3rd Razer Naga I've purchased. It is great for gaming until you play a game that requires clicking fast. All three that I own the left clicker malfunctions. It will double click not click or stick. This has been an on going problem with these mice. They've known of it for many years and continue to produce them. They charge a premium price for a product that breaks within 2 months of use. If you want to throw your money away buy this.
2,The side buttons broke after two months. Highly disappointed because it's expensive and I had bought one previously that lasted years
1,Despite all the negative reviews I purchased this and regretted it. The battery life is absolutely horrible and the mouse has constant lag issues. Returned immediately.
2,I liked the mouse until it stopped working properlymy left mouse click went out about 3 months after buying this mouseregisters double clicks or no clicks at allthe rest of the mouse is nice but i cannot use it since the left click won't work right
5,Great product at a good price. Good quality!
1,This mouse is NOT programmable if you do not have an internet connection. You must create a RAZER account and sign-in in order to program the buttons. I work in a secure facility that prohibits internet connectivity. I have no idea why RAZER does not allow you to program the buttons offline. Why eliminate an entire segment of your customer base? It is being returned and I am going in search of a programmable mouse that does allow offline programming - just like it has been for many years prior. Hope not every vendor has adopted this cloud-only approach.
1,had an old Naga that lasted for years.  Bought this one and had a bad feeling about it right out of the box.  It looks and feels cheap compared to the old one.Dead in less than 3 months.Listen to the reviews and avoid.
1,I had to disable like 5 things from being able to wake up the computer due to this mouse immediately waking up the computer after I put it to sleep. Now that I fixed that problem the computer refuses to go to sleep on it's own after 15 minutes like it's set for which I'm also going to blame on this mouse. Very annoying!
1,Button stop working in less this six months only played wow with it
2,For whatever reason this mouse seems to be incompatible with my laptop.  I thought it was initially a defective mouse but I'm having the same issues with the replacement.  It will randomly register shift and/or control with no buttons being pressed and sometimes freaks out and spams ddedddeddded infinitely until being unplugged.
1,i realize everybody's hands are different but this mouse felt horrid under mine.  it's just too chunky...  which is almost a minor issue compared to the software needed to customize it.synapse is nothing short of cancer for computers and why the hell anyone should need to make an online account to use a mouse is beyond me.  i damn near packaged it back up when it got to the "create a login" screen.of all the things that should be connected to the "cloud" an input device should NOT be one.  give me a break.
5,c:
5,my son is a gamer and love it
1,This is my second razer mouse purchase.  My first was replaced due to double-clicking.  My second Razer mouse failed after 3 months of regular use.  I have done enough research now to know Razer will not be a 3rd purchase for me.
1,Honestly this is like the 4th time iv purchased this mouse and iv never had one last more than six months it’s ridiculous that they build these things to break down please save yourself money and buy any other mouse out there it’s not worth it with how short of a lifespan these mice have it’s ridiculous Naha razor needs to bring back the naga mouse because I loved that mouse!
1,Bought this for my husband but less than a month later he has on multiple occasions experienced the number pad not registering clicks or the wheel getting stuck. Before this he used the Razer MMO mouse (old version of this one no interchangeable plate just number pad) for over 7 years with no issue. Will be returning this mouse.
1,What else can I say. I bought it in January. First razer product ever. I wanted to use it for shortcuts while coding at work but the side keys don’t work half the time. Also in rare occasions the left click doesn’t register. Which kinda sucks at this price.I really wanted to believe in Razer. Let’s see how their customer support is. This can’t be my fault so I hope the warranty will cover it :)
1,Bought mine in June 2020 and have been fighting the left double click issue for a couple of months now. Thought it was me or my Mac at first but its not. Looking for another mouse now. Won't be a Razer product though. I have always had good luck with Razer products but this thing is crap.
1,As others have already stated immediately out of removing my mouse from the packaging it felt great. A good weight very durable feeling all around. I game a lot (MMOs) so I use the 12 numeric pad for this mouse. Immediately something felt off with the number 2 as if it wasn't being pressed sometimes. You have to put a lot more force into pressing the 2 key on the mouse. Then about a week later the lights shut off and the numeric pad won't work at all. Overall very dissatisfied with this product and immediately refunded it to get a new mouse.
5,Ok
1,I had purchased this mouse because I had read that it was fantastic for MMO's.  I was loving this mouse until it just completely stopped working after a month. The side panel constantly loses connection and the buttons are pretty much useless.  I am extremely disappointed with the quality of this mouse. I use to love razor products but I am most likely going to purchase another mouse elsewhere.  Hopefully the next mouse I buy lasts longer than a month especially with the 70 dollar price tag.
5,So far it’s worked perfectly. No complaints.
1,I've had this mouse for a very long time and I have constantly had to deal with it double clicking. Fortunately warranty covers this and I was able to get a new mouse. Unfortunately 2 weeks since getting the new mouse the same issue keeps happening. The issue happens on multiple computers and I have tried many fixes but nothing works. The literal design of the mouse is just its own set of problems.
1,Double clicking after couple  months. Razer quality control has went down big time. First one I ever bought lasted me years and only replaced after I wore the buttons out after all that wear and tear of playing mmos.  Bought this to replace another model that was double clicking after about a year and this one started after a few weeks.
1,Double clicking when you single click lets go of click during drag. All sorts of issues with the left mouse button. Prior to these issues was a good mouse - but I've had it for only 6 months. Terrible QC especially as this issue can be documented going back 3 years. Wish I had known when I purchased it. Going in the junk box.
2,The mouse stopped being recognized after 4 months of use. I tried plugging it into a desktop and two different laptops and it would not be recognized. It's a shame that Razer products are so hit and miss.
5,Amazing
1,Loved the mouse but dislike the company (Razer) that abandoned Mac users and stopped updating its absolutely necessary software so that by Big Sur OS the devices are not seen by a Mac and are now expensive paper weights. If you have a Mac don't buy it. Really sad about this as the mouse was great for gaming.
2,Most issues are related to driver software.  Unlike previous versions of the mouse the side buttons aren’t sensitive to length of press so game functions that rely on hold time to control power don’t work fully. See Shout in Skyrim. Assigning keys and saving macro sets is NOT intuitive.
1,The one I tried at Best Buy worked great. I purchased this on Amazon and the right click was jacked up. I returned it for another one on Amazon and the right click was even worse than the last one. Terrible.
5,Just get it. Wont be disappointed.
1,As other reviews have posted this mouse starts to double click. I had it for a few months before this started to happen. Customer service was a nightmare as far as replacing the mouse to the point I won't buy another naga.
1,You read all the reviews online about how bad the quality of Razer products are and you think "oh those problems wont happen to me" then 4 months down the road the buttons on your $90 mouse stop working and Amazon wont refund and Razer wont fo anything for you until you take them to small claims court.TLDR: Razer products are a giant pile of trash.. do not buy
1,I used to completely support Razer mice. My first Razer Naga (molten core edition) lasted me the better part of a decade. However these new mice won't even last you 6 months. I bought mine June 2019 and now January 2020 I have to find another replacement. The Right-Click doesn't work anymore which is important in almost every videogame I can think of. Definitely not spending more money on any Razer products. Next mouse is going to be Logitech G600 for less than half the price of this garbage.
5,Good
2,Great Mouse horrible software sold mine on E-bay.Using a corsair scimitar never had a problem with the mouse or the software.
5,Great mouse.  Love all the options.
5,Perfect for gaming
5,excellent mmo/moba mouse would recommend.
1,It's 2020 these things should work out of the box. After multiple software downloads and restarts the app is not recognize the ability to setup macros for the mouse. Tried using razer's virtual chat which is a joke and the support website is slow. Will not recommend. For a point and click mouse the mouse feels good but don't expect any extra features to work out of the box. Website is atrocious for support.
2,About one week ago started getting phantom clicks making the mouse unreliable for pretty much anything.  Gave it a 2 as it was a good mouse up until that point but quality is everything at the high end - and this failed to have it.
5,Amazing mouse best one I’ve ever owned
1,I'll start off with the positives. The mouse feels great in my hand and it isn't overly large like the G600 but is bigger than the 2012 Razer Naga. Side buttons are clicky.However straight out of the box I had problems with the optical sensor.As an MMO mouse it's quite noticeable when you're playing and moving your camera around. The mouse would jump randomly causing me to look off into directions unknown. I've only owned it for a few hours now but am already going to return it.
1,A few weeks after I purchased this mouse the buttons on the side panel stopped working and would only work 1/4 clicks. The following week the left click on the mouse began to lose functionality. I replaced the mouse through amazon and thought that it may have just been a defective model. Now that another few weeks have passed the same issues happened with the side panels. Avoid this product and if you cannot then get the warranty because the shabby construction will need it.
5,Good quality and comfortable
5,Works great! Would buy again if it ever broke.
5,Awesome mouse
1,So i am writing this i've had to RMA my last razer trinity because it was having similar issues with just the right click randomly double clicking and releasing. It took almost a month to get razer to let me RMA it even tho it was under warranty. Now almost 6 months to the day my new replacement mouse right click and left click are double clicking randomly. I'm done with razer after this support seems to be going down hill along with quality control.
1,I've tried this mouse on three different computers and had the same result on each one. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground when it comes to mouse sensitivity. You can either move the cursor at a snail's pace or at light speed. I never had this issue with my old Nagas. Maybe I got a bad one. I forgot to return it so it has been in my closet for about 6 months and seeing it last night reminded me to leave a review.
1,This is my third razer naga mouse and all have died within the year. I am not gaming 24/7 on them nor am I rough on it. One died within 3 months and the other 2 have lasted 7-8 months before it stops left clicking. I love the company but this is the last straw. I am going to go bankrupt just trying to afford these things since I am too busy to RMA them. Will not buy again
1,I treated this mouse like GOLD before I got jumpy scroll wheel which got aggravating FAST. Razer support was barely any help either and with it breaking right after the return date passed it was just a useless piece of plastic.
1,A few months after buying this mouse I started having problems with the click and hold releasing randomly. This is particularly frustrating for dragging files around or pretty much any sort of gaming. After looking into the issue it seems to be rather common with people recommending you take the mouse apart to fix it.
1,The mouse click skipping that prevent the player from turning the camera in games like WoW and if you try and shot in FPS it will shot once and stop while you are still holding the left button is a huge deal-breaker that made me hate games but it goes beyond that as I can't highlight anything on the screen or drag and drop stuff because it will stop like I left my finger off while I didn't...
1,Barely over a year old and this mouse is already having issues.  Ive tried contacting Razor support and get slapped with a response that my device is no longer covered under support.  I will never buy another Razor product again how does an 70$ mouse have issues after a year?  Save your money and look else where.
1,Please do not buy these mice. This is my 3rd one with the same problem. The left and right mouser buttons go out after some use. I have 2 friends who have bought this same mouse with the same problems. I'm normally not one to look a negative reviews but this is to widespread problem in the product to ignore
5,Excellent mause versatile good sensor PMW 3369
1,Bought this item on Aug 30 2019 as a replacement for another Razer mouse that was giving me problems. Now this mouse is giving me the same problems as the other one so probably I didn't have to buy another mouse. The problem is when I left click the mouse buttons once the mouse acts like I did a double-click which is really annoying when playing games where you need to click once and be one click only. I will never buy another mouse from Razer.
1,i do not recommend buying mouse hardware from razor you will most likely get a usable product but there should be no risk involved with something at this price point.
5,Good overall and good feel
3,It is is an okay mouse.
5,Works great
2,Works well but click problems suck
5,Great for indecisive people who just couldn't pick a model.
5,Best mouse I’ve ever used
5,Love the quick change on this mouse.
1,Built to fail after a few months. I don't know why I keep going back to razer maybe I believe they'll change and make quality products. I might just be a fool. If you want something that lasts do not buy.
1,I do alot of heavy gaming that i use the mouse buttons ALOT. So I had no problem replacing the mouse every 2 years or so but now I ordered this one and the 1 button does not work unless you click it just right and other buttons seem the misclicks randomly. I'm not sure what im going to be switching too but after 80$ on this and its not going to even work out the box idk it's a sad day for me right now.
5,Best mouse I’ve ever used
1,In FFXIV you hold the left and right mouse buttons down to run. If I just sit there and hold them down sometimes she won't move sometimes she will. I checked the mouse is clean. I used a can of air just in case there was some dust nothing.It intermittently works.I liked this mouse but seems like I got the one bad one in the bunch. Since I can't return/exchange this I'm going to just buy a different brand.
5,The 12 side buttons are amazing.
1,Bought this for my sim for his birthday on June 20th. Today he tells me that the left click button is messing up and stops working. For a $75 mouse it shouldn’t stop working after 3 months! I might have gotten a faulty one but I don’t think I would buy this mouse again if it’s only going to last 3 months and that’s it! Disappointed
1,Felt great liked the multiple side panels but cheap internals. one plus is its hard to destroy i would not recommend
1,This currently is my seventh Naga. I had purchased from best buy and Had to use my warranty multiple times do to the Left click double clicking in a matter of months. Tried one on amazon hoping for any luck but in a matter of a Month its double clicking badly again. I wish Razer will use Omron Switches instead of these Chinese ones till then Im going to just purchase a G600 And I advise staying away from this mouse
1,It double clicks like mad. It will eventually start double clicking on the both the right and left clickers.It has messed me up countless times in games like world of warcraft and has either gotten me to pick the wrong peice of gear from a quest to repeatedly dying non stop because of misclicks due to the double click malfunction on the mouse.This is no gaming mouse if it lowers your performance in game. Trashy mouse.
1,Actually died mid game. PC won’t identify the mouse. Tried reinstalling synapse restarting using different USB ports. Nothing. PC will id for a couple seconds then just quits and mouse won’t work.
5,My Razer Trinity lasted me 6 years before double click started and that lasted me through a move and multiple trips to college and back while playing esports for games like CSGO R6S and Fortnite not sure what most people are talking about when they say it lasts only a few months or a year or two because despite all the conditions this mouse lasted me for a very very long time!
3,Very much okaish
5,Nice for gaming
5,Built well and feels durable
1,I probably got 2 reburbished mouses but that is the gamble you take with Amazon. Had to return 2 of these because the scroll went out on the first one and the right click became faulty on the replacement mouse. Great mouse but don't buy it from Amazon.
1,I have been through two of these now in 7 months. Both times the left click eventually stops functioning properly and won't hold the button down. So while dragging a window it lets go selecting a line of text and having it just stop selecting in the middle because it acts as if you let go. Extremely frustrating. My old naga has lasted years so something changed. Not RMAing a second time will go with a different brand at this point.
1,Within a week of owning the mouse my #5 key on the 12 button attachment of the mouse stopped working.  I had the product replaced.  two months after having the replaced product my #7 and 3 key stopped working on the 12 button attachment.  Until confirmation that this reoccurring issue has been fixed i can't recommend the mouse.  and its a shame because the utility of it is amazing and it feels great in your hands.
5,great for gaming
1,I ordered this mouse on July 9th of 2020. As of today December 1st 2020 the right mouse button does not “hold”. Playing wow I use the right mouse button to hold and rotate my camera. It now releases early. Every Naga I’ve had does this same thing after about 6 months.Will not be purchasing another.
1,99% of the time the wrong panel is recognized and none of the buttons register.
1,Razer has NEVER been able to STOP this issue with their mice. The left mouse button will double click nonstop unless you blow hot air into it - slowly. LOL!This company has knowingly produced a piece of hardware for years with the same 2 problems:  Left click mouse does a double click or the scroll wheel stutters and fails.Razer is no longer a quality company. Keyboards are *ok'ish" but their mouse are 100% trash now.
5,Works good for gaming.
5,Great product
1,You'll see the entire first page of google as "mouse 1 double clicks or doesnt click at all" if you google "razer naga issue".It's SUPER COMMON that this mouse will suddenly stop working and cause you to double click or skip clicks altogether. I've lost HUNDREDS of death situations directly due to this mouse.
1,Poorly designed. The 12 button side panel is frustrating to use because picking up the mouse to adjust position inevitably clicks buttons. The worst part is the software to customize buttons and rgb. It is unbeleivebly over complicated and not user friendly plus it needs to run in the background to switch between profiles which I could never get to work properly anyway.
1,Awful quality control. I've tried two of these and both have very loose left and right click buttons. I mean LOOSE to the point that the buttons give double feedback once when the loose plastic hits the switch and then the actual switch. For a $150 mouse you would think they would at least pretend that they care.
5,Everything I didn't know I was looking for...
1,I’ve had this mouse for several months now despite only being 1 foot away from the tower this mouse constantly drops its connection and lags until the connection reestablishes again. It’s very frustrating.
5,I love the extra buttons on the side.
5,Excellent items
1,After 3 months I started getting the double clicking problem after 5 months it’s completely unusable in games because of how frequent the double clicking happens. Tried getting razer support and they made the entire process as painful as possible as expected. Just bought a Logitech and not looking back.
1,Mouse constantly disconnects when using 2.4ghz connection and I am getting the double click issue after only a few months. What a piece of garbage for such an expensive mouse.
1,I've bought so many razer naga mouses.  Everytime one fails i just buy another because I love the mouse and it's perfect for me.  This will be my last.  I purchased it 25 days ago and haven't even been doing much gaming with it lately and it already double clicking everything.  I'm disappointed because i bought this one to replace my old naga that had one of the side buttons failing.  I'm going to go with a different mouse this time.
1,I've bought so many of their mouses and the Naga was a great mouse the latest model was great too until it starts accumulating static and then the unintended double clicking happens. Don't buy this mouse you'll end up blowing your breath into the mouse 1 button like an idiot every 5 minutes to disperse the static and stop the unintended double clicking. I own 2 of these mice and both have the same problem.
1,Brand new outta the box. It lights up but does not function. I tried to do a clean install of their software and still nothing. Customer service Chat box advised to restart my computer and still nothing. I spent over an hour trying to get this working so I will just return.
1,The Amazon envelope this arrived in looked pristine which causes me to believe it was in this condition before it was packaged and shipped. I'm sure it's a great product but it's very disappointing that this is the condition it arrived in especially considering it is a Christmas gift.
1,This junk just randomly started double clicking or letting go of a held down left click and clicking again. Makes pretty much any form of gaming or even just any kind of day to day click and drag function unable to use. Of course I tossed out the box so there goes the refund. Complete waste of money. Not to forget still have to use that blasted Razer garbage Synapse
1,Got the double clicking issue after 15 months. Razer quality has gone completely down the drain and their support doesn't care anymore. Taking my money and going elsewhere.
1,What can I say.  This is the 3rd Naga I've owned and all three failed with the same issue.  The buttons would click multiple times.  This one failed after about 3 day.  Do yourself a favor and never buy a Razer mouse.  I've owned 6 in the last 10 years that are all dead but the Logitech G400 and G502 that I bought at various times to replace them STILL WORK FLAWLESSLY.
1,Not good. It stopped left clicking.  The left click hold and drag just stopped working.  Razer knows. At this point its buy at own risk. Sometimes they are bulletproof for years. Then the click buttons go
1,Don’t. Just don’t. The double click and mis-click issue needs to be addressed. I’m not alone on this either. 9 months is all it lasted. Infuriating. Razer won’t do anything about it either. I have returned all my razer products due to this. Go with Logitech or Corsair.
1,after just over a year 3 out of the 3 razer mice i have purchased have gotten the mis/ double click issue that makes them unusable. Its a shame as they look very nice but clearly there is a problem with quality. Definitely will not be buying mice from razer again as i have had this problem a few years back and had hoped something had changed but clearly not.
5,Great for PC gaming.
5,Good Gaming Mouse
2,Had for about a year thumb buttons no longer work on 2 out of 3 side plates.
5,It has a smooth movement and nice grip.
1,Left clicking and dragging issues started a year after I bought this mouse.  Went through 2 different razer mouse within 3 years with the same issue.  I just hope razer reaches out to their customers and take responsibility for their products and honor their warranty.  This unacceptable!
1,This mouse was great... while it worked. The left click on the mouse started double clicking dropping windows while moving them etc only a year after I bought it with moderate gaming use. For $70+ this is an awful mouse. If you're spending that much on a mouse it should last 3-5 years or more. The mouse is practically unusable at this point and DIY fixes for the issue are extremely complicated. Shop somewhere else.
2,Worked great for about a month. Just like the other naga mice from the past the left and right click buttons became inaccurate and unusable. You would think this issue would have been resolved years ago.....
5,Fun it's great for MMO's and Fortnite.
1,This is the second one of these I've owned and both have had the same issue of double clicking or being unable to even hold a click. Can't even properly play most of my games anymore. The original Naga was way better than this piece of hot garbage
1,This mouse has many things to like about it but has one single flaw that makes it unusable for me: The left click button is horrible. While the much superior 2014 naga had a smooth slope this one has an "ergonomic" sort of contour that makes zero sense making it incredibly uncomfortable to use. Instant return and now I have to look for a new 12 button mouse because they don't make their much better 2014 models anymore.
5,Beautiful and accurate
5,Well brother loved his xmas gift!
1,Got this back in July and just had to order a new mouse (NOT Razer) because of the weird double-click or no-click thing. Until it effed up it was pretty good. I think Ill be shifting away from Razer from now on - big waste.
2,Great mouse until the double clicking starts. For some games it's not an issue but it gets annoying after a while. Apparently it's an issue with this model. Can't really recommend it for the price.
2,My small hands feel very uncomfortable with this mouse
5,For all users
1,Same old story.. Just much quicker to the inevitable double click. Double clicking after about 3 days of use. I love everything about the Naga wish they'd get it together these products are too expensive to fail so quickly. At least this one quit while I can still get a refund. Razer we want to use your mouse fix it! In my opinion everything else about this mouse is top notch.. if only it worked.
1,Bought the Mouse in August it is now October and the double click issue is my biggest geipe with the mouse. Worked fine the first months I had it but now when I try to ADS in games it will take me out of ADS even though im still holding the right mouse button.
1,Like many other people my Trinity started having major clicking issues after about 3 months.  Sometimes it double clicks sometimes it stops registering that I'm holding down a button sometimes it doesn't register a click at all.Do not buy this mouse unless you're okay with replacing it 4 times a year.
5,Great!!!!
1,This has happened with 2 mice for me. The first mouse had the issue about 6 months in and RMA'd it with Razer. That process took way longer than it should because Razer left me hanging for weeks. After I got the new one things were fine for another 6 months and then it started to happen again. Will not be buying another Razer mouse again.
1,These things die so fast. They are garbage. I've had my current (2nd or 3rd can't remember) for 18 months and the left click already is busted again. I'm not a mouse clicking psychopath. I don't slam or abuse my equipment. This is just overpriced garbage.
5,Love it !
1,don't spend money on this garbage.
1,Do not buy this product. Mine crapped out less than 2 months in and they fought me on replacing it. Worst experience I've ever had with Razer or Amazon. Turned me off from them totally.
1,This could be my favorite mouse the switch has gone bad now within a year. I play so many different games I love being able to switch the side panels but I get the double click bug twice now with two mouses.
1,As many reviews have already mentioned after a few short months of use the left click stopped working. It will randomly double click. If you click and hold it will stop holding on its own. This makes this gaming mouse pretty much unusable for gaming.
1,ANother razer mouse very expensive. Three months later left button double clicking.... This isn't my first time either. After having a death adder for a year it started double clicking. Then I bought another deathadder it was double clicking out the box. Now this mouse 3 months later left click double clicks constantly. I can't take it no more. Probably my last razer mouse... I may buy another deathadder just because it is so cheap but this is ridiculous.
1,Bought this back in 2018 actually RMA'd it under a warranty once its been about a year and i'm having the same issue again. The left mouse button will random stop working or wont click this obviously causes issues in FPS/shooter games when you're trying to shoot and the lmb stops working.
5,None
1,Button on the side sometimes won’t work. Randomly my $9 mouse works better. Wanted to try this. It’s just fancy junk just like your Probubly  curious about as your checking this product out right now.
5,Ease of use
1,died after 2 weeks while it did work would always lag when under 40% battery
1,I've been using Razor Nage for about 8 years now The original Naga back in 2009 was amazing every mouse after that got worse and worse. The Razor Naga Epic wasn't that bad but this one is very very bad. The side buttons never all work at the same time because the magnet never connects just right. You need to remove the side panel multiple times in order to get it working. I'll be getting a refund asap.
1,Terrible. Feels cheaply built button presses feel weak feels like it could break any second. It will be returned.
1,So... it's just started in the last week. If you click/hold an item or try to highlight text it will unclick then reclick like it forgets you're holding down the button then all of a sudden realizes you're still holding it. Sad. My Razer Naga Molten Edition was amazing. Now just garbage. 1 year 2 mos after I bought it. For $74 it should last more than a year...
5,Amazing mouse for all gamers.
1,Overall this mouse was great till the double click issue.  I had problems within 4 months.  Basically single click turns into double and no real way to fix without taking the sensor apart.  There are plenty of posts on the internet that  confirms the double click issue and some how to fix it through taking sensor apart.  But honestly save yourself the issues and look elsewhere.
1,Poorly manufactured piece of overpriced crap.  I will never buy another razor product.  Scroll wheel and middle mouse button malfunction.  Overall the worst gaming mouse I have ever owned
1,This isn't the Razer of the past anymore people!!!! I've gotten 2 i repeat 2 of these mice each time I've gotten the left click bug for each one only after a few months of use. absolutely unacceptable considering the price of this product and the razer guarantee. i'm never buying from them again and i encourage you all not to as well as there are many more companies than there were when we started gaming
1,Had this bad boy for 3 months enjoyed every day of it.One day it started having a click and hold issue I just thought it was the game and moved on but it started doing it more and more often. Talked to some friends that had this mouse and it seems to be a frequent issue.
1,I have had NOTHING but issues out of this mouse because the Scroll Wheel binds up and then just randomly frees itself with no explanation.Wouldn't recommend this to anyone even if it were the last mouse on earth.
1,Was quite surprised when the product started double clicking so soon after purchase that I thought it might have been some type of software bug. After exhausted all other possibilities I have narrowed it down to the mouse itself and was surprised to find many others experiencing the same problem with this model. This will probably be the last razer product I will buy they just seem to burn out quicker and quicker.
1,This mouse gets very light use moderate gaming mostly just to get me to a YouTube Playlist. But the left key on this mouse will NOT stop ghost clicking. Even touching the left mouse button causes it to click around 5 times. I've tried cleaning it re-installing my software and even thought it might have been my computer.For the price I'm very disappointed. I'd return it if I could.
5,Keyboard on side operates smooth
1,Been using it for 7 months. right and left click are now failing I cant click and hold anything so it is just became useless at this point.
1,This mouse is great... Until it breaks in less than a year. I would not recommend it unless you want to buy a new mouse every year.
1,It's a comfortable mouse that works fantastically for about 2 weeks out of the box.  Beyond that it's overpriced trash and a $10 mouse from Walmart will perform infinitely better.  I've gotten the left/right click stopping working on 3 separate mice that I've had razer replace and it's a shame because my old Naga lasted me 3 years before the wireless stopped working and another year using it wired only.
1,only had mine for about a month before i started having issues with the right click releasing while i was still holding it down. makes trying to control you char in games like WoW super annoying and almost unplayable.
1,Purchases on July 1st. Mouse is now randomly making extra clicks with increasing frequency—completely unusable. The damage this thing could do if I weren’t unplugging it while working from home...I’m reading that this is a pretty common problem. I’ll be writing Razer for a refund or replacement.
5,great little mouse
1,No software support for Mac OS
1,Right from the start the buttons on the side of the mouse 1-12 would not work correctly. For about 5 minutes they would work and all of a sudden it would take 4 clicks on one button for it to work. I have tried updating drivers and installing Razer Synapse 3 and it is still not working correctly. Razer used to be an amazing brand but their quality has gone down.
5,The price was good.
1,Just another unreliable Razer product.  Got this to replace my 6 month old razer naga chroma who’s center mouse key randomly stoped working.  Got this one and plugged it in and the lights would flicker every time I tried to hit a button and nothing else would happen.  Can’t even get this one to work for one day let alone the 6 month my other razer mouse worked.  Save your money don’t buy this product.
1,The left click on this mouse breaks after a year. I've come to discover that this is a well known issue with Razer mice according to other owners. Holding the left-click down does not work and Razer support does not help. I will not buy a Razer mouse again.
1,Used for months caused fingers to feel numb from applying force with my thumb on so many buttons. This isn’t natural or good for your hand.
1,Don't convince yourself that you might be lucky and get a mouse that doesn't get the double click issue. EVERY replacement I got had a loose left/right mouse button all which double click half the time you use it. Such a shame this is one of the few mice on the market that have a 12 button design. Razer never again.
1,Absolutely horrid durability. first Mouse began double clicking after 8 months. I really liked the side button options and i figured it must just be a deffective unit so I bought a second one. ghis one begam double clicking after only 4 months. I got a replacement via warranty. The replacement lasted 6 months. Razer you made a crappy product.
1,not even a month in and the Right Click is loose and doesn't click at times.My friend had the same issue with his Naga. It seems Razer has gone down in quality i got my naga with the tartarus v2 and that as well was defective with some keys staying active even though I wasn't pressing anything. I'm done with this brand.
2,Contacts on the right mouse button have been going out on me within 6 months of use. Double/Triple clicking on a single click failing to continue to register a sustained press and other problems.
1,Paid for what was sold as brand new I received used product. Pictures above are where it has gunk on it where it was used before being repackaged and sent out claiming to be new.
5,Great product
5,Great mouse. Had no problems so far.
5,I love this mouse!! It is great!!
1,Mouse didn't work from the moment I plugged it in. It kept pushing a key (the letter K) repeatedly and nothing I did would fix the problem.
1,I liked naga products before and thought I’d try one again. The buttons on the side are way to close and my hand kept pushing them when I did not want to. The software was the number one thing that made me dislike this product. It’s laggy as all get out and hard to use. I think it’s becuase it’s linked to there live server and that was an issue. Wouldn’t buy it again.
5,Good product.
1,Got the Double Miss-Clicking issue on left click after two months of use. So broken actuator by design. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE WITH A MOUSE THIS EXPENSIVE?
1,Left click started double clicking within a month. I have to breathe with hot breath into the gap under the left click to get it to stop. This solution works for about 20 minutes at a time.
1,I have been using Razer products for years. I have also spent over 20 hours with customer service and more than that tweaking there crap software. For years I have had to find work arounds to get things working. They have sent me lines of code scripts to use. A customer shouldn't have to do that. They make the worst software I am done. Never again will I buy Razer junk. You have been warned.
5,Me encanto el servicio
5,Perfect gamers gift
5,Great product!!!
2,Same as what most other reviews have said the left click failure. Razer's going to RMA the mouse so hopefully I get a decent replacement.
1,Bought in December 2019 and its now end of May 2020 the mouse has already crapped out double clicks constantly. If you are looking at this thinking it wont happen to you stop it buy something else. Logitech makes better quality products that tend to last quite a bit of time unlike Razer the last few years.
2,Good Mouse but bad software adjusts itself and then does not allow you to change back which makes for bad gameplay would not buy a razer product again sticking with logitech
1,This mouse worked well for about a week. Then hell broke loose... The mouse would double click constantly for no reason which as a gamer causes me to die often. Don't get this mouse if you play any games that are mouse reliant because it will fail you right out of the box.
1,Mouse is double clicking the right click. Tried to go through razer support but my product is no longer under warranty apparently. I only bought it 4 months ago. Avoid this mouse at all cost
1,Second mouse.. same one.  First mouse had double click issue.  Figured I was unlucky.  Second one same issues.  This time only 3 months of use.  Been using Razer for a long time... I wont buy a mouse from them again..
1,This mouse kept turning my pc on by itself everytime I would shut down. Do not buy this it fried my motherboard and now I need to buy a whole new pc and I'm pissed I just missed the return window for this awful product so im stuck with this junk. Please save your pc and buy another mouse.
1,Bought in March 2020 and already getting the double click issue. Very disappointed as much as I want to keep liking razer products but I have other peripherals from Razer that has issues as well. I think this is the last straw for me.
1,Immediately loved my first Naga and it lasted me 5 years before the LMB/RMB started to flake out. Second Naga also lasted 5 years.My Naga Trinity lasted 14 months. Problem seems pretty widespread too. I've been using Nagas for about 12 years but I'm looking at alternatives now.
2,It's only been 3 months of use and my left clicker doesn't wanna work properly anymore.
1,Note to the Executives: Increase Product Quality.Fails the "Does it Function" test.I have had this mouse 3 days. Today the mouse decided it wanted to start using all of the side buttons on its own. I swapped out the side panel with a different button configuration. Now my 7 button does not work.
5,Good
1,I've been hoping the left click of my mouse was only bugged because it kept unclicking when i would hold it down but it seems like it's gotten worse from when i got the mouse. Most likely a malfunction with the mouse's hardware straight from purchase i love razer products but am very disappointed with the quality of this mouse
1,Battery quit working after a few months doesn't even turn on anymore and can't get ahold of razor to help!
1,This was my first time buying a Razor product and I was initially excited about the optional side buttons. However I bought this device in October 2019 and it's now April 2020. The Right mouse button has already stopped working consistently and will randomly stop working during click-drag operations.Wont buy brand again.
1,after less than a month the mouse is double clicking or not clicking when the left mouse button is pressed. my other mice took years to start doing this but the new one waited until the close of the return window to start acting up. i expect better from razer products.
5,Very good
1,I've had 3 razer Naga mice that I loved and this latest mouse is a razer trinity. Loved it until a single click started registering as 2 clicks 6 months ago which causes complications. And @ $80 minimum you would think they warranty a product for at least a year. Not a happy camper.
1,Razer does not state it on their website or on the product but without the Synapse software the extra features of this mouse are unavailable to Mac users. No profiles no color or button customization. This is just a very plastic feeling mouse with too many unavailable buttons. This is possibly deceptive advertising and fraud.
1,These used to be great for mmo gaming I used them for years and years with no trouble.  A few years ago they started breaking after one year of light use.  My latest one died in less than a year.  No more Razer products for me buyer beware!
2,Great mouse for gaming it's comfortable versatile but the durability and manufacturing quality is not very good. I am extremely disappointed that I have to buy a new mouse four months down the road.
5,Perfect
5,great product
5,fantastic.
5,Muy bueno
1,I have had the mouse for under 60 days and not only can I not get the cloud based drivers to work on the device now windows wont recognize the mouse on any computer. I have never been more disapointed from a Razer product and this is my 4th mouse from them.
1,Its a nice mouse but IT FCKING DOUBLE CLICKS NOW so.. I dont recommend this mouse anymore . I should have bought a different mouse . This only lasted good for a year thats why i am making a review since i bought this july 2019!!
1,Had the mouse for a few days. In a typical 5 hour session the mouse would randomly shut off about 4 times requiring me to unplug it and replug it in. This hindered a lot of my gameplay.Reinstalled drivers and razer synapse to try to solve the issue didn't work. Assumed to be faulty hardware issue but can't confirm. Switching to logitech.
1,I'm incredibly disappointed because I received a used item when I paid for a new item. Haven't used the actual product since I'm returning it.
5,Love it.
5,Love it
1,Honestly the biggest let down. The buttons on the attachments will randomly stop working. Not all the buttons. Just the ones you need. And it's an every day thing. To fix it you have to remove and reattach the side piece repeatedly until it decides it wants to work again. It has cost me dearly in many games. And I'm honestly tired of it. Not at all impressed.
1,Had this mouse for about 7 months havent used it much decided to start playing again and the right mouse button doesnt hold work reliably. Even advertised as 50 million clicks minimum. Theres supposedly a 2 year warranty. But I haven't been able to return my order for a new one.
5,Good
1,Had the product just over 6 months and now the 25811 buttons on the MMO optional 12 button side configuration do not work. I have updated every driver and done everything.You need their software you need to hunt for help and you need to replace every 6 months apparently.
1,I have had razer mouses for a long time and usually enjoy them.  This one just stops working.  The fit of the interchangable buttons doesn't seem to be the problem it can go for hours and then just stop working.  It stops working almost daily.  Restarting resetting to default nothing works.  Have switched back to old mouse going to toss this.
2,this is a total pos
1,The mouse randomly double clicks making it incredibly frustrating to work with. I used one of the older variations of the Naga for a few years and rather liked that mouse but this one is barely working after only six months of regular use. Would not recommend a huge money sink.
2,Unfortunately now when i hold down left click it tends to stutter as if im pressing the button multiple times. it can be extremely annoying when you play pc games.
5,Amazing mouse
1,Side piece pops off while playing.Mouse ghosts movement at about 400ms spikes.But hey at least it's pretty and the battery lasts a while...
1,Bought for MAC in September then Razer stopped supporting with latest MAC OS update in November (Big Sur) so no longer able to customize buttons. Customer support horrible about it.
5,i love it
1,Worst mouse ever! Side buttons almost never work sometimes they do in good days. The tracking sometimes bugs out and won’t work. Waste of $200
2,Started double clicking after a month and a half of use. Tried cleaning underneath in case it was something I did but to no avail.
1,5 months after purchasing I am getting double click the left mouse seems to be broken and razerz customers service hasn’t gotten back to me after 2 weeks If it contacting them. I am really sad this mouse wasn’t better.
1,Like lots of other reviewers here my mouse button 1 (left button) is failing after just 3 months. Really frustrating. Trying to get warranty support from Razer but no luck so far. I'll update if they actually follow through.For now DO NOT buy this mouse unless you want to blow your money.
1,No vale la pena el sensor del mouse es malisimo para disparos no sirbe se traba al dar los click
1,Been using razer mice for years.  Every one has failed.  One had a glitchy scroll wheel after a year of use.  Several like this one...have the double click bugs that razer is notorious for. All in all...don't waste your money on razer when there are better mice availabe.
1,In the pic and description it said it comes with a changeable thumb macro pad and I didn’t get that with mine
5,I have had 0 issues with this mouse. Mainly using 2.4hz connection to the adapter which provides 0 latency issues. I use this to play ValorantThis mouse is a little bit wider than some others on the market. It is comparable in width to most MMO mouses (as opposed to a FPS mouse). Given that I have an XL/XXL glove size I found no issues with it.
5,Nephew says it's the bees knees
2,Right click button stopped working after couple months. So disappointed
1,I had a Naga Epic for about 7 years and it was great then eventually wore out and stopped working. Bought the Naga Trinity 7 months ago and after just 4 months it started acting up. Now it's almost completely unusable in gaming. Terrible product. Will never purchase Naga again.
1,I got the double click error Naga was not helpful at all even though it was under warranty.  Go with another brand as this one has known issues and the company is completely unhelpful.
5,Best gaming mouse I bought.
1,Too lite cheep plastic poor accuracy...Such garbage that I find it unworthy of spending any more time on this review.
1,I finally came around to opening this product and it was missing 2 of the interchangeable sides. It only came with the circular 7 button attachment
2,I had it since November 2018 and now it started randomly double clicking. This is my first and will be my last Razer product.
1,I was having double clicking issues with this mouth. Luckily it was under 2 year warranty when I called customer support. They sent a replacement after troubleshooting the bad mouse. Now the new mouse is doing the exact same thing. I wouldn't recommend this mouse.
1,Terrible mouse. Old models use to be solid and last a long time. I’ve gone through about 4 of these in a year. Either the right mouse button starts missing clicks or the left one does. Awful will not be buying any more of these.
1,At first I thought it was because I wasn't using a mousepad or something but I'm officially getting the double-click issue which makes it impossible to click and drag anything.
5,I F***** love it!
1,Stopped working within the month. This is the 4th razer I have owned and the only one with an issue.
1,The mouse does not connect with the software. The lighting and commands sometimes don't work because the mouse and software are not connected. So the lighting pattern changes and I have to go back into the software and reboot it which is pretty annoying.
1,On-board memory was shot won’t allow lighting changes or rebinding. Max dpi of 1000 completely not what was advertised do not buy this product!!!
1,2 months of usage and the mouse looks like a cheap noname mouse. ergonomic of the mouse is awful. I feel fatigue in thumb after playing more then one hour.
5,I’ve had the naga trinity for over 2 years now and it’s been amazing. Does everything I want but I wanted the wireless option as well since I travel a lot and a long cord in a small space can be annoying. Not a big deal really I just want even more convenience because I’m selfish and that overtime I worked has paid off hahaha.Honestly and I mean honestly I’ve never had a double clicking issue. I’m convinced half the people leaving that review can’t work a mouse or treat their hardware poorly. Your mouse broke in 2 months!? Wtf were you doing to it!? My mouse works perfectly fine after being used heavily every day for gaming (and I play League Apex and Lost Ark. Not exactly ‘no mouse required’ games.) for 16 times the life span of yours. There’s a quote that goes “Imagine the stupidest person you know. Now realize half the population is below them.”The trinity has served me well and continues to do so. Never had an issue with clicks or anything and the device is as good as when I bought it besides a few salt deposits from gaming too hard lol. The pro has a good battery in it and rechargability is surprisingly quick. Type C baby. I have it set up to where each game I play uses different attachments and from a long time mmo player being able to access hot keys with the mouse for whatever you’re playing is a game changer once you start. Mouse feels good never had any ergonomic issues even though I have small hands. My buddy with bigger hands holds uses mouse just fine too. Very responsive on almost any surface (be smart obviously you’re not going to get a laser to work well if at all with see-through glass so just get an old ball mouse or a mouse pad.) I’ve used it on wood granite mouse pads of different colors and textures. All good. DPI change is extremely responsive and helps when going from a high to low sensitive game without having to change it in settings. You can customize DPI too. I have 4 settings for the 4 most common games I play. Lights are nice and after 2 years no issues there.Overall highly recommend. I’ll be buying these mice for ages until they stop production or release a better one.
1,No matter what I do I cannot get this mouse to stop double-clicking on a single click. Apparently one spec of dust on the receiver and it causes the click to be too sensitive. I'm not disassembling my mouse every time that happens.
1,Highly annoying to be doing something and you can't drag your cursor or anything without your mouse button double-clicking. Amazon won't replace the item Razer is asking me to send the mouse out for testing prior to receiving placement leaving me without a mouse.
1,it started happening once i started playing fps games which makes the left click usage alot.it may be just me just having bad luck but its still good information and wanting to know the risks it may have in buying this mouse
1,I've owned two Razer Naga's and they've both ended up with a defective left click. This defect has not been fixed over the years and still plagues this product line.I would never buy this product again and regret my purchase.
5,Fantastic mouse.
1,When I hit my left mouse button about 25% of the time it registers as a double click instead of a single click.  This is an expensive product and I shouldn't have to worry about replacing it three times a year!
1,Bought this after my pervous Razer Naga simply stopped working after 3 years.After 2 months the scroll wheel no longer works and the mouse movement is jerky on the screen.Its a shame that Razer follows the trend of other computer peripheral companies; the longer the brand exists the lower quality of their products.
2,This mouse has a better optical sensor but I was getting lost clicks and the side plate will lose functionality randomly.
1,Bought this mouse as a Christmas gift for my husband 2019. It's already doing the double clicking/miss-clicking. It's only lasted 4 months! Not happy at all. Have been using Razor Naga mice for years. Will not be buying them in the future.
1,Listing says it’s Mac compatible but they have not updated the software required for it to work.
1,The button switching function stopped working after a few months. the side panel buttons don't work anymore.
1,This is my 2nd Razer mouse. The first one lasted about one year but the second one didn't even last 9 months. I tried to look online for a fix but everywhere says buy a new mouse. Not buying razer again.
1,Wish I would have read reviews before buying to see such a common problem is always a huge red flag. The double-clicking issue is enraging and not justifiable considering cost of product and the lack of wear on the clicker.
1,This mouse is great. Feels good works good and has a nice weight to it. It broke after 1year. The right click slowly stoped working.
1,The left click sometimes double clicks if you are not pressing it hard.  The button does not physically unclick it just clicks on the screen when you don't want it to.  Friend has the same mouse with the same problem as mine leave this mouse behind.
1,Owner failed to stipulate it was in fact defective. It fails to respond to input randomly.
5,I was lucky to get this mouse at a massively discounted price at Best Buy (placement error that confused the employee and manager after it rung up at a price that the employee who recommended the mouse didn't expect so he offered to let me buy it at the price he thought it was even though I was just going to find a different mouse). I have had it for about a year and I've probably only needed to charge it twice. It's reliable comfortable to hold and plenty of cool lighting effects. This mouse is definitely worth it's price! Knowing what I know now I'd buy this at full price as well. 10/10
1,The program required to use the customer keys on the mouse cannot be installed for mac.
1,After 2 Months left mouse button is working a bit over half the time and it doesn't always register quick movements (I.E. quick 180 turns into not moving at all).Will NEVER buy this again lol
1,It’s a nice mouse and comes with some great customization options but it wasn’t really built to last.  I never dropped it or bunched up the cord but both MB1 and 2 stopped working after a few months of playing WoW.
1,Trying to hold left to shoot in games it fails to counting button pressing down. I try to drag a window across my screens and drops it. Worse mouse i have ever boughtwould not recommend to anyone
2,The mouse randomly registers double clicks instead of single clicks
1,Yep. Me. Less than a year after buying it I have the double-clicking and non-clicking issues. This mouse is now useless. Waste of money. Never buying razer again.
1,i love this mouse. until about 5 months later and now i am getting double clicks on the right mouse button. i have tried cleaning it and researching different methods to fix nothing is working. unable to resolve.
1,The item i received had a major functional flaw. The cable that connects the mouse to the computer was melted. Do you even review returned items?
2,Thumb buttons frequently don't work. Color is perma white for some reason won't change colors when I set it in synapse. Otherwise good tracking and comfortable mouse.
1,nothing but frustration the app keeps freezing and all my macros will suddenly stop working while in the middle of the game!After some reboot it will start working again. I also notice that this issue becomes apparent after a windows update.This product is garbage! it doesn't work well the Synapse application.
1,This mouse is garbage my side mouse buttons don’t work mid game sometimes so I have to take it off and put it back on at times don’t waste your money on this one
2,After using it for less then a month I’ve noticed that it clicks for absoluatly no reason and randomly stops working.
1,My mouse started to double click every time now and it is annoying. Thought it just needed to break in or something but it actually just gets worse and now its too late to return. If this happens return it ASAP.
1,This is my second Razer Naga Mouse in a row. First one lasted 9 months before it started having issues this one lasted 5. I'm switching brands now.
1,After less than 2 years my mouse has started miss-clicking and double clicking. For 100 bucks it should last longer and I should not have to spend extra for a warranty when apparently its a common issue.
1,This mouse was fine for about 2 months then the right/left click could only be clicked lightly to work. Not ideal for gaming. Do not buy this mouse.Mouse side buttons quit working properly after about 1 month.
1,Avoid if you use any other programmable peripheral.
1,Mouse worked okay but was never very comfortable to use. It started double-clicking and making my life hard after about six months. I'm sure I could get it RMA'd and replaced but I think I'll use logitech instead.
1,I bought one of these and 2 of the buttons stopped working after 2 months I asked for another and I kid you not day one the right click button doesn't work 50% of the time. Is this a joke? This much for this piece of crap?
1,Doesn't stay connected and the Bluetooth mode sucks.
1,Have had this mouse for 2 months now and the Right click button is already going out and no longer working correctly.
1,Not worth if the cursor keeps freezing and stops responding
1,Sides kept coming off during play  we returned it and got one from Best buy.
1,Bought it once lasted 5 months. It loses the click and hold/drag mainly I notice in video games. Bought it a second time same issues after 3 months. Never again.
1,I bought this mouse in November of 2019 it is now June of 2020 and the right mouse button no longer works correctly. I have contacted support for a warranty replacement.
1,less than 11 months from purchase and the left mouse button has decided to stop registering it double clicks and cannot drag.
1,Bought Jan 2020 and 3 months later it's intermittently not letting me look around. It stops tracking. I would love to return and replace but I can't because it is past the return date.
1,I had a Naga for 6 years and the Trinity lasted 4 months before the notorious double clicking started. Save yourself the trouble.
1,After 6 months the mouse is already double clicking without double clicking. After some research this is a common problem with this mouse. Wish I would have done some more digging before hand.
1,I have been a naga user for years unfortunately they have seriously changed something with this mouse it only last for 3 to 6 months and 6 months is really high sad so sad :(
2,Dps switches constantly. Even when disabling feature.If you’re trying to game seriously at all I don’t recommend this.
1,Worked fairly well for about two months before I started getting double clicks. Now that I'm four months in its effectively the equivalent of having an auto clicker lock on my mouse.
1,Dont buy it ..u will end up with a faulty right click ... my right click keeps taking me to ADS in APEX LEGENDS and it gets me killed all the time .... the mouse is flawed July 212019
1,I purchased this item in 04/2020 and LMB gave out in 11/2020 worst 80.00 bucks I spent won't be purchasing razor anymore!
1,el click con el tiempo empezo a fallar todo el tiempo hace falso contacto y te provoca problemas en el uso hasta para arrastrar cosas o te abre cosas involuntariamente.es un mouse pesado.
1,This is the third Razer mouse that has either died on arrival or died within weeks of owning it. Absolute garbage products.
1,Trash🚮🚮🚮  Bot this mar29 2020 . Left click stoped working Jan 2021
2,Mouse wheel has a problem.  Very hard to roll and doesnt register the roll sometimes.
1,When trying to click and drag or even just click and hold it just fails.  Horrible when trying any FPS games.  Its basically failing for everyday use in general.
1,horrible scroll wheel for key binding in super lagging
1,I've gone through three of these garbage mice and every one breaks within a year.
1,Sensor is great mouse breaks down in 4 months.Complete waste of money and time look elsewhere for another mouse.
1,I really wanted this to work since I love razer and have their keyboard.  It  didn't recognize the drivers and wouldn't sync.  I had to return it.
1,Garbage mouse. Buttons stop responding so you have to take off the magnetic side plate and put it back on. Kind of hard to do in the middle of a game. Save your money do not buy.
1,You need Synapse 3 to make this more than an ordinary mouse. Synapse 3 doesn't work. Thus this is an ordinary mouse with a big price tag.
1,Had this mouse for 4 months before it started breaking (buttons stopped responding / double clicks everything).Contacted razer support and they did not respond.
1,used since april and it no longer works properly. i left click one time and now it double clicks very consistantly. I CLICKED ONCE NOT TWICE
1,Had to order more because the box it came in was damaged twice
1,Right click microswitch failed in less than a year of use. "Customer support" is from India and doesn't do anything. Stay far away.
1,Mouse broke after 6 months. Razer did nothing about it. Bad product and bad customer service.
1,The 123 keys on the 12 key pad stick and grind. I purchased on sale and didn't open it until recently... The keys on my old 2014 Naga feel much better.
1,This mouse did not even last a year dont bother
1,Nice enough mouse but my return period ran out June 27th and now on July 2nd the it randomly turns single clicks into double clicks every third click or so. Severely disappointed.
1,Scroll wheel did not work out of the box. Went through Razer support for troubleshooting and they wanted me to send them a video of me using the mouse..... Returning for a refund for defective product and absurd customer support.
1,I loved this mouse up and to the point it stopped functioning correctly on its left click
1,Junk own all razor products  and it failed within a week back to my old razor mouse that I had for 2 years
1,Has been a great mice up to this point but the left click wearing out makes the entire $80 mouse worthless...
1,Bought this mouse after my mouse of 2 years broke. This mouses buttons worked for about 3-4 months.  They are now very hit or miss and makes me very disappointed in wasting my money.
1,I ordered this for my grandson for Christmas and the port was broken and missing attachments. Resold items should be inspected prior to reselling.
1,This is the SECOND mouse I've gotten from them and it also developed a double clicking problem less than 1 year into owning the mouse
1,last razer mouse ill ever buy again. double click problem after only 4 months of light use.
1,After a month of use my left click is not working properly and the window for return is close so this was a waste of money.
1,The Mouse would be good but Razors Synapse Software causes issues with most online games making it completely worthless.
1,Broke within weeks of receiving it and then Customer support could not be reached for days!
1,After 2 months of use the right click is broken.  If you plan on using this mouse for gaming its no good.
1,Lasted about a month past the Amazon return policy.  Left and right mouse buttons respond ~30% of the time.  Decent mouse while it worked but this is probably my last straw with Razer mice.
1,Luego de unas semanas de uso 2 de los módulos cambiables dejaron de funcionar sin razón alguna específicamente el de 2 botones y el de 12 botones.
1,Heavy double click trash product gone bad after a couple months please do not buy this.
1,worked fine for a couple months then number buttons randomly stop working while I'm gaming. Have to restart or uninstall/reinstall software to fix. don't buy this mouse.
1,Right click is letting go when I am holding it down and didn't even buy the mouse 1 year ago.
1,Expensive and comes with the double click issue. Don't worry about replacing because your RMA one will have the same issue!
1,After normal wear and daily usage for work/occasional gaming. The mouse has decided that it will stop right clicking.
1,I have two of these. If you get one that works it's great. If it doesn't you're out of luck
1,Side panels didn't work out of the box. Apparently this is a common issue. Not many options in the MMO mouse niche these days but don't waste your money on this one.
1,Button placement is not great. Not enough space between thumb buttons. I would not recommend this to someone wanting a usable mouse.
1,Double clicks after 1 month side buttons never work.
1,We loved it but all of a sudden the sensitivity on it has went way up and now were looking at replacing it only 3 months in.
1,Bad quality not much else to say.
1,this razor only lasted me 1 year and started to malfunction......sad
1,Only used since Xmas and stoppedWorking today randomly. Expensive for a coupeMonths use
1,Software doesn't work can't change color and the colors it provides don't match screen options
1,If you pick up your mouse when your gaming you will not like this.
1,The mouse already started to double click after 3 months use
1,The click buttons on left and right stopped working unless you forced it hard.disappointment  never had an issue like that with other mice i owned before.
1,just work for 15 month and the left click stopped working....
1,Bought used recently broke after a month. Wasnt hard on it. Unfortunately too late to return.
1,I haven't even had it a year and it has died.
1,Way bigger then regular naga and buttons stick out
1,mouse sucks should have gone with logitech
1,First one came broken. Second one came broken.
1,Right clicks on these mice just go. Razer has no intention of fixing it. Buy the Logitech G600.
1,I would avoid this product and look at other ones on the market.
1,When using the left click it will randomly double click often.
1,This company is trash the mouse program freezes and crashevery second. Save your money & buy somewhere else!
1,FAULTY TRASH
1,Won't last long
1,It broke after 10 months.
1,Wireless Mice will read inputs faster than this Don't buy.
1,I got a totally different item(a knockoff) in my package.
1,Flexibility is astounding
1,everything good but the scroll wheel
2,Absolutely loved this mouse. Fit great in my larger hands and loved the battery life. The mouse worked great for 8 months and then wouldn't charge on dock or plugged in directly. Now completely dead. I opened up the mouse and the battery looked fine and everything was plugged in. Disappointed.
1,buttons did not work
1,has alot of good features but cheaply made the mouse scroll wheel encoder gave out after 6 months and there isnt even any replacement parts online for newer models
1,The style and design of this are near flawless. The quality and support are amongst the worst on the planet. I had trouble gaming in simple games and realized that the button clicks were not all registering. When fast-clicking it caught about 1 in 3 button clicks on the side buttons. When selecting r-click/l-click it would delay the response not register the click or when holding it it would release even though tension was not let up.I contacted support and reinstalled drivers more than 6 times sent more than a dozen videos set up a custom video showing the screen and me pushing the button and had it not register amongst hours of troubleshooting steps before saying I had enough.The mouse was so bad that I couldn't open a document on my PC and drag it from one screen to the next without at least 3 tries because the button kept releasing. NOTE: the document was the ONLY thing running on my system was the document (no other open programs in the background).I have had similar experiences with other Razer products. Switched to Logitech mice and not only are they cheaper they are better. I am sure there are plenty of other brands this is my experience.
2,the razor Naga trinity mouse fits very comfortably in your hand or mine at least but the problem is that I had to buy a new one every few months. I went through 3 of these mice because the left click button would be inconsistent. you'd go to click something and sometimes it wouldn't work. you you would hold it down and the it would release. so clicking and dragging was hard to do now. the mouse feels very nice in your hand its just that these mice keep breaking. both the Naga trinity and the basilisk. I can't recommend razor mice to anyone wanting something long term
1,I got this mouse to be able to program several different functions into the keys for Unity dev. It has stopped working after only one year. I am very disappointed. The lights still turn on but it won't work on any computer I own. The tracking light is completely off. This was advertised to me as the newest mouse they had but they haven't updated the drivers for it since 2018 (four years ago).
1,I have purchased this product twice because I like the company and have had minimal issues with their peripherals in the past but both mice have had the same issue. The interchangeable side panels are the first to begin dropping inputs and then the main right/left buttons will begin to quit registering. The 7-button panel lasted barely 3 months this second time. I play a lot of MMO's and the right click was most noticeable as I would be rotating the camera and then lose control of it. Now after just about two years the left click has nearly stopped. Like my headset I'll be moving from Razer to Corsair. Here's hoping the keyboard lasts longer. For reference I play ~12 hours a week - YMMV.
1,Mouse stopped working in under six months razer customer service asked for my amazon invoice no less than seven times. It became extremely tiresome after about the fifth request. They ask you to post it somewhere like google drive or imgur. So I hosted it on onedrive they were cool with that. Then they wanted a video which I hosted on one drive. They couldn't use one drive for video so they asked if I could move the video to Google drive. So I did. Then they asked if I could move the receipt to google drive. Which I did. Then they asked for a full screen capture of the full invoice. Which I did. Then they asked for the full screen capture be sent by email. Then they wanted the invoice in pdf form.I have many razer products I have had no less than 7 naga mice since they first came out. I have had every model I have razer keyboards. Anytime I have a problem Razer support makes me jump through more hoops than I should have too. To get it fixed. And this one is under six months old. I mean are you kidding me.
1,Buyer beware. Read the reviews
4,Bought this mouse back in 2018 when I first got into pc gaming. Though I only really play FPS games  I mainly used the MMO configuration. Never had a problem with the mouse until now. Past few months my mouse started randomly double clicking. It never bothered me too much until now. My mouse is now permanently registering one click as 5-6 clicks. Turns out this is a common problem that will occur randomly in the period of owning this mouse. Some owners have had this problem weeks after purchasing. As for me it's now physically impossible to click and drag anything. Let alone play games competitively. As of writing this I have currently ordered a new mouse by razer though not the same model. When it comes to the customization and comfortability I'd give the mouse 4 stars (hence my review). But seeing the random multi click that which can become a problem at anytime I would advise you to be cautious before you buy this mouse if you are considering the purchase.
2,I want to start off by saying I LOVE this mouse. It's literally my favorite mouse ever and I finally just busted out a different mouse that the wife bought me about three months ago.... I have had probably four of the Razer Naga Trinities in the last three years. Every mouse had the same issue. The clicks would either start double clicking or not recognizing a click or failing to maintain a click as it's held down. Well.... I thought I fixed this mouse just after the wife bought me something else and I did have it fixed for a short while.... but he problem is back.The seven button side setup is unmatched in my opinion and I wish ANY other company would do the same design so I would have more options but unfortunately Razer is the only one I have found to do it.... The seven button setup is ideal for literally any type of gaming imo.But the left and mouse click buttons go out way too consistently to where I can no longer recommend this mouse to literally anyone as you are guaranteed to have your heart broken. The shortest my mouse has lasted me was six months and I'm not even a heavy gamer very casual.It's even hard to leave this review honestly because I do LOVE this mouse....... but I just.... have to give er up.... she's toxic. :(RIP
2,The pre-travel on the mouse buttons makes it rattle when buttons are released. The excess of freeplay in the buttons with no preload on the switches makes it feel like a cheap 10 dollar mouse. I immediately returned it after 5 minutes of use. In addition the software doesn't work unless you create and signin with a razer account.
1,Mouse wheel clicking causes the mouse to rapidly mouse scroll in a random direction (in or out). Totally unusable for anything. TBH I have never been happy with a Razer purchase not sure why I keep trying them out. Probably my last time.
5,The Razer Naga Trinity is the latest release in Razer's Naga lineup. The Naga Trinity brings several new features as well as a much needed sensor upgrade. So lets get on with the review.The design has changed a little. The right and left click have grooves in them similar to the Deathadder where the Naga 2014 Naga Chroma Naga Epic Chroma and Naga Hex V2 has a slightly different button design. The scroll wheel also has a different pattern and feels like a Basilisk scroll wheel with the tension high which actually surprised me. Otherwise the design is the exact same as previous Nagas.Feature wise this is probably the most customizable gaming mouse of 2018. If your an FPS player Moba MMO you name it this mouse can suit your needs because its all of those in one. The side thumbgrids can be swapped out magnetically in under 10 seconds! By default the mouse has the 12 button thumbgrid attached but you can swap it for a 7 button thumbgrid like the Naga Hex or just a set of forward and back buttons. Razer implemented this very well too you can't even notice its detachable when using the mouse. This is truly amazing now you can just buy one Naga and call it a day. No more "Naga Hex" or "Naga Chroma" decisions. Besides that you got the Chroma RGB lighting with 3 zones just like previous Chroma enabled Nagas.The performance is amazing. Razer FINALLY updated the Naga with an OPTICAL SENSOR! With all the backlash from the Mamba TE sensor you would have thought Razer would have switched to optical completely. The issue with the laser sensors Razer used were:They couldn't track pixel by pixel movements very well.They would go crazy when you lift the mouse and had a terrible lift off distance.Had acceleration even though it was turned off in Synapse.The Naga Trinity now uses the Pixart PMW3389 the same sensor found in the Deathadder Elite and all other current generation Razer mice (Except the Atheris and Lancehead Wireless) and the sensor performance is amazing. Handles small movements liftoff distance is almost non-existant and doesn't spin out. Yeah an MMO mouse doesn't require too much accuracy but not everyone uses an MMO mouse for MMO's only. I wish it didn't take Razer this long to update the mouse though.The buttons I'm 99.9% sure they are Razer mechanical Omron switches. They are very clicky tactile and have a nice snap but no accidental clicks. And to all you Minecraft PVP'ers out there they are very easy to jitterclick with! The buttons on each thumbgrid are also very tactile and easy to press so they don't require 3 tons of thumb pressure to actuate like the uTechSmart Venus.The mouse is powered by Razer Synapse 3. In the software you can calibrate the mouse reprogram the buttons change your lighting settings manage your warranty etc. The sky really is the limit with this mouse. And with Razer Hypsershift you can assign secondary functions to the buttons kind of the like FN key on a keyboard. The really is the limit.Would I recommend this mouse? YES! I've tried the uTechSmart Venus Corsair Scimitar Razer Naga HEX v2 and this comes out on top. The uTechSmart has an awful sensor and is made of some form of plastic that feels like sandpaper the Corsair Scimitar's shape is a bit too awkward for me and the Naga Hex v2 has a terrible sensor there's no shape like the Naga. And now that it has a top optical sensor its possibly one of the best gaming mice ever made. Very customizable very friendly. A bit pricey but it worth every penny! Go and buy it!
5,I received one for Christmas and love it. Having some issues with the Razer software recognizing it so i haven't set up the additional buttons yet but I don't doubt i'll have it fixed soon.
5,So I've been using this mouse for the past few days. It definitely takes some getting used to. The scroll wheel loud with a satisfying click that feels very mechanical as you scroll. The mouse itself is also quite heavy compared to the DeathAddder with no ability to adjust the weight. If the DeathAdder feels like it is half the weight it should be then the Naga Trinity feels like it is twice the weight it should be (if that makes sense).Also the profile is also a bit different and take time to acclimate to. While the mouse isn't as long as the DeathAddder the arch is much higher so it strike the palm of my mid-sized hand nearly perfectly whereas the DeathAdder strikes my hand opposite of my knuckles. Additionally there is a shelf for your ring finger on the right side of the mouse that is *extremely* comfortable.And the button plates are genius. I switch out the radial one for MMOs and the standard two button for web surfing and FPS. The only real knock for the mouse is that the 12 button plate is angled in such a way as to be difficult to lift the mouse up. I am *very* used to lifting up my mouse and I prefer the mouse to taper where my thumb and pinkie fingers grip the mouse so it is easy to lift off my mouse pad to recenter. The two button plate is perfect for this and works wonderfully for FPS and websurfing. For MMOs I like the plate with the radial buttons. It is more difficult to maneuver the mouse when I try to lift it since the rubberized thumb pad doesn't taper in so much as it is a vertical surface and you are limited in pressure to the pad of your thumb rather than the entire thumb surface down to the thumb joint. And then there is the 12 button plate that is tapered on a slight angle in the *wrong* direction to make it difficult to lift. Not that it matters too much anyway because the only area you can grip for lifting the mouse is the bottom edge; otherwise you will simply mash the 12 button pad trying to lift it up. I basically gave up on this plate. The buttons are very small and un-intuitive. However the other two plates are a dream. The more I use the mouse the more I love it and the more comfortable it becomes. Switching out the radial button and two button plates is perfect for switching between MMOs and FPS respectively.For big hands this mouse might feel too small. If you want to use the 12 button plate see if you can find a retail store to test the mouse at first because if you like to lift your mouse up to maneuver that particular configuration is difficult to use. And the mouse *does* take some getting used to as it will feel very odd in your hand when you first begin to use it and it is *very heavy* compared to the DeathAdder. That said you're basically getting two different mice that you can hot-swap. This mouse is quickly becoming my favorite peripheral.If you play MMOs and FPS and want to be able to easily switch between the two in my opinion this mouse is well worth the money.
4,I tried updating the firmware by using the software provided on Razer's website (not the Razer Synapse software) and it bricked the wireless functionality. Now the connection between the mouse and the wireless dongle is gone and there is no way to make it work again unfortunately. I searched a bit and looks like you have to RMA it. Unbelievable.  (I don't live in US but I bought the mouse from US store and I have no idea how to RMA it unfortunately.) Razer is really bad with their software/firmware. The Razer Synapse software always finds a way to make you mad. It is by far one of the worst software I have ever used. When it works it works well. But when it doesn't work you have no idea why it doesn't work; and it stops working properly very randomly very suddenlyOn the other side this mouse actually has no double-click issue which is surprising. This was my biggest gripe with Razer mice they always started to double-click after some time (especially the old trinity versions). I am using this mouse since September 2020 and didn't have single double-click issue at all. It looks like the optical switch feature is really there and reliable. The ergonomics of the mouse is top-notch. The price? Too expensive.
1,I owned the naga trinity wired mouse. It was great. I would run into issues with certain buttons not working but always an easy fix. I wanted to go full wireless so I purchased the naga pro. Long story short the mouse is trash. When you connect using the dongle you will have constant cursor issues. When you connect using Bluetooth sometimes it will connect within 10 seconds. Other times it will take forever to connect. It is really disappointing. Razer brags about their hyperspeed connectivity tech but that is the one issue with this mouse! Connecting it to your PC. You can get a $20 wireless mouse from Walmart and have a stronger connection. I really want this mouse to work at least 90% of the time but as much as I hate to say it (I really hate that I have to say it) this mouse is not worth the money. The naga trinity is worth more than this garbage. Don't think I'm downing razer just cause. I purchased their wireless keyboard when I purchased the mouse. The keyboard is awesome. The naga pro sucks though. Don't waste your money on it unless you are extremely tech savvy and have the perfect setup. Even then it still may suck.
1,Always something wrong with razer mouses. Don't waste your money.
4,The battery barely last a day of gaming.
4,This is a great mouse. I play a lot of Siege and WoW and it makes my experience on any game I play 100% better. I've had mine for 3 years now and it still works flawlessly. Never had this double click issue because I wash my hands before I use my pc butbi've probably spilled a gallons worth of beer on it over the last few years and its still in great condition. Sounds to me like these PC elitist nerds just wanna cry about their first world privledges on an amazon review
5,On board memory and self loading drivers!  Can use on another computer without software downloads!  Unapproved software was an issue for corporate IT dept.  With this mouse you don't need to ask for permission/support.Essentially all buttons modifiable with on board stored macros!Assignable scroll (wheel up and down).  I needed that and competitors didn't have.  I was using software that scrolling up/down skipped  but changing to left and right arrows didn't skip images.Scroll wheel left and right tilt/click is assignable.  I find index finger pressure left and right very ergonomic.I would work ten hours of heavy mouse usage.  Index finger distal joint had stabbing pain end of day.  My goal was to lessen index finger clicks or going to the keyboard.  With this mouse I could decrease index finger clicks by 70%.I estimate that I easily saved 30 minutes per day as compared to standard mouse due to assignable shortcuts.Multiple buttons is a workhorse for editing voice created dictations.  Can assign any windows shortcuts.With recording a macro you can make your own shortcuts with use of right click pulldown menus arrow down arrow down arrow right enter etc.  My goal was to avoid going to the keyboard by using the mouse macro.Tip assign double click to a thumb button.Index finger joint pain resolved!  If you have thumb pain the 12 thumb buttons might not be for you.  After usage over 5 years I never had thumb pain.  You might end up bulking up the thumb muscles as happened to me not an issue except when shopping for gloves.I noticed that many coworkers were intimidated by the side buttons.  About 1/3 of those coworkers who tried this mouse found it valuable enough to buy their own mice.  I carried my own mouse in work bag.As far as durability it doesn't seem to wear out.  I have no excuse to get this updated version that I think has some improvements in button contours but otherwise same mouse.I think this is best mouse for work environment where corporate standards don't give you options because no software needed (self loading drivers and on board memory).  In truth I haven't recently researched if competitors still need downloaded computer software but that was the case years back.I have tried two other mice with side thumb buttons.  Aside from an assignable scroll wheel and left right click of scroll wheel the competitors had similar functionality provided it was on your personal computer.This mouse works in any computer you plug it into with macros!  You will want the software loaded on your personal computer so you can modify buttons.As I said profiles are on the mouse.  You can export your profile on computer as file or plug your mouse into a computer that has the software.
1,When I was 10 years old in 2005 I got an old Razer Boomslang for Easter. I have been a loyal fan ever since then consistently impressed and satisfied by their products. I purchased an original Naga in 2010 when I was 15 and used it for many many years before I broke it after my 3rd time moving across the country in 2015 (it still worked the casing was cracked and the internals exposed but I used it for years still). I bought the Tartarus when it was still relatively new I broke that (literally in half whoops) after almost half a decade of use when I moved to Japan in 2018. I owned a BlackWidow at some point that I accidentally spilled a bottle of Jack on again after MANY years of functionality (it still worked after the Jack incident but I got rid of it cuz ew sticky). All of these products had one key thing in common: they all lasted for YEARS and only stopped functioning after severe user error. I never had a single Razer product break on me in any case where it truly wasn't my fault.Enter the Naga Trinity.I have no idea what the heck Razer is doing these days but I've purchased TWO of these mice since they released. Originally I got it in early 2020 to replace my OG Naga which had faulty wiring problems (my fault from being rough with the cord for nearly 10 years). I had my first Trinity for less than a year before it died on me during my move back to the states from Japan - the dreaded clicking issue.The Trinity has a peculiar issue where after some use it eventually stops reading clicks correctly. It will read single clicks as double-clicks roughly 25% of the time and it will stop reading a click if you're holding the button after 1-3 seconds making click-dragging virtually impossible. I'd heard about this problem before but since this was my first time with this issue I thought - okay maybe it was my fault? I *did* move countries maybe it was damaged in transit? So I bit the bullet and bought another.One year later and I've been dealing with the clicking issue for about 4 months and it has gotten progressively worse. I e-mailed Razer customer support about the issue several times but never got a satisfactory response - and frankly I don't really care to anymore. I bought a cheap POS USB mouse from my local thrift store just so I could have basic functionality again and at the same time I bought a Logitech G600 so I can play my MMOs again. It's sad when a company you love begins to offer sub-par products with no customer support. Sorry Razer but you've lost a lifetime fan.TL;DR - The Trinity develops a clicking problem after about 6-8 months of use. You will be unable to click & drag anything and often you will accidentally double-click things you did not mean to because the mouse will stop registering clicks correctly rendering the mouse completely unusable - even for casual web browsing. Razer will not support you. DO NOT PURCHASE.
4,I've had this for a couple of months now.  I knew that I would need to retrain muscle memory to transition from my previous mouse to this one.  That went as well as could be expected (lots of bad moments) but I am confident that I am now faster at skill rotations than I was with my old mouse.  One key to making this transition is when I took out my hot glue gun and added some small beads to the 2nd and 4th row of buttons.  This made a huge difference to me even though it detracts from the appearance of the mouse. Not a worry for me it's a mouse not a piece of artwork.  Before I added the glue beads I found too often that my thumb would get "lost" on the buttons. I've had to replace two of the glue beads already so I expect this to be a maintenance issue.Perhaps your thumb rolled a higher dexterity score than mine but this is what I needed to do to get this mouse to fit my needs.Overall a good product.  Would buy again but I wish they would space those darn buttons out more!  Too easy to miss or mash more than one.
1,Not sure why these companies can't figure out this double clicking problem but i shouldn't have to buy a new mouse every 6 months this one is not worth it
4,I love this mouse for my hand It's only main problem is the profile button. Due to it's placement it's a bit too close to being pressed even in it's divot. I realized it "turns off" the mouse itself on me. W/e the case I would have made that a bit differently so when using my mouse pad it does not do that. (I just removed the mouse pad so I'm fine)It's very well enhanced and the plate switches etc. are excellent for diffrent types of games. Reprograming the "DPI" buttons into proper buttons is possable and reprograming the left and right clicks on the scroll wheel are great. (there is 2 mouse buttons most people don't think about is MB4 and MB5) potentially you can have a max of MB1 and MB2 (left & Right click) MB3 middle wheel click MB4 and 5 (spare keys) Scroll Up and Scroll Down scroll left and right (multi scrolls) and a 2 7 and 12 button key plateWithout key plate switching you have easily 9 buttons on hand and 2/7/12 thumb commands from the key plates. Very soft on the 2 rest positions for 2/7 key plate. using the SYnapsis for soem customization colors is nice especially cause of "Volume reader" which is my favorite feature. Seeing the colors represent sounds make me visualize the sound loudness. It even making me think of a getting a Chroma keyboard for such control. (I own a older model that's just a solid green lights to see in my dark room when I lights off)There is some potential setup problems but I did look them up online. Keep in mind keep your old mouse plugged in to make sure you control stuff well (I keep my old Death Addeler plugged in even if it's not currently supported with the new Synapsis 3)It's a good product in most cases but I can defiantly attest it solid product for myself currently.
4,Ignore the majority of the negative reviews I have had this mouse for a while and it has performed spectacularly. Ther eare the ussual downsides to mice like this but I'll explain in a short blerb.Cons- Mouse finish sometimes makes your palm sweaty. (Varies depending on room temperature)- Locks into synapse 3 (doesn't both me) This is not a deal for me  at all since I only use Razer mice and none of their other products.- 2 button side plate buttons feel slightly mushy but satisfying after a while (takes some getting used to)- 7 button side panel is mildly awkward but just takes getting used to.Pros- Instant easy panel swapping (no need to exit game)- Side panels are solid and don't fall off accidentally (very strong magnets)- DPI buttons are a godsend they feel great and I have big hands so some of you might be worried about accidental pressing. (not an issue)- 12 button side panel is perfectly done. (40+ hours of consistent use) (No breaks or weakening buttons)- Scroll wheel is the best I've ever used satisfying to scroll & click and the tilt scroll function is super solid.- 2 button panel is great and lightweight for shooters.- Size of mouse is slightly smaller longways than the Deathadder and takes some getting used to but overall helps me aim better.- 16.8m RGB very well done and solid. More vibrant than a brand new Deathadder Chroma EliteOverall this mouse has it's issues but we have to keep in mind that for them to be able to do a mouse of this sort things have to be sacrificed to make it work. Don't expect miracles.
4,My first trinity i got like a million years ago.. that lasted me until the end of August.. this new one I got has an issue with its right click I have been suffering for 4 months.. I was able to fix it by taking the mouse apart and cutting the edge off the clicker part following a YouTube video.. the problem is now gone.. I feel like they should implement smaller clicker edges moving forward so other people don't have to take their mouse apart to fix this defect.. Other than that.. I love this mouse.. The 12 buttons on the side are amazing.. everything else is amazing.. macros are amazing.. I love this mouse..
5,I wish someone had told me about how fresh and refined this mouse felt. The cat's-tongue surface that keeps your hand in place no matter how sweaty it gets is great. The excellent and generous teflon coverage on the bottom makes movement easier than pretty much anything else I've used. I don't like mousepads/"mousing surfaces" and my table is covered in all sorts of dirt and goo but it glides like a puck on ice. Smooth. Controllable. Nice.The buttons with their perfectly satisfying little clicks really stood out to me too. I don't know why Razer boasted about the travel for this mouse because the travel is very low and if you care about travel it's kinda pathetic. But the firm resistance and reassuring actuation clicks (they're lighter and subtler than I expected but once you get used to it it's as obvious something happened as anything else) mean that not a lot of travel is required anyway.I've had top-tier Razer and Logitech mice before but none of them had this much thought go into them. It really shows.The software is a pain in the tuchus and users who absolutely need to have claw posture RIP (you'll die of RSI really quickly unless you can force yourself to pull off a "lazy palm" hold) but it's still really good.Also the cable just plain sucks. It's not as good as other Razer cables nowhere near Logitech quality (even my Roccat is better). The cable snarls up and is very stiff. It uses a woven material on the outside like all mice do when they're trying to look expensive but the wires inside are cranky old geezers with bad backs.I was afraid of the optical sensor not working on my all-white desk that confuses every other optical mouse I've put on it but it works fine! All in all a nice surprise for half the price of some of the flagship mice these guys have made.I thought half the price would mean half the quality of a flagship but it's really nice.
1,Had the mouse for about 5 months. At 140 dollars a pop I should not be running into both double click issue on the LMB and a jittery scroll wheel for that much. Mouse is unusable at this point as I use it for work as well as free time game. Buy a 30 dollar logitech mouse razer your quality has drop significantly. Stop trying to make cringe tiktok marketing dance campaigns and get back to producing quality peripherals. When I look at the mouse now all I see is my dog looking at it too because it is straight DOG WATER.
2,If I step away from my computer my mouse falls asleep and takes forever to wake up. I have to constantly turn it off and on swipe it all over the place and flip it upside down. Huge time waste.
3,This mouse is a decent MMO mouse and has a lot going for it but it is nowhere near worth the ridiculous $150 price tag. This is maybe a $100 mouse if that. Why? Because while it comes with 3 sides(which causes the jack of all trades master of NONE syndrome) it doesn't do any exactly right.The BIGGEST and most glaring problem is the mushy left mouse button. It has a relaxed click that makes it feel like it will fail within a month. This OUT OF THE BOX is close to what my old Razer Naga Epic felt like when it was close to failing. It really needs a more substantial click to it. Heck the right mouse button has more click.Second the left side mouse buttons are WAY too easy to accidentally click. I'm not sure what they were going for here but I tend to pick the mouse up at times and move it on my mouse pad but with the MMO 12 button panel I can't do it because a button will get pressed with the slightest pressure. I noticed the other two panel buttons are the same but there is space on them where you can put your thumb to avoid pressing a button unlike the 12 button side.Third for $150 you get NOTHING else except a proprietary charging cable. Yep PROPRIETARY. Oh yea and a lousy sticker.. The included cable as Razer seem to al;ways do designed it yet again to make sure ONLY THEIR OWN USB cable fit into the charging port. There is no using a simple micro USB cable to charge the thing. Then they have the nerve to offer a charging dock for ANOTHER $50 ON TOP OF the already ridiculous $150 price tag. For $150 the charging dock SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED with the mouse.Combine the overpricing at $150 and the soft lect click and the proprietary(yet AGAIN) cable and you have a mouse that is not worth the price.ProsGood ergonomics Nice RGB lighting3 different panelsleft/right tilt clicksConsSoft left mouse clickproprietary charging cable/portleft side panel buttons are WAY too easy to clickOVERPRICED!No charging dock includedAll in all if this were listed at $79-$99 I'd say go for it. At $150 NO WAY. This is not worth it. I ended up trying this because the cheaper wireless MMO mice don't work well on my hard mouse pad(Corsair M800). But having tried this I am about to say the heck with wireless MMO mice and just pick up a Corsair Scimitar and call it a day.
5,Love this mouse. Got it as a gift along with the Tartarus V2 and it has made gaming for me possible (disabled gamer).I love the little buttons behind the wheel that let me change the mouse speed on the fly. Great for when I’m snipping someone at 400m away but then need to deal with someone who’s in the immediate area suddenly.Synapse makes customization simple and fast. I tend to start a new game with preset key bindings and adjust on the fly as I play a game.
2,I have had two of these and both of them developed a right click mis click issue.I use it to play MMOs and moving the camera around is horrible when you have an issue like this.Currently looking for a replacement.. I guess im gonna have to go with logitech..
1,I haven't purchased this but but it does look like a good mouse the price is outrageous though there are comparable mouses on Amazon for under $30 the price should be justified by the quality of the product not whose logo is on it.
4,The size and weight of this mouse is just terrible it weighs what feels like 5 lbs. The entire mouse is plastic and slick so you will NEVER feel like you've got a good hold on it and the slim little embarrassing excuse for rubber grip on the right side is just useless. Overall it's made really well and for MMOs you cannot beat it it's way better than the Logitech G600. But honestly the weight and terrible grip on this mouse hold it back A LOT. Although if you have larger hands none of that should be an issue. Turns out Razer actually sells grip tape for all their mice EXCEPT the Naga go figure.
4,UPDATE: After less than a year of owning this mouse I became a victim of the double click issue with the left mouse button. I took off only one star because this truly was an all-star of a mouse before that issue took hold.ORIGINAL: I was a Razer Naga user before this was released and never thought I'd find a better mouse. However I was always curious about other ones on the market that catered to MOBA and FPS controls. Then this gem came out. Mind you I still mostly use the Naga setup even when playing CoD Overwatch and much less WoW now but I've never had a single issue with it. I never even heard of the misclick issue that unfortunately some gamers are plagued with. I've been using this since release though and it's been the perfect mouse for me to this day even with heavy use.
2,Razer claims to be useable by Mac's but the synapse is useless. None of the software works such as changing the colors and binding the mouse buttons to the keys. Razer has no plans to fix this. I thought the 7 bottoms on the side was a really nice feature but it will not recognize modifiers.  Its getting returned to much money for no options.
1,150hrs? More like 8+ if you are lucky I'm not 100% sure if I got a defective product or what actually happened but the battery life sucks completely. Honestly makes me wonder why I still try with razer after all this time. The last few products weren't the best.. In my opinion try corsair or logitech BT products.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The side buttons macro function does not work at all. The software is the newest version and turning off and turning back on does not work as well. I am still able to return but I wouldn't since I like to mouse in general. Guess I cannot use the 6-button switch anymore.
1,I will state I bought this direct from Razer. So I have had the mouse since mid October 2021 and in the middle of a gaming session on February 22 2022 the #3 key on the side panel stopped functioning.  This is not an uncommon problem with these mice but it usually takes about a year+ to manifest.
2,At first I liked it an upgrade from my old classic razer mouse. then after a few months started getting odd occurrences of a mouse input not registering or holding a button and it releases before I do. rare.. then rapidly became more and more common till it almost stopped working all together. I thought maybe it was just a bad one in a batch everything else worked I enjoyed my first razer mouse. lasted years.. Bought a second one no problems until about 4-5 months in.. same problems now. It's easy to tell when it's going full blown dead as they lights stop even functioning properly.Extremely short life span not worth the money or hassle.
1,The mouse broke after only a year and a half of use. The magnetic button panel on the left side of the mouse stopped registering and the buttons stopped working as a result (i've tried all of the troubleshooting solutions to fix it as well). The old Razer naga models with the non-detachable button panels were great and lasted a long time but this newer model is cheap garbage though. Avoid mouses with detachable panels if possible
1,It was a great mouse. Then the micro switches prematurely failed within 3 months. But the worst part of this entire experience was Razers customer service. Absolutely the worst I've ever dealt with in my life. 2 weeks going back and forth with them and they still haven't put a replacement in my hands.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND. You are not paying for quality if that's what you are looking for. It's not worth it. The device failed mechanically in less than a year. They are extremely incompetent to process an RMA and after a long time of waiting you will receive a refurbished device. So in resume you will end up paying full price for a refurbished device in less than a year. I"M NOT BUYING RAZER ANYMORE. This is a scam.
1,I've had several of these because I depend having 12+ buttons on the mouse. Every one has failed the same way; the right or left click will start misclicking/not registering. If you're going to spend 80$ on a mouse you might as well throw the 80$ in the trash.
5,The Razer Naga Trinity feels really good to use. The mouse itself (not the interchangeable side panels) is smooth with a sort-of grip feel making for a comfortable time. With a side rest on the right side I rest my ring finger sometimes my pinky and both feel nice. The scroll wheel is as most scroll wheels but has physical response to scrolling or touching (which I personally really like). The side panels offer a lot with my personal favorite being the number wheel. I'll use the number pad the least but if you play MMO's I definitely recommend the number pad side. It's surprisingly easy to switch out the side panels just slip a finger nail under the bottom. This isn't to say they'll come off on their own they have a few magnets to keep them in place. Overall it's the best mouse I've gotten and definitely worth the price. If you play a wide range of games I'd recommend it. If you want it for work or school I'd recommend another Razer mouse has the side panels are mostly for things like as mentioned gaming.
4,This has been my favorite mouse since 2015. It does have its flaws though like the "double clicking" scroll wheel died on one. So I have gone through 3 of them over the past 5 years. But the ergonomics of the mouse are a perfect fit for my hand and it's really hard for me to play without it.
4,I first bought a NAGA from a different source on Amazon. Upon arrival that mouse almost immediately starting exhibiting the dreaded double click drag issue. I had to return that mouse.I bought a second Naga and so far its working great. If you have big hands this is a fantastic mouse. Its very comfortable. I love the changeable sides. The back/forward buttons and circle of buttons are the most useful.
4,i like the mouse bc i been swapping between two mice for ever for different genre of games or multitasking  but the Razer naga trinity feels the gap when i switch games from mmo  like wow where 12 side buttons is good to cs go just two or hex with 7 for a moba has what i need to be successful in and out of a game
1,What else can I say. For a company that makes something that costs $150 you'd think it might actually work. But we're talking about Razer who probably spends more time playing with their pretty lights than actually using their own equipment. Their low quality products have caused me SO much grief SO many times and with the Naga Pro Wireless mouse not working now I'm never buying a Razer product again. ever.I have 4 different computers I was able to try the mouse on and it did not work correctly on literally ANY of them.Two of the four are macs one is a macbook air the other is a macbook pro. If the random disconnects don't throw you off don't expect to switch to bluetooth: THE MOUSE WASN'T EVEN CAPABLE OF CONNECTING VIA BLUETOOTH. Putting wireless solutions aside I thought I would try plugging it in with the provided cable (even though the only reason I bought this thing was because it was wireless smh). Nope. NOthing. So either suffer through the random disconnects or don't use the mouse are my options on mac. I tried updating Razer's software reinstalling drivers uninstalling drivers restarting plugging it in while I drew a circle in the air behind my back with my left hand etc... and again nothing worked.Moving on to my windows machines was slightly less worse (which isn't a good way to describe something so expensive). Occasionally it would work fine for a few hours but then the disconnect issue would creep back over and over again. Imagine how frustrating it would be to be playing a game and then out of nowhere your mouse just stops responding. Then it comes back for a few seconds then it's gone again. Again I thought maybe I could just plug it in and it would work just fine. Again I thought wrong because it doesn't function at all while plugged in (maybe once every few minutes it would detect movement for just a second and then stop working again). I have gone through so much grief trying to get this thing to work just because razer just can't get themselves together to make a decent driver (the software that makes your mouse work in case you don't know what that is) for their product. Everything is wrapped up in their proprietary synapse software. So if you want to use any of the features of the mouse (or keyboard or headphones or any of their products) or customize things like lights and their colors and mouse speed you are required to install their software. I would be fine with that if it actually worked but it doesn't so I'm not.Now I'm probably starting to ramble a bit due to my anger and frustration towards this crap company so here's the gist of my review:tldr;This mouse sucks and I wouldn't take it if it were being given to me for free. It has extremely bad connection issues for a wireless device so much that It's unusable and the company that makes it is of no help solving any of the problems.
1,I've tried every single MMO mouse on the market and nothing comes close to the ergonomics and feel of the Razer Naga. However this current iteration of the mouse has one glaring flaw. The two mouse buttons can stop working for a lot of people after just 6-12 months of use. You can see how common this issue is by scrolling through the recent reviews.For me personally the right mouse button works maybe 95% of the time. If I hold down the right-click to move in WoW it will regularly stop working while being held down. I can usually get it to work again for a day or two if I blow very hard underneath the button and click it hard a few dozen times. It almost seems like something is getting stuck underneath. A lot of folks also report that the button on the underside gets worn down and can't reach far enough to actually complete the button click after a while.The early Razer Nagas from 2010-2014 were absolute tanks and I used them for years with no issues. I didn't touch the mouse again until 2019 and these newer versions are just disappointing. If they can fix these button issues I would highly recommend this mouse. Otherwise your just going to have to deal with the buttons having issues. Which is not ideal. If you don't mind the ergonomics of the Corsair Scimitar or Logitech G600 I would recommend checking them out instead of this current generation of Nagas.
3,I would not recommend this to ANYONE at this price. Without the internet it's just another mouse. none of the features work without internet or installing additional software. it's super spammy and pushy about other software the company supports. Amazing how my 15 year old keyboard has extra buttons light support and all sorts of extra functionality all built-in but this mouse needs 2 additional apps and an internet connection.
2,I've owned several Razer mice in the past few years: Deathadder Elite Basilisk Basilisk V2 and the Naga X.  The Deathadder Elite failed because of user abuse (fell off my Corsair Lapboard one too many times.)  The Basilisk was given to my son after a few months because I wanted to try the Logitech G502 Hero (another great louse similar to the Basilisk.)  The Basilisk V2 replaced the G502 Hero because the Hero started double-clicking and has been a champ going on 5 months or so.  The Naga X?Well the Naga X is why you're reading this review isn't it?  I bought the Naga X precisely 31 days ago.  It's basically just a blockier version of the Basilisk V2 with 12 buttons on the side 12 buttons of which are hard to find without looking because they are extremely tiny.  But they were useful somewhat in WoW but I never could get the hang of it.  However I continued to use the mouse because it did have SOME utility.  But today the mouse started connecting and disconnecting intermittently.  I just bought a new computer and I was about to be really pissed at MSI.  However digging through the BIOS I found that the mouse was at fault.  I plugged two different mice into the different USB ports without an issue.  Interwebs research turned up the obvious... a crap cable that plagues many owners of this and other Naga devices.Avoid this POS.  I spent around 80 dollars at Best Buy on this junky turd just to have it fail in a month's time.  Best Buy knows how crappy this thing is and only offers 14 days of replacement.  I took immaculate care of this mouse.  I modded my lapboard to the point that it never fell.  It never disconnected from my machine.  It was never yanked or otherwise pulled in an awkward manner.  It just took a dump for the simple reason of being junk.I gave it more than 1 star only because it worked well for a moment.  Other than that if you're looking for an MMO mouse look where I'm looking (Logitech) because I refuse to pay another red cent for a Naga class product.  Ever.You're welcome for my hard earned dollar Razer.  You're lucky the Basilisk V2 doesn't suck or else I'd shift my whole mouse lineup to Logitech.
3,Do not pay this price for the quality of mouse you will receive. Corsair has the same 12-button side design with a much higher quality material.This is the second Razor Naga that I've ever owned. The first was durable and long-lasting over six years of MMO gameplay before any notable errors occurred. The mouse also cost nearly 80 dollars less.I've owned this product for nearly two years now and the problems are deceptive insomuch as the design of the hardware has changed. It is understandable that the changeable faceplate may wear down quicker and is replaceable but the problematic design is in the main mouse buttons (left-click and right-click).In the previous model the mouse button 'click' mechanism was at the front of the mouse pushed down by a protrusion under the trigger. In this model the mechanism has been moved back. It has been moved so far back as to be behind the scroll wheel. This means that to guarantee your mouse will click hold and stay held you must contort your fingers behind the scroll-wheel for the duration of your gameplay session.Even then the sensitivity is so high that with this contortion you will frequently fail at drag-and-drops 360 no-scopes and any other precise clicking requirements.the result is multiple clicks occurring while you hold the mouse button down if any register at all.
4,Love this mouse points to consider optical sensor and modular side panels. I use this for mmorpg and it is awesome only thing to consider is that if you’re new to this kind of mouse a bit of getting used to is required. All in all superb mouse.
4,he estado ocupando este mouse por más de un año y lo único que me molesta es que para mi mano se queda un poco chico pero el resto es muy bueno este fue mi primer mouse gamer y estoy mu contento de ello.
2,Let me just start this out by saying I’ve had this mouse for about 6 months. I bought it to use as a gaming mouse but I am primarily a controller player on pc so I barely even used it for anything other than homework so it was just an overpriced mouse with extra buttons. While doing homework one day the mouse just stopped working entirely. Keep in mind this mouse had very little use. I’ve tried plugging it in and I’ve tried resetting it and contacted customer support where they told me to buy a new one when this one is still covered under warranty. I promise I will not be spending $150 on a single piece of garbage made by razer again in my life. I feel robbed. If you want something that looks somewhat cool with RGB lights and lasts about 6 months I recommend this mouse if you want a reliable mouse that you won’t have to worry about issues like this get a different brand.Edit: after going though their customer support they sent me a new one as they said this issue happens with “some faulty hardware” I got the new  one about 2 weeks after this review. Last week the new one they sent me had the same issue. With no gaming use other than just using my computer for internet and school assignments. Saving myself the headache for a third time I’ll be buying a different brand.
1,I really wanted to like this mouse. And at first I did. But the Auto Profile switching issue became too much. I have button settings for a dozen different apps and the profile rarely ever switches to the app I'm using. This is a deal-breaker of a problem. And apparently it's nothing new with Razer. Furthermore profiles are saved to the cloud and there's no way to turn this off. This is a problem for me because I have two of these mice one for my desktop and one for my laptop. And the profiles keeps trying to overwrite each other. Do the people who make this mouse even use it? I main day-to-day not just testing them out. I don't think they do or if so they don't use half the features. Battery life is better than the Logitech G700s at least. (That mouse occasionally doesn't auto switch but it's a million times more likely to than the Naga Pro and easier to get it to switch if it doesn't switch automatically.)
3,So I’ve used this mouse for a year now and I’ve never used any other mouse. It is a very great mouse don’t get me wrong. Here’s some of the pros/cons and warnings for different types of gamers.Pros:• Lots of button’s for easy thumb access for controls in-games and for video editing recording hotkeys etc.• The USB cord that runs into the PC is VERY durable. Mine runs along the back of my desk and is constantly rubbing against it as I move my mouse up and down and eventually it will give but for a solid year it has not torn through.Cons:• Not very lightweight. This is especially bad for FPS games that you need quick “flicking” type of mouse movements.• Sometimes the sensor doesn’t work. I have to move it rapidly and sometime clean it with a cloth for it to work smoothly again.• Occasionally the mouse will move itself in-game and my controlling will be innacurately displayed on the screen.Warning:When I built my PC and bought the peripherals my friend recommended this mouse to me. Not knowing anything about FPS games I bought it and started using it. I’ve used it since and have began playing some games at a very high competitive/professional level and I’ve begun to realize the huge disadvantage I’m faced with by using this mouse.Don’t get me wrong it is an AMAZING mouse. I will always use it for editing and other things that it will be convinient for but now I must make the transition from this mouse to a lighter better one for high level gaming.I hope these tips help.
1,Despite the Razer website saying you can save a profile to this mouse the current version of Synapse does not give you an option to do this so the feature either isn't there or is unusable. This is a big deal because it requires you to always run the heavy Synapse software.
5,I bought mine from Best buy 2 years ago and ive been using it every day since. i often switch from playing FPS games like Call of Duty and MMO like World of Warcraft sometimes even story games like Skyrim or Fallout so being able to switch the side buttons so easily is ideal. Its also survived a few hulk smashes from me when i get tilted. I will say this mouse is HEAVY so its not ideal for high level FPS players but the casual Cod player will have no issue. Great for MMO players because you can program the 12 side buttons to whatever you need to in game. WELL WORTH THE PRICE.
3,I  have always been a avid customer of Razer.  But this time this mouse takes the cake.  The NAGA is too small and I am a 5'9'' guy.  Makes it difficult to play all games with it for long times.The side plates have to be taken off and put back on because sometimes there's a bad contact to one of the buttons and one or more side buttons will not work.The left click you can not press from the side of the button and hold for shooting. So many times i have pressed it for auto  fire and i get one bullet come out.  My Left click finger seems to want to move to the center more near the mouse wheel.  The design is just not right and could be improved upon.There is a delay with the side buttons pressing them for peaking in PUBG.  I can not press it multiple times and hold a half arched peak like I can with the keyboard.  Seems to be some ghosting issue with the keyboard or when I reach that 10 key barrier.Suggestion:  Add a small button with the left click for hypershift changingGreat software Chroma is not really needed for it except for removing the green color.
2,I bought this mouse about 6 months ago it worked great! The buttons felt great on the side the clicking was really responsive and the customization worked flawlessly. I'm not the biggest fan of the roller on the top of the mouse there doesn't seem to be a way to adjust it. Also as you can see by the picture the side plates hold on by 2 magnets or something. If your looking for a good mouse I would recommend this mouse. If you are looking for customer service I would suggest going elsewhere. I've reached out to customer service on 2 different occasions the first time the rep I spoke with was totally unhelpful.Here's the story: I used the chat service it was quick and they got to me right away. They asked the basic questions to understand my exact problem. I had lost the number-pad that sticks to the side of the mouse. I was exceptionally clear that I wanted to replace that piece exclusively-I didn't want it for free I was willing to pay for it because it was my fault. The customer service agent let me know there were no more of those in stock and I would have to contact on of the local dealers of Razer products to get the problem resolved. So I did what any normal person would do I asked what part number I should ask for in case they get these number pads in stock (this way if the "local dealers" don't have the part I can simply inquire about it to Razer in the next couple of weeks). The representative then asked me "What part number?"(What did you even look up?? The whole mouse?? Are you serious??). At that point I figured this rep didn't even look up the part I needed and blew me off. How do you tell me to reach out to other people when you a representative of your product won't even tell me the part number? We spend good money on your products and then get blown off by your service team. Not cool.Then the story continues: So a little flustered I went ahead and sent the customer service an email politely asking for the part number of this mouse. I know it's my mistake for losing the piece so I'm looking to buy a replacement part- Not a big deal. I received the auto-reply that they are speedy-fast repliers and I should have a response within a couple days. Wrong. To this day I am still waiting to resolve this issue. Because of this situation I went ahead and bought hyperX headphones instead of the Razer ones (thanks for saving me $100 HyperX) I was originally going to purchase. I'm also most likely going to replace this Razer Naga Trinity with a Logitech g600 and am looking for a keyboard. If anyone has any recommendations for a keyboard please let me know!
3,Good things:- Very comfy most comfy mouse i've used- Excellent sensor performance never twitches lags good lift-off performance etc.- Comes with a 7 button side panel similar to the hex v2.  Why nobody else makes this style i will never know.  It's great.Bad things:-Software is trash.  Online account heavy on your system doesn't work if you're not logged in sometimes.  Issues with onboard memory vs account / cloud memory settings.  Occasionally locks up and your mouse bugs out have to restart computer.-LMB and RMB wear out quick and will start double/triple clicking after a few months of use.  Both of my buttons have worn out even after repairing the LMB once it started double clicking again after a few months after that.  Very difficult repair.  (see pic of disassembled mouse)- Configurable?  I only use it for the 7 button side panel and would probably buy a different mouse if i wanted the 2 or 12+ button side panels.  This just adds cost in my opinion despite how cool the feature is nobody really needs this.If any other mouse was available with a 7 button thumb panel I'd be on it.  But until then Razer Naga Trinity it is...
2,So I had a Naga 2014 that's starting to die & I'm in need of a new one. I was looking at the Corsair Scimitar & Logitech G600. I decided to go the Naga due to my positive experience with the 2014 version as well as thinking I could import the software profiles I had created on Synapse.I was so disappointed to find out the new Synapse software which IS CURRENTLY IN BETA CAN NOT import those profiles so I need to set them ALL. OVER. AGAIN.REPEAT: you can't import your cloud or local Synapse profiles to the new Synapse software.To make matters worse I use this mouse primarily for working with Autodesk Maya Photoshop & Unity3D. Maya has  a ton of keyboard hotkeys one of which is the hotkey combo CTRL + ALT (for select zoom). The current Synapse will not allow for this keyboard shortcut combo.New Nagas are using optical rather than laser sensors but so far no issues & everything has been smooth.Not sure about quality yet since I just got this today.Had I known the new Synapse software can't import old profiles I would have bought the Logitech G600. Quite frankly I'm thinking about exchanging this.Review after ~2weeks thorough use:First and foremost I decided to keep it as I didn't want the hassle of returning/exchanging.Now for the review. The optical sensor is great. I actually HAD to reduce the sensitivity to 3600 DPI for it to work properly with the software I'm using.The side button attachments stay on with strong magnets. I've not had any issues with it coming off.From previous experience with Naga their products tend to be well built & I'm fairly comfortable with the manufacturer's 2year warranty.Chroma feature is nifty if you're into flashy colors.My BIGGEST issue is with the Synapse software. As I've mentioned I use this primarily for productivity- I switch between different software FREQUENTLY.Synapse is still in beta- it doesn't always switch to the software I'm using. I find myself opening the app and MANUALLY switch to the software being used. If you're playing a game this should not be an issue.I'm sticking with a 3 star because Razer should NEVER have released this mouse with incomplete software.BTW: you can also opt in to mine bitcoin for Razer woohoo!Edit: Bought the Logitech g600 when it was on sale. I got fed up with Razer's Synapse. it's now collecting dust in its packaging!Logitech G600 is a better buy!
5,I had a Razer Naga 2014 that I used until I got this mouse. The Trinity seems to have the same durable design. I was actually kind of worried that the side plates would be brittle or break easily but they also feel nice and solid much to my relief. All the side plates work great and I do get a -ton- of use out of the MMO and two-button side-plates especially.As a programmer and game developer it's nice to have a mouse that isn't locked into having the Naga's MMO buttons on the side and also to not have to connect a different mouse if I switch between working in Visual Studio or Unity so I'm not accidentally plugging numbers randomly into my code then having to dig for errors later.
1,I really enjoy this mouse I've been using the brand for a few years now. It fits in my hand nicely the num12 keys at the side making playing MMOs much easier but I can't recommend this mouse to others. As of today I've gone through like 8 of these mice as yet another one breaks and when they work I love them but without fail within 4-6 months the keys start to break leading to double clicking or the keys not registering at all.
5,I have owned Razer mice for the past 15 years. Mostly the Naga MMO mouse because I play MMORPGs the majority of the time. I was suspicious of this mouse due to the fact I had never heard about the Trinity line but this mouse surprised me..The Naga Trinity handles like a luxury sedan. The control is best in class and the accuracy is unsurpassed. If you are am MMORPG player or even FPS and Adventure gaming this is the TOP OF THE LINE.
2,I've been a razer fanboy forever and honestly after this purchase I'm convinced Razer is just using their name to sell a lower quality product at a higher price. I have all Razer perfs and after they all Die I will never buy more. Endless bugs in software that haven't been patched for years Support generally not caring buttons don't register clicks software desyncs regularly (Actually considered sueing for this issue due to hearing damage in the latest headset). To the point this mouse is worse for both click registration and even more desync and software issues then the last one. I honestly cant suggest this to another gamer with out warning them of the numerous issues.
3,Do not buy the Naga Pro for the wireless feature.  The wireless is buggy as the cursor will frequently and annoyingly stop working for a couple seconds.  If you are raiding or doing anything competitive it will screw you over.  Google search "Razer Naga Pro wireless problems".  I downloaded and installed the firmware and it did not help maybe they will continue working on the issue but you never know.It does work fine if you keep the mouse plugged in but you should just buy Naga Trinity if you want a plugged in Naga.  Right now the Pro wireless is a do not buy.
3,I really loved this mouse until the double-click/mis-clicking started.  It just started to do it for me after 2 years unfortunately right outside the warranty period.  I've tried all the fix-it tricks other than taking it apart and messing with the actual switch.  I really wish this didn't happen and I'd buy another if I weren't worried a new one would just do the same thing.  I ended up getting a Corsair but it doesn't quite feel the same and will take a lot of getting used to after 2 years of my Naga Trinity.  I gave "Quality of material" 1 star just because of the faulty switch and I'd give the mouse 5 stars if this did not happen.  It's very disappointing and really wish I could trust buying another.
1,Ive bought and replaced 3 of these mice.  I'm done.  Every single one ran into a left click issue after about a year of moderate use.  The side plates made these mice so convienent but it's not worth the hassle anymore.  I will find a nice product with a similar design.
2,I've owned three of these in the span of 2 years. If you want a premium gaming mouse that'll last I'd recommend looking at other brands. The reason why is in the cons.Pros: Multiple button layout plates make it awesome. The weight was perfect for me and it felt relatively good in my hand.Cons: These are not made of high quality parts more specifically the click switches for left and right click. They will eventually fail by not holding when trying to drag uncommanded double-clicking or just outright not work.. but not after years of use. My longest run was 10 months before problems started.A lot of articles online will tell you to clean them or blow under the button (something about static total crock) but the failure point is the chintzy spring in the switches themselves. After my third one started acting up I decided to forego another warranty return and disassemble the mouse and switches as much as I could and I found the springs are super thin and warp because the button pushes on the center of the spring and not at the contact end causing it to bow and eventually fail. If you're super careful you can caress the spring back to flat and even give it a backwards bow but there isn't a lot of play in doing so. On top of this the contact point on the mouse outer shell button is positioned where you can't reassemble the switch backwards (which would put the intermediate button on the contact end of the spring) so any reassembly trickery is out of the question.Summary: It's suppose to be a premium gaming mouse but the internal parts are some of the cheapest I've ever seen. I've got a 2004 Logitech laser mouse in my closet for a backup which has seen a LOT of use through my earlier MMO days and it still to this day clicks firmly and works without flaw. Until Razer improves their parts' quality to match their inflated prices I won't be buying anymore Razer products myself.
5,I've used the mouse for about a year. I play FPS games and I haven't had any problems with it. The mouse is a little heavy compared to some of my friends but thats what i like about it. The mouse is extremely comfortable especially for large hands but even my friend with small hands enjoys it. The mouse is fantastic and after a year of use it still plays like it just came out of the box
5,I love the mouse. I am a Wow player but I also play League and Shooters from time to time. It's been annoying on my older Nagas to use all 12 buttons for every game so having the options of the Naga Hex and Deathadder are awesome. The quality of the product is solid and the Chroma colors are awesome.
5,Perfect mouse for all tasks but especially for games.
3,I've owned 5 of these mice. They work so great until the left click stops working that I've kept buying them. But the long term cost of needing to toss out cash for another every 6-12 months is becoming too much.  Durability is a huge issue. Some people don't seem to have this problem so maybe you will be one of the lucky ones.
5,I've been using this mouse for 2 years still working
5,The 12 thumb button pad took some getting used to after previously using a Logitech mouse but after I got used to it it was easy to use.  The thumb panels switch out easily and stay attached securely.  I have had no problems with the software that others users mentioned and it was easy to reprogram buttons.
2,First let me say if it wasn't for the infamous double-clicking issue that the Trinity is so well-known for it would be a near-perfect mouse. But alas I'm currently on my third Trinity (2nd replacement) and the issue came up again after approximately 3 months. 3 MONTHS!!! This is absolutely unacceptable when they are asking for a very premium price.Let me rant about the customer support a bit... I haven't had any issue with the agents working at Razer but the process to replace your mouse is painful to say the least. For my replacements I had to...1. Give purchase info (Date Location etc.)2. Explain what I was doing when the issue popped up (As if I was using it as a medieval flail rather than a mouse).3. Inform them of the version of my OS and related mouse software and update both. (Wasn't using Synapse)4. Install synapse and promptly uninstall synapse.5. Uninstall HID keyboard & mouse drivers.6. Turn off antivirus.7. Install the latest version of the Microsoft .NET Framework.8. Run Windows in safe mode. (They must have really thought it was a software issue)9. Buy and blow compressed air under the mouse buttons.10. Make sure MS Visual C++ has the latest updates...When this didn't work they had me take a video showing the issue...After verifying through the video and small library of information I sent them I finally received my RMA#. Yet they informed me that if the technician couldn't replicate the issue when I send it in then I would be charged money. Absolutely insane. They obviously try making the return process as difficult as possible and for that reason I will never buy another Razer product.Razer might have decent hardware but this is not included.
1,Cheap product at a high price and unreliable software. Synapse 3 is the worst software that I have ever used.Mouse is designed to break after warranty ends. If the product breaks before then Razer has a lengthy warranty process that includes a mandatory video then comes up with a way to not honor warranty. It's just there for show.Save your sanity. Don't buy this.
3,I should of took advantage of other reviews and Google but I have been using Razer mice the past 6 years my old naga(2013) middle mouse button stopped working so I purchased this one around Christmas.. Was good for about 4-5 months until just recently the left clicker will unintentionally double click on you when you don't want it to. This happens in a lot in games or when window dragging.. I cant tell you how many times i single clicked a character select in world of warcraft and it entered the game with that Toon.
5,I use this mouse to game a lot and it is probably the best mouse I’ve had in a while. It’s comfortable and has lasted a lot longer than my previous mouse and still going strong.
5,this mouse is unlike any i have ever used and it made me wonder if other razer products are also this good and they definitly are.
3,First and foremost. The comfort and button orientation is by far my favorite of any more. I primarily play MOBAs but it works well enough with other games. I owned the original Razer Naga Hex (6 Button) and I loved it. Lasted me nearly 4 years before the wheel finally gave out. Which is what led me to the subsequent Razer Naga Hex v2 which lasted only a year and a half and then getting the newer Trinity model...which is now failing me after only a year. It's just really unfortunate the newer models are made so cheaply. I could probably make use of the warranty but I'm too lazy. Maybe it's time to try Corsair
5,this mouse fits my hand incredibly easy and I find it very versatile  for those who don' t know the mouse wheel can be clicked form left to right and every single button is programmable I have Play/pause on my mouse wheel click in and vol up on my scroll wheel to the left and down to the right this is an overall very good mouse 10/10 recommend
3,The mouse its self is great perfect weight good construction RGB colors and effects are plentiful. The downside and this is a MAJOR downside for me is the Razor Synapse and Razor Central software package. It is so terrible. The software supports reprogramming all the buttons on the mouse except the left mouse button (obviously) and you can set multiple layouts and name them whatever you want. The software also tries to support auto changing layouts depending on whatever program you are focusing on but it fails every single time. additionally RGB settings are separate from the button layout so they never actually sync up. Finally the software is not very user-friendly.A message to Razor please fix or completely overhaul the supporting software.
2,This is my third mouse.  I can't RMA the others because I'm a tinkerer.. and dissect everything that stops working.  I fixed my 2nd one a bunch of times.  I can't be bothered doing it again (dissect the switch and flex out the spring.The main flaw I see is that the left button can be clicked from multiple angles (big left click).  Depending where you click you slightly twist the plastic.  Next dissection I'll try to add an additive joint between the click and the button so that the clicker is hit dead on no matter what.  Or add something to the very top left tip of the left click to push the plastic towards the scroll like a guide.  That seems to work as well if I stick my thumb there and click.I've managed to ignore it now that I've trained myself how to use the mouse to avoid the double/non click.  You click just to the left of the scroll.The alternatives aren't much better so why should Razer change the design to avoid a headache.  A redesign should have something to unify how the clicker is pressed either by a guide with separated post (like a red cherry switch) or change the clicker switch to something with more surface area at the top and less at the spring within.Alternatives:  Logitech G600 <gave me hand cramps> Corsair Scimitar <had a lot of cheap plastic around the scroll which would eventually stop scrolling  Software would randomly forget settings no auto values on the buttons like G600 and Razer.>
3,If you buy one of these mice just be aware that after 6 months or so you'll start to double click everything with your left mouse button. it's awful. I've decided to buy Corsair mice...hopefully they have a better QA department.
3,I have had about 6 nagas at this point. Why so many? Because they break every 3 months or so; sometimes sooner than that. Individual buttons stop working the mouse hangs for seconds at a time.So how's their tech support? Not great. For whatever reason they don't keep diligent records of registered products and their cases so I constantly have to tell an agent the same information that I told someone the day before.What mouse should you get instead? I'm really loving UtechSmart's Venus and so are many othershttps://www.amazon.com/UtechSmart-Venus-16400-Precision-Gaming/dp/B00FNKMVUO/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1TO9MAHQFLSZ7&keywords=utechsmart+venus+16400+dpi+high+precision+laser+mmo+gaming+mouse&qid=1551748493&s=gateway&sprefix=utech%2Caps%2C208&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1
2,A great concept poorly executed. Low quality soft plastic already smoothing out paint peeling off buttons after 9 months of use. Avoid this.
2,I had a Razer Naga Epic (2012 edition I think) that had the detachable side plates and it was the best mouse I've ever owned.  I bought a trinity as a replacement recently and was highly disappointed.The width of the mouse has changed so significantly (I would estimate about 50% extra girth at the "waist") that I had to change how I hold the mouse from a claw to a full palm grip.  I have a stubby thumb and as a result of the change I can no longer rest my hand on the mouse without my thumb coming to rest on the side keypad itself.  This is problematic because it causes unintended inputs which seem to manifest themselves at the worst possible time in games.  I can't use the mouse in my preferred configuration for productivity purposes as I never know when I will overwrite my cell in excel with a mispressed "4".  Try explaining that one to your boss  "sorry your analysis is wrong... uh... I blame my mouse."This wasn't an issue on my old epic my thumb rested in front of the side keypad.  While the 10-12 row was harder to reach on the epic it wasn't unusable and far better than unintentionally pressing keys when trying to move the mouse.Please PLEASE Razer bring back the old epic.  I started buying up old refurbished epics for spare-parts they're so hard to get a-hold of now.  Thankfully the part that malfunctions the most (the left and right button switches) are easily replaced if you've got some skill with a soldering iron.  (OMRON D2FC-F-7N Micro Switch)
5,If all you want is an MMO mouse or a mouse with a 12 button keypad and a top of the line sensor then this is it. There isn't a better an MMO mouse than this. There is no competition to consider. Add to cart.
3,I LOVE this mouse yet in 4 years have gone through 3.  Right and left clickers going out.  Need to clean number attachment about 4 times a year which is fine.  Other than short life span I LOVE this mouse.  Gets spendy.
1,This mouse is absolutely great.  I love the interchangeable side panel concept and i'm personally a big fan of the round 7 button panel for playing counterstrike.  The problem is i have gone through 2 of them in 2 years.  The left and right click switches are absolute garbage and go out very quickly for a "gaming" mouse.  my $30 corsair mouse has outlived either of my Trinity's by 2 years.  I only suggest this mouse if you can afford to replace it when it starts double clicking within a year of buying it.
1,I actually bought this to play WOW due to the side button options and initially it seemed to work great.  I hadn't played wow in 12 years and this Covid19 quarantine made me decide to start playing again.  From the very beginning I was having issues moving the camera properly and just thought it was me and my noobness to the game.  I bought the mouse 2 months ago.  FYIThe side buttons worked wonderfully I didn't notice any issues except that sometimes my mouse clicks to move the camera were not always reacting the way they should be...I thought it was me so I played thru it(causing many issues for myself in game).Yesterday I am playing wow in a raid ofcourse and the camera issue start again this time really badly.  The next thing I know I have no mouse pointer at all not in wow not in Windows nothing.  So off to google I go...I run through all the troubleshooting guides they all say the mouse just needs to be recalibrated...I can't do that because the mouse doesn't move at all there isn't even a mouse cursor to be seen anywhere but left and right click work perfectly.I unplug mouse uninstall drivers uninstall razor products plug mouse back in windows sees it razor installs windows claims it is all set same issue....no mouse trail the calibration tests fail(which I could only start by using another mouse at the same time).  Although the buttons click the movement fails completely.  I can't find the receipt so I am out 80 bucks on this piece of crap.  This is now the 3rd Razor product to do this to me.  I am furious with this company.  It is a lesson learned I guess....No I am done even trying support even though I didn't even try them this time...waste of money because the design is fatally flawed....junk junk junk
3,Left click on it went after few months of moderate use and synapse software is a major pain with not being able to save presets locally you have to be connected to the internet to get your lighting experience.
5,The ergonomics are beyond comfortable (close to erotic).  There are 3 different thumb control panels  all of which have exceeded my expectations (I play MMO's Shooters and am a Unreal Dev.).Quit overthinking and buy this mouse.  I went out of my way to graffiti my opinion and thou shalt OBEY!!!
1,What other people say about the misclicking and double clicking is absolutely correct. I had a razer deathadder that I used for 10 years until it finally died. I received this mouse as a gift 2 years ago and it started having these issues within the last 6 months. It is SO frustrating to play a game like Overwatch or WoW and end up dying because this stupid mouse has issues. Razer should refund all of us that have these issues. This is a faulty design that doesn't fall on us consumers. You know why? Because the older Razer mice don't have these issues.Razer give us REFUNDS!!!I will be buying a different brand just to replace this junk.
1,The short of it:  Mouse fails at the function of being a mouse.Background: Long time Razer owner of the Mamba way in 2000s days and had that mouse for a long time moved onto Razer naga and had that one for a long time too.  Now this mouse improved on have a more stable sensor but failed in every other way compared to it minus the side swaps.The pros:  The side swaps works as advertised enjoy it.  So why the 1 star?The Cons: The list beginsRight/Left/mouse wheel.  The buttons here feel heavy and slightly squishy even compared to a mouse that came out 5 years ago and to add more salt to this is that the mouse wheel feels cheap as well and doesn't live up to their past mice.Mouse case or feet.  Test with friends mice and past mice to double check this.  The back of this mouse drags and catches my mouse pad enough to have build up on the mouse after gaming.  This is the only mouse to do so.  Past mice don't do this and neither did any others.The rubber pads for hand grips(subjective).  If you have dry hands these will be an awful change compared to previous mice as the rubber is horizontal so my fingers slide on this a lot.  I can't speak for normal or more wet/greasy hands but do hope they have a better experience.  I cut grooves into mine and it solved a problem not present on the naga or  mamba from 2000s can't remember the year in that range.Why not return and be done with it.I am an idiot and put in the grooves into the rubber after holding it for 1  minute.  2 Minutes after making the grooves i noticed the other faults and am now left with regret.Last Razer product i own until good faith is restored.  I got my mouse locally and not on here.
2,Worked well for about a year then the buttons stopped working altogether. Now it's completely unusable. My naga 2014 lasted for 7 years so it was a shame.
1,I had an old MMO Naga which I loved dearly until the buttons finally gave out.  For Christmas I received a Naga Trinity as a gift and sadly it lasted barely over a month before permanent failure.  As of tonight (of course I have to write a review as soon as customer support completely failed me) the mouse stopped working completely after it shocked me after touching the side of the two-button panel (felt like ESD).Now I'm already unhappy as no component should fail in that short of a period of time but when attempting to contact customer service for a failure apparently the only department that can help me is the 'Peripheral' dept which is not currently staffed.  In this case my product has suffered a catastrophic failure and is beyond tech support (which I explained to the original representative by stating that the mouse is no longer receiving power from multiple USB ports on multiple PCs).  The answer? We'll save your information and get back to you.  By selling a product at a premium price I would expect premium quality and if not a similar quality in support.  Nope.Also if you're still reading and decide to still go with this mouse (it was grand when it worked) DO NOT USE SYNAPSE.  I have a pretty beefy gaming desktop and Razer's software is probably one of the most unoptimized pieces of garbage I've ever encountered.  In no way shape or form should a supporting piece of software for a mouse be so demanding on resources.  The old 2.x software wasn't bad but their new release (which was the only one supported by this mouse apparently) was an abysmal experience.So as I sit here with an old backup non-gaming mouse after ranting about the experience I've had with the later gen devices I'm stuck asking myself why I would ever buy a Razer product again.  Part of me hopes that they'll return to great hardware and software support that existed before but I'll ever be suspicious after this last experience.
5,This mouse is an amazing purchase for MMO players. I specifically use it for FFXIV. After buying into the Razer Naga line I was unable to use any other mouse after. When my first one broke I bought another to replace it.
1,Literally dead in 3 months. Ouchie. Skip this turd.
5,OMG how did I survive without this
5,INCREDIBLE purchase. Got the Naga in middle school to play video games. Wasn't cheap but has been beyond worth it. In college now working on a startup. Still works perfectly every single day.
5,I've used these for years
2,I found this mouse hard to use!The buttons on the 12 side are way to small and hard to tell which one is which without looking at it. It's also really hard to lift off the pad without dropping or pressing buttons and then you have to adjust after every lift. The buttons are way to far back as well making the back buttons hard to press at all. And lastly it will not let you assign standard mouse forward and back buttons to any of the side buttons!The circle button side is completely worthless in my opinion. Again it's awkward to hold and slips out of my hand when I try to lift it and moves around when I try to push a button. Again can't assign forward and back buttons.The forward and back plate would be worthless if razer would let you assign one of the other buttons on one of the other side as forward and back buttons but they won't. I guessing because they want you to use the last side which you'll end up loosing or breaking at some point. Definitely not a good travel mouse at all.Overall this mouse doesn't have a lot of good qualities to it. It's to small for what they tote it as. The buttons and whole mouse need to be bigger with and easy way to lift it without dropping it. It's absolutely worthless if you drop it off your mouse or have to stop and pick it up carefully while trying to turn around fast in game. It's to rounded and needs some groves on the side to be able to pick it up.
3,My buddy recently purchased this mouse. It has excellent response time an would recommend to any gamer. Due to the exceptional feel an durability. I am currently saving up to make my own purchase soon.
1,I’ve purchased two of these mouses and I’ve gone through 4 of their keypads.  They all eventually fail. With the mouses it’s always the left click it simply won’t read or will double click. For a mouse that costs almost $200 they should make them much sturdier
2,That ring finger rest kills my hand. I'm a finger gripper and that s*** is in the way and terribly uncomfortable for me to use. I have had two Naga Epic Elite's and my last one is wearing out. Just wish those were back on the assembly line. Those you could customize with your grip style on the right side of the mouse. I love all the MMO buttons on the side. Those help with all kinds of games if you prefer to keep your directional fingers moving on your left hand while the mouse hand is switching weapons and chunking grenades. I'm probably going to try the Basilisk V2 for comfort. I will miss my MMO mouse buttons tho. Darn you Razer!
2,Let me preface this with the fact I've had alot of Razer mice. Starting with the 2014 Naga aNaga Chroma and now the Naga Trinity. I've loved them all.The build quality has gone down hill. A mouse that lasted 3yrs and was easily repaired now barely makes it to the end of its warranty. Every mouse I have owned from Razer (except the 2014 original which made it into the third year) has gone wrong 2 months after the warranty ended (2 years).So here I am telling you I'm about to order a Corsair Scimitar because I'm sick of these $100 mice dying as soon as the warranty ends to make you buy another.I'm typing this having just tried fixing my Trinity 2 months after it's warranty expired and now lost the f'in little metal clip for the right click. So now I have 3 dead razer mice no working mouse and no intention to ever buy Razer again.Ps - mostly been left/right click misclicks/no longer holding which is fixable if you have the patience... Until it just stops responding all together.
1,The razer naga has been my go to mouse since 2013 i have had 3 of the mice since then. the most recent one (and the reason i am leaving this review) was a gift for Christmas. First lets get the product itself out of the way:Pros:ergonomics are great i have smaller hands and it always rests perfectlyNew face plates on the sides are perfect for modularityDPI switching is great as alwaysMMO pad for me is a mustCons:the software for it is kind of spottysupport is TERRIBLEAfter a bit I had an issue with the mouse double clicking and not holding down the right click. not a big deal devices fail and are mis-manufactured occasionally and that's what the warranty covers. I go to Razer's support site and they make it pretty difficult to get support the site says that the mouse is no longer under warranty even though it was. No big deal maybe the site can't detect the exact date a mouse is purchased. They make me fill out a long form in order to get support I list all of the issues that I have and all of my troubleshooting steps. I tried everything from using it on a different computer reinstalling windows reinstalling razer's software updating razer's software completely removing and reinstalling the mouse driver and even trying the mouse on a computer with no razer software. I think it is safe to say that i tried everything possible on my end already I even mentioned that this is a wide spread issue mentioned online having to do with the micro switch which is a hardware issue. Still i get ran through the ringer of trying the more basic troubleshooting that I have already performed. I work in tech support so I know that these steps must still be performed to ensure that they were actually ran this is fine for now. The only thing that is not fine is the response times I would only be fed a couple of troubleshooting steps and questions at a time in an email with only a single response every 24 hours. Not only that but the technician that was assigned to me was referring to it as a headset and not a mouse. Also I was asked if I could open up the mouse myself and investigate the issue. This is not a very simple task for a micro electronic such as this mouse. Keep in mind that I am (almost) hard down and not able to play games until this issue has been fixed. in a couple of days they ask for my address to ship a replacement (yay!) I swiftly reply in under 6 minutes with the information that they need to ship an RMA. They seem to have an issue with the proof of purchase (which was asked for in the beginning) and have not mentioned it until now. I received the item as a gift and it was difficult to get them the correctly formatted receipt that they wanted but alas here we are 5 days into my case. They have my shipping information my receipt and all is well. Then they ask for a demonstration of the mouse's issue (???) before they ship out the mouse. even worse they want me to record myself demonstrating the issue via a video on my phone recording the razer mouse itself and the issue on my screen. This is a huge obstacle since the issue is difficult to physically demonstrate and the site they linked me to test it on isn't very good at demonstrating the issue. also they wanted me to share a link of the video on my personal google photos which feels like a breach of privacy. the less technically inclined could share more with them than they initially intended also this is such a big ask of me especially since the issue is widespread and well documented. You would think they would be more lax with issuing repairs for this issue in specific. I get a notification that they have opened the video on google photos they email me back and say that they will be issuing a replacement for real this time. Then I get an email asking for my home address and shipping information AGAIN this is even more annoying since I only get a single response a day. This means that my entire RMA has been delayed by yet another day alas I send my info and await a shipping label. Wake up the next day to an email with a shipping label (yay for real this time! right?) well yes and no. This RMA is very slow and comes with so many asterisks. Let me run you through the ringer of what things will cause your RMA to be completely cancelled if not done correctly:If the RMA is not clearly printed on the outside of the box it will be cancelledIf the reason that your mouse is having issues is not PRINTED on the inside of the box it will be cancelledIf the warehouse does not receive the box within 14 days then it will be cancelledthe box will take 1-2 days to reach their center processing it will take 3-5 business days I have been without a working mouse for 9 days. before they even ship my replacement it will be about 2 weeks without a working mouse for a WELL KNOWN hardware issue. Because all of this warranty RMA nonsense I went out and bought a logitech and i think I will be going with them from here on out. When I first bought a razer naga it had features that no other mouse had. But now every mouse has them and i find the razer products to be overpriced. I stuck with them for some times because I liked having a single mouse design instead of hopping mouses every couple years.
1,I bought the Razer Naga trinity as an expedient replacement for my 6-year old Corsair which was failing because the wire coming out the end finally started to breakdown causing intermittent connection issues My choice in razer so far has been a bad one as evident by my razer headset and mouse though the mouse is worst of the two.Currently it double clicks when I only single click or does not click at all also the right mouse button does not even click like the micro switch is stuck. also the eye seems like mow quality the cursor movement does not match the mouse movement and even stutters a little it's not extreme enough to notice easily but has caused some problems in rapid movement.For the design I am displeased as well for me personally at least. since the paddles extend really far up past the top arch of the mouse when you rest your palm on the top and move your hand across it can cause the paddle to depress enough to click a button causing things to happen when you don't want too and because of this I grab the mouse higher than I normally would on the side and end up clicking the side buttons and end up moving forward and backwards on web pages a lot this second half is for my personal experiences only but might provide some insightall in all this mouse is going in the garbage and I'm going to look for a new one.
1,I was excited to get this product until I had the misfortune of plugging it into my computer the first time. RAZER makes you use their program called Razer Synapse 3 for all their devices. This mouse would not come up in their program so I was unable to utilize any of the customizable features. I spent hours researching a fix to no avail. I contacted their text support and spent an hour on chat with them doing the same.They forwarded me to a higher tech support who only communicate by email. After two days of trying to send them a 3mb file which they claimed was to big for them to open and finally resulting to having to send them a google drive link. They responded with "Please be informed that we will forward your case to the appropriate team for you to be further assisted. Please expect an email within 48-72 hours from now for further instructions."I'm tired of trying to figure out a program that should be the first thing that works with this company. I've had problems with RAZED Synapse 3 in the past where it sent my computer into an endless cycle of crashing to which they responded with "That's really a bummer. We get how difficult it is to get anything done with the current situation. Anyway stay safe and have a good one."I will never use a RAZER product again. Worst customer service ever. I would not recommend a RAZER product to anyone.
2,I got this off of the actual site and this mouse has given me nothing but enormous intermittent disconnect issues where it will disconnect for about 1 second and then reconnect.  Obviously since I spent most of my time playing shooters this is a massive issue.  I tried to get it replaced but after contacting their support they basically wanted a doctorate dissertation full of diagnostic steps involving trying to retro certain drivers and a plethora of other things.  I've only tested this at the 2.4 ghz setting I haven't tried using the bluetooth but this issue can/has happened when my mouse is plugged in and charging and the USB nub is plugged into my computer which is literally 13 inches away so it better not be some wacko distance issues.  It's also been plugged into my USB hub which is a mere 8 inches away maybe my desk is just cursed who knows. I gave it 2 stars because the side panel swap thing is still supremely dope if only the mouse actually functioned!
1,had to replace 2 of these within 6 months both of them had the same failure. the side buttons start to fail/stick. moved to a corsair now :(
5,I use this for gaming and work on my PC laptop and Macbook Pro. It is a fantastic mouse.
5,it felt very premium
1,It's only a matter of time before the left mouse button will start double clicking/not click at all; in my case it took just around 6 months for the issue to appear and it got progressively worse over time. The mouse is now unusable for this reason. For the amount you are paying this is unforgivable (especially for how well documented this flaw is across all razer mice i had this issue on my deathadder and abyssus as well). Listen to the most helpful reviews and stay away from razer mice in general.
3,Claw grip users do not buy this mouse its not comfortable for that grip.
1,A decade ago I bought my first Deathadder and it was fantastic but eventually crapped the bed.  Then I got my first ever Naga and that worked flawlessly until my cat tripped over the cord one too many times and flung the mouse around one too many times.So after the original Naga which I still miss today I see this new Naga Trinity and was super excited to see the new different interchangeable plates.  However my first mouse died within the first couple of weeks outright.  No USB power to the mouse at all after 2 weeks so I called Razer and they sent me another one.  The 2nd one I received worked for less than a month and it started having the double click problems that everyone else mentioned here.  Then that mouse completely died eventually as well.....So it seems like Razer has lost their touch with this new Trinity which is just a shame.  I wish they would go back to the regular Naga which I never saw any problems with at all (just my own negligence in taking care of it).  Highly highly recommend you stay away from this mouse.  While it did perform beautifully in my MMO games and it fits in my hand perfectly it was extremely short lived TWICE.  Never again will I buy the Naga Trinity.  Blowing in the space underneath the left mouse button worked very temporarily and was not a permanent fix.Avoid at all costs.
5,Bought  mine at a retail store but by far the most comfortable mouse i have ever used!
1,Background:  Ive been using Razor product since 2008. There products have always been great for overall functionality. Ive had a few hiccups but usually after the items use. This was my second Naga  as the first scroll wheel just sort of wore down after 5 years of use. Overall my favorite mouse of all time. My replacement was the Trinity. It continued to be great. Then the left click started to go and eventually would only click 1 out of every 3 clicks all within the first year. No big deal. I understand. Mechanical items sometimes have issues.The bad:After all this i contact Razor support and let them know my mouse is broke. Oh mother of god. Razor's support killed it for me. They send you emails asking the same 6 questions over and over again all while taking 2 weeks to ask it again every time.Not only that but the questions they ask are so cookie cutter it proves they are not reading the problems... Can you video the problem? I told you the left click isnt working... so you want me to record my screen not clicking??? Try reinstalling synapse... ok done... ok lets try it again ... why???Back to good ol logitech. Not as comfy for the hadn but I love their service.(Logitech replaced a faulty key on a keyboard they sold by overnighting  me another and asking for the one I claimed had an issue back). So yeah last Razor buy...
1,I had one of these for two years and right after the warranty was expired the battery swelled up. I came home one day (home temp was being maintained at a healthy temp mouse was kept on the charger dock with PC turned off (no power) and out of sunlight). I noticed that the bottom of the top cover was broken off with the plastic (normally glued-in not meant to be removed) which was where the battery pack was. The LI-Ion battery pack had swollen to the point where the plastic broke off which is very dangerous. LI-Ion batteries which have swollen are at risk of explosion if punctured or subjected to a large enough shock. I do NOT recommend buying any rechargeable product from Razer for this reason as clearly their quality control is not there. I won't be buying any more of their products again.
2,I really wanted to like this mouse because I am a huge Razer fanboy and I have only bought Razer products a Razer DeathAdder Naga Blackwidow headset and then I replaced the naga with this one for the interchangeable side buttons and I've had it for about 4-5 months and it's left button just stopped registering that I was clicking it. Like I would play Dead By Daylight and mid gen repair my character would just stop repairing the generator as if I wasn't holding down M1 same with healing/pulling people off hooks and it broke my heart to see that it was a common issue so I decided to just replace the mouse with a Corsair Scimitar Pro and it works so much better than this mouse. Hopefully Razer can fix this problem so I can use this mouse once more.
1,I bought mine from a store and I regret getting it. I only got it because my razer naga is hitting six years and I figured it was about that time to get a back up. Yeah 6 months in and the back up mouse is unusable forcing me to go back to my 2014 mouse.The two biggest problem for me was the constant double clicking rendering the mouse useless and the size. I have small hands and the 2014 naga is a great fit for me but the naga trinity is too big. I can barely reach the top buttons and my finger just barely reaches the near the lower portion of the scroll button.As for the double clicking: it started 3 months in but wasn't so bad that it made gaming impossible. Should have chucked it out 3 months ago. It is constantly double clicking now and no amount of taking it apart to physically fix it has worked. I've stopped using it after the double click made me accidentally discard a weapon costing upwards of several million gold.I'm sad to say this but I'm done with razer. After my 2014 naga officially kicks the bucket I will be moving on to a different mouse.
2,I love the features of having a single mouse with the interchangeable side configurations. It makes it so I don't have to have at least 2 mice for my different habits. The changing of side-plates is super simple and I've personally never had any issue with Synapse 3 that I have noticed.Now for the bad. The click mechanisms for LEFT and RIGHT buttons are horrible. My first failure happened about 8-months after first getting the mouse. It was the RIGHT button. I contacted support and after some troubleshooting Razer supplied a replacement (had to send my mouse back first). Got the new one about 4-5 months ago. In the last couple of weeks my LEFT button is now having the same issue. I'm sure Razer support will be great and get a replacement to me but that's another few weeks until that is all settled. It is frustrating. I have loved my Razer hardware for well over 15 years now but my experience with this mouse has not been pleasant.
1,I had this mouse for less than 4 months before the dreaded "Double clicking" (aka click bouncing) started happening. Razer knows these have faulty switches yet makes insane demands so getting a RMA to do an exchange is impossible. I have been trying to get a return initiated with them for several weeks at this point.While there are some software tricks that can be used to improve the behavior the fault lies in the switches that are used for these mice so any fix is just a band-aid that results in lag and unsatisfactory product performance.Do not buy same your money and pick up literally any other mouse (including an old school IBM mouse from the 80s).EDIT: They finally sent me a replacement mouse - very poorly packaged and in a crushed box - that has been packed and stored because I was moving. I just opened it and started using it on 9/3/22. I will see how long this one lasts. (But it's not looking good. On day 1 the number pad stopped working mid game and I had to take it apart and put it back together.)
1,The quality and life expectancy has constantly decreased with each model for the Razer Naga over the years. I already feel like a sucker for sticking with this company for so long. The first mouse I got back in 2009 lasted 2.5 years until it just stopped working all together the next lasted 1.5 years with double clicking issues for half of that time and the next lasted 1 year with double clicking issues for half the time. The next model I tried was the wireless model which stopped working without a wire within months and then got the double clicking issue after about a year. The next mouse started double clicking within months and the side buttons occasionally didn't work (I still used this broken mouse for about a year). I decided to give Razer one more chance at this point and the next mouse I received all the side buttons stopped working after months. I reached out to Razer this time sent in the broken mouse for a replacement (the only available Naga model was Trinity) and after a couple weeks I received the Trinity. This Trinity mouse is the worst they have released. Within weeks the side panel constantly cuts out during gaming. In 15-25 minute mmo dungeons the side buttons will stop lighting up and working a minimum of 20 times for 2-4 seconds at a time. I will be looking for a replacement 12 side button mouse brand soon as this mouse is unusable for gaming.
1,So let me start by saying I have loved naga mice in the past I use to recommend them to any and all who asked. I had the molten that lasted me over two years. So when when it finally went out after years of heavy use I was happy to give naga my money again and buy what I thought would be another great mouse boy oh boy was I wrong. This mouse is cheap garbage. I received two of these mice. One i bought for my self and the other a Christmas present. So one for use and one back up. The first lasted about 2 maybe 3 months before the left and right click started to either double or triple click and the tracking started to fail. I cleaned the mouse out after watching some DYI's on mouse cleaning and yet it still was malfunctioning. So I thought maybe just this one was faulty and used my back up and after about 2 months THE SAME THING OCCURED. Which leads me to believe they're just faulty and or poorly made Save your money and your time look else where for quality because naga has lost theirs.
1,So I have used the Razer Naga ever since it was first introduced. The first one I owned lasted me YEARS and I loved the thing. It eventually died out and I got one of the newer versions. These are complete garbage! I have gone through 3 of these in like 2 years now! The first one had the right mouse button actually just snap off. I have never seen anything like that in my 25+ years of gaming! The second one became non-responsive after just three months and the last one I had lasted about 8 months. One of the side panels didn't work but I didn't care since I was after the 12 buttons for MMOs but now my right mouse button isn't registering properly. I will hold it down to move the camera in WoW but it auto releases itself whenever it wants. I've seen people saying the same thing so now I know there is something really wrong with the design.TL;DR  This mouse is garbage and Razer is using cheap parts now. Don't waste your money!!
2,By far my favorite mouse I've ever used. It fits my hand very well and it extremely responsive. Unfortunately they just don't make them like they used to. My old naga lasted 4 years of frequent FPS gaming. I've since gone through THREE (3) Nagas in the last year alone. Within a few months they all started double clicking right click does not stay activated and sometimes the left click doesn't even register. Razer clearly cut some corners in manufacturing and has since started selling garbage products for the same ridiculous $70. Get the Logitech g600 for half the price or a corsair scimitar. I will never buy another razer mouse again.
2,I got this mouse in may of 2019 and I'm getting the double mis click issue as a game developer who needs precision when working with assets its extremely upsetting when the left click shorts out.Another thing that is inconvenient (might just be me) is razer synapse To me when I power my PC on I shouldn't have to log in every time i want my lights to go to red especially when I click keep me logged in (same with my razer keyboard.)Overall I would not ever recommend anyone buys a Razer product. (Ive had 1 headset 2 mice and 2 keyboards and they were all less than two years old before going bad)
1,Within the first month of use had the right button not stay clicked down (very evident in WoW with camera movement). Sent it in and got free repair on it got it back and now after a few months the left button is way too sensitive. For example I click down the button but lift off very slightly (without triggering the upwards click from taking my finger off) it will still unclick.Been mainly playing PC since 2013 and been through a few $20-25 dollar mice from off-brands that have never had this issue (they still work fine too was looking for something with more adjustable DPI) . Picked this up on sale for $50 and I still feel ripped off that Razer can't ship a mouse with working buttons.Also a shame because I genuinely like the shape of the mouse (I'm palm grip) and I feel it has a good weight to it but I can't overlook something as big as mouse buttons not working correctly to keep using it.
1,Got this for fortnite. Used it only a handful of times swapped the side parts out from the circular 7 button piece to the standard 2 button piece and it never worked right again. The Razer software wasnt recognizing any inputs from the side buttons at all. So we swapped back and all 7 which were all keybound and working perfectly no longer worked. Checked the software and all the buttons were registered and still assigned to their original binds but none of them would function. Tried to use the larger and a bit clunky 12 button side with the same result. Shortly thereafter we realized the chroma lighting wasn't lighting the palm piece only the scroll wheel. Obviously we then returned the mouse for a refund.I would NOT recommend this mouse and I am an owner of 2 razer headsets a keyboard mouse and mouse pad. So obviously I typically like their products.A review of the product when working is also rather negative as well. While 7 buttons is just right - wall ramp floor edit auto run pickaxe and roof were all bound to the 7 buttons - the circle just doesnt feel right in hand and while I didn't get much of a chance to get used to it it just didn't feel right. In fact I was relieved when it broke because I was no longer stuck with an expensive mouse that wasn't perfect.Take a pass on this. Logitech and numerous other companies offer much better solutions. I still LOVE my Death Adder but it only has 2 side buttons and thus most of the keybinds are now keyboard based instead of on the mouse.
1,First Razer product to real fail me which is sad because I used to love this company. The mouse will click when moving it up and down to recenter causing all sorts of problems when gaming. It's like the spring gets weak when it warms up or something. I reported this to Razer they try to make you go through all sorts of troubleshooting steps that have nothing to do with the problem and when that fails to resolve it they want to make you prove it via video. The company doesn't even trust its customers. I got the mouse as a Christmas present and was super excited but now I need to warn others. It's only 30 days old and having issues. The customer support will treat you poorly. They are more interested in preventing you from RMA'ing your mouse than keeping you as a customer. And yes I sent them video proof just to show the issue but I won't be a customer anymore. I've purchased another mouse.
1,So Razer provides a warranty on their mice for up to one year. As many have indicated after a few months many of these mice develop issues with left clicking or in my case right clicking stopped functioning. I contacted Razer to do a warranty exchange. Here's the problem...Razer requires you to send the old mouse to them FIRST before they will process and issue a replacement.  That effectively means that for weeks you will go without a mouse to use. When I brought this to their attention they simply indicated that this was their policy for warranty replacements.I will never purchase another one of their products.  When my Logitech gaming headset stopped working Logitech had a new one at my house within a week and told me to keep the old one as part of the inconvenience. I'm not asking for that. But to send my mouse making my computer useless for the time being or forcing me to try and locate a new mouse (at a time when all the stores are closed due to Covid-19) is ridiculous.
1,Have it for less than 2 years and it already is giving me the "double-clicking"  problem. I do not smash mouse buttons or get triggered on games have been careful with this mouse as I am with my whole rig and acessories. Unfortunately Razer quality in general has just gone from low to worst. This was my last Razer product there are other options out there G600 Corsair (which seems to have the same issues as naga) and some cheap brands that are actually doing a better job the Razer.
2,Absolutely enormous mouse.  Compared to the Razer DeathAdder this mouse is 2" longer and about 1" taller.The design of the mouse buttons puts the lever way up near the cord making a normal grip impossible and require 10x more pressure to click down.  Kinda like trying to close a door from the hinge instead of the door handle.The switchable buttons are really cool.  The lighting ties in immediately to other razer products once you download their application.Overall I can't give this mouse a good review.  it is simply TOO HUGE to be used by 90-95% of the world.
2,Like others mine has had the double clicking problem as well and I'm so dissatisfied with the product because I'm sure it's a software issue and not one with the mouse buttons it's self I wrote my original review last year and I can definitely say razer has not got any better compared to the original 2014 naga
2,I have had two of these mice and BOTH of them had the double click problem which appears to be a design flaw for the mouse. Also the mouse seems to change sensitivity at random as well but i can live with that. This should not happen on a 100 dollar mouse. I gave it two stars for when it does work it works great for gaming which if your lucky seems to be 6 months
1,My first Naga Trinity came with left click ghosting issues. When holding down left click it would randomly "let go" without my letting go causing double clicking instead of dragging.My second Naga Trinity came with the exact same issue but on the right click instead.My third Naga Trinity died after a month. As in you plug it in the power lights up for a few seconds and it works fine then all lights turn off and the mouse no longer responds. It's dead.My fourth Naga Trinity out of box has a broken scroll wheel that's apparently a common issue. If you spin it fast it works. If you try to mouse wheel down slowly or one "click" at a time it locks so hard that you end up pressing MMB from the force necessary to scroll.I have lost 4 of these mice within 3 months.The quality of this product is horrid. It's a waste of time and money. I wanted to love it because I really adore the hex layout but the cheapness of this product is evident and it's not just one piece it's everywhere.
1,Pros:Looks cool.Feels nice when the buttons work.Would be just amazing in theory if things worked.Cons:-Left-click gives out as early as after 1 month's use. Click will not hold down sometimes will not click at all sometimes will double-click when you click it once. Never know what you're going to get when you try and click something.-The software you are forced to use to make use of this mouse (Synapse 3) is in beta. There is no stable alternative.-Beta software means when there is an update to fix one problem new problems arise.-The software likes to lock up your mouse cursor especially when switching profiles fail to switch profiles alltogether and change or create brand new settings on you at random. No reliability to be found here.-When you inevitably run into problems customer support is no help. They ask you to re-install software and then offer to replace it. If you buy this mouse keep your old one as a backup. You will 100% need it because they don't ship you a new one until they receive your old one.-Collecting logs and trying to troubleshoot yourself is of no use. Even when you have a specific error code and description of the error google turns up no results and customer support doesn't know what you're talking about.
1,After having a Razer Naga Epic which lasted me for 6.5 years I was loyal to the Razer brand. I replaced it with a Naga Chroma when it wore out but that’s where the problems started. That Naga lasted me 1 year and I warrantied it out. That was a grueling process because of Razer’s customer service. When I finally got it replaced my replacement lasted about 2 years before the mouse wheel went out. I tried to replace it with the new Naga Trinity model but ended up a bust. I had to return and exchange this item 3 times at my local Best Buy within a week. The 5 key went out the next day on the first one the 3 key was sticking out of box on the second one and stopped working 2 days later. The 2 key on the third one didn’t work out of box. I will not buy a Razer Mouse again. Finally all over the web you can find info on the side panels not working and the on board memory of profiles to be a problem if used.P.S. As part of Razer’s new drivers they use software similar to not coin mining to earn “rewards points”. This puts an intense load on your PC making the video card run at full blast all the time. Do not use this.
2,Double-clicking issue began about five months into use and three months later it's gotten to the point where I can hardly draw a line in MS Paint from one edge of the page to the other. This is in contrast to the Naga I had purchased  around 2017 which lasted me 5 years. Utterly disappointed.
2,I didn’t even have this mouse for a year before it started having sensor issues. My husbands is now doing the same thing and so is my brothers. 3 of the same Razer mouses doing the same thing within two-three months of each other. Even reinstalled the software thinking that was the issue. Talked to a few more people and come to find out this is a known problem. Not worth the money at all. Buy a Corsair Scimitar instead.
1,After having this mouse for only a few months I am getting the double clicking issue that many people have mentioned on this product unfortunately I didn't read through the negative reviews before buying the product. The double clicking on left mouse click as well as on the side buttons make it impossible to game with currently. I had my original Razer Naga for about 7 years with no issues but unfortunately they discontinued that product. I have contacted Razer support and they refused to do anything about it so there is a solid chunk of cash I might as well have flushed down the toilet. I now know never to buy from Razer again despite their products being so high quality in the past.
2,I’m having the well covered issue of the mouse click failing. I tried to fix it myself since I’ve had the mouse for about 19 months and no longer any documentation. Big mistake to fix the mouse clock issues is not for a novice as it involves delicate parts.  This mouse lasted less than two years I do not recommend.
1,Look man. I love razer products. I love my headset. I adore my keyboard. But these mice... they just don’t make them like they used to. I had a Naga from 2013-2020. Finally gave out in October. I was bummed but it had seen several house moves and many years of gaming. I miss that thing. Bought a new one... fast forward two months. The thing cannot stop double clicking. Can’t click and drag a file let alone pan a camera in a game. Cool maybe it’s just an issue with this one mouse right? Wrong. Went through several replacements that all immediately developed the same problem. I miss when these were good. I’m saddened to say that I haven’t had a Naga that worked well in a long time.
1,Didn't last 5 months.  Double clicking and tracking issues.  Will not buy Razr again.
2,Feeling annoyed that I spent this much on a mouse that requires software that's listed as still being in Beta.  That's the sort of thing you should disclose to your prospective customers.  "Hey would you like to Beta Test our new mouse?"And unfortunately it works like it's in beta.  If I unplug the mouse for any reason then reconnect it the mousing functions will not work again unless I reboot my computer.  Oddly the side buttons still work.  It's just cursor movement scroll wheel plus right and left that no longer work until a reboot.  Loved my Naga Hex and Naga Chroma on Synapse 2.  This one with Beta Synapse 3 I'm leaning towards returning.
2,very disappointed with support about my mouse warranty i got ran around in circles after my mouse started messing up bad. hadn't even had it for 8 months. i don't know if i got a faulty one or what the deal was. I really liked it but sadly after my experience I wont be buying another razer mouse again.
1,I owned this mouse for almost a year. My first problem was when i got it the buttons were so easy to press i couldn't move the mouse side to side without clicking several buttons. As time went on the buttons got stiffer then the buttons began to get stuck and would take effort to actually press down. I attempted to clean it out thinking that was the problem but it wasn't the buttons just wore out that fast. The left mouse button started doing phantom clicks  last month and has been getting worse and worse. Now i cant hold the left mouse button down for more than a second before it will re-click again and again. The mouse is garbage don't waste your time even trying it. I was once a Razer Naga fan and this mouse has destroyed my impressions of the brand completely wont be trusting them anymore.
2,Its super comfortable but I only had the mouse for 8 months and left and right mouse went out. I understand a large amount of use can cause wear but it shouldn't be that fast for some bad ass mouse or so they portray it.
1,My gf got me this mouse for Christmas last year well the first one broke within 3 months and i got a replacement it is 5 months into the replacement and it has failed in the same way .The left and right buttons stopped working properly and click multiple times or not at all.  Support was quick and responsive with the first one but they have not even tried to help me with this one. been waiting weeks and no response.so takeaways its a cool mouse cool features but breaks from minimal use and customer service doesn't respond.Update: a few weeks ago customer service told me to fix it myself basically. but the problem persists even after all their solutions. so even tho i have a warrenty they refuse to replace it. gg i already replaced it and this lifetime user will now refuse to buy these products.
2,After only a couple of months I experience major tracking problems. Even when I'm not even touching the mouse the cursor would drag across the screen. And if it wasn't doing that every time you lift the mouse to re-center it on the pad the mouse cursor would jerk off to the side when you place it back on the mat which is really frustrating when playing a first person shooter. The only fix that I found was to re calibrate the mouse on the razer synapse but even this was temporary it would need to re calibrated once again after about an hour. wouldn't recommend this mouse for such a high price.
2,Won't hold and drag will randomly deselect my selections.  Same issues as everyone else I expected more from a $75 - $100 gaming mouse.  Quality sucks.  Look somewhere else if you want your mouse to last more than a year.
1,I am getting an infuriating double clicking problem I cannot copy paste half the time and in fast paced fps I am double shooting etc etc...Come to find that this is a common problem among Razer's mice I was kinda surprised since it has such a premium price. But it turns out that their premium mice are prone to this and many suffer from it not that long after buying it!I am not exactly happy with this gonna try and return for a new one if that one fails it's on to a new company with better less flawed mice.
1,Ignore your favorite streamers this product is trash.
1,Returning mine today. As there is no way to reset the Bluetooth pairing. The mouse blue tooth is stuck to a faulty pairing when attempting reset it found out there is no hardware reset button you can only reset using razer synapse software via USB. Which doesn't reset the Blu tooth pairing.  Why would any one not have a reset on the mouse?  Second whats with the ring finger reset?  Ergonomically that rolls the hands into an uncomfortable angle.  Instead of every recommendation to guilt or the other way to have comfort.  Bad just bad
1,I’ve exclusively used and loved the Razer Naga for decades. With this new design though I can no longer recommend this gaming mouse.  It’s a interesting concept to offer some added flexibility to the mouse. I understand what they were going for. Try and broaden it appeal across multiple type of gaming. However it fails at it’s original function now! AVOID! Try another brand if you have to or buy and older model. KEEP LOOKING!
2,FULL DISCLAIMER: I did not buy this mouse from Amazon.  That being said:The Naga Trinity is a wonderful mouse.  As great as any other Naga I've owned.  The issue with the mouse is the software.  This mouse *REQUIRES* Razer Synapse 3 a horribly broken program as of this writing.  The software has about a 50% chance of not even recognizing the Razer devices you have connected and half the time the software won't even launch.  It's much less user-friendly than Synapse 2.Wait for the program to exit beta stage if you're looking to buy this mouse.  Otherwise just try to find the standard Naga Chroma which will work with Synapse 2.
2,Left click-and-hold function faulty after one year of use. Problem persists across multiple computers and applications. Ruins gameplay. Other than that quality issue I love everything else about this mouse.
1,Do you enjoy having your aim constantly disrupted because your mouse inexplicably stops tracking on the X axis for short periods of time? Or stops tracking at all every time you lift off your mouse? Do you enjoy spending hours looking for solutions for these issues online being told to calibrate it or reset the mouse only to find that the issues suddenly reappear 20 minutes after fixing them? How about bloated software that requires you to register online and login to be able to use? Do you enjoy software bloated with a webstore and a bitcoin miner?If you've answered yes to any of these questions then Razer mice are for you!
2,Ive had this product for over a year and a half and it started double clicking with the left click. I've been baring with it for the past month but its only gotten worse. Almost unusable at this point. now I must buy another. and it will not be the Naga unfortunately.
1,had the 2012 razer naga for like 8 years.  great mouse loved everything about it.  it died recently (RIP).  decided to get the trinity.  hated it.  feels cheap too wide and side buttons spaced way too close together
2,Sometimes double clicks on its own. I noticed YouTube videos and articles detailing DIY fixes. One suggested the double click speed setting could be incorrect on the computer. No improvement after adjusting that. Other fixes require opening the mouse and replacing the switches or using a glob of glue to rebuild the worn parts. I haven't tried this yet and really expect better from such an expensive product.
1,I've had nothing but problems since buying this mouse.  The old Razer Naga mice were great but this one has had problems from day 1.  The magnetic swap-able side panel never sits right and often detects the incorrect panel connected.  Seems like they used cheaper switches as well as my right mouse button has been problematic from the start.  Avoid this mouse.
1,Have this at work with macro's assigned to the thumb buttons.  It's great when it works but it is usually more infuriating than helpful.  CONSTANT updates to the razer synapse software.  Which then breaks the macro's.  so then I need to reboot.  I have a Logitech G600 at home it just works and it is almost half the price right now.  Razer you used to make quality stuff.  I'll never buy a razer product again.
1,Razer has fallen pretty far. I tried to RMA this product after this well documented issue of the left and right mouse buttons not sticking started to occur making WOW impossible to play competently. They basically asked me to create a video showing them the behavior and if I didn't then I would receive no RMA support. That was on top of a slew of basic troubleshooting questions that would have no bearing on a physical hardware issue.Don't buy this product.
1,Bought this mouse ran into the double click issue that made it completely unusable for any sort of work or gaming. Figured I just got unlucky and got a defective mouse so I got another one - less than a week later had the same exact issue. Turns out a ton of other people are running into the clicking issue and there are numerous videos on youtube explaining how to "fix" it which involves opening up the mouse.Completely unacceptable for the price range. Worst part is that razer seems to have this issue across a number of their mice. Don't waste your time with this - just get another brand instead.
1,Really disappointed with how the quality of this mouse turned out to be really low. The first one I purchased had the exact same click issue this current one I am using has. Had this second one less than a year now.Had to use warranty information to get the second one and am looking to do the exact same thing to get the third one. I recommend doing this as the more money they lose due to this bad design the more notice the executives will take of their bad design/corner cutting decisions.
1,Mouse has a double click issue that affect my ability to use it for gaming. I test it out. Tried to use a can of compressed air as well and warranty is out.I will make sure none of the people i know ever buy a razor product ever again.
1,Im sitting here writing this review with my 3rd Razer Naga Trinity in the last 18 months. I have had to warranty out the other two. Just yesterday I started getting the double clicking issue again but this time it took 3 months to show up which is the fastest it ever has. I used to really respect razer as a brand and a company but now I cannot recommend them at all. They still make some good keyboards but stay away from their mice. They have serious QC issues that they refuse to acknowledge or do anything about.
1,When you hear gaming mouse you would think the item could withstand a little abuse. Not this mouse. I was using it and I dropped it from off my futon onto the ground which at the time was carpet. the mouse stopped working and sense has never worked again. I tried updating synapse drivers setting devices in device manager to not allow turn off taking out and re-inserting the USB uninstalling devices and reinserting the USB and nothing seems to work. total crap doesn't waste the time or money on this product. the product is cheap and i don't mean inexpensive. Low Quality and breaks way to easy to be considered gaming quality.
1,the left and right clicker are design very poorly and after a year I am not able to click and drag anymore the mouse keep double clicking.CS from Razer is very poor I left RMA an email and they never got back to me I called Razer and support was not available on the phone ... finally when i got Razer on live chat they asked me to send the mouse back to them for diagnostic even tough Razer already know about the mouse issues... so now i have to spend weeks without a mouse.
2,within a month the silicon or rubber plates have been worn away or come completely off despite not a lot of use. The Middle Mouse wheel is completely unusable because of the rubber or silicon track on the cheap plastic wheel has come unglued from the mouse wheel meaning you're trying to turn it and it's bunching up. I hate this mouse and looking to replace it despite buying it less than 2 months ago!
1,Be WARNED if you have been a loyal RAZER customer for 10 years and you have hundreds of MACROS on your old Naga Epic or other Razer products.YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TRANSFER THEM TO THE TRINITY NAGA!!  BE WARNED!! THE WORST BETRAYAL OF A GAMER YOU CAN DO IS TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING IS ON THE CLOUD AT SYNAPSE AND CAN BE LOADED TO YOUR NEW MOUSE. IT IS A LIE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY I LOST 400 MACROS OVER 8 YEARS ON 15 DIFFERENT TOONS ON 3 DIFFERENT GAMES. NO WAY TO REPLACE THEM UNLESS 1 AT A TIME.BE WARNED! THIS IS A JOKE.BE WARNED! BE WARNED! BE WARNED!
1,Absolutely a failure of a product and merely a shadow of what nagas used to be.Look at the reviews for this monstrosity of a mouse. The looks and feel of this mouse can't even begin to make up for the utter disaster that is its performance and durability. I bought mine in August 2019 and by September 2019 both the left and right click is super wonky.. 100 euros down the drain. Swapping to logitech g600 as I've heard amazing things about it.
1,It was a great mouse for about 40 days. It started with unresponsive side buttons and having to push a little harder and then the dreaded double left click began.I've owned plenty of razor nagas since 2009 and this one by far has been the worst. Their quality has gone down terribly over the years. My 2014 edition lasted less then 4-5 months before the double click began. This one made it less then 2 months and its already having the double left click issue and a right click releasing when you hold it in issue.Waste of $100. Stay clear and save your money
1,I’ve been using Razer Naga mouses since 2013. Last year my dog chewed the cable to my 2013 model Naga and I had to replace it. I’ve bought four of these newer models since all because of the clicking issue. The clicking on either the left or right WILL break after 2-4 months of use. I’ve decided to order a Logitech mouse instead of giving more money to Razer.DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO SPEND ON REPLACEMENTS OFTEN!!!!
1,The mouse is decent until the left and right clicks stop working properly. They'll double click when you don't want them to or they'll release randomly. And their support is miserable. Stinks that I lost out on the return because it happened after 2 months. DO. NOT. BUY.
1,Issues: Software (never works) Mouse Functionality (Double clicking and failure of certain buttons)Length of ownership: 5 monthsThis mouse has left a sour taste in my mouth for almost half a year. I used to love on Razer and be a fan boy but after this atrocity I will never buy one ever again. Go buy something else just please don't not this. I'm warning you.
1,Heavy and does not last. This is my second Naga Trinity. I like this version because the wheel of buttons is my favorite lay out and it doesn't return in other models. Razer Products are fine at first but they do not last. My left click double clicks does not drag and sometimes doesn't work at all. Major bummer. $200 dollars wasted for 2 mice that no longer work. Of course Razer says no longer covered. I'm done with them.
1,I've had my Naga for about 3 months now and it's already having major issues. Both the left and right mouse buttons randomly decide when they're going to work resulting in intermittent issues if you're trying to do anything by holding down either one of the mouse buttons. As I am using the mouse primarily for gaming having a mouse that randomly just stops working can present any number of annoying issues. Razer may have gotten my money on this pile of garbage but that's the last cent that they will ever get from me.
1,This mouse was AMAZING for the first few months I had it. It was exactly what I needed for World of Warcraft and I couldn't have been happier. After a few months though the left click button started stalling and double clicking. It was annoying but not too bad. Fast forward to now and it's basically unusable for WoW Overwatch or even Sims. Just save yourself the headache and buy a different mouse.
1,I first had the Naga and after less than 6 months it started the mis-click issue I love the way this mouse fits my hand so I went and got a new Naga Trinity and this time it only took 3 months for the Double/Mis-click Issue to start. I wont be dumb enough to buy a 3rd now I have to shop around and find one that's actually reliable.
1,This mouse feels great for about 30min. Then you start to experience this mouse's wiring being jiggled out during use so that you cannot use buttons or move the mouse. Then when switching to wireless the connection just drops at random intervals.
1,As many others have stated this product is plagued by double clicking and even the right mouse button does not hold the screen very well when gaming. It is double the price of similar products because of the name. I am in need of a new gaming mouse and will not be purchasing this item again.
1,This was my second Naga Trinity and was a replacement for my first which also began experiencing double click issue after about a year. I bought the second thinking perhaps it was a flook. Won't be buying again. Unacceptable.
2,I liked this mouse I wrote to Amazon saying I only received 1 of said 3 panels - nothing happened no response even. Thought to myself "Maybe I just didn't read the product correctly".6 months later and the mouse is double-clicking. I really do NOT recommend Razer mice in general.
1,I decided to give one of these a try after going through about 4 razer nagas over the course of three years. It felt good to use but after about thirty minutes of very light usage the side buttons stopped working and soon after the left click wasn’t working either. After reinstalling new drivers the same problem occurred. I would chalk this up as an anomalous faulty piece of hardware but given how dysfunctional razer mice can be I highly doubt this is the case.
1,Sad to say my mouse also has the dreaded double click/miss click issue. Seriously how does a company make a mouse that has a problem doing the first thing it was designed for..... Clicking. This issue happens in fps MMO and even work situations. Easily one of the least ergonomic mouses for larger hands.
1,Worked great also loved the ability to change out the thumb button. After about 4 months though both the right and left mouse buttons are failing. Pressing down now it often doesn't "click" or it double clicks. Quickly became virtually unusable for gaming.
1,I loved my old gaming mouse and really wanted to give this one a try. I play a lot of different games and was excited about the idea of being able to switch the plates in and out (which is still cool). But then the issues with the mouse started. The mouse wheel became so difficult to scroll with that you end up clicking the middle mouse button with how hard you have to push it. In games this triggers random events and on websites it ends up opening windows or interrupting the scrolling. It is such a pain that at this point I have to return it.
1,I have been a razer fan for quite some time but that is changing quickly. This mouse always breaks somewhere after about 6 months of play. The price is NOT worth the horrible quality. Before you buy google this mouse's problems!
1,Good mouse but the forced program for Synapse needs some work for the longest time it did not detect my mouse on synapse so I couldn't use many of the buttons.  Razer support is extremely useless telling me to do the same steps over and over again to try their "fixes" when i would tell them I've done these steps several times.  Horrible customer support had to end up figuring it out myself as it was a software issue and I spent over 12 hours on my day off trying to figure out what it was.
1,this mouse was actually pretty reasonable; until it started wanting to click everything 1k times.  if you look up the razer double clicking problem youll know exactly what i mean.  apparently this is a common problem throughout their mouse line.
1,Its such a great product but theres so many things that made me rate this a 1 star.I bought this mouse a couple months ago and its already showing some issues.The mouse keeps freezing it keeps skipping and theres literally now way to fix this.I've tried to update drivers update the razer synapse program calibrate the mouse through the program. EVERYTHING.I've unplugged it from the usb port and into another one this mouse has gotten so bad that i can't even play any games.
1,I've warrantied this mouse 3 times now each time I am without a mouse until I get back the next unit. I've had to buy a back up mouse just to make due in between this thing getting sent to Razer and then sending me a new one. A processes that takes 2 weeks minimum sure each time I get a new one but it makes you think why are so many of these mice defective? How long is it going to last after my warranty is finally up? I've never had this much trouble with any of my hardware for my computer before.
1,Second mouse I buy that has the same double clicking issue... The best part? It was bought less than a year ago and there is already no warranty... Never again... GARBAGE!
1,Purchased on August 29th 2020 and on November 11th 2020 it started the dreaded double clicking again. From previous experience with Razer support the turn around time for an RMA should be roughly a month.
1,I had this mouse for a few months before I started having problems with the scroll wheel sometimes when I would click it wouldn’t register and when I scrolled it would click.
1,I have bought 2 of these now in the past year they are a terrible mouse they do not hold up to the use that is needed by gamers. The last one I bought was just a few months ago and now it is not working. Save yourself the money Buy a Logitech G600 My husband has on and it has lasted for years.
1,I have a razer tartus and a razer keyboard... love them. However... this piece of trash worked great for about 3 weeks then it just started blowing out my USB ports without warning. Ive reset them over and over... and this WILL NOT WORK.Most expensive paperweight you can buy for a computer.
1,Double clicking can't use the hot keys in multiple games
1,just like other reviews you will read my mouse was working fine for the first month or so then out of no where the numbers 1 - 3 where no longer responding consistently. Needless to say its unacceptable when you are trying to play games competitively. As a whole i would not recommend this product for any gamer.
1,Do not buy this mouse. The tracking on it is absolutely awful. You can google it for yourself it's an issue with this mouse. Better yet don't buy their products in general. Overpriced trash. You're wayyy better off buying corsair if you want to spend money or logitech. Logitech is half the price of this junk and still more reliable.
1,Not recommended. Great for gaming but it wont last.
1,I didn't have it over night and decided to bring it back.  There is something wrong with the twelve side buttons.
1,I had 3 naga before switching to this mouse and will be returning it after a month and never buying razor again. The mouse 1 button doesn’t hold when trying to drag and drop anything. And the mouse wheel is intermittently unresponsive in one direction. Sometimes delayed even. These mice are gimmicky and overpriced. I’ve also been through my share of Logitech and steelseries mice.
1,Started double clicking less than a year in waste of money get a Corsair or Logitech.
1,Double clicking by software went thru 3 mouse and I am done with this company moving one u should too.
1,cuts out all the time dont buy this product
1,I have bought like 5 naga all end up the same not working double click wont buy it anymore
1,Right click button failed after just 2 months.
1,Classic. My mouse has developed the classic double click issue where one click results in two often impeding my workflow because of erroneous clicks. Don't buy Razer products.
1,Don't buy this mouse only lasted 2 months worst birthday gift ever
1,I have had two of these.  Both broken within less than a two year period.  Same problem each time.  The side buttons would stop working.
1,Razer Naga Epic Chroma riddled with tracking issues no lift off detection settings no way to fix the jumpy and jittery non-precise nature of this mouse. Terrible sensor. Buttons are great though best feeling mouse I've owned besides the fact that in practice it's not so good. I've owned several Naga's and they've all had tracking issues.
1,The device was causing weird and sporadic phantom keyboard input making games unplayable.
4,Razer software is amazing. This allows me to switch between fps and mmo comfortably. Easy to setup buttons on.Before buying this i bought a 50$ mmo mouse on amazon with similar specs. But the buttons were uncomfortable to press on that one the buttons were mushy and the software was awful.This doesn't charge by USB-C which is ridiculous at a 150$ price tagAlso it's hard to find a micro-USB cable you can use as a replacement for the one that comes with the mouse.When connected to 2.4ghz adapter it gets laggy sometimes so you have to take out the adapter and reconnect it even if the adapter is plugged into your keyboard. I ended up using bluetooth adapter i bought on amazon
5,It had been many years since I purchased a Razer mouse. The last iteration of the Razer Naga I had owned was an older model I bought in 2012 that is no longer manufactured. It came as described. It is light in hand not too noisy though a bit smaller than what I am used to/previous Naga models.Only issue I've encountered with it is that the thumb keypad can be a bit sensitive depending on how you grip the mouse but this might just be a personal issue.
5,Two big unique features: the ring finger "shelf" and swappable plates.I've always been a big fan of the ring finger shelf just gives more comfortable mouse control.I did not expect to swap the plates out as often as I do. Any moment just pop it off and switch it in. They're magnetic so no fuss but they don't fall off randomly. Two buttons for work (copy/paste) and shooters 16 buttons for mmos. So excellent and convenient.Then all the usual gaming mouse stuff excellent software RGB tweaking all what you'd expect.
5,The matte texture of the naga feels a lot better than the glossy old models that gather fingerprints.The side-swap button feature is very nice too as I can customize based on what game I am playing.Been using many iterations of the Razer naga due to the need for mouse side-buttons and this is so far my favorite.Note the mouse is slightly on the bigger side of Razer mice so it's more suitable for a palm grip.
2,I had to change my review since it's inconceivable that this issue (reported since 2018) is still happening. It damaged my trust in the brand. I have already sent an email to: amazon.support@razer.com but it's almost a week since that and I don't know if they are going to respond to my warranty. Really sad experience after being so excited to finally have a high end mouse for the first time.
5,I have owned the Razer Naga original multiple times and have always liked them. I recently decided to pick up this version of the Naga (Trinity) this time around. It is a bad ass mouse with so many different customizations including 3 different buttons plates that are easily swapped in a split second without any effort. This is probably the number 1 gaming mouse available for a great price. Razer nails it with the overall quality of the item and features! Must have if you are a gamer especially for MMO/MMORPG gamers like myself.
5,I have used razer mice for years the software has always been a little buggy and annoying. Now that I have this one with onboard memory I can turn off the razer synapse software and still use my programmed buttons.
5,i orginally bought this to replace my 2014 razor naga epic and this mouse is fast responsive so much it took me a few days to get use to playing games with it. If your into shooters this is a great mouse.
5,It's like having 3 mice in one why would you NOT want to do that? Also the software with Razer makes it extremely easy to set up different profiles for work/school/gaming. They also update it frequently which some other brands don't get.
5,this is my second naga i have not used the other set ups just the 12 button one wich i  like wean add with the macro set ups
1,Uncomfortable and feels cheap and flimsy not a fan of it i got the corsair instead and WAY BETTER
5,Panels are easy to change out and macros work like a dream.
4,Theirs not a lot of 18 button mouses and this is by far the best one. All of the buttons have a very tactile clicky experience everything is within reach you don't have to struggle to hit certain button
5,I ordered this mouse because the other Razer products seems to be light and too small for my hands. This mouse has some heft lots of side buttons and a great feel!
5,Was a good gift! The modular control is very cool.
5,PERFECT AND VERY NICE
5,The plastic doesn't feel like the highest quality at first but it's working great it fits comfortably in my hand and it's very responsive. I would definitely buy this again if I ever need another mouse.
5,Siempre me ah gustado razee son muy cómodos para jugar y buen servicio
5,fully customizable
5,Always wanted one of these. Perfect for any kind of game since it is interchangable.
5,My son loves this mouse. Very high speed
5,Great mouse. Everything works and works well. Love the magnetic interchangeable sides.
5,My son loves this for gaming
5,So we bought this for my stepson for gaming and he absolutely loves it. He enjoys the sleekness as well as the lengthy battery life.
3,i didn’t like how it doesn’t have a forward and backward button on the side of the mouse but it’s a good gaming for the price i got
5,Comfortable for long periods of time and highly customisable to your exact desires. Lights speeds buttons everything.
5,Love this mouse for everything on my pc quick change for side buttons is amazing
5,I bought it for my husband. He likes it very much
5,I don't like the grip of the mouse particularly but I will adjust quickly to it my biggest problem is with the range if you are 8 ft away the mouse will studder and lose connection I could see 10-12 feet being to much that's acceptable to me but I have to keep this thing about 6.5 feet away from the mouse or closer to work I feel like razer sacrificed range for this stupid dongle deal they could of integrated it better and made it longer or a swing out tiny antenna something for the price that's just unacceptable
5,This is the 3rd Naga mouse I have used and I always get this model. Each one lasts me about 3+ years before I have to replace it. The first mouse had the optic fail and the 2nd mouse lost it's response in the right click. These failures were after thousands and thousands of hours of use.  I game and work on the same setup so this mouse sees a ton of use on a daily basis. The side mouse buttons are amazing for both gaming and adding shortcuts for my editing programs and even simple online browsing. 10/10 will always recommend.
5,For gaming I didn’t really like it because I think it’s a little discomfort with palm placement.  I guess takes a bit of getting used too!  I’m okay with this purchase!
5,The mouse is everything you'd want in a mouse. Wireless good battery life colorful (works with Razer Synapse) responsive detachable sides to fit your style ergonomical. I can't see a reason to buy another mouse unless you want something slimmer and lightweight. For games like FPS or Moba like LoL I'd recommend the viper. If you want a daily driver RPG games and the like I'd recommend this. Of course if you wanted to you could use this mouse for all purposes.
5,I purchased a molten naga back in 2012 and loved it...... until it double clicked on the left mouse button. This has newer more durable switches also wireless and hot swappable side buttons via magnetism. I hope this thing lasts me awhile the molten took a year of moderate gaming to have a clicking issue.
5,This is the best mouse I've ever used.  I've been using the naga since Wow vanilla.  The number pad is an essential part of my gameplay.The RGB is pretty cool and the synapse works as great as it always has.Amazon really has to do something about all these fake reviews.
5,I've had zero issues with the mouse.  I really liked the circular button configuration of the previous version. Is there a circular side plate for this one?  I find 12 buttons a bit much and 6 not enough.  I need 7 to 8.  But I love the weight and feel of the Trinity and the ability to change the button configurations.  Just want the buttons of the hexagon.
5,Bought as a gift. Gift recipient like it a lot - how it feels in the hand and how it functions. I've used it a few times and it's definately a nicer design and feel than my normal non-gaming mouse. However this I'm not very experience with gaming mice.He's only used it for a couple months so can't really speak to the dreaded buttons issues it seems like all gaming mice eventually get.
4,Was using Corsairs 12 button mouse for years still works but felt like the buttons were getting super touchy so I decided to switch back to Razer. Good quality mouse but I did have an issue one day where the 2 key was not working unplugged it and plugged it back in and it started working again and has been fine ever since but I am a little concerned it will happen again.
5,I have been using Razer products for quite a few years. I really appreciate the quality of thief products. I have had this mouse for a few years and it is still going strong.
5,This is my all time favorite mouse. I’ve tried 7 other mice and couldn’t find THE one. This is it right here. I love the ergonomics. It took some getting used to but now I can never go back to a normal mouse. The side stays on all the time while playing and comes off super easily. You could switch button styles in under 5 seconds. This is a great mouse and I will keep buying them until they come out with the Naga 2
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             If you are unaware of Razer and company itself they have been making content for games for over a decade now. Every keyboard mouse headset camera even mouse pads come with compatible software.  Free software with no installation hassle. You will be receiving an exclusive rare sticker and the free software for the product when plugged in USB.For Gaming: 100% Gamer recommended. If this was a toothbrush 5 out of 6 Gamers would recommend using this. I only say that because the size of this actual product is relatively small and not meant for large hands in my opinion.The attachments:Their magnetic they fit perfectly and make a sweet noise when attached. Each attachment is built for different types of games or handling of controls.  You're looking at a two button side for your First Person Shooters A 6 button slot for RPGs and thirdly a 12 button attachment for you're MOBA/MMO games.  Personally my favorite attachment is the 6 button slot. The end of your thumb fits on a textured matte which gives you a better grip on the side of the mouse and easier access to buttons. Also it feels really cool.Applications (Games):MOBA/MMO/FPS/RTS/Action/Horror/Indie literally any genre of gaming is enhanced with this mouse. Changing the keybindings to the number pads on your side virtually makes every game you play modded to your liking. For a more enhanced better edge and quicker "draw" on the field of battle is accessible with this mouse. Switching these panels doesn't reset you're keybindings. (Referring to 6 slot to 12 slot buttons) Quick access to these buttons allow for easier game for you vs standing over a keyboard button mashing.  Overall this gives you a quicker reaction time between switching "gear" in a game. (Main weapon secondary weapon.)a DPI switch  on the very top placement of the mouse grants quick switching in your overall sensitivity. This can be switched at any moment that the mouse is plugged in. Either in game on desktop or just getting used to new DPI's. (Great for switching roles in your FPS/RPG's.)Ergonomically:the mouse is slightly small to medium-small build. If you're someone with larger hands or fingers stop reading now and find another mouse. This product is not for you. The Naga Trinity mouse comes with a ring finger rest giving the both index and main finger for nice placement. Comfortable Medium light weight and fits your hand. This is also a ride handed mouse and not for left handed users. using this mouse for weeks now I've not noticed any strain or uncomfortable pain for placement. I believe this mouse was built in mind for the user's hand first and features second.The Material Quality: The key words I would use for the material are these: Soft smooth and durable. Dropping the mouse on the floor will not crack or scratch the product at first. I've luckily dropped mine twice so far and it's still pristine in shape. I'm not sure what the material actually is but it's comfortable to the touch. The Chroma RGB feature is exceptional vs these other releases from other companies. (Red Dragon War Falcon Hyper X). The cord is braided as well and that has its perks as well. (Less wire shorts less tangles more quality vs ugly plastic.)Software: Installation is immediate and relatively quick depending on the Personal Computer. You will want to spend a solid hour if you really want to get familiar with Razer and their ability to use Chroma on your mouse. Chroma is a visualizer; you're using that in *all* Razer products. Ultimately you're getting an application with any and all hardware and you can have beautiful orchestrated cascading effects on your mouse keyboard and mouse pad. Also the company keeps the software updated routinely. (That are all Razer I'm unsure with third party hardware such as Steel Series or other popular brands.) 5/5
5,I can not game without a MMO mouse but I hate the cord getting caught on stuff so I decided to get the wireless mouse. It works great out the box.Only tip I'd suggest is to get the wireless charging stand (does not have to be the 50$ one from razer there are cheaper alternatives that work) It makes charging easier just dock it for the night and you won't have to worry about your charge but also it should be able to also take your wireless dongle which is important  because my PC is under my desk so the interference was making my mouse not respond for half a second every once in a while. Getting the charger that sits on my desk with the dongle in it cleared up that issue.I've had the product for 2 weeks at the time of this review and have not experienced double clicking issues. I have the Naga trinity before and my clicking did start double clicking after like 5 years of reliable use. I will update if I feel like I got some premature double clicking failure going on.
5,As a world of Warcarft player I love this mouse. The buttons are right where I need them and have gotten used to the button lay out pretty quick. Would recommend to anyone.
5,Works perfectly
4,I had to dissemble the mouse in order to resolve a loose left and right mouse button.  Once that was resolved the mouse started performing well.  Because I had to apply a fairly complex fix and I had to buy replacement mouse feet as a result of the fix I applied I'm docking a couple stars.
5,The mouse I got is wired. The mouse takes some getting used to but is overall really nice. I've had the month for a couple months and have no real issues with it. The changeable plates were a huge mind-blowing thing to me and honestly still are. The mouse is a really nice mouse. All buttons on all panels and the mouse can all be bound to separate things. All bindings can be bound to game profiles and whatnot as well. I recommend this mouse.
5,This was exactly what i needed. My last mouse died after 4 years so i went looking and found this. Absolutly thrilled with it. another home run from Razer!
5,100% legit mouse and perfect condition arrived faster than expected 10 out of 10 I’d recommend anyone to buy.
5,Can take some getting used to the size and feel of the mouse especially with the 12 button panel attached but it works great for MMO gameplay or any other games that have a large amount of hotkeys used in gameplay.
5,I've tried several mice for MMORPGSs (Runescape 3 PvM). I was originally using the Logitech G600 but I noticed some hand pain after use for several hours as it was too heavy. I then tried the Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite - but noticed the surface of the mouse (whatever material they used) was prone to getting sticky and oily after just a bit of use. The UI/UX of the macro software was also terrible.This Razer Naga X fits the bill and I'm very happy with it. It is:1. Light and ergonomic for those with smaller hands. No pain after prolonged use2. Razer Synapse's macro recording and user interface is amazing. Super easy to use3. The surface of the mouse feels very comfortable it's ever so slightly grainy with some friction but doesn't stick to your fingersOverall 10/10. I moved away from Razer back in 2016 because I had issues with their deathadder build quality but I'm impressed they have continued to innovate 5 years later!
5,ok
5,excelent quality
5,The only thing is wonderful thing is missing is a Type C chord but I suppose it's not that new anyway. So many ways to connect the 2.4 wireless dongle bluetooth and direct connection. RGB works on all three you just have to re-click your magnetic plate for some reason! I was about to call support because I thought RGB only worked on the wired connection. Nope! Click magnet boom boom lights. All my plates work great so far clicking perfectly. I can't wait to play some games
5,Not sure what higher praise I can give for a heavily used gaming mouse.
5,Took a couple of days to get used to the ergonomic build of the mouse but after that it was a wrap. This mouse is so comfortable and with the other side button attachments which I find a blast to have I just have no words to explain how good this mouse is for me anyways. I can set macros to whatever button I want allowing me to use all the numbers on it. Only con I can say about it is it’s a bit heavy lmfao but I like my mouses to have a bit of weight on them though so I’m not complaining 😂
1,FOR WIFEBEATERS BY WIFEBEATERS @Razer! Your company has vocally and actively supported Infiltration despite what he CHOSE TO DO TO HIS WIFE! You have DEFENDED HIM OVER AND OVER! I have bought Razer products since the very first Boomslang which I still have. No more!
5,So after all the mice I've been through I wanted one with buttons on the side for gaming. However the 12 button ones intimidated me. I felt like 12 buttons would be easy enough to program but hard to remember what they did especially when playing multiple different characters with different abilities/spells. I also have had issues in the past with the clicking problem described in a lot of reviews. I was hesitant to get this mouse because of these reasons. One reason I was drawn to this mouse is the 7 buttons option. And then if I got comfortable with the 7 buttons maybe I could 'graduate' to the 12 buttons! But having the intermediate option was appealing.All that being said the mouse works perfectly. I like the synapse 3 program for keymapping and macros. I like the shape weight and design of the mouse. I like that it's wired so I don't have to worry about charging or batteries. The color options are nice as an added bonus.I have used it for a solid month now and have had zero issues. I enjoy the texture of the clicks the nice slide of the mouse and all the settings. I've grown comfortable with the side buttons and being able to to press the button I intend to use. I may or may not try the 12 button panel but I really enjoy having that option without having to purchase a whole other mouse.
5,I was nervous buying this seeing the reviews showing a REQUIRED profile for the software. I tried an alternative mouse but it just wasn't as good so decided to see if the software was that bad.... Guys.... You don't need to register a profile just click guest and you can set up the mouse locally the profile is to transfer settings. If you don't care about that just use guest.
3,[November 20 2020] Over 1 year update:Mouse scroll wheel stopped working today.. At first just became VERY difficult to scroll but then became completely incapable of scrolling at all. Looked online to see if there was a way to fix it (other people have had this issue as well) and there was a video tutorial of how to fix it but it involved grease and seemed a bigger hassle than it's worth. Overall it was a fine mouse. Looking into the Logitech 604 Lightspeed my husband uses it and it seems better button placement wise (though I did enjoy the circle and having the other options for this one). Some people think it's realistic to have to get a new mouse every year but I think you should at least get a couple years out of them... Ah well![September 22019] Original Review:The only thing that sucks: I have sorta small hands short fingers and the way the mouse is designed is that pressing it at the tips of the clickers requires a lot less strength than when you press it closer to the end of the clicker that is closer to the middle of the mouse. If that makes sense. This doesn't matter that much except for gaming it gets tiresome pressing over and over again (especially wow when you're holding down the clicker to move etc). The way I get around this is by using their right-click-to-move function and letting my character mostly auto-run. I also have pretty bad hands (arthritis/fibromyalgia) so this might not affect other people with more strength in their hands. And if you have medium/larger hands you don't have to worry about this at all.Now that that is out of the way I love love love this mouse. It is so lightweight and easy to move. The shape of it is perfect for my palm/grip. The three different attachments you can switch in and out is SO nice. I ended up using the circle one (pictured) for gaming and it was actually one that I hadn't thought I would use until I really got my hands on it. I love the area in the center of the circle where you can grip your thumb and really control the mouse movement with precision and without accidentally pressing buttons.  The color features are everything I could have wanted. You can adjust the speed of the cursor super simply and custom to what you need. The length of the wire is perfect even if you bit further from the desk than normal and it is a really nice heavy-duty cloth wire.
4,Best mouse I’ve used just wish the battery life was better
5,I am a right arm amputee and I game quite a bit. I got this mouse so I could program some keyboard switches to the mouse and wow how simple razor makes it with the chroma app. I have only set up the top 6 switches and they work quite well so far! Did just what I wanted it to!
5,Had the 2014 razer naga before this wired with only the 12 button side no interchangeable plates.Incredibly fast and responsive in all three modes(bt dongle and wired) great feel in the hand Easy to function and change modes and plates.The new(er) software makes changing key configurations incredibly easy.Perfect product.
5,good for skills buttons
5,I love razer products very well made and this one no deference it does exactly what I want to do and what I expected very high quality.
5,I am an almost 10-year Razer Naga user from the original Razer Naga to the Epic Chroma to Trinity and finally Naga Pro.I get used to the layout when it first came out it has such a unique design which is optimized for MMO players. I can not get back to anything else after being extreme user of its side buttons.The Pro is easily the best Naga ever it fixed the reliability issue for Trinity greatly improved battery life from the old Epic Chroma while keeping the same button layout and ergonomic design.It does not have the charging dock in the box which I think should have been included. In order to charge without the dock you need to plug the USB cable to the mouse. It uses a proprietary usb cable (on the mouse side) and is not compatible with generic USB micro-B cables.Pros:* Classic Razer Naga design very comfortable with 12 customizable side keys and replaceable side panels.* Very long battery life (when lights are off). I can easily use it for over 2 weeks (with average 8 hours of use per day) without charging. It is a quite significant leap from the original Epic Chroma which only last for 3-4 days of use.* Reliable optical switches eliminates possibility of double clicks.* With onboard memory. Once you have configured the mouse it can save the settings to its onboard memory and you can uninstall the Razer driver.Cons:* Does not include the charging dock* Uses proprietary use cableI have originally scored 3 stars for the Razer Naga Trinity.  The Naga trinity is the first approach for Razer to build a mouse with a replaceable side panel. There are multiple issues exists for the durability and reliability of this mouse:* The switches are bad and easily double click after some time of usage* The side panel is held by magnets which has possibility of bad connections. During my usage over a few months the side panel have lost responsiveness several times.All of these issues are fixed in the Pro version which have better switches (with optical switch for the main buttons).
5,Note: The hyper shift feature is accomplished via synapse configuration.Hyper shift: 2 buttons become 4  7 becomes 14 and 12 becomes 24.The plates detach easily and remain intact firmly via magnets.my favorite for general computer use is the 7 buttons circular pad.
4,I really wanted to like this mouse but my ring finger get uncomfortable in a few minutes on the ring finger rest. Besides that the clicks were very good the weight was very light and the extra buttons were good.I ended up returning it and getting a Corsair RGB Dark Core Pro and I find this ring/pinky rest to be so much more comfortable.
5,I use my mouse for work and for gaming so I log a lot of hours. My previous mouse I had for about 7 years - nothing fancy.Time to make an upgrade. I wanted something that is versatile enough to manage my work and gaming needs and furthermore span all of my gaming needs (FPS MMO etc.). This mouse covers all those needs and more. The face plate for me is a game changer. The buttons feel tight and responsive the like the rubberized feel of the mouse wheel and the feel of the different thumb buttons. The software is easy to use and facilitates many different customization options. Huge upgrade for me. I highly recommend this mouse.There are two things that I wish were different: just my preference. 1) I wish the mouse was a little longer. the height is great and it glides on my mouse pad without any issue. I have a larger hand and this mouse is a little small (it's the normal size compared to all other mouses I have compared it to). Again personal preference.2) I would like a case supplied for the 2 faceplates you don't use. The packaging is nice. The mouse (with faceplate installed) and the 2 other faceplates are in a plastic container. I cut that container in half and essentially created my own "case" for the faceplates. It would be awesome if RAZER did that for me (like perforating a line down the middle or something). Again just personal preference.
5,I love this mouse works well for games and like the colors.Razer you have to switch the mouse on and off on 2.4 to get buttons to come up or open the Razer app sometimes restart it for buttons.But it works well and I like it. It recharges on the station or with the cord very accurate and nice to have. I use the number side for login pin lower 3 for volume up mute and volume down.
4,It's an amazing mouse! Love the three panels but the cursor WILL jump across the screen/lag if you don't use a mousepad with it.
4,My 2012 version of the naga died recently may it rest in peace. It lasted a very long time and I definitely got my money's worth out of it and then some. I debated spending the extra money on the pro wireless and to be honest I never use it wirelessly. The battery life is awful.However it's comfortable everything is familiar to my old mouse the number pad on the side of the mouse is bigger and feels better. I haven't used the other attachments yet probably won't ever use them.
5,Bought this mouse brand new $20 all because the box had a small rip this mouse is amazing for World of Warcraft. I use this mouse for so much and it’s been handy with the keypad on the side. I also had zero issues with the Razer software. 10/10
5,Razer as always never leaving gamers disappointed a pc must
5,This is my third one the others gave me years of daily hard use until bits wore out. Liked it enough to buy another.
5,I always have heard Razer is good but to experience their products for the first time is incredible.  First of all the optical switches are not just a gimmick.  They're incredible.  There's a certain point of clicky pressure then it's the easiest thing to press and the reaction time is instant/at the speed of light.  The varied options on Synapse 3 are incredible but I hated the fact that I could not use a rapid fire button or Windows shortcut with the onboard memory.  I let Razer know and a week later it was fixed.  Whether that's coincidence or amazing customer service I don't know but incredible.  The lighting is the only other thing I would like.  I would like onboard lighting.  The same issue as with their keyboards.  You get the same lame spectral cycling effect all day if you're on a work computer/not using Synapse.  I wish you could add per key lighting as well like you can on their keyboards just to really round off some effects.  Otherwise really impressed with this product especially now that macros are available onboard.
5,El mouse de por sí es bueno puedes cambiarle las cosas pero creo que es por un tema de costumbre que no me llegó adaptar a los botones hahaha así que lo deje con los típicos adelantar y retroceder pero todos los fines de semana trato de adaptarme a las mecánicas de varios botones ya que estáas destinado para rpgs
5,The naga series is the best multipurpose mouse on the market! I use it for all sorts of stuff from playing World of Warcraft to photo editing. You can bind anything pretty much to the keys and the ability to switch this new version on up to 4 different bluetooth capable devices is awesome!!!!! If you like gaming or just doing everything from just the mouse this is the mouse for you!!
5,great mouse that can easily be used for gaming!
5,I'll never go back to any kind of mouse again there is no upgrading unless they make a faster one with even more side plates but other than that i dont think their is anyway they could improve on this mouse!!!
5,Hoping this mouse last a long time because I LOVE IT usually I like a bit of weight to my mice but this one fits so perfectly in my hands and makes playing WoW so much easier
5,Before this mouse I used two Logitech G600 for a few years. One in the office and one at home. I wasn't a PC gamer back then but I used the mouse for graphic design work. It was really convenient having all my most used macros programmed on the thumb buttons. It was a great time saver! I used those G600s until last year when the left button on both began double clicking. The problem actually started much earlier and progressed until both mice were completely unusable. I bought a G305 to hold me over. I used the G305 for a few months but I was really missing all those buttons on an MMO mouse. I initially wanted the Naga Pro because it is wireless but I kept reading comments from people having issues with the contacts of the detachable thumb button plates. I typically use my mouse for a few years and I don't really want to have to deal with intermittent issues with the side buttons. I ultimately went with the Naga X. With a properly managed cable it's easy to forget that I'm using a wired mouse. One of the main selling point of this mouse for me is the optical switches. I'm hoping that this will not have the double clicking issues that my G600s have. It's so refreshing having all those buttons available to map in games. I also use all the side buttons outside of gaming. I have the buttons program to things such as volume control back/forward on browsers and copy/paste. It's really convenient. For a newcomer having 12 buttons on the thumb might seem overwhelming at first but with some practice muscle memory takes over. It's very easy to differentiate the buttons from each other because they are all shaped differently. After a while you start to memorize the distinct feel of each button. For someone learning an MMO mouse I still think that the G600's button shapes are easier to learn. the G600 divides the 12 buttons into two groups of 6 buttons. With that configuration it's quite easy to learn where each individual buttons are. Of course this  is also how I treated the Naga X when I got it. The grouping of the buttons is not as obvious as the G600's but dividing the buttons into two groups of six really makes it more manageable in use. It takes a bit to learn but each row and each button on the Naga X have a very distinct feel from each other. In use my thumb is usually resting in the gap between buttons 2 and 5. That way any of the buttons from 1 to 6 is quick and easy to reach. I then map less critical actions on the second group of buttons 7 to 12.I've also read many negative comments regarding the Razer Synapse software. This is the first time I've used the software and so far it's really been good in my experience. Profile switches reliably between desktop and gaming. The Logitech gaming software has a bad habit of not switching from time to time especially when alt-tabbing in and out of a game. The only issues I've seen in Synapse is related to the graphical interface when sometimes it doesn't seem to update properly. I'm not sure if this is related to Windows 11 but hopefully they update it soon. This doesn't affect the usability of the mouse though.If you're at all interested in an MMO mouse the Naga X seems to be a really good option right now. It's quite light it's comfortable and it has optical switches for durability.
5,Software works great I have multiple setups for each attachment. It also works with my Tartarus V2 game pad I barely ever use my keyboard when gaming but mostly just using extra buttons to give me more keyboard combinations with my Tartarus V2.
5,Love the side buttons and the razor app. Let's me add a macro for any button I want. Usually use left or right click with 12 and 11. Also use 10 for enter on gta. Works great would recommend
5,Item as expected
5,I started on an old school Naga then went to Logitec and then back to the Naga. This mouse is very nice but you need to play with the sensitivity if that is an issue for you.
5,While they aren’t the most popular brand it works really well for any game from shooters to mobas as far as I’ve seen the interchangeable sides are great and easy to swap out based on my game needs the mouse is comfortable for the average size hand and the color customization is awesome.
5,Absolutely love the Naga. I have had some version of it for WoW since the original V1 was released and this is the best one yet. Great skates buttons feel fantastic incredibly responsive feels great in hand. The only down side is the battery with the lights on it really can only last one day of hard playing before needing charging. The upside is that it charges very quickly and the cord they give you is very nice though I would have preferred type C. Overall great wireless mouse and would highly recommend if you play MMOs.
5,Love it thank you . It works really good with my computer
5,One of my favorite gaming mice and the changeable thumb plates are awesome!
5,Was a gift for my son.  He is thrilled with this!
5,nice
5,Definatley the best quality gaming mouse I've ever owned! Easy instillation super customizable thanks to razer software and performs very well.
5,In love with this mouse
5,Things are great
1,Self-explanatory. The Razer Naga series has a horrible reputation for double-clicking and bad connections when holding down buttons. My first one broke after barely a year.  I returned it for warranty after 2 weeks of back and forth emails and my replacement took them literally two months to ship. The "brand-new" replacement had the same issue in two months. The last I will ever be buying from Razer.
5,this is the best mouse I've ever held  i've used death adder for about 8 years and naga hex for few monthsand this naga trinity was the best feeling and also the replaceable side are perfect for the different games i play
5,Compre desde antofagasta chile y me llego todo bien.lo recomiendo totalmente!
5,The pop off options is nice snap n go I’ve had no issues so far I bought a Corsair mouse didn’t like it. Missed my naga so I came back to the comfort and style. I’m happy I got this mouse
5,Love this mouse. It can match my razor keyboard. Very easy to use. You can change the DPI and the sides are easy to swtich out. The color is great. Would recommend.
5,I use it for WoW Classic.  I've moved my strafing and back pedaling to my mouse so that I can use my left hand for spell casting.  Works great.  I am agile with both spells and movement.
5,Very happy with my purchase.  Great mouse. Tons of customization options.
5,O mouse é o melhor na minha opinião para jogar o uso fazem 5 anos o unico problema que ele apresentou das duas vezes que o tive inclusive da ultima vez que o comprei por este link é que com o tempo as teclas laterais apresentam problemas de reconhecimento não sei se devido ao mal projeto... Só sei que se fixar bem o reconhecimento melhora mas durante os jogo isso pode trazer problemas as vezes. Mas definitivamente o melhor mouse gamer de todos
5,I had a razer Naga 4 years ago. This one doesn't have the razer logo illuminated but the price is right. The side buttons are firm and i don't have problems accidentally pressing them like I did on a Logitech G600. Great mouse
5,Un mause excelente para jugar al wow shooter. Cómodo y de muy buenos materiales.
5,Produto de muita qualidade bem embalado mouse incrível. vale cada centavo
5,I like it i love swapping to 2 buttons to play games and the 7 buttons to do work
5,Maravigoldetop.
5,Muy útil para los juegos
2,Hasta hace un mes todo bien el mouse es muy bonito tiene buenos efectos rgb.Ahora es el septimo mes  y ya sus clicks no funcionan bien tiempo de cambiarlo si o si.Además la app de synapse 3 es algo lenta y tiene algunos bugs. Definitivamente no es el mejor pruducto razer he tenido otros de la misma marca con muy buena calidad y durabilidad.
3,The Naga Pro remains one of the few mice on the market that has a ridge down the right hand side (for a right handed version) where you can place your ring finger or pinkie depending on your grip. For me this is essential. Can't use a mouse that doesn't have it.However this new version of the Naga is made of a much cheaper plastic than the old version (which still sells 2nd hand on Ebay for >£100 because it's so good) and is significantly wider and less comfortable. It's also lighter and thereby less smooth on any surface imperfection.As with all Razer gear it's far too expensive of course. It's not worth half this price. There are Chinese brands with this design that improve with every passing week.It's still the best mouse around for my needs but a step down from what it used to be.
5,I play a number of different genres on my gaming PC. I play World of Warcraft with the '12 button MMO' style which worked very well as most who have used Naga's in the past. Found it hard to get used to after using it for the first while never having used an MMO mouse before; kept catching myself still using the number row out of habit but one I got use to it works far better using the mouse buttons and not having to take your fingers off of the WASD keys. Also is quite large so some people may have troubles reaching all the buttons with re-positioning your hand on the mouse depending on the size of ones hand.Use the 'Hex' style for Survival type games like Subnautica/Empyrion and MOBA's like HotS. As mentioned before; very convenient not having to take your hands off of the movement buttons as well in most survival games. Hex works great too for MOBA's as anyone with experience can tell you.Also play FPS and shooters like Arma and Planetside 2 with the '2 button' style plate. Gives the mouse a Deathadder like feel. Laying down some mean kill streaks with it daily. :DGreat feel to all the attachable plates that are held solidly in place by magnets. I was kinda worried actually by the look of the mouse before I bought it. But I am more than happy with it once I got my hands on it. Really solid product.Razer Synapse 3.0 is still in beta and the mouse is not compatible with Synapse 2. unfortunately I have encountered some bugs on the software side as my custom macros being reset and lighting effects disappearing on two separate occasions off my list of presets which was kind of a downer but now issues since that has happened.Overall a excellent right-handed mouse which can handle many genres and serves as 3 mice in 1.
3,I love this mouse but for the price the quality is simply not there. The mouse has huge holes that let dust and particles under the buttons.  Around 5 months after purchase the left mouse button (which I use most) is glitchy making the mouse completely unreliable (missed clicks missed double clicks sometimes a single click results in a double-click click and drag is failing). I tried regular maintenance but it did not help. Note that I am a PC tech. Their support and RMA process left me frustrated. After going through a huge troubleshooting procedure that took me a week I eliminated the "software" causes. Yeah I know when a mouse button is about to die just wanted a replacement... Still being asked to jump through hoops by Razor to this day! Now they want me to prove it with a video... I'm never buying a Razor product again!
1,I purchased this mouse in Jan of 2020.  I have previously purchased other Razer products so I trusted the brand. Big mistake.About a month in I noticed some weird behaviour from the mouse. Thinking it was user error and me needing to adjust to the new mouse.The mouse would randomly double click or let go of the click without me actually letting go of the left click button. This would happen off and on for about another month.After 3 months the problem got worse and worse to the point that I could not play any games with this mouse. It was simply to unreliable and unplayable.I contacted Razer support. First they tell me my warranty expired in December of 2019. I have proof of purchase and registered my product in 2020... First sign something was wrong.I sent them my invoice as proof of purchase. This time they try and wiggle out by saying that even though I purchased my Razer Naga on Amazon. I apparently used a 3rd party supplier? That is not an authorized reseller?Why is this product on amazon? why is available for sale if it does not come with warranty and the MANUFACTURER of the product does not authorize or recognize its sale?I the customer am penalized for amazon market place rules and restrictions? This is the most near sighted approach to customer retention.Buyer beware read the FAQ's and sort reviews by negative first. That is the lesson learned. This mouse uses mechanical switches that appear to be failing at remarkable rates. Simply scroll through all the negative reviews for the corroboration you need to avoid this product
5,At first glance one may find this mouse quite expensive but this product is totally worth it! Considering the money you would spend on 3 different mouses this is in fact cheaper than one would expect.The mouse comes with 3 different modules. I use the 12-button one to play RPGs like Torchlight where I would have to press 1-10 and basically my hand would have to go back and forth across the keyboard to use these 10 skills. but with the new Naga I could just use my right thumb for the skills and left hand focusing on Z and X which are hotkeys for life/mana potions. I did have a hard time finding the right key to push but as I get used to it it's far more convenient than using the keyboard for skills.The  7-button one is more universal in my opinion. I frequently use photoshop and other productivity software and the 7 buttons prove to be quite handy when I bind them to the most used hotkeys. They are also convenient for games that have some frequently pressed hotkeys say ctrl for most of them Q/F/S for Red Alert 3 etc.For the 2-button mode I kinda find it less interesting. In some sense I would prefer a DeathAdder over the new Naga because the DeathAdder is lighter and suits my habit of holding the mouse with three fingers.And the most interesting thing about this mouse is that the three modules can be hot-switched meaning they can be removed and replaced by another without plugging/unplugging the mouse. I'm using laptops so this does not seem useful but imagine you are using it for a desktop PC and you can literally switch between 3 mouses without having to reach for the cabinet which is supposedly below your desk. Surely this mouse saves you a lot of time.
3,I love the hardware. The mouse is comfortable to use all day long. There are three side pieces to choose from based on how many buttons you want on the side. I use the 7 button circular layout 100% of the time.The problem with this mouse is the software. Razer's terms and conditions basically let them track everything you do with the mouse. Also for some reason it won't load it's profile after rebooting the machine. I have to manually load the Synapse software after every reboot then unplug and replug in the mouse for it to be detected and start working correctly again. It'll then work fine until the next time I reboot. (Note: I'm using this on a macOS machine a Windows machine may not have this issue).Final note I'm continuing to use this mouse mainly because I can't find a replacement with as many side buttons. But I'm tempted to delete the official software and use a third party tool.
4,Esta version del razer naga pro solo se puede configurar con Synapse 3 la cual no esta disponible para Mac. Pero... puedes configurarlo en una PC Windows y guardar hasta 5 configuraciones en la memoria del mouse. Lo que permite utilizarlo en Mac despues de haberlo configurado en Windows. Solo por esas molestias le doy 4 puntos. Dicen que no son muy duraderos los mouses de Razer asi que ya regresare a actualizar mi opinion cuando se rompa.
2,it's actually quite a nice mouse.  good size and good fit for my small hands.  works ok for claw/fingertip grip but it's not very good if you regularly pick up your mouse while using it.  with the 12 button panel it's even more difficult.  it's also quite heavy with no weight adjustments available.the features are just awesome.  2 7 and 12 button panels make it extremely versatile.  the rgb feature is quite pretty but only useful for showing off as you'll never look at the mouse while using it.  the software is extremely bloated (several hundred megs... u kidding me?) but the features are great.  highly configurable dpi settings reconfigurable buttons and macros and what not. the works.  I've been using razer synapse for years and it's always been buggy and this is no exception.  synapse 3 seems less unusable than the previous version though.unfortunately my mouse was faulty.  holding down scroll wheel also initiates auto scroll up.  did the same thing on a different computer without razer installed so a hardware issue.  returning it and will have to reconsider my options.
4,Este es el segundo mouse que compro de razer el primero fue un naga epic el cual se rompió por dentro y se le terminó hinchando la pila (que sirve para usarlo wireless).Me acostumbré a tener los 12 botones en el mouse me gusta que se puedan intercambiar ya que vienen otros 2 módulos con menos botones pero como lo uso mucho para juegos me vienen genial los 12 botones :)Responde muy bien es preciso y fácil de configurar.
2,This mouse can be great at first especially if you play a multitude of different games but after just a month of use it starts failing and I simply realized that the swappable side panel is more of a gimmick than a feature.I used it the first week and never swapped the 12 buttons layout ever again (since I use it for work and games anyway). The only thing I like more on this mouse compared to my Redragon Impact is that the middle button can be clicked on both sides as well as the middle click though it started failing. More on this later.The build quality on the outside is good and doesn't get as dirty or greasy as my last mouse.The internal quality is crap though.The left click inconsistently stops dragging even when you're still pressing down which can be quite a bummer in a couple games. This issue seems random since I can't force it's behaviour in any way. It just happens when you don't want it to happen.I mentioned that I liked the middle button being clickable on each sides but after 2 weeks of use the middle left button almost always gets pressed when the middle button is pressed directly down. It's avoidable by clicking precisely straight down but most of the time in the middle of a Tarkov firefight it will trigger a shooting macro or simply when attempting to scroll a webpage with the middle mouse button it will cancel annoyingly.I've read reviews mentioning that it is hard to rest the thumb without pressing a button on the 12 buttons layout which I totally agree with but it takes 2 weeks to get used to resting the thumb a little higher.The buttons are hard to distinguish since they are sitting even and not angled in a pattern like the ones on the Redragon Impact.I will try to contact Razer in order to find out if these issues can be corrected. In the meantime I shall keep using this mouse and not revert to my Redragon Impact because I got used to the software and I can live with the issues I mentioned earlier. I am merely complaining because of the fact that this 120$ mouse has more problems than a 35$ one.
4,I just bought this mouse because I work with AutoCAD and I wanted a mouse that I could use for many of my commands. I originally tried a logitech mx master s2 however although being an awesome mouse its software did not support macros. which are a must if you are going to be using a mouse for CAD. This mouse has lots of buttons for CAD commands.Enter the first hiccup: good and bad software. This mouse uses the new synapse 3.0 software which has an obscene amount of features from macros to lighting. However it also has some major issues. I have only used it for a few days and already it has crashed on me about 6 times. Most of this was because I started adding macros and then binding them to the buttons and since this model has on board storage it was trying to send it to the mouse but it was failing for some reason. Because of that it lagged out and froze up and could only be fixed with a full system reboot.The second hiccup: synapse 3.0 allows your to set mouse commands for different programs. So if you are using AutoCAD for example and then flick over to a website it will switch your mouse button commands as well. Sadly this can cause lag and the software does not switch quickly or smoothly.Third: I originally bought this mouse for its 12 side button attachment however the buttons lack any difference from one another and its difficult to know which button your thumb is on without taking a few seconds to confirm. Simply adding a few ridges to specific buttons would have made all the difference. In the end even though I bought this mouse for all the buttons I have ended up using the 7 side button attachment because it is significantly easier to tell what button you are clicking. I also personally find it easier to handle the mouse with this attachment since it has a rubber grip in the middle of the buttons.Having listed all my concerns with this mouse. I still find Razer mice to be the most comfortable in the hand and when you do get the software up and running its fantastic. That said if you are buying this for all the buttons I would recommend looking at an MMO mouse with more contour to them.If you are looking for a mouse to use with CAD I also recommend staying with a gaming mouse because these are the only ones that will have software that you can program macros into. Meaning that you can record full commands as well as the enter stroke in one button.If you just want a really comfortable mouse the best mouse I have every used is Razer's Deathadder series. Not as many buttons but super comfortable.
1,Great hardware. Real bad software. Eating 20 to 90% of your RAM CPU cycle in the high end. Not Amazon fault. Will look for a gaming mouse with less software issues. I have a monster gaming rig anything as a mouse driver who eat that much memory with 64GIG of RAM not acceptable. Will shop for a gaming mouse who does not have beta drivers. Do not buy this product if you are an IT person who checks your resources.
5,I purchased this 3 months ago to replace my original Razer Naga mouse which is 8 years old and still working great even after much World of Warcraft playing and snack sticky fingers.I'd bought a new gaming computer so kept the original Naga on the older systemstill used daily for all but gaming.The new Razer Naga Trinity is overkill I only want the 12 button side panel but so far it seems every bit the same good quality of my 8 yr old original.Now I can change the colour scheme so that's an improvement and it costs relatively the same as what I paid 8 years back.Great quality and value for money.One downside is the software misbehaviour on my older iMac the rzupdater would pin my CPU at times... The windows based software is much more reliable so far.
1,Este mouse tiene un fallo de diseño en los microswitches mecánicos que causa que se dañen al poco tiempo de uso la garantía de razer no aplica en México y si pasa la devolución de Amazon tampoco aplica su garantía así que te quedas con un mouse inservible no tengo nada en contra de razer todos los dispositivos que tengo son razer pero en este me temo que si han fallado es el segundo mouse trinity que tengo y fallo exactamente igual que el primero definitivamente no lo recomiendo el Logitech g600 resiste más mucho más.UPDATE: No habia actualizado el review espero les sirve se puede corregir ya que cuesta tan caro al menos aplicar una solucion "temporal" si se abre el mouse con cuidado y se abre el microswitch y se reemplaza o solo se quita la tapa en mi caso le quite la tapa se hace un ligero doblez en la plaquita de cobre del microswitch y se vuelve a poner la tapa del microswitch es un terrible error de diseño pero eso al menos compensa lo que uno ha gastado en este mouse No es lo optimo ni algo que un usuario deberia hacer pero al menos te ayuda a lidiar con el gasto que hiciste y que ahora tu mouse carisimo no funcione a los dos meses darle mas tiempo de vida y uso lo compensa si quieren ayuda con eso para explicarles como pueden contactarme o buscarle en youtube hay tutorial para eso.
1,When you get a mouse there are some core features that ought not to have any problems. Simple clicking movement form the basis of what anyone needs out of a mouse. This mouse falls short in those key features through a documented fault that is apparently not fixed. Instead of spending money on this mouse look at getting something else. Otherwise details below.This line of mice from Razer suffers from a faulty left click - at times it will double click at other times it won't click at all. When I looked the issue up plenty of people noting this appear online. There are tutorials on how to fix it that require you to not only dismantle the mouse but dismantle the switches. From there you must bend a small copper wire. This process is time consuming requires you to remove adhesive pads on the mouse that cannot be reapplied after removed (making you buy new ones) and requires you to own several small bits.This is a known fault that appears across several mice that use these switches so why Razers insists on using these again and again is beyond me.
3,I bought a razer naga in 2014 the thing is built like a tank still to this day nothing shakes or rattles the mouse wheel is silky smooth and all the bottom are nearly silent.I decided that I wanted to get a new naga nothing is wrong with my 2014 model I bet that thing could serve me till the day I die but I just wanted a spare naga to use with my other devices... Anyways I bought this naga trinity and it lacks all the good qualities of the 2014 model it's flimsy the left and right mouse buttons are loose the mouse wheel has very aggressive bumps in the spinning of it which vibrates the mouse and makes a loud clicking noise and the whole things feels like it is made of a slightly cheaper plastic. All of the button on it are very loud in fact they are twice as loud as the keys on my mechanical keyboard.I want to return this mouse But I know I will not be able to find an unused 2014 model so I guess I just have to settle for this new model.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 BE WARNED!! The most horrible performances one can get out of a mouse.I have no idea if it's an issue with the mouse or with Synapse 3 software(but the mouse requires Synapse 3 to function so it's the same) but the mouse will freeze for 2-3 seconds EVERY SINGLE TIME you change profiles.Apparently this is a common problem and has been known for over a year Razer has no intention of fixing it.With this bug my mouse is basically an unusable brick.STAY AWAY.I repeat. DO NOT BUY.
2,Great mouse but if you are hoping to buy all their stuff (mouse headphones keyboard and side keypad) as I did simply because you want all the LEDs to work together and to avoid having several programs running in the background for each one don't bother.  Some items you have to use their V3 synapse which has been in beta for 2 years and some you have to use their V2 synapse software.Also their site promises profiles but the repository is empty.  Such a shame so much potential and good hardware.
1,So I had an issue with the first one they sent me where none of the side buttons work. I went to razer website and followed trouble shooting instructions and it still did not work. So I ordered a replacement from Amazon the new one arrives and exact same issue except this time the side buttons worked for about 20 min before it failed. I had an older version of the Razer Naga and it was amazing for years without any issues. I'm very disappointed with the quality. Feels like razer has gone downhill and wouldn't recommend getting this mouse.
3,Have been using this mouse for over a year and it has been a great mouse but it is starting to not register some clicks and likes to unclick while dragging pages from monitor to monitor or copying large amounts of text.I have used this mouse daily between 4-14 hours a day mostly 8 hours daily and use it for work and gaming have probably put at least a million clicks on this but will be going with a different brand this time. Overall this would be a great mouse for mid level gamers that won’t beat the heck out of it playing games just not the best for me.
3,Why is it so noisy!?!? I bought this to replace my old razer mouse that died. It seems to be better quality than my last one which lasted a very long time. It's a little larger than I expected and very noisy to click. I wonder if it's intentional because it's meant for gamers and they need to hear their clicks? My last mouse was silent a small click is acceptable to me but this is going to drive me insane. I have my computer in my family room where other people are watching tv and it annoys the hell out of everyone! I play a game that requires constant nonstop clicking. I click on average 300 times PER MINUTE for 8 hours a day.... other than that it seems to be a good mouse but its not a good fit for me.
5,I like this mouse as it has 3 interchangeable sides: death adder Naga Hex (6 button side)  and the Naga (12 button side). I tend to use the 2 of the 3 depending on what I am doing whether gaming or facebooking. I have a corded one so not sure how the battery one works. My favorite mouse was always the death adder. Where as my husband loves his Naga  (12 side buttons) which for my fat thumb never made me happy. The Naga hex though is great too so I tend to switch back and forth between the Death adder and the hex now without having to change the whole mouse.I have always found Razer mice to be reliable and this one is no different. well made comfortable glides wonderfully sleek looking has shinnies (lights) and now with 3 different mice rolled into one by interchangeable sides.totally recommend if you are like me and want 2 different mice one for gaming and one for daily things without the extra buttons.
1,This friggin mouse took control of my PC will not allow PC to sleep/hibernate. Google tricks didn't work This is an ongoing  issue with Razer for at least 6 yrs FIX IT!  I DO NOT want to take I.T. course in order for my mouse to work as directed.2) issue with software: wouldn't allow MIC to work. Now here's the fun  part TRY un-installing all those files installed by  Razer. Not to  mention registry 70+ files. It took me 8 hrs to clean all that stuff off  my PC JUST to have  my mic working. Email them? OFC I did still waiting for reply.
1,Avant que vous ne lisiez ceci sachez que je suis Fan des produits RAZER depuis longtemps et je possède plusieurs produits actuellement qui n'ont pas de problème.J'ai acheté la souris en janvier 2020. Depuis quelques jours maintenant la souris "double-clic" gauche 15%-20% du temps. Ça occasionne toutes sortes de problèmes dans les jeux et des erreurs couteuses et aussi c'est vraiment pas agréable. En plus du Double-clic Gauche de temps en temps le Clic Droit bloque et ne veut plus fonctionner. Je dois alors "frapper" la souris contre le bureau pour débloquer la "switch". et dernière chose. La roulette n'est pas précise. un peu fatiguant avec le temps. J'ai eu une Razer Naga première génération pendant 8 ANS avant qu'elle ne commence a avoir LE MÊME problème (Switch de gauche seulement). 8 ans . . . pas 5 mois. Je suis extrèmement déçu de cette achat (remplacement). La qualité chez razer est en baisse depuis quelques années. La souris en soit en un défaut de fabrication. Elle a 3 problèmes. Je recommande parce que j'aime le modèle et le confort mais en même temps la qualité des matériaux et de fabrication n'est pas au RDV pour une souris a 120$. J'attends ma nouvelle souris avant de leur renvoyer celle-là et ce n'est pas une RAZER cette fois . . .
4,Este es mi 3er mouse razer naga (no todos fueron comprados en amazon) en general Razer es una marca cara pero ultimamente los articulos son cada vez mas delicados. No les doy un uso rudo o mal trato . lo primero que les falla es el optico luego el boton de click izquierdo que es el que mas se usa.Los sigo comprando porque todo mi set es Razer y me gusta el chroma tambien los botones laterales de numeros son muy comodos para juegos MMO.Mi recomendacion seria buscar una opcion mas economica y que ofrezca lo mismo.
2,El mouse funciona como cualquier otro mouse de 10 dólares tan pronto y lo conectas.El problema está en que la compañía (Razer) decidió ya no actualizar su software Synapse para la Mac el cual se quedó en la versión 2 y ya no es compatible con el OS Catalina en adelante.Esto hace inservible la funcionalidad extra del mouse que es por lo que normalmente uno lo compra.Sí sirve para Windows con su Synapse 3.Lo más deplorable es que Razer no da la cara en este tema no hay ningún comunicado oficial y no indica que NO SIRVE para Mac.
3,I love the mouse it's fun having the 3 different options easy to switch between the 3. Although sometimes the mouse wont read which one you switched too sometimes but if you move it around it will eventually work. Not a big deal. I do find the 12 button side a little too sensitive on press but you just have to get used to it basically. Otherwise good mouse! Keep taking care of it and it should last a long time!
1,Pésimo antes tenía un Razen naga normal y no tuve problemas con el este a los pocos meses han empezado a fallar los botones de click no reconoce el click si tienen algún modelo anterior mejor quédense con el a cambiar por este modelo tan malo
4,If your mouse cant connects to the razer software.; use task manager to end all razer tasks click the more details to see all the tasked running and end-all razer tasked then reopen razer. Reopen razer synapses might not open right away once you manage to get it to open to work and the mouse will connect. if you have trouble opening the razer the issue will only happen once. when razer finally open it will open with out issue ion the future.
5,I previously had a Naga Hex v2 for 5 years and was time to replace it as I think dust was causing the middle click to be less reliable.This Naga Trinity version is even better than my previous mouse. The sensor is better and more accurate. The button switches feel more satisfying to press and more consistent. On top of all that it is modular now with replaceable side buttons. That's great as I only really need the MOBA/MMO side buttons when I play those games. Now I can change to the more ergonomic and comfortable 2 button layout in all the other times I am using the computer. All with the same mouse!
1,Update: After 11 months of light to medium usage I started experiencing the same issues with the left click as many other reviewers. Support hasn't been great either. Extremely disappointed in this product.Original review:The concept of having 3 different button configurations is a great idea. The buttons are easy to press and I find it very responsive. I tend to use the 7 button attachment based on the games I play and I am finding it a bit difficult to get used to it. This is mostly because I am coming from the 1st generation Naga Hex mouse that only had 6 buttons which was perfect for me. The mouse wheel feels a little loose compared to previous models but I am adjusting to it.
2,Unfortunately there are issues with this controller that came up unexpectedly. You may experience a double clicking issue caused by springs catching internally. This can be remedied by using it for longer or contacting the manufacturer. If you do this you will be asked to pay for a new mouse ship back your old mouse and wait for the manufacturer to receive said defective mouse before your new mouse is even shipped... This was unacceptable practice for me unfortunately because I couldn't afford another $100+ mouse let alone go without a mouse for days on end.Due to a poor RMA process I would suggest other company's alternatives like corsair or steel series.I got stuck with a defective product which I had to use untill the problem solved itself from excessive wear. Not cool.
4,It's been a bit of an adjustment in adapting to this mouse. I previously had a Razer Deathadder 2014 Chroma. This mouse is quite a bit wider and makes it so I have to completely re-adjust my posture and technique. The multiple swap-able panels are wonderful! I was a bit wary at first but the magnetic lock for them works like a charm. There is no ridge or any noticeable texture around where the panels click in. You wouldn't even know the panels are swap-able otherwise. The panels themselves hot swap with zero issue. Most of my testing has been through gaming on World of Warcraft Heroes of the Storm Elder Scrolls Online and EvE. In all instances hot swapping between the different panels in the middle of a game is also no issue the software and game both recognize the swap immediately and the new button set starts working as expected with no delay or reset.The features on this mouse are endless. It uses the latest Sync 3 software from Razer. Which I believe is still mostly in beta. But it's nice. I won't even talk about all the features as there are just too many to get in to here. But some highlights are the on the fly adjustable DPI. Totally customizable in the software from 100 through 16000 DPI with presets you can make for the top mouse buttons to cycle through. Different Chroma patterns and settings that are also endless.Overall I've had pretty good luck with Razer products. I am very active in many gaming communities and know there are very mixed reviews on their products. However this one is a huge hit for me and I am really happy with my purchase and swap. Even though it has taken me a while to adjust to all the new buttons and wider layout of the mouse.
5,For gaming - It won't let me download and install the new app... works decent out of box but i want to tweak.Ergonomic- its nice and sleek comfortable fit into the had. The extra buttons so useful for MMO's.Comfort - the pinky grip is just the best makes it so easy to re adjust spacing. Especially when everything is set up I barely use any space at all.
1,Unfortunately I have had to rescind my positive review. The quality of the micro-switches in this mouse is abysmal. After 6 months of use the microswitch in the left mouse button failed. I bought a second hand razer years ago and the same thing happened to it in short order leading me to think that Razer just uses really pour quality switches.You could get away with this on the side switches but the left and right mouse button switches should be of the absolute top quality as they see the most abuse.I have since replaced this mouse with a Logitech G502 and will not be returning to Razer until it is clear they have changed the button suppliers!
5,So I was in need of a mouse and really liked thr Corsair Scimitar - by looks for having that 12-button panel. Bought it almost liked the ergonomics liked the weight and generally was happy until I decided to change default keybinds.iCUE is .. for lack of the better word horrible. I got so frustrated with it that decided to get new mouse and got this one (Since I already have Razer Tartarus).Well my only regret is that I didn't think of Razer mouse in the beginning. It is brilliant in every regard and I love swappable side plates.Software is so incredibly straightforward and easy to use I did all the changes I wanted in 3 minutes (rebind 2 buttons adjust sensitivity reduce brightness). With iCUE it was a punishment with every step.Razer all the way. My old keyboard will need replacement soon and I already know maker of the new one.
1,Falla al mes de uso casi acabando la garantia... razer es una marca que vive de la sombra de su pasado... antes ofrecian productos de calidad y de uso rudo para gammers y ahora hasta el petalo de una rosa lo daña  Es caro para la calidad tan nefasta que tiene  les hago un Favor no gasten su dinero en razer de verdad que hay mucho mejores opciones y casi un 65% menos de lo que valen estos de razer....P.d los fallos son Doble click o triple  se vuelve loco y empiesa a marcar todos los botones de un castado conpletamente solo..Solucion . Un par de martillasos y a la basura.
1,I have been a long time razer fan since 2009. Purchased many keyboards mouse headphone accessory hydra orbweaver and the works. The mouse stopped working about 5 months in. And the razer.com support is ignoring even the request to proceed with the rma request. Very disappointed by the declaining quality.
1,I wanted a mouse for video editing but when adding macros it would always take 2 or 3 clicks before it worked. I think this mouse actually showed me down. Very unreliable. I returned it.
1,Got mine in january to replace an older Naga model. In june I was already having issues with it double clicking. Contacted Razer support as it was still under warranty they made me go through all kinds of hoops requesting video proof of the issue I was describing (!?) and overall weren't willing to replace the item despite it being 6 months old.This was my 4th Razer mouse. The first old Naga Hex I got was good and lasted for years.. then it all went downhill on the next ones with side buttons not responding double clicking settings getting reset randomly or just plain not being detected by my pc needing to be disconnected and reconnected every time I'd boot my pc.My Razer Naga Trinity ended up flying through my living room. I now own a Logitech G203 which I highly recommend.
1,These are made with cheap parts I fear. after a few months of use the left click begins double clicking on you and while dragging things around it can release on its own even though you finger is held down.Might be a cheap spring under the button.Customer support has been a huge hassle and in the end I still have a busted mouse.
1,If you have a choice go for a Naga or any MMO mouse . There's tons on connection issues alot of time the number pad will just stop working . I honestly only use the 12 number pad and the two button pads and even tho switching is easy enough  the connection issues and dead spots kills the convenience of being able to switch .
1,I bought one with scratches on the bottom so I asked for a replacement and this second one has uneven feet so it wobbles so I asked for another replacement which has loose scroll wheel left and right click that all rattles with a slight touch. This third one also have a much rougher texture and the side buttons all sound and feel different compared to the other two which is very interesting considering they are the same product.I am now waiting for the fourth mouse of this very product and I am pretty sure it's going to have some problem of its own.
1,The mouse is a lot lighter than trinity but too light for MMORPG or MOBA feels more like a FPS mouse. The left and right click have a longer travel distance much louder feels like cheap chinese mouse. The scroll wheel is the worst thing on the mouse it doesn't tilt and it's one of those silent scroll wheels with a lot of friction making it very hard to scroll through anything. Why put a silent scroll wheel on a gaming mouse when you make every button louder than the trinity??? They strip down the mouse with less features a crappy scroll wheel and cheap feeling switches but charge you more for it???
5,I've gone through my fair share of gaming mice over the years but this is the first Razer product I ever got. It is honestly the best mouse I've ever used. Currently I use the wheel panel for MMOs and the buttons are super clicky easy to press but not to the point that you would accidentally press them.
1,The magnet side panels are very cool. The rest of the mouse is horrible and the basic functionality of the mouse- being able to click on things -is absolute garbage.This mouse cannot click and drag it will "let go" every single time. Clicking once is a roll of the dice you'll probably click twice on single press. This is a 'known issue' for Razer mice and especially these. If you want a reliable mouse don't buy this. I own two they're both like this you can find discussions online about how bad these are.The only consistent thing is that the mouse click sucks. Razer software is a bloaty mess. Very disappointed by this "premium" mouse. Had to follow Youtube video of some guy taking the switch apart and fixing the spring so the click finally worked.
1,The concept of being able to change the side where the mouse keys is nice especially for RPG games.Top two mouse buttons are quite sensitive.A year after buying the mouse started acting up. Its as if it the sensor is oversensitive and randomly (often)  click twice when I click once. This is the case for left and right clicking. No point in telling you that when gaming this is a REAL problem that could cost you a lot in some games. This is a deal breaker for me and it's even worse considering that it seems I'm not the only one with this problem...Conclusion: the concept is very very good but the engineering seems to be at fault which should not be the case considering the price of the mouse. I do not recommend.
2,Software is quite irritating - anything that requires you to sign in to adjust your hardware is pretty bad. And then theres the fact that the parts arent as good as a logitech mouse meaning that a few days ago less than a year after purchasing the left click started multiclicking (google “razer naga click problem to find dozens of others with the same issue). I had a regular naga before this that succumbed to the same issue. Needless to say I will be switching to a logitech numpad mouse soon.And who cares about pretty lighting with all of the issues?
4,I really like this mouse it replaced an older Wireless Razer Naga but one you needed to attached via a wireless receiver to your computer to use. The bluetooth functionality is amazing and its what I envisioned what the older wireless mouse should have been. It just connects via bluetooth wth no need for a dongle.The only issue a Mac user should be aware of (that I didn't know before) is that to customise the mouse buttons etc you need to use the Razer Synapse software which is no longer being developed for MacOS.So if you have an up to date Mac you cannot run the software.
2,I tried to replace a Roccat Nyth with this...Feels cheap and button assignment are lame (from a product design point of view)The worst part is how Razer assigns the side buttons: it's the same key code as keyboard numpad.It makes it pretty damn useless in Linux.
2,I owned the 2013 version of the Naga and enjoyed it for almost five years before the mouse-wheel eventually gave up. It was easily the best peripheral I'd ever purchased for PC gaming and so I immediately followed it up with the successor Trinity for more of the same.And I got it at least for a little while. But about 12 months after purchase the right mouse button began develop issues. Clicks were doubled or refused to register. The problem was intermittent and seemed to resolve itself after a few blasts of air or a harder press of the fingers but week after week the problem got worse. To the point where I had to transfer all functionality for the right mouse button to another key.Two weeks ago the mousewheel has begun skipping inputs failing to scroll as it once did. A blast of air seemed to fix the problem but then this morning the same mouse button issue has begun to afflict the left button.I understand the switches in this generation have become a frequent problem for many users and after a year of ownership I can see why. Build quality has slid down-hill in recent years and it seems the Naga is yet another sign of flash over substance for this company.  After receiving a replacement for a factory defect in my Razer Blackwidow  Chroma keyboard (and a second failure after 16 months) I think I'm done with Razer.  Explore your options don't buy into the hype.
1,Box packaging had noticeable damage in a few spots. Once opened everything seemed okay until I plugged the mouse in. My cursor would move but my computer started acting strangley and was unable to use my start menu or click any windows open or closed.Noticed the scroller wheel was very stiff and found it to be pushed over out of alignment which I believe was causing the menu and scrolling problems. When I went to go register my product in razer synapse someone else's log in credentials were already in the browser and I had to log out and log in with my own. Pretty clear someone else had already received and returned this product because of the issues I found with with the mouse.It works now but disappointed because I wouldn't have spent $96 on an open/returned/defective mouse.
5,I had this mouse for 2 years before the left click button died it covered all games from MMO's to FPS. I just purchased another because I like the way it fit in my hand it didnt cramp my hand up. It also has thumb buttons for almost any game play/type.It just came out of the box lets see how long this one lasts! Hopefully longer then two years.
5,Llevo más de 6 meses con el naga pro wireless lo tengo en windows 10 con synapse razer lo que hace que funcione bien.... el usb que funciona como antena de bluetooth debe ir directamente en la laptop o pc nunca en un hub de usb o extensión ya que esto le quita response al mouse no me ha fallado ni un poco uso el de 12 numeros laterales y sin problema....Tambien tuve el wired y duro 2 años hasta que lo vendi ambos excelentes.
1,I have had my mouse for about 9 months looks brand new still but it has started to double click and is not useful anymore as i can't do anything with it. The quick change side panels were nice but I found the MMO buttons extremely uncomfortable  compared to the prior model the Razer Naga of which i had owned two. I very much loved the old style. The feel is okay with the two side buttons. I would NOT BUY THIS mouse for the price it is a rip off. I am extremely disappointed.
3,Overall it is a decent mouse with some issues.The right click is loose there is some play between the button housing and the switch beneath it. For a premium product at this price point this level of build quality is unacceptable.The way that this mouse handles onboard profiles is also less than ideal only certain settings are stored on the device the rest of the features would require you to have Synapse 3 active for you to access them. The lighting intensity setting for example is stored on the device itself but the lighting mode is not. Without the software active it would revert to it's default lighting mode. But this problem is not merely cosmetic it also reared its ugly head on buttons assignment. Certain button functions would require Synapse 3 to be running for them to work (profile switch comes to mind).My old mouse from another big brand does not require any software to be active to achieve full functions. So it is definitely possible engineering wise just that apparently that Razer doesn't have the best designers. Also ironically my older Razer mouse don't suffer from this problem.
2,Nous avons acheter la souris Elle avais l'air de fonctionner a la perfection mais moins d'une semaine plus tard elle faisais des double clique. Pas pratique quand on joue a LOL (déplace une potion utilise la dite potion) et pour Dofus nom plus.) J'ai peut-être eu de la malchance et commander pendent un défaut de manufacture ce qui me pousse a mettre 2 étoile car la souris étais super pendent la première semaine.
5,First impressions I love this mouse. Some people have said it's heavy but I find it to be lighter than a G900 (despite it weighing more). The ergonomics are great and fits my hand near perfectly with my palm grip. The clicking is very comfortable and everything is good so far. I will update if something goes wrong but if it stays at 5 stars then assume everything is fine!
4,Good mouse  I have been using razer nagas since 1st generation ever . They are good in quality I still have one from 2009 which works just the cable is bent / melted after 11yrs of use but still works.So trinity is a good option to swap between day to day work and mmorpg
4,I've been using the razer naga trinity for about a year now I haven't had too much problems with it until a month back where my right mouse button has become almost like jammed where i play an fps and aim in and it aims unaims constantly until i have to press uncomfortably hard for it to stay aimed in and I'm not the type of person to use mouses very roughly either. Other than that the mouse has held up great the swapable buttons work amazing if you're that type of person to play mobas and such. The mouse feels kind of awkward sometimes with long use because of how it's shaped but you get used to it for the most part.
1,al principio muy perfeto luego las luces dejaron de prender cuando cambio de botones y por lo general no funcionan y parece tener un falso a la hora de acoplar las caras del mouse la verdad es buen mouse pero esto le quita todo sera defecto.
5,Very comfortable in the hand even after extended gaming sessions. The chroma feature is a nice bonus and the overall feel and quality of this mouse is fantastic. Having the number pad on the side of the mouse is a game changer if you play MMO games. Really great pickup you will not be disappointed.
5,Have been using  about 2 months. Received as the product request. Box a bit damage but is not a issue. Since have been using for wow I never change to other plate. Once u get used to it you will not regret buying it for wow. Especially for shaman player a lot of button to press so this is good enough. As well as you are at it also buy razer tartarus with it. Once u get used to it you never turn back to keyboard =p. Perfect for small - medium hand. Big hand need to consider o sample first if can. Last sample seen  is at popular or challenger
1,First time i bought a Razer product and I am disapointed with the mouse 4 months in and the left click is already non responsive 50% of the time playing shooter with that defect is a pain so ill have to buy another mouse just because of it.
1,No lo compres es un mouse de muy mala calidad razer dejo de hacer buenas cosas hace años yo le traté de dar una última oportunidad y me estoy arrepintiendo el mouse menlo cambiaron 3 veces en menos de 15 días y al final a los 45 días fallo de nuevo es de la misma calidad que algún producto de aliexpres si quieres tirar tu dinero cómpralo.
3,Ive bought two of these now. It is a very nice mouse with usefulness in all different games. The interchangeable sideplates are awesome for gaming and all other day to day use. However with both of the ones I have owned are used in heavily competitive gameplay. The left click stops working after only a few months of use. Great mouse just doesn't last long enough to justify the price every few months
5,Los diferentes tapas permiten experimentar varios juegos sin problema alguno además el fácil cambio de niveles de DPI permiten alternar entre un nivel o mayor dependiendo de la situación.Los colores son completamente personalizables al igual que el estilo en el que se presentan.Es muy cómodo y los botones son de gran calidad.
2,I got this because I have the 2011 naga I've liked it and its pretty much dead now. When I got this mouse the first thing I noticed is that I don't like the grip. It is basically using the large side grip from the old naga.The next thing I noticed is that it is basically impossible to lift / pick up without pressing the buttons on the 12 button attachment. because of the design on the right side of the mouse you need to use your thumb to lift it off the mat. Every time I lifted it I started pressing the buttons. They are way to soft so soft that even moving it around on the mouse pad without lifting I would press them. The only way i could avoid that required me to hold the mouse with it pointing towards the left meaning that if I moved my hand straight forwards my cursor moves up and to the left.If you are buying this as a replacement for the old naga look for another mouse.
4,A veces en medio de un juego se puede desprender un poco la tapa de los botones por moverlos muy rápido y/o fuerte seria mejor que saquen el de los 12 botones sin que se intercambien para que no ocurra este problema pero como me ocurre muy pocas veces y se soluciona fácil (al desprenderlo y volver a poner en su lugar) no lo criticó tanto.
2,I have been through 5 Razer Naga since 2009 they all end up having the same issue.The left-click starts to not register correctly it double-click on itself while holding it down it releases by itself then clicks again...The last one I bought only worked great for a few months then the click issue started.Other than that it is to me the perfect mouse for my MMORPG
4,This purchase was made for my boyfriend for Christmas so unfortunately I cannot give a straight review from use; however he loves it. He said it was smooth to use and the removing of the side panels was easy to switch. I don’t think he has mentioned anything negative about it yet. I’m still waiting for him to have it a little longer though.
1,I've had this mouse for ~1 month and it's quality is bad even for Razer's standards. The left click is already intermittently losing contact when attempting to "drag and drop" something. Even if it looks nice and feels nice - if it's already breaking down within the month it's trash.
5,Battery life: stupid question it's wired lolVersatility: I use the 12 button side for most games. The two button side for at university / web browsing. The 7 button side for certain games such as overwatch. It's situational.For gaming: I literally can't game without it. Heck I can't even play Subnatica without the thumb keys anymore. Its so comfortable the mouse fits perfectly in my hand. The buttons are in a comfortable spot for me to hit. It's an excellent mouse. I have had no problems with it.
1,I've bought this mouse in late June. It is now late September and the left click barely works anymore. I am completely unable to hold it in any way or after maybe a dozen tries I can get it to hold long enough to do a screen capture using windows+shift+s. I've heard it was a common problem with Razor mouses but I wanted to try it out and give them a chance. I completely regret it. That is 100$ that barely even lasted 3 months. A complete joke. I will never see myself another razor mouse. as I now see why people keep complaining about the quality of these subpar products. Don't buy this.
1,Some buttons would double-click out of box no matter what I do with Razer software and the device itself. I thought the buttons are mechanical switches but I doubt it now. Will never purchase Razer mouse again.
1,About 9 months after buying this mouse the left mouse button started having issues including double clicking on a single press not registering clicks unless pressed hard and releasing while holding down the button.  This is unacceptable for a mouse of this price.
5,Awesome mouse perfect for gaming home or office use. Can't say enough good things about it. The exchangeable thumb face-plates are perfect and allows gamers to customize their experiences based on the genre / individual preference. Trust in Razer for computer gear.
5,Me gusto mucho los materiales yo tenia el Razer Naga Elite y este es mucho mejor en cuanto a materiales y construcción lo unico es que es mucho mas grande que cualquier otro mouse y al principio puede ser un poco incomodo pero es cuestion de adaptarse.Si no te gustan los mouse grandes no lo compres.En los juegos funciona perfectamente bien y responde de maravilla
4,Loved the style and I can swap out the side buttons as needed. The grip is a little awkward to hold but does well when using it. While the cost was a bit more it's not worth the quality but then again it's the style lights and name I think that the price matches for.
5,I have had pretty well every version of the Razer Naga and this one continues to impress. The fully programmable buttons are extremely useful for gaming and regular activities. Its amazing how helpful putting simple standard keyboard functions like copy  paste and enter at your thump is and super easy to set up. I personally have no need to the extra attachments but definately see the benefit of being able to swap out the macro button pieces on the side without compromising look feel or function. I will probably cry when I can no longer get a naga mouse.
5,I got this mouse to replace it's older brother the Razer Naga 2014 since the right click switch on the older model was starting to show its age. Performance is great and the interchangeable panels + lighting options are a bonus though I mainly use the 12-button macro pad attachment.~Pros~- sensor is nice and snappy as expected- mouse shape is very comfortable and the ring finger support is a nice touch ( same shape as naga 2014)- rigid construction- rubberized scroll wheel~Cons~- Razer software could be improved- Finish on the plastic shell picks up hand oilsnote: will update this review if reliability becomes an issue or if any other problems rear their nasty heads.
4,Got this today and had extremely fast delivery . Love the feel but I will say the new Razer mice require synapse 3 and older Razer stuff you need synapse 2 so you have to run both synapse which is just ridiculous imo . Old synapse is much easier and user friendly also . This is my third Razer Naga mouse and the previous ones have all had number 2 button failures ... (different sellers) .
1,The right button stoped working after 6 month seen alot of peoples with the same probleme get the old naga or try a diferent brand unless you can afford to buy a new 100$ mouse every 6 month.
1,Mouse worked great for the first 10 months but now when holding left-click to drag files of change window sizes the click stops registering or mysteriously double clicks.  It will open the file instead of dragging it or the window size handle will be dropped.  If my $10 dell mouse can correctly click for 10+ years without fault I am shocked to see a "premium" mouse get these problems after 10 months.  Will see what their warranty process looks like...
5,Apenas llevo 2 meses con él antes usaba un Corsair (no recuerdo el modelo pero tiene el pad numeral del lado izquierdo) y decidí probar este ya que el costo era muy similar. Puedo decir que ha cumplido mis espectativas solo uso el pad numérico pero el tacto de los botones y los materiales se sienten muy bien.
2,This mouse is advertised as "Great for large hands". It's smaller than my existing Logitech G502 SE model which is already quite uncomfortable. The mouse itself is very slippery to the touch and with large hands it is very uncomfortable to pick up or move around. The features will most likely be fantastic for someone with smaller hands but the plastic finish makes your hand slide around when using. Returning.
4,Es muy cómodo los colores y materiales excelente pero después de un año de uso el clic izquierdo comenzó a fallar el primero de 5 mouse Razer. Tal vez solo fue este mouse pero ya comienzo a poner en duda la marca Razer
4,I've used the Naga for awhile now and I love the 12 buttons. I did have the left click fail on me but Razer sent me a whole new mouse. Great when it works but their customer care was decent to deal with.
4,I love Razer mice. This is my second one (first one broke due to angry kid). Lasts a good long while though (Razer mouse before lasted years). The synapse is a little iffy on Mac sometimes but thats not even much of a complaint. Mouse works and is great.
5,Love this mouse best thing I've ever used for gaming. Had to buy a new one as my 2012 version got worn out. The only down side is that on the older Naga there used to be dimples on 12 button keypad so you could feel where your thumb was the newer version does not have any such dimples. After a while I found it was still fairly easy to figure out where I should be pressing for each button.
2,Lo del titulo el plastico del click izquierdo se siente raro no sé bien como explicarlo como si en lugar de dar 1 click dieras 3 clicks no sé explicarme.Actualización: Ya no solo se sienten 3 clicks ahora se dan varios clicks si lo dejas entre apretado
1,Avoid this mouse. I bought it because  I had a Razer keyboard and mousepad as well.Biggest waste of money. The mouse occasionally freezes or gets stuck in a loop where it just randomly goes haywire.Apparently lot of people are having the same issue. Never getting a Razer mouse again
1,This thing is a piece of crap. Started to double click after 6 months. My cheap 20 dollar mouse lasted for 5 years!
1,The mouse is brand new... day 1 of using it and it keeps on disconecting all the time for 2 seconds and then reconnects.Worst part is... it does that when i'm not even touching it.... soit is not a faulty cable (and not the USB port since other regular mouse has no connectivity issue).
1,Bought the mouse was happy like hell.Received it day after some buttons from the side wasnt working or was working if i pressed very hard on it.Thaslt was my 3rd mouse so far and the worse one.I refunded the mouse and bought somethings else.Gg razer stop promoting and start making good product again.
5,Got this for my 17 year old boy on his Bday. He says he likes it but says it does take a while to get use to it compared to regular mouse. He says it helps with his gaming and he likes it the more he uses it.
1,I have gone through two of these in a year the switches in the left and right click buttons have failed both times. I am currently using an older model naga that still works. Avoid this model until Razer decides to use better parts.
2,Mouse seems to work fine. It's big so if you have small hands it doesn't work for you. Mine came in a bag from Amazon with no bubble wrap or protection the box was damaged and looked crushed on a corner. Not impressed. Might return soon.
1,The customisation app hasnt worked since 2018 so you’re basically buying a normal mouse. Nothing works no macro no led customisation.
1,I would've given it a far better review BUT the mouse has a very annoying issue. It double clicks a lot even if I only pressed the mouse button once. I've gotten around this issue by using one of the macro keys as the mouse click but it's still really annoying.
5,It is amazing ! It looks nice and feels comfortable. We have to install a small software which is pretty easy to use and that’s about it ! I play a lot of World of Warcraft and I can say it makes my game easy with the 12 buttons but I also play some call of duty so I quick switch for the 2 buttons and I’m not missing my shot ! I would recommend it !
4,La verdad es un excelente periférico tanto para gaming como para creadores en lo personal lo uso con shortcuts para desarrollar y me facilita muchas cosas pero considero que su costo es elevado para un uso promedio la verdad vale mucho la pena pero para aquellos que usarán todo su potencial
2,Some of the buttons stopped working after maybe 50 hours of total use.When I shut my PC down for the night when I come back some of the keys on the side don't work I have to press hard and they come back to life. It's weird but the mouse does work fine so long as I remember to click down on those buttons
1,El producto es muy caro para la calidad del dispositovo padece del doble click izquiero con suma facilidad estoy viendo temas de garantía y se tardan demasiado tiempo en poder brindar la atención correspondiente.
1,Not worth it for price.  It died in under 6 months. Not playing professionally. Just my league of legends. Just ridiculous
3,Todo iba muy bien cuando lo compré pero solo tardó 4 meses para que despues comenzara a presentar problemas con el clic izquierdo no me permite arrastrar objetos y leyendo las opiniones de los demas compradores me doy cuenta que no soy el unico con ese problema. En vano gasté tanto por este mouse.
5,Souris que j’adore! Excellent rapport qualité/prix et logiciel de razer qui le supporte à merveille. Les 3 modes sont vraiment cool à utiliser. Très bien pensé!
1,Worked for a few months then the left click started to malfunction. It would click multiple times and keep toggling on/off while pressed making it impossible to drag anything. Tried to clean the inside and it did nothing.
4,Was able to grab this mouse when they still had it on sale. It's feels great to use and I love how you have options with the 3 interchangeable sides.When I got the package the box was a little bit damaged but not to an extreme amount. My only issue so far with this mouse is the scroll wheel doesn't turn smoothly while scrolling. It feels "bumpy" or like it's sticking not sure if this is normal for this mouse.
5,Un peu petite pour la main mais pour le reste très bon.Si vous avez besoin de beaucoup de bouton elle est idéal
1,Keep in mind when making this purchase that you're going to spend hours trouble shooting the software in order to set up keybinds. I recommend if you absolutely HAVE to buy a mouse from this "company" that you get familiar with third party mouse set up options like Mouse-X and the like.
1,This mouse is terrible. Its my second naga. Forst one was one of the old models lasted a good 3 years of intense wow gaming hours. I absolutely loved it and can't play wow without it. But with normal wear and tear after 3 years it started to be buggy and I had to replace it. Bought the trinity on jan 23rd it is now broken as of april 22nd. This is unacceptable Razer products have had a significant drop in quality since they became mainstream manufactured crap like it is now. My friend has the same problem (very inconsistent and broken left click) after 4 months of use. Do not buy terrible cheao overpriced crap. Get the logitech g600 for better comfort and quality for 1/3 of the price. Also I have contacted razer support and after 5 days still no answer. Do not buy I repeat  DO NOT BUY
5,ok great mouse the only think i feel is not the best is when i want to pick up the mouse to move it and with the one 12 button piece i always end up pressing some buttons but that might be because i haven't used it enough and that is a minor think compared to it's overall quality overall 9.5/10
5,Además de jugar también sirve en software de edición ya que tiene botones programables que permiten tener combinaciones (ctrl + s) por dar un ejemploTambién sirve para programación ya que también se le puede programar textoAl tener iluminación se llega a calentar el mouse
5,Es el. Mejor mouse que he tenido hasta ahorita pensé que se dañaría la parte de las caratulas por cambiarlas seguido pero no llevo unos cuantos meses con el y no me ha dado ni un problema además de ser muy cómodo
1,Intermittent and double left clicking after only 4 months of use. Completely unusable.Based on all the negative reviews this is a major flaw with this mouse.Shame on Razer for using cheap switches.Never buying Razer again.
1,Always a gamble when you a buy a Razer product. In my case the mouse didn't work out of the box. Can't say I'm all that surprised but it still hurts given the price of the product.
5,I've been using the Naga series for years and I can't imagine using any other mouse! Minor improvements over the 2014 version. Ergonomically it's better and the buttons are easier to find.
5,I don't think I could do mmo's without the thumb buttons anymore. But now it comes with adaptatable pieces if I decided I wanted to go with less or more. Fast delivery. Great product
5,Its my boyfriends favorite brand for gaming equipment and he loves it alot he uses it for wow and a bunch of other games sometimes i borrow it lol
5,I’m surprised to see the many dislikes. I’ve use this mouse for a while and although I think the side buttons can be bigger for easy pressing that’s the only thing I can realistically complain. The weight is good and the mouse feels very solid. I would recommend.
5,This is my third mouse from the evolution of the original Naga and have been using them for ages. The interchangeable plates are great and love the moba plate for building in fortnite and the OG 12 button plate for WoW. Simply the best designed and high performing thumb-button mouse out there
5,As usual you can never go wrong with a Razer product. Very easy to change side panel for you different games. Bought it for my girlfriend and she love all the color choice but find it a bit big for her hand (she has small hand)
4,My favourite Mouse. I love the interchangeable sides for my games. Pieces are sturdy and connect to mouse easily and securely. Would recommend to anyone even interested in this mouse
5,This was an absolute game changer for World of Warcraft and other similar mmo’s. The 12 button attachment is my favourite one.
1,The left mouse click started to fail after about 1 year of use.  I had a Razer Naga Hex for over 7 years previously.Don't buy Razer their bloatware software HAS to be on CONSTANTLY in order for your mouse to fully function. The defective mouse was the last straw for me.
1,Los botones laterales dejan de funcionar constantemente  al parecer hay un problema con los imanes de la poca. No recomiendo para juegos donde se usan bastante esos botones laterales.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Yo tenía el razer naga 2014 y le tocó jubilarse está muy bies este reemplazo muy cómodo y fácil de configurar
5,Had the old Razer to replace.  These side buttons are the best.  if you fat thumb hits to buttons to much change the side :) Start training your thumb to be the best thing that happened to a hand.
1,Got this mouse and after 6 months the left mouse button started double clicking. Jumped through many hoops with Razer customer service and finally had it replaced. Same issue. It was the last straw for me when it comes to Razer products and I will not be buying from them again.
5,Si quieres tener el mejor mouse para aventurarte en juegos MMO MOBAS MMORPG y en especial FPS para matar a todos los niños mecos que encuentres este mouse debes elegir increible precisión al apuntar efecto chroma muy bueno y en especial anti niños rata
5,Love to feel and fit of this mouse In my handThe interchangeable sideplates have been a game changer for me as I was considering buying multiple different mice at first so I could have different set ups for switching between game types.The three set up options available on this mouse made that a non issue as I can switch out the button set ups as easily as I can switch games now.
1,Compre este mouse porque pense que seria un buen mouse y muy duradero sin embargo los botones de la parte de la izquierda dejaron de funcionar los botones 2 3 y 7 simplemente dejaron de funcionar se supone que es una gama muy alta pero en realidad se descompone con bastante rapidez
5,The size and shape fits well I have bigger hands and don't find any really fit that because it wouldn't work for most. Lol. The extra buttons etc work like a dream.  Will never game without it
4,Update) 1 month into use - I I still find this mouse very comfortable but coming from Logitech I accidentally hit the scroll wheel while gaming and it switches my weapons on me. Hard to get used to.
1,after 3 months my left click can't stick half the time. so its useless in any shooter game and its a painful to click and drag most of the time. it has a nice shinny light effect and alot macro option but it won't help you if you can't use the mice.
5,Esto es el producto con mas calidad y precio es super chingon 10/10 en tiempo y forma
5,interchangeable plates with different customizable buttons for each button makes this mouse very versatile.only issue I have with it is that it takes a while to get used to and it's very easy to hit the wrong button on the side by accident.
5,If you got a massive hand this is a great mouse to get. I love it. Never had any issues with it unlike a lot of other reviews. I've never actually had a problem with any razor product.
4,I bought this mouse because it is compatible for the mac.  The mouse is compatible with my mac but I had to set the sensitivity down quite a bit as it was very very sensitive.  All in all a good purchase but gaming on the mac can be a little subpar ;)
3,el periférico se calienta un poco pero es lo suficiente para hacer que sude la mano lo cual jamás me había pasado antes con otro mouse es bastante molesto fuera de ese detalle lo demas esta perfecto.
3,I can't say anything about this product as it was a Christmas gift.
5,Good dpi the swap out functionality of the buttons is great if you play a variety of games shooters to MMOs. I have large hands and find this mouse comfortable.
2,It's poor quality compared to the 2014 naga and the software loves to crash/refuse to connect to the mouse. The mouse wheel itself shakes and rattles around as does the 12 side button pannel.
5,Me gustan mucho los artículos razer no solo por su utilidad sino la durabilidad que tienen y la confianza que puedo tener en estos periféricos por mucho lo recomiendo y espero que todos estén muy contentos con estos mouse.
5,2nd one first lasted 11 years of hard gaming before any issues.
5,Love it so far no issues while gaming was worth the money.
1,If I could give this mouse a zero I would. Only have had it for a few months and the left click is broken and constantly double-clicks. Googled it and apparently this is a common bug. Save yourself some frustration and avoid this piece of garbage.
5,I had the razor 12 button mouse and love this one since I can flip from one type to the next.And of course it being Razor the quality is a give in.
4,Mouse is awesome almost everything razer is. The bad though: the box came damaged but it could have been a shipping issue. Other than that I have no issues with the mouse. I originally used a razer Naga hex and this has been the best upgrade I've had
5,So far I’m quite enjoying this new mouse. Previous versions of the “naga” have had terrible tracking issues but so far (fingers crossed) this mouse doesn’t have that.  Only drawback I’d say is that it’s not the most comfortable mouse to use for hours on end. Still a great mouse though. 9/10
5,Lo utilizo para edición y gaming. Es cómodo y funciona perfecto.
1,Only used for a month now a button doesn't click unless I press really hard
5,Mon mari travaille dans le domaine du jeux vidéo il adore sa souris
1,When holding down right and left mouse button to move my character I would randomly stop moving even though i did not release my fingers from both mouse buttons. very frustrating in the middle of gaming.
4,Bought for my nephew for gaming.  He loves it.
5,My son will use nothing else !!
3,El botón del número 2 no funciona adecuadamente.Actualización: me hicieron la devolución de inemdiato y el mouse funciona perfectamente es un mouse de gustos y depende el agarre que tenga cada quien a mí me encanta.
3,There's a lot of good about this mouse. The buttons all work and click evenly the magnetic swappable side plates pop on super easily Plus the 'shelf' on the right side for my pinky makes it a very comfortable mouse to hold.My complaint is with the layouts of the thumb buttons. The 12-button numpad and the 7-button 'Hex' aren't very comfortable or intuitive in my opinion. I find there isn't a comfortable spot to rest my thumb without accidentally pressing buttons.With the 12-button option the lowest row of buttons (1 4 7 10) required my thumb to be rubbing against my desk surface to press them. Also the fact that it's an even symmetrical array of buttons with only a slightly varied angle on every other row makes it difficult to quickly locate a specific key to press without feeling around first.The 7-button panel from the 'Hex' mouse is a bit easier to navigate because of the circular layout but still the evenness of the buttons makes it a bit unintuitive in my opinion to quickly select a key to press. And although there's a rubbery surface in the middle of the ring of buttons the whole thing is too far back on the mouse for me to comfortably rest my thumb there without awkwardly forming a nearly 90 degree angle on my thumb knuckle. If this layout were more oval shaped I think that would've made it a lot more appealing.Finally the 2-button panel is pretty straight forward It's fine for FPS games or just regular use. It's the most comfortable one but obviously not the main reason you'd be buying this mouse.In summary the software and ease of use for switching side plates is really cleverly engineered and easy to use. It's very comfortable if you don't mind accidentally pressing all sorts of buttons or using the basic 2-button panel. I'd like to see this sort of technology used with better designed button layouts. If Razer would release other types of side panels sold separately that could be really cool.After owning this mouse for a month or so I went and bought the much cheaper Logitech G602. which has fewer total buttons but a very comfortable groove for your thumb to sit and buttons which are more easily distinguishable by feel. Also it's wireless which is nice. I should mention I bought these mice mainly for use with World of Warcraft in which having lots of buttons quickly at hand is useful. Your mileage in other types of games may vary.
5,Plays really well. The program settings is straight forward and the color chroma is really nice with the flame lighting.
3,The mouse start double clicking after a year... very disapointed
5,It’s nice to have the 3 plate. But realistically speaking u aren’t gonna be doing a lot of switching. I wish they just sold each separately.
5,Compré este modelo para sustituir un Chrome Epic. La mejoría y la versatilidad es enorme. Un mismo mouse para gente que jugamos sin intención de ser profesionales que sirva tanto para un RPG como un FPS es súper útil.
5,Producto tal como estaba especificado entrega rápida gracias.recomiendo el producto llego a tiempo a la puerta de mi casa .
5,Love it wise i would have got one a while ago
1,Después de un mes de uso comenzó a fallar y no hay forma de hacer valida la garantía desde México. He comprado dos de estos dispositivos y los dos han fallado igual.
5,Im not a gamer.. Like sub casual.Im using mine for general work & video/ audio editing.
5,Husband loves this product
5,This mouse is da bomb. Haha for real i love it it feels so natural and ergonomic and the macros are life saver. The side button is a game changer and the fact that you can adapt it to the games you play is perfect !
5,Las placas intercambiables son muy cómodas y el mouse es muy bueno. Mis únicos dos inconvenientes son que el scroll para mi gusto es malo (es muy duro y con pasos muy grandes) y al ponerlo en una superficie plana se tambalea un poco sobre un tapete esta bien.
1,Still testing the mouse hopefully it works fine. But the pictures speaks for itself packaging was definitely opened mouse looks like someone mailed returned goods to amazon.
5,Had the razor naga before but after many months of gaming a couple of the buttons stopped working I probably just reached the push limit because I play a lot. So I bought the naga trinity for the extra layouts same mouse works great super comfortable for a bigger hand
5,Pouer les gamers  je vous les recommande
1,Past 4-5 years I had 2 orbweavers 2-3 years each they were great! Got this one and after 2 months it stared giving me issues and not registering left clicks... garbage
5,So far this mouse has served as a top notch replacement to my well used 2012 Razor Naga.
5,I bought this thinking wow I love the 7 macro circle attachment. Tried that one and I hate it throw on the 12 macro piece and it's amazing. So glad I am able to just effortlessly swap between them.
5,Très bonne souris comme toute les razers que j'ai eu dans le passé . Seul petit ik  souris un peu plus grosse que celle que j'avais avant donc y va avoir un temps d'adaptation .
5,Buena relación calidad-precio funcionan a la perfección y se ajustan a lo que necesitaba
5,Just what I am looking for!
5,Different side button pieces pop on and off easily when wanted But hasn't come off in gameplay. Works really well for MMO games.
5,Tem uma boa pegada porém achei um pouco resistente ao mousepad rígido da corsair mas vai de se adaptar com o tempo.
3,Unfortunately Razer’s latest drivers do not work with Mac OS and so I’m unable to use my mouse to its fullest capabilities.If this were fixed easily the perfect MMO mouse.
4,Overall I enjoy using the mouse. I would recommend buying a larger mouse if you have big hands. Short & fat profile.
5,Very pro gamer skill required to be good at using this mouse!!
5,Esta excelente el mouse tuve el Naga Chroma Epic y este no le pide nada  sacrifique lo inalámbrico por la comodidad entre los diferentes juegos . Lo Amé!
1,has no physical damage just doesnt let you draw or use tools like snippet as it unclicks it self while holding downgarbage mouse 10/10 would not buy again
5,Awesome I love it
5,Bought this mouse for streaming.  the 12 buttons work well with changing scenes and playing sound files
5,Really comfortable to handle. The left side ''panel'' is easy to switch. And I like the fact  that you can change the brithness of the RGB lights.
5,Come from a Corsair Scimitar that had numerous problems not as heavy as the Corsair but love it so far.
5,I didn't know if I was going to like this or not when I bought it but I really like it.
5,no estaba decidido cual mouse comprar y el razer trinity es la mejor opcion porque puedo cambiar de botones de acuerdo a las necesidades.
1,Product arrived opened  used and abused. Was supposed to be new. I can guarantee someone swapped the new mouse with their old one then returned.
5,Item as described good purchase.
1,300MB worth of garbage software which is required to actually make use of the mouse features just won't work!
5,Husband likes it very much.
5,Really like this mouse. Gotta get used to holding it without mashing all the side buttons but it's made my gaming experience a lot easier overall :)
4,Without the mouse shift that my old g600 had  this mouse has much less options with hotkeys.I should of stuck with a new g600
5,Always love racer products had a Naga epic for years that finally broke down and bought this one to replace it
5,Es un muy buen producto un poco incomodo por la parte del lugar para poner el pulgar o quiza aun no me haya adaptado pero de ahi en fuera es muy bueno y rapido
5,I love it!
5,Super happy with this purchase works great love the customization with 2buttons 7 buttons and 12 buttons
4,So one day I was using this mouse when all of a sudden the side buttons and leds stoped working to fix this I pushed up really hard on the side button panel and it worked. Aside from that it’s a good mouse
5,Very good feel good and worth recommending
5,Excelente mouse para juegos lo encontré a un súper precio en el buen fin!
5,exelente mause original en caja selladalo malo es que lo envian dentro de un sobre y la caja llego un poco golpeada
5,Definitely recommend to anyone wanting a good gaming mouse.  Love the RGB lighting!!!
5,Amazing mouse for gaming would recommend to anyone who needs a top of the line mouse for gaming.
5,Everything works awesome!  Buttons have quick response. Very easy and fast to change out button plates.
2,Used the mouse for the first month fine but have been having issues with both the right and left click ever since. I've had the mouse just 7 months and I'm already replacing it.
5,It's just a great mouse! Could not be happier.
5,SuperLivraison rapide
4,Best mouse I've used when it works... left click stopped working after only 8 months.
5,I've been rocking the Naga Molten for 8 years and I just upgraded for the Naga Trinity. I absolutely love the 12 buttons on the side so practical for gaming !
5,En mi opinión es el mejor mause que he probado nunca me dio fallas estoy realmente sorprendido por la calidad  de este mause simplemente hermoso
5,Very happy with this mouse.
5,A good gaming mouse. Easy to program the buttons. Fits well in my hand and has a good weight
1,It now clicks about 1000 times per second and is completely unusable for even regular use. I was very careful with it.
5,Bonne qualité
5,How was surprised how well the mouse worked! I thought it would be difficult to put on the the different buttons  or it wouldn’t Ben comfortable. But it was amazing!
5,Exceptional gaming mouse with the ability to change the side buttons. Love that!
5,Excelente producto nuevo y muy fácil de usar reacciona increible de los mejores mouse gamer que puede haber
5,Wait for it to go on sale.I think they go up to 30% off if you keep an eye on it on various websites.
5,I'll never use another mouse ever again. I LOVE this mouse!
4,Estoy feliz con mi compra el único desperfecto que le encuentro es que en ocasiones se desconfiguran los botones ☹️Pero por lo demás es muy cómodo y bonito
4,Esta bueno pero medio mal hecho mada que ver con modelos anteriores
5,really good for my kind of games! RPG
5,my son loves it
5,Great light weight MMO mouse. Definitely feel a difference vs the trinity or scimitar.
5,Everything I was looking for.
5,Justo lo que esperaba ya tuve uno modelo 2012 y apenas se descompuso excelente para jugar wow
1,I found the mouse useful for playing games but the issue is the sensor broke so fast if a little bit of dust gets into it.
4,Overall good product but seems far to easy to misclick the side buttons
5,this is single handedly the best mouse i have ever used the versatility is endless and it is super easy to switch out side plates to give you different mouse conifgs for gaming.
5,The Trinity is very versatile...
5,Super smooth so many buttons to program  excellent for gaming  highly recommend
5,A mouse that is really useful for MMO. Never regret getting it and loving it now.
5,He visto comentarios malos y buenos. Yo esperare unos meses para decirles si si combine  o no.
3,The software a little bit buggy for it but works well when it’s not glitching.
5,Very comfortable and fast!
5,El mejor mouse que he usado hasta la fecha.
1,I have the Razer Naga which looks identical to this mouse other than it's wired or wireless and can't change from the 12 buttons on the left.  The scroll wheel is super smooth as is the mouse.  This one is not the same at all.  The scroll wheel clicks basically so not a smooth scroll but one where it feels like gears where as you rotate it it goes click click click like notches vs being smooth.  It also uses a different version of Synapse than the one I have which constantly logs out or loses the configuration of the device.  It's an okay mouse but if you already have the Razer Naga and are getting a 2nd or replacing it just be aware that the quality has gone down big time.Edit: I'm changing my review to 1 star as this mouse has gotten worse.  First it only works if you have an internet connection.  Yes you read that correctly.  The mouse "works" without one but it goes SO fast you can't even use it.  So you need Razer Synapse software running but if you don't have an internet connection Synapse logs you out and can't manage the mouse.  Synapse is what takes over the system preferences to control the mouse speed and settings so it's stupid it needs internet to work!  Also every so often especially after your computer has been sleeping the mouse will revert to being so fast you can't use it.  So you either have to restart Synapse or reboot your computer.Edit 2: 6 months in just gets worse and worse.  Synapse logs you out every single time your Mac goes to sleep.  You log in and it says you have no profiles.  I'm literally rebooting 5 times a day just to use this stupid thing.
5,super mon fils est content
5,Très bonne souris pour jouer
5,i love he feel of this mouse the extra buttons on the side are of great use also.
5,LOVE IT!! I use this mouse for many games and the side buttons switch makes every game special on its own.
5,Incredible quality!
5,Was for the kid and he's happy with it.
5,Es el mejor mouse que existe en el mundo compraré otro para cuando el que tengo ya no sirva y ya no lo vendan. Llevo un año usándolo diario para programación y edición. No tiene fallas hay que cuidarlo del polvo y suciedad (obvio). Absolutamente lo mejor en mouse.

5,Awesome product
5,Good
5,Excelente
5,Excellent mouse! Endless options comfortable!
5,Un excellent produit
4,The circle keys are good. But the paint is starting to ware off. I dont use the mmo 12 key any more. And the 2 button is the best for comfort.
4,Really wish the circular one had an even number of buttons because it’s very awkward with The 7 buttons on it. would have been better with 6 or 8 cause then the buttons all have an opposite button.
2,I think I'm the problem not this mouse. Every time I re-buy the Naga I know it'll only last 2 or so years and then for whatever reason I'm back to re-buying the mouse after it stops working. If I didn't have all my keys bound to my favourite games on the side buttons I'd ditch this mouse like no tomorrow. If you're shopping for a mouse know that you'll fall in love with this mouse and then you'll be stuck re-buying it every few years.TL;DR The right button stopped working and I'm re-buying a naga mouse for the third time in six years.
1,Empezó a fallar después del mes de compra tiene fallas el click izquierdo no puedo hacer "drag" las cosas sin que se suelte y esto hace imposible de usarlo en diversos juegos.Lo compré después de muchos años de usar el Razer Epic Naga el cual quise reemplazar por uno igual pero no lo encontré en existencia pensé que sería un buen reemplazo pero no lo fue el mouse es demasiado ancho aún y cuando tengo manos grandes se siente muy diferente al anterior. Se cerró la ventana de devolución y pues ahora tendré que comprar otro.
2,I've owned two razer mice. This one and the older green model. After a year of use with both of them the left and right clicks begin to stop functioning correctly. This causes doubleclicks or not registering a click at all. I don't recommend their mice! It's unfortunate because I really love this mouse and would rate it 5 stars IF it lasted longer than 1 year.
1,I've always been an advocate of Razer products. I've had multiple Razer mice and i've loved the Naga Hex V2 which i had for around 2 years. When my Hex mouse started having click issues i changed it for a Naga Trinity because it included the Hex model side panel with 7 buttons. The concept of the mouse with the side panel is amazing. This mouse is in theory the perfect mouse for my use and the 7 buttons side scheme is unique.However...The first thing i noticed when i installed it was how this model felt much cheaper the buttons felt loose the plastic felt much lighter than my previous model and somehow i felt like it wouldn't last.Less than 3 months laster the left click started acting on me and i couldn't drag items / windows anymore because it would stop holding the left click midway. The side buttons felt looser and the left click issue itself made it impossible to keep using it.I considered getting the Hex V2 again. This model was of much better quality. Yet it isn't produced or at least marketed anymore. It was basically replaced by this cheap version with the 3 side panels.So i'm officially done with Razer products starting now. This mouse was in theory perfect yet it ended up being a complete waste of money.
3,tenho ele o atomic da gorila e o que usava antes era o impact da redragon ele é o pior com certeza. Mas leve e aparentemente mais frágil.
1,I had this mouse for about a year before it started having problems.  The mouse lights up bright looks and feels nice and moves smoothly.  However the left mouse button will sporadically either only send one input or will suddenly stop sending signals so I'll be firing a gun and it just suddenly stops firing or it just fires one bullet.  I tried blowing air into it thinking dust might be messing with it that didn't help.So I tried contacting support thinking that since it was well within warranty I could get a replacement no problem.  Boy was I wrong.  I dealt with some of the absolute worst customer service ever.  They demand I record a video of me using the mouse while also capture game footage of the problem occurring.  I tried explaining to them that it's just not possible due to it happening SPORADICALLY without any warning and my set up just doesn't allow me to capture my monitor and my mouse at the same time.  They wouldn't budge they said they had to have that footage for me to get a replacement.  I tried showing a short clip of it happening but couldn't record my mouse at the same time so they said I had to re-record and have my mouse in the shot.I gave up arguing due to how futile it was as they refused to listen to any sort of reason and told them to just forget about it.  Then they had the nerve to be condescending and reply saying "we know you can do it!" .  I've just given up and accepted I won't get a replacement despite it being under warranty.  The mouse also had an imperfection where the back part of the attachable side piece is a bit smaller than the other half which causes a bit of scratching to happen.  They said small problems like that aren't covered under warranty (: .So yeh avoid this mouse and this company as a whole awful low quality products mixed with the absolute worst customer service gives you a headache and wasted money.  Save your money buy a less expensive higher quality product with significantly better customer service from Logitech Corsair etc.  Razer says "For Gamers By Gamers" when they truly mean "Forget Gamers Because Money" .
1,Bought one lasted 6 months of moderate use bought another died in 6 months of maybe 1 hour per week of usage.  Starts double clicking and not clicking. Garbage build.
1,Worked at first and was nice but two months later and minimal use it’s now not being detected on any computer i try it on.  Amazon 30 day return window closed.  It was a nice mouse while it lasted but I’m forced to give 1/5 because now I have to buy a new one…
1,I bought this mouse based on the recommendation a fellow gamer. The mouse itself is physically nice to use. However Razar's software is rude. To access their mouse centre software to actually benefit from the mouse you MUST create a Razer account and accept their software which you then must allow Razer to spy on you and report back to Razer including all of your online actions. That has nothing to do with the mouse and should not be required.
4,Honeslty it’s high quality and should be for the price. But the feeling is odd it’s not the normal shape for a mouse.If your a person who is into micro keys for editing or MMOs then yes you will probably love it and you will learn how to hold it as it does get comfortable after a while. But for the average gamer.. I can really justify the price tag. But it’s still well built and super functional
1,The side buttons stopped working within 2 months of purchase which surprisingly was just outside the return window
4,ich hatte bereits den vorgänger die Razer Naga 2014 und war mit der schon zufrieden aber die Trinity topt das! so viele möglichkeiten! super maus für MMOs/RPGs. wie ich finde stimmt der preis im verhältnis zur leistung. habe den kauf nicht bereut :)
5,Einfach  nur top
5,Sie liegt besser in der Hand als meine alte Naga und endlich kann ich auch andere Spiele zocken außer DOTA2. Mausrad ist ein bisschen schwerläufig aber ich habe mich daran gewöhnt. Ich benutze nur 2 der 3 aufsetze aber das reicht mir schon. Ich liebe diese Maus ->5 StarsPS: Ich habe die Maus für 65 Euro im Blitzangebot gekauft aber ich würde auch 80€ bezahlen. Mehr ist sie nicht Wert.
1,Issues started on day one the swappable plates need to be reconnected multiple times for all buttons to register. The software is bloated and cumbersome. Not only does it require you to create a Razer account just to use it randomly decides to reset your DPI settings every so often right in the middle of working. For such a premium mouse the plastic feels astoundingly cheap and creaky. About a year after purchase it started developing an issue where it would register single clicks as two clicks as well as releasing a held click when you have kept it held and it has just gotten steadily worse since to the point where I am now replacing this (at the time £100) "premium" mouse after relatively little use. I have concluded that Razer is a trash brand and I'll be going back to Logitech.
2,Die Verpackung sieht aus als wäre jemand darauf herumgetrampelt. Vielleicht sollte man sie nicht nur in einen gepolsterten Umschlag stecken sondern in eine ordentliche Kiste. Finde ich echt Mist! Bisher funktioniert sie aber es würde mich nicht wundern wenn beim Transport was kaputt gegangen wäre. Umso schlimmer da die Maus ein Geschenk für meinen Freund sein soll.
4,Sehr gute Verarbeitung angenehme Auflage der Hand.
5,senza dubbio il miglior mouse che abbia mai provato... attenzione è la versione ottico non prendete quello laser perchè vi puo' dar problemi come è successo a me... questo mouse è ideale per giocare a titoli dove servono molti tasti a portata di mano
5,To razor - Thank you for making this. Always great using your products. Well designed and very durable. And the main thing. It fits me like a glove.
1,ich habe mir die Naga Trinity gekauft nachdem meine alte Naga kaputt gegangen ist. Anfangs war ich zufrieden da sie die gleichen Maße und funktionen hat wie die alte. Jedoch funktionieren die linke und rechte Maustasten nicht mehr richtig. Doppelklick links funktioniert oft nicht sowie das halten der rechten Maustaste (springt hin und her als würde man ständig schnell klicken). Zum Spielen am PC ist sie somit unbrauchbar.
1,Synapse 3 is mandatory to use this mouse which gives it the lowest rating possible regardless of how good or bad the mouse is.Regret buying for this reason.
1,Left Click started to double click with in 5 months of use and the mouse wheel is hard to use.
2,J'ai acheter 2 fois cette souris une fois en magasin et une fois ici.La version acheter sur amazon a des marteriaux plus bas de gamme que la version en magasin et sa se voit au toucher.Le pire un default de fabrication a peine visible a l'oeil qui ma obliger de passer un couteaux (exacto/cutter) sous la souris car un morceau de plastique relever venais donner de la resistance en grafignant mon tapis.
5,I owned many gaming mouse over the years (older gamer here) and Razer never disappointed me. It was epiphany to get a trinity as it's customizable depending on your playstyle and games. Sure cheaper gaming mouse will do the trick but they are never as comfortable in the hand and the buttons never as easy to find. Get a Razer Trinity mouse you'll thank me if you never owned Razer products before.
5,Mouse preciso e melhor que o naga x. Anteriormente comprei o naga x e tive problema após 4 meses de uso. Naga trinity é consideravelmente mais pesado e o cabo não é o speedflex porém mouse tem um acabamento muito superior.  Extremamente satisfeito.
5,Ya no funciona el botón 1 del módulo de 12 teclas 2 meses y ya no sirve...
1,Comfortable mouse but the quality is absolutely terrible. Since day one the attachments constantly disconnect and mid game you will die and find out your mouse buttons aren't working. Then you have to reconnect the attachments and hope that it doesn't screw you up in an important situation. I repeat stay away from this mouse.
5,don't need to say much. i use it for work & gaming and it's been awesome
1,The mouse stopped working after 2 weeks. Tried to troubleshoot it with Razer Support but they ended up telling me to return it saying it was a hardware issue.
5,Perfect for LoL.
1,Comme beaucoup de gens disent cette souris est geniale.... mais c'est comme un condom!!!! Tu l'utilise et c'est fini après fail... fail... fail... les boutons font des doubles click en moins d'un an donc RMA et là Razer demande la total...faut faire 400 tests... facture video pour prouver le problème et je te dit pas tout le processus du renvoi qui est le plus compliqué que j'ai eu a faire....... Ils finissent par la changer mais c'est vraiment désagréable.... J'ai aussi un tartasus....la même chose. Faite des recherches sur les moteurs de recherche Razer a perdu la moitié de sa valeur en bourse à cause de la piètre qualité de ses produits. Aller vers corsair logitech ou autre... ou faite comme moi... poste de soudure et des pièces de rechange de meilleures qualitées à utiliser après garanti....
5,Mouse chegou perfeito e é excelente. Recomendo.
2,For the price you would expect the mechanism that senses clicks not to break after 2 months....
1,Primero estaba bien luego deja de funcionar o da dobles clicks. Contacté a Razer y me pidieron hacer miles de pruebas documentadas y al mandárselas me dijeron que si quiero que me hagan válida la garantía que debo tener un amigo o familiar en Estados Unidos para que tramiten lo del Return Merchandise Authorization y aparte tengo que pagar el envío del producto fallido y del nuevo que me mandarían...
5,Llevo 6 meses con este mouse y la verdad es muy cómodo preciso y ergonómico excelente compra.
5,El mouse es muy práctico
1,Weighting is wrong sized for children bloatware drivers with lots of bells and whistles but can't do the basics right.
5,Bought this as a gift for my dad at Christmas and he loves it. He uses it all the time now.
1,Originally I had a razer naga.Less than 1 year it started having an issue intermittently not transmitting the signal when moving mouse.I had a warranty on it so they replaced it.One year later guess what the buttons stop working intermittently. Still under warranty. Ask them to replace it they said they can't because it's already been replaced once.So ok I say what ever bad luck. Go buy a brand new razer trinity in march. Now it's January (11months) and the buttons are intermittently not working.Not only that I had a tartarus gaming pad that I loved as well. Also had TONS of issues with it. FANTASTIC PRODUCT IF ONLY IT WORKED.F YOU RAZER STOP MAKING GARBAGE I WILL NEVER BUY YOUR CRAP AGAIN! DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS ME. Trust me I am not even hard on these products. They just SUCK.
4,Good but the 12 side buttons are ultra sensitive
5,parfait pour gamer soit des jeux FPS ou MPORG peux importe elle est parfaite
4,livraison tres rapidetres satisfait a dateen jeux dans WOW va tres bien .
4,Upgraded from the Naga Trinity. This mouse has everything you need. Very versatile and comfortable. Bluetooth and 2.4 g works great. I highly recommend. Loses 1 star because it doesn't come with the charging dock and the price is pretty outrageous. If you can afford it without breaking the bank I say go for it.
1,Super well built BUT way to big and too high for comfort.  There are less expensive products out there that are simply better.  DO NOT WASTE you hard-earned money on these.  From my experience (Keyboard and now Mouse) Razer is nothing but a hype.  You're paying to look cool not to get your money's worth.  I will no longer be a client of that company.
1,Beware of this software. Every time I run the software to get maximum use from the mouse it disconnects me from the network. basically I have bought a way overpriced mouse with features I can't use.Highly recommend against purchasing this product.
1,Me entregaron el mouse el 8 de agosto y el 1 de noviembre dejó de funcionar.
5,Me encanto el mouse lo uso para jugar World of Warcraft lo compre en descuento. Comprado y enviado por Amazon México.
5,I run Manjaro Linux and had a hard time getting the buttons to remap to custom keys but there are some good open source options on GitHub.I play Dota2 and CS Go. Really like the ability to switch between one mount for MOBAs and another for shooters.Good build quality and comfortable.
1,this mouse hasnt worked since we got it and there is no way to contact the purchases on amazon there is not even seller feedback pretty hard to get an item returnedno one to contact before expiry after purchase the mouse is crap doesnt work and amazon makes it impossible to leave feedback to seller.  so no body can get their money back or return it
1,Title
3,Unfortunately the mouse was a bit smaller than I expected and not quite comfortable in my hand however the real deal breaker was the wheel. I had seen some reviews mentioning it but the wheel felt rough and wobbly and really not matching the quality of the rest of the mouse.
5,Tout simplement Wow !
4,Great mouse but can get a bit warm. Not the best when already playing a sweaty game. But miles better than my last mouse over all.
5,No 1
5,I use this mouse every day for gaming. My hand never feels off after hours of gaming. If this mouse ever breaks I'd definitely be buying another.
1,I purchased this mouse in hopes to replace my broken naga chroma. After purchasing I realized that it wasn’t the same mouse. As it is missing the scroll wheel tilt buttons and one button on the top. I figured I could work around it but after realizing the quality isn’t good the mouse buttons feel lower quality despite being roughly the same price. I don’t understand why this mouse exists in the same world as the Naga chroma.
1,I thought i would update my logitech mouse and decided to go all razer to match gamepad and keyboard. That way i could run all my games through Synapse. The mouse appeared nice enough and loved the interchangeable buttons. However during FPS games i was getting hitching and skipping and just dead spots when in battles with other players. At first i just thought the timing was coincidence so reinstalled games changed settings and even did a complete reinstall of my system thinking it was lag or dropped packets. It was so bad i just gave up gaming for a bit. Tried playing again and it was bad enough i threw the mouse. So switched back to my old logitech and all the problems disappeared. Researched this mouse and found i wasnt the only one with the problem. Has something to do with Synapse but non of the fixes worked for me. Sticking with logitech as this mouse was absolute garbage.
4,I would give this thing 5 stars as I love the naga line but this one i have had issues with the plate buttons.Every so often the buttons on the side do not work. With a little wiggling on the side it will start working again.Pain at times but i'll survive
5,This is exactly what I needed. Switching the buttons is great however keep in mind they are hotkeys they are not extra buttons like mouse 4 or 5.While it works great and is comfortable enough it is a little heavier than I would like for fps games compared to my deathadder. But if you need the buttons this can be modified quickly. Really cool.
1,Like most reviewers I also thought Razer was a trusted brand and at the time purchased this mouse May 2020 for $130.This mouse worked excellent for the 1st 3 months after that it started acting up. After Googling some common issues with the mouse and hearing from other friends/family who have also purchased the same mouse encountered the same issue.Main issue: LMB/RMB multi-double/triple clicking behavior on a single press. While normally using for browsing navigating or gaming you'll encounter mouse click issues like where it's stuck but in fact it's malfunctioning and clicking many times on a single press. Spoke with 3 different Razor support staff and they tried very hard not to RMA the mouse asking me to re-install Synapse would fix the issue.All my gaming mouses have never had this issue this quickly. Lesson learned from paying for an expensive "supposedly trusted" brand name that didn't last longer than a $30 Logitech/Corsair gaming mouse.
1,Button placement is bad. Unconfortable to push some of the buttons.Razor hypershift functionality only works on razor keyboard so thats a huge middle finger to the consumer. As if its that hard to allow us to map it to another key... Crappy software. Used to be a good brand but they are running it to the ground.Im not buying a new keyboard but I will opt for logitecs mouse with a built in shift key that is half the price next time around.
1,Within a couple months of having this mouse it started double clicking on everything. Looking it up revealed it was a prevalent issue without an easy fix. Put up with it a lot longer than any person should even gave up using it for a time before giving it another go.Nowhere near worth the cost for such poorly made product.
1,Pues muy bonito y todo pero desde el inicio tuvo fallas con el click trate de no darle importancia y seguí jugando pensando que podía mejorar o que me podía adaptar pero ahora en los juegos no mantiene el click y la continuidad en disparos en proyectos no mantiene la selección y se convierte un problema. Muy caro salió esta madre para que ni garantía tenga en su caja y pues solo es tirar el dinero a la basura. Para nada lo recomiendo. Lo peor es que sin garantía pues no hay a quien reclamar o al menos que lo reparen.
1,Ma souris Naga chroma est décédé jai décidé d'acheter ce produit pour la remplacer. le truc qui se sépare (les touches de coté 123 ect) frotte sur le tapis de souris et empêche un bon déplacement libre et le bruit est très agaçant  jai presque le gout de la limer%/""$ ou pire de sauter a 2 pied joint pour l'exploser!!!.  La molette de la souris est tellement cheap comparativement a la chroma et les boutons sur le dessus aussi sont de piètre qualité. Je suis très en colère d'avoir payé ce prix pour ce produit de marde. J'au rais payé 200$ pour une naga chroma de bonne qualité.
1,I bought this mouse as a side mouse to use on the go even bought a carying case to protect it and after a couple use in the lifespan of 4 months the mouse stopped working completely
1,Got this mouse for general use on my secondary laptop.Barely used it over the past year. From start I've noticed issues with double-clicking and dragging windows. Despite minimal use the problem has gotten worst and worst to the point of bordering on unusable.I have not used it for gaming just casual clicking on a barely used laptop so normal wear and tear cannot explain this issue. Looking at online reviews I see this is a common occurrence.It's painful to use this garbage to scroll through a text file. I cannot imagine how you could use it for any game let alone a competitive one.The absolute worst and most expensive mouse purchase I have ever made. Unacceptable in my view. A 15$ mouse will last you far longer and would actually hold a click.Will avoid all Razer products in the future.
2,i bought my naga in 2019 and since then its developed many issues. both mouse buttons double and tripple click and the sensor jumps arround the screen randomly. razer rma is known to be awful so i cant even be asked to deal with them. this is prob considerd normal wear and tear but my 12 key pad is already missing half the black paint and light comes through where it shouldnt and my left click is entirely shiny and smooth lolthe only things i can give it are it withstands when i slam it for jumping arround my screen when i'm trying to do stuff i need perscission for and its a really comfortable mouse to use. i dont know if i can reccomend it since razers gone so far downhill over the years but what hasnt honestly.
5,Perfeito
5,This product is 1000% awesome!! I recommend any and all Razer products! U won’t be disappointed!@TheLazyGamer and Zerodead1_
1,Purchased this mouse. Three buttons on the mouse didn't work. Mouse feels low quality.  Attempted RMA. Razer has ridiculous requirements to proceed with RMA. Such a waste of time for buying such an expensive product.
5,I had exact same mouse from 7 years ago and that was getting old.. so I bount the vewer version of it. I hated the old one's number button but the new one is way better ;)
4,I like all the features it's just abit heavy for a modern mouse. (Same as most mmo mice).I know it's personal preference but I wish it had 9 bigger not 12 small buttons (7 too few lol. (Had that setup on my old modular roccat nyth).I did get used to it though and I use the buttons accurately most of the timeThe lighter weight trend is reaching mmo miceGot it at a discount during offers period so was good value.Still a great mouse for mmo/Dota and other similar games.For FPS just get a cheap wired razer viper or mini instead which I did (if ur sticking with razor). Any decent light weight mouse is better. It's too heavy for that
5,Like many others the left button of my Naga Trinity gave out so I decided to give Naga X a shot. Happy with my purchase. Pretty much plug and play since it used the previous profile though I did have to edit button 4 (the one below the wheel) since unlike the Naga Trinity this one only has one button there. Everything else feels just like the old Naga that I had. Happy with my purchase so far.
1,Absolutely trash garbage mouse. I bought it and like almost all razer mice after a year it completely starts to deteriorate. The left mouse button double clicked or didn't register clicks at all. Save your time and money and do not buy this dumpsterfire razer product. Don't let the rgb fool you on how embarrassing razer merchandise is.
1,So I've been using Razer for my gaming gear for over a decade. Their stuff has gone downhill drastically in the past 3-5 years and this mouse has ended my love of their products.For the price I expect to get YEARS of use. I bought this mouse in September 2019 and after maybe 7 months I started having problems with the left mouse button having to be pressed extremely hard sometimes especially when I first boot up.As I play competitive this is a problem and has cost me games. The Razer Naga I had before this had a problem as well and I got maybe 2 years out of it.I also have their keyboard Ornata Chromata one of my fave keyboards of all time for how it feels but they keys have all worn off from fingernails. The last headset I had before the one I'm using now (HyperX) also didn't have as long of a life as it's predecessors.So this is my last product with Razer. Their quality is failing. I dunno what they've changed - cheaper parts maybe? But their prices should reflect that. Cya Razer.
5,Produto veio em perfeito estado confesso que podem melhorar para a caixa não vir amassada mas excelente e o atendimento também. Obrigado
1,Bought the Naga molten back in the days but it started double clicking about three years in. Disappointing but fine. Hopeful I bought this product to end with the double clicks. Lo and behold this thing degrades into a worse state in a record 3 months and a few days of regular use (3 month warranty :) ).In short: Old version had unreliable Omron switches. This version uses the same. Do not buy. They all crap out eventually and you have to replace the spring/solder a new switch.
3,I loved this mouse for about 1.5 years at which time both the right and left click are starting to fail. I would have hoped to get a lot more use out of it!
5,One of the best gaming nice hands down in the market.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 So i ordered the mouse i got it in yesterday an picked it up from post office today the packaging itself was in a bigger shoe size box an there was a business care inside the box itself called Bass Electronics was in a black garbaged bag taped up with packaging tape covered all around it an when i finally got through layers of tape an a black garbage bag the razer naga trinity box itself look like it got stomped on by Ace Ventura pet detective's. An when i opened it up i looked at the mouse itself it was filthy on the mouse an bottom of the mouse itself. I give this a rating of 1/10 stars i paid for a brand new Mouse not a used mouse.
5,My old razer naga chroma had a problem with 1 of the button so i decide to purchase this mouse and to my surprise is a big improvement! More lightsmallerslide better and the clicking feel more build of quality i am very happy with my purchase
5,Mouse it good got it for girlfriend for her MMO no complains so far
3,I never really had issues with Razer mice even though most other people do but this time it seems I have encountered their bad experiences. A couple of the side buttons seem to suddenly stop working until I remove the side-panel and put it back on. It is a really nice gimmick that I often use to switch between RPGs and FPS games on the fly. However it seems that it is not entirely reliable as it can sometimes get wonky and some of the buttons stop working.Razer still doesn't have their software figured out as Synapse still has annoying bugs such as not running on start-up and changing your mouse profiles (i.e macros DPI and binds) for no reason in the middle of games. The hardware of the mouse still seem average. Not bad but not amazing either. The side panel buttons on my mouse are losing their finish so now the LED lights are leaking through the buttons. The mouse feet also seem to wear out a lot faster than my past Razer mice.
3,The mouse is great on paper. But there are issues with the buttons not triggering when pressed which would require you to remove the side plate and replace for it to function again. The Classic Naga was so much more reliable.
5,Es un mouse grande que se agradece para apoyar toda la mano excelente para MMO y FPS por sus caratulas intercambiables.
5,Agradable al tacto buena respuesta y durabilidad de su batería excelente compra
5,but huge upgrade over the OEM Mouse I had would recommend to anyone
2,This mouse is a terrible gaming mouse it has no weight and the side buttons are too easily clicked and feel slippery. Holding down a charge with them feels awful and i feel like i have no grip with this mouse. the original naga is of higher quality.
1,This item was never exposed to water or any other environmental scenario which could have negatively affected the Mouse. The right click on the mouse died today It was only Purchased in April. Really disappointed for a device that cost over 100$ it should have at least lasted two years. Razer Trinity is such a disappointment.
1,O mouse não é original e não veio com as 3 peças laterais para serem trocadas os botões laterais.
4,The macro fonction isn't as precise as wanted but it's à confortable and precise mouse.Gratuit buy!
4,It's unimaginably great having 12 buttons under your thumb for programming macros or just having the number row there. You don't have to move your hand from WASD to be able to change weapons or heal yourself cuz you can put it all under your thumb. But the buttons are a little on the soft side if you're always picking up your mouse to reposition it you'll probably hit a side button till you get used to it.

5,I got this mainly to replace my Logitech G600 which started having clicking issues and I feel almost right at home with this Naga and with some extras too.I primarily use it for productivity by assigning the side buttons to commonly used system shortcuts such as "Alt-Tab" or "Ctrl-T" and it has significantly improved my productivity as the shortcuts are right at my thumb instead of having to reach across a keyboard. The interchangeable sides are interesting but I mainly use the 12 button one.The mouse as a whole feels well ergonomic with an area for your right ring finger to rest on. The texture is smooth but also has a decent grip so the mouse doesn't slip too much from your hands. The tilting scroll wheel is nice with a fair amount of tactile feedback and its functions are customisable too. I use them to quickly move windows around. Mouse clicks are good too it sounds and feels tactile. RGB lighting is superb and you can set the scroll wheel the logo and the side buttons to different colours. Unfortunately you can't individually set the colours of the side buttons; they're all set together as one.The cable has a nice braid that gives it a good look and feels nice hopefully it doesn't fray like in older products. There is also on-board memory which allows you to store up to 5 profiles on-board and there's a button and an LED light on the bottom of the mouse which allows you to select the different profiles and the LED light indicates which profile you're on.Finally there's the Synapse software to set up the mouse. It's quite an improvement over the previous generation and the biggest benefit is not having to sign-in just to set the colours or assign shortcuts. Setting the RGB lighting is also easy and quite interesting with layered effects. Lots of customisation for the RGB lighting.The only slight issue I have with the mouse is that the 12 buttons can be quite easy to press accidentally especially when gripping the mouse. The Logitech G600 had a higher actuation force and was less prone to these accidental presses.Nonetheless it's still a great mouse whether you're gaming or doing work. I'm glad to see that such mice still exist as it's an incredible productivity booster. And it looks great with the RGB lighting too!
5,je joue à des jeux comme Diablo et j'ai adoré ma nouvelle acquisition
2,The features on the mouse are nice.  I never had an issue with the software either.  The quality of the mouse however is awful.  It feels cheap and in under 2 years of use the right-mouse button has failed.  I don't press very hard because I normally play puzzle games so I'm fairly light on my mice.  I've actually never had a hardware failure on a mouse before even my old MB-2000 that I had for almost a decade.  I do no recommend the purchase of this product.
2,I get that things break down over time due to use but this mouse has lasted me a ridiculous short amount of time before experiencing technical issues. Before I purchased it I read through some forums where people offered up their experience on Razer products and the majority of them claimed that Razer products break down too fast. I saw some complaints on the Deathadder but I figured that was a cheaply priced mice and the Naga Trinity being more expensive would likely have better build quality obviously that wasn't the case. A little over a year later I'm having a double click issue with my left mouse click and it makes dragging files on my desktop a game of chance of if I will end up opening the file or actually dragging it like I intended to and 80% of the time it's the former. My brother also ended up getting a Deathadder Elite and he is experiencing the exact same problem. Also for whatever reason whenever I select a static mouse colour through Synapse the mouse always reverts to a spectrum color cycle. I thought the whole interchangeable buttons thing was cool and that's what got me on board but I think it's safe to say that this is probably the last Razer product I'll be purchasing. My last mouse was a $30 Cooler Master mouse and it lasted me 3 years. I don't see why a mouse with this premium of a tag has made it not even a year and a half.
5,Had the same one second hand from my hubby bought this one as a replacement because the LMB started to go on the old one. Love it have been using it alongside my razer chroma keyboard for over a year.
5,I love the colour options and how easy it is to use. Plug and play is great had to install the programs and that was quick and easy. It is great for online gaming! Highly recommend. It is comfortable and I love having options to switch out the side place for when I am not gaming to have a normal mouse for regular use.
5,Me gustó mucho y me gusta que las placas removibles sirvan para cosas o juegos distintos. En algún instante dudé de que tuviera Bluetooth o fuera inalámbrico pero lo es.Jala perfectamente. Y aunque el software Synapse no hay para Mac para mi uso general y de juegos jala perfectamente y no es como que no halla otros modos de configurarlo con otras aplicaciones. De entrada se la pasa cambiando de color pero hay una app que ya me dejó apagarle eso.Recomendado y mas si lo hallan en oferta como yo.
5,The smoothly-changing color schema is quite lovely but that isn't new.  What is new is that the side-panels are replaceable and this matters a ton because the main reason I even needed to replace my old mouse is that some of the #s on the side panel (the 0-12 one) started to fail---press the button nothing happens or sometimes the # spits itself out multiple times in a row when you wanted it to fire off once.  Not good! But with this mouse if #s do start failing you (a) can take the side panel off & clean more easily or (b) replace the side panel more easily without replacing the entire mouse a big cost saving.  Plus not having wireless is really a non-issue for me.  For one for gaming I never trusted the wireless setup anyways so I always played wired regardless.  Secondly the wire is very long so for most use cases its not an issue.  (One small point could be that while on a wireless version the contact of wire to mouse is another point of failure it is a replaceable component whereas on this mouse it is not--treat the wire with care and remember that your mouse is a sometimes delicate piece of technology don't go dropping it or kinking the cord too much it is robust but not unbreakable!)
1,This is WAY TOO HEAVY.  I hate it if you geta  Naga get the X  instead.  This one is too heavy for a proper gaming mouse.
5,Je ne croyais pas a une telle différence pour gamer cette souris est juste incroyable
5,No hace doble click. Supuestamwnte es imposible peor no lo se. El programa synapse que trae es buemo para las.macros.Puedes tener hasta 24 botones en un solo perfilLo malo: el programa para mejor rendimientl en realidad empora el rendimientoNo tiene memoria integrada ene l mouse necesitas el programa para ls macros
4,This is a great mouse if you need a lot of buttons for macros. I use it for various video and 3d related software and I'm satisfied so far. It's great to have the option to change the side plates for casual gaming. The first unit I received had quality control issues (scroll wheel was wobbly few of the side buttons were not consistent) but the replacement I got is perfect so far. My only problem with it is Razer's software Synapse. It's slow and unresponsive most of the time. Their support was kind but they didn't really offer any solution after numerous emails back and forth and many log files information etc. This is the reason I gave this product 4 stars out of 5 because it is useless without the software as it's a complete package. At least you can store macros on the onboard profile and delete the software. If I couldn't do that I would definitely return it.
5,I don't understand why it won't charge when it's plugged in to this thing can someone please explain to me when I'm doing wrong
5,Al principio me parecía incomodo por ser un mouse con una estructura diferente pero ahora (1mes después de usarlo) se me hace super cómodo ahora tengo todos los botones configurados y tengo macros o teclas especiales en los 12 botones laterales y me facilita muchas cosas.
5,Realmente valen la pena aunque sea caro te dará unos 5 años de uso diario al menos así fueron los anteriores. Totalmente personalizado para los que les gusta moverle a eso.
2,Empezo a fallar a los meses
2,It is the second mouse from Razer I bought the left click broke the most recent one I only had for a year.It cannot be held down it will spam clickswhich make dragging files or spinning a camera in an mmo a pain in the ass or impossibleRazer need to make their products more durable for this price this is ridiculous.
1,Mouse came damaged half the buttons dont work and it just spam presses buttons for me nonstop i cant even type or write anything without it holding down '22222222222' nonstop. Very disappointed and will be returning. Not sure if the delivery person threw my package over the fence or something but very unhappy about this
1,NO compren este mouse despues de 6 meses de uso dejo de funcionar y debido a que es vendido por amazon estado unidos no me hizo valida mi garantia Razer NO gasten su dinero
5,Great
5,Good quality mouse by a good company.I've been using Razer products for 10+ years and the mice have usually lasted me 4-5 years at the minimum.This mouse is no different I've been using it for a couple months now and I've had zero issues and it works perfectly.The price is also fairly decent more-so if you get it while it's on sale.Switching out the side plates is also a feature I looked forward to because I can setup keybinds for my thumb to press while playing MMO's or other games.I'd definitely recommend this mouse if your looking for a good quality gaming mouse.Also it's lighter compared to the other mice by Razor by about 15-20% which is nice it's a little front heavy maybe 10-15% heavier which can be seen as a downside if you like to lift your mouse a lot while gaming but I've had no issues in that aspect.
1,NO compren este mouse despues de 6 meses de uso dejo de funcionar y debido a que es vendido por amazon estado unidos no me hizo valida mi garantia Razer NO gasten su dinero
1,After about 1 year and 4 months I started to get the double click issue (seems common from what I can see)I purchased a more expensive mouse in order to get a better mouse ... Turns out my 5 years old 40$ Death adder is still in better shape than this piece of garbage after less than a year and 4 months and for 3x the price
5,Excellent mouse.
1,After a couple weeks the scroll wheel became very difficult to scroll with.  Google brought up suggestions to add oil to it.  Ended up with a Naga X which scrolls properly even though it's an almost identical setup.
2,Worked ok at first months later the buttons would be stuck press down constantly.
3,Esta muy ancho para FPS para mobas esta muy bien lo compre por la opcion de tener mas bind keys pero es dificil levantar el mouse para jugar en shooters
5,Bought for my husband who has long hands at first we thought about returning it as it still felt small however he ended up really loosing it after a few days.
1,I like razer and still have the Naga 2012 which is going strong..this one has faulty switches..google click problem..the swtiches suck..and for the price it is unreal.  I did go back to them and got the DeathAdder V2..not as many buttons..but light and the switches are optical I think..it is great..
2,and the 12-key side plate is already starting to malfunction. I am having to spam keys for skills to activate in-game and you cannot purchase the side plates separately if they need to be replaced.Razer's suggested fix does not work. Which is cleaning the contacts [POGO pins] with alcohol or gently using a pencil eraser on them. Rinse & repeat until it decides to work.Stupid.Mouse is great when it functions properly. Not so great when it starts to fall apart less than year into  owning it. I expected it to fall apart. It's Razer after all. Though I expected it to last more than  year or two at the least. Previous Razer mouse lasted for 5 years before having any problems.Lasted less than ONE year before starting to malfunction AND you can't buy replacement side plates?Ridiculous.For how much $$$ this costs alone + any additional $$$ spent on accessories for it (charging dock sold separately but not the plates) the quality is poor.I'd buy something else if you can find what you need in another mouse.
1,I've been using it for a few hours now and I'm mostly a fan of it but the 7 button side mod isn't working at all despite an couple hours of troubleshooting.
2,TLDR: Side panel disconnects buttons if bumped (it's held with magnets)Overpriced for 2 extra side panels you'll never use.Bought the Razer Naga Trinity since it was the closest model to the Razer Naga Chroma (discontinued)that I've been using for years without any problem! however a flaw in the Trinity design is the side panel attaches with magnets and seems to be overly sensitive to bumps disconnecting the side buttons.I can't tell if it's a software issue or the hardware but simply removing the panel andplacing it back on is pretty 50/50 whether or not it wants to function.Razer has always been overpriced but adding 2 side panels I'll never use bloats the cost even more.
4,Razer has the best software of any mouse brand.I don't find the extra finger bracket on the left side of the mouse to be comfyI would have preferred more of a deathadder shape.
1,You know I loved this mouse up until I started getting that double clicking issue and other click/pointer related issues that other reviewers are having around a month ago.Who quality tested this mouse? Because that person and this company did an extremely poor job.It's just great it stopped working after the return period for the mouse was past I would love to get a refund on this because I feel like I was robbed.
5,Been using for the past two maybe 3 years now. Solid mouse no malfunctions or anything. Synapse tho if u don't have a way to block traffic to that app can get annoying with the network occasional mbsd that happens freq its usually 20-30mb download randomly and about 5 up but def annoying its using anything while in the background and not even open or windowed. Other than that nit pick its a good mouse maybe a little overpriced but its razer quality so it do be good. Reliable.
5,My very first wireless mouse and I couldn't be happier... this is the 3rd Razar Naga mouse that I've had Razer Naga Chroma Razer Naga Trinity & finally Razer Naga Pro. I love that fact that there's 3 ways to connect this mouse to my pc USB dongle Bluetooth & finally the wire. The fact that there's 2 options to charge is a bonus even if you only have the cord to charge the mouse at first unless you're lucky enough to have a charging base from another Razer mouse. all in all a top notch gaming mouse.
5,Great mouse. Was highly recommended to me from veteran gamers  and I can't see myself using anything else.
5,Es un mouse muy completo muy cómodo y se pueden jugar muchos tipos de juegos con este muy recomendado!
4,Works great please tap into the left handed market and start offering a left version of products.
3,Por el precio se siente algo delicado o frágil al usar
5,Great mouse. Was highly recommended to me from veteran gamers  and I can't see myself using anything else.
5,I was able to test it with bluetooth on my macbook and with usb signal:Bluetooth: Pairs in less than a minute and automatically reconnects in less than two seconds everytime I opened the macbook!Usb (to play): No delay at all I have no idea of what the mouse delay is but I haven't felt any on games like CSGO and Valorant where reaction time is quite important it was like when I played with my mouse plugged in but without the wire that gets in the way.The 3 types of profiles for the mouse work wonderfully and connect easily without any hassleVery good product!
5,All good
3,I've not had a mouse die on me this fast little more than a year. The price tag does not match the level of quality compared to other brands.I won't purchase any Razer products until the quality improves.
5,Really good mouse i'm happy with my purchase
2,Just like the original Naga this mouse's shape has not improved and is still uncomfortable due to the ring finger dropoff which causes the tip of your finger to reach the surface (unlike a logitech G600) and abrasive material that rubs against your palm (unlike again a logitech G600). Not worth getting this product
3,The '4' button on the number paid died within 30 days. Had to return to Amazon.Watch out for the proprietary connector that fits in to the mouse and wireless dongle as well. A normal USB cable will not fit so if you don't want to constantly switch between charging your mouse and having the dongle plugged in you will need to buy an extra cable from Razer or their charging station.Hardware profiles don't save lighting config with Synapse either so if you don't want your mouse to flash the rainbow demo-mode colours all the time you WILL have to load Synapse on PC start.Other than the poor hardware quality the questionable USB choices and the crappy software.... great mouse!
2,Double-click issue after ~3 years of moderate use. I replaced it way sooner than the previous version which actually still works half-decent by comparison (only troubled by some software issues not hardware). Unless you can get this at a deep DEEP discount don't bother. Replacing the switches is an option but consumer shouldn't have to do that after 2-3 years!
5,I play ME Skyrim ESO and SC2. I'm happy with this mouse for all my gaming. I have a bigger hand so it fits comfortably. The optional button interchangeable pieces are a nice feature. It's a nice weight not too heavy or light and performs well.
1,Small mouse not very comfortable. Good modular design but not very ergonomic.
5,Mon fils est vraiment très satisfait livraison rapide
1,Sideplates are extremely worn outCame out of the box dirty ripe from useFor some reason 2 button sideplate is recognized as the 12 button sideplateNot happy at all.
5,5/5
1,The wireless doesn't work. It has a huge stuttering problem making it useless. I spent two weeks trying to solve the issue. Turns out many have had the same problem since 2020.
1,The mouse was fine for one week after which it turned off by itself and never turned back on.
5,I play various types of games on my computer and for years I had settled for using my keyboard number pad rather than get three different mice for each gaming/usage type. I love that I can hotswap out the button pads on this without there being any noticable lag time while my computer catches up with the different button configuration. Plus I love Razer products so I'm more than a little bit biased.
5,i use this mouse for gaming everyday and it is awesome meets all my expectations
5,The variety of side panels is absolutely awesome and helpful as can be! I love switching them in and out for different needs and purposes. Mouse as a whole works super well and the software is alright
5,Very good product
5,Very good product
1,I bought this mouse because I wanted a high performance mouse that fit my hand as I've got quite a wide grip and use combination of grips but mostly claw grip for gaming.I loved it at first. I had bought it to match my keyboard and also got a matching mousepad. Up til now loved Razer.  Unfortunately after a few weeks it just disconnected from my machine and no matter what I did it would connect but only for anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours and degraded quickly..I updated my computer my firmware drivers everything I could think to update (I've been an IT professional for 30 years so am no stranger to these issues).  Nothing worked including wiping all Razer software and related drivers from my system and starting from scratch.I kept it in pristine condition so it was perfectly clean (cleaned it again anyhow just in case) and tested it in multiple computers all with the same result. A web search revealed that this is very common for Razer mice these days. Some folks can get them working again some not but it's basically a hardware failure that is super common for these devices.I paid something like 130 plus taxes for this in Canada late summer and it was a waste. Right now it sells for about 82 plus taxes so I'm guessing their popularity on this model is dropping due to performance issues.I eventually went with a Corsair Scimitar which is nearly the same dimensions but actually ended up fitting my hand better. Got it on sale so paid about one third what I paid for the Razer and I can even adjust the side buttons. It also has better LEDs for seeing the buttons on the mouse if I need to. So far works like a charm.Wish I'd bought the Corsair first instead of the Razer. So far so good with the Corsair although I will wait to review it until I have thoroughly had a chance to use and test it.
5,This mouse is perfect for League of Legends and other MOBAs.The circle of buttons has everything you need plus it is easy to differentiate each button.
1,Lo uso más que nada para MMOs por lo que uso el lado con 12 botones. A los 5 meses de uso uno de los botones ya está fallando. Pésima calidad.
1,My G600 lasted 10 years.I thought of give Razer a try and within 7 months mouse 1 started double-clicking.I can't click and drag anymore.I tried going through Razer's warranty process and they told me to buy canned air to clean it out. I didn't have any canned air so I waited.I finally got some canned air and cleaned out the mouse to no avail. I tried contacting Razer again and now my warranty is over.I've owned 3 Razer mice at this point and only ONE was without issue.I would not recommend any Razer products.
2,I enjoy my Razer Naga X can be a bit uncomfortable to use sometimes side buttons are a bit hard to get used to. I can manage to use the 2nd and 3rd rows of buttons without issues the 1st and last row are very unnatural to have to move to try and press. I heard they are known not to last which is why I bought the extended warranty offered through Amazon. Let’s hope I won’t have to use it.*** UPDATEStopped working a day after Amazon return policy. Mouse gets power (RGB illuminated) but tracking and buttons don’t work. Yes I tried other USB ports.
5,Great product
5,Initially very frustrating with random drops 3~15 seconds when on wireless.  Razer support (very aggressive! But not in a bad way) decided needed to replace... Send back first but new one sent to me seems to be working very well now. No drops so far with replacement unit.
5,My first wireless mouse as I've been using the g600 for last 3 years. This mouse feels amazing and battery lasts awhile. I did get sent a used one but it looks mint like maybe it was a return.Amazon gave me a discount tho. Great service
5,Comparado al naga anterior bajo un poco la calidad pero es buen producto posiblemente el mejor de su categoría
1,* droped the rating to 1 star for the horrible customer support.* droped the rating to 3 stars after seeing all the peoples who had the same issue as me but my replacement is working well for now *Best all-around mouse in my opinion with customization and all the yada. Only gave 4 stars because the product quality might have dropped over years. I used to have a Razer Naga Epic (blue 12 buttons no interchangeable side panel) that lasted me 7-8 years which is pretty good considering I used it for work and gaming probably 70-80+ hrs / week. Unfortunately it was discontinued in favor of the Naga Trinity. Interchangeable panels are neat but useless since I only needed the 12 buttons panel. Sadly the Trinity started to have issue with left mouse button in less than 3 months. Click wouldn't happen or get registered as double click or button would be released immediately rendering drag n drop impossible. In it defense I was playing a lot of Path of Exile so I was a bit hardcore with the left button. Managed to work around it for a while but at some point it was unbearable and lead to lot of error mistake and waste of time. I ended up replacing it quicker than I wanted. So far I don't have any issue with the new one so maybe I was just unlucky with previous one.
5,I had the naga trinity for a couple of years before i started having problems with the number 3 on the thumb. So I bought this one to replace it. Love the swapable plates i use it more often then i tought i would. Very easy to swap and works very well.
5,Razer no falla con sus mouses. Muy cómodo poder estar cambiando los botones y que puedes meterle macros a cada uno. Le puedes cambiar los perfiles. Por ejemplo en el de trabajo le tengo copy paste cut y otros macros de Excel. Para juegos los tengo para cada juego.
1,Todo funciona normal excepto el click izquierdo sostenido. Puedo hacer click y doble click normal pero falla al momento de sostener el botón para arrastrar ventanas y seleccionar texto. Es mi 3er razer naga y el que duró menos. Compré uno por ahí del 2011-2013 y me duró 6 años. Cada año vienen con peor calidad. El plástico se siente más corriente ahora a comparación del primero. No volveré a comprar un mouse razer.
