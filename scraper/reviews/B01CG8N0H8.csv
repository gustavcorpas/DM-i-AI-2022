5,This radio replaced a fully working 2001 Honda Odyssey stock AM/FM CD player. It does not fit exactly in the bay and the included mounting option was not applicable in my situation. In fact the instructions mounting procedure was not actionable at all. Thankfully I was able to bore the small holes on the side of the unit open some and use the factory brackets and two of the four screws off of the original head unit to keep the new one in place.It ended up looking decent enough but the storage bay below it has no where to latch onto now and is basically just held in place by pressure from the plastic frame and the bottom of the Boss radio. Since it only has 2 screws to hold the radio in place on the sides now the whole double bay assembly is kind of wobbly and can move up and down in the bay but no one will be pressing it from that angle so it works good enough.The unit is a bit to small for the bay or I need some kind of frame to go around the bay itself. I seen those on here but didn't think I'd need it. It's also no where near as long from front to back as the original one and is as light as a couple of pieces of paper. I though it was a prop or something at first. I am happy with it since it replaces that outdated radio and lets me link phones and other Bluetooth players directly to it.Also the internal amplification is far better than the factory model. In less than a day It has already finished off the right front passenger speaker just from turning it up with the bass boost and stuff on pushed the speaker so hard it cracked the cone and now it rattles. The speaker sounds well enough at lower volume but I'll be changing both of the front speakers next.  It was good buy for a very reasonable price. If you need a cheap radio to update or replace your own car radio then check this one out.I also took some photo's for this review so please review those for visual details. The pictures should say a lot about it. I do wish I had noticed the review about one of these units attempting to catch on fire sooner. Yikes. Thanks to their review I know to look out for that or to be ready to replace this unit eventually.
5,I have an old BMW that had the factory cassette player and I didn't want to spend a lot for a radio that's going in a 30 year old car. Bluetooth works great and sound quality is better than I expected at this price point. I should also mention I did replace the speakers which I'm sure also helps with sound quality.
5,BOSS Audio Systems 616UAB  system  came in on time as estimated  it came with clear and understable instructions has good sound for the money  chrisp highs and surprising bass when connected to my Jensen 60 watt marine speakers which are 4ohms  it also seems to like my Scandisk 64 gig thumpdrive - plays mp3 songs without any hold up and has a nice random selection for mp3 playback feather light so It is very suprising how clean the sound is playing files it is going to be used in my boat in a very salty atmosphere  I'll update this review after the salt sinks in  I won't hold it responisble if salt kills it !
3,Well it seems like I received an updated version that doesn't show the hideous car sprite on the LCD and hopefully doesn't have all of the overheating/glitching problems you'll read about in other reviews.When I first got this all wired up in my van I was super excited and went for a drive to see how loud it could get. Low volume sounded great. So I turned it all the way up to 43 (out of 43 yeah it's dumb). Big mistake. After a few seconds the speakers began to crackle and then the sound cutout completely. Couldn't get it back no matter what I tried. The faceplate was pretty hot to the touch at this point. I thought I had fried the preamp so I drove back home with a big frown.I fired it back up maybe 30 minutes later and it came back to life. It's uh worked ever since then. *Knock on wood*I did recently have it continuously playing with the volume between 30-36 while driving for about an hour and honestly it exceeded my expectations.But the heatsink does get very very hot. I wouldn't feel comfortable installing this in a smaller more cramped car console. Maybe it just works better in a larger vehicle with more space around in. I don't know. This is a really weird product. I love it and I'm also scared of it. Will update later if it breaks or if it lasts forever.
4,If you need to listen to AM radio this is not the car stereo for you. The AM radio frequency is horrible you can barely hear it through the static. Other than that this is good radio if you want to upgrade your old oem car stereo that doesn't have Bluetooth or USB.
5,My goodness there are a lot of reviews that say this radio is junk. That didn't scare me. I've thrown more money at less. We only get to use our camper a couple times a year and decided to upgrade to a unit with Bluetooth. I didn't want to spend a lot since we don't use it that much and was pleased to find this model at $36 with a handy remote. I hooked it up today- and couldn't believe I had gotten it right. Tested radio bluetooth and it seems to work as expected. I'll update my review if that changes. We have 2 more camping trips before the end of the summer and that will be the true test. It's definitely better than what we had.I upgraded the speakers and noticed that max volume wasn't very loud. Another user mentioned this. Well in the camper we only have 2 speakers and the default setting is balanced between 4 speakers so I adjusted the fade and it was super loud! I was afraid I blew one of the brand new speakers I got but I determined it was vibration in the ceiling. Fixed it with some craft foam. I love it. Love that the pause button on the remote pauses video on the iPad in Bluetooth
4,You really get what you pay for with this stereo. it is BARELY a car stereo with bluetooth. It is essentially impossible to install in a way that makes sense. What you will end up doing is just bending all the extremely thin bits of sheet metal until it stops sliding around in your din slot. Just be sure to test a decently strong button push before finishing installation because a firm press of the power button bent the sheet metal case of this stereo and launched it backwards into the dash. I would also not even bother attempting to charge anything with the provided USB port on the front of the stereo.The bluetooth does work very well though and the audio does not have any interference. The quality sounds a bit flat so i suspect some kind of compression is happening to the speaker output but the bluetooth works without fighting it including through turning the car on and off. i've only had this stereo for a few days so i will update this review if it stops functioning in the next few months. given the price i only expect this stereo to function for a few years at most.
4,good value for the money.
3,Bluetooth connectivity to my iPhone XS Max works fine - no problems pairing and the link appears solid after several hours of testing. I can press the 'volume' knob which gives me immediate access to Siri on my phone.The sound quality is what you'd expect for the price with two caveats. The first is that I haven't found a way to equalize the volume from the various sources. Perhaps this capability exists but I couldn't find it in the instruction pamphlets included in the box. What does this mean? Well let's say I have the volume adjusted for my iPhone. Now I switch to the radio. Instantly I am deafened by excruciatingly loud music! In more expensive units you can usually adjust the relative volume from each source - radio/usb/aux/bluetooth however this capability appears not to present on the Boss.The display on my unit (and most I've seen reviewed) is annoying and wonky. Annoying because the display features a 'dancing equalizer' graphic which cannot be  turned off. It's distracting adds no value to the auditory experience and the vertical bars often have gaps in them; altogether I would describe this portion of the display as 'a mess'. I may put some back tape over this area of the display.However what really disturbed me is the heat generated when the unit is actively playing rock music at moderate levels. I am running four 4-ohm speakers and the sound volume bass and clarity are very acceptable. However even at moderate volume (I am old and my ears can't handle loud music) the heat sink on the back of the unit gets too hot to touch. I used an IR thermometer and it indicates the heat-sink is operating at around 75 deg C after 15 minutes of continuous play. During that 15 minute period the current drawn by the player averaged 1.1 Amps meaning the  total power consumption was around 14W. To my mind that's uncomfortably hot and as I mentioned I didn't have the volume cranked up. The spec sheet indicates 20W RMS x 4CH however I wouldn't dare run it close to this power - my unit was struggling at just 14W combined!A large part of the problem is the heat-sink itself. The heat is concentrated at the center of the unit (behind the amp) and falls off rapidly as you move off-center with the IR thermometer. This suggests conductivity across the heat-sink is poor. Which in turn explains the temperature build up!At this price-point you can't expect too much. The USB port does provide 1A of charging power (USB2.0) and the basic formats (MP3/WMA) seem to work well. The internal microphone is very basic - I would recommend finding a unit with an external high quality microphone if you want to use hands-free calling over the head unit.I bought this head unit as a stop-gap solution until I could find a better single-DIN media player (at the time of  review many of the more desirable units are unavailable here in the USA). Hopefully it will bridge the gap until I can find a quality replacement unit that ticks all the boxes. It isn't dreadful but I recommend you ensure plenty of ventilation around this head unit.
4,It sounds great has no problem connecting to Bluetooth and can even charges my phone while driving (no fast charge).  The remote has to be in a particular area to register a button press which is not great if your driving It's safer to use the buttons on the unit itself.  The biggest gripe is the the screen being to dim to read during the day even in cloudy weather.  If I need to adjust anything but volume or manual tuning the radio during the day then your out of luck you gotta wait until dark. That why it's 4 star for me others would find this a deal breaker.  Since I mostly listen to FLAC/MP3 files off my phone via Bluetooth it's not that big of a deal.
5,The radio is small as there is no CD player. but it does have AM/FM radio Bluetooth source input AUX USB and hands free phone connection.  Maybe not the high end sound someone with a multi amp setup would want  but for the average person should do well.
4,Decent radio with great Bluetooth connection. Installed in a ‘84 Toyota pickup.
4,This radio functions exactly as expected. Sound is clear and strong. The only reason for 4 stars over 5 is the display is fairly dim. If your installation is high and in direct sunlight you might want a different unit.
3,This is a good stereo replacement for an old car but it lacks some simple functions that make the stereo just an OK product.The lack of name display of music playing on the radio is a simple but great function to have and it would have been very simple to add on. The same is for the equalizer it could be better but it only goes until a basic '80s stereo option.If buying this stereo for an old car it's a must to buy a snap-on pigtail for a color code match. I have a 94 Toyota Camry and trying to match the wires was a nightmare. I ended up buying a snap-on tail over at a local store and it make my day.
4,Installed in a 1987 Dodge CSXPros: Awesome sound price. No problem with bluetooth connection to my phone. USB MP3 player. FM reception is great.Con's: MP3 play off a thumbdrive is funky time to time. Will double play a song once in a great while one time a song was missing a track. Mic for phone use not that good when there is some background noise but still usable. Display could be brighter during the day even set to max.Still can't beat it!
4,Works fine in my daily driver
5,Got tired of using a car charger for my radio finally upgraded you do need to buy a wire harness depending on the car for my Ford escape did need the harness and stereo mount other then that quick and easy install
4,Great quality but difficult to install.
4,not bad for the money. I would buy again.
5,My card came with an unoriginal radio similar to this but way older. Purchases to replace that one and I’m glad that I did. The old one didn’t have Bluetooth functionality which is the main thing that I wanted. Wiring the supposed fairly easy and installed easy into my 1987 Toyota MR2 AW11.
4,After receiving two DOA units in a row I began to question user error and went online and learned something very useful! You must connect both the red and yellow (B+ which is intended to connect directly to a battery which may have slightly more than 12 volts) wires to your 12 volt power. Ta-da now it works fine.I got one of these units a few years ago for another application and it's pretty swell it's nice to be able to put my music on USB. The one big drawback comes with the Bluetooth connectivity. Yes it connects to my phone just fine but you have to set the radio to Bluetooth as the input in order for it to work. If you're listening to something else you will miss your calls without knowing it. It would be nice if Bluetooth would interrupt whatever other input source you're using when a call comes in. This removes one star from my rating because you can't beat this price for a mostly great little unit.
5,This head unit was much smaller and lighter than I expected (which in my case was a big bonus) For the first time installer that just wants a workable radio this is perfect with lots of bonus features you normally do not get for the price.Now the difficult part. In my case I was upgrading a 1998 Winnebago radio. The old one was OK but using cassette tapes is a way gone thing. The one warning I would give is to be careful when removing your old radio and take note of the wiring.My coach was built on a 1998 Chevy P-30 chassis which means that Winnebago for the naked frame and motor and built the rest. The wiring was for a Chevy -BUT- the old radio was from TOSHIBA which meant that there was the original wiring loom that was spliced into an adapter then into the Chevy loom. NOT the fault of BOSS but they used their own wiring color code  NOT the new standard that is used. So if you are going to do a bunch of wire matching and harness corrections you must find the original color coding from the old radio. I was lucky that there was a very faded sticker on the old radio and I could match it tot the new BOSS wiringOF NOTE if you are not sure of coding any wire that has a black strip on it is the ground for the speakers The solid black wire off the BOSS unit is a ground . So if you get confused remember black is a ground and the other color is the positive to your speakers and on the BOSS the coding is white/white black stripe grey/grey stripe as examples EACH set of wires you need are color sets. But over all once I figured the factory color guide from 22 years ago it went right together.ONE FINAL THING before you run out and buy a mounting kit check you vehicle it may be very likely you do not need one! The radio comes with the expandable mounting frame and all you do is take it off the control head insert it in the hole and bend the tabs. Next just slide your new BOSS in and it will snap in place flush. The BOSS radio comes with EVERYTHING you need to do a basic mounting right down to a grounding screw if you need one. The kit is complete so don't rush out and buy anything until you take the old head out
3,My 1973 Citroen has five wires for a car stereo two of which are for the speakers – one in the front one in the back. Imagine my surprise when I was looking at this unit’s two (!) harnesses which contain approximately 723 color-coded wires. Yes it was slightly confusing at first but after installing uninstalling and reinstalling this damn thing several times I finally got it right. My biggest gripe so far is the ridiculously crappy metal mounting frame that is of poor quality. This thing is not providing ANY support for the stereo whatsoever which kept rapidly disappearing into the center console whenever I pressed any button ever so lightly. I ended up building a wooden support inside the vertically mounted console which is now propping up the stereo from behind and underneath. I’m happy that my design is working but how petty of the manufacturer to try saving 12 cents or whatever by including a frame so thin that it wouldn’t even support the weight of a toothpick.
5,Just wanted a radio for outside on rv works great plugged in without problem
4,Easy to install in my 2000 motorhome which previously had a Sony.Bluetooth and phone call clarity good for an inexpensive radio.Could have a higher intensity light.
5,My dad and I installed this in my 2007 Honda Accord. He has a great deal of experience working on cars but not on radios. After watching a couple YouTube videos installation took roughly 45 minutes and was fairly easy. I did purchase a dash kit and some butt connectors in addition to the radio but other than that everything I needed it came with. It’s been installed for roughly 2 months now with no problems.
4,Replaced a Factory Cassette Radio in a '94 Explorer to get Bluetooth & Aux inputs..Exceeded my expectations.Bought 2 pairs of 5"×7" speakers same brand. You don't have to spend a fortune to get great sound. W/Remote & Hands free phone through stereo I've joined the 21st Century.
5,best product ever
5,I was surprised how small the depth was on the unit and light weight. great power output for small design.Bought two of them  One for front of RV and one for the rear bedroom.
5,Excelente
5,Excellent
4,The Bluetooth is easy to setup and having a remote is perfect for the Sauna setup.
5,Looking for an inexpensive speaker to put in an old Jeep.  This Boss fits the bill easy to install perfect sound for an all-purpose speaker
2,This is a cheap head unit.  If that's what you're after then this is for you.  Unit is very small only about 5 inches deep single DIN.  Sound quality is fair but it seems to vary on AM with voices modulating pitch like they're going in and out of a tunnel.  Big issue for me is the display brightness.  Even on the highest setting it's too dim to read in normal daylight.  I have to constantly cup my hand over the display to read it (at a stop light :-)...  I don't know if I have a bad unit or not for the display brightness but it does change from lo-med-hi on the settings.  At night it's fine.UPDATE:  I tried it for a few weeks but returning due to too many problems.  I like to listed to AM talk radio and the sound quality was awful.  FM and USB was pretty good.  Never could get the fader to work. Display was also too dim and created a hazard if trying adj settings or station while day driving.Installation was in 2001 Corolla.  There are NO threaded mounting holes on the Head Unit so I had to drill holes in the stock brackets and use short sheet metal screws to mount in the stock location.  If I had known any of this before I would have just bought a better head unit with better mounting attachment points.  If you do get this don't forget the Metra Toyota harness adapters so you don't have to be 'that guy' who butchered the stock wiring.  Also and I checked all my connections for continuity before I finished the install but the front to rear fade doesn't work.  Could be my install though I was very careful but I haven't torn it apart yet to diagnose.
4,You really can’t ask for much better than this unit for the price.  It really delivers more than what you’d expect for this price point.  My only gripe is that the remote is pretty useless as you practically have to hold it less than an inch from the unit for it to work - really has no use for anyone in the back seat.
4,Initial impression was this is great it went in easy in my old truck and sounded much better.  After two days it stopped playing sound.  Boss was no help at all.  I found that the connector for the speaker wires is junk.  When barely touching it played but fully connected it stopped.  Boss wanted me to pay $25 for a new connector for a $32 radio.  I ended up using some dielectric grease inside the plug that seems to have solved the bad connection.  I think it is a good value but be prepared to tweak on it.  Sound is good and the Bluetooth connects great.
3,It works ok. The Bluetooth does not always connect to my devices when I start up so I have to put manually pair them. The remote did not work at all. Paid $10 for batteries to see if that was the problem. Still nothing. Save your money and buy a better unit. Very disappointed in my first Bose product
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Super easy installation on my 2006 Toyota Corolla. Bluetooth works flawlessly and easily. Sound quality is impressive for the price.First day of ownership but I will update if it ends up going bad.
3,Can't complain the stereo does the job and it's real easy on the pockets the only reason I quit using it I gave it to a friend because I bought a used Alpine and we know why because in my opinion they're the best but getting back to boss they made a good unit for a good price do not buy any other car stereo for $40 cuz you're going to get what you pay for I think this one was 60% off and I got it for $40 so happy shopping
5,Is good
4,It is a nice radio for the price. The Bluetooth works great. I can even talk on the phone through it. The only negative is that I can not keep the preset radio stations. It reverts back to factory setting every single time I turn the car off. The remote is not very user-friendly but it works fine.
5,For years I was stuck on JVC radio's for cars and truck and I always had problems. I decided to try BOSS Audio. To cheap to be good I thought. I was wrong. I now have 1 in each of my trucks. And the blustooth and sound are amazing and easy to program.
4,I couldn't believe how good this little unit performs. Easy install. I live in the country with bad AM reception. I connected it to my phone with the apps I like and now I have it all. Best radio I've seen and all under $40.
4,Off the rip I had to take away one star. I was skeptical buying this head unit due to the price. The first unit I received did not produce sound. I suspect the built in amplifier was to blame. I sent it back and received a second unit a day later and now after a few months of use it's still going strong. For a budget head unit I expected some subpar QC and possible failures off the rip.If you want a cheap head unit that will give you bluetooth connectivity then this is a solid choice. It connects without issue very quickly every time I crank my truck. I haven't had any issues with usability. The buttons and knobs feel a little cheap but are durable enough to last you a few years. At this price point that is to be expected. The plastics are also pretty cheap but again durable enough to get the job done.  I will say that the knob on this unit is smooth and has a good feel to it. The buttons are pretty clicky and have good feedback when pressed and depressed.All in all I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants to spend the least amount possible for a bluetooth headunit that will work. (Provided you don't get a lemon) Even with the potential of getting a lemon and having to send it back...this is still worth the gamble. Just keep sending your unit back until you get a winner. If you want to avoid all of that then spend twice as much for a better name brand. They will perform the similarly at the end of the day.
5,1995 300zx  Bluetooth  and eq
3,Hands-free is not clear. Not able to use this feature. Great sound.
4,Works great for streaming music from my iPhone. Pairs fast and never drops. Not great for handsfree calling. You will hear them just fine but they will barely be able to hear you. I even tested it out to see what it sounded like on the other end and it wasn’t great.
5,I was amazed by the sound quality and features of a $35 Car Stereo. I have the stock speakers (16 yrs old) and was able to tune it with treble and integrated EQ which gave me fidelity to add up I have a small amp and Sub which complemented the sound experience.Freaking Bluetooth works perfectly for calls and music for the money it's worth trying.Very pleased will recommend it.
5,BOSS Audio Car Receiver (No CD/DVD) Model 616UAB | Single Din Bluetooth MP3/USB/SD AM/FM Wireless Remote        I have been wanting a Bluetooth enable/compatible car audio head unit for the past several months. Like most everyone else that has a smartphone I keep my favorite music on a memory card or on the internal storage disk of my phone. The factory installed stereo on my van that I drive for work is AM/FM radio with a standard CD player only. No AUX input and of course no Bluetooth. I finally decided to search Amazon for a new car stereo with at least Bluetooth that wasn't too pricey. I was expecting to have to spend around $100 or so and maybe if I was lucky I could find something worth having for as little as $75.Low and behold the first item listed in my search results was this little gem: The BOSS Audio systems 616UAB Bluetooth MP3 compatible Digital Media AM/FM stereo receiver. With on-board USB AUX-in. and SD card reader all integrated with a remote control to go along. Everything I was looking for and then some. All for UNDER $40!!!!! I couldn't believe it when I saw it. I immediately placed the order. Within a week the package arrived and I was ready to bring the work van up to date with the latest technology. Installation was super simple with the assistance of how-to videos posted on other websites. I had the unit installed and working in less than half an hour. I could not believe how loud and clear the music coming from the factory speakers was. The Bluetooth paired with my phone and the controls were as simple as could be. Now I have the capability to make and receive phone calls without having to turn the radio volume down or off completely because now the 616UAB stereo automatically pauses whatever song is playing or switches from the radio station when a phone call is comming through or if you are dialing out. Even if the unit is powered down when a call is placed or is coming in the Bluetooth comes to life and the conversation colmes through the stereo speakers. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I would recommend this to anyone and eveyone. Great quality for such a low price. I decided to upgrade the front door speakers as well since the cost of the head unit was so low. With the BOSS stereo unit the wire harness purchased seperately to accomodate the after-market stereo and the upgraded speakers in the front doors I still have less than $70 total invested in my new car audio system. It is as loud as I want and then some and has all the "bells and whistles" I wanted when I decided to make the investment in a new car audio entertainment system.
4,A couple issues with wiring in this aftermarket stereo with my 97 Ford Expedition. Of course old harnesses didn't match up but BOSS harnesses looked straight forward. Well all matched up except I had an extra orange power wire to stereo that didn't match harness so once I figured that out then head powered on.NEXT was the speakers. All speaker wires matched up okay but then plugged in and no sound. Internal 10AMP fuse I tried to pull it out to check fuse and fuse disintegrated as I pulled it out. So had to buy a new fuse. But still no sound. Finally thanks to you tube video I figured out that I had an extra light blue car amp wire that needed to be powered so I spliced in the light blue amp wire from from car to the red ignition wire and got power to built in car amp and then the speakers worked.Not a great wiring harness or instructions but in the end it was figure out able and the stereo Bluetooth AM/FM radio are all working good. Lets hope things last for many years. :)
4,I finally installedd this in my car... I like to clean my car with 70 percent rubbing alcohol the plastic on the screen went completely white.. and it now looks like an old stereo but i just installed it 2 days ago... This stereo is using some glue residue on the plastic on the screen my other stereo or any part of my car has no issues w rubbing alcohol.. or any plastic i have cleaned..  this is sad i don't know what to use to clean it...  I hope Boss fix this quality issue....Updated picture i figured out how to clean the white residue used soap didn't work use toothpaste didn't work then used wd-40 after cleaning it for 10 minutes w wd-40 it finally got rid of most the white residue.. I'm now again happy..This is a good stereo but i recommend using some wd-40 on a towel to first clean the glue residue that's on the screen.... This glue residue is something that Boss needs to fix.. if you clean it with rubing alcohol the glue residue will turn white color and you're stereo will look like it's 20 yrs old in the sun...Overall happy with the functions of the stereo...😁
4,Fairly easy to install on 2002 Impreza. Just a tip: don’t cut wires too short but you will be wiring to an adapter most likely. (sold separately)
4,So I ordered this thing at the end of January and its now the end of May. Memorial Day actually. I am completely satisfied with what it is and what I spent. This is one of the least expensive car stereos you can get and I'm not a car audio expert but I know enough to know this was a solid purchase. It has not failed at all and does everything it says it would do. I took my time installing it and made good connections and the only issue I had was a little bit of alternator whine but after doing the "big 3" upgrade that whine is gone and the sound quality is better than expected. Not studio quality obviously but everyone I play music for says it sounds great. I think it sounds great.That's what matters. The one thing about it that annoys me is when I go to adjust the fade from front to back it is a large volume change. Like one click from 0 to -1 to the back makes the front speakers a LOT quieter. I wish the change was more gradual but fine tuning the amp settings fixes that since you want all your levels at a flat 0 anyway. Other than that I love this thing.
4,I bought this used car not to long ago and it had the factory cassette player in it.  For some reason adapters wouldn't work with it so I decided to look to replace it I found this Boss bluetooth unit for 30 something dollars so I ordered it got it a day or 2 later and now have tunes it connect to my phone fast and easy.  I would suggest if u purchase this buy a wiring harness adapter.  I forgot to so I had to wire each individual wire.
5,Perfect fit like a glove in 94 Ford Escort. After reading other reviews saying how cheaply built this was I was expecting just that. The build is better than my 2  Kenwoods and as good as my Alpine. I really like the layout of the radio memory buttons on the side way better than the bottom horizontal layout on other radios. You can change channels with gloves on. The BT connectivity is really simple on the setup. On one of my Kwds I use the Aux now because it's such a PITA to get a connection. Sound quality is good but if you want thumping base you'll need an amp because I do notice distortion if I use the loudness or some of the EQ settings. The standard setting is good for the music I listen to. I was replacing the factory cassette stereo and figured for my needs the 616UAB would be fine. If you have special needs spend $$$ on something else if you're the hard to please type. I couldn't be happier and told my buddy he should get one of these to replace the OEM stereo that melted in his Ford.
3,This stereo went in my minivan. Cannot get a clear reception on ANY radio station and Bluetooth with the CELL phone does not work at all very POOR QUALITY
4,For the price this Deck works great. Bluetooth hooks up easy sound is good no problems.
4,Sounds pretty good especially for the price. I bought this as a "temporary" radio to use until it stops working there is a tiny bit of static noise though.
4,Adaptación complicada pero se pudo adaptar a Nissan Bluebird U12 fácil gestión de cables buen sonido!! Recomendado
4,Installed these in a motorcycle fairing. So far they sound good and look decent. We'll see how they perform in the long run
5,Modernsimple and easy to install. Comes with all the label on the wires. Comes with a controller which is great when in traffic. The blue light from the display is bright enough in the day and suddle at night. Bluetooth is good. USB charge is amazing and has been a life saver. Lits in my classic truck with 500 watt speakers.
5,This radio is pretty good for what it cost and so far the sound is pretty good.  My only gripe is that when the radio is radio is at low volume like around 4 or 5 I can hear my car rev a little bit through the speakers. But once you turn the volume up you can't hear it at all. All 4 speakers are working but I need to hook up the factory sub still to it.  If you have volume control on your steering wheel it will not work with the radio.  You will just have to get used to that when you want to turn up or down the volume.  The Bluetooth works really well also and if you get a call the call the call is very clear with no static call plus the microphone works really well too.
5,Works nice and looks good.
1,Based on reading other user reviews I knew what I was getting myself into. My goal was to replace the original stock stereo in my 2001 Toyota Rav4 as economically as possible (though now I don't know what I'm going to play all my cassette tapes on). I had been using a Bluetooth dongle/FM transmitter for the past few years which is a workable however cumbersome solution. Plus the sound quality over FM was pretty terrible.After a small bit of looking around on Amazon I decided to give this stereo a try. I figured if it didn't work out I wouldn't have lost too much money after all. Keep in mind that you may need to also purchase a mounting kit and adapter plugs (that ran me about another $20). I did the installation myself which was actually kind of fun. I recommend a good soldering iron for wiring the adapter to the stereo plugs (I replaced my old decrepit soldering iron with a new one for this install as well and I'm quite happy I did so // about another $25 here but totally worth it). The soldering was super easy; just match up all the colors silly!Once the install was complete I was eager to test it out. The good news is that my primary objective if getting a direct Bluetooth connection to my phone so I could stream Spotify was a success! I was quite happy to say goodbye to the FM transmitter static. On the downside the interface to this stereo is pretty abysmal. Here are my complaints in no particular order:1. The bouncing equalizer bars don't actually move to the audio. In fact it seems to be a specific pattern that just repeats itself over and over even when there is no audio playing.2. When reconnecting to my phone (by starting the vehicle or cycling the input source) the stereo always sends an auto-play signal to my phone. I find this to be annoying as I would prefer to manually start playing my audio.3. When the "loudness" option is turned on I get a distinct audio pop when I turn the volume up or down one pop per volume number. Not only does that sound really bad it makes me worried for my speakers. I won't be using the loudness option.4. The user manual is supremely lacking and is come cases the English is pretty bad (though I've seen much worse).5. When setting the time the only way I could figure to change the time from AM to PM was to switch it to a 24hr clock then set the time to say 19:30 then switch it back to a 12hr clock to get it to read PM7:30 (yes the PM indicator is in front of the time for reasons I can't fathom).6. The pause button is the "1" button on the presets. While there is a tiny play/pause icon below the button it's hard to see and it's really not intuitive.All that aside if you're goal like me it to simply get out of the car audio dark ages then this will do the trick without breaking the bank. If you strive for greatness however I suggest spending a bit more on something that is not the cheapest stereo you can possibly find.*** UPDATE 2019-10-02 ***I have since replaced this stereo with a more expensive Sony MEX-N5300BT system and I am MUCH happier for it. The audio quality of the BOSS stereo was actually pain inducing after more than a few minutes. Lot's of audio popping especially when changing the volume. At some point (not exactly sure when this happened) if I didn't have the loudness feature enabled the audio would blast at full volume all garbled. Between the audio quality issues and user interface issues I strongly recommend looking for a better system.
5,Installed on a 2000 Silverado.I read reviews before purchasing and most of them were bad but since I got a deal on it I went ahead and got it. It works great so far and the sound quality is really good. Of course it’s not gonna be loud to shake the whole vehicle but it’s good enough for regular music listening. At first I thought it wasn’t good because when I plugged in the front speakers there was no bass but the problem ended up being my speakers that had gone out. Even then with only the mini back speakers working 100% it has great sound. I can’t wait to put in new front speakers and see how much better it can sound. But overall for the price it’s great and a hell of a lot better than the blaukpunt i had on there before.
5,I am surprised of how good this unit is considering how cheap I got it for and wasn't expecting much from this tiny unit but I was wrong. After tuning the equalizer base and treble it sounds great and better than my old pioneer that was done for. It also goes pretty loud I have 4 speakers hooked up straight to this unit (no amp) and can go almost to max volume without clipping. So far I have no issues with the Bluetooth connection. It connects instantly and keeps a good connection. My only complaint and it's not a big deal is that during a sunny day it's hard to see the screen it's not very bright but really that's it. Overall I'm very happy with this unit and I hope it last me a long time.
3,So i installed this on my vehicle and the bracket did not fit the radio because of the strange single DINN half rack design. not a big deal tho i just crammed it in with the little mounting plate that came with it to get a friction fit and it holds okay. as long as you order the proper wiring kit and pre wire it and mount it in the new mounting kit before going in your car it installs prety easy. Now for the down sides It sounded like a dog yelping from 2 blocks away when i first pluged it up. After reading the instruction book i realised that in order to get to the EQ settings you need to press select witch is not on the display at all (as far as what i have seen so far) I wanted to throw out the stupid little remote off the bat but now i cant. because if i do the audio will sound horrible every time i change my battery. As far as my over all thought tho. its a great buy for the price as long as you have done car audio before and know a little about what you are doing. If you are a first timer then go buy something in the $150 range. it will be less head ache. I will be buying this again for my other project car now that i know what to expect
5,I don't usually have time for reviews but this radio deserves a positive for buyers.This is definitely a very good buy for an excellent reliable multimedia radio.Switched from an older 1996 Dodge Ram Van clunky heavy radio that could not get stations to this beauty.What a difference! Although two totally different radios and hookups this Boss radio installed (with adapter needed) very easily. A little patience always makes it install perfect. Gets many many stations while parked in my garage!If you need a reliable name radio this is the one.
4,Was fairly easy to install it helps to have a wiring diagram of your vehicle and proper tools (I just used a knife and a lighter for the heat shrink) Bluetooth works great and was easy to set up. The only things I don't like about it is that it doesn't always display the time (you have to hold down the knob for a second) and that it doesn't have a disk slot (but cant complain for the price)
4,Very good to run
3,I mean it does it job and it worked just overall sucks
5,Nice price
5,This is a GREAT Stereo Radio and USB Player!!  I haven't yet used the BlueTooth capability so I can't expand on it.  I have many USB dongles with Songs already loaded on them for playing on my computer and home stereo so it only made sense to add this kind of player to my 2000 Ranger small pickup truck.  The hook-up went well with the provided leaflet that was included with the Radio/Player wiring connections.  I purchased the recommended wiring harness for the truck that it was installed in.  The little stereo radio picks up great with the factory antenna for the old radio.  Even better than that is the USB port that my USB preloaded mp3's dongles fits in.  The songs load in a flash and the music names and artists names are scrolled onto the screen.  To be honest I didn't think a less than $25 dollar stereo could sound this great but it does!!  I got tired of cd player/radios not reading the discs correctly or scratched discs; so this little radio/usb mp3 dongle player is a joy to operate and listen to.  Apparently you can also Bluetooth a cell phone to play stored music to this player but I haven't yet done that or needed to.  I don't need to clog up my cell phone with songs but answering the phone by way of the stereo sounds like a great hands free idea that I haven't yet done with it.  Great Piece of Stereo Gear!!
4,Not bad for the price. Sounds ok I have pioneer 6x9s and maybe they just need replaced. Shallow design made mounting easy I'd probably buy again if the need arises for a cheap Bluetooth car stereo.
5,Nice light little radio. Meets my needs.
4,Nice item for is price
5,Works pretty good for how cheap it is its really loud too. I would recommend as a cheep alternative for name brands so you dont have to spend double to tripple for a head unit
5,I'm completely satisfied with this radio so far. I just can't believe the amount of technology/features this little unit has for the low price of under $32. Great sound Bluetooth capability aux input wireless remote and hands free cell phone capabilities. A ton of bang for your buck. I actually purchased three comparable radios because I really wanted to see exactly what you get for this price range. This radio beat out the other two units by a mile! Hopefully it'll last a couple years!
3,I tried to install this in a 2004 Camry. Long story short it doesn’t fit.I tried to mount it to the Metra 99-8231 dash kit for my car and the problem is there aren’t any screw holes for it to attach. I didn’t want to leave my radio dangling. I’m thinking that my problem could be the problem with most cars that have double din stereos originally. Just make sure to research.
5,Bought this to replace original stereo in my 2018 Jayco travel trailer. Took about  5 minutes to install because wire harnesses  from existing stereo that no longer powered up fit the boss stereo perfectly! Got it fast from Amazon and at a great price! I’m very happy with it paired to my phone quickly. This is obviously not a top of the line unit but at around 40$ it’s perfect for camping.
5,The overall setup was very easyand the Bluetooth worked great.Sound was unbelievable.Exceptional radio for the money.Works for me
5,Hard to believe the quality of the radio for the buck
4,Remote was missing.
3,Bluetooth works fine
4,Great for the price. Fits nice and sounds good. Only complaint is that the Bluetooth calls don’t work for me. Can hear the caller but they can’t hear me
4,Still works great
2,I don't know if I have a faulty unit or if they're all the same. My balance right and left works but fade front and back doesn't isolate. If I center the fade I get no audio. Nice it one click front or rear and both front and rear come on. I'm not sure if it's worth sending back and trying again or just better to buy another cheap unit
4,Very easy install easy to use. It just kinda works with out a bunch of useless crap
4,Easy installeasy Bluetooth connection not wild about the few options for display ( clock  etc) but definitely worth the price for my work van.
5,I love it!!!
2,When it worked the sound quality was not good. It started doing weird stuff like dialing my voice mail randomly. Then it would change channels or inputs? Then I could not turn it off. Now it just runs through the menu items rapidly. I tried to factory reset with power off/on/cycled/short push/long push Standing on my head -literally while pugging and unplugging power.I don't know why I gave it two stars? I guess I just don't expect much from a $33 radio.
5,I installed this BOSS radio as a replacement in my 2001 Ford Ranger truck.  This truck already have a single DIN aftermarket pioneer radio which had died. The old radio slid out easily. The old radio already had the Ford wire harness plug so I removed it from the old pioneer radio to use on the new BOSS radio.  All wires from the BOSS radio are color keyed and matched up perfectly to the wire plug from my old radio.  Once the wires were ready it was a simple plug into the truck for the wire harness and the antenna. The new BOSS radio slides into place using the existing pioneer DIN rack (I didn’t need to use the rack supplied with the BOSS radio).  The new radio is working perfectly. It looks great and works great. Sound quality is excellent and is at least as good or better than the old pioneer.  The new Bluetooth functionality with the BOSS radio works great from my iPhone for phone calls and Bluetooth audio streaming. For a new installation it was quick and easy and my first impression is very positive.  I’ll see how the long term use goes but based on the first use it is all looking very good.
5,Me gusta mucho
5,Installed in an old Jeep XJ.  Wasn't needing anything fancy or for superior sound.  My son simply wanted to be able to play music from his phone wirelessly.  That said I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the bluetooth connection and how quickly it connected.  I've seen other in-dash stereos that take 15+ seconds to connect.  This connects as quickly as most wireless earbuds which is plenty quick for the application.NOTE: The display does not dim when the headlights are turned on.  It's a very bright blue.For $36 I don't think that you can beat the value.
5,I had an old CD AM/FM boom box with a wired in auxiliary USB port with four big strategically located house speakers serving as the music source in my shop. It finally got torched and died. I didn't want to invest too much in another sound system just the essentials. An FM radio and a media player. I have no further use for CDs or an elaborate receiver they quickly become subject to sawdust metal shavings paint and flying sparks.This Boss Car Stereo was inexpensive enough to give it a try. I got a 15amp DC converter and mounted it in a nice cabinet with a plexiglass cover. The convenience of its  functions was well worth the price alone. It pushed the four big speakers to  the max with no sound distortion throughout. The equalizer offered just the right ambience to fill my entire shop.The remote of course is good for close range as in a vehicle. But great to skip through songs without going to the unit. And with the BT iPhone I can be over 40' across the shop and it still functions.Its really straight forward to hook up. Most of the buttons/knobs are standard functions. I still have to scan the manual to do the more complex programing. The manual has a numbered illustration of the buttons but I couldn't find a reference to their function there is one for the remote. Maybe a missing page?One thing I noticed when I put music on my USB there was a slight skip and the beginning of each song. Maybe I'll give them a one or two second pause between songs.This Boss unit is light and small but very big in performance features and even looks classy.  I'm ordering a few more to actually install in my service trucks.
5,Great item for the price
4,I have been using this unit so far for two days. Very simple but clean design. Looks more expensive than it costs. I am not using the internal amp so I cannot attest to how good the internal amps sound is. I have a two amp setup running 4ch pre-amp out from the unit to an 8ch amp then using that amps pre-amp outs to run to the subs amp.For $30 I'm pretty impressed and would recommend this unit to anyone that just wants good sound that does not empty your wallet. The Bluetooth also works quite well without connection issues or weird popping or cracking sounds like other cheap units in this price range. My only complaint is that even when you set the screen brightness to it's highest it's still not that visible during the day when it's bright outside which is why I deducted a star.
5,Really Good Radio for the Price After 2 Months or So it Still Works Good & Connects to My Phone Via Bluetooth Right Away!All Around a 5/5 in My Book! I’ve Owned Kenwood Pionner and this One at less than Half the Price Sounds Just Like Those Brands!
5,This system was a great install on my 1997 Ford F-250. Instructions are good for a intermediate diyer.  I consider myself handy with automobile electric and this was a 15 minute install. The fit and finish were very nice and set up was easy. The only con is when I’m use it does not show the clock. All and all great buy.
4,I really liked this unit it looks sharp and sounds decent.The mounting cage and plugs for the power/audio are different than what I had installed so some wiring and fitting was needed. Otherwise it was an easy install.The price is real reasonable also.
4,Easy to hook up and works wonderfully
5,It's really solid for the price highly recommend if you want something that's cheap and makes decent sound. Had it for about 3 months and not an issue.
5,I was able to use the original mounting equipment from my '99 Tacoma SR5 (with just some small obvious tweaks using pliers and filing the lower plastic bin flush) but I needed to find the right size of screws that would fit the holes in the new radio.  These did the job.As for the radio itself it's amazing for the price.  It controls the speakers fade and bass and such just fine.  I got it because I wanted a Bluetooth radio and also one that could charge my phone.  One annoyance with the Bluetooth is that it often pauses after first connecting and playing for a few seconds requiring you to start the music from the phone again.To install it I found a '99 Tacoma radio wire chart guide online cut the truck wires off the original connecter and joined them using small blue twist connecters from the hardware store.  I taped off the ends of the extra wires and ignored them.  Just be careful with the one live wire.  I shorted out the domelight fuse and it took awhile to track down the problem.
4,Louder and better sound quality than my stock 2005 GM stereo. Product was easy to install but if pushed hard enough while in the dash kit I bought (doesn't allow the use of the factory faceplate ring) the head unit slides back inside of its install sleeve. This should definitely not happen. But otherwise it functions properly. Based on the other reviews I may report back in a couple months. But as of today it works fine. I have a sub and amp installed but they are tapped into speaker level input( installed before this head unit) so I can't speak on how well the line level rca Jack's do but I'd suspect they work fine.  It would be nice to have a MID adjustment along with the BASS and TREB that are there. But for the price this thing will do just fine.
5,The shallow depth made this radio perfect for the limited space in the dash of my 1941 Lincoln.  It sounds good.  Looks good. Easy to figure out how to operate.  Prompt shipping.  I like the graphic equalizer.  I can't speak for the installation because I hire all work done but my mechanic didn't complain.  I will buy this again for another classic car.
4,Bought Sept 17 died January 28. RIP! Audio quit working shows it's sending audio out but isn't.
5,This thing was a great replacement to the old one that came with my car Bluetooth works good I costomized a lot of the speakers and wiring to a subwoofer and connecting it to an adjuster panel cuz im a girl that likes my bass but I like to be able to adjust my mids and highs so I dont go deff I didn't really get a chance to test how it sounded before the mods so I can't really say but it works good lights up you can ask it outloud to play songs which is cool for those with no extra range control panel I couldn't find the adjusters for that but im sure they exist you can set the types of sounds tho flat bass boost talking so on. Over all it works well for my suv.
4,This was written roughly two months after installing. Used a Metra Double DIN conversion install kit and Metra vehicle specific wiring harness.Unit has been great. Bought a used car for under $3k and it didn't have a working stereo. Didn't want to spend much and this delivered. Connects to Bluetooth without any delay unlike some factory radios and power output is good.It's a terrific unit for the price -- aside from a few minor things it's not any different than some $200-$300 units I've owned.Here's the minor things:- It's kind of bright- Equalizer is limited but not terribly- Interface is a bit dry on features... Not really a big deal.For those looking to install at home with no experience have no fears. Use QUALITY online resources and make sure to buy a vehicle specific (ex. Ford 1998-up) as well as the proper install kit (slightly vehicle specific). The radio comes with a wiring harness that plugs into the unit and the vehicle specific harness splices into that harness and plugging into the factory plug. There's a diagram (rear left +/- etc) that says it all. Just match the colors.That's mostly it. In all a great value.
5,For $35 this exceed my expectations! It was easy to install however I did have to use some of my own screws because the provided sleeve would not work with my aftermarket conversion kit. The Bluetooth capabilities are sweet and the music sound is great!
5,Would buy again. Quality/price Can't be beat
2,Fantastic sound quality loved the  bluetooth (Although I had to manually connect every day). Sadly it has stopped working after less than 8 months. Installation was more than twice the cost of the deck so purchasing another and reinstalling would be too costly. I will not be buying another.
5,I bought this for my son's Ranger which can only fit single din radios. This was ideal because all he does is listen to stuff on his phone anyway. The build quality and audio quality actually surprised me. I really wasn't expecting it to be that good for only around $35. The Bluetooth connects immediately upon starting the truck and it integrated well with the Amp and subwoofer setup he has. I would definitely buy it again.
3,fit my car no problem but the radio reach is way to small. cant really get many stations.
5,Didn't think it would sound as good as it did. But for the price you can't beat it. Can answer my phone while driving. Just push button on radio and your connected. Works good.
5,I honestly didn't expect this stereo to last this long for the price that I paid. I just wanted something that would play music off of my USB drive and not break the bank. I have used the bluetooth a couple of times off my cell phone and it works fine. Clock still functions and it still plays my music and that's all I really care about it doing. I don't need or expect pristine sound quality with a bunch of bells and whistles or I would have paid much more if I wanted that. This stereo sounds fine and I am very happy with my purchase. It's also a nice looking stereo. If there was anything I would suggest I would say to make the dim mode a bit dimmer it's kind of too bright even at night.
5,Installations was easy. My only complaint is that the supplied bracket is very thin metal. I ended up using a few small tek screws to hold the radio in place The instructions include a wiring diagram that made it very easy to connect to the factory adapter.
4,Great for the price
4,Muy buen servicio llego rápido y excelente producto.
4,Does it sound the best? No not even close.Does it pack a ton of features? Not particularly.Is it built well? Ehhhhh questionable at best.Is it the best you can get for the money? Absolutely.I was looking for the cheapest Bluetooth car stereo I could possibly get for my Miata and that’s exactly what I got. The Bluetooth connects pretty fast and it outputs music from my phone which is all I need it to do. Can’t ask for much more for $30 pretty solid buy if you just need something and don’t care too much about quality.
3,Can't see the screen during the day which makes it hard to use. Radio is so small it requires an antenna adapter. Otherwise works well.
4,Lasted for a few years. Bought a new one to replace old one. Seems the housing has changed. Great cause there was too much room on the inside but now I need to change how I mount it.
3,Great sound and Bluetooth connectivity but after about a month I could not access the radio only Bluetooth.
5,Great little radio for the money. Simple to work and set up. Screen could be a little brighter during the daytime sun but if you have tinted windows it shouldn’t be a problem. I’m very happy with my purchase.
3,Sound knob interface doesn't always work
3,A good car radio for the money
5,the unit is light and small. good price for good quality
5,Perfect
5,The BOSS stereo is a great deal especially for cheap vehicles and golf carts.  I've put one in my '98 4Runner mud and snow vehicle and my thousand dollar EZGO golf cart.  Fantastic!  As long as your speakers are decent this is a great unit for $30.  My 4Runner has a factory amplifier in it and the BOSS sounds just fine.  I probably wouldn't put one in my Lexus but it definitely does what it says on the tin.  And it's amazing how lazy all these reviewers are that complain about lack of connectivity with factory Bluetooth controls.  For Christ's sake mate how hard is it to reach 18" to turn a knob or press a switch?  snowflakes are falling...
4,So far the Boss unit is doing really well for how inexpensive it is. I have noticed a couple of items like the volume level is not the same when switching from the radio to Bluetooth or auxiliary source or phone calls through the unit. I do like the different levels of brightness that can be selected on the display. The remote is nice as well but I haven't used it a ton yet. The USB on the front is good to have as a charging part for you phone as well if needed. I swapped this in place of an old pioneer cd unit in a mid 90's Jeep Grand Cherokee. Zero issues with installation.
5,I’ve seen a lot of mixed reviews. But you got this for my 2000 accord.  And wiring is super simple. It’s just color to color that’s literally it.  if u buy the harness and frame it’s easy and saves you time as well. The audio is is actually really good. I would recommend this if you don’t want something too expensive.
4,A bit slow to boot up even for radio and can use a bit more bass. Either case works good for a basic head unit
3,Its okay for the price.  My radio in my Ranger started to slowly die no longer playing audio. Which wasn't too big a deal for me because I could still use it as a clock.  But eventual the whole thing died and I had nothing.  So i wanted to look into a cheap radio that will work as occasional music and a CLOCK.Pros:CheapWiring correlated exact colors to match my harness so it made wiring easy& Audio sounds fine to me.Cons:The clock is pretty useless (Huge con for me..) The clock displays ONLY when you press and hold a button then it goes away.I do not understand how they thought displaying "Radio" or "AUX IN" was more important than displaying the clock.  and apparently some people have problems with the clock not saving it's time... so this was kind of a bust for me.. sort of useful and cheap but not quite what I was looking for..I give it 3 stars because it works pretty well as a new car stereo but i find it to be a bit poorly designed.. with the clock's function and the fact you have to HOLD the button to even view the clock.. its like a 30 second process just to see the time. Not to mention you have to do this while driving.. Should simply display the clock or have the ability to choose if you want the clock to always be displayed. Easy 5 stars if they would have simply made the clock/display more useful & functional.
5,worked great in 2006 Ford Focus daughter is happy. i had one extra blue wire for power antenna(??) not sure if it functioned. video "replacing burnout JVC with BOSS 616UAB Bluetooth receiver in less than 2 hours" can be found on youtube
5,I am very impressed with this unit. It installed easily in my 1979 MG MGB. It has a very small form factor that should allow installation basically anywhere.My only complaint and it really doesn’t matter much is that it tends to be a little loose a little floppy in its installation sleeve. I think that’s correctable so I’m not concerned.The display is easy to read. My iPhone connects quickly ( and automatically) when the unit powers on.And for what? Like $37?You can’t beat this.
3,Sound quality is ok for its price but as it says 50w x4 don’t expect even closer
3,Needed a new radio/bluetooth device but didn't want to spend a lot of money since the vehicle has 350k miles on the odometer.The many highly rated reviews for this product and the $30 pricetag made me take the plunge.The unit is pretty bare bones with simple buttons which I like. So many car stereo units on the market have obnoxious designs and light up like an airplane cockpit.I was excited to program my most listened to radio stations only to discover this unit does not pick them up. These are major stations in a major metro area. Guess will have to stream using bluetooth.The unit doesn't put out the greatest audio quality compared to the Sony system that this unit replaced so if you're looking for awesome sound you may be disappointed.I would consider this a "you get what you pay for" budget bare-bones unit that takes care of your bluetooth needs and will play music from your phone and a couple of radio stations.
3,Great sound easy to operate but the built in mic for hands free calling is horrible.
5,Bought this to replace an OEM radio from a 1994 GMC truck.Much better sound quality than OEM radio that came with the truck.The bluetooth connects well but the internal mic is very poor. I can hear a caller well but callers cannot hear me... to the point that I no longer use the bluetooth for calls.The display is useless in daylight hours but... I am very pleased with the sound quality.
2,The sound quality it not the best but I guess you get what you pay for. Even with several pre-sets and adjustable EQ I can't get this thing to sound half way decent. I get it dialed in for music somewhat and then the talking is crazy bassy. Dial it in somewhat for voice and the music sounds like it's in a tin can. I gave up. The weirdest thing is the volume. It has numbers that appear on the screen when you turn the volume. You have to turn it past 9 to hear anything out of it (Okay I can get used to that). BUT it also seems to be possessed - if you turn the volume down to the point you can't hear it 8 or even all the way to zero like when you need to talk to someone and then turn the car off when you next start the car the stereo comes on at around 14 on the volume level. I thought I was tripping so I tried a few times and sure enough it always turns its self back up when you start the car.  That's a pretty good trick but annoying. I'll be looking for something to replace it with.
5,It was easy to install easy to use Bluetooth. Great value for great radio. I hooked it up to 2 boss chaos 5×7 & 2 boss riot 6×9.. sounds great
2,Spraker connector doesn't make contact so speakers dont always work. The connector is garbage. Called Boss for a new one and they tried telling me my speakers were bad. They work just fine the connector wasn't making contact when it was installed and locked. They cut me off I will find small connectors to fix it. Boss' customer service is terrible.
3,I installed this stereo in my Jeep XJ and so far I am satisfied. I use it mainly for FM radio and  phone calls over blue tooth. Here are my impressions after having it for six months:Pros:- Good FM reception.- The blue tooth connection works well. The audio track is paused when there is an incoming phone call. The stereo has buttons for picking up and hanging up the phone. The other parties can hear me well through the built in microphone.- Each input channel remembers the volume setting you last used. This allows for balancing the volume between difference sources.- The manual says it can randomly play MP3 from USB but I haven't tested this function yet.- I like the utilitarian look. Fits my utilitarian vehicle.Cons:- LED display showing equalizer bars and VW bug? Ugly.- Doesn't show the time when radio is on.- The blue LED display is bright and cannot be dimmed.- The body of the stereo is slightly thicker and  wider than the typical single DIN radio. I had to enlarge the dash opening accept the BOSS unit.Overall I give it four stars because it is great value for the money.Update: The clock has stopped and now it is always 8:50 in the car. I will continue using it as it is but knocked off one  star because of the quality.
5,Put this thing in my 72 super beetle. Fit great with a aftermarket backing plate. The cut out on the beetle was a lil wider than the stereo.
4,Install was easy. Sound is a lot better than I was expecting.  Only complaint is that is doesn't always connect for BT. Not sure if it's the stereo or phone though.  Worth the money
4,Installed this just for the Bluetooth connection.  Works great for that!  The sound quality is about the same as the factory two.  Installed this in a 2014 Jeep Patriot.  No fault of the radio but I had to tap into the lighter adapter for power.  Unfortunately  the Jeep does not have this in the wiring.  All in all great bargain if you're looking for a step up with great features for a low price.
4,The size bluetooth connection
1,Let me start off by telling you that I used to install and repair car stereos for a living.  -I’ve seen a lot.I’m just going to make you a list of the reason you don’t want this frustrating POS:1)  The display is horribly dim.  The “Bright” setting makes it just okay for seeing at night. And in the daytime this is impossible to see without shading it with one hand first.  Good luck doing this while driving.  BOSS cheaped out and used only one LED to light the entire display.  So the light is literally spread too thin.2)  This unit loses all of its settings randomly.  Station settings tone settings clock ALL forgotten randomly.  Per 1) above the display forgets it was on High and returns to Medium for even more fun in taking your eyes off the road to reset everything...  It can go for days remembering settings then POOF like magic -they're all GONE!  (And yes my power connections are good.)3) Its MP3 player has a really annoying bug:  It won’t play the first second or so of any song (file) it plays.  So it messes with your head for the start of every song.  Was this intentional?  God I hate this.4)  See what looks like a bar graph equalizer display that shows you what the sound is doing?  That's a big NOPE for this unit.  It just bounces around randomly independent of ANY sound.  Think of this as a daily visual reminder of how stupid you were to buy this units even after I warned you...These problems are so bad that I wouldn’t recommend not only this model but I would stay away from anything BOSS as well.  Clearly they have bad design judgement  Just move on.  Save yourself the frustration.  Trust me on this.
4,Was looking for a replacement radio for our 97 Accord and this caught my eye. Covered all the basics and had some features that were unexpected at this price point. Installation took me about 2 hours splicing each wire with the help of online schematics and a call to the Techs at Boss to clarify the last 2 power connections. Answers from the tech staff were right on the mark and the install has been a success. Have already been very impressed with the BT connectivity and hands free calling feature.The sound quality produced by this unit is adequate but may not be suitable for those hoping to be wowed by the sound.The only issue I have to date is how sensitive the dial and buttons were on the initial setup. It took some time to work through the menus and get the time and date properly setup.All in all a good purchase that I would recommend to others. May update the review as time passes to see about this units reliability.
4,I bought this head unit because it was the least “flashy” one I could find under $50. It doesn’t disappoint on this front but I wish the screen was brighter and less reflective. It is impossible to read the display when wearing sunglasses during the day. I also wish it had the ability to automatically dim when the interior lights are turned on like most radios at this price do. My only other complaint is that the clock doesn’t display when playing music over Bluetooth. I feel that they could have done a little more research into what customers wanted from a radio. Great radio for the money especially with the Bluetooth even if trying to connect is finicky at times.
4,it does what its supposed to do. there is no actual equalizer. you can use the presets that come with it I guess.  You get what you pay for. I will probably change it out for something better sooner than later. It works better than my broken Kenwood I had in before.
5,Great head unit with bluetooth and built in 200 watt Amp. With the addition of new speakers and this head unit it made my old 1994 Lincoln Town car sound experience come to life again.The remote is super handy and the speaker phone function is actually better call quality than an ear piece. I was shocked!Tip: if you really want to drive your speakers turn on the LOUD function 1st THEN adjust the bass and treble settings to your liking.This unit is actually better than some of the Kenwood and Sony systems I have had in the past at half the price! Enjoy!
2,Deja de funcionar el control de volumen
4,Not super expensive. Output isn’t great unless you’re just using it for pre outs to amps
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I think its worth the price ive had it for about 2months and it works good but its not too loud but  it could also be my speakers
5,This is not a "just purchased" review. I purchased and installed this radio in my work truck that I drive daily a little over a year ago and it has been rockin' hard ever since. Sure it's not high end by any stretch of the imagination but if all you're looking for is to replace an old no-longer-working stock radio like I was you can't go wrong here. Plus now I can copy my favorite music from iTunes onto an SD card and enjoy it while I'm on the road. And I absolutely LOVE the bluetooth capability. Initial pairing was simple and the unit quickly re-pairs every time I get back in. Being able to accept calls and talk completely hands free while the radio automatically pauses the music playing on the SD card is just fantastic. Installation was a breeze and took about two hours. I did some research to find the correct installation kit for my vehicle and ordered that as well. All in all I couldn't be happier with this radio. In fact if this one dies I will buy another - that's how much I like it.
4,Nothing to dislike works as it should sounds pretty good
5,installed in our pontoon boat. Fit just fine....was surprised this new one is much shallower and lighter than the original.....fitment was perfect. Remote operation appears to be IR not RF but it'll do just fine for the price.
3,Bought for resale
5,Actually really easy to install I'm a woman with no mechanic or car experience and I did it myself. Just make sure that your fuse is good! Haha. I bought an older Jeep a few years ago that already had an aftermarket CD player installed. The car lot could not find the removeable face for the CD player so I have been without a radio! So it was easy bc my car already has a wiring harness installed + dask kit that all worked for this radio too. Oh and for those who do not know what all the colored wires are either...this radio doesnt have an orange/white wire and my existing harness did. So I capped off the orange and it still worked fine. I also had a blue/white in the existing harness and blue connected to an amp that was removed so I just wrapped the blue from amp blue/white from wiring harness and the blue on this radio's harness altogether. Everything works fine. Overall happy with my radio and glad I'm not out a ton of money as I probably wont keep this car much longer. Will update if anything goes wrong! My car is a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
4,I'm very satisfied with this purchase I feel like I practically got a free nice stereo.sure there are way better stereos that you can buy for more money but at this price point I don't know what more you could expect.my last stereo was stolen this one will probably be stolen two but when it happens I'm just going to keep replacing it with this model because for the price you just can't beat it.I read some of the reviews that said that there's didn't work correctly once they wire them in but it seems to me that if you wire it the way you're supposed to while the power is turned off you should have no problems I don't know what they're talking about mine installed easily 20 minutes tops
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I believe this is the best radio you can buy for under $30.00 the sound quality is better than radios I have paid over $100.00 for the blue tooth pairs with my android phone instantly for hands-free while driving and actually works great! I put my whole CD collection on a small thumb drive along with all of my downloaded songs and did not even fill up a fraction of it the sound quality through this radio is phenomenal. I will never go back to CD’s or using my phone for playlist. This radio is only about 2-3 inches deep so you can get it into places that other radios will not fit. The first radio I received did have an intermittent problem but I contacted the vendor and they promptly sent me a replacement(no questions ask) **I would recommend this radio; I would also recommend the installation kit “It’s a $7.00 easy button)  ****Up date; from time to time the digital screen will go crazy; just pull the radio fuse and let it reset the screen should be fine again for a while. I've been using the radio for a while now and other than having to pull the fuse a couple of times I still love it for the cost.**
5,Update 8/15/2021Beeping suddenly disappeared and worked as intended in our outdoor kitchen.1/22/22 Still continues to work and that strange beeping never returned after the summer of 2020. With a low price point replacing isn’t an issue if and when it does however satisifiwd that it continues to function.Quite simply this worked for about one month then all we receive is a beeping noise. This is for my outdoor entertainment pool area and the only way to stop the beeping is to turn the power off to it. Would not recommend.
5,Could not rate blue tooth or touch screen quality.  Put the radio in an antique truck just to have some music.  The sound quality is excellent!!
5,We needed a single din radio that had bluetooth connectivity for our camper van. Having already spent too much getting the van on the road we bought this as a cheap temporary solution. It is most definetly staying put. The power and ease of use is amazing for the price.
3,I’ve had this for slightly over a year and none of the buttons work anymore it’s stuck on Bluetooth but nothing can connect to it. So now I don’t have a way to play music through my phone (since the BT doesn’t work and I can’t switch it to aux) and I don’t have a radio. Luckily a broke down 10 minutes into a 3 hour drive...so that was funEdit: after reaching hearing back from boss I’m here to update this. My inital ticket with boss was closed prematurely however upon opening a 2nd ticket they got in contact with my within a couple days and helped me troubleshoot this explaining that if the first couple troubleshooting options didn’t work they would ship me a new one of these and I could return the old one. Luckily I was able to get this up and working again. All in all I had to get help jump starting my car once because the radio drained my battery but it works fine again and I know how to fix this if it starts acting up again.
5,I’ve had my dodge stratus for quite a while now but sadly it’s almost impossible to play music on the current stereo installed. I bought this with just the hopes of playing music through bluetooth and had my dad install it for me. So far the sound quality is good and I am also able to speak through the phone with others without the quality breaking up. The bluetooth connection is great and I’m glad that  I’ll be able to blast slipknot on the way to college now. :)
5,Nice and good
4,I havent really bought any audio decks in a while so this was a new buy. There are a couple things I like about it and there are a few  things I don't. Here they are:What I like:- It has a bright blue display which looks cool if you watch from outside the car- The bluetooth works great it syncs with my phone automatically as long as it in range- It has a remote- It has a USB port which doubles as a charger for my phoneWhat I dont like:- When you press the buttons on the deck its really clicky and it gives the impression of a poorly designed product- The display has no option to show the time by default so you need to press the DISP button to see the time which is annoyingOverall:You are getting great value for your money with this deck but dont expect any miracles.
5,Connects instantly phone works great.
5,Installation was simple enough took maybe half an hour. The sound quality is average you can manipulate the equalizer to your liking. By pressing in the volume knob there's an option to dim down the display light but overall its not very bright or intrusive.I have not had any issues or problems relating to the smell of a burning plastic as other(s) have mentioned. We'll see how it holds up after a year. My primary reason for purchasing this head unit was for the bluetooth capability and its pretty great! The automatic bluetooth connectivity seems strong and fast playing music from my phone wirelessly or listening to my Google Maps direction is very handy now that I can charge my iPhone 8 plus and not forfeit listening to Spotify or having to use those nonsensical audio dongles.Engaging in a phone call could be better but that may be a personal experience because the air vents in my car are close to my stereo. However the radio will dim down when you get a call or play a voice message of any kind which is handy.
1,At first everything was fine no issues. Now this radio seems to have become possessed. Sometimes it will call the last person I talked on the phone with. It will just call the person over and over again. The only way to stop it is to either shut the vehicle off or power off the phone. The radio will also start to randomly rotate between the AM radio to the FM radio to the Bluetooth set up. If I power off the radio it just decides to start itself up again.
1,This thing ONLY last 6 months! Got it for my semi truck so I wasn’t needing anything too pricey just something to listen to my jams on. The 5th month of having it all of my station presets started to mess up (if I hit 1 for the set station it’ll change to the station I have set for 6 or something). Now the 6th month this thing has went completely out. The only thing I’m able to do is connect to the Bluetooth and that quality is CRAPPY now. Just spend a few more dollars and get a better quality radio.
4,Solid for the price bluetooth is usually on point no real issues there other than minor hiccups. Sound quality is a little disappointing this is partially due to my cars stock speakers but more due to the head unit pushing a good bit of bass out of the box. I was able to correct it by lowering the bass levels and letting the subwoofer make up the difference but your results may be wildly different than mine.
4,Great features and great price. Ive only had it for a month so hopefully it will last a long time.Bluetooth works great. Charging is a bit slow. Not the loudest but great for my food cart
5,I have not put it in my truck yet.But I am surely going to love cause I can play the music I want hear like 506070&80 music off my phone
5,Good and very easy to use. Only down side is microphone is not that good while connected to bluetooth apart from that great.
5,Ever since installing this it has worked great in our Toyota highlander. The Bluetooth is reliable and the audio is great. I would recommend this product for anyone looking to get a reliable basic after market radio for their car.
1,I knew going into this that the unit was a low priced one. Wired it up in my '73 VW and was impressed by the sound especially on AM. But then driving down the road it just cut off everything reset the clock preset stations all of my settings. Checked my wiring it appeared good but it continued to do it with no rhyme or reason. Pulled this unit out and put my old one back in it worked fine so I know it's not my wiring. I used Wago lever nuts so switching is quick and easy had replaced the old unit due to a malfunctioning volume knob. Unfortunately I didn't get around to installing the Boss unit for a while and the return window closed. So I'm stuck with it.
5,This little head unit is simple straightforward and all you need for a basic single-din application. FM radio aux in and Bluetooth for such a low cost is beautiful. Great sound quality easy to pair - perfect. I put this into a 2013 Ford F-150 and the dash kit cost more than the radio. Because Ford is stupid I had to find power to actually get the radio to work but that's a Ford failure but at least they circle (or rather oval) their mistakes on the assembly line. But I digress...
5,I bought this stereo for my 1997 Chevy Suburban. I just installed it today but so far its awesome! What a great buy. I used the wiring harness kit and the dash din(all bought on Amazon) and everything worked great. The stereo sinked right up to my phone. I also set up the channels and so far its great.
5,Definitely would recommend for the price does as described connects Bluetooth auto and at a good speed among start of vehicle.
5,Paired easily. Install was easy.Put it in a little Ranger so not a big space to fill sound wise but it did the trick. Factory speakers sound good lots of tone adjustments available.Controls are a learning curve remote actually comes in handy until I got the hang of it.Paid $35 bucks returned a 150 Kenwood to see how this works. They looked and felt so similar.So far so good. Can't beat the price.Not super bright like some reviews kept saying.
2,The unit plays my music and tunes radio stations. IT plays from my phone just fine but if I'm in a call the other person hears me as though I was speaking from across the room and under a blanket. I tested it with a couple phones to make sure it wasn't just me and my phone. So making a call is pointless. Since there's no option for an external mic there's nothing that can be done to improve it. Otherwise it's cheap plays music and lets you hear someone talk to you over the phone. They can't hear you but one side of a conversation is better than no sides.
5,Well worth the price. HUGE sound for a little price. Easy to hook up and the hubby loves it
5,If it last its a nice radio for the money.
5,I purchased this Boss 616UAB not for the price point but for its form factor (the design). Its design is refreshing with and enlarged volume rocker and rectangular compact screen will give your dashboard a premium feel.Sound quality is excellent however it do lack multiple presets for audio in that there are no more than flat rock and pop however the preset rock will work great in tandem with four door speakers.(you can balance speakers and loud off/on etc)There is auto illumination but you can manually adjust it if you  find its too bright at night.The builtin  mic is excellent and sounds great on the receivers end.Bluetooth connects instantly once your phone bluetooth is on and the CAR ACC is on.In conclusion for the price you get a premium compact design with great sound quality. I would buy this again if needs be .
4,It's ok for the price. Bluetooth works great. The usb charges some phones others not. There is no way to dim the backlight. And you cant see the clock unless its turned off. Other than that it's a good buy for the price. Would recommend updated review. I bought another one of these for a second car to confirm there seems to be a problem with the wiring and both units to where the clock resets to 12 a.m. when the engine is turned off I checked both ACC and Battery wires to confirm this seems to be a software issue other than this it's great value for the money
5,I was looking for a simple lightweight unit with B-tooth. This works very well takes little space as there is no CD and B-tooth quickly connects to phone. Sound is good for me and my 1975 C3
4,It works if a little on the weak side but for the price it does great. I put it in a Jeep that I am building so I didn't want anything real fancy no complaints at this point.
5,Installed this in my 1995 camaro it works really good I haven’t had any issues with it and the controller really makes it easy to adjust the settings
1,tl;dr: I realize buying a $40 radio is a bit of a gamble as far as quality goes but this unit is pure junk.I bought this unit to replace the factory AM/FM radio in my older Chevy Express work van. Since this isn't a hot rod my feature list consisted of : A) turns on B) connects to my phone and C) makes the phone noise come out of the vehicle speakers. After Installing everything worked as advertised and I had the unit installed and working within an hour. Success! I can finally listen to my music while in my work van. I drove around the rest of that day happily playing music from my phone via bluetooth. Audio wasn't great paired with the 8 ohm factory one-way speakers it was tinny and the volume has to be bumped to max to get it to play at a moderate volume. That all improved once I installed decent quality 4 ohm two-way speakers. EQ is 2 band bass/treble so tuning is very limited and I found it tough to get a decent balance of sound.It worked for about two or three days before a fairly quick descent into total failure. One night coming home the audio completely cut out. I tried adjusting the volume but nothing silence. I switched sources in an attempt to debug the problem but it appears the radio amplifier had quit. I left the volume on low and waited to see if the audio would come back in the hope that unit overheated. After about 15-20 minutes the audio came back. Maybe it is overheating? The next day it worked on one commute for an hour but the next commute the audio started to crackle before cutting out after just five minutes. I shut it off for the rest of the day in frustration and left it alone. The next day I tried testing everything to make sure there wasn't a speaker problem but the display became corrupted and displayed random garbage while flickering. Then it completely died leaving me with only the lighting and no display or audio. Getting my money back for this lemon.
4,Only stereo I have ever seen that needs the remote to be able to change the eq balance fader or anything more complex than the source audio or volume
5,Wanted a cheep radio for my jeep and this one is perfect. Bluetooth connect vary fast. For the money can't beat it
5,Was just going to reorder 616uab amazon says I have purchased this item 3 times before and I havenothing but good to say about them. Have installed these in tractors and my daily driver the one in my truck about every three to four months gets a hiccup and won’t turn off or adjust volume push the reset button and good again. Lots of bad reviews but 3 of this model and a handful of other models by BOSS. I can’t complain cheap music in rough dirty environments KenwoodAlpine or Pioneer don’t seem to last any longer in my equipment. Gonna order 2 or three more now because I like to have the ready to go in when I get another old farm truck or tractor.Been really good for my 30 bucks
5,Simple 12 volt dc radio works as advertised.
4,Install was a bit of the pain to fit on one side of the car radio brackets with din kit compared to another radio I purchased but I prefer this simple display and it picked up signals better than similar priced radio available on Amazon. The bluetooth works well enough.  It connects faster the some newer model car stock radios. I would hiu again
5,Bought a cheap deck because the truck won’t lock. Was really surprised in the quality of this cheap little deck
2,I bought this to have a cheap fix for my daily driver. It does work but every couple days the Bluetooth goes into pairing mode on the head unit and the unit has to be removed and unplugged then plugged back in for it to clear and connect to the phone again.
5,Great product for the price. I've had it for a couple of months and have had zero issues so far.
4,for the price this does exactly what it's supposed to do.  the blue tooth feature works good and is very consistent.  But the display is very simple.  when your phone is connected all you see is a 4 digit code.  it doesn't tell you the time or what song is playing.  And the lights that move with the beat of the music are horrible!!  I colored it in with a black paint marker because it is too distracting while driving at night.  If I had to do it over again I would spend more money and get a better one.  but you can't beat the price and the thing does work so you can't really fault it.  I just want more features next time.
4,I'm almost convinced that lower end and higher end technology has come together. I was sceptical because of the price  but this stereo is awesome.  It looks nice the bluetooth connects very fast and the sound quality is super.  Pretend like you're paying $200 more and buy this!The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that in bright sun the display is hard to see.
4,Works well for the money you can tell it’s not a high quality unit
5,My last car radio was stolen so i just wanted an inexpensive replacement in case it happened again. I was pleasantly surprised how well it performs for the price. If your looking for a basic car stereo without all the overrated bells and whistles this is a very good fit.I definitely would recommend this brand.
5,We bought one of these to replace a junk radio in a 1996 Isuzu Hombre we bought. It's no nonsense and simple to use. The speakers in the truck are old and not great but this radio does well at delivering as clear of a sound as possible. We liked it enough to buy 2 more of these. One for our big old 1993 GMC Sierra and one for our 1984 VW Rabbit. Bluetooth is quick and pairs to our phones every time. Hard to beat this for the price.
5,Hooked it up in 20 minutes and it is definitely worth the money. Very happy and no problems so far!
4,Yes it works. Havnt tried a phone call yet.But everything else works as it should..My only issue there is no sub control.There is a LOUD ON option. But better thennothing. The radio is small.. Fits really anywhere.FM / AM works fine. Bluetooth music works perfect.Havnt tried the AUX / CHIP yet. Have no need..But it comes with a remote.. It dont work out side thevehicle like old school ones. But it all works for under $50.
5,Installed on my 2021 kenworth track without any problem. Works great. volume up down not works from from steering weel but is not big problem.
5,It’s actually a really good stereo for the price I paid. Good sound quality.
4,Great value.  Wiring is very thin gage.  Wish off/on button didn't require holding down button for seconds to turn off.  Sometimes requires powering off (hard reset) when switching between different blue tooth devices; locking up the radio.  Otherwise it works great after about a year and a half of use.
5,I chose this based on price and features.  This will be my first Boss Audio product.  I installed it about a week ago and there were no issues there.  I use an amplifier and this head unit does not offer dedicated sub outputs - so be aware.  There are front and rear speaker outs so it's not really an issue.  There is no clearly labeled remote turn on wire.Wires are easy color coded and pre-cut so you don't have to worry about stripping them.The interface is simple and pairs quickly.  All I wanted was BT and it works perfectly.  There are Bass and Treble settings as well as a loud and some presets.  You have three choices for illumination levels.  At medium the blue matches the gauges on my 14 F150.Overall I like it.  Quality is good buttons feel substantial and it works every time.
5,my iphone connects easily. Sound quality seems good so far.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I'm really picking when it comes to my car audio but this was for a budget  project  and I truly say I'm really impressed with  the bluethooth connectivity and the sound quality  it was hooked up to 2 skars 3.5s rated at 40 rms and the little raido was taking like a champ  if you're looking for a and good quality radio  this is it!!! Hooked it up on my 1983 dodge diplomat
5,Pros:  Good fit & finish.  Hardware wiring etc. were of decent quality.  Installation and setup were a breeze.  (I chose to purchase a wiring harness that was fit for my vehicle. It's about 5 dollars more (from multiple sellers). It saves time and retains the original wiring.)  At first I was a little disappointed with the sound quality. I played several mp3 files thru the usb port and the quality was what I'd call radio-level.  Not bad just nothing to crow about.  I then connected my phone via bluetooth and streamed some (quality) music via Amazon.  Sounded great!  It's about the quality going in. Good reproduction of what you send to it.  I haven't tested the line-in feature. (3.5mm jack)Cons:  Nothing substantial...I'm not a fan of the animated display (simulated EQ bar graph) but that's just me.Overall- Good price good quality good features. I would recommend
5,Great product  for the price I got this for my father in law truck and easy to operate
5,The Product seems to be of a much Higher quality then others in this price range. Crisp clear sound and Sub ready. I didn't add a sub yet my four 150 watt speakers handle everything this radio can throw and remain clear. Sub will be added. My last purchase(SSL not this Brand) died in 6 days of use so i gave this is 5 stars for now and the older the review is means its still working.
1,I purchased three of these for three different vehicles installed the first one in my 2000 Dodge ram went out of town it died within the first two hours of my weeklong trip. Very frustrating. Came back already had another one installed it and sent the bad unit back for a refund I also installed one and a 2000 Tacoma. Both units behave the same and have a mind of their own. Different volumes for different functions is a nuisance the USB starts over from the beginning each time the Bluetooth mic is crap and the unit turns on automatically  frequently. The worst thing is when a Bluetooth call comes in or you’re listening to Bluetooth music like Pandora you have to turn the volume up so high and then when the call is over or you switch back to radio USB or a AUX the sound level can be damaging. I hate these and now i hav 2 installed i do not want. I don’t know if any of the newer boss units have overcome these issues but now i am stuck.
5,For $36 this radio is the best bang for your buck around. The Bluetooth works amazing and so does the radio it self. Never had any connectivity issues after using for over 2 months now. I can’t say it enough for $36 this radio is everything you pay for and more. (Just keep in mind you’re only paying $36 for a Bluetooth head unit; which is WAY cheaper than anything else on the market)
5,This thing works like a charm. The stereo needed to be replaced in my 16 year old truck. I wasn’t looking for a top of the line model. My husband installed it with little trouble. It took me about 5 minutes fiddling with the sound on the head unit and on my phone to get it right and I’ve never had to touch it again. It links automatically and works great! The only thing I dislike is that it’ll start playing my music immediately even if I wasn’t already playing it on my phone. But that’s not a huge deal and for the price I’m thoroughly pleased. I’ve seen several expensive units not work this well including built in Bluetooth units (my husbands van). I definitely recommend this unit!
5,Can’t beat the price and super easy install with the harness
2,Lasted only 2wks had to return it
5,For the price this deck unit operates excellent. Sounds good. The blue tooth signal also works great and is easy to use.
3,I bought this receiver because it has so many reviews (6700+); however I don't understand why so many are 5-star.  There are only two Pro's: 1) relatively cheap price (but there are plenty other car receivers with even lower price) and 2) it has a remote control.  However my biggest complaints about this model are: 1) it has TERRIBLE radio reception with a low-quality AM/FM tuner (even with an excellent antenna local stations are scratchy) 2) the silly bar graph on the bottom of the display is just for show it doesn't follow music at all.  It is a waste of display landscape for sure.
4,It's a good cheap radio you definitely get your money's worth. Everything seems to work OK but you have to rember it's a $25 dollar radio not a $200 or $300. The remote control is junk very thin and you have to squeeze it very hard for the buttons to work. But the bluetooth works great
3,The connector wires are very thin like possibly 24 guage. I got my proper connecters to wire up to my factory harness but everytime I shut vehicle off it totally resets the radio. So any radio stations that I save are erased and also I have to adjust bass treble and all back to how I like it.I got it for the Bluetooth and it connects up really fast.Really like this unit but I'm returning it because I'm not going to set my audio settings everytime I drive my vehicle.My vehicle: 99 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer with factory amp and sub. Sub worked but mine I think is blown so at higher volumes it sounded like gunshots
4,Works great! The sound quality is superior to the OEM radio from the 90’s BUT the screen is insanely dim even on the brightest setting it’s barely visible during the day if visible at all it doesn’t even display the time but at this price point who really cares?
2,Radio will not power up and only had it 6 months. Wants $35 for shipping fees. No way!!
4,Take a while to install but works great.
4,I love my radio over all it just sucks that it doesn't come with a CD player. Walmart brand burned out after month on the first one & four days after buying a second one.
3,If you are planning to use this to read mp3 from a thumb drive be aware that the first seconds of every single track are missing. It begins each track like 2 seconds in. I can find no setting to change this. Also periodically it will just forget there's a thumb drive making you reinsert it and start from 1st folder again which is a huge pain if you have 100 + folders. Also you can only choose folders in a + 1 manner. Meaning you can't just scroll through folders but have to cycle through each folder one at a time- the button needs to be held for about 1 second to get to next folder. Otherwise fine lol
3,For what you pay this BOSS 616UAB system is okay. The sound quality is better than I expected whether using the Bluetooth option radio or USB. Installation was pretty straight forward although the actual instruction sheet is pretty much worthless.My biggest complaint is the visuals. The blue lighting of the display panel makes it worthless. It can't be seen during the daylight hours rendering the display useless. The clock function may as well not be included as it WILL NOT hold the time at all. After many attempts I have not been able to work this out. When the vehicle is shut off there goes the clock function. That combined with the worthless display...I don't even look at the radio for the time.
4,I have a 1998 Honda Accord that I use as my commuter car and wanted a radio with Bluetooth to connect my phone. This was a great choice! Easy to install. Bluetooth works great and really good sound quality! The remote works great too. The only downside is the display is very hard to see during daylight (even on brightest setting).
5,I wanted a little stereo for my garage and this thing is perfect.  It puts out good sound and bluetooth connectivity has range throughout the entire garage.  What more could you ask from a $30 stereo???  The only drawback I found was hooking up my iPod touch nano it will charge but not play or control from the USB port.  I ended up running an AUX cable and charge it from a separate USB power supply.  I mostly stream Spotify or Pandora from my phone anyways so this wasn't a deal breaker.
5,Simple install. Works great.
4,Good unit for the cash but it's had to see in the day time even with the illustrations set to the Brightest but all in all worth the money
4,Works well connects quickly after initial pairing. Max backlight setting is pretty dim for daytime. Pressing the large button quickly does enter settings menus instead of powering on and off. It has caused me to change settings when I just want the unit off. Way better than i expected for the price.
1,Unit was easy to install but the features did not work correctly. The unit would come on even after it was powered off. The mode button would continually change from auxiliary to AM/FM to Bluetooth randomly. I never energized the remote control I only used Bluetooth. The unit was cheap so I trashed it and bought another of a different brand.
5,Someone stole the remote !
5,Totally worth it
3,Navigation of the SD/USB is pretty uncomfortable. You have next/prev track buttons +10/-10 track buttons that's all for single-click. The next/prev folder commads are done by long-pressing the +10/-10 buttons so navigating to a relatively distant folder is hard. It's hard to understand why they would put a dedicated button to "intro scan" or "repeat" instead of folder +/-.The screen is quite small which one can tell from the pic but on top of this the bottom part is completely wasted. What you see in the pic is not optional it is all the bottom half can do. The graph portraited as a spectrum analyzer is surprisingly unrelated to sound frequency it is essentially a vu-meter with a predefined curve. The constant picture of a car in the middle is even more useless. Bottom line: the entire screen can only show 7 characters at a time so that compounds to the navigation buttons issue.I am pretty sure it does not play the first fraction of a second of at least some of my mp3 files. This is only noticeable on tracks that have audible music immediately of course.These issues are what earn it this mediocre rating. Other aspects are decent.
1,Great looking radio Sounded OK Lacking fidelity no bass.  Stopped working after a month.  Don't think I can return it since I don't have any packaging.  Reached out to Boss and they said they would get back to me nothing yet.  I'm going to stick with Pioneer in the future.
1,It’s a basic digital media received (no cd). It’s a great replacement for an old aftermarket deck but I don’t know if it’s worth buying an install kit and adapter for. There is no real menu but a few different options you can comb through. Setting the clock is difficult and overall leaves a lot to be desired. The display is not very bright during the day even at its highest setting. Also if your radio is at an angle at all the display become even more difficult to read. The color is blue and can it be changed. It’s not bad for the money but we’re only talking $30 more bucks and you gm could have an awesome JVC or Kenwood which I HIGHLY recommend. A big plus for me is the flat black appearance to match with my cheap Honda interior it doesn’t look worth stealing and the Bluetooth pairs instantly and playback when you start the car is almost instant as wellUpdate:After 4 months of ownership and only two of use the unit is completely useless. The top edge has melted from being exposed to indirect sunlight (despite the previous Alpine stereo having no physical issues in the last 17 years) and there’s no speaker output at all. Since I’m outside amazon’s 30 day return window I checked out Boss’ policy; also 30 days (no surprise there) and their 1 year repair policy covers manufacturer defects but the shipping to/from costs are on the owner. I don’t see shipping charges being but a few dollars less than what I paid for it. That must be how they get out of owning up to their terrible terrible products.
5,So far so good. I had placed a pioneer in my Jeep which only lasted about three and a half weeks before it started having issues with the volume controls. Pioneer wasn't willing to do anything for me and neither did the Walmart where I purchased the radio at. I have bought boss equipment before and had good luck with it. I guess I should have stayed with what I know.
4,As it should be
3,This car stereo exceeded all of my expectations. True those expectations were super low due to how inexpensive this is. But my goodness it was nice to get a good surprise for a change.But then came the bad surprise: one night we started the car and the blue lights came on but the stereo did not. It wouldn't turn on. It wouldn't turn off. And when the car sat for a day it drained the battery dry.Which fixed it. It needed to have the power cut completely in order to reset. Your mileage may vary but for me that's a nonstarter. Get it? The husband thinks it's no big deal at least not worth replacing until it quits entirely. He's the installer so he wins.The sound is perfectly serviceable. It gets loud and all frequencies are clear. Bluetooth connection works great though my husband prefers aux in for sound quality (Mr. Ears). It was an easy install in my 2004 Odyssey EX (I bought a wiring harness and a frame kit). Still I would not buy it again.Three and a half stars.
3,Installed in a John deere cab but the frequency numbers are very difficult to see during the day.
1,Installed this in my semi truck adjusted the eq and volume settings to my desired listening and 2 seconds it went black. No power! I checked the fuse its not blown. I didn't even get to remove the plastic protective covering from the display screen. Trash I don't even want another one. I got what paid for!
5,Very nice radio for the truck
2,I purchased this for an inexpensive radio for my truck. Within 2 months the digital clock failed then within a year and 1/2 the lights went so dim on the system the only time I was able to make any adjustments was on a dark night and thirdly the Bluetooth was very sporadic.
4,Much better than expected for that price. Bluetooth works great The FM receiver is better than many. And even the sound is very good. Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the somewhat dim display but its not a real issue.
4,One Star. Product stopped working after almost two months of regular use.Update 6/26/18: I contacted the seller (Speece Inc) who advised me to reset it now it's working properly. Here are the instructions they gave me in case someone else encounters a similar issue:First you want to take a small object like a paperclip or so. Make sure you have power going to the unit.Press and hold the reset button for 15 to 20 seconds. This will turn your radio off.It may turn your radio back on but in the event it does not please press the power button.Remember this is a factory reset so it will reset any preset you had on the radio.
5,Excellent
4,it does what it says it does
1,The stereo seesm to have entered into this bizzare mode where the clock display flashes non-stop. It receives power the clock display is visible and the lights are on however none of the buttons seem to work neither does the remote this means; I can't access any of the units functions i.e radio bluetooth aux . Ive consulted the manual nothing even slightly resembling this issue is on there . I also made an effort to contact the manufacturer no response yet as of writing this review.
5,Works great easy install a great upgrade for my truck
4,good stereo for the money
3,Thought it would have more wattage and be loader but what do you expect for under 40 bucks
5,Great sound for the price very easy install and it's mad in the 🇺🇸 USA
4,Bluetooth is not the greatest! Has a wind like sound on the other side of the phone call!
4,Great little starter head unit for the price my only grip was there are no fader/balance settings to be found in this model so testing speakers the basic way isn’t gonna cut it.
4,It doesn't have a clock. If you want to see the time you have to press and hold a button and it will show for a few seconds. Even then it keeps resetting to 12:00 so I just forget about it. Other than that it's a great value Bluetooth upgrade for an old car. I like that it's simple and doesn't have a million useless options.
5,Installed it in like 30 minutes works exactly like it says. Decent power good sound super easy bluetooth works with my iphone 11 pro max without ANY hitch whatsoever. And people say my calls sound good. So really what's not to like? So far I couldn't be happier. For the price? get out of here it's a lock.
4,I bought this a few months back and it’s still working great. I use mine primarily for the Bluetooth feature which works great. I’ll get into the car and get automaticlly connected. You can adjust some of the sounds to make it sound better but unfortunately the settings always seem to reset. Ive seen other people on here with the same issue. It’s not the worst thing ever but does become annoying when you are on the go from place to place and have to adjust them back after you turn the car back on. Overall it’s a nice stereo. The blue light it gives off is very bright and it fit perfectly in my car.
4,The graphic equalizer screen is fake the bars just randomly move. Kind of lame in 2021 oh well. Otherwise pretty good
4,For the price this is a great deal. The illumination is a nice blue with 3 brightness settings. Easy to navigate once you get used to the order. Bluetooth works amazingly well. I never have to reconnect my phone or restart the audio player on it. The only thing I dont like is that it doesn't default to the time. You have choose it on the deck or push a button on the remote and when the clock is displayed there's no volume control. But for the price it is a minor inconvenience. Also the deck is shallow and is very lightweight. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone on a budget.
5,I bought it for the size.The radio I took out had a CD player and was to long to fit back in after I put a new wiper motor in.I find now that I don't need theCD player because the BOSS has a USB port and I can play all of my music from a memory stick.Great addition to my streetrod!!!
5,Very good radio excellent for the price recommending and the best thing it has is bluetooth.
4,It’s a pretty easy set up. The only issue I have is that it’s not bright enough to read when your ok the road during the day.
1,I bought this stereo about two years ago. It was fine for the price. The sound quality is meh and the bluetooth is meh. From a usability standpoint it was next to worthless. The different categories of input have seemingly no bearing on what they actually do and turning the volume knob not only does not always change the volume the same amount every time but sometimes it would simply change the volume in the opposite direction that you intended. The maximum volume is 43 which I find to be a crime in itself.None of that matters compared to this stereo's final day. Today while driving on the highway it decidedly removed itself from my life. While driving about 70 with music playing at a pretty low volume smoke started coming out along the edges. I pulled the unit out and through the vent grates I could see actual flames burning inside of it. I was able to unplug it and after that the smoke slowly went away. You can't see the flames in the picture but you can see the smoke. It was pretty gnarly.I feel pretty lucky that I was able to be calm enough to unplug it rather than jumping out and letting my car erupt in flames. I sincerely hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. For the love of god. Do not buy this.
4,For the price it does the trick. It should come with an antenna adapter.
1,You get what you pay for. I was reading mixed comments but went for it due to it being so cheap.Worked great for about a month. Then one day I turned the truck off and the unit stayed on but completely frozen. No matter what I did it wouldn’t turn off. Had to disconnect the battery to turn it off. When I drove again it seemed fine until it did it again a week later. I decided to install a kill switch in the power line so I could quickly reset it when it froze again. Which was okay for a little while. But now it will randomly cut the audio out and give a high pitch sound from the speakers. Again frozen so the kill switch to reset it. On top of all this now let’s talk about the Bluetooth. Connects effortlessly about 30% of the time. It requires me to forget device and then search for it almost every time. Then if that doesn't work I need to reset it with the kill switch and find device etc. until eventually it links. So most of the time I’m halfway to work before it finally connects.  It’s probably just bad quality assurance. You might get a good one you might get a bad one. 35 bucks to test your luck. I got a bad one. I will throw this away.
4,Sounds great. Fit wellIt forgets the sound settings all the time. When you get in the volume is at 13 and the base treble etc need to be reset. No issues with channel memory
1,This Sucks. A brand new radio. And it eats up my speakers by literally burning them to death with a good fire hazard included .I hate to write a negative review. But this thing really upset me. Only bought it a few months . Ago. And it burnt up/ toasted 2 of my best speakers!  Worked great for a few months. And I never maxed out the volume. Not even listen at a high volume. . Then one morning my speakers started popping when I would turn the radio off. I then turned the radio back on & the sound quality was terrible!.  . About 20 minutes later. My speaker Literally went up in Smoke!!  I panicked thinking there was a fire starting behind it . As I smelt the burning glue of the speaker. . The magnet of the speaker was extremely hot to the touch! . I put a new speaker in its place thinking that it was just that.  And with in a matter of seconds that speaker started getting hot! .I swap in different radio unit. but using the same wiring harness. in Hope's to trouble shoot the problem. Not wanting to accept the possibility that a brand new radio could do this.  But sure enough. . The radio I swapped in to test sounded great . And no over heating speakers. And no "popping" when I turn the swapped radio off.Extreme disappointment. And would like my money back along with with compensation for the 2 destroyed speakers . And nearly starting a fire in my RV!
3,Installed easy and works perfectly. Sound quality is good Bluetooth was easy to set up and works well. It’s not very powerful (loud) though and is actually hard to hear at highway speeds with any windows down. Volume stops at 43 which seems strange to me as well. It is a cheap radio though so I guess none of these issues are really deal breakers.
1,I thought I had an electrical problem in my car that I was trying to chase but it was actually the radio that was bad what a waste of time and money worked for 1 day
2,When I first got it I like the look of it but when you turn the radio on the sound quality if muffled. The unit itself does not keep memory every so often you lose all your preset stations and the clock never keeps accurate time. The usb connection works good but if you leave thumb drive plugged in it will default back to no memory. Sometimes the unit gets stuck between radio and linking to another device.  Bluetooth connection works good. I'm not sure if this was a bad unit but I'm considering a different radio unit.
5,I installed this in a 99 Jeep Wrangler that never gets locked and has an open top. Really needed something cheap just in case it gets stolen. For under $30 I get bluetooth and can hear music I like it for what it is(Cheap). If I had a locking vehicle I probably would have gotten something better but will buy this again if needed for my Jeep. Unable to speak about sound quality as my current speakers are near potato quality.
2,Cool an cheap media player while they work.  I got two of them and both stopped working after a month or two.  Maybe if you buy you will get one that will last longer......
4,1. For me. Everything ok with this one except the bluetooth for handsfree.It is easy to pairing to our smarphone. Just open our phone bluetooth and search. So it will pairing.We can hear other party sounds well from speaker but what we talk other party hear lots of noise and barely to understand us if we are putting phone such in a lap. We have to hold phone very near but then they also hear lot of noisy.This is what I a bit disapointed.2. EQ it has 4 preset and can set it manually.3. Bass quite deep. It has range -7 to 7 and also it has loud OFF and loud ON. It working good especially in FM mode. You can totally spot the different.
5,Worked good for what I used it for good deal
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Put this in my golf cart. Pushes two 6.5 marine kickers pretty well. Am/fm radio seems to work good Bluetooth has a range of about 15 feet or so and has enough settings for my use.  Blue lights matched my cart theme. Id recommend it for the price point.
5,no tiene pantalla táctil
2,UPDATE. not quite a year and it will not  switch from bluetooth back to radio. Guess it’s time to tear my dash apart and replace it with something that actually works.  it’s been a steady downhill ride since installation  Last time I will ever buy an unknown brand car radio.  UPDATE:  after about 2 months I was plagued by the display problems several others are having.  i really don’t want to tear my dash apart again so guess I will live with it.  was going to buy one for my motor home but will rethink that for sure!Bought this for a 20 year old Chevy truck to replace the factory cassette player model.  Getting the dash bezel off was kind of tricky mostly due to vehicle age and not wanting to break anything.  Had already replaced the four speakers.  Purchased the appropriate wiring harness.  Also purchased an antenna connector which I was advised was necessary for my model.  I did the connections on my workbench prior to installation.  Then it was simply a plug and play item!  My iphone synced with no problem and now I can enjoy Pandora etc. in my truck.  With the connectors speakers dash kit and this unit my total upgrade cost was about $75. and it sounds fantastic!  It was my 65th birthday present to myself and I was happy to complete the installation all by myself!
1,This radio sounded good for about 3 months then started getting fuzzy which gradually worsened. Within a few days after the fuzziness started the radio just stopped working altogether. I would not even consider buying another BOSS radio. The return window on this unit was only 30 days.
4,It work and sounds really good
4,Put this in a 97 Corolla yesterday. Took the old brackets off the factory radio and with a lil homemade mods it fit right. By mods I mean found a screw that fit and put it in a hole in the side of the new radio. Good sound quality considering. I had also replaced the rear 6.5' speakers. The only thing I don't care for is that the clock does not stay on the main screen. The channel or input mode stays displayed. You have to switch to the clock which then automatically goes back to the channel. All in all not bad for $25+. Teens like the AUX and BT.
4,the directions supplied are unclear continuous power (+) must be connected to the yellow wire and switched power (+) ie on-off by  the vehicle key or auxiliary switch must be connected to the red power wire for the  unit to operate  properly
5,Im completely blown away with how good this $37 unit works its not a $200 alpine but for a decent radio and flawless phone connection  you cant beat the price I mean $37 REALLY!
5,At $29.99 I was expecting a $30 stereo and this is exactly what it is. The bluetooth connects fairly decent if you keep your phone close to the stereo. The aux function and port work fine. Sound quality is what you would expect. Better than stock stereo but distortion at higher volumes especially once you begin messing with the equalizer. Its extremely light weight compared to a stereo that has a cd player. Overall it is a solid investment if you just need a cheap and easy to install replacement for an older car. For my application i couldn't use the plastic surround around the faceplate but it fits a normal single din slot.
5,Super simple install and easy to use. If you’re looking for a head unit that isn’t cluttered with tons of buttons and menu options then this is for you! Nice and clean simple design.
5,I bought this system just so i could connect to my phone in the car. For the price its a great buy. Set up wasnt too difficult and setting my stations on the radio was pretty easy. The downside is the sound isnt that great but that could just be my car speakers. I usually end up turning the volume all the way up on my phone and then a bit on the radio. Also my phone automatically connects to the radio when i start my car. Its nice but the radio goes out temporarily when it connects. For the price and convenience and for what i wanted it to do it was a great buy!
4,The Bluetooth quality for playing music  from your phone is good. Although when using the Bluetooth to talk on the phone people have said they can't hear me or its muffled.
3,It didn't last
4,For some reason it doesn't display the time when you are not touching any buttons. It works really well. If you are looking for a simple stereo to use for bluetooth devices I recommend it. The SD CARD feature is nice also but unfortunately you it overrides all other sources when it is pushed in all the way. When it not in all the way the card still stays in place and doesn't fall out. I leave one there in case I forget my bluetooth device and don't want to listen to the radio.I found out the hard way that it is worth spending the extra $16 over a less reliable stereo like this one for $27https://www.amazon.com/Polarlander-Receiver-Bluetooth-Hands-free-Control/dp/B00X0QAUCY/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1471205956&sr=8-3-fkmr0&keywords=porlander+jsd-520
5,Well if you take out the lasers and motors then it should be cheap right? (CD PLAYER)I can crank this thing up and it gets so loud without distorting.  I was expecting that it would sound good which it does but was expecting it to start to distort.  My ears will bleed before it distorts.  This sounds better then the pioneer (160$) that I replaced.It is very simple and the design doesn't look like a space ship like all the other weird expensive ones.The only thing i wish it has was a orange dimmer wire.  You have to set the brightness by hand in the settings.  Also the two blue lights are very annoying i will paint over those or drill out the leds.
5,I have a car that falls in-between the years where cassettes were no longer stand but aux ports weren't really a thing yet. This wired in easy and fit into a double DINN adaptor I purchased. Audio quality seems better than stock and now I have bluetooth!I had problem a few weeks after it installed where it just wouldn't turn on. The blue light would turn on signifying it was getting power but it wouldn't ever do anything.  I thought the unit went bad but it turns out I just needed to press the reset button beneath the volume knob with a paperclip and it worked again. Still going strong after about a year!
5,For the price it was worth it. I have and old ford truck and needed a low cost radio in it no bumping music but it sounds alright. I like that it doesn't play cd's or cassette so have less stuff in the car. So far so good. I like the stereo!
4,Replacement for the one in my camper that went out in 6 months. Very affordable if it last 6 months I guess I got my money out of it. I just wanted a replacement that just plugged into the old wiring.
5,Nice stereo easy installeasy to use and the easiest I have ever synced my phone to a car stereo! Would put in any classic vehicle for great upgrade.
4,Was surprised how well it sounds “ just got it for the work truck but sounds like a 200 dollar radio !
5,Great band for your buck.
1,This is the worst radio I have ever installed! It continually scans radio channels without stopping shuts off and calls my last called phone number at will. Don’t waste your money or time! I purchased a Pioneer and all is good.
5,Got this for.my husband as a Christmas gift he love it has great sound
5,This product has the exact connections necessary to fit into any 1999-2004 Land Rover Discovery 2 without a harness. Seriously buy this item and avoid ten of hours of painful electrical diagrams. Cheapest radio on amazon and requires no additional harness. In order to install into your car you will need one item in addition and that is a little plastic piece in order to fill the slot under the aftermarket radio. That piece is called "Metra 89-9400." Make sure you order this part if you are doing a Land Rover install.
5,This was a replacement radio for in an older car.  It has lots of additional features that the old radio lacked including Bluetooth direct audio input  and USB charging port. It does everything it says it will do. I had to read the instruction book to  setup the functions (clock stations phone pairing etc) but the directions were fine. The "answer phone" feature works well and pairing with the phone is automatic after the initial setup. The display is somewhat difficult to see in bright daylight. The sound quality matches that of the old radio using the existing speakers.
4,I just installed it yesterday in my 2004 Jeep Liberty to replace the original broken stereo and it's a big surprise. It has enough power  good sound and great bluetooth connectivity.Excellent for its bargain price.
5,Installed in semi truck.  works great!
5,A really amazing piece of equipment for a very low price. The blue-tooth alone makes it so worth the money. I should mention that the microphone is not perfect but exceptional for making or receiving calls. Add the auxiliary plug in and USB connection. I mean what do ya want for cry eye. AM FM with a slew of presets. Needless to say I am very happy with this purchase. Installation is what it is no matter what you buy but this is a winner. I solder all my connections and then run a ground wire besides to be sure to eliminate any popping or static.CDs and cassettes are a kind of thing of the past  so that didn't make that choice a big question.
5,For the price can’t beat it.
2,Please do your self a favor don't buy a cheap radio. Bluetooth unpaired all the time for no reason audio quality not great. No subwoofer output. Well if you looking for something to get you going go for it other thant that I was not happy with this radio at all.
1,I've got this installed like 2 weeks ago and I've used it like.... 3-4 times tops? Today it stopped working. Like it would behave all crazy selecting different options not being able to stay in anything none of the buttons responds except for the volume rocker.Please do not buy this! It's such a waste of money. Leason learned. Will be getting a pioneer or so.
4,Excellent value hooked up great works perfect.
5,This is my second purchase of this unit for a vehicle and I couldn't be happier! Both my Jeep CJ7 & Land Rover Discovery 2 were plug and play installs and the unit performs great despite its very low price point. Bluetooth connectivity is never an issue and the unit recognizes my ipod with needing to reconnect each time! The equalizer settings are spot on and I'd recommend this unit to anyone in the market.
5,I put this in a 76 VW beetle. Fit good sound quality is pretty decent for the price and the blue tooth connectivity is as good as my 2021 Truck. Highly recommend for the money.
5,This thing word sweet. Great bang for buck
5,Great radio for the price easy to install seems sturdy and sounds pretty good with fm am and bt. The bt the controllers are simple and easy to use and the bt connects fast and easy only down side is the screen is very dim during the day
5,For the price I’m very pleased with this I read some reviews before hand and some good and some were bad but I’m glad I bought it easy to hook up and fit perfectly in my 2002 Dodge Ram and I’ve had absolutely no problems with the Bluetooth connection and even the mic works pretty good only wish it was closer to the driver side but it works so I’m happy with it.
5,Happy with the radio.
4,Ligero pero efectivo.. funciona muy bien!
5,We a good buy
3,It's still working after about 6 months so that's the good. I would like the power button to be instant like on my old radio. That way when an annoying commercial comes on I can silence it easier. This one you have to hold in for a few seconds. The unit is definitely under powered for anything more than two speakers. The blue tooth is finicky. If you move your phone out of range and come back it will not reconnect. You have to shut the power off for a time before it will reset. I disconnected the battery to service the vehicle and the head unit died once. It didn't blow any fuses but it would not turn on other than part of the backlight. I disconnected the harness took it apart put it back together and now it works. Couldn't find anything wrong. I would have spent more for a higher quality unit.
4,It does exactly what you expect a cheap receiver to do. I've owned it for about 5 months and the only thing I don't like is the stupid phony sound visualizer. It will just bounce around to no music in the same preset motion over and over as you contemplate why the mad creators of this product thought it wise to include it. As you lay awake at night your mind will no longer be soothed by the once calming sounds of your favorite artist. The bouncing visual will encompass all you see. It will be everywhere.But if you can get past that then you'll appreciate this product!
5,For the price I had no dislikes. Easy to install and work great with Bluetooth the only reason I got it. I have been told there's some echo sometimes when talking on the phone but that could be a number of things? I don't get that as much using my other cars Bluetooth?
1,I ordered this with very minor expectations. I wanted to be able to plug in my XM Receiver via Aux Cord and be able to talk hands free. I wasn't expecting the world. With that being said it is being returned. Here is my list of issues.The hands-free option technically works but everyone complained at how they could barely hear me and how much echo they had. I was damn near yelling and people still couldn't hear me. This started on day 2. Day 1 it was crystal clear.The blue tooth intermittently wouldn't connect to my phone. I had to completely forget the device on my phone and try again. This may have been my issue by trying to rename the device on my phone but that hasn't caused a problem before on other devices.The AUX cord port is very loose and sloppy. There is no real positive click when plugging in. It just sort of sits there. I kept touching it to make sure it was backing out going over bumpy roads.The unit randomly turns itself on for a split second when not in use. I've noticed multiple times. The car will be parked and off. I'll walk by and see the display light up and say "Good bye" then it turns back off. Not good for your battery.The Equalizer effect is beyond obnoxious. I have the unit dimmed as much as possible and the flashing bouncy lights in the corner of your eye is so incredibly distracting while driving. Especially at night.Bottom line spend a few bucks more and get a better unit. It'll pay for itself in the long run.
5,You have to hit a button to get to the Bluetooth every time you get in the car but it works really well
4,My only issue is that i have to press a button to display the clock. The clock doesn't stay visible. Everything else is fine tho.
4,Has been great so far! I have a couple months with it i i almost have no complains in this  quality or funtions. And its a very cheap product.The few complains i have are that sometime when i turn it on i start playing the last song my phone was playing if the radio and the phone are still on BT. The radio grahp of the music isnt static but it isnt funtional at all it doesnt change with song rymht or frecuencies. Its just do the s ame thing  over and over.... thats lame. But those are some minor complains it works great.
4,great for the price but you have to have the Bluetooth on your phone on before you turn on the car for some reason
4,Love it
5,It works goid
1,it took me a while before I had a chance to install it and when I did it wouldn't do anything the screen turned on but every button just turns it off and on again.
5,fits right in my car. thank you
4,Easy to install if you have done it before and know what you are doing if not the wire are named different then stock radio and color coding is different
4,I had to buy and exchange it but the second one I got worked perfectly and had everything I needed for itSo I ordered this radio thinking it has usb play (it didnt but luckily it had Bluetooth Which is even betterThe first unit I bought had a faulty Bluetooth but everything else was working greatThe second unit I swapped it out for worked perfectly including the BluetoothAmaing radio for the price. Has all the bells and whistles of a new car and it’s less than $50
5,For the price it's an excellent product. I used it on my 2001 CLK Benz and works like magic. (If you own a W208 Benz (1998-2002) you'll need an antenna adapter and another cable (forgot what they're called)  so that it works in your car but those are cheap too.)Sound quality is great.To turn it off you either need to looong press the volume button OR use the remote that comes with it. That's the only thing I don't like about the stereo.Also if the Bluetooth stops working remove the stereo unplug everything on the back wait a few seconds and plug it back in. It will reset the system but Bluetooth will be back! (and no the reset button doesn't work foe that)In short for the price it's a great deal.
2,I installed in my 1st gen Tacoma and it rocks! Has good EQ for MP3's ..so far it's been great update the unit keeps going to "pause" and it's difficult and frustrating to get regulars function WTF BOSS? will probably replace as I need NAV BT and music to work when I'm working in the field. I can't continue to loose calls because it PAUSED whenever it wants BT is mediocre at best. disappointed
4,I don't have many complaints with this unit. It works and looks great.Pros:- Very good looking. Bright blue LEDs- Bluetooth works great- Versatile options for input source (1/8" auxilary BlueTooth SD USB Radio)- Instructions are clear- Has a clockCons:- This unit is HOT I mean it gets really hot. Like 120+ degrees hot. Not sure if that is normal.- Clock only displays when you press a button or the unit is off- Would like to see RGB options instead of Blue only
4,If you want a simple bluetooth receiver  this is it. I get in start my truck and it connects and starts playing whatever I was listening to last. It's great for podcasts when I'm in and out of the truck all day. Lost a star due to the fact that there is an image of a VW beetle prominently displayed in the center of the screen for some reason... what's up with that? You can see it in the item images but I thought I'd at least be able to change it or something.
5,The shipper was great fast shipping quality is good perfect for the whip great fast service
5,My radio was old CD now just use youtube connect Bluetooth and play new music
4,there are definitely better stereos on the market but this is a bargain for this price range. good purchase
5,Nice
5,I’ve had this for n my Jeep now for a few weeks. It’s worked perfectly every time. I listen and use YouTube mostly and the Bluetooth works great ! I’d have to say that this lil unit is the nicest (cheap priced) stereo I’ve had to date. Now I need some better speakers. I bought the plug that wires up to my stock plug  so I didn’t have to butcher up my harness. I’m actually impressed with this lil radio! Probably gonna but another. Oh and the hands free call feature actually works as well. My Jeep is pretty noisy so the mic has a hard time working well  but that’s not the radio’s fault.
5,if you have ever installed a head unit its like that but again.The unit has worked perfectly since installation.As soon as there is power to the unit it connects to my phone on a few seconds and starts playing my music. Thats all I wanted and it delivers.Otherwise there are no notable features but the price can't be beat.Outstanding value for money if you have simple needs
1,I bought this unit for my weekend Tahoe. I’ve been stalled car audio professionally for seven years I know exactly what needs to be done.. upon installing this head unit yesterday and worked phenomenally up until I got in my truck to go to lunch today. Has power all the teachers function on it it has no sound coming from my car speaker. Retore my dash apart recheck all of my connectors made sure all my wires were properly connected. Still no sound. Was trying to save a couple bucks because the truck is just a daily driver for the winter.. I guess I lived and learned you get what you pay for! DO NOT purchase this head unit spend the extra $10 and buy the Jensen! Never had a problem with boss audio before this is pretty disappointing.
5,We installed this radio into a 1993 Miata MX-5. It is a beautiful modern addition. Now we have a Bluetooth connection directly to our iPhones Super sound amazing features and totally modernized the old girl’s sound system.The value for the features is incredible.
5,Performs as advertised. Had it for a few weeks now no issues what so ever.
5,Okay. No menue to adjust audio settings like bass.
4,Pretty good product for the price. I have had it for over a year now and haven’t had any issues with it!
4,For the price this Boss works great! It actually pushes out wattage quite well distorting on the far upper-end of course. (No I did not take time to load the unit or test specifics.)  Two grips (which at this price I can live with...) 1: The Bluetooth signal needs more gain before the amplifier-stage.  One has to crank the VOL louder than what would be the listening-level when on radio-mode.  And yes my playback audio files are optimized to 0db.  2:  The faux "spectrum-analyzer" is annoying...  Over all the unit is great for a cheap replacement.
5,It really classes up my late model Camry.  The wiring diagram was easy to follow.  I installed it in under an hour.  For around $32 I got a great radio that picks up more stations than the old one and has bluetooth connectivity as well.  It doesn't have a cd player but I didn't want one and that's why I chose this particular model.  I haven't tried to play music from a thumb drive yet but I will.  I can potentially have my entire music collection on cue in my car.  I think I got a great little piece of technology for a bargain.
1,OK this thing didn’t even last a month I ordered this thing and got it on April 12. It’s now Mother’s Day. This thing is garbage I’m driving down the road and all of a sudden I can’t turn the music down when you turn it down the volume goes up when you turn it up the volume goes up you can’t turn it down. The sound quality is bad ! You get what you pay for this is a $30 stereo and you get $30 worth of enjoyment not even a month this thing is garbage. Save your money up get yourself $100 pioneer Kenwood. Get something good. Boss audio sucks
1,This thing is a giant hunk of steamy dog poop.  Don’t wast your money it would honestly take an hour to describe everything that is wrong with this unit
5,Great product. Love it so much. Doesn't look like a cheap radio. Looks high end for a single din. I absolutely love it. Thank you Boss.
4,I am happy with the functionality and quality.  Never has disconnected or dropped the Bluetooth audio connection like many other inexpensive Bluetooth speakers I have used.  The VU meter/spectrum analyzer thing is just a light show and I do not care for it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 For the amount of money this costs paired with a set of Infinity Primus 650w speakers in the rear I have no complaints. For a cheap quick and decent replacement head unit I highly recommend this!
5,I have a 98 ranger and only use it for errands. This radio is perfect for those vehicles that are not daily drivers and not used often. Does it have the best sound quality? No but for the cost I don’t think you will find anything close to this value. It does sound better than the factory radio and Bluetooth works perfectly.
3,Works good and sounds good but has no way of having the time as a chosen display. You have to push a button and then the time goes away after 30 seconds or so. If I knew this before hand I wouldn't have even considered this unit
5,Well let's start with the good.  It's $30!  Yes I remember paying 10 times that for less.  It does everything I need and more  I replaced my radio in my 2001 Corolla gas saver.  I'm more than happy with it so far!Radio clear.  Blue tooth works great!  CD player?  Who uses those anymore anyway!Bad:  changing the time is annoying.  The unit it feels fake.  It's so light it feels like a kids toy it's comical.  But hey its $30 and works great!Overall:  I'm about to buy another one for my truck!
3,Hooked this up to my 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee in less than 30 minutes. Make sure to buy a harness adapter for your vehicle and connect the wires accordingly. This head unit comes with a chart to help with crimping the wires to the correct wires on the adapter harness. I'm still running the factory amplifier that came with my vehicle and the Pioneer speakers I brought are playing audio. The head unit doesnt display the time when it's running which is annoying. But you get what you paid for. I mainly brought this so I could use the auxiliary cord to play my music.
5,I did not want to install a expensive radio in my convertable due for breaking and entering basically being stolen this boss head unit was perfect with the wiring harness plug in none of the stock wires were not butchered in anyway this boss head unit was super eazy to install and sounds great at a good price i have a boss amp that i may hook up soon also purchased from amazon i have red some reviews about the displays malfunctions i turned the display on the lowest dim setting so hopefully i wont have any issues with it.
4,I really just purchased this because the radio in my car didn’t have a aux port. So I was pleasantly surprised by how well this Boss product works for me. The Bluetooth connectivity is great. I haven’t had issues with it yet. The  only issue I can think of is the sound quality of phone calls through my truck speakers.Out of the box it feels like a cheap product. But once it is installed it looks pretty good.
5,Having no problems so far
5,Many things to like about this. First off it's very simple yet sophisticated. Easily paired my iPhone to it and now every time I turn on the truck it syncs IMMEDIATELY to my phone. Gives me the capability to listen to Pandora and YouTube Red while charging my phone via USB. When calls come in I have the option to take them on the stereo via phone prompt which is nice. Pushed all my speakers loud with no issues when I installed it. Nice clean looking unit really like the blue backlighting. Price was very reasonable as well cheaper than many that I looked at and seems to be holding up well.
2,Good car stereo for the price. Bluetooth connects to phone almost instantly! All buttons and knob work. Sound quality is good.Here's what took this review from a 5 to a 2 -  the DISPLAY!Daytime: Turn it to it's brightest setting and you still can BARELY see it! I have to shade the screen with my hand and peek in to read what station is playing or what the volume level is.Nighttime: Turn it to it's lowest setting and it's still WAY TOO BRIGHT for night time driving! After attempting to ignore the blinding blue distraction it's display produced I've been forced to cover with a small cloth and tape at night.Unfortunately the display was the deal killer. And had to return the product.
4,It is more or less good I looked at it it could be better but it is fine.  I used it for my Van Winstar Thank you
5,I had to replace the dash pad on my old truck and needed to remove the radio so I thought I would upgrade from the old AM radio. This was around 30 bucks so what did I have to lose? Good thing I got it because I trashed the old radio getting it out. . I did get the wiring harness that fit my truck so that made installation much easier. The new stereo works great! radio reception is good. It paired with my iPhone easily and as soon as I start the truck I have tunes. My USB music stick works good too. So far no complaints.
4,Sounds good can't complain for a cheap radio.
5,This is a great little head unit for $30.  I wanted a cheap little Bluetooth radio that just works and this was exactly what I got.  Have an old Jeep and it sounds way better than the OEM radio and provides more power to my aftermarket speakers.  Bluetooth syncs to my phone every time I get in the car.  The only thing I wish it did was show track names on the LCD but hey it was $30.  I can look at my phone.
5,Easy to install. Great for my 86 Ford.
4,good sound easy hookup. Better than I expected.
5,Very good radio. It is powerful and the Bluetooth feature is fantastic. The remote control is handy.
4,Great unit! For the price ! Pluged in worked fine no problems .Made is USA !!!!!!!!!!
4,I'll keep it briefPros:-Sounds alright-Great Bluetooth integration-cheap AFCons:-The time wont display by default you have to press a button to see the time.  This is super annoying-The blue glow is too damn bright even at the lowest setting.Summary:If  you want something that will give you Bluetooth / aux in your older vehicle and don't want to spend too much money I recommend this product
5,Excellent product
1,This radio worked well for two months then it started doing what it wanted to do when it wanted to do it I tried resetting it several times it would work for a day or two and then it would start all over again switching between stations making phone calls on its own terrible radio and I’m unable to return it it would be great if somebody would get in touch with me
4,I like the sound of the stereo
3,No continuous clock option. The screen will say “BT connection” all the time and you have to push and hold a button to get the clock to display for a few seconds. The reason I took my factory radio out was due to the clock burning out. The other features are fine but frustrated about the clock.
5,I’ve always purchased name brand products in the past however I just purchased a 03 Jeep Liberty and wanted something inexpensive to upgrade to Bluetooth. I knew buying it and showing my husband that an offbrand can be just as good worked out well in my favor. Sound quality is GREAT so great I now know the Jeep needs new speakers and the BT connects IMMEDIATELY as soon as I turn on the car. So far I’m beyond impressed. And the price well if something does happen... I can just get another! Can’t knock it till you try it right?
1,Don't but it.Waste of money.the volume goes from 1-40 and with my phone at ANY volume level low or high after 30-32 on the volume knob the audio clips/distorts.This is NOT a volume/SPL issue. Its an issue within the head-unit itself....Very tempted to rip it out of the car and return it because its absolutely not worth the money! Every time I want to listen to music I'm hit with unbearable clipping issues as soon as I touch the knob!!!
5,Great product especially for the price. Blue tooth works great. Phone calls are clear and you can be heard clear too. Good power. AM & FM with plenty of presets. Screen could be a little brighter even on the high setting.
4,This is not a touch screen. The Bluetooth connects but sometimes when you turn on the car the music would be playing on your phone instead of your speakers. but it sounds legit. Great for the price!
4,Great little stereo for the golf cart.
5,Bought this to replace a 90s Audiovox rampage cassette deck in an old 93 E-150. This old work van has no muffler and sounds like a tank coming down the road. This being the case the inside noise is high! Tried the Bluetooth hands free calling and the phonecall was clear even for the person on the other end despite all the noise from the lack of muffler. Bluetooth connection was easy to set up and streaming works like a charm.
5,Frist you get what you pay for with that said I love it. My old system went out and wanted something along the same line ( old o e was boss also ). The sound is awesome the Bluetooth works great never a problem paring the back light is snap to adjust for different light. I listen to country rock and rap all sound great. I also have all boss speaker's. On a budget you can't wrong with this unit
1,Wasted time installing this junk.After about 8 minutes ONLY Bluetooth would work and unit would not respond to ANY buttons or remote. Disconnected power in dash to reset and Bluetooth and  would work but buttons and remote were inoperable to change stations equalizer etc.Cut the wires and sending it back.
5,This is a very good radio for the price point. I purchased this to put in my work truck. I wasn't looking for anything special. It serves the purpose of what I was looking for. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a radio that is not indidated with a over kill of special features.
5,This is a very basic radio that isn't very large in size at all. It fits a single din but the depth of the unit is unsually short however with that being said and after judging the book by it's cover I wired the unit up and to my surprise it works great! I love that it had the aux jack because let's be honest if it doesn't have that or Bluetooth (it has Bluetooth) then it's useless today because most of us plug our phone is and jam out. This let's you do that! Will buy again unbeatable price.
5,Bueno apatato
4,Fit nicely sounds great. Love i can charge my phone  with it as well.
4,Good little Bluetooth radio but wish it had CD player as well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Well first day in. Easy to install. Don’t lose the remote. Seems like the only ways to change EQ oR LOAD TO BE ON/Off. Sounds great for the price. 2001 Honda Accord with Kenwood 🔊
5,Five stars not because it's an incredibly good car stereo but because it has passed my expectations for the money. Installation was on par with every other car stereo I've installed and a quick read of the instructions gave me enough to get acquainted with the features and set the correct time. And it sounds good with the stock speakers on a 1996 Ford Ranger. For the money I can't imagine there's a much better way to add Bluetooth (music playback music control & calling) to your old car!
2,While it does not look very premium it sounds better than the much more expensive one it replaced. I have a jeep Wrangler and left top down overnight during a major storm and it killed my Jensen VX7012. I replaced it with this because I am selling jeep soon anyway but I am blown away at how great it sounds. I have it paired with a 600 watt amp with two 12 inch kickers and some front and rear 6 inch speakers. Sound is far better than before. I almost hate to sell it now that the sound is so good.Update (after a few months)I am looking right now for something better. It is just so cheap that i cant take it. This is a super cheap item. It may be ok for limited situations but it is not good for me. Im selling my jeep and i cant sell it with this thing in it. It works fine and i have had no problems but it is kind of a piece of junk. Good in a pinch but i would suggest spending a few more bucks.
3,The instructions were good and the install went really well even though I was nervous since I haven't done this in 20 years. I like the features and it sounds good. I installed this to replace the stock radio that was so old it still had a cassette deck!Unfortunately like other reviewers said the display just went crazy. Literally the day after I installed it the display stopped working correctly and sometimes shows half the screen and other times it's blank other times it's just dancing all over the place! The downside of it is that I can't really see what station I'm listening to or what function the system is on.The radio works so it's still better than the old one
2,You basically get what you pay for. It had lots of issues with the bluetooth connection where it would work fine for an hour then start stumbling and stuttering. It would not recover until it cooled off. It will distort at louder volumes (which is not that loud). Mine would occasionally not turn on and the display would have the backlight on but not respond to the buttons. I would have to pull the fuse it was connected to to get it to work. Now after two years it has completely died. Save your money and buy one that will last
5,I am impressed with the sound quality built in amplifier and easy to navigate buttons. I've always been impressed with the products BOSS markets although they have always been well above my price tolerance. There is no compromising in quality for this single din dash stereo.
5,I love the product and it  sounds great thanks
3,Instructions are average Sound is terrible. Easy to install. Lots of stations you can save.
5,For the price you can't beat this unit. I installed it myself in my truck and what surprised me is i can turn the volume up to the maximum literally  and no distortion whatsoever. Again great unit for the price
4,Good item for the price
3,As the title says you get what you pay for. I guess you can't ask for much for $30. Bluetooth is loud and Crystal clear. Call quality could be better. Overall it feels like super cheap plastic. My biggest gripe is the LCD display. I find on the low illumination setting is still a bit too bright and the bars moving up and down to the music are obnoxious and annoying. I wanted a cheap Bluetooth head unit and I got one to replace my broken factory radio. Since my goal was to keep it cheap I am sticking with this head unit but if I had to do it again I'd spend $70 on a much higher quality one with more options that are user friendly.
3,Great sound quality but not strong at all verry low volume for my speakers. I dont get any sound till 23 tops out at 43.
5,I purchased this Bluetooth Stereo because it was cheap in order to learn how to replace car stereos without much hope for sound quality ease of use or aesthetic display. This product had all three. As soon as I installed it in the dash of my (double din) Lincoln Town Car with the appropriate trim package and wiring harness it lit up and immediately made itself available for Bluetooth connection. The sound quality and volume are both comparable if not better than the "luxury" factory stereo and I have had no issues so far. I highly recommend this product.
5,Not a great stereo but a good one but an EXCELLENT value for its price. Put this in my Hyundai Santa Fe when the OEM radio failed. Went in fairly easily - Needed a harness and a bezel to go with this but the net cost for all three was under $50 which is excellent. Bluetooth has worked more or less flawlessly. Audio quality from my cellphone is good not stellar. Can be loud but will not blow out your eardrums. Controls are fairly intuitive.
4,Muy bueno
1,mine quit just after a year.  It was in my truck that I hardly drive.  While it was working it was worth the $30 I spent on it but 'you get what you pay for'.  Now it is cutting out.  When it quits the display is still lit but the large backlights around the knob are out.  It thinks it is playing but no sound is coming out.  I guess some part of the power supply is failing.  It makes a popping sound as it cuts in and out.1. Had a cheap sound like an AM radio.  However I was using cheap speakers as well ( $40 for 4 speakers)Car Speakers | BOSS Audio NX654 400 Watt 6.5 Inch Full Range 4 Way (Sold in Pairs)Boss audio Chaos Exxtreme 4" x 6" 2-Way 200W Full Range Speaker2.  the usb would play music on the thumb driver but the first couple seconds of each song were cut off.3.  the clock would only show for a second after you HELD DOWN a button for 3 seconds.4.  the spectrum analyzer really isnt one.  The overall brightness was so much I just  put black tape over that part of the display.5.  IT QUIT WORKING AFTER 1 YEAR.the good before it quit working1.  have you seen the price2. remote control3. usb and bluetooth
4,Decent radio for the money but it is buggy especially with the Bluetooth connections. Sometimes it just resets the radio back to factory settings and I have to change the audio settings back to where I want them. It seems to coincide with the connection or disconnection of the Bluetooth. Anyways it's s minor inconvenience in my life and I'm mostly happy with it.
5,Installed this in my 94 suburban and everything went smoothly it sounds great and has full adjustability apart from frequencies as it's not a high end player. But it does a great job and links right up with my phone.
4,Dim display even on highfuse pictured is a 15 ampactual is a 10 amp.
2,Having problems with the audio sound it goes up and down don’t know  what’s causing the problem or the radio has an effect
4,Sometimes The Bluetooth disconnects and you have to turn your car off and back on. Just turning off the radio it’s self doesn’t fix it. Not a big issue but sorta annoying
1,I wanted something pretty basic that had BT capability and no longer wanting to carry cd’s around. After less than a day or so the buttons became unresponsive. I took my son to the airport last night in the middle of the nba finals and couldn’t even listen to it due to this utter piece of crap. Save your $ and buy something with some better reviews. All I want is a credit don’t even want a replacement. I gambled and lost.
2,The bottom half of the display didn’t work all so it was completely illegible and the unit was unusable.  Boss tech support told me that the 612UAB’s display is known to be difficult to read in direct sunlight and that i should consider buying a different model that has a colored display.  I sent this one back
4,It was a 40 minute install. Color coded wires for ease of connection (Chevrolet) pretty satisfied. The Bluetooth hooks up nice one time setup. The display is still working after 2 weeks. For the money it’s worth it. It doesn’t have pioneer quality sound but it’s still good enough for the price. Overall I’m happy with the product.
5,Absolutely fantastic low end stereo.  Bluetooth tooth auto connect is flawless every time I get in the truck it never misses a beat. Pair with some decent quality speakers and the correct wiring harness sound quality is great.
1,Bought this for my work truck as I didn't wanna spend alot of money on a company vehicle but wanted to have radio with bluetooth for hands free calling. The wiring was straight forward like every other one I've installed. started the truck and it worked great...for about a week. Now the display rarely ever works as it should. Sometimes it doesn't display anything just blank but the other lights on the left still light up. Which means its impossible to know what radio station you are on or what function you are using/currently on (am fm bt).  Most of the time it will display pieces of the image/words but they're completely scattered and impossible to make out. Which again means it is impossible to know what you have selected... Maybe one out of 20 times I start the truck and the display is correct and I can actually see what I am doing rather then just guessing what station I'm listening to. I've wondered if it was getting hot but that is not the case as its cool to the touch and if I turn it off and on enough times it works correctly or it will be working correctly til I stop at a gas station/job site and start it back up only to find I'm screwed again.
4,Seems to be a good unit. It is very dim and hard to see in the daylight even on the brightest setting but otherwise a nice little unit.
5,Great price point.Only complaint was it had a wining sound that increases with the motor RPM
3,Not bad not the best but it connects to my phone easily enough and plays music... Sound is good. Bluetooth for phone no one can hear me so that's kind of a bust but otherwise not bad for the price
1,The unit worked great Bluetooth hooked immediately but stop working in less than. A month. So that's why I can't give it more stars
5,Got this little guy to do a quick replace in an old truck. Easy to hook up and works perfectly. Well worth its price and more.
5,Decent radio for the price. Will mention that it draws a lot of power so you might want to run a new separate power line to avoid it going into powere-safe mode. Other than that it works great!
4,Love it mostly.  if you are dumb enough to waste money on $100 shoes or Jeans then this is not for you. But if you want something reasonable then this is just fine. Only issue so far is  without reading instructions its not obvious how to change to a specific folder on the flash drive.
3,Good little head unit if you need Bluetooth. Two things that are really annoying. No way to display the clock if you are using the stereo. You can push the display button to see the time for a brief moment but then it goes back to whatever input you were using. The other annoyance is the Bluetooth input display. Instead of the logical Bluetooth or AT LEAST BT is shows A2DP. Who cares what profile is being used? Just put BT as the input display A2DP is completely stupid.
4,Decent device for something temporary while you save up for a stereo with quality.
4,Overall a nice unit especially for the price. Would be nice if clock display could stay on while music is playing. Just a personal preference but I'd rather be able to see the time instead of it telling me my phone is connected.
1,Junk guess would be good if you bought and sold cars just to have a am/fm radio other then that paper weight .
5,It's been about three weeks I have had it. Deserves five star undoubtedly. Bluetooth is easy to connect and works like pro. Sound is really great without noise. One problem is that the radio has "backway noise"of the engine which can be eliminated with an additional part.What I did was just disconnected the radio antenna and listen to the radio from my phone or something if I wanted to. Even with this issue I give it 5 stars because the build design and the quality is superb for less than 30 bucks.
4,Haven't had any trouble out of mine so far. Very pleased with it. Would recommend if your trying to save some money
5,Very simple product but it does what it claims to do. It connects with my iPhone to play music and works well with hands free calling. The sound is the same as the stock stereo.
5,Bought to replace the one in our boat. Wires were different color from old system but was able to discern what went to what. Works great!
2,I gave it one star because it works and only because it works. The sound quality is terrible even with new high quality speakers. No matter how much you "equalize" it with the bass and treble. The music sounds like you're hearing it through a sea shell I don't even want to imagine what it would sound like if I were to put an amp on it.The Bluetooth works quite well though so it has that going for it. But that's really all it has. You really do get what you pay for on this one don't buy if you care about sound quality.
1,This is the crappiest radio I've ever bought we'll see what the exchange policy and warranty is all about now fixing to do that I'll let you know on my next review
5,A great way to inexpensively add bluetooth capabilities to an older model Honda Accord with the right install kit (purchased from Amazon).
4,Like the reputation. Product arrived quickly and in one piece.
3,First one I got would not power on. Fast exchange through Amazon and the new one works fine. It’s not great but not bad you get what you pay for.
5,I used this to put Bluetooth in my 2003 honda and it worked great. I don't use AM/FM but that will mostly depend on your antenna and not the stereo. Like I said my main use case is to connect to my phone and now my phone is my infotainment. Works great!
2,I bought this for a cheap Bluetooth head unit as I had purchased a BOSS for my last car and it worked great. This model looked about the same and after install it worked great. After about 2 weeks the Bluetooth became extremely quiet and robotic I assume the Bluetooth chip or drivers are bad. I tried connecting multiple devices and restarting the head unit but the problem stays. My friend had the same unit and had the same problems so it seems like this model may have Bluetooth issues. There is a warrantee but the cost of shipping is the same as buying a new one. The radio still works fine so I will keep it installed.
4,For the money it is definitely worth it only thing I don’t like is that it doesn’t have a clock. Other than that I have had no problems with it
1,I bought this radio based on the low price point (at a "discounted" price) and good reviews. However it is an extremely basic radio. I couldn't even figure out how to change the display to show the time of day. It just shows the name of the song. The bluetooth connection was pretty reliable and the buttons all worked. As for the sound I'm not too experienced with judging that but the radio itself was really light weight leading me to think that it would be rather underpowered. If you're looking for a radio to put in some sort of vehicle or something that you don't mind damaging or wrecking then I'd say this is a cheap disposable radio for your usage.
5,This radio is a very good deal for the price.
5,I replaced used this to replace the stock head unit in my 2001 Toyota Corolla. Installation was very easy with the proper wiring adapter for my vehicle. The sound quality was an improvement over the stock head unit using the stock speakers. Aux works bluetooth works amazingly well for both streaming as well as answering calls. People I'm talking to can hear me well from the mic. Aesthetically speaking it looks good too. Hard to believe you can get a unit with all these features for $30.
3,Stereo worked fine until I was out of the garage. Display was so dim I could not see it. Three levels of dim and the highest setting should be what the lowest is. Boss tried to work with me by sending me another one but I declined because it would have the same issue. Stereo had to be returned.
5,If you are looking for a simple and easy to use car radio. This is it.  I have purchased 2 for 2 seperate vehicles and in both cars the installation was quick and easy.  The BT works very well and the sound quality is better than the stock radios.
4,Does the job easy to install. Works as expected.
3,This works alright. It wasn't difficult to install. But I've had to uninstall and reinstall it a couple times over last summer. It doesn't seem to like the heat and would show a blank screen and not work till it was disconnected then reconnected again. (disconnecting the battery alone didn't fix it)Bluetooth is solid. Having this is much better than having the non-bluetooth factory radio even though audio quality is a little more basic.The fake equalizer is bright and distracting. It would've been nice to have the option to turn it off.If you're broke and handy this'll do.
4,Easy install great value. Zero conectivity issues
5,Added to 2007 Corolla.  Still using original speakers so sound quality more at fault on my current vehicle.  Iphone connected through BT no issues.  All listed functions seem to work as described.  Call quality is not excellent but gets the job done allowing hands free answering.  Great value for the money.
5,For the price I paid for this item you cannot beat it. It was very easy to install. I was amazed at the sound quality and of course the bluetooth features. I can now drive and talk hands free when i need to.
4,I have owned this unit for about a year now and have had no problems with it. My only gripes are that the blue is rather intense at night and as of recently when set to bluetooth streaming the buttons don't work right.The select button increases the volume the next button goes says prev and number 6 skips.
5,Great product for cheap. Only complaint is that the illumination is very dim in the day even at max and Amazon delivered it the boss audio box and didn't cover it with a Amazon box so people could have seen it as they were walking by and know it was a car radio.
5,The radio for the price is great I gave it a five star before the value is one of the best values out there the only thing I find with it is the screen is not very bright even on the brighter setting so it’s a little hard to read for me but overall it was great for the value
4,was led to believe this would show the id3 tag information while in Bluetooth but no dice. also would prefer if it always displayed the clock but it only does while off. regardless huge improvement in sound quality vs the tape deck I had in there and now I don't have to use a cassette adapter
3,INSTALLATION: The instructions are trash. It lists like 3 steps out of 12. I superglued the aluminum piece the stereo slides in to the inside of the front console piece to make it work. It snaps in but would easily fall out and that's all that holds in your radio. You DON'T use the old 4 screw brackets attached to the old radio. There's no way to attach it without rigging weird crap. Everything else is fine but not that loud.
5,There aren't words for how great this is. I have an old Jeep that had a non-functional tape deck. I had written off the ability to get sound in it again. On a whim I tried this out. The install required some wire work (I am a newbie at this) but it worked on the first try and took about an hour. The unit has worked flawlessly over a bluetooth connection. I am astonished by the value for the price on this. I can't recommend this enough.
4,Pros:Super cheap and has a ton of options including built-in USBCons:Display is weirdly dim and can be hard to see in direct sunlightThe interface is not very intuitive and  takes some getting used to
1,Had it installed professionally and said it’s a bad radio… return window has now closed so it’s a paper weight.
1,So far not very satisfying.  I'm only getting 1 channel sound the left channel is not working. I don't know if it is the wiring or the radio yet because I need to take the entire installation apart to find out.
1,product is not as described low quality and volume stopped working not even a month after purchase would not recommend to anyone and will not be purchasing any Boss products for that matter!
5,I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this for my '06 Freightliner Columbia but I was pleasantly surprised.  The fit is a bit loose but easily remedied with a shim.  And it sounded great after I replace the stock front speakers with the BOSS Audio CH5530 Car Speakers also from the same seller ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J1C0TO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ).A month and a half later I encountered the display problem that others have mentioned.  Disconnecting and reconnecting the harness solved the pronlem.
4,I wasn't looking for a high end stereo system.  I just needed something cheap to use with my quad.  This system fit the bill perfectly.  Sounds good enough for the intended purpose and Bluetooth connects easily.
3,I like the hand free calling cause the volume works on the radio Bluetooth works well usb/charging port is great aux in put works great all devices that I connect have the same volume but my one big dislike is that the clock on my radio keeps reseting so it does not keep time witch is very disappointing to me because that is one thing I needed so I didn't have to look at my phone while driving.
3,You get a lot of features for the money we are really spoiled these days. The installation is pretty simple (2000 jeep cherokee) and everything works as it should.  It gets 3 stars for 3 reasons; the sound quality is terrible very tinny nothing close to the full sound i had from the basic stock chrysler stereo i removed.  There isn't an option to turn off the equalizer bouncing bars or image of the new vw beetle.  The controls aren't very intuitive.  Luckily i don't drive this vehicle often otherwise would be swapping it out for a higher quality unit.
4,Great for the price
3,I dont believe I've ever written a review for a product before so I HAD TO with this one. Solid radio easy to hook up easy to use but NO F!@#$%^&*ing CLOCK DISPLAY?! After hours of reading the user manual and tinkering with the radio I turned to the internet. I googled and read reviews apparently BOSS thought it was a good idea to not permanently display the clock "so it doesnt drain your battery". Absolute joke besides music playing WHY. ELSE. DOES. SOMEONE. USE. THE. RADIO?!? Instant 2 star drop.
1,I got this Radio on March 9th it made it til May 1st used the proper wiring harness connects and used heat tape seeing as it was a cheaper radio but even still it started dropping Bluetooth randomly sound quality started distorting like there was too much bass on stock 01’ Honda Civic speakers checked all my wiring and it was still good then yesterday on May 10th it just plays static through my BT this radio is 100% garbage do not buy it…
5,Installed into my Jetta 2003 someone did wiring prior to this radio exchange so it was really easy for me. I ran a cable from the ignition on the fuse box and hooked it to the Positive (red wire) and now my radio turns on when the car turns on and off when turned off. Sound is pretty good! Spotify is significantly less louder than normal music app but it’s only about 3 or 4 turns away from each other.
4,You're buying a cheap stereo so don't expect anything amazing but it gets the job done. Had to wire a special power line from a fuse tap but that may have been because of my wire harness. Does not get too loud and feel cheap volume button sucks but all in all it works well. Bluetooth does well.
2,Great value easy install (I had never done a car stereo install prior to this) connects up fine with my iphone and car antenna sounds fine connecting wires are a little bit high gauge - pretty thin but it worked.highly recommend also buying the right mounting kit a wiring harness with butt ends and an antenna adapter.the part where this thing disappoints on a scale that really makes me mad is the display.  Every car radio in the world has a default setting to show the time but for some reason this car favors a bouncing EQ animation which is completely meaningless and the source that is currently playing.  I do not understand this.I'm not mad enough to tear apart my dash again and return it but it's pretty close.A month later and it froze up on me requiring me to find a paper clip to hit the reset button. Luckily you can’t see the time anyways so resetting the clock isn’t a problem.I really dislike this thing.
5,Simple Radio. It works just fine for how cheap it is. Not the loudest not the best but overall solid. My one complaint (and it is a nitpicky one) is that the two light strips around the volume knob and main buttons are very bright usually more bright than the road ahead of you. This can be fixed with paint or tape if you choose to but is something I'd love to see addressed in the design in the future.
2,I want to start by saying that the sound from this thing is pretty impressive. I do have it coupled with a small amp but the four RCA channels out the back make for a really easy connection and great quality overall. That said my unit's screen doesn't turn off when the car is off. The radio itself turns off but the screen stays on frozen in its last position until the car is turned on again. I can't use any of the buttons when it's in that state it's just frozen. Then when I restart the car the time resets so the time is never right. Very weird. But then again the unit doesn't even display the time when it's on so that doesn't matter too much. I wish it did though. Overall I wouldn't recommend this. The display is already going on mine which seems to affect just about everyone on here and mine has further problems on top of that. I'm going to have to spend a little more money on something else I guess.
2,This stereo bearly makes sound. Every time you turn it off you have to re set your equalizer. Not worth buying.
2,I bought this 22 months ago and it's stopped working.  It worked okay except the display was so dim it was unreadable if the sun was shining and unsafe to read on cloudy days even on the highest brightness setting.It used to play acceptably but now the buttons don't work even the power button.  It can connect to bluetooth but the sound level fluctuates.I save one-star ratings for deplorable items and rate this radio two stars with reluctance.
4,Bluetooth cheap solid build easy controls and good looks this stereo unit has everything I need. This head-unit won't blow the doors off or impress anybody with audio capabilities but it does the job.
4,Very good product.  My only complaint is that when I insert some usb devices I get an error stating UPDATE on the display.  But other than that the radio and Bluetooth work perfectly.  And let’s be honest here:  it’s 29 bucks.  For that price it is quite excellent.
4,Would have gotten 5 stars for the price and bluetooth but I live in So Cal and the heat can be an issue. If the outside temperature is too hot this radio will start skip in and out on the sound. Luckily my AC can fix that but oddly enough I hate using the AC.
5,The best car radio I have ever seen.  The FM channels are unbelievable my $230 radio won't even catch FM stations where I live  but this one catches all even in my garage.  I love the USB for songs instead of using CD and the hands free phone it great.  I just bought another one for my other car.  Can't believe that a $23 car radio beats my $230 radio that I'm going to replace with this one.
4,You cant beat the price.  The only issues I have with it are the remote has to be really close to work and you CANNOT display the time.  You have to push a button to check the time and then it goes away.  This is really annoying.  But it's a good choice if you just want bluetooth.
4,I dont know， as this price is work. butas people know as this price， this one is not  good  enough. Is work but is just.... I don’t know I cant give 5 star  And for this 4 star is for this price
5,Very good
1,Installed this on my motorcycle. Will admit that it was a very easy install but then I also did have a radio installed and simply replacing the existing with this one. Bluetooth connected right away with no password to mess with. However sound quality want what I had hoped for not loud as I wanted. The skip or forward button only worked one time so not all functions worked as they should. Best part is that during only the third outting on the bike the sound completely stopped. Going try to do a reset and see what happens but not holding my breath. Went cheap got cheap results.... Going to cost a bit more but I'm going back to name brands.. at least I know I'll have music on my rides that way. Just too clear it up I only got about less than 6hrs total usage on this product.  Horrible
4,The hands free calling is good reactivity is smooth and I love that it connects instantly and starts playing my music touch free. Install was clear and simple takes just a few minutes and little material.
4,It would have 5 stars but aux port is not great might be mu old cord but rather than that it pushes my kenwood 6x9 extremely well very well priced
4,Love everything about it and price was outstanding BUT the only way you can see the time is if the radio is off it does not display the time when radio is on :(
2,I bought this to replace my old deck because of the cracked faceplate. I put this in and it sounded alright connected to bluetooth quicker then my old deck almost instantly. biggest problem i have with this deck is it sends my amp into protect mode at louder volumes. all my other stereo equipment didnt change i tried tuning and upgrading some wiring but to no avail. my only conclusion is when i turn the volume up its sending more power through the rca cables and messing with my gain. reinstalled old ugly deck and no problems even at full volume. guess this ones just gonna sit on the shelf and ill deal with the cracked faceplate on my old deck till it finally quits
4,Better than expected provided exactly what I was looking for radio MP3 option BT and connection to my SiriusXM thru the antenna.  Plus was that you can answer calls through the unit.  Sound was excellent for my taste and I only hooked it into rear 4 way 6x9 speakers.  Optional I can always a two front speakers as well.
5,Had it for a few weeks and so far so good all features work as expected volume is ok for my original speakers though sound needs some adjustment the mid tone is a little too high so I had to increase bass and treble to compensate.I would recommend this as a budget replacement
5,I liked
1,You pay for what you get. It keep freezing up. I keep hearing static every time I cut the radio on. I regret wasting the money
4,Ive had no really complaints. This head unit works bluetooth is fine. I do think people on the other end of a call have a difficult time hearing me but besides that it fine
4,cheap...works
5,Second purchase of this brand and it works perfectly. This one went into a 1999 Chevy Silverado and it got perfect and the sound is great. Would definitely recommend
5,It was super easy to install and the bluetooth connectivity is so easy to set up and it works flawlessly. Highly recommend this stereo if you need something cheap but great quality.
3,Had some issues hooking it up...but that was due to the old wiring in my 1994 f150. The screen is very dim even at the brightest setting. But it plays well and no real issues. Will update with any new issues. Also not a touch screen so idk why that is there.
2,Good sound but i don't received a remote control.
3,Cheap Radio but works and sound is good. Easy to install. The only problem I have had is after about 2 months in my Jeep it started not going to the USB move when I put in the stick so I now use a cable and after turning on the radio it goes to Radio even if the stick is plugged in so I unplug it and reinsert it and it then will work for awhile and sometimes have to do the each time I shut off the car and turn it back on.
5,wasnt expecting much out of this stereo for 40 bucks.it took minutes to install and sounded pretty good..all in all im very happy with this buy..bluetooth is awesome..
1,Didn’t work out of the box- couldn’t get it to power on. Garbage.
4,Cant see the screen even on Hi illumination. Works good but cant see the screen.
5,Bought this for my peter built work truck. Works as advertised. Plain and simple. Sound is decent. Easy to pair phone. Microphone isnt great but works
3,Installed the Boss ( not Bose) radio. This is not my first time doing this. Lights came on was getting a good signal according to the indicator bar on the display but no sound. swapped a few speakers to check is that was the problem. Got no output. I'm sure I must have gotten a 1 in a thousand that didn't work. I would advise anyone to bench test this unit before going thru all the trouble to install and have to pull it back out. Vendor refunded full purchase price so really can't complain.
2,Bought this stereo twice for 2 different cars. First one lasted a good 6 months before I sold the car with the stereo in it. Figured it was cheap and worked so might as well by another for to replace my non working factory stereo. That one lasted about a whole month before making a couple popping noises and then decided to not put out audio anymore. Display still worked fine no other issues but with the stereo itself.Got a refund but will not be buying again after reading more reviews it seems like quality control is poor.
5,Its good fit and what i dislike is that it should come with the radio kit for the customers car unless they dont want
2,Very Poor reception LCD keeps blacking out so you can't see anything on the ScreenI was delayed installing it so missed my 30 Day Return Window So we'll stuck with this Junk!!!!!!Come to Think of it 30Days is kind of lame for something that needs to be installed so you'd need a window of time to tackle it. Don't Buy This Unit go for something of Higher Quality.
4,This is a great budget head unit.  Dont think you will get the same quality sound as a top of the line Alpine unit.  You actually get more than what you pay for with this but not much.  It connects to bluetooth well and has acceptable sound quality for my old toyota.
3,Great value works perfectly wiring harness labeled and install was a sinch.Update.... So Ive had this head unit for long enough that I can't return it and although it was easy to install and use in am seeing why it was so inexpensive I am having issues with the unit overheating to the point that the Bluetooth starts stuttering and the LCD shuts off  all and all for the money I paid its working and its better than the stock radio I had prior. I am looking for a upgrade before this thing gives up the ghost.
4,Overall a very good low end receiver. Installing with wiring adapter is a breeze and had it playing music within an hour. Pairing Bluetooth device is also simple to accomplish. My only problem is it doesn't have a dimmer setting and as I work 3rd shift the light is very distracting driving to and from work. Overall a very nice product.
1,I really liked how easy an install this was I bought this for a friend and was planning on buying another for me. Problem is after 2 months the tuner quit working. Amazon is 1 month replacement warranty so I am having to deal with manufacturer now.
3,Everything is Ok except one thing. There is a big problem that the radio searching step is not one by one it searches by two steps. Therefore I can not switch the radio stations on the double-digit numbers for example on the FM 104.0 106.0 or 90.0. For that reason I can listen only single-digit stations - 100.5 103.3 105.5. It prives me of listening the half of radio stations available in my country.
1,Great while it lasted but that wasn't long. Made it 3 months and then the first heatwave of the summer it fried in the heat. I know it's a cheap radio but I was hoping it would last for a year at least.
4,So far so good! I bought two. One for my truck and one for my 72 beetle! I like it. It links to my phone quickly and will continue playing where I left off on spotify! For the price I figure I can't go wrong?
5,Thank you very much. I am very satisfied. He arrived three days earlier than promised. I have already installed it and it works beautifully. Thanks for the quick service. I will recommend everyone to buy from here. Fast service good quality many people can learn this. Thanks.
4,Nice for the price.  Works ok  easy hook up and set up.
5,The Bluetooth in this head unit works fantastic for talking on the phone or for playing back music.
5,Clear instructions and easy install. My Bluetooth connected right away and connects automatically every time I get in the car I don’t have to go through any buttons. Great sound and easy to use. Would buy again. NO CD PLAYER
5,This is the easiest radio to install setup and use. Plenty of sound power. Love the remote. Best car stereo for the money ever!
5,great radio for the price
4,For the price this was a very good unit to give my old truck hands-free Bluetooth capabilities. 11 year old speakers don’t sound that good with it but it is OK. Only real issue is the clock does not display when you are using It. Clock only displays with the power off.
2,Dislikes led brightness isn't very good at all. Glare is bad and way to dark. Can't see anything unless I cover it with my hand. Which takes my eyes off the road. (which I try not to do.) Sound quality isn't good at all. Very staticy and I got the best antenna on the market.  Likes--- Bluetooth connects well. And phone calls are decent.
5,I have a very small space to fit this thing and after years it still sounds good!  Bluetooth can take some time to connect every now and then.  Bluetooth stopped working randomly one day and after a few days I realized there is a reset button on the front.  Used it and it's working again still after a few weeks so I don't think it'll be a consistent issue.
5,Uh for $25 this thing was a steal! Super easy install and wiring effortless Bluetooth hookup easy to use remote. Had it wired and playing in my creeper van in less than 20 minutes. Playing though that single speaker like a champ. If you’re a cheap ass like me this Ol girl will treat you right.
5,Great little radio. I used it to put in the glove box of my 70s car and keep everything looking stock. Everything sounds good and connects to my phone via bluetooth every time I start the car. I pretty much only use it for bluetooth to play spotify and pandora from my phone. I love how this is smaller than a normal CD player deck making it easily fit in my glove box.
4,Great value for a single din. Put in my work truck and it is the perfect application.
4,Installed the radio in my Harley and works great for the money.
4,Great for the price bought it honestly to build a speaker tube for my atv was honestly only expecting it to last 1 or 2 rides but I have had it several months and use it about every weekend and still works great
5,The iso connection on the rear of this radio was prefect for my International 8600i (big truck) no cutting just plug and play.
5,The Bluetooth won’t stAy connected. Tried several devices. This is worthless without Bluetooth. The sound is almost mono sounding. Very cheap. Should have stuck with Walmart on this.
4,Great for how cheap but backlight is not very bright during day
3,Cheap and it shows randomly pauses music and isn't heavy duty. It does work but I will be upgrading.
3,For $29.00 its what I needed. BUT with that said -- its a cheap radio. The Bluetooth has issues connecting about 50% of the time. The sound is NOT rich - its very tinny ... The frequency range is definitely not what they state -- it sounds like a cheap radio ... Other than that its OK ... For a 29.00 radio I should give it 5 stars - BUT the thing weighs about 2 pounds - very cheap plastic ... and sounds accordingly ....
4,I like it okay but the display is very dark even at highest brightness. Can barely see to program it in daylight. Have not tried Bluetooth yet.
3,It lasted about 10 minutes & died. This is my 2nd boss radio.The 1rst one lasted a year.
4,got it for my chevy impala love this thing. tip: if it shuts off & wont turn back on but u see a dim light coming from it its not the radio its the fuse for the radio. i changed my blown fuse and it hasn’t been a problem ever since :-)
5,For the price this product exceeded my expectations I wanted a cheap Bluetooth head unit I could put in a project Jeep and keep it similar to the one look. Overall I am beyond satisfied.
4,Looks and works excellent! The only issue I have is that on occasion the Bluetooth won't hook up to phones. All I do is shut the radio off and turn it back on then it works. It's only happened two or three times in the half a year I've had it.
5,Lots of good sound out of small unit. Remote never worked but for the price in a car I really did not need a remote.
4,Sometimes when I turn on the car it doesn't connect to my phone and I have to turn it off and on again to work. But 95% of the times it connects right away and continues to play the music. Worth the price.
1,There were multiple issues from the beginning.  The lights on the display were so incredibly bright and couldn't be turned down that we covered the bottom of the display (the equalizer bars) with electric tape and used fingernail polish to paint the blue bars on the side of the knob in order to dim the display enough to drive with it on at night.  The arrangement of buttons was baffling with the buttons being tiny and bunched up on the far side of the screen in order to make room for the useless display.  There was no way to turn off the radio without turning it all the way down in volume which made it really awkward when someone called in you pulled through a drive through etc.The quality of the sound was meh at best.  But we soldiered on I mean you get what you pay for right?After 7 days the radio quit working.  The display still lights up so we know it's not a wiring issue but the brain is dead.  We discussed it at the time and decided it was such a crapola radio that it's not worth trying to get it replaced or repaired.  We'll be replacing it with something manufactured by someone else.
3,Car: Toyota Camry 1996Harness:   Metra 70-1761 Radio Wiring Harness For Toyota 87-Up Power 4 Speaker        Blue lights are too bright and after a couple months started to stay on even when the car was off. I had to open the thing and physically de-solder all the LED'sInstallation was simple. Bluetooth works fine. Aux in works fine. Wish they didn't have the ridiculous 'visualizer' that doesn't actually reflect the music that is playing.Sound quality is a little muffled in the mids although that could be due to my car speakers.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             It's not touched screen but ut has a remote. This radio fit perfectly in my car and I didn't need to buy any other part or accessories.I just got it installed so I'll update as I use it. Thr bluetooth works fine but I haven't received aby calls to check the handsfree.
5,put this stereo into my 96 taco and the sound was pleasantly nice easy install with 0 modification to the dash
5,Great!!!!!!! Don’t be fooled by the price I have a 1991 Mazda Miata and the stereo finally gave up and I don’t have a lot of money so I got this. It is super easy to program all the stuff you want like treble and bass and the Bluetooth works very well. And also I like how it looks I totally recommend this product. I also bought boss speakers with this and they sound as good as Sony speakers do.
3,It works. Sound doesn't get loud until 20s and the max is 43 so about half way. The remote was the funniest because it melted being in the sun for 1 day
4,The stereo is easy to use and  connects easily via Bluetooth. The only problem I had was with the built in microphonethe person on the other end could not hear me at times and my voice sound muffled.
4,The only reason I can't give it a 5 star review is cause occasionally I have to forget it on my bluetooth in order to reconnect it to my phone. Otherwise this is a wonderful purchase!
5,Great buy for the price! The only thing about it is the radio is a little wide... so I needed to cut out the installation kit to fit other wise great product. Also the hands free speaker sucks.
1,Came with an internal “disconnected” fuse. Never would power up or anything. You get what you pay for :/
1,I got my product in the mail Friday and installed everything on Saturday. Turns out that the unit already came with a blown 10 amp fuse from the factory. so I replaced that fuse with another 10 amp fuse. After that. I started blowing fuses on my car as well on another car I tried to test with. I looked on the product page as there was a 15 amp fuse in the image and was suspicious right away. I am not satisfied at all with the purchase.
5,For the price that I paid for this radio the sound is excellent the fact that it’s also Bluetooth incredible you can’t beat that.
4,Basically just bought this to be able to use my phone for music in an older vehicle. Install is simple and hard to beat for the price. Can't see the clock when using the radio and the radio isn't that great. But does what I need it to do.
5,ES DE EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y TIENE BUENA DEFINICIÓN PUEDO CONTESTAR MIS LLAMADAS CON EL SISTEMA BLUETOOH ME ENCANTA
5,Easy install and a unit for the price. I wanted a basic unit for my Jeep and this delivered.
4,Radio works great for the price. The only complaint is how bad the mic is when I’m trying to talk to text or use the phone as a speaker through the car
4,Is very good
5,I installed this in our pontoon boat and it works great. The wife enjoys the BT which works well listening to her songs and controlling the volume. The unit has enough power to listen while we are cruising the lake at full speed. THe unit isn’t waterproof so we take it out after every use. I would buy again great price and fast delivery.
4,For $30 it is what it is.  A bluetooth/aux port head unit.  Easy to install and does its job.  Feels cheap is cheap.  Works great in my 1997 Honda.
4,The sound and functions are pretty good for an entry level unit. However if don't want to have a VW bug icon in the middle of your display without a way to change it or disable it then buy something else.
5,Sounds great
5,Bluetooth connects quickly good sound
5,Couldn’t be happier with this radio. Only cost $30 and puts out plenty of power to speakers easy to hookup and setup and has BT with microphone. Very simple but can’t beat it for the price
4,Easy to install I only had front speakers so amps are half. the hands free phone is great except no on screen dialing out.The price is well worth having blue tooth....barely can read led if sun is out....
5,Great radio. I put it in my tractor. Takes a beating but still works like the first time using it
5,I liked how easy it was to install. Wanted a car radio without a CD player. I really don’ need the remote. Normally just listen to my favorite channel. But it came with it. The sound is great will be better when I up grade the speakers.  It only took a few days to get the order. Priced right. And is working perfectly.Thank you
4,I gave the product a 4 star due to how bright the led is on the “low” setting. Driving to work at 5 a.m. it is pretty bright.
2,Poor FM reception;
1,Was very pleased with unit until failure 3 days outside exchange window.
1,Bought the product had it sitting and waiting until I could get time to install it. Finally got to it and the unit was burned out before I even got it connected. Waste of time and money spend a little more and get a better quality. Return window closed so I cannot return it- will be throwing it out as I already have a paper weight
4,I purchased this stereo a few months back. It has worked like a champ with no issues. The only thing I wish it had was a way to turn off the on-screen display.
5,stereo did not come with wiring harness or the mounting sleeve! had to spend $40 extra $$ should’ve just spent a little more on a better head unit...
3,Very cheap product. Works but don't expect much.
4,Replaced a stock AM/FM 8 Track stereo in a 1979 International 1086 tractor. Works great via Bluetooth and has remarkable radio reception for a budget stereo. Worth the change.
5,This was my first aftermarket radio and it rocks. The only reason I upgraded was because it only has 1 set of RCAs. I wanted to put a 4 channel and a sub amp. To put both of those amps you need 3 sets of RCAs. Other than that and bluetooth this radio has everything you need. SD card slot works great. USB works great and so does aux and the radio.I ran a subwoofer off of this as well.
3,Get what you pay for. Screen on high illumination in day time is hard to see. Works ok on my golf cart for 30.00. Wouldn’t install  in a vehicle
1,After 3 weeks buttons quit working. Pressing any button might put station on 87.5 might change input might turn it off. It's basically unusable. Even if you get it to Bluetooth mode by luck with a random button adjusting volume might change mode or turn it off. Absolute junk
4,as described
4,The microphone could be a lot better... You have to almost scream at it . Plays Bluetooth really well. And easy connection to my galaxy...
1,I hire a technician to install this audio system  after he finished the radio does not respond  bluetooth is not able to connect with my phone . Its just waste of money and time doing all of this for nothing . As i can see by the reviews im not only one that have the same issue with this product .
5,I put this radio in a work van and it works great. Bluetooth connects quickly with ease and automatically when you get back in the car. The microphone works better than expected as well. I'm not a huge fan of the dancing equalizer lights and I haven't figured out how to make the clock stay on (if you can) but for the price you can't go wrong.
2,Needed a cheap replacement for my old car stereo so this was what I went with. Sound quality is not great; FM reception is decent AM not so much. LED display is hard to read in daylight. Speaking of the LED when the unit is on you have to push a button to display the time which inexplicably displays with a zero in front (so 9:15 a.m. displays as "AM 09:15". The controls on the front of the unit are minimal. Thirty bucks is probably too much to pay.
5,Very simple to install Bluetooth connects really fast  not much features and for some reason you hear the radio very low  when you're using the Bluetooth and you pause a song
3,Works great in my nissan sentra. Does not have a wire for amp remote wire in the harnessAfter using for a little longer I found a problem in the radio if u plug a vape into the USB charging port the radio will freeze and stay on even when the car is off and the key is out of the ignition. To fix this u have to unplug the radio harness and plug it back in
2,Sound quality is fine not amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is great...as long as you have Bluetooth turned on on your phone before you start the car. If you try to turn on Bluetooth on your phone once the car is on the stereo refuses to connect. This has led me to turn my car off and on again at stop signs just so I can use the stereo.
5,Is kind a small unit but is very powerful and handle very well two speakers 6x9 with no problem and Bluetooth connectivity very quick  highly recommend this product
3,Just installed this. Everything seems to be working well. The Bluetooth connection is good. The display is incredibly dim! Even in the highest setting it is hard to see in the day time.
3,Decent for the money.  Bluetooth disconnects frequently.
4,Pros: inexpensiveHas Aux USB and SD and BluetoothHas remoteEasy to installLoud feature makes serious bassCons:Feels cheap. Like it will break easilyCan't save timeButtons are loudThe sound bars on the screen are random and don't flow with the musicThe little black trim around it comes off easily
1,I bought this primarily  for listening to podcasts from a USB.  The firmware is buggy - on short tracks it truncates 10 seconds it doesn't handle tracks > 1h without looping or skipping.  There's no  fast-forward feature.  The bluetooth pairing to an iPhone is spotty - at least for me.  Since this puppy cost $150 to install in my 1999 Honda CR-V (both the console disassembley and the wiring were challenging so I hired a pro) the low price tag didn't offset the defects.  I wish I would have bought a better unit perhaps from CarToys cuz they'd  (hopefully) sell the right one for my use case.  Oh - the problem with Honda CR-Vs is that they last forever so I'll likely go to my grave with this "bargain"
3,I really wanted to like this thing. Easy to install clear instructions buttons in intuitive positions and it sounded good too. The display went crazy though and sometimes worked when I disconnected all power and plugged it back in.  Then it went nuts again. Other reviewers had similar problems. Maybe it was a bad batch but taking the console out of an MG is too tedious to keep fiddling with it.
3,It is a fine radio. We put it a farm truck and it is adequate for that. I would not put it in an everyday car. It is a good low cost radio the plugs were compatible but substantial modification was needed to secure it.
5,Easy to install and played music. Can't ask for more than that for the price.
5,It's perfect just what needed me for the comfort of my car and for the class it adds and also freshness. I admit I did a lot to install it but a friend came and did in less than thirty (30) minutes... Since it is the joy and happiness in my car especially with the sound quality which is perfect and the Bluetooth system that is at the top.
3,this is a basic radio. it will play off of a thumb drive; but in sequential order in the files. so put in order the songs you want to play in a separate folder for each cd then put it on the drive.that's the only way to separate.it functions OK. there is no bluetooth though...which seems almost standard anymore
5,Compre este producto para regalárselo a un amigo no se si lo instalo ya oh no  pero cuando lo revivió me comentó estaba muy bueno
5,Installed this radio in my 1977 MGB. It works well and the sound is good. No complaints.
4,Works great. Simple and powerfull. The bluetooth is very clear. I do wish it had a seperate sub control would have gave it 5 stars if it did. It does get kinda hot as well installing a fan in the back is a good idea.
4,I wish the cheesy faux-equalizer display could be disabled along with the goofy front view of a VW Beetle but other than it's a nice unit. Pairs nicely with my old S2 via Bluetooth has surprisingly good sound--better than my old $200-new Kenwood from 2001 that it replaced.
5,BOSS 616UAB fits well in my 2006 Hyundai Tiburon people say the interface is too bright at night but you can lower the brightness to Low and becomes perfectly fine. Had the ordinary Bass Treble L/R and F/R adjustments but no SW. Overall this radio is still lasting and good for the price while i ordered it back in january and works excellent.
5,Used this to replace an old head unit in my motorcycle fairing looks and sounds great easy to use and install is a breeze with basic wiring knowledge. I will say the mounting bracket is kind of flimsy but will mostly stay put if you bend all of the tabs out. Other than that this is a great stereo for the price
5,Just installed and all the pictures seem to work as described. Great price for all the features included.
4,Installed easily.  Bluetooth works great.  AM radio reception is not the best.
5,So far so good.  I needed an inexpensive radio to replace my factory unit to give me Bluetooth calling capabilities.  So far this has performed flawlessly.  I stream music via Bluetooth and the radio has the ability to skip to the next song by using its buttons which I really like.  Sound quality seems fair through Kenwood 6.5" speakers.  Overall I am very satisfied.
1,Stereo nunca funciono bien desde el primer dia. No lo recomiendo.
3,You can't have it show/stay on just time.
2,Sounds ok bluetooth works ok.The equalizer display on bottom of screen is no more than a looping distraction. Would be better utilized as a permanent clock display. The only way to see the time when radio is on is to hit a button on the remote that is not back lit.I will likely not purchase this brand again.
2,Writing this on the evening of April 30 2020. Item was purchased on May 27 2019. Didn't even last a year. Volume control began acting erratic and not working 6 months after purchase. Remote failed 2 days ago. unit refused to turn off and became quite warm. Pulled from vehicle an hour ago and will be heading to the dump as tomorrow is trash day.  Bluetooth connectivity was awesome and effortless though! Good sound when it chose to NOT reset equalizer settings and radio presets randomly.  Good luck but I won't be making this mistake twice.
4,Sometimes when I start my junk and the voltage is too low the radio locks up. Pull the fuse for a second and it works fine again. Other than that I'm pleasantly surprised at sound and function.
1,I was just like you.  I’ll try it for $36 but the honeymoon only lasted 2 weeks.  It locked up on a single station and that was all I needed as motivation to rip it right out and replace it with a proper brand name.  I was able to return within the window but you may not be so lucky.  It’s a roll of the dice.  Spend $150 and get a deck that will last.
4,Easy to install. Great sound. Haven't figured out all the features yet. It says I can call via bluetooth but so far it hasn't worked. Nice little radio for my truck.
3,If you want a high end stereo look elsewhere. But if you need decent sound with the ability to stream and make hands free calls via Bluetooth this could be just what you need.A more sensitive mic would be good but this unit is still usable in my old Dodge diesel truck.
1,Had to  return.Tried  several times... looked a wiring  and  diagram  several times. Was taking  voltage  but  nothing  workedI  was  looking forward to it  being used.
1,When I installed it it the left side of speakers worked only nothing on right. Next day no volume on left and right worked. Then no volume... Went to Walmart and got a cheep radio. And it's still working fine..
3,Overall not to bad biggest complaint it doesn’t not constantly display the clock and usually just says A2DP whatever that means probably refers to Bluetooth but a clock seems way more useful. Sometimes it needs reset because it acts up and is all glitchy then you have to reset all you presets and settings. But it’s cheap and if you have a watch guess it works.
5,Bought this for my 96 Miata project car just to get some music in the car. Was easy enough to wire up straightforward to sync with my phone and it has a decent number of settings built in. Can't comment too much on the sound quality as my speakers are over 20 years old and need replacing themselves. For the price you can't beat it!
5,Good stereo fire it's price
3,Bought this on a quick whim to replace a stock radio. Seemed like it would be good enough and you can't beat the price. The fit was just ok..a bit smaller than the stock radio that came out. My biggest complaint is that there is no option to display the clock full time. I only need to know what station I'm on while changing them. Don't care while I'm listening and would rather know the time.
5,Great price easy to install .. just a simple basic system with all the bells and whistles our old one was missing!
4,Cheap and easy. I hate that you can't make the clock display standard. You have to press and hold clock then it only displays for a few moments.
4,I just wish the clock would display. Otherwise this is great!
4,Works well with my 99 Corolla. Had to drill holes in the case so I could use my existing brackets as there were none in the box that would work.
5,This is a very nice little stereo. extremely easy to navigate thru functions on the fly. connects to my phone without fail and then goes right back to music at startup. I read a lot of negative reviews (after I ordered it) and was skeptical about it's quality but for 28 or so bucks it is exactly what I needed... A radio!
5,You will need to get the General Motors antenna plug adapter if your car is older GM. Other than that this radio and the Bluetooth and the hands-free calling and everything else works wonderfully and I have two friends who have ordered this because they saw mine. It is not very loud however but that isn't a problem for me. You might consider a booster if you want volume.
4,Nice replacement system with quality sound. Not a lot of features but it is a good system for the price.
4,Get what you pay for Period. Basic features nothing more.
5,Very surprised at the sound quality and overall usability. Was expecting trash. I bought a second for my trailer.
3,As expected. Works well for inexpensive price. No one is going to steal this. Not fancy enough.
2,The stereo worked just fine for a cheaper unit. No issues there. Good sound and power decent controls. But it stopped working after 2 years. I checked the fuse and it is ok. Radio powers on controls work but no sound. Speakers are good. I think the internal amp burned out and we don't listen at very high audio levels. Your mileage may vary.
5,I bought one of these for the Golf Cart at work and liked it enough to buy one for my niece's car. Great head unit for $30. Bluetooth is easy to use with your phone for pandora or spotify FM works fine. It has no CD player but who cares? CDs were the most fragile form of storing music/data. I'm glad to see them phasing out.
5,Love it for the price.  Easy to use and great features.
5,Product was great as expected. This is my third boss unit that I have bought and they all work perfectly. They loose equalizer settings if there is a short somewhere in the car. I have installed the 611uab in a 2000 Honda Accord and one in a 2002 Honda Odyssey I also installed this unit (616uab) in an 03 Infiniti g35 coupe
1,Only lasted 1 week. Then would no longer produce sound. Since the USB ONLY charges does not allow direct iphone connection you cant just hook up the phone directly you need bluetooth no workaround.
4,All in all this is a good radio only complaint I could have is that I had to put in a different  antenna as it would not fit the factory one but still a good product.
5,Love the size and the simplicity of it. Also affordability was the best.
1,I understand you get what you pay for but I didn't expect them to quit all together. The first one lasted two weeks. The display was blank but you could tell it had power because it was lit up. I did  return that one and got a replacement but it just went out after two years with the exact same scenario. The blue tooth worked great and the sound was fine also. One complaint I have is about the clock function. You have to hit a button to display the clock and it only stays up for about 5 seconds and then goes back to the current source that you using. I couldn't find a way to make the clock stay up all the time. I will not purchase this product again.
5,Works good second one I've purchased Unaware of the touch screen are you sure ?
3,clock wont set..cant see the screen unless night time..you cant see it in daylight even on hi illumnation setting
5,Easy to install simple to operate. Sound quality more than expected
5,I Put the stereo on my electric wheelchair and it sounds great and I even gave it rechargeable battery pack so that its independent of the wheelchairs power systems
4,Stereo works great. Had to call the manufacturer to get a new speaker harness cause the one that came with it was defective. But customer service was great
5,I’m a mechanic but had never installed a radio in a car before. I had it done in about ten minutes. Looks nice in the old car I just wanted a cheap radio with Bluetooth for. Connects to my phone fast with no problems. For $30 if it lasts a year I will be happy.
2,Bought this due to the low price and it was going into an older car. The installation was pretty straightforward. AM reception was a little sketchy from the get go. After about a year it would occasionally refuse to turn on. Now that condition is permanent. Tried pulling the fuse to see if a reset would help but no. I recommend spending 50 or 60 more bucks and get a quality unit. Will not buy this make again.
5,For the price you can't go wrong. And it's fully compatible with echo auto even as its power supply via the USB
5,Very simple installation and easy layout with the wiring. Of course my 98 Chevy already had an aftermarket stereo before this one so mine was a swap swap. No dimmer mode but that don’t bother me. Pretty awesome the mic input is built into the stereo and isn’t an extra piece you have to mount somewhere else. I recommend this stereo it’s cheap and it works like it’s supposed to
5,I like everything about this unit. Good sound lightweight easy installation. Although I did have to run the blue/ white (amp turn on) from my vehicle with the solid red wire from the device to get sound
4,Cool so far Matched with the Metra wiring harness allowed for easy install.*If unit powers up but no sound swap blue wire to blue/white wire*
4,It works great ...sound quality is good for what you pay for ...overall it's a good stereo
4,It was easy to install and works well for the money.
3,Good product for the money
5,For a cheap radio it's pretty nice. The only thing I didn't like is even when I turned it off with the button it still connects to my Bluetooth on my phone and turns on when I get a call
4,It's really light and supremely plastic-y feeling like a toy but honestly it works just fine nothing wrong with it yet. bought it 3 months ago and still working today!
4,Golf cart
5,Installed it in my 66 Ford stepside the remote is great as is the Bluetooth
4,Replaced an old radio not working anymore in a 68 chevy.  Took me 10 minutes to put it in and it works.
5,Best radio out there.  This is my third BOSS radio (not because they break but because I have several cars) and they all work as good or better than the other more expensive brands.  I don't know but would bet these radio's are made in the same area (China) and probably the same factory as many other expensive brands.  If you need a reliable cheap radio...this is it!
1,Hay algún tipo de garantia apenas me duró mes y medio el producto. Calienta y comienza a chillar como si fueran los parlantes
3,Aye you get what you payed for my screen went out after a couple months but it’s a good starter radio Bluetooth works great you jump in turn your car on and it automatically connects
5,Works better than expected!!  I bought this for BOTH my vehicles!
3,Everything was really great about the radio but I think that the "low" illumination setting is still too high. I love the functionality look and of course buttons but I didn't like how I can't mute or see the time when Bluetooth is connected. Great radio for decent price.
4,the only issue is that you have to use the aux option to plug in devices that are not wireless.  so the usb only works with a jump drive
2,I had this radio for about two months now and just had it professionally installed 3 weeks ago and was listening to it on my way to work this mornong when it made an extremely loud popping noise so I reached over to check it and the unit itself was extrmely hot to the touch.  I had my installer look at it and he said that the fuse blew when the unit overheated. He also said that it blew the fuse for my wiring harness behind my dash.  A $20 radio is now costing me $600 in repair cost with parts and labor to check all the wiring and connections not including a replacement radio.  I will not be recommending this radio to anyone.
5,This is an amazing deal for the price it has great sound and easy to use!
4,Good little radio: great fit and easy install. It took me a while to figure out how everything worked (the features) Bluetooth works great radio works as it should. The SD card is a nice addition for personalized music.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have absolutely no complain about it. It was delayed and I have prime service and Amazon refunded everything and leave with the product but after using a few months I can say I would gladly pay for it all over again. Worths the money!!! My old kia spectra 05 sounds like an animal now jj in a good way
5,Need a cheap bluetooth HU? This works just fine in our Land Rover.  Call quality is good people say they can't tell its a speaker phone.  One you connect and start playing tunes it work great using the HU buttons to skip songs and pause. Don't even need to get phone out of my pocket.
4,Picked this up months ago easy to install and use! Took no time to hook up and is still working just as well as the day it was installed.
3,For the price the radio is good.....so far.However even at the highest setting the display is too dim to read in the daytime.
5,Puedo escuchar grabaciones de trabajo desde mi celular mientra coduzco.... igual contestar y hablar manos libres. Suficiente todo. Grcaias
4,I purchased as a cheap fix to replace the broken radio before i sell my truck. For the price it is better quality than i expected. The radio is nice and connects to bluetooth quickly.
4,Sounds is horrific! Installed it in my 05 Civic and it looks stock. Pairing was super fast and easy only 4 starts because the calling feature people sometimes hears me very low. But besides that it's well worth the money
3,Works good for golf cart Bluetooth works ok does not auto connect but for the money works good
5,Absolutely awesome product! I love it! Was better than I imagined.
4,Great product for the price.  The only thing I found lacking is the inability to search a SD card or USB connected device for a particular artist song or album
5,Worked with a 1999 Durango. First car project for teenager and it works.
4,was super easy to install sounds great. sometimes the bluetooth is weird but im not sure if thats my fault or not so 4 stars
5,Purchased the Scoshe plug adaptor also. Right at 30 dollars total. Installed in minutes and fit good in my 95 Powerstroke. Imoroved the sound quality of my factory speakers immensely. Only negative is the quality of phone calls through the stereo but I don't really do that anyway. Mainly got it to replace my factory unit so my kid can play her music via blue tooth. Basic quality very pleased.
5,Connects to phone easily. Lightest unit I have ever installed. Seem to be good quality so far
4,Muy  bueno lo rrecomiendo buen sonido
5,This radio is a direct plug and play replacement for the Land Rover Disco 2.  Surprising sound quality  with bluetooth functionality.  The Blue display doesn't match the green LR backlights but at this price who cares
5,Was little skeptical due to price. Installed been using a few days. Installed new speakers today after they came in the mail. Great radio bluetooth works great radio has no issues. I ran skar audio lower end speakers all the way around and tweeters sounds great. Perfect for my old work truck looks nice.
5,Never got to use is friend said it’s awesome
5,Radio was easy to install and works perfect! sound is good and bluetooth connectivity is perfect. It does exactly what I need it to do. I have it connected to a boss amp and some salvaged speakers and it sounds better than most factory systems and better then some mid-range systems! Very happy with the Boss brand!
4,This is a cool little stereo up to date tech wise and easy to install. All components are included.I like it.
5,It's basic. Simple as that. Don't expect a 10 band EQ or the ability to change the backlight color and you won't be disappointed. The Bluetooth works great. Able the skip songs etc when using Pandora. Gets plenty loud with my factory 6 speaker setup. Great gear for the money!
1,It's small light and easy to install. I like the next/previous buttons because they are big and easy to find by feel while driving. You have to press them fairly hard though - pressing near the top of the button will not register.It sounds awful. The bluetooth is pretty unreliable - and when it's not connected yet it plays the very loud static from the AM/FM radio. The controls are not obvious. Difficult to pair with a phone without referencing the instructions. The microphone is in the front of the unit - while this is simple and works fine when the car is parked with the engine off - driving and talking is impossible.The screen has a GIANT VU meter with a car in the middle. This VU meter is FAKE and just bounces up and down in the same fake pattern - it has nothing to do with the music or sound in any way - and keeps on bouncing the same way even in silent parts of your songs. Each bar lights up to the same exact position. I can't even tell you how much this useless feature annoys me.
3,Good product for the price.
5,For the price I expected compromise...but haven't found it. Everything works as advertised and the sound quality is good. What more can I ask for?
4,It was easy to install and easy to navigate.  It’s actually more impressive than I thought for what you pay for.
3,I bought this for a car I knew I was going to sell. I just needed to have a stereo in it that worked. It works and the Bluetooth connectivity is great! The sound quality is poor but $30 is a great deal for a Bluetooth stereo.
4,Cheap setup but for the money does a great job.  Gave it 4/5 as it could have more functionality but for the price I am not surprised.  It's quality is really good and put together well.
5,For the price this unit does more then I expected. Nothing fancy but gets the job done.
5,Pros:  Item Bluetooth linking is user friendly.  Included instructions are easy to understand and simple to accomplish.Cons:  Is not bundled with wiring adapters.  Is not bundled with dash conversion adapter.  Moving lights on lcd display is a bit busy.Other:  Per price and expectations by far gets it done.
5,Easy to install and simple to operate. Not having the CD or DVD player makes a unit smaller and lighter which helps with the installation.
5,Bought for my tractor and couldn’t be happier. You can’t go wrong for a $25 radio that has Bluetooth/AUX/MP3 capabilities. Great stereo deck.
4,Good product for the price but has troubles connecting to iPhones via Bluetooth other then that good buy
5,Easy to install took a whole 10 minutes..
4,Old radio stoped working this one works
2,I have an older truck that needed a new antenna so while replacing it I also decided to replace the stereo with this model. All in all it's not bad if you just want an AM/FM stereo but I have yet to get the Bluetooth to stay connected or link at all sometimes. When it does connect and locate the device to connect it skips constantly. This happens constantly from my driveway or on long trips. I have turned off my phone Bluetooth car stereo many times and at best it allows me to listen to one song before skipping again. I am currently looking to buy another better quality stereo now so I would not waste your money on this model.
4,Works sounds decent.
5,The price of the unit was insane! Best radio in the market for $30.00 bucks
4,Nice little economy radio but also good quality. Nice to have Bluetooth functionality for music and phone calls.
3,Works ok volume is clunky
4,Works as advertised. Not going to surprise you but hopefully won't disappoint you as well. Feels cheap but it is so I can't really complain. Otherwise no problems so far.
5,It’s real easy to do what I want with it.
5,This is the second one I bought for our vehicles
2,this is a replacement radio for delco - bose  system. Sounds great fairly easy to program. Flash drive files are not friendly it will not play some and if you search to find a file good luck. Pairs with blue tooth fine but I guess that's about all its good for. Radio reception is very week and if you are near another station it might bleed over on it. Clock has a mind of its own I guess the bottom line is you get what you pay for So you might want to save up a few more dollars and get a lot better radio.
5,Works as described and sound quality is good. Not an audio buff but it’s a great replacement for the oem stereo. Display is clear and easy to use. Installation was simple. I would recommend to someone looking for an affordable aftermarket head unit.
4,You get a bit more than what you pay for overall is a cheap car stereo and for the price I’d say its worth it.
1,Had for a month went to use the usb and get usb error as in pic tried the BT and it will connect for 30sec then whole radio resets to factory loose all time and radio station settings and all after return time . I will buy a better one next time
5,Honestly surprised on how well this cheap little radio sounds. Its not mind blowing but for the price this thing performs. I got this for my beater commuter car and it sounds better than the Alpine it replaced.The buttons feel cheap its extremely light and the display isnt the best but install and setup was a breeze and it sounds good. Bluetooth connected right away too
2,For $30 you can’t really complain. The deck works as advertised. Barely. Bluetooth syncs to phone and you are able to play music wirelessly. The usb option is not for playing music from your phone.  It kind of worked for a bit as a charger but then eventually stopped working.  When I first got it I called boss customer service and the guy who answered literally argued with me over what features the stereo has. Apparently “USB port” does not mean that your iPhone will play through the stereo when connected via cable and I should feel stupid for assuming so. You get what you pay for.  For $30 I would buy again for my next beater surf truck.
5,Works so well I'll continue to add these to my equipment.
5,Put this in my 2002 buick rendezvous to replace the stock one due to the stupid lock feature. Works pretty well. BT sound is a little worse then AUX but that's to be expected It's not enough for it to be that big of a deal tho I only drive 15 mins to work.
5,Super affordable easy to install and has worked great so far. I installed it into my Japanese 1999 Nissan El Grand. Comes with a remote. Bluetooth has really good range and connects and reconnects super fast.
5,Was easy to install and was what our daughter was looking for
5,Awesome stero for the money. Instantly connects which is moce compared to my old stero. Great sound.
5,Awesome for what I paid for it it is great
4,Super light the Bluetooth phone calls are not the best for the price of the unit but to stream your music it works great.
4,Nice radio for the money..
4,Basic stereo get wiring kit for your vehicle what's best is plays USB mp3 sticks no more CDs feels plastic and cheap but works well.
4,4/5 instead of 5/5 because it would be nice to scroll through the radio stations instead of using the small buttons on the left. Other than that it works as advertised.
3,The lights are really dim hard to see.  Bluetooth is finicky. sounds really good what do you expect from a cheap radio
3,It's okay. I have it in my boat and don't think I'd want it in a car where it would be in my face. The display is bright and busy. Seems to function fine so far but does have a cheap feel to it. But it's a cheap unit so...
3,Bluetooth connects to my phone effortlessly
5,I’m very impressed with this radio for the low price point. It does what it says and you really can’t complain for how dirt cheap it is. Bluetooth syncs as soon as the car is turned on effortlessly and the usb charges my phone. Only complaint is the smell of cheap plastic but that should disappear soon.
3,it took a little bit to install but i did it myself. the LED is not bright enough so you can only see it at night. also it stops sometimes but mine may just be a defective one. alright if you don’t wanna spend a lot. just make sure you get a warranty
2,This is pretty simple head unit and is easy to use for the most part. The sound is about what you'd expect for under $40 so don't expect to blast Slayer without distortion but it's fine for podcasts and phone calls. The lack of any file management for the USB/card storage is non-existent forcing you to find music by jumping 10 songs forward or back; Pretty irritating having to sort through 35000 songs by tens. It became a moot point when I went on vacation for a week only to return to a dead stereo. It has power since the screen still lights up but it no longer functions in any way. I'll be replacing it with a different brand.
5,Very easy to installed and worked perfect in our RV.
5,Perfect little Bluetooth stereo. Fit perfect on my Ford ranger. Connects quick without having to pull out my phone every time.
5,20min setup music plays loud and everything works
4,Bastante basico y bueno para su precio el sonido no es tan bueno como otros pero funciona bien.
5,Muy buen producto
5,Love the BT feature use it all the time. Plenty of power for anyone except those guys who want to annoy all the other cars around them. The only thing I don't like is the completely useless pretend "VU meter" display on front. It is 100% pretend. The meters constantly bump up and down even if there is no input. I'd rather have no display than a nonsense one.
3,I really needed to fill the hole in dashboard and also I needed a USB power source. As a music player it is quite useless it supports antiquated MP3 but no modern Opus AAC or FLAC. The spectrum display is irritating indeed and cannot be disabled. I don't listen the radio often but so far so good it works.
4,once we found the correct wiring diagram for our car it was an easy install works well and sounds good
5,Great radio very simple to hook up and works excellent
5,installed on my 2005 f350 super duty love it
4,Excelente sonido y muy buen precio solo que no tiene lector de memoria SD y es un poco incomodo para cambiar de directorios.
5,Great
5,Fue una buena experiencia el instalarlo super facil gracias al manual que trae y se nota la diferencia de sonido con mi anterior reproductor en mi opinion un excelente producto
5,For a $28 stereo I'm pretty impressed. Installed easily powered on and adjusted audio settings and programmed radio stations with ease. Sound quality is good and even puts out a pretty loud and powerful sound.Played some songs from my phone through the Bluetooth feature and it worked easily.All in all a good Bluetooth stereo for a value price!
4,I didn't get to use it
3,Disappointed you can only see the digital screen at night.
3,This unit doesnt seem to be very loud which is a down fall. Good for a spare car to work in a pinch.
5,Replaced my factory radio with this one and it is fantastic. Bluetooth is very clear and it is loud. Also added Boss speakers and very happy with all of the equipment.
5,Works great so far simple and easy to use. Installed as an upgraded stereo on the outside of my motorhome.
5,Sound quality great put in John Deere Tractor.
5,It took about 40 minutes to install. Came with the wire harnesses and luckily I'm not color blind. I haven't ran into any issues with it yet but I'll edit my review of it does. It's been installed for about 4 days now with no issues. It's nice having a radio with Bluetooth.
5,Works good for the price
5,Installed it in a 1988 Chevy truck
3,Couple quirks: I’ve had the sound go out a few times for several minutes for no reason. Then the display shows weird letters and characters when powered off. Third thing when I turn off the radio the presets are gone. And yes I used a constant wiring connection as well as a switched connection. Otherwise the features and sound are great for the price.
5,This was a great cheap radio . Worked perfectly . Nothing more nothing less .
1,Turns on buttons don't work. Remote won't work  volume goes up and down but that's it .
2,Installed this unit in a 1973 Datsun 240Z it worked great for about six months then just stopped working I only drive the this car once or twice a week for short distances so there wasn't very many hours put on this radio.  I checked the fuse etc pulled the radio and connected it to an exterior 12 V DC source to troubleshoot fuse is fine unit will no longer light/start up I guess that's what to expect for the money but I expected it to last at least a couple of years so definitely disappointed.  I'll look for another radio and maybe spend a bit more get what you pay for...
5,Works great! Has issues connecting sometimes but if you reset it with a small pen tip then the Bluetooth will connect right away. Bought it twice for two different cars. Installation was super easy (depending on the car of course) and it auto plays music whenever your turn the car on.
5,Nice
3,good radio.
5,Works perfect. Item as described! Would recommend it.
5,Does the job. Not the top of the line but works
4,Great price. Easy to install. Works as expected. I thought I could attach my iPhone via the USB but the unit doesn't recognize the IPhone - have to attach via Bluetooth to play music. Otherwise I like it.
2,This is a cheap system and it shows in many ways. The buttons are very loose and "feel" cheap. The layout is a bit annoying as anything besides changing tracks is hidden in 6 side buttons that are labeled poorly.Functionally I've used it for USB stick media mainly. It skips the first second or two of each song as it's starting even if you rewind it. There is no folder skip option (from what I can find) and only the option to cycle through every track manually (or randomly jump).I regret purchasing a cheaper unit but it will do the job I need for now.
4,easy to hookup sound quality good i havent tried the MP3 USB or auxiliare input yet.
5,Connects to Bluetooth immediately when u get in the car !
3,Came in New as expectedWas delivered 2 days ago having trouble powering on........Not my first rodeo installing stereosCan someone assist??
5,Pretty amazed on the quality of this head unit. It was an easy and fast process. Bluetooth works instantly connects to mobile work like a charm. I am pleased  to recommend this head unit to anyone who is looking to get a great deal for an in expensive Bluetooth radio.
1,I bought this product to upgrade my original equipment which was pretty worn out.  This unit truly is disappointing at best.  Lack of power no mid-range terrible radio reception.  I did like the Bluetooth but even the USB didn't work right.  Mind you I had this installed professionally by a highly-rated installer.  He also put in some really good speakers throughout so I thought I would be set.  Not so.  I went back today and bought a Kenwood stereo pretty much with all the same features but way way more and WOW what a difference.  This  BOSS unit is a joke and not worth anything.  If I could I would return it right away.  Very disappointed and that is a HUGE understatement.  If you look at my reviews I have never been so upset and have almost never left a negative review.  No complaints about the seller although I would like a refund for this item.  I will wait to see if the seller replies.
3,Easy to install and cheap!! There is no antenna included for the am/fm radio and the bluetooth kicks off after 2.5ft but other then that solid $30 unit.
2,I really enjoyed this unit but the display only lasted about 8 months before it went out. It will sometimes come back on. I would honestly just buy another one an pop it in for the price but is it even worth it  if it's just going to go out again?Update: Boss responded to my comment that they were going to make it right but then never followed through. Sad they didn't come through
3,It's a great little radio other than the fact that mine came with a broken faceplate ring two clips were broken on it. now it slides further into the dash then it's supposed to.
1,We installed this unit in our truck camper to replace a broken CD receiver.  Got it all wired in turned it on and tried to set the clock.  The unit kept shutting off and restarting about every 20-25 seconds.  Never was able to get it to work.  Tried the radio was able to ascertain that all the speakers were working but never could get the unit to find a radio station as it would not stay on long enough to find one.Item was returned for a refund.
4,Unit worked for a month. It worked well even blue tooth to an apple phone. Now quit waiting on customer service.
5,I bought this for a beater just wanted a radio. I saw this for a rediculous low price and was amazed when I installed it. It to me sounds and had features as good if not better then the factory radio. Do not miss understand what I’m saying definitely not a high end stero but great as a inexpensive stero replacement
3,7/10 worth the buy. Nothing special but surely meets all needs!
2,The web price was lower than the ones I saw @ local stores around town. So...price was good. On the other hand... You get what you pay for I hooked up the radio & had no issues because the instructions were pretty clear. Wires were labeled on harness which made for a fast installation. The screen was pretty plain with just the white LED showing equalizer.My brother had another well known brand radio just laying around and I tried that one out! I put the boss radio back into box! There was no power...or really any way to really tweak your speakers!Its an OK radio... Just not a great radio!
2,So.....after much tinkering with the radio installation kit and wiring harness I purchased in order to install the radio the radio powers on but I can get no sound at all from the speakers. I bought the wiring harness in order to make sure that the wires got connected with the correct ones from the factory harness but that didn't work. I uninstalled the the BOSS 616 UAB and re-installed the factory radio just to make sure there wasn't a different issue at hand but the radio powered on and all the speakers worked so I'm not really sure what is going on here but at this point I have spent so many hours trouble shooting every possible scenario that I will be returning this radio.
1,Power and acc wiring inside radio soldered together. Radio won’t turn off. Garbage
5,It works great and easy install
5,I Love it! & It looks great! 👍 easy to install was a little challenging trying to get it positioned right installed it in my 96 Toyota Rav4 it says that it fit  needs extra Bracket but everything turned out just fine. Wanted to update & add a little  more modern ability to my SUV and it works beautifully so far.
4,No complaints.  Works as advertised.
5,Works great on our golf cart.
3,The first radio I received did not turn on. I had to warranty it out. The second radio turned on and only showed "AM 1200." There is a reset button near the USB port on the face. You may need to push this button if you have the same issue.
5,Nade my stock speakers louder.
5,Works good for the price. Good Bluetooth range on my boat
5,Easy install on newer Trucks (2002 150 supercrew) bit of a chore on older (1987 Ranger) But quite doable
5,Great for the price
5,Great for the price installed fairly easy (match the colored wires) fit the space tightly and has a decent sound.
2,Power button worked for  approximately  2 wks but  with what ya pay for i guess is exactly what you get  the sound when it did turn on  was amazing but like i said didnt last very long
5,I HAD A CHEAP AFTERMARKET RADIO IN MY FORD ESCAPE. THIS FIT RIGHT IN PLACE AND PLUGED INTO THE OLD WIRING HARNESS TOOK 15 MIN TO PUT IN. SOUNDS GREAT. FOR 20 BUCKS YOU  CANT GO WRONG .
5,Love all of it
5,It is a grate radio I recommend it.
5,Awesome
5,Will be installing in my sons vehicle. Appears to be a good stereo.
5,Im running this head unit through an old existing amp that was already installed on our boat. The sound is very satisfactory especially considering i paid less than $40. The bluetooth connects quickly and easily. We weren't looking for a competition stereo.
5,Works great.
5,Economical unit that sounds good too!Can’t beat the price for a blue tooth unit.
4,Good radio for the price. It doesnt do everything i would expect but still good for the price.
5,Very good radio and the sound is great.
5,It is a good option for low price
2,FM works AM gets a lot of noise. Thought it might be from the Alternator or Fuel Pump. After putting in a noise filter it still made a lot of noise in AM. So I attached it directly to battery power with the engine the car turned off. It still made noise without anything except the speakers and the antenna attached. USB port DOES NOT charge. Microphone for Bluetooth does not really work either. I had a different BOSS before and it worked great until it just stopped working after three years. I'm just going to have to break down and buy a real stereo unit.
3,This works well for a cheap head unit.  It was easy to install but sounds OK.  The nice thing is it lets my son talk on the phone hands free through the stereo and mic on the phone via bluetooth.
4,The only complaint I have is that at night the lights are still alittle to bright but still worth the price.
3,Not bad for $20. high volume dim for night ez install. Again it’s a cheap alternative to replace stock stereo.  BT & calling features really good impressive for the reason I owned jvcSonyalpine etc none could match the stability.
1,Wouldn't even power on when connected. A total waste of time and money.
5,I don’t know why but this radio beats Bluetooth hooked up with every radio I’ve ever installed or used. Once the car turns on like 3 to 5 seconds later music starts playing from my phone... crazy fast hook up. Does the basics.  Not crazy customizing but hey for $30...
5,Easy to set up and use fits great and looks good in my IROC Z.
5,Just as advertised and am very please with the purchase.
5,Works great.  Did not like the MicrophoneExposed.
5,It’s a good radio but with in two week the Bluetooth started acting up. I thought it was my phone losing signal. I later found out that after playing through Bluetooth for about five minutes the signal will start to go choppy. Everything else work perfect. I probably just got a bad one.
3,I preset the stations and the time every day but once I turn the car off when I return to the factory settings have returned...  otherwise a good radio it's not too glamorous for my old car (02 passat) u wouldn't know its after market if you've never seen the inside of an old passat
5,wanted sounds
5,Bought for my travel trailer mainly because I wanted bluetooth capability and my old stereo only had 2 channels... Everything worked great right out of the box. For 20 some bucks you really cant beat it time will tell if it holds up I guess but for now I'm more than happy with it.
1,It worked great while it worked. Sound output is not great at all but didn't expect much. After a few months the audio would cut out randomly. Thought it was a loose connection or wires touching as it started acting up when hitting a bump. Later while sitting in my truck it did it while sitting still and not moving anything. Head unit just has a bad connection
5,Great product. Easy to install and use!!  Very fast shipping and great instructions.
1,This thing worked okay for months quality was lacking it has annoying features (like it will call people on your phone if you hit a button on it)  then it started cutting out then just stopped working then my battery stopped working This thing sucks
2,it worked well for a couple of hrs then I turned my car on and it started smoking so I took it out and changed the fuse which had no effect
1,I installed this about a week ago into a "project car". It's basically an old VW so very straightforward install. It worked beautifully right from the start. Great sound connected to my phone for Pandora. All was good.I just installed a power antenna and now the radio cycles on and off every 5 seconds or so!! I disconnected the power antenna thinking I did something wrong but it made no difference!! It simply will NOT stay on! I checked fuses wiring etc.. Like I said it worked beautifully just one week ago now....CRAP!!!!!Buy at your own risk!!!
5,Easily connected to phone
5,Very easy to install and wire.  Have it in an off road vehicle so don't use many of the features.  Works very well.
2,Don’t expect a improvement of sound quality or loudness. When I connected the right front speaker has no output from the radio. Maybe something if you have nothing at all and need something cheap to get you by but don’t buy for an upgrade to anything !
5,Great product
4,Installed on a motorcycle works great
4,Works good a little bright with display but overall great little head unit.
3,The Bluetooth connection is unreliable and the product stopped working after a few months. The display on the unit went bad. I would not recommend this product due to the cheap build and reliability issues
3,The head unit is nice  my issue being it is larger than most single din units.  As a result lots of fitting and filling is required to install it in your car.
5,I loved thanks 😊
4,Good value
3,I was looking for a cheaper system to replace my stereo in my older pickup. this system provided an affordable sound producer. Guess my ears were spoiled to quality sound.
5,Buen precio
5,Great stereo for the price. Seems like good quality.  It is had to see the screen in sunlight though. Good buy for 30 bucks.
5,I was not expecting a solid performance for $30. But I must say. This little unit delivers the goods and does it very well. Features are what you would expect from a higher tier radio for a fraction of the cost. Would buy again.
5,Great for a quick upgrade amazingly it's great and looks factory
1,The brightness of the screen is zero and I can barely see anything when I'm driving during the day. Actually I can't see anything at all. Every time I restart the car the radio goes to the first station and all the settings are gone. It also doesn't show the time. I followed the instructions as in the manual but everything is useless because it resets anytime you start the car.The volume button on my old radio wasn't working which is why I switched and I honestly would rather have that back and stay stuck on vol 50 than use this terrible radio. I've never felt I wasted my money on anything as much as I did on this. Definitely not worth the money. Very disappointing.I am not a rough rater and I don't usually write reviews so me spending my time to warn other people about this means something. Beware.
5,Real nice.
5,Perfect fit
5,Radio is great especially for the price. The only thing I would've liked is to have more accurate control of the sound quality instead of just being "Bass" and "Treble".Bluetooth is great and works with the remote control also call quality is alright.
5,Great value for my money!
5,Works good and sounds good. Great for the price.
5,Just got Radio. looked over Quality. Can't believe tghe low cost with all the features. I will write another review after installed in our UTV (side by side).
5,Sound quality
5,Works great 👍 with subwolfer
5,I was looking for a minimalist radio for my convertible that doesnt have like 01293709751992949999 LEDs and blinking flashy lights. I had settled on some cheapo $20 walmart deal and then I look online and see this. Reputable brand. Simplistic construction only two excessive lights. Bluetooth. Bam! Got it installed great little radio.
5,Love this radio!!! It looks great installed so many features available and once he downloaded the app he was immediately hooked to the radio. The remote is very handy. This is a great radio and the price was awesome. It was easy to install as well.
4,1999 Mazda protege fit more or less. Wiring diagram is not the same. Prep beforehand and use proper tools.
5,received quickly and it work nicely
5,Holy cow!  $26. And brings in FM way better than my older $100 stereo!  Clean and easy bluetooth hook up to cellphone.  Calls are loud and clear.  I like the preset equalizer themes.  Single din easy hook-up.  I don't miss no CD player!  My music is digital!  Definately recommend! !
5,Liked the one i put in my car so much i bought another for my truck.
5,Muy buen equipo a un precio muy accesible
3,Great radio for the price. System resets constantly and have to reprogram EQ (no the main power isn’t connected to ACC). Other than that works as advertised.If you’re looking for a “booming” system this isn’t the radio for you but great replacement for stock
4,Good stereo easy setup not so easy installation but can't beat that price
2,So it works but there’s a horrible high pitched buzzing sound that increases in pitch as the engine increases. When the radio is on low volume the buzzing is louder than any music and is extremely annoying. If you play the music loud enough it drowns it out so I guess that’s why it’s not just one star...? All I wanted was to be able to use an aux cord/Bluetooth with my 2005 Camry. Looks like I would have been better off doing the wireless radio option even though that comes with its own amount of static this buzzing is almost worst.
5,No complaints here.  Awesome  ahead unit for the money.  It is crazy how much the price in things like this have come down.  Because this is just a media player (no disk drive) it is super shallow.  You will never run i to any space issues installing this unit.
4,The wiring diagram was absolute trash. Yellow is constant hot if I recall correctly. Red is switched.
4,Have some noise wen volume it’s high. I use for Subaru 2003
3,It's almost impossible to see the screen in the daytime even when set to brightest background but then i only need two stations to work so there you go.
1,Radio cuts off and back on by itself
5,Works great easy to setup and use.
1,Screen stopped working after one day of use...Update got a replacement and audio stopped playing after a few min! These things are junk! Stop selling defective items!!!
2,Good stereo if you just want to have music in your vehicle. You can hook an amp and subs to it only con is that it doesn't have controls to adjust bass and treble. Other then that everything else works fine.
5,Great radio for a cheap price
5,I love that Radio system Beautiful was nice item is easy to use
4,It gets the job done. I wish it didn't have a VW bug display icon ALWAYS displayed onscreen - doesnt make my Jeep feel as manly.
5,Nice for the price!
5,For the money it is a great little unit.  Love the USB and bluetooth connection.
5,Received next day and very easy to install and use . Price was great added 3 year warranty total price under $35.
5,Works great
5,Everything was great and beyond my expectations
1,1) FM receiver failed after 1 year.2) Bluetooth connectivity is poor.  Drops out if you move more than 5ft from receiver.3) Remote control is almost worthless.  You must be within 5 or 6ft of receiver and have the remote pointed directly at the receiver for it to function.  The remote itself is small and flimsy.  Buttons are tiny printing on them does not contrast well with the black background making it impossible to see in less than perfect lighting AND the layout is not well thought out.I could go on..........  SAVE YOUR MONEY and pass on BOSS AUDIO garbage.
4,the equalizer on the lcd is very distracting while driving other then that works very well! BT works perfect
5,Use this for a new radio in my boat with Bluetooth. Everything worked perfectly would definitely recommend and buy another one..
4,very good product for its price  good sound and everything you need modern and compact style ..the only thing is the cover that is fixed but is the least hehe
5,Awesome radio easy to install!
5,It was a pretty straight forward replacement had some trouble with the wiring but eventually got it right. It only took 30 minutes to install. I used this unit on my golf cart better than i expected for the price. would buy again.
3,Works well especially the bluetooth and microphone connection to my phone. The major issue is that the clock only stays illuminated when the radio is off. There is no setting to have it display while the radio is operating.
1,I had this installed 3 weeks ago. My buttons stopped working. Then yesterday the volume stopped working. As soon as my new radio comes in this one is going in the trash!
5,Worked great
1,It took awhile for me to install however  after I did it woke for 3 weeks and just stopped working.  Unfortunately I can't return  it cause its been too long.
5,Worked great and easy to install
2,Easy installation and connected easily to my smart phone. However after 1 month the stereo deck just refused to turn on. I tried to get a replacement unit from BOSS and just got the run around.If it works for you great! But I need something that is going to work for longer than 30 days.
1,Excellent for the price.  Got the installation kit and the wiring harness the wires are color coded to match your vehicle and easy to connect with bullet or butt splices (I used bullet to simplify the upgrade).  I installed this in a 2000 expedition took less than an hour.  The installation kit is intuitive and easy to use for going from double din to single. The main reason I bought this is for the hands free calling and it paired to my samsung galaxy quickly and works perfectly.  Good upgrade for an old beater.  Quality wise I'm guessing Boss is the new Kraco.  It is what it is and what it is is a new stereo for around $40 all in.And then it died.EDIT:  July 29th and it won't turn on.  Fuse is fine.  So 7 weeks is what you get from Boss.  Moving on.
5,Easy install
4,I like it
1,When it's working it's decent but the Bluetooth is constantly losing connectivity and the whole radio has to be unhooked for it to reset.
4,Can’t beat the price! Works great and pretty loud.
3,Works good my my Jeep small compact and functions as needed. Output is not to good but will be adding an amp to get more sound. Bluetooth was a snap to setup but making phone calls on it is no the best since it is a built in mic.
3,Worked well at first. After 9 months of use I had my first issue with it. Got in the vehicle when it was 35 degree out and it wouldn't connect Bluetooth. After 20 min of driving it warmed the unit and started working.
5,Great cheap product exactly what I was looking for
5,I bought this because I have the iPhone 7 and wanted to charge my phone and listen to music at the same time. It does that perfectly. I use bluetooth on my phone for the music and the usb cable to charge my phone and this is one of the few radios that have actually done both at the same time.
5,fit perfect light weight easy in easy out
1,Bluetooth stopped working after a month. Sound quality Eeeeespeakers are mb quart. Spend the money for better quality.
4,Was what I wanted cheap and works well looks pretty good to
1,I don't recommend this radio at all. The volume is low the bass is minor no way to make it sound better. I thought having a remote would help but it's trash too. I wish I could get my money back. This is trash!!
1,I’m giving this review a one star cause it doesn’t even work period. Get it all wired up and it won’t even turn on. Had me sitting here thinking my truck was messed up and then I test wires to see if they’re hot and they are. This unit is just a total piece of garabage. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a decent head unit cause this thing is trash.
5,Overall this radio does everything it is supposed to do it has a great design and it looks fantastic once placed in your dash. The only thing I would like to be improved is the quality of the buttons just something aesthetic they feel with so much plastic.
5,I like how easy the installation was I installed this on a 2003 Land Rover freelander factory stereo came right out and I was able to plug in the same cables into this stereo. Sound and quality are really good.
5,BT connection was easy. Three levels of dimmable light was great. Dimmable light does not have automatic connection to vehicle but is very easy to get to in the menu.
1,I bought this for our golf cart and it would only get a couple of stations but with a weak signal. So I bought an amplified antennae connected it and the radio still works the same.....very pooorly. After 3 rounds of golf the screen on the radio went out so now I have to push through the buttons to get it to connect to the bluetooth on my phone so we can have some music. I bought a Boss radio for our boat and it works fine....but we did pay a little more for that one. I guess you do get what you pay for....so spend more!
1,I bought this to install in a Jeep. The smaller size Bluetooth and 200 watts were the selling points for me. The unit worked great for about 5 weeks then the Bluetooth disappeared from the input options. The Bluetooth was the only option I really cared about. The tuner in horrible and the USB input doesn't support any apple products. I tried resetting it several times and nothing. When I tried to contact the seller asking them if they had any ideas of things I could try to get it to work I was told they couldn't find my order from the order number I provided. After a few emails I decided they weren't going to be able to help. Overall I think the low price is a reflection of the low quality. I am not going to waste anymore money on their products. Instead I will go with a name brand with better products and customer service.
4,Ease in programming.
5,This stereo is great! I don’t have a subwoofer just Rockford Fosgate speakers. It works great for adjusting bass treble fade balance loudness and much much more. I would highly recommend
5,2005 subaru impreza sounds great easy install. i love these boss audio radios. the bluetooth is easy as heck to link. I tested it with samsung galaxy 9  note 8 ipad 6 and iphone 8+. super easy connection with all.
4,It glitches out whenever it gets hot or whenever you have car running without the AC on🐃
5,This was a gift for my neighbor. He said that they worked great. He couldn't believe how great the price was.
5,This is probably one of the best purchases I have ever made.  This radio works perfect. Sound quality is superb and links to my phone and hands free calls work better than many more expensive radios I have owned.
4,Works Great and it's small enough that I still have the pocket in my dash for storage.
5,Really good stereo for its price will worth it! I’d buy another one for another car.
5,A very economical well designed and user friendly system with multiple connectivity options while offering an elegant look and great sound for the money. A great alternative for those who want to enjoy music without the complexity and cost of the top tier and costly stereo systems.
5,It's a nice little cheap unit to swap out and old radio and get Bluetooth compatibility. Easy installThis is the second one I have purchased and installed. We put them in our RV's so we can stream music from our phones
5,works great so far
4,Good cheap little radio. Works as it should. I'm very happy
5,For the price so far I really like this unit. Bluetooth works really well and pairs easily. Remote is handy and works well. Probably wouldn't be my first choice for a daily driver but for my use of works great.
3,Hard to tune can barely see the screen in normal sunlight with the illumination on high but other than that it's a good radio for what you pay for.
1,Cheap radio pay for what you get.  Except the display is barely visible.  Upon installation the display was not readable in daylight.  Manual said nothing about  the display being adjustable contacted support support said that the display was not adjustable.  At night the display was barely viewable while adjusting settings found the controls to adjust the display by pressing the power button briefly and is at the first level.  At night the display at max settings is adequate during the day it is still unreadable.  The bluetooth is touchy with andriod need to tinker with your phone settings to not interfere with phone settings.
5,very simple to install
5,Got one of these in my boat thought I try one in my truck sounds good it's not a poineer or Sony but for the price it works awesomeFirst one quit working sent email had a replacement in less than a week
5,Just installed on the golf cart. So far so good. Sound is pretty solid for $29. You can’t have your phone more than about 4 ft away or the Bluetooth cuts out. But sat far so good- only day one.
1,Once it was wired up and turned on the sound quality wash horrible. I put my ear to each speaker thinking maybe one had gone bad but the sound was the same in all of them. Then the unit just turned off. Fortunately i had not installed it in the dash yet and was just laying on the console. When I went to pick it up to look at the display the back of the unit was very hot. That was all I needed to know. Am returning it.
4,It was easy to install and works well!
2,Plays fine just quiet can’t see the display during day time every time you turn the car on you have to reselect whatever system you were on BTRadio etc.
1,Need a refund
5,Decent for price easy install as well. 👌
2,the sound quality is ok. bought it for my project car. one major issue I found was that the settings such as equaliser loudness and balance resets every now and then. it stores it when I change but after few days or sometimes even on the same day I can hear the difference in the eq when I start the car. when I go on the settings everything is set back to 0 or default. only thing that seems to save permanently is the illumination level.
5,I just got this put in my 2006 toyota scion. I love the blue accent colors. Its sleek and shiny. Works with my bluetooth effortlessly. It automatically connects and plays the music from your phone once you turn it on. So far so good.
3,For Installation I need it to buy a harness update: the screen was frozen even I used the control and still didn't worked  I unplugged and put it back in and started working again
5,Amazing Stereo! Installation was very easy only issue I had was finding a place to ground the system for its power supply. Other than that this stereo made my cars stock audio system sound amazing and I am very happy I decided to go with this model!
5,Got this for my daughters New beetle. She loves the sound and I loved how good it went in. You need to buy the right wiring harness for your car. And I had to get a cover plate to make it look good.
2,Not sure what happened but it broke after 2 weeks. I turned it on one day and it was stuck on the radio but wouldn’t play any music. Everything else worked. I ordered it again and we will see what happens.It’s a nice radio for the price especially.
5,Good product for the money
2,The car stereo overall is good however the material is cheap and the audio light like the clock on the screen is ver bad and you will not be able to see it during the day
5,This Little Stereo  Sounds great on my 1997 honda Accord  easy to install  it pairs inmediately to my iphone   its a good option to bring  my honda to the 21st century  and the price is so good
5,Good instructions
5,Installed easy and works great.  Hooks up to my iphone very quickly and the forward and backward buttons on the stereo work to skip songs on my phone.  Sound quality is good.  For the price I don't know how you beat this.
4,The built-in Mic is not that good
5,Bought this for my "new car" a 1998 Chevy Malibu just a commuter car this headunit is amazing. Hands down for the price you get Bluetooth a USB port and SD card slot and AUX port. Unbeatable highly recommended! As well as hands free talking that you can call people from.
5,Basic but Bluetooth works perfect.
5,It is not touch screen but definitely very affordable and good quality. After a year of great use the Arizona heat might have damaged it but that’s to happen here in Arizona with everything :( but great buy.
1,I bought this for my truck I use on a postal route. Since I’m driving 5-6 hours a day I wanted something with Bluetooth but I didn’t want to spend a lot on something for my work truck. This thing worked for maybe a month before it simply went dark and silent. I had to disconnect my battery as it was still drawing power with the vehicle off and that seemed to reset it. Now about 4 months later it’s constantly malfunctioning. It will just go dark and silent at random times when I start my truck. I’ve reinstalled it twice hoping something was loose. Unfortunately it is also drawing power sometimes when my truck is off and almost kills the battery. Buy something else unless you like replacing your radio after 6 months.
5,More bang for the buck. Nice stereo and for the price WoW!
5,This is a great little system and very affordable. Would recommend to anyone. Easy to operate and install.
3,Thankfully I'm using Aux instead of Bluetooth because the unit pairs to my phone works for about ten seconds then dies out. No problems with Aux in. For the price im not too surprised but it works perfectly otherwise.
4,Does what it should sound quality is okay but fro $20 what u expect
5,my go to-  its like what stereo do you need? Well one that is cheap and always works... well that would be this one. No one uses CD's anymore and bluetooth ALWAYS works easy to hookup easy to use it just works
3,Good sound easy to install simple controlls but the Bluetooth is a complete failure after 20 min sounds like a record skipping thought it was my phone got a new phone same thing
2,Was a great deck for the price until about 2 weeks in when the Bluetooth failed that was the entire reason I bought it. I've used BOSS products before and loved them this one let me down.
5,Perfecto me gusta la calidad y lo fácil q fue instalar
5,Clock will not stay set when vehicle starts wish it would but thats what happens when you go cheap!
4,Hey it worked for what I needed!
5,install was easy and sounds great
2,Installing was simple and put it in same day I got it and it worked great for about 20 minutes now it constantly just keeps turning itself off it'll turn on with the truck then say goodbye immediate after every time. Now it doesn't even want to turn back on
5,Just got this radio today.and wow..looks stylish and everything works flawlessly. Bluetooth works great..music streaming on bluetooth sounds amazing..makes my 2007 town and country factory speakers sound like studio speakers..what am upgrade..of your thinking about buying this unit buy it you wont be dissapointed..
4,Good value. Good quality.Radio ok.
5,Works great and at a great price.  Haven’t tried the Bluetooth yet.
5,first one came without wires I quickly returned it and amazon quickly sent a new one back. I had everything ready to hook up so it only took me about 15 min. everything works and sounds  good. I appreciate a company that stands behind what they sell that's why I shop Amazon first
5,I got it at 5:45 today it's in the car at 6:00 todayinstallation was easy it's a strong system buttons are really strong and all all  it's a good radio I am really happy with my purchase
5,Used for my boat quality is great easy install
5,Works great. No touch screen  sounds better than I thought
5,It’s cheaply priced but I’d say I got more than my money’s worth. Comparing it to an older pioneer stereo I had previously installed in another car (paid maybe $40 for that one) I’d say this one is about the same in performance.
5,Great for the price.
1,Worked once then volume knob quit working then never came on again no help from seller
3,I got two (2) if these.The units have bad radio reception some times. No issues so far with the Bluetooth connection. I have not tried a USB and SD Card yet.  I am keeping them because I do not listen to radio stations since I listen to music thru my phone.
4,Good product for the money
5,Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it! Sound quality is great. The calling isn’t the best I could barely hear him when he called but everything has worked good!
4,Nice unit for the price.  Bluetooth has a hard time conecting but it's no biggie for me.  I just needed am/fm radio to listen to.
5,Sounds good. Works good. My only issue is there wasn't a way to cycle through mp3 folders from what I could tell. It's decent but you get what you pay for. Usually. Sometimes. Pay me. Ill do stuff.
5,for the price this is outstanding. for the features you get and how easy it is to install the price is great. the sound quality is great the features work it lights up the remote works. No complains.
5,Nice system for the priceworks great.
5,Hell of a deal for the price. Hands free works great sound quality is good. Can’t beat a good 30 dollar stereo. Didn’t have high hopes for it but it exceeded em.
5,I use this with home speakers and a 115 VAC to 12VDC power supply connected to large home speakers for a semi-portable sound system.  It could be used anywhere 12VDC is available but I'm using as a portable sound system all over my house.
2,Disappointed in this model  have one I bought earlier for Jeep works great this one is  cheesy
5,Excellent
2,I would like a solution to why my Bluetooth won’t connect. It worked for a couple of weeks and now It won’t connect to anyone’s phone. I am using an Aux cord but I bought this to have blue tooth. Thank you!
5,Good product & does what is expected
5,My aux port no longer worked in my car so needed a basicBluetooth stereo this works great sound is better than original stereo and connects to Bluetooth automatically when I start my car. Very satisfied
4,Easy bluetooth pairing.
5,I've been through several head units in my jeep wrangler and this one by far is the easiest to use see and has great sound quality for the price. this paired with nvx speakers does amazing.
5,I just use the stereo so I can play songs from my iPhone over car speakers. A few seconds after getting into my car the bluetooth automatically links and starts playing songs from my iPhone.
2,The Bluetooth is awful. Every 20 minutes like clock work it disconnects and then I have to wait for it to reconnect so I tried just using the aux but the aux sound is pretty bad. The music also randomly pauses for no reason. Overall terrible product
5,Awesome little stereo and I mean little it's half the size without a CD player in it and all the functions are great. Bluetooth is ready to set up but I have to pair the next day but it stays paired for the day while driving. For the price you absolutely can't beat this one!
2,It works but the flashing obnoxious equalizer graphics are distracting to the driver. There is no way to turn them off. So I covered them with tape. I also drew over all the excessive bright blue lighting with sharpie because even at the lowest setting it’s glaring. The clock is not readily visible. To see the clock the driver has to hold down a button. The clock is only visible for a second or two then it cycles back to unnecessary graphics. I find this terribly distracting and dangerous too.
5,Great stereo  Easy installation  Effortless Bluetooth connectivity.  Excellent sound quality.
5,Great sound. Easy to program.
1,This thing worked for one day.  Thankfully Amazon's return policy will allow me to get my money back.  Now I'm going to do what I should have in the first place - buy an Alpine.
2,Basic Radio with blue tooth connection. AM/FM reception better than 25 year old OEM it replaced links to iphone easily hands free mic picks up the road noise so hard to use a speed but all works.Update: Unit worked great for several weeks but now has to be reset at least once a week. Unit freezes and requires a hard reset via the reset button to function. Unit then works fine for a few days until the reset step has to be repeated. Reset loses all presets a real pain.
5,I gave this 5 stars because it’s a very good headunit. No issues with installing other than it could of came with more mounting hardware but other than that it works great. Just put new speakers in and they work great with it.
5,Installed it today and everything worked as expected. I’m happy with new stereo. Just have to get the station settings down.
1,Simply put this radio worked fine and sound quality was ok but not great. The radio quit working for no reason. The display started going and I couldn't get any sound out. I unplugged the wiring from the back and got the display back but I cannot get any sound out of the speakers. I tried on other speakers and it still didn't work. Spend the extra money and get something that won't quit working all together.
4,Looks good!  But fragile
5,Purchased for someone else but they are thrilled with the sound and quality. Didn't know it was bluetooth capable and when hooked up totally impressed! Great little stereo for the price.
5,better than factory or nothing.  easy to install
5,Great radio for listening to songs from your cell phone.....Does not have a CD player.....Easy to install very clear sound depending on your speakers
5,can't be it for the price
5,I've had this unit fir a few months now and it is working nicely. It has decent power looks nice on my car's dash and it was easy to install. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.
3,pretty cheap quality but hey its inexpensive. i like the low weight and smallish profile. it works well for my winter beater but if i cared at all about my car id spend a bit more for something decent.
5,Grandson loves it
3,for a 30 dollar head unit its not bad the equalizer could have more settings sound is great though and the bluetooth function works perfectly
5,Purchased this along with the cover. Works well together
4,Easy to install in our Rv
3,Price vs quality - goodSomeone knows why I have to set the date every time I star the engine ?
1,Sounds great touch screen is awesome but unfortunately like the other reviews mentioned it stopped working after barely a week.
5,Bluetooth
5,Excellent price excellent quality comes with remote and looks good at night! Very satisfied with product....thank u
5,I received my radio installed it into my car and I could not ask for about a quality sound than I have with my little small Boss radio
5,Good buy
3,Okay but why does it skip the first 3 seconds of a song ? Why is the volume knob scratch and the display before the clear plastic was even remove ?
5,very light and super easy to install make sure you buy a harness that is compatible with your car so you dont have to cut any cables. sound is great and pairing with iphone was quick no codes or anything like that.
5,GREAT BUY!! the remote works perfect and the sound is nice and clear and loud. Always get good quality for a low price with BOSS!!
5,Radio is awesome for the price i installed it in a 1988 Toyota pickup single cab. It’s simple as it gets easy for literally anyone to use.
5,Not bad ..  I use the  original  stereo harness  from Volvo VNL 780  truck 2010 .. you don’t have to cut or do anything with the wires ..
3,This stereo is ok. I’m using boss speakers with this receiver. Sound quality is poor with FM radio. Sound quality is better using Bluetooth. Good price and decent quality of your looking for a replacement
4,👌🏽
3,No time on the face but also have to understand that you get what you pay for so for that it’s Deffinetly not bad
5,Excelente
5,Easy to install with all necessary wiring good sound quality for the pruce
5,Perfect fit for my 95 Honda del sol can’t beat the price. Only issue is the little pic of the car on the display kind of goofy looks like a vw bug. Works great.
5,The stereo is GREAT! It is well above expectation for the price. If you're looking for a simple deck to stream your music and talk hands free this is for you.
5,Works well
5,Installed this the day it came in into my 99 Chrysler 300M. The stock head unit only 1 speaker worked and was crackling like crazy this makes my car sound great for the price that’s for sure!
4,sound quality fair price.
5,Easy to isnstall I put this in my wife's car and the preexisting harness for her old boss radio fit great! I recommend for anyone who has an old boss radio in their car and wants to replace it.
3,Lasted about 2 weeks in the jeep the circuit board is light weight and connections will vibrate loose . Unable to repair.  Great sound while it worked
5,good product
1,The rear speaker outputs don't work so only my front speakers are working and yes it's installed correctly. Don't hook your phone or iPod to the USB if you ever want it to work right again had to do a factory reset on my iPod and lost all the music I had on it.
5,Bought this to install in my son’s new powerwheels. I can’t believe it was only $26. Who needs a CD player?? This head unit sounds awesome coupled to the Dual 4-way round speakers. The calls made through it sound ok too.
3,it's ok as a get you by system but the usb tends to throw out error alot with my samsung galaxy s7 and the bluetooth is iffy from time to time. suprisingly fast at draining a 12 volt 20 amp hour battery if you dont keep an eye on it.
3,Solid little radio that was super easy to install. Connects to my phone for music no problem. Only problems are it is not very loud. The mic for Bluetooth phone calls is worthless. I can hear people fine but they cannot hear me.
5,I just installed this unit today and every thing works as described. The sound is pretty good for a $25.00 dollar car stereo. Blue tooth and USB also work just fine. I guess we'll see.
5,I replaced my home stereo I run the TV into mp3 Bluetooth iPad and music from usb for with a remote for little $ with a 110 to 12v adapter i also put one in my Vw rabbit conv
1,Went to connect it to my Honda Civic it was pretty simple then I went to test it and it just never came on I tried everything I could think of even had my electrician brother do the wiring just in case and still nothing DO NOT BUY it’s not worth it just save up and get a good one
1,Didn’t work once installed
4,Nice radio for price
1,Worked great for the first 2 weeks. Now it turns on and off whenever it wants. Very annoying.
1,Hard to get audio adjusted audio button part of volume control have to press button just right to get audio adjusted. If looking as possible purchase move on.
5,Great for the price. Plenty loud enough for me. Came fast. Doesn't seem as cheaply made as I expected it to be. Onscreen eq doesn't seem to move with the music though.  I have to speak very loudly for people to hear me when talking though stereo.
3,The Bluetooth for the phone isn't the best for the money it's a good radio
5,Update: BOSS replaced it for free!Loved the product while it lasted. Bought in March and stopped working in August. Lasted 6 months and died unfortunately.
4,Bien
5,it work good and the price is afordable
4,great product
3,Easy to use
5,Pretty much everything I wanted low cost and pretty good quality.I just wish it was red because the lights in my car are all red.... all the low-cost options are blue so eh its okay though i like blue.
4,Great wish the light would be dimmer
1,Sound was iffy even after tweaking all the settings.  Bluetooth didn't connect automatically so it was a pain every time you got in the car.  Then one day it just wouldn't turn on at all.  Checked and the voltage is fine.  Checked the fuse and it's fine.Contacted Boss support and they will not give me a refund.  I don't want to install another one of these.
5,X
5,GREAT radio for the price
3,I love the Bluetooth and usb but you cannot make a clock display by default you have to hold down a button. Fun to put into my 03 Honda Civic!
5,Put this in my 1998 car and it works great. No connection issues. Been in there about a year and still no issues.
5,This product isn’t touch screen don’t get why it up there for rating this product anyway great system love it no issues great buy
5,This was great replacement for my sister's stock CD player in her Honda Civic.  It was an easy install.  Also the Bluetooth streaming quality as well as USB aux input quality is pretty good.  All in all the product works for what I need it to.
2,I mean.... you get what you pay for.I ended up getting a different radio a month later.You cannot hook subs up to this radio so don’t buy this is you plan to have em.Sound quality sorta sucks too
3,Mediocre system but for the price you can't expect much.
1,Tried connecting this to my 03 Mitsubishi outlander for over 2 weeks without any success.Nothing matchup I even works can't even get power now. Don't buy
5,Worked really well in my sprinter van. Solid
2,Had to return product. After a few days it wouldn’t play any sound had to purchase a different unit.
5,Great deal only thing it doesn't have is a cd player
5,Works perfectly. Bluetooth is great & I can hook up to listen to all my favorite songs
1,The stereo was great at first but within the first two weeks the volume knob failed! Don’t waste your money!
2,It randomly freezes or doesn't turn on.  Which is terrible because when it does work its great.  It has all the features I was looking for and the Bluetooth and sd functions great. Playing songs from SD card; it will cut off the first few seconds of every song..  a little annoying but whatever.  Just not very happy with it constantly freezing up because then you have to pull it out of the dash and disconnect the power from the back to reset it everytime.
1,1. No capability to display the clock for more than a couple of seconds (email to customer service asking if there was a way to change this was not answered)2. I've had it completely reset at least 3 times since I installed it3. Even with it turned off it still seems to retain a bluetooth connection4. Radio sometimes seems to fade in and out5  The graphic on the display is completely meaningless and cannot be disabled6. A bad file/sector on a USB stick made it increase playback speed by probably close to 20% (disconnect battery to reset fixed it)7. The mount screws that came with it would probably not fit with almost any bracket; the screw holes are recessed into dimples in the metalIt does generally play music via SD/USB/BT fairly well.  Phone operation is ok.
5,This head unit was fitted on to an after market bracket for Ford Escorts. Worked perfect. The ignition wire (red) can be connected to the 12v outlet. Sounds great and Bluetooth works and starts playing music off my phone as soon as it connects (5secs).
3,Great unit but the backlight is so dim that the unit needs to be in the shade to read it
4,I like it so far but the display is a little too bright at night
4,Working good
4,Works good
5,Stopped working after three months
5,it isn't loud and the illumination is real low...but damn the thing only costed $25bucks...great for a work truck but not so much for your daily driver
1,The stereo worked great for about 2 months then just stopped working all together. It just went to hell
1,Sound will not play until you disconnect the speaker wires and plug them back in. You have to do this every time you start the vehicle. This is definitely not worth wasting your money on
5,Best deal found when purchasing this one.  It’s modern and super easy to navigate.  Looks pretty cool too when on.
4,It was easy to install working great
4,My boyfriend loves the stereo .
2,This head unit worked great for the 12 days I was able to use it. The unit turns on still and you can see an outline of blue around where the equilizer screen normally is but that's it.The unit no longer works beyond that. I've checked my wiring and the fuses everything looks good.Giving it two stars because I really liked the way it worked when it worked. It's a great little car stereo for the price. Wish it would have worked out.
2,sound quality and mounting were ok but the display drove me bonkers on long car rides. the dimmest setting on the screen is still really bright for night time driving. in addition to the brightness the the display features a set of bars that rise and fall they do not have anything to do with the beat of the music they just pulse when the music is loud. This also gets extremely annoying. my advice is get something nicer with a better display
5,Work fine no complains
5,Surprisingly good value for the money really depends on the speakers you’re using it with.Works right out of the box read the instructions very easy to pair via Bluetooth.
5,Love it
4,The Audio Car Stereo worth the price
5,inexpensive head unit.  Worked like a charm.
1,First the installation was a absolutely nightmare. It took so long to install; I spent about an extra hour trouble shooting the darn thing. The bluetooth broke within only a few days. I am not an expert by any means but I have installed radios in the past. Never have I had such bad luck with both the instillation and functionality. Never buying another Boss radio again! Amazon sent me a replacement for free however I won’t be keeping it. The car I am installing it into is about an hour tear down to access the radio then another hour to put it all back. Definitely not worth the money. I will be buying something actually worth my money.
3,Works great! The usb function doesn’t work which was kinda the main reason I bought it and sometimes If I get a call I can’t hear them through the Bluetooth but overall satisfied
5,Sounds much better than my stock stereo.
4,Easy to install and works fine...what else do you want?
5,For the price you cannot beat this! Installed and working wonderfully. So happy for the price and now I can bluetooth in from my phone and play my music. BYE BYE cd player and hello aux and bluetooth.
1,Cheap but don't be fulled. The volume knob did not work. No luck on dealing with manufacturer.
5,It's good
5,its difficult to see the time
1,Product changes station on its own. Changes from am to fm. Gets hot. Save your money.
5,Great value
4,Resuelve cuando no tienes radio
5,I like that this is an easy radio to install and use I have this in 2 of my cars haven't had a problem with them yet
4,I didn't get my remote control.
2,I purchased this boss single din radio along with the boss 800watt speakers. Let's just say what I paid for installation of the speaker and radio plus the radio I could of invested in a better car radio. You get what you pay for .... right. After a week the radio stopped functioning and never turned back on. When it was working Bluetooth connection sounded horrible. Don't waste your money on this product and invest in something better. Save yourself time and headache.
5,I was a little worried that the wiring would have been difficult but that was the easiest part. the wiring color match up was great for my truck.
5,Easy to install with a easy to understand wiring diagram. Installed this stereo on to my pontoon boat. Had it playing Tunes and 20 minutes. Can't beat the price can't beat the tunes
5,Easy install and cheap enough way to have onetouch in an older vehicle. Call quality is very good and very clear
4,So far so good no clock on it though.
3,This radio sounds betr by itself than my old radio and equalizer put together but it freezes up and shuts off by itself :( will be buying another radio from walmart..
4,Nothing fancy you get what u pay for.
5,I was pleased with the sound and look of the radio. It is easy to operate looks good and sounds great. The Bluetooth works good also.
1,Poor Bluetooth quality
5,Perfect for an older vehicle
5,Easy to install I advise everyone to purchase this product
4,second time buying BOSS... it is what it is.. thats the best quality you will get for the cheapest price..
1,Worked about a week and then crapped out. None of the buttons work anymore
5,Work truck approved add to mother’s work truck and still rocking
2,I have had the product since March. It randomly will skip to the next song. It stops and starts on it's own. And out of nowhere just quit working.
4,Great but sound so...so
5,Very easy install easy use of controls great quality for the price.
5,This was awsome works great no problems at all looks great thanks for helping us broke CRACKAS out with some quality tunes in my old Ford bronco
4,Very special product regarding the price I recommend
1,As reported by many others... the bluetooth skips..I plan on using the Aux function instead.Unbelievable that Bluetooth is not working in 2022...
1,Trash.  I knew I wasn’t dealing with a $1000 single din but didn’t even hold together for install.  Pre installed and everything was working.  Unplugged the speaker wire harness to clean up and actually install... when plugging back in the speaker harness... no sound.  Would get a connection about halfway and then lose it locked in.  Unplugged speaker harness and saw the pins in the back of the radio had been pushed into the radio.  I took the back apart and pushed pins back out to accept the harness... harness just pushed the pins back in.  Never had a problem with BOSS until now... unplugged the power harness and threw the radio across the shop.  Problem solved.
5,Liked everything about it
5,This come in very good condition love it work good but just the you have to put it close to it for it to work
4,Work and is good for the price.
4,I was expecting more
3,Overall decent product has Bluetooth Bluetooth streaming Bluetooth phone calls but sound quality is not up to par equalizer pretty low quality
5,easy to installing
3,Everytime I plug my phone thru the USB the stereo freezes and I gotta reset it but other than that the stereo works fine.
5,works like a charm. install is easy. sound is even better than my last (more expensive) receiver. i am very happy with this purchase
5,Has equalizer settings. Very easy to use. Simple instructions for wiring. Great sound via Bluetooth.  Have this in a 1966 sears silver tone radio
5,Easy to install looks great.  Only thing I dislike is no one can hear me while I bluetooth a phone call.  They all have told me I sound far away.
5,Cant beat how easy it was to install and use and sounds awesome.  Very pleased with it for the money I spent on it
5,Bought this to put in my Can Am Commander. This radio is awesome for the money. It works perfectly. You will need to buy an antenna for it if you wanna listen to radio stations. Would definitely buy again.
5,Great unit with great display plenty of easy to set and use presets and this on e comes with remote at a great price.  I'd rather have no instructions than the really bad instructions included though...
5,Loved it put in both of my old trucks
4,Bueno
4,Great functionality. I wish I could disable the graphic display.
5,Only minor issue is I’ve had people say that I sounded a little muffled while talking but other then that more the what I expected!
1,Worked great for about 3 months until it wouldn't shut off after the car was off. The LED panel would stay on and kill my battery. It overheats to the point where you could smell the plastic burning. I've resorted to just unplugging it and connecting one Bluetooth headphone.
1,Bought this for my work truck 97 Chevy Silverado.  it worked great...for about a 2 weeks. Now the display don’t work. Sometimes it doesn't display anything just blank but the other lights on the buttons do come on. I bought it because of the positive reviews but I guess I wasn’t one of the lucky ones. I really liked the stereo and the features for the prize.
3,It’s great but it’s sonetgibg about it .. lol I cut it off because I wonder about my battery dying .
5,Sound and bass is awesome quality product
5,a perfect match for my commuter car!I drive a 2005 sedan and it had a stock stereo that just was not cutting it anymore. This was a great upgrade for a really low cost.
5,I purchased this for my daughter's Honda CRV as an upgrade from the old Pioneer (cassette) unit.  Easy to install even though I had to cut and reconnect the plug.  She loves the bluetooth capability with her iPhone6.  Great unit for a small price!
2,I mostly used it for its Bluetooth and it worked fine.The radio is pretty bad but I didn't really care for it.The main issue is that just over a year after buying it (and less than a year after it's installed) it died.I know it's cheap and I shouldn't expect it to last for years but less than a year is a too short lifspan
2,Bluetooth disconnects regularly not very loud poor quality construction.
4,works good EXCEPT radio reception sucks
5,Great radio wish the screen was a little brighter has 3 settings I have it on high it could be brighter in daytime
2,The Bluetooth stopped working after a week. Everything is pretty bad. It’s cheap but seriously one week...
2,The device works great but know that in ANY vehicle you will not be able to properly mount it with the hardware supplied.
5,I've had this in my '08 Crown Victoria for a year now and it works well.  It does what it's made for and was easy to install.
5,BT to my cheap phone with no problems.  I can not remember what I have in the doors but this head unit safetied out at max volume for too long ;)  Super easy to install
4,Needs CD player
1,This item worked fine for about 10 short car trips and almost made it 90 days before it just stopped playing. Popped in the original radio and that still plays fine so it wasn't wiring power or speaker related. It seems this only has a 30 day warranty and the seller just refers you back to Amazon. Lesson learned you get what you pay for.
5,I gave 5 stars because of the price quality and functionality. not super fancy but it definitely does the job as described and was easy to install.
5,Awesome
5,Talk about best bang for the “Buck”!This little guy rocks my newly restored Dodge Neon!Did not have any money left from restoration so this fit perfectly!!!
5,Once I figured out the wiring and installed it it's a great head unit for the price sounds great and works great
1,This unit has little or no fm reception. I used several antennas. Swapped antenna from a working unit still no reception.  Sent unit back.
5,Easy to installed and great sound
5,Exalent for the money! Put this on my 2004 HD Electra glide don't care if it gets wet it cheep enough to replace if it quits working
5,For the money you can't beat it!
5,I really love the user interface on this stereo and how it really accentuates the interior of my vehicle there is no downside to buying boss
5,Basic and fucntional it fits normal sizes and is good quality
5,For the price it's a great unit. The hands free calling is exceptional. I drive a truck and am told people can hear me fine. That's surprising
2,Installed this product about 6 or 7 months ago. Driving home today the unit went blank but the radio still on. Turned off my car and the radio wouldn’t turn off even with keys out of the ignition. Face was blank. Pulled the dash apart and removed the unit. It was HOT.  Hot enough that when I grabbed it I instantly pulled away. Worked well until it didn’t I guess. Just like most things.
5,Great product for what is cost seriously there is a microphone built in and phone calls are clear. Bluetooth hooks up instantly and sounds great
4,Worth it
5,Work as expected
1,I DO NOT recommend this item! Yes the price seems WAY too good to be true and that’s because it IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE! This unit was absolute garbage.I installed triple-checked my wiring the unit powers on but there is absolutely no sound at all. I plug in my other aftermarket unit and it works fine.This is the second cheap unit I’ve purchased from Amazon this week to find out that it does not work properly.Pro tip: Spend the extra $20 or so and get a name-brand unit. These cheap units are BAD! Don’t waste your time like I did!
2,I guess for the price I shouldn’t be disappointed. It’s basic at best. The best quality is I am able to use the Bluetooth to listen to Pandora. Cons: all my settings for sound reset everyone I turn the car off when someone calls if your phone Bluetooth is I it will play through the speakers even if your listening to the FM radio. It’s okay.
5,Really nice it works perfect for our car
5,If it wasn't for a thousand wires coming from the vehicle it would be simple to install.  Sound quality is excellent.
1,The damn thing wouldn’t even power on. Complete garbage.
3,Sounds pretty lame but... it was $25.00 delivered and installed in 30 min.Could be the ancient stock speakers that are so bad?
5,muy bueno y buen presio
5,The unit performs outstanding for the price I replaced a Kenwood unit with this one and can't tell any difference in audio quality plus this one has the added convenience of an SD card slot and USB.I already bough a second unit for another car.
5,Great product and the price is the best
3,Works well for the price. No issues as of yet and sounds good with the factory speakers..
3,Randomly pauses bluetooth music or drops link. Audio quality is minimal and eq display isnt actuall. Just for looks
5,Popped this thing in to replace the radio in my old truck. Works great. Install was ez. Need wire and bracket kit.
5,Ive used boss audio for every car I've owned never had an issue just added this one to my civic and I'm in love with it beat part is the Bluetooth feature no aux cord needed
5,I installed it on my car in February and it is still working perfectly specially Bluetooth which connects to my phone every time without any problem sound is very good too
5,So far so good! It linked right up with my phone and the settings allowed me to adjust the eq perfectly. Sounds great with my factory speakers...from 1996
5,It works amazingly. Easy to install instructions were easy to follow. Very good sound easy to navigate and probably the best car stereo I've owned. Its not too flashy which I like and totally affordable!
5,Great.
5,I am no sound quality expert but it sounds pretty good to me. All I needed was something with bluetooth and that part works great.
5,I made a homemade cooler speaker and it was perfect for it
5,Needed a replacement for the factory radio in my 2005 Accord. With the correct adapter this was easy to install works great.
1,The unit did not power on disappointing.
4,Works good for the price
2,Faulty mic so can't make calls even after adding an external mic... Soo back to sony I go
1,The radio worked good until I turned up the volume then the radio got hot and started to micro stutter and lost my preset stations and the time. DON’T BUY!  Spend the money for a better one!
5,Great sound plenty of power ridiculous value... I love it.
1,This deck lasted less than a week. I connected to blue tooth once...it played fine but then the stereo would shut off. No matter what I did. Finally I went behind the sterio and unplugged the power and reset it. Next time blue tooth worked for about 5 mins then stopped. No sound. Reset again and worked for part of a day using radio then screen went nuts and started displaying anything but English. Would be great if it worked but unfortunately it's a pile of that and I wouldn't give two drops of sweat off my nuts to buy another. I guess I'll have to buy another better brand. Lesson learned.
1,Only had it for three weeks and it's already having blue tooth connectivity issues.  Don't recommend
5,It works perfectly. I am very satisfied it sounds good! I put it in the bathroom and when I bathe enjoy your favorite music. Radio reception a little weak but connect the antenna power and all radios at full power play. I recommend.
5,very simple. If you like options this isn't for you. HAS A BUILT IN MIC. I drive a 5 speed and it has already paid for itself. Would recommend and already have.
4,Good product. I recommended.
5,everything went smoothly with installation. great radio and great price. I installed myself and I am no where near a mechanic very easy to do yourself.
2,After 3 days The bluetooth connection still connects but does not let sound thru or when it does its all static muffeled
1,I Bought this for my work truck as I didn't want to spend alot of money on a company vehicle but wanted to have radio with bluetooth for hands free calling. The wiring was straight forward like every other one I've got installed. I payed for installation and from the very beginning the brand new stereo blue tooth didn’t work properly it was cutting off from time to time I couldn’t get for what it was intended for. I’ve called the technician support but that was  just waisting time and money so I don’t recommend it to buying this piece crap car stereo.
1,If I had known what I no now I would have never purchased this. I waited to long to have installed so I missed my return date. But I had three people try to install it for me and all three said they couldn’t get any sound out. Now I’m stuck with the factory radio till I invest in a good quality one. You get what you pay for.
5,It's  an ok unit but exceeds my expectations.
1,I've had it for 11 months.1st you have to push a button to get the time to display and it only displays for a few seconds. Kinda annoying.2nd AND THIS IS A BIG ISSUE. It will lock up and not completely turn off and doesn't ever finish saying "goodbye" or will not turn on. I have to reset it by pulling the fuse that gives it constant power to keep the memory. So then I have to set the clock again and save all of my preset stations again. This has happened 4 maybe 5 times in a year.I could not recommend this to a friend.
1,installed as directed  but cant get the memory to hold . I have to reprogram every time its start up and its a pain . please advise a remedy because at this point its going back in the box.Clay Willey
3,Cheap radio but I will buy a better one next time.  The radio stations are fuzzy and sometimes doesn’t come in at all.
5,Works like it should
5,Easy installation (2 girls)! You can also answer and end calls with this sound system!
5,Worked like a charm. Perfect
5,Comes with harness I didn't see that and bought one. Wiring took me about 2 hours and the product works as described. Perfect for installing Bluetooth in my 1996. Don't expect a headunit to improve audio quality with a headunit!!!!
1,This thing was okay at first but soon developed issues connecting to my phone.  Then after a few months it just died.  I tried replacing the fuse in the back but it was just dead
5,Returned because didn’t need
1,Volume controls stop working 1 week after able to return product
2,RADIO  (ONLY)  NO WIRING HARNESS N0 REMOTE. CORRECT HARNESS APPEARS NOT AVAILABLE !
5,Little on the junky side but that to be excepted for the price you pay
1,This stereo is trash. The true definition of you get what you pay for. My intention was a budget system that could provide the basics. I have to turn the volume almost all the way up before I can hear it over normal driving noise. I plan to reinstall my old deck and send this trash back.
1,This stereo is complete crap it's nothing but garbage I have always been hesitant to purchase anything by boss audio systems and this was my first purchase I thought I would try it hook everything up stereo lit up no sound connect to Bluetooth no sound radio no sound aux no sound I put stereos in countless cars and never experienced a stereo brand new out of the box to already be broke with pioneer or Kenwood don't waste your money spend the 30 extra dollars at least it's work!!!Went to Walmart bought a $70 pioneer works great 👍
5,NINGUNA QUEJA  LO RECOMIENDO BUEN AUDIO NITIDEZ EN LAS LLAMADAS. ACEPTO UNO GRATIS SI AL VENDEDOR NO LE CREA INCONVENIENTE
5,This radio works perfectly for my needs and safety by being Bluetooth capable. I am thoroughly pleased with this item. It came in on time.
1,I understand this is a low cost product but! the Clock is complete junk. You have to change the display when you want to see the time then it cycles back to tell you you are listening to "radio" or "Bluetooth". What they heck wouldn't they have the time displayed all the time? If there's a way to make it display the time constantly I cannot figure it out. Mine also losses the time about every other day. The radio itself works but come one I feel like a user friendly clock is a pretty basic expectation of a car radio.
1,Please don’t waste your money…. Can’t even turn the volume up it sounds terrible
5,Awesome!!!
5,Having a hard time with the Bluetooth on this product other than that it's a great product for the price
5,I am totally satisfied with this radio.  It works perfectly with my Echo Auto as well.  Love it!
5,Good Seller good product and questions answered promptly
3,Clock doesn’t permanently display at all times.Doesn’t hook up to dimmer.Has annoying sound bars that move with the music you can’t turn off.
1,They show pictures showing a wiring harness to connect to the back of the stereo. I received a stereo with no wiring harness at all. I had ordered a stereo (assuming it would have its own power connectors as shown in the pictures of the product) ordered an installation kit and also a wiring harness to connect between the stereo's power harness and the factory harness. It arrived in a bubble wrap bag. It did not show up in a box. OK no problem. Cannot install due to missing harness that needs to come with the stereo.Do not order. Spend a bit more money and get better quality...maybe even get it in an actual box.
1,Was working fine then all of the sudden the stereo started screeching.  It will work for a few minutes every time you get in the vehicle.  After about 3 minutes the unit begins to shreak and screech very loud in all source modes.  AM/FM bluetooth aux all screech.  The only way to stop the screeching is to turn volume down to 0 or to turn the unit off completely.  I've checked all my connections and antenna the unit itself has gone completely faulty after 1 months time.  Should have known better than to go so cheap lesson learned.
1,Granted you get what you pay for...and its cheap and a Amazon "pick".  Despite reading reviews I bought it.  Install went fine. Problem with it is I can NOT see the display. Yes there are 3 levels of display none of which can be seen in daylight.  The only function I have been able to actually use is the AUX with  my mp3 player.  The clock not showing is a huge drawback. Want to return but at this price point just taking it out of vehicle ordering a different one etc...its just frustrating to have to settle on junk.
5,Buena calidad  excelente para mí cargo van
5,Worked and connects to bluetooth fast. The quality feels light and cheap but for 30 dollars its been working good.
5,Perfect replacement
1,Less than 2 weeks after being installed driving down the interstate we started smelling something burning that smelled electrical. Sure enough we noticed smoke coming from the stereo. Fortunately my husband ripped it out of my truck's dash board before any major damage had taken place. We checked the wiring in the dash and it was fine but the inside of the stereo itself was burnt. I am extremely thankful for my spouse's quick thinking because this could have ended an absolutely devastating way. Regardless of the number of positive reviews we read before purchasing this stereo... never again will we make this mistake. Pay the money for a quality stereo.
3,Outside of the microphone for bluetooth sucking. This is a great stereo for the money.
5,Works good
5,Looks  good I wonder how distracting the white power bars dancing at night will be do not know yet. Good buy overall.
2,The radio (FM/AM) mode gets freaky with the volume. It is at full volume no matter where you turn the volume setting. And you hear a lot of pops. The bluetooth is good and works good. The volume works like it should in that mode. I dont listen to the radio a lot but once in a while I do so this is very disappointing.
5,Was worried due to the low price. Installed and works perfectly. Not sure how long it will last but so far I’m impressed.
5,I have not had it long enough to rate it working quality.  It does appear to be made well and I am happy.
4,great for the price
5,For about $25 dollars you can't go wrong. Sounds good Bluetooth works well only complaint is with instructions I they are going to number items please number them on the pages also.
3,First one came broken sent back next one came working not bad for the price
5,Great stereo for the money! Put it in my boat. May not be marine but for the price can’t go wrong.
5,Highly recommended specially for the price
5,Fits perfectly in a 91 Jeep YJ!!!
5,Bluetooth has weird connection issues. Sometimes when playing a song the audio level will lower and rise at random.
5,This product is great. Purchase it. It's amazing. Has fast pairing and resume the music where you left it.
2,I found out that you can buy a jacket or kenwood for 100 at Best Buy and get install for free.  65 is normal install rate.  Tech said these radios sometimes work for only a month.  So I went with a kenwood which was a few bucks more but much better quality.
2,No memory connection
5,Easy install with the right adapters and accessories. Make sure to do your research on your car stereo and what you need.
1,I first was satisfied with the sound and the usability of my new radio. Then eight months later it locks making a high pitch sound.  It is a loud squealing sound that does not turn off for anything.  I hold down buttons I turn the car off and remove the key but nothing.  I have to go home and disconnect the battery to get it to stop.  It is a hell of a trip home with that horrible noise. This has happened twice all ready.  I had a Boss before this one which had a weird problem ass well so no more Boss.
5,I had bought it for my sons truck. He installed it in no time.
5,My teenager loves this model. It connects easily to her phone so she doesn’t have mess with the radio while driving.
2,Sound is sort of mediocre bluetooth connectivity is awesome. Cant go wrong for the price.
5,Great product
1,Like many others I agree that the audio quality is pretty good. Everything else though very cheaply put together and you see it shows with these reviews.After 3 days of using this the Bluetooth's audio went from grade A to grade F. It was distorted and 'ting-y'. Happened all within a second it seems. All other systems worked OK but the Bluetooth was FUBAR.The display was *working* but if you're driving in a car that has not-so-tinted windows you can barely notice that the screen is even on during the daytime.
5,This is the best radio for the price hands down. Easy install with an install kit.
5,Put into a 1988 GMC Sierra with a convention and worked right away no problem! Also the wires were properly colored and was good quality!
2,Good value but the remote is worthless. It has to be within about 2 inches to work. The remote was why I bought this so I'm disappointed.
1,Will not hook up to a phones Bluetooth
5,My husband bought this for his 1999 Honda Accord when the radio completely went out. He installed it himself and it works just great
5,Amazing sound made my car really enjoyable. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Easy to install too.
5,Easy to use came with everything I need for my car that had an old aftermarket radio. Great price.
5,I love my new car radio and I installed it myself with little knowledge of car mechanics. Watch a instructional video that matches with your car and you'll be fine!
2,Not very good sound or quality
5,This radio is exactly what I wanted. Bluetooth connection with built-in microphone that made my life easier. It's also easy to use.
5,Alot of bang for your bucks. Hard to beat 30 bucks for a system that has basic bluetooth and a 50w preamp with sub output.
1,I get it’s cheap but it’s worth way less than we paid for it! If I could return it I would!! Knob falls off buttons don’t work it takes forever to switch from radio to bluetooth or aux. absolutely worthless!!
5,I was a little hesitant on buying this product because of the price. But when i received and installed it worked from the get go. Would buy again for sure
5,Radio was an easy install sound quality not as good as previous radio however considering it is a short chassis it will serve the purpose.
2,Lasted less than 2 months before no longer working...
1,a first i hated this unit. so dim you couldnt see it. also crappy sound. i looked at feedback lots of people said the display is too dim lots said too bright all said non adjustable.  it is adjustable low med hi.  its not super bright on hi but good enough. also i played with the EQ and it helped. not fantastic but maybe its stock car speakers. not sure so i wont say for sure its the radio. now its day two  and the display is set at  hi and now barely viable. this piece of junk is going back.
1,First unit I received didn’t work and Amazon sent me a new one.  I was actually impressed at first because it was working pretty good.  After 3 1/2 months it just quit working.  I checked the wiring fuses power and nothing.  Just had to replace it.
5,Surprised me how it sounds compared to my stock stereo. Everything works great including Bluetooth. I put it in my old FL70 and would recommend it.
1,Bought it because of the Bluetooth featurea and that is the only thing that doesn’t work not able to conect to my iphone. Not happy. I guess thats why the price is so low
4,Radio works perfect but microphone dos not has good quality. People cannot hear me clear. Other than that works perfect.
5,SImple to install and to configure. Bluetooth connects automatically once configured and the wuality is good. Recommended for all types of cars.
1,1) No function to move next or previous folder (in USB)2) When you turn your engine off this 616UAB  forgets where (on which song and folder) it was so next time it starts from the very beginning3) Same for volume and source when you turn car engine off it forgets completely everything4) Usually when you press Volume (big round) button it pause the music. This 616UAB starts the menu settings.Overall: don't even think of buying it. I threw my one into the garbage and looking for another one
5,Love this receiver it is perfect for my pick upgreat sound easy to install and works perfectly!
5,For the price you will not find a better product. A little underpowered. Has trouble pushing 4 six inch speakers but the Bluetooth works great. No complaints.
1,Installation went fine the radio sounded fine.  Then one day black "magic" smoke started to come out of the radio.  Pulled the car over and pulled the radio out to find that it overheated.I haven't opened the radio up yet to see what component actually fried.  But I suspect that the radio needed a larger heat sink than what is (or maybe not) installed.And of course it didn't die until AFTER the return period.I will be replacing the radio but it will NOT be a radio from Boss Audio Systems.
5,Inexpensive and works well for the money just buy it it has decent sound and is easy to install (like most)
5,Works great easy to install
4,Works great
5,Easy to install Bluetooth for music and hands free phone work great get better fm signal than my stock radio
1,Bluetooth stopped working after a week. Now I have to get it  uninstalled UPDATE AFTER reset its all good.
5,Hands free phone. Interrupts the radio play during a call but returns to the music after the call. Built in microphone means my phone says in my purse.
3,Worked well for about a week but has lost the visual display ever since. will not buy again.
5,We bought this for our camp trailer and all I can say is it works perfectly in every aspect with great sound at an exceptional price.
1,It looks good the install was easy but it sounded terrible!! The mini cable in from my phone didn't work properly I never got a chance to try the USB input The unit died a few days after I installed it. The lights on the front are on but no response no sound no response to the remote. I disconnected the battery reconnected the battery it came back on properly for about a minute then POOF! gone again....I have NEVER had any luck with Boss stuff and I will NEVER buy anything from them again.
3,I did not get a remote with my radio otherwise it is great
3,I love it just also wish it had a CD player but hey I love it
4,Good stereo for the price.
2,The stereo broke within one week due to the common LCD problem. Additionally the amplifier is weak and radio reception is very poor.Returned this and spent $20 more for a Pioneer. Much better sound and the radio picks up more stations as well. Compared to this stereo the Pioneer is a bargain despite the $20 higher price tag.
5,Overall good product for price only thing a miss is that i can't use radio but i have spotify
5,This unit is much more than I expected for the price. I've never had a radio that connects and disconnects from my phone so quick!
1,4 months in review: About a month or 2 ago the stereo would cut out ever once in a while. To resolve this problem I would push in on the front plate and the audio would come back. This was intermittent and random. A few days ago I no longer get any audio and the unit seems officially dead.Original Review:Easy to install the unit is pretty hollow so you can mount screws almost anywhere. Easy phone bluetooth setup my Samsung phone resumes playing when I get back in my car. Screen is also easy to read.
1,It was a piece of garbage didn't work sent back for a refund in November throw ups still have not received any correspondence from Amazon or the seller.
5,This unit has been working great all the features great..  It's amazing to me how an inexpensive unit like this can work at all.
5,Was easy to install. The aux and usb make it worth the money if you mostly just listen to music off your phone.
1,Worked fine for about 28 days then had all kinds of things go wrong. First the audio settings would start randomly resetting themselves then the display would go bonkers and now when the radio is on it gets this crazy build up of static noise that ends in a huge POP in the right channel. Turning the car off MAY resolve any of those issues at any given time but it's random. Of course my return option ran out right when it started so I ended up having to buy something different. What a pile of doo doo.
1,Turns on... but doesn't work
5,Easy to install. Very light. Sound is pretty good. Not as good as others but for the price its great.
5,This is a Great radio for the price installation was straight forward worked excellent in my cheap beater car. The best part of this radio is the USB will charge a phone or iPod
3,awesome radio super easy to install.  cheap plastic trim though.... it broke before it was installed.
5,Great for the price! My husband installed it into his Semi truck
3,I like that it automatically connects to my phone when it is turned on.
1,So I bought 3 of these... the first one bought for my kids car works great no issues connects to my phone instantly and starts the music. Perfect right? I buy one for my car no sound return and get another and the same thing happened.. 1 out of 3 working isn't good odds.
5,Bought it for my brothers rv sound is good and he enjoys the Bluetooth capability for his music when he’s outside
2,Made in china
5,fit perfect with no adapter needed easy to use and sounds great
5,Like it
5,Great sound and interface for the price slightly difficult to mount but good with some rigging.
5,This is a really good car stereo everything works and for the price cant beat this
5,works good as a replacement for my old receiver i use the SD card option regularly. Item as described.
5,does exactly what I expected from this price range! turns on every time and connects to Bluetooth as it should. it has minimal power but I didn't need much!
5,The device works beautifully. Really great value
3,For the price it was a good purchase
5,This is a steal for 40 bucks. Bluetooth aux radio sdcard and usb all work out of the box for me. If you're looking for a cheap replacement just for entertainment and aren't a snooty audiophile this is for you.
2,Installed in my 92 Chevrolet S10 worked great for about 3 weeks and than just took a dump hasn’t started since and I’ve checked everything the led background light turns on but the stereo is just toast. It was for normal use nothing competition wise or high power I guess since it was so cheap that’s what you get.
5,Great product. The bluetooth hooks up minute I turn on n starts playing. Best 20 I have ever spent.
5,Impressed with this stereo  only wanted a a cheapy for old Jeep  and this stereo is awesome for the price . BOSS is Boss
1,Dose not sound good or pick up stations good at all
5,It a very good car stereo for $30. I like it a lot and it's a lightweight stereo not heavy as the other and does the job.
5,Delivered fast and a great price. Won't install for a couple of months but excited to receive.
5,along with the boss speakers work great
5,It was easy to install I've been using it for months the blutooth is great. It's definitely a great deal!
2,Worked well for a couple months Bluetooth calls were the first thing that started falling people would not hear me the Bluetooth was not reliable and I would constantly have to finish calls on speaker phone.  After a few more months it would turn on but no sound.....
5,Great stereo for the price.  A huge improvement over the stock stereo in my 2006 Kia spectra. Bluetooth works great no lag when watching videos.
5,Definitely would recommend it! Installed in my son's 2001 vw beetle. Sounds good and looks good. No complaints.
5,Need more power
3,Works great but the controller only works once in a while and the radio resets itself.
5,Works great for the price make sure your vehicle is single din or has a slimmer radio (about 2 inches tall) otherwise this will not fit
5,Can’t beat it for the price. I installed in my boat and it works great!
1,If I could give this less than 1 star I would. I bought this for my sister for her 2005 Jeep Liberty. It fits but the radio is junk. It worked for a day or two then it quit so our dad had to take it back out and see what was wrong. It has done nothing but quit or make loud strange humming noises. Then when she turned off her Jeep the noise continued. So my dad had to completely take it out of the dash so it wouldn’t kill the battery. So save your money! We are just going to buy her a Pioneer radio system.
5,Every function woeks great. AM radio is needed for me and begining to be rare or bad sound quality on other models.
1,I sent the first one back it was junk boss audio 616uab bluetooth  so  i figured i just got a bad one so i ordered another one after i sent the 1st one back when i got the 2nd one it was doing the same thing as the first one junk 2nd one(NOT WORKING). hooked old radio back up and it worked also hooked up my friends alpine with Bluetooth and that worked he was selling alpine so i bought that.. the moral of the story don't be cheap junk and don't buy any Boss product from any were as the old saying you get what you pay for
5,Excellent Price Super Easy to install I just have to wait how long the radio lasts
5,For  the price it is perfect
5,Manual could be more explicit for installation.  Lightweight material may not be very durable.  Right for the price. Sound good.
5,Easy to install. Connects to any device seamlessly with minimal effort. Would recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade to the next gen bluetooth radios it sounds amazing for the price too!
5,For what it's worth you can't beat the price. Of course it's not the loudest nor the best looking. Overall it's okay
5,Mui. Cien
5,Gotta say I bought a cheap 20 dollar radio like this one and it was awful. For an extra 10 bucks this radio is well worth it.
5,Considering price and  quality it has worked and sounds great since September 2017 !!  I'm buying morw for my other farm trucks and tractors
1,I ordered this product in May of this year while waiting to receive this decc a friend gave me one he had laying around. This decc has been sitting around for the past 4 months I installed it in September it is now November 30 and this decc has been giving me problems the past 4 weeks. It shuts off randomly there is no display or it looks like the screen is having a short most of the time. For something that has been getting used for 2 months it is a horrible product
1,Great stereo for a few months then the Bluetooth connectivity stopped working. I've followed all the troubleshooting (disconnected from battery checked connections in back tried multiple devices) and nothing has worked. I can still get music through the aux out cable but it's a pain. I think I got a lemon. Great stereo with Bluetooth for the price------when it's working.
5,Is a real good unit for the price I like it.
2,Worked great for about a month. After that my left channel packed its bags and flew the coup. Still have my right side for now but it sounds like garbage. Get what you pay for.
5,I am satified with this audio player I just upgraded my sound system in my Nissan sentra 2001. And now I am enjoying a digital sound and the product arrived as expected and in good condition.
5,Sounds great easy to install and fit in my truck perfectly
1,Went through all the hassle of installing this radio worked great for about 5 minutes then the screen begin fading out. After about 10 minutes it went dark. I reset it according to the directions but nothing. The radio did work very well but no display. I ordered another model wish me luck.
5,Wow! I'm really impressed with this Bluetooth radio. It sounds great. And you can't beat the price. Thank you
2,Cheap crap
5,Works great I don't use cds any more they get scratched up and this way it's easier and I can listen to all my songs from my fone
5,Easy to install Bluetooth works great clean instructions.  User friendly.  No issues.
5,Just what I was looking for and more power than I expected
5,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It was so simple to install. And it sounds great Thanks
5,Surprisingly good. Easy installation nice bluetooth receiver. Recommended.Update: purchased another for boat. Installed easily works great. Bluetooth makes it a treat when on the water.
5,This unit is awesome for the price mostly got it for the bluetooth and it plays music great. I haven’t used the the phone calling feature yet though.
1,The controls  are pretty good but about 1 in 5 times that I start the car the radio loses the time and preset stations.  I've seen other reviews with the same problem so I am returning it and going with a different brand.  Too bad since the the output sound was so much better than my stock radio from a 2001 Jeep.  I love Amazon.... I was pass my return window and after a online chat they allowed me to return it.
5,Very simple to install
1,I wouldn’t recommend this radio I bought it in March and by the beginning of may it just quit working. I contacted amazon they told me the refund window was closed to contact the seller they told me to contact amazon again. Then I was told to contact amazons warranty department  no luck their either and I actually just wanted a replacement. I’m aware that this is a very low cost radio but certainly it should work longer then it did and I certainly should have gotten a replacement. So do your self a favor and pass this up.
5,Facil instalación. Tengo varios meses con el radio instalado en mi vehiculo y nunca ha dado problemas.
5,Love this stereo! Had it for two months now and everything is working fine. Good sound easy to use and looks great!
2,Display is dim on 1 side and radio reception not very good. You get what you pay for.
1,I wanted so much to like this radio with the options and the price but sadly when you buy a $30.00 radio you get a $30.00 radio. The first one lasted about 9 months the second one was bad out of the box and the replacement for that has gone bad in about 2 months. They seem to get too hot and maybe that burns stuff out. Anyway now I will have to spend more money and hopefully get a better radio.
2,It puts out good sound really enjoyed listening to it but I went on a trip and It stopped working on the way I would give it a 5 star if it would have worked longer than that because my radio is one of my favorite part of my car would like to give it another try would like to see what the what you will do so I can get another replacement radio thanks
3,Get what you pay for. Cuts out and needs to be reset often.
1,What a piece of garbage. Here are the issues:1. FM signal reception is weak2. Display is so dim you cannot see it during the day3. Equalizer function intermittent4. Sound quality is terrible5. Does not keep accurate timeDon't waste your $$$ folks. Spend a few dollars more and get a name brand stereo. I would give it -10 stars if I could.
1,This was my most regretful purchase. This radio sounded great when I installed it. I like my music loud. I was satisfied for the first two weeks. Then it started behaving like it had a shortage. It was on but no sound. So I thought it was my car speakers. So my guy connected a different radio and it worked fine. Then on the third week it went out again and never played again. I lost remote so I can't return it. It's still in my car on but still not working.
3,Seems  ok
5,Great price excellent sound quality bluetooth connectivity and easy install in my '99 Crown Vic!
1,I bought this on July and the sound was great and once I paired it with my phone I didn't need to open my music app the car stereo open it every time I turn on the car so I loved that; but sadly it was short lived. Now is just a digital clock it pairs with my phone and it plays my music but there is no sound at all. I saw someone have a similar problem except he has no clock showing well he had more luck than me 😥
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Volume button stop working after a few days  and display light won't dim
5,Sound quality is good.  Great head unit if you're looking for bluetooth audio at a good price.
5,Connects easily easy to adjust and looks And sounds great!
5,Works fine except the remote quit working after a couple days. I'm not worried about it though the device itself is fine.
1,I’m updating my initial review...this unit is garbage! DO NOT BUY IT! I installed the unit and had issues the very next morning. The unit has to be reset every morning in order for me to use it. Now because I waited till I actually had time to install it I can’t get it replaced. This will be the last time I buy any electronics made by Boss. I was one week over my return date and I’m left with a piece of junk! DO NOT BUY IT!
1,This stereo worked for about one complete song then just stopped working. The lights are on I can switch it from am/fm/aux/ Bluetooth and still nothing happens no noise at all. Triple checked all my connections. It's just a pile of crap not to mention it took about a month to get here. I'm so happy I upgraded my WORKING stereo to this garbage! Yes I tried to reset it also.
5,Sounds great good bass easy to connect to bluetooth super easy hands free calls.  Worth every penny and sounds like a much higher price unit.
5,Just combine it with the right amplifier/speakers if you want more Sound! works perfect
5,Replaced radio on my 1999 Yukon. It came with a harness. The Bluetooth is the best. It automatically connect to my iPhone.
1,Picks up interference from other vehicle electronic components. There's a distinct whining noise that follows the shifting of the vehicle. I even took the deck back out and shielded it but the engine whine was still there. My previous deck did not have this issue. When playing from SD cards there's no sound during the first 3 seconds of song playback which means you always miss the first few seconds of every song. My advice is to invest in a better brand unless you want to deal with a poor quality deck for a minimum price.
5,great for price. wire harness comes with it. only thing is that I wish the eq had more variance.
5,I put it in my dump truck that I drive every day. The owner of the company liked it to
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've been using it for a couple of days and I've tried different devices and after a couples of minutes of using it the sound starts to fail and the music stops and starts stops and stars. It sounds awful while doing that I have to turn the Car Stereo OFF and turn it ON again to stop this problem and after 10 or 20 minutes Its starts again...it is getting worst... im uploading a video to show you the problem im talking about.
5,I put into my travel trailer and it is working great !
5,Really a great product for the price- and may I add It looks awesome!!!!
5,This radio is awesome. The blue display ready makes he screen pop.This radio could easily be priced a lot more than it is.
5,This worked so well for my camper i bought a second one for my shop.
1,Purchased this a little over a month ago. The blue tooth function is the primary reason I purchased. Today I tried to pair with my IPhone. It would not pair. Tried on my IPad and girlfriends iPhone 7 nothing. Of course I can’t return it because it’s over a month. I will try BOSS but other reviewers don’t give me much hope. Great price bad equipment.As an update have not been able to contact Boss. I have tried repeatedly to get a replacement seems Boss relies on volume and not customer service. If only I could take back the one star.
3,I just didn’t like that the screen stayed on
3,bluetooth / phone sounds good but sound quality of broadcast stations is poor
5,Good upgrade for the cost. Simple and easy to install. Nothing fancy and went in my daily driver!
5,This radio is an absolute steal for the price. It does have a few defects but I can definitely work with them.
1,I had a nice stereo before this that had some plastic break off it - so I replaced it with this cheap model thinking "All I need is Bluetooth - what's the difference?"There's a big difference. Bluetooth is unreliable often resets itself and will refuse to pair with my phone. I have a ton of Bluetooth devices and this is the only one that gives me issues. I often have to do a full reset of the unit. Sometime this doesn't work so I have to completely turn my car off because it will "reset" and allow pairing again.You get what you pay for.
5,Sweet little radio for cheap. Bluetooth is the option I bought it for. Great sound easy to setup...
1,This was terrible! First of all the numbers on the buttons which should have read "123456" actually read "1 upside down 5 3 upside down 3 upside down 1 5". There was no wiring harness there was half of an installation kit (which we did not order) and an instruction manual for that kit. Plus 3 or 4 little bags that had been opened and were empty who knows what was suppose to be in them. I will NEVER order from this company again. I am so disappointed and disgusted with the product I received.
1,I installed this head unit and sound was only coming out of 1/4 speakers in my car. I re-checked the wiring and everything was correct so I went to a local audio store. By the time I got there no sound was coming out at all. The professionals at the store explained how the defect rate on BOSS systems is incredibly high and after doing some tests they determined the unit was faulty from the start. My advice is DO NOT BUY THE CHEAPEST HEAD UNIT TO SAVE MONEY. Spend the extra $40 or so to get a better one. Lesson learned. I will be requesting a refund.
5,fasil de instalar y de utilizar coneccion sin problemas y con el control remoto mucho mejor
1,bought this for a friend of mine and installed it for him it worked fine for a month or so and then no longer would show up for any smart phones etc to connect to it.
1,I have had this radio for a little over a year. Figures the warranty is up after my year and what happens? A fire in my car!!!! Thank god I know what that smells like being a firefighter so I caught it early. The radio is crap and was bad! It got really hot and started smoking and almost caught on fire if not for my quick thinking of yanking it out along with all the plastics! Don’t buy this radio unless u want a car fire! I got a faulty or just crappy butt radio.
3,Ok sometimes freezes up sometimes overheats and turns off.
5,My husband ordered this and loves it. It was easy to install and use and the quality of great.
1,Recieved this and hooked it up with a plug made for my car so no bs cob job wiring just fyi so...i have hooked it up and as i was going to program my radio channels the sound quite.. took the car to the car audio place up the road and they confirmed that the unit itself had a short in the plug on the inside of the unit itself.  Recieved a refund from amazon.  No word from the manufacturer after repeated attempts to contact
5,work excellent!
4,Works great. Low cost answer to car audio
5,Fits perfectly in a 2010 Toyota Yaris 10/10Everything works as expected and it's a great value for the price I paid!
1,Worked for about a day and then The screen goes black. Tried to contact the company who sells the product and no help. They are trying to tell me how to install it but I’m a master mechanic and know the ins and outs of electrical automotive work. Just trust me it’s not work the headache because now I have to just contact amazon. Don’t waste your money or time. Glad I didn’t have pay for an install on top of it.
2,Audio keeps dropping when it gets warm after a hour of it so of music it starts cutting in and out. Swapped to a old radio and it dose not show the same issue. Definitely something wrong with the radio. Pay extra and get something better
5,You get what you pay for! Its an awesome little device for the price.
5,Great if you are looking for a relatively simple am/fm/usb/Bluetooth radio for your vehicle. Fit nicely in my ‘08 Crown vic.
5,Worked perfect for my application had to gard wire due to idiot who owned the truck prior to myself but stereo fit perfect
2,No subwoofer preout
5,For the $$$$ this is not a bad sounding Unit... Nice find happy with it...
5,Pretty good. It isn't that much money you get what you pay for.
1,Had to recant my good review two week in sound stopped playing display worked. I reset it started working again. Long drive a week later almost home sound stopped playing tried resetting again but it was dead too late to return. Started reading reviews and saw I wasn't the only one this happened too. Save your money go buy a cheap pioneer or Sony from Walmart for $60-$80 that's what I did works great. Hope this saves someone else $20.
5,Bought this to replace a tape deck in an Airstream. Works well and was easy to install using the color coded harness.
5,Great!  kinda hard to see the face from inside the golf cart
2,Blow out fuses over heater
1,Don't buy this product. After a month of use it started smoking while listening to the radio. Luckily I wasn't driving yet and after turning off the car it stopped smoking. I took it out and no char marks on any of the wires. The smoke was coming from inside the unit. If there was a problem why didn't the fuse blow!? (I'm using stock speakers with no other amps) Lesson learned you get what you pay for.
5,Está muy chévere
5,Great sound for the money.  Put it in my 1998 Jeep .
2,You cannot play music from an iPhone or Android phone via USB. It will only charge your phone. This limitation should be made clear n the description.
1,This thing sucks it said room for 1 amp no it will only allow you to plug in your door front and rear speakers I tore all of my plugs off the wires that went to my previous radio and found out you need to have those plugs so now I can not have any radio until I figure out how to fix it
5,This was a gift and the person says it is great. He installed and linked his phone and he loves it and recommends it to everyone.
1,When the radio came it was missing a piece to mount it but I ignored that because I had a spare. After having this installed for several months it has killed my battery on a nearly weekly basis. The LED screen doesn't always shut off when you turn the car or unit off. It is installed correctly (had to pay a pro to check it because of the terrible unless directions). Save yourself the headache and money for something better.
1,I only bought this because I made a novice mistake and shorted out my Pioneer HU and needed some tunes in the car; the price was nice BUT I wouldn't recommend it! In the short time that I've owned it: the bluetooth doesn't connect and it resets itself back to zero settings every couple of days or so! Learn from my mistake and INVEST in a decent system! It only gets one star because I couldn't rate it lower!
2,there was no wireless remote in my package when i received it and the primary knob on the unit itself was cracked on the inside. im left with turning the volume up and down with the metal stick under the plastic knob. really  disappointed with how this came out i had thought Boss made better quality products than this
5,Simple base level aftermarket. Exactly what I wanted.
1,Volume doesn’t work
2,Can barely even see the screen. There is no brightness setting. Everything else works great.
1,Updated:Garbage. Routinely freezes and remains powered on in frozen state after key removed. Worked fine for a while but after prolonged play it has problems. About 30-45 mins into drive is when issue arises. Requires removal of wiring harness to reset. Night time blue light is too bright too.Intiial:For the price this is great! Bt works great. Call is adequate. SD card is my favorite. Fully feel like I got my money worth. Wish I could turn down blue light on dash to half but haven't seen a way to do that.
5,I love the controls the look of it and the sounds couldn't be happier!!
1,It keeps turning off by it self.
5,good buy
1,This stereo has been a pain. It's been fine when it worked but has several problems. The blue tooth is unreliable a lot of the time it wouldn't connect to my phone. You can't use it with the engine off or it'll drain your battery. 2 times I entered my car to find my car dead with the stereos lights on. like seriously it can't even turn off fully.
5,Good product for the money. Good sound for the average user
3,No se pudo instalar como llegó hubo que remplazarle los terminales interiores.
5,Very good sound. For the priceNo cd slots but who uses that anyway.
5,Great deal very pleased. Sounds Awesome easy to install looks good good price fast shipping Post office. Well done!
1,I really wanted to like this. The readio works well but the bluetooth is extremely choppy. I was gone on a work trip immediately after installing it and thus missed the return window. I wish i would have driven more so I would have found out sooner about the poor bluetooth quality. Charger works but it won't recognize that the USB is connected to my phone. Had this option worked I wouldn't be writing this but 2 faulty features is just terrible.
5,Amazing deal
2,Started to freeze and stay on after a month...have to pull fuse or disconnect power connector to unfreeze radio. had to install a manual kill switch for my daughters car so that she can reset it herself..she likes the radio...really?
3,I love the radio but unfortunately it got fried within a month of use
1,I suppose you get what you pay for... bought the radio just for a camper road trip to have bluetooth. Wanted everyone to be able to play tunes.Bluetooth worked flawlessly for 1 week. Then kaput... had to buy am aux cord to play our own music.Now need to install another radio. Waste of time and money.
1,After making the connections the unit would not power on.  I tested all power wires and made sure I had power.  Tried all the connections is different configurations in case I had something wired  wrong but nothing. I guess these are not tested at the factory but for this price I guess you shouldn't expect that.  I returned it with no problems though.
2,I am fairly pleased overall with the radio. It seemed to be a good value.One year and one month after installing it the screen display stopped working. Iay choose to spend a bit more on my next system.
1,So here's a funny thing: Unit decided to stay powered on all the time and ultimately killed my battery while in quarantine. Couldn't get the stupid thing to power on again after getting a jump.Prior to that BT was spotty (constant connection issues). Just spend a bit more cash for a better unit.
2,I gave this two stars because it worked well for as long as it worked. But only had it installed for a year and it just died about exactly at 12 months. Checked the fuses which were fine so it was definitely a stereo failure.
2,Radio didnt last 2 weeks quit working. Speakers popped as soo as I installed it. Then they quit playing all together. Bought higher end sony unit and it works perfectly. Dont waste your money
5,Great
1,I had the radio in the box for 8 months. Finally got it professionally installed and it froze immediately. I had to take the dash apart to remove the power plug because it wouldn't turn off when I shut the car off removed the key and even locked it and waited. I tried using it again hours later and not only did it freeze it gave I high pitched sound off that wouldn't stop when I turned the vehicle off or etc....
1,Installed all went well enough. The day 3 will not play mp3s from usb. Shows playing but no sound everything else seems ok. All i wanted was to play mp3s and it will not do it. Time to change brands. I guess i get crap for under 100$ now days.
5,Muy bueno
3,Was dumb luck I guess
3,Didn’t come with remote control. Other than that very pleased with my purchase.
3,The USB port don't work!It plays great.
3,I need the right wiring harness and then I'll really like it
1,Installed unit in 2004 Honda (March 2019) worked fine for about 3 months and then it just stopped working all together. I took part my dash and checked fuse in the car and also in the back of the radio and they were good. It just powered off with the light on and never came back on. Guess I get what I pay for Not a good Product.
5,For being as cheap as it is  it is a nice radio
1,Everything about this inexpensive radio is great...except!  Everything works fine except the AM tuner.  FM Bluetooth MP3 SD media remote etc. all fine.  AM tuner fades and changes tone and volume randomly.  It lasted about a month and then started acting weird.  News radio is annoyingly difficult to hear.  I've always like Boss Audio and have purchased speakers and components before.  They have always been fine.  Can't recommend this radio and I'm not sure I will take a chance again on Boss Audio components.
5,Great for a starter or simple replacement radio.
5,The radio world's really well and is very simple to use once installed. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.
1,There are supposed to be two separate connectors: one has power wires ground and antenna. The other has the speaker wires.I opened my box and I have 2 power/ground connectors and no speaker connectors. Its unusable and this has been a huge waste of my time as I've already got the speakers fitted and the old radio out.Poor QC
5,This was easy to install in my Toyota Rav4 (2002) with a wire harness adapter Sounds great and I love the bluetooth.
3,Worked great for 2 months then stopped
2,I've had item for a couple months in the box. Installed it a couple weeks ago worked great to start. Linked with my phone almost immediately through Bluetooth but after a couple weeks of having it Bluetooth doesn't pop up anymore.
1,I am sorry to give such a bad review of this head unit but I have no choice. I am all about saving money but within reasons. The sound quality does not exist bluetooth connectivity was easy but the sound transfer is horrid. I was so very disappointed with the quality.  Not sure how it is an Amazon Choice item. Needless to say its going back.
5,Great product for the price  easy to install and use
3,😶
5,Good
1,I disliked this radio! After 10 hours of installing this radio it kept shorting out internally! This thing is garbage and BOSS should feel bad about selling products like this! This thing is a POS! Stick to going to Walmart or Best Buy and getting your monies worth! Hope no one else purchased this and wasted their money! Signed Big Poppa Pump!
1,well easy to hook up worked just fine for 25 minutes then no sound double ck everything even reset like it said to do  you can't expect much for 30 bucks i mean really why even sell something this cheaply made thank God amazon going to give refund i mean what was i thinking.all turned out good tho.
3,Needs ability to show me song titles and artist from spotify.
1,This stopped working 2 months after install. Sad thing is it's warrantied for a year but you have to pay $20 plus your shipping to get it warrantied ... it only costs $30 new. Yeah ... save your money and buy something better than this piece of Junk. I mean I new I was buying something cheap but not this bad ... Total waste of money.
1,I have had this unit installed since February. I have constantly had to remove it from the dash and unplug the power cable to get the thing to power up. It seems like whenever the thing loses power from the engine starting or turning it off getting it to come back on can be a problem. I am now with a blank unit that will not turn on and will not do anything.
1,Have had it for less than a year. Just recently added speakers was jamming out thing just of over heated. Lights up fine plays subs but won’t  play any speaker outputs.
3,Unit will turn back on  it doesn't work half the time I
1,I have had this stereo for a couple months now and it is already messing up.. The stereo will no longer keep my preset Bass Treble loud settings. The stereo will not play SD cards and every time I plug the antenna into the stereo there is always a noise coming from the speakers even with a antenna ground adapter plugged in. This is a cheap unit and I guess you get what you pay for a POS....
1,The radio is absolutely horrible sounding. Wish return window had not passed. Weak bass lousy mid range and treble overload. Even the blutooth is awful. I had put this in a my daughters car thinking it was a bargain. This is not a bargain at anything over $10 because that's all its worth. Replaced it with a   Pioneer MVH-X390BT Vehicle Digital Media Receiver with Pioneer ARC app compatibilityBuilt-in Bluetooth and USB Direct Control for iPod/iPhone and Certain Android Phones Black         . Spend a few more bucks. You wouldn't believe the difference.
4,Works great.
5,Works great for the price  Bluetooth calls are loud and clear 👌
5,It's a great stereo sounds good Bluetooth works great
5,I put it on my 1100cc bike and is holding up good for now ..
5,Does exactly as I hoped and can't beat the price.
1,Worked for about a month then my passenger side started to go out then it completely went out. It started to short out and had to tap on it to get it to work then it completely died. I first thought it was my wiring but I ran some tests and it’s definitely the radio. Just throw in some extra money and get a radio that’ll work.
5,A ok. Click feature is not accessible or handy.
1,I wish I could give less than 1 star. The worst electric product possibly ever made. Don't waste any more time reading reviews. Just move on. I know you were like me wondering which of these super affordable low end radios would do.. This isn't the one. The audio quality was poor at best right out of the box and 2 months in the unit is completely dead. So disappointed I let myself buy trash.
1,I received it in good shape.but irs been like a week that i had it installed and it just loses sound.On the display it shows bluetooth connected and the sound waves display on screen but nonsound.Am fm aux bluetooth nothing. Ill probably return it. This is like the 5th item from amazon that i jave to return.Is there such a thing as quality anymore?
5,best little radio's i have used in years
5,Easy to install. Sounds great! Easy to connect to Bluetooth
2,Every time I turn my truck back on I have to go back and change all the sound settings again. And the screen stopped working after a week so I have to hope I change the right settings.
5,Me encanto mi nuevo radio para mi carro además de que llego super rápido.
1,Purchased this radio in February and in April it shut off and wouldn't work anymore.  After changing the fuse it still wouldn't start.  Hopefully they warranty can replace me a new one to try.
5,Leave it on Bluetooth and automatically connects to your phone whenever you get in your car this is awesome!
5,I am amazed at the sound quality of this $29 stereo!
1,Finally got to hook up in my truck. All the controls work no power to the speakers wired up way supposed to be won’t play any music
1,Only has 2 out puts and not much power then it resets its self every day are very other day. Wouldn't recommend this product. I wish I could get my money back.
5,Like the price for the price you get what you pay for not bad
1,Bought this because it had decent enough reviews had Bluetooth and was CHEAP. The first one failed a few months after purchase. But I'm and over-trusting moron and thought "it's so cheap I'll buy another one... they can't both fail." Well I can't tell you how wrong I was. The second one failed two weeks after arrival.  Don't waste your time or money on this POS.
5,Very easy to install sounds great
5,For 20 bucks you can't ask for anything more.
5,Great inexpensive stereo. The blue lights are a little tacky in my car but that's a preference thing.
5,Bought this for a truck easy to install and works perfectly!
1,Product would not power up.
5,Great car stereo for the money. Great way to update to a stereo with bluetooth.
5,Sounds pretty good  I really like it  it’s worthy
1,Literally had it in for 5-10 mins started to really enjoy it until the sound got really loud out of nowhere. I turned it down and then after a bit it got really soft again. Disappointing. I would not recommend it unless you really want to deal with that.People before me were apparently having the same issues I should have read through them first.
1,After having this product for a short time it just quit working for no reason at all. I checked to see if it was a wiring or fuse issue however both of those connections were pristine. I’m very disappointed in this product as I held the Boss brand high on my list. I unfortunately will not be buying another Boss brand again.
1,Installed on my boat just for some tunes didn't expect much from it but working would have been nice. Good thing I only wasted $20 on it from Amazon Warehouse. Not going to worry about returning it don't feel like fighting it out of the dash again until I decide on purchasing a better unit
3,Es buen producto
1,The stereo was initially easy to install and worked well.  The next day though it quit working.  It would only barely light up and the display stopped working.  Also there was no more sound either.  I was hopeful I had beat the odds on this but I was sorely mistaken.  Go ahead and give it a shot but I got stung on it.
5,Bluetooth connects instantly. Good stereo for the price.
5,The product worked great and was better then the existing stereo.
1,The radio stopped playing 30 minutes after I installed it.Everything else works but what's the sense of having a radio that cant play radio.Had already thrown away the box so I can't return it.I'll stick to the more reputable brands getting a Kenwood instead to replace this.
1,Does not play loud. If put up volume high it shuts off. I calle manufacturer. Who said to use all wires provided ao I did. Thing still ahuts off on me. NO good
5,Good stuff works great
5,Llego en las mejores condiciones
5,Perfect for my daughter’s car! She loves it!
5,Simple and it works great. Bluetooth function is awesome
5,simple head unit if you just want bluetooth or aux.
1,I got this radio less than a year ago at first it was great now it doesn't work
1,I wrote a review about this stereo the day after I installed it and the very next day it stopped working. I'm sure it was wired properly and I'm having the same issues other people do where the display won't turn on and none of the functions work but the blue lights stay on even when the car is off. I didn't expect much from such a cheap radio but I did expect basic functionality.
5,Good
1,sorry you get what you pay for the display does not work after 1 month had an issue with using the usb portion. stays on after you shut down display shuts off with music playing in back round. I am sure this unit was the only one  that was a defect cant prove it so I wrote this review. see others write about the same problems.
3,Not offering a patch cable was a real bummer.
1,did not get a chance to use sounded ok for a couple minutes then while trying to set stations it went into a mute mode and will not come out. Tried to reset to factory defaults as per instructions but nothing happened. I have trying to reset for last 2 days. I give up
2,Bluetooth connects great. I took the time to wire it up and no sound came out. Everything was wired right the adapter that came with the radio doesn’t work🤷🏻‍♂️
2,It sounds good but... the Bluetooth doesn’t want to stay connected I have to restart it every time I want to connect to Bluetooth.
5,no problems does what I wanted it for. received very promptly
5,BUENA APARIENCIA SUENA BIEN Y ME HA RESUELTO CON EL BLUETOOTH CUANDO GUIO
5,Works GREAT sounds great fit perfect and easy installationgreat price.
2,JUNK... Installed this headunit January 10th it is now February 11th and the display screen is frozen on "GOODBYE" would not suggest this product to anyone.. In the time it worked it worked descent but with the screen not working its junk to me.
5,Love it
1,The unit feels cheap - which isn't surprising for the price. Mid-range sound is weak eq presets and adjustments are too basic to compensate. Hands-free calls cut in and out.Configuration is super easy. I've had no problem with playing music from my phone via Bluetooth.*Update* the unit is unresponsive. Lights stay on even when car is off. It worked for a couple of weeks then died.
1,Ok radio for the money sounds good on bluetooth however there is often interference on FM channels not a big deal because I mostly use bluetooth but still noteworthy. The install was easy and painless has all the features I want and need.**UPDATE** The radio freezes when something is plugged into the USB slot. This causes the radio to reset which erases all presets. I'm pretty disappointed in this radio I can't say I'd recommend this to anyone.
5,This works great on a ford escort Se 98 fits perfect
1,It doesn’t use the standard aftermarket plug.  So you have to rewire everything to make it work.The sound quality sucks. And the settings change on a whim.  This device will soon be replaced.
5,It was easy to install looks great great price i like it alot.
5,hooked it up to my back yard solar system instant tunes
5,Works great would definitely recommend and would buy it again
3,Pro: Cheaper Bluetooth includeCon: Works only six months
1,The sound is not good.  You have to turn it up to 30 just to hear anything.  The blue tooth does not pair upand it shuts off by its self.
5,I put this in my old pick up and it sounds great!
5,It quit working after a week.  Lesson learned... Never buy the cheapest.
5,Es muy bueno para el previo que tiene
5,Easy install. Easy pairing. Loud and clear. Good reception. Decent looking. For the price you cannot beat it.I'm an Ex "The Good Guys" car auduo sales/installer... It's good.
5,I put one of these in my CVPI and i love it.
5,Funciona bien...
5,Fits sound good and easy to install....nice radio!
5,Does everything i needed it to do
5,Easy to install easy to use nice screen easy bt connection
5,Installed on my Bronco good sound and easy Bluetooth pairing
1,Don’t get it turned it on 2 times and now it won’t turn on and there’s nothing to help you when it happens.
5,Easy to install easy to use.
5,Used it on 2004 ford Taurus.  Was fairly easy swap.
5,Awesome
5,Easy install. Easy operation. Good sound.
5,Great product for an affordable price.
1,Worked great for 2 months. Out of the blue has no sound coming from it. Had to put stock radio back in while I look for a new stereo. It was good while it lasted
5,Nice perfect for me.
5,Excelent sound i like it
5,FOR A INEXPENSIVE STERIO THIS ONE KICKS BUT.
1,I know that with a 25$ radio there are bound to be some manufacturing defects. And with electronics they either die right away or last forever. I purchased and returned 3 of these radios trying to find one that would work. All did fine for about a day or 2 befor dying. Sad because I like the way it looked and it sounded fine. Just so poorly made.
5,Radio sounds oksounds good when connected to my phone
5,Buen equipo
5,Works great. Auto connects to phone via Bluetooth every time
1,I thought this got poor reviews because people may not know how to properly install a head unit. But you really get what you pay for. The radio works well. It will stream Bluetooth music for about 30 minutes then it sounds like it's skipping like a scratched CD would. I'd rather listen to my engine buzzing along the highway. I haven't tried utilizing the auxiliary input yet.
5,Sharp looking unit and easy to install.
5,A good sound and what I like mostly is the bluetooth. Now I can use my phone hands free.
5,Easy installation and setup.
5,Ok for the price
5,Very good sound for this price better oem radio..
5,Its dope I love it. Works perfect.
5,Great radio for the amount
1,the product is of poor quality I work less than four months I stay I turn on the blue buttons and the knob it does not turn off it does not turn on the black screen does not sound necessary and I demand a refund because it sold me an article of bad quality  I have pictures of how this equipment does not work.
5,Like that it’s bluetooth and it looks updated.
5,Excelente estado todo funcional
3,Pretty good for its price
5,Works as it should. Nothing special but performs as expected.
1,I was happy with it for 10 months then it died. Buy only if ok with enjoying it for only a few months.
5,Works great prices great delivered fast would buy it again
4,👍
5,Bluetooth connection is great and works as it should.
5,Radio came quickly & was easily installed. I like the radio & plan on ordering a couple more..
5,Functionality of this little guy is great!  Built in amp is a little distorted at higher volumes but totally worth the price!
5,Love it for the price range!
1,The cables were not working & could not find replacement.
5,Great!
5,It is pretty stubby  great for cheap
5,easy to hook up and works great and looks awesome in my vintage  porsche
5,This radio is surprisingly good considering how cheap the price is!
5,Buena relacione entre el precioby la calidad
5,I have complaints!!!Very good for the price!!!
5,Llego tal como lo publican
3,Does not play cds please note that
1,Would of spent more if I knew it was such a crappy bracket
3,The look simple and easy to installed
5,Great value for the money
5,The sound lacks low end but for the price this radio is fantastic!
5,Great radio great price easy to install
5,Good
5,Love this stereo!! It is awesome and has a USB phone charger built in.
5,I loved the easy install. Pull and plug boom!
5,10/10 so good for the price
5,I'm amazed how well this works when compare to the cost. I love it.
1,While it looks good in pictures and upon first receiving it but you will hate it after the first car ride. Some FM stations came in as static that fluctuate throughout my drive. Bluetooth is intermittent while also giving of background noise whenever playing tracks but 3.5mm jack works great. YOU WILL HATE THAT UGLY BEETLE THAT YOU CANNOT GET RID and those useless equalizers displays.
5,Wow this unit looks awesome and sound like it looks!
5,Very good product and fast shipping.
5,all of its features work marvelously .
1,This radio is a POS 1st month of use it was ok. Now after my return date has passed some day the radio will not turn on and other days it does not shut off even after vehicle is off. Would not save my radio stations hands down I know it was only $35.00 but come on do not waste your time!
5,For $30 this is an incredible value. It really does everything in the product description.
5,Doesn't get great reception directions aren't clear
2,Bought two of these units. The first one works fine the second had issues outta the box. Everything works except the display screen. Not bad head unit for $30.00
5,It's super cheap but it works great. I thought it would kind of suck but for listening to podcasts over bluetooth it's been fantastic!
1,This brand and item are complete crap!  I installed this deck literally five minutes after I installed it the screen started glitching and the entire screen went crazy.  Now the entire screen is dead and it won’t work.  Seriously?  This brand is a complete scam.  I can’t believe anyone would ethically sell this product.
2,I cannot p/u any AM Stations.
5,For the price and ease of installation you cannot go wrong.
2,This should be professionally installed. Otherwise requires knowledge of reading electrical wire diagrams and intermediate small voltage electronics installment. Not for the novice not plug and play. Makes a nice DIY project if you have the time.
1,Clock won't stay on right time.. sounds is really not good at all.. You can't even see the screen cause it is so deemed
5,Easy to program and very easy to use and very good clear and strong sound
2,Product works and was great for about a week until the LCD screen blurred out. Stereo still works but you can't see what station you are on or sound source.
3,The MP3 is perfect but the FM radio only scan old numbers making it irrelevant in Kenya 😁
5,It is very easy to set up. Doesn't weigh much bluetooth works seamlessly.
5,Was more than i was expecting for the price I paid!
3,Works great
1,When I put the volume up it turns off
5,Love the radio however you need the bracket for the 2001 Jeep Cherokee
1,Radio was good for about 8 months then sound stopped. Has 3 yr warranty and they sent new speaker harness but didn’t fix problem. They expect me to pay shipping to send back to try and repair. For how cheap the radio was that useless might as well buy a new one from someone else
5,Sweet radio!! Easy to install and connect to BT would definitely buy again.
1,Head unit continues to blow the 15 amp fuse located at the rear. Verified all connections with harness tested with an additional head unit connections are fine main fuse is stable. Replaced unit fuse 3 times and it blows instantly. This unit is trash after 5 weeks of use. I really enjoyed it while it lasted Maybe I just received a bad egg.
5,Si quedó bien en mi troca
5,Excelente artículo
5,Everything works fine ! Only thing is i wish the equalizer was a bit more adjustable.
5,For the price and very pleased
2,Not impressed with this. Couldn’t get it to power on and the wiring was faulty which is why it wouldn’t power on. Used tools to test the lines and they were dead.
5,Great head unit. No issues installing and everything works flawlessly
1,Very poor quality. I finally got around to installing this in my beater car and it worked for a few weeks before the speakers popped a few times and quit. Of course I’m past the return timeframe now. Would not recommend.
2,Since I installed it in the car it only works twice because it always turned off and it did not work I still have not been able to use the radio because it does not turn on.
1,I installed into my over the road semi truck and after one week I have to get another stereo or figure out why BT is not working
2,You get what u pay for!
5,Sounds great works great but I had to buy a kit for my sentra 2006
1,First off the knob broke off immediately it came out of the box. The radio isn’t all that great the Bluetooth is mediocre and the Aux In ruined my new aux cable. I got rear ended back in September and it flew out of the socket and flew into the back seat... it was $21 so you know the saying “You get what you paid for”
3,Not much power
5,Excellent product I love it! It improved my audio quality!!!
5,Great tool
5,Todo muy bien. Solo falta instalar y probar.
5,Esta super chido m encanto tiene lo k keria muchas gracias
5,one day delivery and great sound.
5,The blue tooth options
5,Very good for the money
5,Easy to connect and easy to use good price
5,Works fantastic in my car!😊
5,works great! bluetooth works great!!
3,👍🏻
2,Ive had it about 3 months and I've had to disconnect it to get it to work once and just the other day it stopped working properly
5,No issues at all! Great way to add bluetooth to an older car!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Everything was fine at first until the text on the screen started messing up. Im not sure what's going on with this device but I'd stay away. I would like my money back since it appears defective.
5,I like the quickness of my item.
5,Excellent Radio when you compare price for quality
2,I haven’t even had this installed in my boat for a month and the display already went out. Beware of purchasing this!!
1,Purchased as a temporary radio until I could afford my matched system.  Package arrived quickly and installation was straight forward and simple but the unit sound goes off and on at odd intervals.  Checked connections carefully and the issue is with the stereo itself.  It will still work but would never purchase as a long term unit.
5,Sonido fiel
1,on power up blew 20A B+ 12V fuse in auto fuse panel. all connections correct not my first radio replacement. ordered replacement Pyle radio identical connections.  normal operation. returned item for refund.
5,Excellent product
1,The display on the radio is so dim that you can ONLY SEE IT AT NIGHT. Impossible to see during daylight hours.
1,Worked great at first but when using it while the car was off then turning the car on the radio would just make a loud noise that couldn’t be stopped by turning the car off. It wouldn’t stop until I unpluggged the battery. On top of all that I got in my car this morning and it wouldn’t turn on at all.
5,Boyfriend loved
5,For a pretty good price works great for my boyfriend’s 2009 Acura Integra
5,Works great on toy RAV4 2007
2,It works but the Bluetooth connection is not so great. It cuts on and off when I'm listening to music. I may gotten a defective device or if it's just too low quality
5,Awesome sound and fit right in
5,The best
1,I just open the box after 6 months I ordered it  I just to hooked up in my car but the radio never came on I check the fuse I checked the wires. It’s getting power goin through it but the radio is not coming on
5,Fast delivery and good product
5,Fit well works very good so far better control of the equalizer over the factory radio
1,I like what I got for $30.  I put it in a cheap car.  Maybe if I paid more it would come with a dimmer.  The Bluetooth works great.  The call is clear and the person on the other line says it’s clear too.Update: 6/28/19Screen quit working
5,Great product. Great company to deal with.
1,Doesn't have lpf or anyshit like that if you have a sound system. Good for your highschool kid though
5,It works great fast shipping
1,Cheap about the best thing going for the radio. NOT displaying the clock all the time as an option is just STUPID engineering.
5,For its price I cant imagine doing better!!!
5,Easy to install and sound is very good
5,Great product for the price!
5,Bought speakers and radio what a deal
2,Worked great until the sound quit working after about a month of use. The blue light and flashing bars on the display are extremely bright at night even on the low illumination setting.
5,Great radio and affordable. Easy install.
5,Love it!
5,Hasta el momento está trabajandoMuy bien lo recomiendo
1,This radio worked great for the first week and then the display went so i returned it for a new one which immediately fried my gauge cluster when i plugged it in but other than that it worked like advertised for the first short while. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,I have been using it for a month and the  Bluetooth stopped working very disappointed
3,My husband liked it
5,So far it works at described
5,So I love this radio/mp3 player.  It looks good upgrading the vehicle appearance and works very well.
5,Excellent product at an excellent price
2,The unit worked well enough but only lasted a year.
2,Display went black after 1 day. knob broke and found on floor. Everything looked and worked great for 1 day. Then the Display went black. the sound and functions seem to work by no display makes it almost useless.
5,Who’s not digital yet
5,Works perfectly
5,Still works great thank u
5,Awesome. Cheap.  Easy.  Just wanted subs in my car.
1,Checked all variables Doesn’t keep its memory after I turn the truck off . But I’m a truck driver  only bought it because I needed something cheap with  bt function for my work truck .. bt works .. great if you can read Romulan  too lazy to return it ..
2,You get what you pay for.  Wasn't looking for features or good sound quality.  Just a working radio.  Less than 2 months non responsive now
5,Perfect upgrade for my old truck.
5,Looks and sounds great.  Like the product
5,Seriously not bad for the price....wish it had an equalizer.  Other than that Bluetooth really works
5,Installed in an 02 wrangler works good
5,Works great
5,Recomended
5,very good quality product with this price
5,Work for 5 months
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Great product
1,NO SOUND TOTAL JUNK DEFECTIVE
5,THIS IS AN AWESOME DEVICE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
1,Everything worked surprisingly good for the first week within the second the volume knob was super unresponsive and days later the screen stopped working. :/ Would recommend if you need something temporary for less than a month not if you want something to last you for the long term.
5,Really nice radio for it prices amazing sound and look.
5,Nice functional radio
5,Great audio...easy installation...
1,Bought it because it had good reviews none of the speakers worked. Wouldn't play no sound from any connection. FM/AM Bluetooth Aux nothing would play. Have to give it a 1 star but in my opinion it swerved 0.
5,works great in mf tractor makes day go faster when bushogging
1,Volume knob doesn’t work right. It will shut off randomly making you completely take it out just to unplug the power source. It is what you pay for though. It’s in a work truck so I just bought a cheaper one from China and it works great! BOSS products have always been junk!
5,the affordable price
1,Well it works (alittle). This radio feels cheap all the way around. However besides that the actual use of the radio is junk. Dont waste your time. Just order one that's a little more expensive and be happy.
5,All around great item for price excellent equipment!!👍
5,Muy vuen producto
5,Works great. Sounds good. Was easy to pair up with my phone.
5,So far so good.  Great stereo for the price!
5,Solid sound strong clean bass easy to use
5,Nice
5,For the price it can’t be beat. Bluetooth works great
5,Nice stereo satisfied with the product and fast shipping
3,Great for the price
5,This is a really good Radio
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Does not work. Dont waste your money. Called boss tech support. Their answer was try it in another vehicle. Tried in 4. Would not stay powered on. Wont be using boss products  again.
1,Just opened to install today NO wiring harness NO plug of any kind and NO remote very pissed off
1,For the first 2 weeks it worked just fine the Bluetooth would automatically connect to my phone. After just two weeks the Bluetooth stopped working and that's the reason I bought this stereo in the first place. Save your money and buy a different model I don't recommend this stereo.
5,Awesome!
1,This thing a real piece og crap.Bluetooth works fine but the sound quality is grabage. The radio is trash.The worst part is that it keeps on freezing and won’t turn off or on. I have to physically disconnect and reconnect it from power to make work. Landfill next..
5,Very easy to install
2,Worked for a little over 1 year then died. Probably worth getting a higher quality one.
1,I purchased this in January but did not have it installed until February inly to find iut the stereo does not work. Ended up having to buy a new stereo and having it installed. Then found out I couldn’t return the broken stereo be cause I was outside of the return window.
5,modernizes your car with cell phone capabilities :D
5,For the price you can’t beat it!
5,Lo mejor que e comprado
5,Excellent radio for the price
5,It works great for me and great price Bluetooth feature is awesome.
5,Eady to install..great sound
1,What i didn't like is that once I connect it it auto says goodbye and turns off it didn't work will see if I can get my money back
1,Wouldn’t turn on for more than 3 seconds
2,I plugged in amp it fried the head unit so now it always stays on and won’t turn off when the car is off
1,Not touch screen! The Bluetooth won’t work properly. Worst radio ever! Do not buy!
5,Is exelente  and very cheap
1,This seems to be good but after one week lcd display has gone i believe there is a problem with the input voltage because when car engine is off somethimes it works. But after six months is completely dead. Is cheap but installation is expensive i do not recomend this one.
2,Se Bloquea!!! y la única manera de desbloquearlo es retirando y colocando la bateria
5,Basic but works
5,Just right . love it.
5,Great radio. Great features.
5,Great product especially for the price!
5,It works great has great sound and it easy to use.
2,The day after installation the screen stopped working or just showed random pixels on the screen. I returned it.
1,I purchased this item on March 3 2018 and it seemed to work great. My teenage son was very happy with it. It is May 3 2018 and the product is completely dead. Checked all connections and fuses on the vehicle and those are all good the radio just died. My return window has alr day closed.
5,Excelente la marca BOSS es de buena calidad
1,This is the worst. Bluetooth is horrible quality. The people you call will never hear you.AM radio is horrible too. Stations overlap so its impossible to listen to.Total waste of money. And now I have to uninstall it and install something better!
5,for tye priceas go for it
1,I returned it because it kept cutting off after a few seconds. It also dawned on me that this Boss is NOT a Bose.
5,Installed easily after an aftermarket kit
5,Really nice
5,Just as discribed . Easy to install and great quality.
5,So far the product works great and sounds amazing
1,I am an experienced car audio installer and ran into trouble when getting this installed. It was wired correctly BOSS makes it very simple but upon start up the unit started smoking real bad I wouldn’t recommend this headunit just dish out the extra money and go with a reputable brand
5,Great product
5,Easy install. Works just fine
5,Buena compra
1,Unit looses programming several times. Have to save programming again.
5,great radio for the price..
5,fit great in my 2001 Corolla
5,good value working as expected after a full week of use.
5,Recomendado
1,This radio is horrible!! It didn't even work. Thought they were something wrong with my car but it was the radio. I don't even want to rate 1 star.
5,Works just fine
5,Muy bien
5,Muy buen producto
2,cheap and affortable its good if you dont have a radio probably a bit better than stock but not if you want really good quality
5,Radio fit perfect
5,Great sound at a great price!
1,Al principio funcionaba bien Después de un tiempo de uso empieza a pararse la música por Bluetooth inesperadamente o el radio se bloquea y no enciende y la única manera es quitando la batería y volviéndola a poner no lo puedo regresar por que no está en los Estados Unidos
5,No complaints
1,It is cheaply built and when it arrived after spending an hour installing it big surprise it didn't work. Checked power leads for power and all was good. Do not waste your time or money. Cheap radio equals waste of time.
5,Awesome radio
1,I had to change my rating on this product. After 3 weeks the screen is black. You can only see the eq. Now I have to guess Everything.  Sounds great once you make adjustments. Does have feedback with radio but not with bluetooth. Well worth the cost.
5,Works great
5,Replacement in my Jeep
5,Nice equipment. Meet my expectations. Fast delivered.
1,Stopped working within two weeks. I guess you get what you pay for
1,Junk. Do yourself a favor and just light your money on fire. Hooked up and it came on for 2 minutes. Display never worked. Just wanted something cheap for golf cart. Should of read reviews
5,Doesn't feel cheap and looks and works great Bluetooth is flawless
5,Price was right. Works great
5,easy to use
1,Didnt work but few hours  .  Turned on the vehicle.  Nothing  came on .
1,every thing was good til I cranked the truck  nothing but noise.  ok I thought it was the truck.  not  turned on some cnc equipment 200 ft away.  same.
5,Execellent product
5,Love it
1,Garbage. Played for 15 seconds and the display died wouldn’t power up again then randomly weeks later it started working and died again. Refuses to play music through the speakers again.Send me a replacement.
5,Fast shipping great product
1,If I could give less stars I could don't waste your money the cheap Pyle head unit is better than this junk and that's saying something played for literally 2 minutes then freezes shuts off then won't come back on bought it for my beater you get what you pay for
5,Really cool Bluetooth connection fast and easy to install
5,Excellent stereo for your beater car
2,Bluetooth feature failed after two days. Used in a highway vehicle. No rough roads. It just quit working.
5,Good
5,Great
1,After installing I notice the clock function isn't working properly. The time keeps reseting itself. Also you have to press a button every time you want to see what time it is. Can't get the clock to display constantly. Bad programming.
5,Muy buen producto
5,Very Good
1,Had to buy 2 of these. 1st one didn’t work at all and I thought I did something when working it so I ordered another one. 2nd one worked for about 3 weeks and screen went dark. Can’t see a darn thing in it. All LED display has ceased to exist.
5,Excellent product
1,This is not a top of the line head unit. This is the cheapest one on amazon right now and it functions. The buttons feel cheap but they 'click' when you push them. There's a permanent  picture of a vw car in the middle of the displayUpdate*** sometimes it won't turn on or off.
5,Great product. Easy install took me from bucket to ballin..
1,The first time I bought this it came to me defective. Would not power on at all.Second time it was fine and worked for a few weeks. Now it randomly turns off to the point that it happens every few seconds.Going to be buying a different brand.
5,Nice stereo for the money
5,So far so good. Works for what I need it for. Definitely a bang for your buck.
5,Price
5,Used in a hot tub audio system
5,Good cheap radio
5,Great for the price. Fit perfect
5,Ez and friendly used!!!!
2,Firstly let me say that I enjoyed this product for the incial 3 weeks it function. The radio literally just stopped working......
2,Its a $20 radio for sure
5,Excellent product my needs!
2,Power is off every once in awhile when I start the truck. Radio doesn't pick up near as many channels as the factory radio did
1,This head unit has decent power output but the worst reception I've ever heard. The stations go from clear and powerful sounding to muted and simply un-listenable I've gotten better reception on a 30 year old Walkman. I had to uninstall and return it. Spend a few bucks more and get a better brand especially if you want to use the AM band at all.
5,Excelente Producto hasta ahora no me ha fallado
5,Great product
1,have bought three of these and all three quit working within a year.  first one screen quit.  second one just wouldnt turn on one day.  and third the volume wont change.
5,Great product for price.we put in our camper
1,Bluetooth functionality is terrible when it’s working it’s intermittent and it also interferes with other Bluetooth devices in the car. It doesn’t belong in a car it belongs in the trash. DO NOT BUY!
5,Works great for my 2003 Chevy Blazer so far. Installed it myself!
5,easy to install and excelent sound sytem
1,I cheaped out and regretted it. For me I wouldn’t put this in any car other then maybe one you were getting ready to sell and it did not have a radio or it was broken but that’s about it
5,sister like it using it for 10 months and no problems
5,Works great dose get a little warm tho for my liking
1,This unit has only worked 2 times.  When the key is turned on it lights up for just a second then turns off.  It keeps looping thru this attempted startup without turning on.  Not worth shipping it back I already threw away the box.....
5,Yes
5,Love it
1,Took to the professional car stereo installer  UNIT WOULD NOT TURN ON.
5,Had low espectations but was impressed nice quality audio and works great also no problems installing on a 1997 mirage
1,The Outer frame of the radios retaining clips we're snapped and it is not staying on the radio.
5,Good quality and price
5,Ok
1,Bluetooth connectivity is terrible on this thing spend a few extra bucks and get something that will actually work.
5,Muy bueno
5,damned good stereo ... loud... usb.... aux... bluetooth... sd card...
5,I like this radio.
5,It is great!
2,Ordered this February 9 2018. Not even 2 months later and the display already doesn’t work. You get what you pay for.
5,For the price you can’t beat it sounds great
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Realice la instalación..la pantalla no funciona.. no enciende.. lo malo es que no podré devolver. Lo compré en USA. Pero lo traje a Suramérica. Intenté el reset como indica el manual y no funcionó.. sigue sin encender display. Solo lo puedo ver con una linterna.😏
1,Audio stopped working after 2 weeks. Even when it was working the sound was poor. What can you expect for 29$ Not even bothering with returning it straight to the garbage!  My brother has one and it's still working so I guess it's hit or miss.
1,I installed this Boss Audio System in my car and it stopped streaming audio from my phone within two weeks. It will still connect phone calls but it will no longer play any audio off my phone. 10/10 don’t recommend.
5,Works like advertised
1,The first one I got didn't work at all. A replacement was sent. The 2nd worked for about 5 minutes then it shut off. It wouldn't turn on again I checked the fuse connections etc. Literally a waste of time and money.
5,Work great
5,Nice radio for what i needed
5,Love it
2,Get what you pay for the phone calls suck there is a long delay and the person in the other end cant hear you.
1,I originally purchased the stereos a backup for the one in my truck. The one in my truck finally went out and I put this one in and this one didn't work at all.Complete waste of money as it's too late for me to send it back.
5,Great stuff fit perfectly
1,The first one worked fine for a week and then the Backlight stayed on when the vehicle was off.The second one worked fine for a day and then developed the same issue.Kills vehicle battery overnight. I would not purchase again.
1,I took the radio to the shop and had to pay for nothing cause the radio didn't power or turn on... So it was a big mistake buy this radio.
5,It works! Great Value
1,Doesn't work with a 2004 Toyota 4runner at all. Audio only came out through the front left speakers.
5,For being cheap... it's pretty good.
5,It wad missing a small front side screw.
5,Works great on Bluetooth
5,Excelent product !!
5,Still working after 8months
1,Absolutely trash BOSS. I've got two radios so far and both have been burning up. Getting hot and even smoking. And yes I have it wired properly. It's just your deck that is absolute trash.
5,so far works great
5,Works great and sounds good
5,Can’t complain for the price!
5,Excelente calidad.
1,Lasted one month out of the 90-Day warranty
1,Bluetooth seldom works. Not completely happy with this. Only because of the price.
2,Says it's supposed to come with a remote. And it did not!!
1,It keeps resetting it self
5,Working good
1,Terrible it still doesn’t work and now I have No music for my hour ride to work.
5,Good deal
5,Good
5,Great radio. With blue tooth at a great price.
1,I was looking for something for my deck nothing fancy. I purchased this unit and it is totally dead no lights no nothing . I dont know how it works because it doesn't.
5,Good price and it works well.
5,Very good
1,Has no sound . junk
5,Looks nice sounds good
1,Well after 3 months the radio has died.  The bluetooth worked for about a month but it does have an aux port so at least I could stream music that way.  I cannot recommend this product.
5,Love it...
5,works great
1,It wont even turn on now. I am disappointed. I guess you get what you pay for.
5,Love the sound
2,After a flew weeks it stop working in my 95 C280
4,Sound is not the best but good for the money.
1,Purchased as a replacement for the identical model. Lasted about 5 minutes. Speakers cut out. unit still has power and the sub is still going. Hopefully they have a warranty.
1,Don’t buy this radio!
1,the radio was what i expectedexcept i didn't expect the phone part of the bluetooth to quit working after two weeksit still plays music off my phone but i can't make or recieve call via the bluetooth
5,Good product
5,Great Value ...quick install & Daughter loves it!!!
1,Didn't last one week. Pretty disappointing. Screen went blank.
5,bueno
5,Works good overall and it’s cheap
1,Wired it up but all it does is flash AM and then Goodbye.  Cheap garbage!
5,good price point for the product
1,Horrible pile of poo. Sounds badhas trouble connecting to bluetoothand now is completely broken. Less than a month old and went dark. I reset and only half the display worksno bluetooth connection at allno radio. DONT BUY! The old saying of "You get what you pay for" was never truer.
5,Excelente
5,So amazing for the price and easy to use!
5,Exactly as described
5,works great
5,Highly valuable
5,Good product
5,Muy buen precio
5,Just what I was looking for...Thanks
1,Cannot mention anything about Bluetooth connectivity touch screen or sound quality because it does not work.
5,Everything functions as expected. Nice features.
1,that radio is bad it fries me a lot and the music plays it 5 seconds later and even to look for music is a problem cada vez que lo pruebo más recomiendo full que no lo compren las bocinas suenan cuando quieran se frisa mucho
1,Radio literally quit working after a week. Everything was great while it was working. It's glitching. The screen doesn't show anything at all and when it does it's broken up is ineligible. I'd rather pay the money for something that will work verses this crap.
1,I liked that it worked  but after about a month  the clock wouldn't keep the correct time anymore and a week and a half later the rest of the radio just stopped working
1,The sound quality is horrible and the microphone for Bluetooth is awful. Would not recommend.
1,Sorely disappointed. Within the week of buying the radio the Bluetooth audio randomly skips when connected to my phone to the point that  the music isn’t audible. I tried connecting my phone with the usb but the radio doesn’t want to connect. Will be returning this item ASAP.
1,This stereo worked great for ONE month and then quit.  It quit one week after the window to return this closed. I got this for my 16 year olds son for Christmas and he only got to use it for one month! Waste of money! DO NOY BUY THIS!!!!!!!
2,One year later it died
5,Great quality
2,Not worth it bad quality only 3 months of live
2,Not horrible head unit but you will need an amplifier not exactly it's fault but it should have a larger output for your speakers.not  very loud
5,Work very good on my Mitsubishi Galant 2003
5,Easy install love it!
1,Overheats and starts clipping if you turn it up too loud for too long. Do yourself a favor and get something a little pricier that will perform much better than this hunk of plastic.
5,great
2,Clock always resets
5,Great instructions works perfectly
5,Great condition
1,Purchased two and both developed intermittent power issues within first 80-100 hours of use. Different symptoms but both could be isolated to power supply. Would not recommend if you plan on using it for more than a “gap-fill” radio.
5,👌
1,This radio sucks it’s not even loud once to ever it’s garbage
1,I bought this stereo for my son's car.  I installed it and everything was fine.... for2 weeks. Then the radio stopped working altogether.  My advice is spend a few more dollars and buy something that will last more than a couple of weeks.
2,I’m not for sure what the sound is like because it’s still not hooked up
5,Awesome
1,Since install hasn't worked  Will be clear for around 30 seconds then it starts to get really hot and static start coming then there's nothing.  Gonna get another brand. Don't recommend
1,Can't see the display so it's impossible to work with - don't know what station's playing don't know what any of the settings are. Rather disappointing.
5,Easy installation great sound for good price
5,Easy to install.
1,I received the order but when I tried to set it all up the radio has a malfunction. It keeps blowing my fuses. I hooked up my other radio and it works just fine. There's a problem somewhere. I will not be buying any More boss proucts.
1,My father in law wanted a simple to use AM/FM tuner. He listens to AM stations and guess what it has poor reception. Not much to do other than buy something else.
5,👍🏽
1,Worked for less than a week maybe 10 hours in a car that I wasn't even driving I was just listening to music while working on converting my van. The screen now just lights up with no text. Sounded okay on my stock speakers before failing completely.
5,Its amazing
1,The product worked flawlessly for five weeks then locked up on the power off ‘goodbye’ message and will not get past this point even after disconnecting the car battery to discharge all voltage. The unit is effectively stuck on the goodbye screen.
1,It came with a blown fuse no power wiring harness. After all those problems were solved the radio didn't even work.
2,Good product
5,El tamaño
2,Bluetooth connection is not stable.  LCD's life time is short.
5,It's great
1,Sounds terrible when hooked to Bluetooth not worth th money. Disappointed.
5,Best bang for your buck
5,Si pretty
2,not very good quality. Bluetooth functionality is not very good especially when the speakerphone is used. Good price though....
5,mounted in my tractor.
2,Looks ok. Sounds terrible. Good for filling a hole in your dash.
5,Muy bueno
1,Easy to install but broke in five minutes.
5,Really good product. Set up is a snap.
1,Total junk. It seems to work well at first then it just has problems about 2 months. The old adage is true.. You get what you pay for. Keep searching and avoid buying this.
1,Dead in 30 days after installation.  Thought it might be good enough for a 22-year old vehicle but the unit stopped working; display backlight still works. Well it made it past the 30 day warranty.
5,Fit very nicely in my 1991 mercedes 190e
1,This product was not as advertised it is a very cheap quality the volume will only change with the remote and the sound goes in and out
5,works freaking awesome!!
5,For the price it works great
2,The eq doesn’t have much adjustment sound is low quality
5,Play music
5,Works great for the price.
5,It does everything as expected..even charges phone
5,This is good.
1,Received used radio. Display barely bright enough to see and stations already present. Hopefully the seller will make this right and I can change my rating.
1,Bluetooth does not connect sometimes and low output on amplifier
2,Got about 3 months before It burnt up and had to replace it.
5,Great product
5,Good accurate fast shipping
5,Easy to install. Sounds awesome.
5,Does everything it’s suppose to no complaints
1,Worked great for a week and now no sound.  Music looks to be playing timestamp runs so I thought it was the speakers but equalizer is flatlined.  Checked all wires anyway and nothing.
1,Radio worked good.  The radio whilst parked and listening to music started to burn and slightly smoke.  So it was an okay radio but wouldn’t recommend considering I could’ve lost my truck due to this fire hazard of a radio
1,Poor quality
5,Nice
1,Mediocre radio. Add the cash and upgrade.
1,Don’t waste your money hooked it up and the radio had no sound.
1,No output to speakers I’ve been installing car radios since the 8 track days & never bought a radio that was defective
1,Bought 3 months ago display went out no way of getting any help with item! Can not see stations clock or make changes to settings.Big waste of money but i guess you get what ya pay for!
1,This is a terrible stereo the display stopped working just after the return window and it does not like to pair nicely with any Bluetooth devices I would return this in a heartbeat if I could.
1,Bought for my company truck it did not work. Wired it correctly it turned on sound came through but when I would turn it up to about volume 25 it would shut off and completely reset.
5,Very good for the price I recommend
1,Does not receive AM stations. Changed antennae with same results. Not enough power for stock speakers.the screen is too dark and u can’t set time. Do not buy!
5,😃
1,Just installed in our trailer and it doesn't work!!! Turned on for one second then said GOODBYE! Checked the fuse its good
1,The materials are very cheap & lightweight it doesn't work well with my kids' newer phones & the display screen quit working after only a month.I didn't expect much from a radio at this price point but I expected more than this.
1,Amp burnt out on it within 3 weeks of having it in a vehicle that isnt even my daily driver.  Waste of cash take your money elsewhere.
5,Bought for the Bluetooth capability. Working really well so far. Easily installed too!
1,1st unit didn't work 2nd unit worked great since January ish then just died for no apparent reason  professionally  installed both times gonna be pulling it and replacing with a better head unit
2,Good for the price
1,Not sure if this was a problem with my car but after connecting the correct wires the first time then replacing both the wiring harness and the stereo neither worked. Careful when purchasing this.
2,It quit after a week
5,Good!
5,Exelente
5,No problems and easy to install.
5,Easy install
5,Musica
1,This radio freezes all the time! After freezing it doesn’t turn off and drains the battery of the car. If it didn’t freeze this would be a great product
5,For the price awesome easy installation.
5,Very nice media player.
5,Excellent product for the price
1,NO  ES  EL  QUE  ESTOY  NECESITANDO  NO  TIENE PARA  CD.
5,0 issues worked as should.
1,Cheap for a reason display is erratic and the unit needs to be unplugged to fix it. Sometimes it's just random symbols sometimes its half a display and sometimes everything is upside down.
5,Great product
1,Like most of the 1 Star reviewers I received a defective unit as well. My front speakers didn't work neither did my tweets and the display wasn't functioning properly. <3 1*I was expecting for it to at least function properly.-- Junk --
1,Freezes randomly when connected to phone or SD card. Worst part is it freezes with a loud buzzing and you have to pull the fuse to stop it!  5min of buzzing looking for an exit to pull off the highway is not cool!
5,Good deal.
1,After owning this for 2 weeks it froze in the position in the picture.  Even with the car turned off it was still like this... Could never get it resolved so I sent it back
1,POS. You get way you pay for.
1,ProsPriceConsBluetooth connection is finickyAfter a few months of use I noticed my car battery was draining so while diagnosing things found out the stereo is causing a parasitic drain on the battery even when turned off.Will not buy again and I would recommend against it
5,Excelente equipment. Work correctly and the sound is very good.
1,After 4 months the stereo stopped working no power.  Checked the connections all good. Checked to make sure it had power going to it it did. Spend the extra $ and go with a quality company. DO NOT BUY!!! JUNK!!!
5,Es muy útil
5,Best dang 30 bucks I've spent.
1,Every couple of days it resets all my eq settings
1,I bought this car radio in the middle of December and after a month (January) it suddenly died. It's not turning on anymore. I know this is a very cheap  radio but come on.
5,Great! Delivered as promise. Easy fit and installation.
5,Best head unit for the money. Everything works great.
5,Good
1,Had it for less than two years put it in my summer car which is driven less than 1000 miles a year so radio hardly used and the display screen completely went haywire
1,Received the radio recently hooked it up on my car and it didnt work think it was defective 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ do not buy
1,Don't buy this.  You get what you pay for.  It worked for 30 minutes.  Then got really hot and melted the connecting wires.
5,love it
5,It works
1,I liked the unit..but it just didn't last it died just outside the retrun window. No more Boss products for me.
5,It is great
5,Nice
1,It didn’t work
5,worked as it should
1,Build quality is insainly cheap and features are extremely lacking. It never really worked well and although it “worked” the stereo simply stopped working after two months.Save up and get yourself a Kenwood this is NOT WORTH IT
5,Great
1,It would not work at all
2,Bluetooth stops working after 20 or so minutes. Wack af
1,I got all the wiring set up and it would turn on say goodbye and immediately turn off. I would hit the reset button but it keeps doing the same thing. My buddy has the same one and it does the same thing
5,Great
1,For the price you can't go wrong was easy to install but a month later there is no more display but it still works with no display. The bluetooth keeps cutting in and out from day 1
1,The Bluetooth do not want to pair it’s annoying
2,Eh... junk.
1,Hooked it up and it didn't work at all. Thats what I get for $30... a tiny boat anchor
5,Great price sounds pretty good !!!
5,Nice investment.
1,Worked for a month then just quit. Lights come in. But no sound and then wouldn't turn off I had to actually unplug it to get it to go off
5,Sounds good. Bluetooth connects instantly
1,Work only for one week. Read review from 2017 with the same issue thought it would be fix 2018 boy was I wrong. After one week it just turn on but doesn't work at all.
5,Nice radio
1,Products is garbage. ..... bluetooth not working from the installation.My old original deck from toyota far far way better. I only gave it a 1 star because my review had to give it a star to submit
1,The Worst Car stereo I've ever Had the aux input doesn't work anymore after 2 weeks using it the screen have a bug don't buy it
5,Excelente
5,car
5,👌
5,easy install great sound
5,Excelent
5,As described no problems quick delivery
5,excellent item... It works perfect...
2,Didn't fit stereo holder
1,Once i connected it worked for about 1 minute then the lcd screen stopped working also when some one calls me bluetooth audio is alittle raspy and i doesn't cut off when the call is over
5,Great sounds! Blue-tooth works great with my phone. Has powerful wattage same as a Kenwood.
5,great value and sounds great!
5,for the pr
5,Works well
3,To have a modern stereo for less than $40 is great if you're on a budget or you are just cheap. It's not bad at all but is pretty bare bones as far as features and quality are concerned.
1,Just two days ago the screen completely fritzed and now it shows an unintelligible series of dashes no matter what is pressed/turned. Worked (mostly) fine up until then but it lasted ONE WEEK PAST WARRANTY?!
5,easy to install controls everything great
1,Complete garbage. Bluetooth failed after about a week. Audio output failed shortly after.This $30 turd is not worth the aggravation of installing and uninstalling. Save yourself a headache and buy an actual brand name.
1,No clear sound
1,I got a defective unit. Bluetooth connection pretty bad. Couldnt finish a song then connection would start breaking up. Had to pay installation fee now. I have to pay again to have it removed and reinstall another one.
5,Thank you
5,Enjoying it
2,bluetooth doesnt work well drops in an out
1,Worked for three days before it stopped functioning completely. Checked connections and they’re good. Wasted my time and money and will be the last product I ever buy from boss extremely disappointed.
1,It doesnt get the radio signal well. It froze on the first week so I had to reset it it keeps freezen periodicaly pretty sure it wont last a whole year. Looks good in the car though
5,LOVE THIS SO MUCH
1,This radio is a POS if u want a reliable product don't get this. You will regret it as bad as I do. At least it was only a $30 loss this time...
1,I wasn't expecting it to last forever but it lasted one weekend and died....  aux input had a hum in it which wasn't there on previous stereo.
1,Was not happy at all with this radio. The sound was terrible the antenna reception was terrible and I did not like the fact that the clock does not always show unless you push the clock button.
1,Bluetooth stopped working within 2 weeks
5,Great and sound  very good
5,Low sound
1,So I bought it for a lil starter system but it was not even worth that dont waste the yime or money to hook it up
1,They sent the item to me and the stupid thing wont even turn on. I am hoping they will send a replacement.
5,Very good for the price
1,It’s a waste of money it works but if you set volume higher it will star cutting off.
1,Used Bluetooth once now it can’t be found on any device
5,Great product at a reasonable price.
5,Worked great product for price!
1,It was great at first but after a couple weeks the Bluetooth connects when it wants to and is very frustrating one day it works perfectly fine the next it won’t connect at all
1,The bluetooth is pretty bad... It seems to be a temperature issue... It works fine on cold days but as soon as the truck warms up on warm days it starts cutting out.
5,Nothing.
1,Well I did like this deck when it worked. Thought I got myself a good deal sounded great. But it only lasted a little over a month.
1,Stay away!!!! Hooked it up played normally at first. After two days it started to only play very quietly before suddenly blasting my speakers out.
5,Fair and beautiful price
1,Installation was fairly easy and it looks nice when on but it just does not work. It mutes on it's own. Guess I just got a faulty one
1,The output on the radio didn’t even work 😡I’m out of Money paying someone to install this thing.
1,Received a bad unit. Took it to get professionally installed and the it started smoking after the guy put the connectors in maybe I just got unlucky usually boss radio last me awhile
1,Pos installed died a month after.
1,This radio does not work. I am returning
1,There is not anywhere to start a return or ask any questions of the seller. Please advise how to return this item and either get a refund or exchange it.
5,Great product for the price
1,I bought it in the month of January 2019 it was stuck the power and did not turn off I had to unplug it and with a beep.
1,Radio kept turning off after few minutes
5,Thank you! Works perfect.
5,Works perfectly
1,Lasted 6 months
5,Very good
5,price and fast delivery hadling
1,Only lasted 2 months before it just quit.  Screen froze and everything just stopped.  Wouldn't shut off wouldn't do anything.  Tried completely disconnecting power and still didn't help.
1,Horrible do not buy this worked fine to 2 days then bam will not work the lights come on and no sound horrible product not worth the head ache
5,Ok
1,This is the worst product I have ever orderd..failed after a couple months and I can send it in for repair if i pay for shipping both ways....not worth it..total junk!!!
1,Like the other reviews quit working after 2 weeks. Missed my return window by one day. Bummer. Sounded ok for a while.my fault should have paid more attention to all the other poor rebiews
1,I had it installed and it didn't even last 1 week before it caught on fire! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM
5,Bluetooth
2,Quit after two weeks
5,Works great in my car!
1,The screen doesn't even light up bright enough to see it during the day time.
1,Returned
5,works great
1,Bought for my golf cart and the display even when turned all the way up is barely visible

5,Nice unit
5,The sound is great
1,Had the radio in my car for a month and it stopped working completely. I had it professionally installed and had to pay for them to take it out so it won’t kill my battery.
1,Well for $30 I guess it lasts 4 months. Don’t know if this is a fluke or what. But it just quit working.
1,Literally had this installed for a month. It just quit. Very disappointed. Worked amazing while it was alive. Checked all the reasons why it wouldn’t work before writing the review. The deck is crap.

5,It is unbelievable to me how small and light they can make a head unit now that everything has gone digital.  I primarily use my phone for audio as most people do now and wanted to replace the tape deck (yes my 1987 Jeep Wrangler still has a cassette tape deck) with a Bluetooth capable head unit.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this unit for right at $30 and was fully expecting to spend at least $100.  I received the unit and installed the next day and have been pleased with the result.  There were some negative reviews that I found with units that stopped working or backlights that went out but let's be real people.....20 years ago I paid $200 for a head unit for my pickup just to listen the CD's skip every time you hit a pothole.  I know if you buy something you want it to work but even expensive products have problems.  If it works for 6 months and completely quits on me I will be pleased to spend another $30 to replace it.  Let's face it we live in a time that technology becomes obsolete by the time it reaches production in a year we will all want the next new thing anyway....

5,What a great stereo for the money.  Is it incredible?  No.  Does it sound good?  Yes.  Is it a great stereo when you're not looking to spend much dough?  Absolutely!  The size is perfect in my '67 Camaro with Vintage Air because the ducts are in the stereo space behind the dash and this fit whereas a standard stereo would not have.
4,I bought this to replace a Kenwood unit that was mangled by thieves that couldn’t get it out.  It made no sense to spend hundreds of dollars on a radio that would attract thieves so I popped for this low cost Boss system.  I installed it easily in about 30 minutes.  It comes with a remote which I found useful for the setup but it will probably live out it’s life in the glove glove box. Now for meat.  I am very impressed with the sound and features this radio has for such a great price.  The frequency response is adjustable over a wide range to suit individual tastes and the acoustics of the vehicle.  It’s not as good as the Kenwood but for the price it’s pretty darn good. There were a few cheaper radios on Amazon with limited reviews but this unit had over 9500 with 75% being 4 stars or better.  We’ll see how it holds up over time but for now I am very satisfied.
3,For the most part it does what it supposed to.  Now my Bluetooth won't work because it says "Pause" and it won't reconnect and you can't find out how to fix this problem so now I have to use an Aux cord🙄
5,I like that it actually fit like it was supposed to
1,This is a basic head unit that has basic functions. The illumination brightness on mine is constantly going from dim to bright & to unreadable now. The sound is just as good as a stock head unit but there is distortion at higher levels & unbearable popping in the Rf channel now too. I bought the ASURION extended warranty & it was worthless. Amazon had seller contact me for me only to respond & be told I'd get a response and thatvwascweeks ago. Now Amazon says I can't return for credit. I'm done buying electronics on Amazon & you should be too they don't stand behind their junk basic head unit.
5,First of all keep in mind that it appears reviews for SIMILAR stereos have been posted here that aren't for this exact model.  Take a look at all the features before you hit buy.Secondly keep in mind that you're only spending about $20.  If you're looking for top notch audio quality and features you can't go the cheap route.I bought this because my factory issue radio had stopped working and rather than try and fix it I just replaced it.  I decided against the more expensive version that included a CD player since CD's are becoming a thing of the past anyways.  I've found I don't miss it anyways since you can put the equivalent of hundreds of CDs on a single SD card or USB drive. The Bluetooth was easy to set up and the buttons on the radio can even control your phone (pause skip etc.).  You even have an "old fashion" audio plug if there's still something else you want to play through your stereo such as an iPod without Bluetooth.A couple of downsides that I've found: one I'm told the microphone (for when you answer calls via Bluetooth) isn't very good.  But again we have to consider the price here.  Second the menu and features do take a little getting used to.  In order to cut down on buttons several buttons will have multiple functions.  Meaning you end up hitting the volume knob to cycle through the options trying to figure out how to change the clock.  Also given the limited characters on the display you have to remember what certain abbreviations mean.Other than those minor setbacks I still thought it was a good value and didn't compel me to take away a star.  If you're just looking to replace a broken radio or upgrade your old car with Bluetooth this thing will work fine.
3,The Clock will not stay set. I gave to set it everyday.... this makes no sense at all horribly irritating.
3,It’s was a great stereo for my truck but only for about a year
3,Boss audio system
3,The sound seems ok but I hope the programmer got fired for not leaving the clock displayed.  Who cares what the source is or what station you're listening to  Very annoying w/o a clock displayed.  The instructions lack the clock setting section so the guy or gal that wrote those oughta be fired by now too I'm sure.  Maybe it was built in some 3rd world jungle where time isn't important. idk.  There's an EQ graphic that jumps incessantly for no reason full time on the display so for now I just cut a piece of electrical tape to cover that ridiculous part of the display.  It will probably require spray paint for a more permanent solution there.So to recap:Pros-good sound-all the gizmo attatchments seem to be pretty user friendlyCons- The display is unbearable in my opinion and wish I'd have bought another receiver.
4,Had the stereo for 3 years then she gave out on me. I cant complain too much though that 10 buck a year for an upgrade.
3,Perfect for the 1st year and half but one day just randomly cut out
4,It does wat I needed the Bluetooth.
2,nothing fancy at all. bass and treble are able to be modified loudness can be turned off and on fader and balance thats it. no subwoofer support (officially). im connecting my sub to the rear coaxial output on the back and using my amps built in low pass filter. theres no option in the radio for turning off or on subwoofer set subwoofer frequency phase nothing. if your getting a new radio to put in subs go with kenwood. boss is good for upgrading speakers but not adding a subwoofer. had a kenwood before this many options and features. this is suuuuuper basic. you get what you pay for.
1,I've read other reviews regarding the quality of this unit etc.  It's worked fine for me except for one thing that makes it PRACTICALLY UNUSABLE.  Very simply the DISPLAY CANNOT BE SEEN IN ANY AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT!  I am NOT kidding.  You CANNOT read the display AT ALL in any kind of bright light even with it turned to maximum brightness.It's really hard to understand how this obvious defect ever escaped the development lab.  JUST DON'T BUY IT if you have any hope of actually being able to see the display!
1,This unit failed in the first to days. It has no sound. The bluetooth failed a few days later while i was using the Rca outputs to operate an external amplifier.  The receiver only works near a station otherwise it receives nothing but hissing. The AM radio does not work at all it never did. The only thing that works now after two months is the Usb port the Rca outputs and the aux input. The output power is NOT 50 watts X 4 channels peak it is not even close. Maybe fifteen to twenty watts Rms but distortion was found to begin at 12 watts. This was and is the very last thing i will ever buy from the once great BOSS brand. To Boss audio---your stuff sucks...badly nearly all of it !
2,i bought it used to save some money and it sucks. the sound is so bad.  my phone at full volume is louder then this radio.
2,I own this unit. I have it in my 2002 Subaru Outback. The controls are terrible. Sound is mediocre. The face plate covering the LCD fell off after about a year. The AM reception is non-existent as well.
3,If you are not particular about sound quality this is fine. The blue tooth works well. It's easy to use. Its priced for what it does. This not a high end head unit as long as you don't expect that I think you will be pleased with the product. I bought it as a replacement for some non functioning parts on my block rocker it worked ok for that.
2,#1Worked for 7 months and now it doesn’t turn on. The clock shows and that’s it. 2.  while it worked the Bluetooth mic was horrible. A phone conversation on it was frustrating.
1,sound quality from anyone you're trying to talk to using the bluetooth on this audio unit is as poor as could be. I've been using it for weeks now and have to get rid of it now because it's such a hastle having to repeat myself over and over because the audio is that poor. There is no way to connect an external microphone to correct this so if making calls with this radio is important please look elsewhere.
1,After 2 days. Not working don’t buy this
1,Looks and design or nice but it can't even last a song and it just shut off completely and won't turn back on that's the frist day of having it.
1,Trash Blue tooth worked one time never again do not buy garbage
5,Excellent radio you get it for a steal!! I've had mine going on 3 years now and never had any problems with it and it was easy to install 👌🏿 I mostly use the bluetooth mode. USB port is excellent for charging my phone.
1,In less than a year the screen went bad. Now I can’t see anything I’m doing now because you can’t read the screen.
5,I have had 6 of these radios in RZR's trucks motorcycles and cars. Never had I had one single issue with any of them. I normally don't post but read a few that says the screen goes crazy. Never had this issue with any of the radios I have purchased. Great radio for the price. I will keep buying these if I need more in the future.
1,I bought this because it was cheap but it's now the volume knob is broken after only a few years use. Spin it in either direction and the volume randomly goes up and down but not the direction you want it to go. Likely a cheap PCB rotary encoder that has now worn out. I'll replace it with something of higher quality.
1,Need a crap stereo? This is the product for you
5,Quite surprised with the quality of this radio.  Low price and so far I’m very pleased with its performance. Links right up to my phone. Very simple and clean installation
1,Worked fine for a year. Then it started cutting in and out. Power still works but something inside the box was making the display dim and it would put out no sound. Sometimes it plays and sometimes it doesn't. Car stereo that doesn't always make sound! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2,Everything else in the sound system works except this thing. I've had recurring problems with the display cutting out entirely.
2,I had some problems with the Bluetooth connection. After some minutes the sound seems to be unclear and i had to restart the device to fix the problem.
1,This radio stopped working in 4 months of use I will not buy this again as I don't think its posable for it to last the rest of my trucks life . So that being sead everyone should pass on this stero.
5,Got this as a replacement for 1999 Ford Ranger radio.Took about 20 minutes to install. Sounds great really appreciate Bluetooth hands free phone feature.
1,Installed it correctly and the unit is showing no signs of receiving power.
5,Excellent!!
1,My main concern with this purchase was that BOSS is not a company I have dealt with before and I was not sure they would be providing a quality product. I felt a little better about my purchase because it came with a 2 year warranty which made me feel like they were confident in their product or at the very least Id be guaranteed a working radio for 2 years. WRONG. The unit worked well for a little over a year. It stopped working called and and was instructed to send it in. Was not offered a prepaid label to ship it in. Have had very poor sporadic communication with BOSS AUDIO customer care. They offered me and older lesser model for an exchange. I wanted something at least equal to the value of the radio and it seems communication has stopped. I have tried contacting them with no success no radio... and its been several months now. BUYER BE WARE.Not a quality product. Wont last warranty seems to be a scam customer care is horrible. Spend a little more money and get something from a reputable company!
1,I really like this radio but it has a pick of a VW bug on the display.  Won’t work in my Chevy.
1,Spent the time to install this radio it worked great for the first 2 weeks. After that it would not turn on and is stuck showing 12 a.m. Guess I gotta pull it out and try a different one huge waste of time.
1,I bought it for my Camry 2004 I had difficulties to put it in my car so I just went to the “car toys” and waited about a week for appointment just to change my radio. I changed it and after a week it just stops working at all.. I’m disappointed. It just lights up and that’s it pushing any button and it doesn’t respond at all..
1,After installation this stereo seemed as if it was going to work well and it worked properly for about one day. Since then I have had no end of problems. The display does not work I cannot use the buttons or the remote to control the stereo it will stay on after the car has been turned off I cannot see what source I am using or what frequency it is tuned to. I have tried resetting it multiple times with no luck and am very disappointed that it does not work. This was supposed help with long daily commutes but it has only lead to frustration.
5,Install was simple.  Using it is pretty simple and the instructions are very helpful.  Well worth the money and blue tooth pairing is very easy.
1,This radio was a gift. It was professionally installed and appeared to be perfect for a while until it would no longer turn on. It will only light up and constantly display  "GOODBYE". It no longer performs any useful function as if the program died. Not only do I have to buy another radio but I feel embarrassed about giving a gift that lasted such a short time.
1,Low quality. After a few months i could no longer adjust the volume I would twist the knob and it would sometimes even turn down the volume when i would turn it up otherwise it just wouldn't work. It also started slightly cutting in and out as well as having a small pop and crackle noise when using the aux. I suggest spending a bit more for better quality.Also the moving equalizer bars on the display move randomly and not to the music. They move even if nothing is playing. That was  a bummer when I first got it.
5,Great radio for the price has more power than the stock radio and drives the speakers much better.
5,Awesome!! I love it.
1,Screen doesnt turn on volume only goes to 43 please dont buy this if you want a nice head unit
5,Radio is amazing for the price. And looks 10x better than pioneers and all those other radios. Make sure to buy a mounting kit since you don't get one like crutchfield.com provides you with. I have it on my '95 Cherokee.
5,Very good
5,Extremely recommended
1,Stereo worked for 2 months until I used the USB charging port.  It hasn't powered on since.
5,Works absolutely great! For a cheap radio every feature on it works great and the sound is much better than expected.
5,loved it super easy to install to my 2000 honda civic
5,Perfect I love it
5,Nice stereo good for the price
5,Excellente radio no necesitas ser tecnico para instalarlo tu mismo.
1,I received this model as an early father's day gift and am always appreciative for any gift I receive working or not. I've had it for less than 24 hours and the display is dead. Came here to see if it is a common issue and now fear it will kill my vehicle next. I usually like Boss when it comes to music equipment like guitar pedals but now refuse to ever trust their radios. Luckily mine is breaking within the return window. Hopefully that's more successful than the radio itself.
1,Do Not BUY.Believe me this little device gave me a lot of trouble when installed in my car.It draws down the Battery when offline.
1,Not a poor rating on the supplier but I had this unit and it lasted like a year. It was basic and good but slowly had problems like turning off while driving then it blew out completely after I used the USB port to charge my iPhone. I smelt smoke or heat and that was the end of the stereo. Cheap equals cheap quality I guess.
4,I needed a cheap head unit to put into my car just to get some music. This thing works great for what I need and it sounds pretty decent too. Pushes some cheap pyle speakers I got just fine. Add in a sub and amp and it would be a decent system for someone that just wants some toons without trying to blow their doors off or win a competition. My main complaint is the bluetooth is quieter than the radio so I have to turn up the sound pretty loud when playing music on my phone as compared to the radio. All in all for $30 it'll get the job done.
5,I purchased this radio for a custom installation into an old camper I'm overhauling.The first unit arrived inoperable; Amazon immediately corrected the problem so no stars lost for bad luck on my part. The second unit works 100% as advertised so far on the test bench and it currently driving some seriously loud 80s hair metal through the house and scaring the cats.The wiring harnesses for both power and 4-channel speaker output are included making installation an absolute snap. The remote is handy...just hope I don't lose it like I tend to do with all other radio remotes.The unit is lightweight clean basic and easy to operate. It's not a fancy unit and this is exactly what I wanted for a limited-use camper.So far so good! I'll update my review with any issues if they arise.
5,Hard to believe at this price point you can get anything let alone a decent bluetooth stereo!  Got it for my boat and again at this price it gets wet I'll simply replace it!  Super easy to install and everything needed came in the box.Only issue I had was I needed a power wire for my Pre amps and this did not have one.  I looked in the Q&A and sure enough it was there and you can use the Power Ant wire instead.  I hooked it up as instructed and works perfect!
5,Working flawlessly but I cannot speak for longevity as the time frame for these reviews is short.Bluetooth connected flawless. Sound quality exceeded my expectations. Only issue is the hands free calling some (ATT) say it's not clear..Other (VZW) users have no problem. Very happy with this stereo.
5,This system is awesome perfect quality great price! Bluetooth enabled it’s a perfect upgrade to old radio! Easy installation
5,More than I expected from a cheap radio. Clock is a pita to set but not enough to drop a star. Very good 4 channel sound.
5,The radio works fine. I listen to mostly talk radio and it works fine.
5,This stereo is a great value for the cost. Bluetooth is clear. Setup was easy and trouble free
5,My daughter likes it
5,Automatically connects to my phone and begins playing from my default music app no setup required after installationFairly simple to install wires are color coded and easy to match
5,Remote has issues gotta be real close to unit..
5,Eay to installing use
5,Nice for the price
5,89 Chevrolet pickup
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Good stereo Very easy to install good for the price works fine with no problems and it’s Bluetooth and comes with the remote which is amazing so far the best stereo for the price highly recommend it for budget people.
5,Easy to install has no problems with the BT my son Loves it!
5,Bought for the husband and he said I need to leave a 5 star review. He can't believe the sound from this only being a $37.00 stereo. Blue tooth works extremely well and is a great stereo.
5,Performance surpassed price.
4,It's ok for the price you get what you pay for
4,I’ve had the stereo for a few weeks now and it’s working great. It has good sound and Bluetooth which is the main reason I got it. Been wanting to connect my phone and car stereo. I have an old car so didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a new stereo.It is unfortunate that you cannot read the screen during the day unless you are in a shaded area. Works great at night. Installation and set up was simple.I texted the aux and works well.I believe the usb May be for charging only or at least that’s what it did when I plugged into mine. (It also added some static noise to sound. I want planning on using usb so I’m still satisfied with device)
2,Bought it for my mom's truck and the wattage it says is 200 but its no where near it it's not even heavy it's a straight up lie on that but she dont care she has radio again... If it was for me I would of returned it.
5,I bought this for my son to put in his car. He loves all the features this comes with. It sounds great.  Overall it's a great stereo for a great price.
3,This head unit is a budget head unit don't go and buy this expecting exceptional quality. It works and that's fine for me. Sound quality is good the only complaint I have is the LED are so weak in the screen it's hard to see. Plus if you walk 10 feet from the car the bluetooth connection drops.
5,Cheap but works great! Got it for my 1992 Miata. I got it professionally installed. Good sound quality good controls. Bang for your buck!
5,Great
4,Pretty good little unit. Installed it in about 30 seconds in my ‘99 E320 and it sounds great even on the old Bose system. It made a loud screech for a split second one time which is why I’m docking one star other than that it’s been working flawlessly.
5,It was so easy to put in. I’ve never installed a radio but we just had to match wires and it was simple!! I did purchase some wire connectors but that did the trick. It has a good sound Bluetooth and a USB on the front. Great purchase!
5,Radio shorted out smells burnt only used for a month dont buy
5,I haven't used Bluetooth yet so I can't say.  But this radio comes with a remote control and the radio installed very easily in my Bug and it sound great!  And the price was great!  More radio than I expected for the money..
5,I received my radio and the radio works great it doesn’t have a touchscreen though. My only dislike was with the delivery I didn’t realize that it was coming postal service I prefer items that come via Amazon delivery. The packaging was not idea it was the actual radio box with a shipping label. I wish it was at least in a box so everyone does not know what is in your mailbox.
5,Thanks!!!
5,Good sound quality better than more expensive radios only thing I don’t like is when you try to talk on the phone with Bluetooth it’s hard for the people to hear you on the other end but I didn’t buy it as a hands-free deviceThe only other bad thing about it is the light on the display could be a little brighter but for the price excellent sound quality
5,This is a great stereo for the price. Clear Bluetooth from function. Great sound. It was easy to install. Great replacement for my tractor
5,Both Bluetooth and connectivity have been good. This stereo is not touch screen. I got it for my semi since it had the old kind still. I had to buy a lighter thing to connect Bluetooth through there with my old stereo but the sound wasn’t so good. That’s when I decided to try a Bluetooth stereo. I’m happy with this boss stereo.
5,Good buy serves my need for a car that’s 57 Years old!
5,Impressed by how well it works compared to how it cost. Good value compact radio makes for easy install in older vehicles as I did deeper radios that have a CD/DVD drive tend to run into the back support for the factory radio and usually needs to be removed not the case this time.
5,This is a replacement radio for my Jeep. Went in easily per hubby
1,Did not even use for 24 hours before the bluetooth and usb port stoped working put in a bit more money and get something better.
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to install. Wires and instructions very good.
5,Everything works perfect.  Bluetooth is easy to set up.
5,Great radio for the money. Easy to install and everything worked wonderful.
5,Producto llegó bien y muy rápido.
5,Good
5,It a very good radio and sound I just hate ir didnt have a CD player

5,Good radio this is the 2ed one I bought
5,Great
5,Wonderful
5,great product
5,Great product and does the job
5,No tiene buena recepción de emisoras locales el sonido . No puedo exigir más por el precio.
5,Good quality
3,Does it job for my work truck
5,This radio delivers! Easily installed and  performs well.
3,Works as it should but the display on the front is very very dim.  During the day I can’t even see what it’s saying.  Besides that I’m happy.
5,Good quality
5,Outstanding product for the price
5,When I first was thinking about buying this I was skeptical since it was so cheap but when I installed it it didn’t work so I bought a different wiring harness adapter and it worked amazing after that. So if you are thinking about buying this make sure you have the right wiring harness adapter to fit your vehicle. I highly recommend this radio!!
5,Práctico y aceptable funciona bien.
5,Super easy install! Love it
1,I hooked up the radio and all it does is The lights blink no sound coming out
5,Bluetooth is good sounds amazing
5,Used in C10 as a hidden option for blue tooth connectivity to music and phone.  Radio fit in glove compartment.
5,For the price you can't talk bad about it at all :) works very good just right for my application!!!Thanks
5,Excelente. Funciona de maravilla.
5,Works as intended.
5,I can’t believe the good price and the smaller it is. Recommend it
5,bought for a motorcycle is enclosed in the fairing and I am a fair-weather rider so not overly concerned about the elements getting to it sounds good looks good easy to install
5,Easy to set up and install
5,Very good
5,Me gustó mucho la rapidez de conexión con el Bluetooth.
5,Sounds great
4,The radio works as it should. Very simple and easy to use. The only thing I really don't like is that I don't have full control with adjusting the sound. There's only bass and treble. No mid range so the sound isn't what I was expecting. Overall it's a nice a radio but very simple.
5,Can’t ask for much with the price of the radio.. it is a Name brand..
5,I love it
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Fits a 98 jeep xj !
5,I haven't had any issues with this car stereo. Easy to install and the right thing for the price.
5,This was purchased for an old truck. It was easy to install. It’s actually simpler than my stock radio in my other vehicle because it’s super easy to connect and will connect to phone as soon as you are in car with phone you don’t have to fuss with usb or lightning cables but it also has a USB port to connect. So far so good. I like the remote option too.
5,Just needed to replace a radio in a plow truck.  The truck had subs and speakers in it.  To my surprise I was able to hook all of that back up even with the rca.  Connected to my phone. The radio will text people and connect to Google assistant.  What a win for $36
5,Customer was extremely happy with this radio. He wanted something simple and cheap. Sounds pretty good too!
5,Bought this to replace a old stereo in my travel trailer. I bought two other cheap ones and they were bad. I chose this for the price but also it’s the same brand in my truck. It works great for a cheap stereo and doesn’t make noise like the last two I bought and returned. It is basic but if you don’t want to spend a lot of money this one does the job
5,Good buy
5,Nicea
5,Good quality and price
5,Recomendado para alguien que solo le interese conectarse via Bluetooth y radio es sencillo pero me gustó
5,Good price quick shipping and works great.
5,Highly recommended ! Works Perfectly
5,Good quality item
5,All the functions work very well. A very good purchase so far.
5,Excelente producto
5,As described
5,Very good quality and super easy to install
4,No sé mucho de radio de autos solo se que boss es una marca legendaria y e visto grandes equipos de música con bocinas y radios boss y el sonido es brutal no lo e instalado solo diré que el envío llegó rápido y en buenas condiciones cuando instalé el radio actualizo la opinión.
5,Radio is good but make a call and the whole radio shuts down and has to be reprogrammed. Simply wanted a radio so I can’t complain.
5,Look good' but poor reception'
5,Works great
5,Very easy to install search some tutorials on YouTube
5,For the price it does a good jobSound quality isn’t amazing but it’s not terrible. I put it in my farm truck and works just fine.
5,Works great. Kind of bright and distracting at night
4,Ok for the price but beware that this unit does not have bass or treble adjustments or any type of tone / equalizer.
5,Price
5,Purchased for my truck and sounds great. Display is a little dim in the daylight but great at night. Sound quality is awesome. Would definitely purchase again.
4,Works great sounds better than my friends brand new car I wired it myself with no issues at all can’t beat it for $30
5,It Bluetooth connect work great and the sound quality is amazing
1,I ordered it thinking I was getting a good deal the first one stopped working a couple days after having it the volume cut out so they shipped me a replacement l It was never delivered so I contacted Amazon they said it's not there problem so I feel like I was scammed out of 35$
5,Inexpensive radio that is good for a quick upgrade to Bluetooth and more.  Put this in my 2005 Mini Cooper Type S.  This was for my wi red car so I wasn’t looking for anything robust just an inexpensive Bluetooth radio.Would highly recommend unless your looking for a touchscreen or Android Auto/CarPlay setup.  However works great with streaming Spotify on my iPhone.
5,Everything does work in order
5,Installed in a 2000 Chevy 1500 that had a single din conversion already done. Works like it should. It’s cheap don’t expect studio quality but it will handle a decent set of speakers without distorting.
5,Connects automatically to my phone with the Bluetooth feature. Just an amazing stereo setup.
4,I don't expect a lot out of a unit at this price but this works well and it has a smart control placement and layout. The volume from the media played thru the USB port seems loud even at a volume of 1 while the Bluetooth and line in are fine but it might just be overpowering my amp a bit and not an issue for others. I don't even use the USB input unless my wife is in the car so it's not a huge deal.
5,Super rápido la entrega artículo 100%
5,I bought this one because my touch screen went out so I just wanted a blue tooth radio . Easy install and plenty of sound from the built in amp. Also sounds good with my separate amp and subs  connects yo blue tooth easy !
5,Works needs universal plug smh
5,It works really good. Quality always meet by Boss products.
5,Just buy it
5,Installed on my boat today sounds great connects to bluetooth with ease. Screen is not bright at all i have it in my glove box so its doable. update; there is a screen brighter knob very happy.
5,Great item !!
5,Great product
5,Amazing lasted many years
2,it survived 6 weeks. The plastic bezel holding the radio broke after 6 weeks. it's not loud. even on high illumination the display is barely visible in daylight. At least it was cheap.
5,Works great  (installed on a Subaru Impreza 2003)
2,I’ve had this item for a bit over a month and past the warranty and it has stopped working as well as it should be the Bluetooth only works from a foot away and the screen randomly dims. And now the Unit only sends sound through the subwoofers 2/10 would recommend.
5,Simple radio nothing fancy. Perfect for what I needed. Bluetooth works great.
5,Limited bass.
5,Getting this thing set up is actually really annoying and the remote doesn't work well and I'm not sure why there's even numbers on the remote because they don't seem to do anything. Definitely a good upgrade though not disappointed in the purchase perhaps there may be a better option out there.
5,Just installed it in my car. Wiring is simple and straightforward. Great price and great item
5,I have had it in my truck for three years and I haven’t had any problems out of it The Bluetooth hooked up great I love it
5,Great item great price
5,Great price
5,Hands free in a 1992 truck is awesome!!!
5,Great ValueGreat Look
4,Great price. Got this for an old work truck. Worked great.
3,I still do listen to AM radio....too much RFI to listen to AM Radio..  Price GREAT!!!  USB works fine and of course FM is just fine....
5,Works great in my 99 f150  you get what you pay for
5,Awesome Stereo!  Fast Shipping!
5,Works great. Thanks
4,Purchased to replace an older stereo in my '93 YJ Wrangler that didn't have blue tooth. I was looking for decent sound not winning a contest. Overall sounds nice and seems to power the following speakers well: (2) 4x6 Pyle 3way front speakers (2) generic 3way outdoor patio type box speakers. My under-seat sub is a Rockville RW10CA active sub that fills in some base. Volume only goes to 40 which seems to be loud enough but it has not been road tested w/ the top off. Sound is clear at this max which is good. I am not running an amp. 616UAB Head unit offers 2 sets of RCA jacks that you CAN connect a sub to. Directions are not clear about this as it only states "pre-amp" but it works. Looking forward to Spring when the top comes off. Good luck
4,Works fine small light and installed easily. Main nit is the graphic display is fake - it just shows a preset EQ curve animation that activates on level not frequency. Is it too hard to do fast fourier transforms these days? 80's boomboxes had more legitimate audio visualizations. Other than that it's fine.
4,DISLIKE FIRST: Shipped with the front plate secured with two screws. You must remove these screws to use the security slide-keys to remove the unit from the metal installation case. Consequently the front plate won't stay snapped in place but comes loose every time you touch it. I'll mend the problem with two drops of adhesive on each side of the face plate which I can cut if I need to remove the unit.LIKES: Good sound for the price. Easy to remember programming - you don't have to consult the manual every time you need to reset the clock or re-program the pre-set radio buttons. Blue tooth feature works well as does the AV input jack.
5,This radio for the price is a can’t beat deal! Works great an sounds even better . Truly impressed for the price
5,Got the various wires hooked up and it worked surprisingly well.  Sounds good.  iPhone connected easily via Bluetooth. Hard to go wrong for $29
5,Todo muy bien estoy satisfecho
5,Works great exactly as described
5,Precio y calidad
5,Super easy installation I wish the led panel was brighter installed in my golf cart and in bright light conditions panel is hard to see.
5,perfect for what i neededeasy to installworks great

5,It works wonderful
5,good
4,Excelente calidad por su precio
3,I allowed a friend to buy it from me
5,Ok
3,Can't be upset due to the price. It sounds good and hooks up great to my bluetooth the clock doesn't stay set. but the presets do atleast. I will likely put this in my boat in the spring and put a better unit in my truck
5,Great price
5,Works great
5,I love it
5,My husband loves his car stereo. Sound is good quality Bluetooth so he can be hands free talking in iPhone and has the great touchscreen
5,Put this radio on the dock works great. Not expensive lot of options.
5,A steal for this radio! Great Item went right in 2006 Grand Caravan no issues
3,It looks great. It was easy to install but sometime Bluetooth disconnect suddenly during playing a song. It's frustrating to reconnect my phone with radio every time I set in my car.
5,I saw some bad reviews on this stereo. I guess some are glitchy. My one worked perfectly. I put it in a 1984 Ford F150. The color coded wires still matched my 35 year old truck. The sound quality is good. The bluetooth connects immediately every time I get in the truck. Overall a great product for the price. Thanks
5,My factory radio stopped working so I bought this just because I needed AM/FM. I got a good radio and a whole lot more for such a cheap price that I can't believe it! Bluetooth connectivity to my phone is flawless unit is lightweight and easily fits into a single DIN cavity. Sound quality is very high even without the use of my factory amplifier. The clock comes on only when the unit is turned off and is barely bright enough to see. But that's a small price to pay for such an otherwise great deal.
5,Good bluetooth player
5,Good good
1,It's a nice little radio for the price. The sound is good but I think that all depends on the speakers. The only problem is that it's not very loud. My 50 wat portable boombox is much louder so that was a disappointment but I'm actually happy with it. If you want fancy features you will have to pay for it.  This radio is only $30 which is a good deal.---Update----The speaker output stopped working after 10 months. The amp outputs still work and I have an amp hooked up so as long as those don't stop working I'll be good I guess lol.I know it's only $20 and you get what you pay for but I wouldn't expect a name brand radio to quit so soon.
5,Works great
3,For an inexpensive headset this is great. The remote is silly. Bluetooth is quick and easy to connect pairs and plays on every drive. Somewhat easy to install needed dash kit and wiring harness adapter. Feels loose in the sleeve not sure if that can be fixed. The only real issue I have is that the clock doesn't stay on you have to click through to see it for a few seconds at a time. Update: the clock is useless it loses several hours every night despite constant resetting. Not a power/battery issue as it keeps other settings and doesn't revert to factory 12:00 which is what happens when I disconnect power. I can deal with low quality but a basic function like a clock needs to work.
5,Great radio for the price. Bought for daughters car. Fit well. Connects to her phone flawlessly. Overall great purchase
5,Good radio
5,Great deal
5,Love this product
5,Works as it should I’d buy another.
5,Put this in my truck this thing jams added a bluetooth pyle speaker also now it really jams out
5,I had to get a separate aftermarket wiring harness to connect the factory wiring to the harness that came with the radio but this came with everything else I needed to make it work in a 1997 Isuzu Rodeo I am fixing up.  The price point made it an easy add-on when I had the dash open for other repairs.  The Bluetooth connection brings it into the modern age no use for a cassette deck or even an in das CD player these days.
3,Great for the price if you picky spend more!
5,good sounding stereo for the price bluetooth connects easy wiring is basic sound is very nice through 2 6.5" speakers. ive done my fair share of automotive audio and some people will try to compare this to a $200 stereo but for the price this thing rocks
5,Got it onsale for 40$ was worth every penny works great
4,This stereo is great value. Sounds fine slightly flat but fine on standard car speaker system. If your car has premium speakers get something else.Bluetooth is solid (no drops - short range) but I haven't found a way to switch devices without disconnecting the active device then connecting the new device - no big deal but can be a slight hassle if multiple people in the car want to share connection instead of device.Built in mic for calls is terrible phone handsfree mics is better. I'll be looking to add an external microphone of better quality. Altogether it's a steal at ~$35. Dont waste your money on +$100 stereo unless you have premium speakers.
4,BOSS 616UAB radio arrived on time by Amazon.  the price was good and of good value. installation is straight forward.  I spliced into the old existing 3rd party harness set .  i put it into my 1993 Mazda Miata.  there are always challenges installing any radio but not a show stopper.  the radio works good.  i am replacing my main speakers now to take advantage of this new radio.  I recommend purchasing.  i have not used any of the blue tooth features or hands off microphone.  i just wanted a radio but in 2020 radios come with many good features.
4,This radio does the job as advertised. It is easy to connect on bluetooth on the devices I have. The only downside is that it is like 2mm too wide for the plastic cover and would not fit perfectly in my subaru nice like I would like it to be but it sits in there a bit deeper than it should. Also there is an annoying eq light pattern that flashes random and not with the music it can't be turned off. I'll live with it.
2,This showed up with the shipping label just slapped on the outside of the box which I didn't particularly mind. However the box was also unsealed and upon removing everything it seemed like someone had already peeled off the various protective films; little bits of plastic foil were sticking out along seams still. After eventually getting it all hooked up to my car it worked fine the Friday I finished installing it... then it decided that sound was optional when I started my car to go to work the following Monday. I didn't even look at my car at any point between finishing the install and the Monday morning... Just dead. Worked perfectly for the short time it was alive though? Not pleased with this lemon though.
3,Three stars but buy this anyway if you need an inexpensive stereo. It has a couple of bells but most importantly has a radio an amplifier and an input.Doesn't sound very good its pretty anaemic no growl or bass as the preamp aren't coloured or tailored to saturate 4ohm drivers in the way Sony and pioneer know how rto do.But this is easy to install and cheap. Better than the stock system. Buy a name brand if you want some punch in the sound.
4,Muy bueno para el precio ($645 en enero de 2020) con bluetooth usb y auxiliar más que suficiente. Lo uso en un Toyota Corolla y se siente menos potente que el original.Sólo tuve un problema al instalarlo al insertarlo se iba al fondo tuve que desarmar la carátula y sacar uno de los topes que se había quedado dentro.En general buena compra  :)
4,Decenbt little unit for the price. Great upgrade for my 91 Jeep Cherokee. The wiring was a little tricky matching new wire harnesses with existing wires in Jeep. Love the convenience of playing music from my phone on bluetooth rather than annoying cords.
5,I had a minor wiring problem which was solved immediately via internet chat. Excellent customer service. A refreshing change from so many vendors that have poor after sale service
2,So far I'm giving it 2 stars only because the unit is too wide for my dash. Had to cut the opening wider and fill the rest of the hole with wood. I'll see what it sounds like once I figure out how to mount the thing.Update. Unit is installed and almost totally functional. (took me 2 days to figure out the speaker wire connections which consisted of removing my door panels to figure out the speaker configuration.) Still can't figure out the power wiring. Unit stays on when the ignition is turned off. No help at all from the Boss audio customer service. They want to charge me for answering a simple question. You get what you pay for I guess
3,Sounds better than factory in my 08 Honda Civic. The clock does not keep time and the lights are way to dim and you can't read anything on the stereo in the daylight. Bluetooth connects quickly but the microphone on the deck is of horrible quality.Overall it works for what I wanted it for (playing music in the car) but nothing special.
1,Broke 3 days after the 30 day warranty. Won't turn on. Remove power/or fuse... Replace and it says "goodbye" and turns off.Complete junk
1,Connected it to my car turns on and no sound was comming out. Used the right radio harness for my car but still didnt work. So bummed out because i thought it works but got dissapointed when the sound didnt came out.
1,This unit quit working after only 2 months. The sound quality was terrible right off the get go I should have returned it right away my bad. There is a reason it is so inexpensive it is because its cheap junk. I would not buy this or any other BOSS audio equipment in the future.
3,The player itself isn't too bad but the display is almost impossible to see and seeing as all functions are displayed on the screen  (but you can't see them)  makes it terrible to use
2,Installed and working fine for a while. Suddenly after a week stopped turning on. However power is getting to USB. I had to completely disconnect and uninstall and put it together still no use. Had to remove the fuse on the deck and put it back then it was working.
4,Has everything you would need and expect for the price. my only complaint is the display is too dim! Even on Max brightness I find it very difficult to read the display information. Otherwise it really is great value for the money.
5,Easily installed sound is good replaced my old stereo and fit hole perfectly. Bluetooth paired easily. Havent tried the usb yet.
5,This is a good deal and sounds great. Put it in my 1996 fourrunner....sounds amazing with he old gear.
4,Mon problème est avec l'horloge. Je  ne sais pas pourquoi elle retombe à zéro chaque fois que je redémarre la voiture. C'est le seul truc qui me dérange avec mon achat. Pour le reste ça fonctionne bien.
4,La calidad de sonido es de buenísima calidad sin embargo al usar el micrófono que está integrado al auto estereo necesitas casi gritar y acercarte mucho a la caratula para que te escuchen bien.
5,Despite the many negative reviews i had purchased and used this stereo for roughly a year without a single problem. Sounds great and the connectivity couldn’t be easier. Hands free calling and usb charger both work well too and aren’t there as a gimmick.
2,No me gusto la calidad del sonido la hora se le desconfigua siempre y el Bluetooth se desconecta constantemente es muy básico para salir del apuro esta bien
4,I gave it a 4 it's a nice  for the price  200w  50x4w  works well but the 3erd preset button sticks that's why it a 4 or 3.5  other than that I like it . Doesn't look too bad.
5,The BOSS car deck is just as good as any other. Simple design and sounds great.
1,The sound was distorted at times and yesterday got really bad I shut it off and tried again later and the unit has power and shows it's playing by the sound graph I checked the fuse and all connections  all we good
5,Fantastic easy install!  A little smaller than OE radio.  But super easy to use.  Easier to connect BT than OE units.  Clear call sound
4,Great value for 40.00.  Receives calls no problem.  You still need cell and "ok Google" to call from your contacts.
5,Easy to install took me 20 minutes to put into my 96 Jetta five stars because it's a great deal.
4,Works as advertised. Very simple bluetooth controls. For example from the stereo you can only call your most recent contact (that was last dialed from your phone). Also the screen is small and the clock does not show with every setting.
4,It syncs the Bluetooth very quickly which is nice and resumes playback from where it was left off. Good replacement for the stock radio in my old corolla.
1,I bought this with Pyle 4” speakers for my atv.  It sounds like a $10 clock radio.  I didn’t expect a lot for the price but I’m not going to bother to install.
5,This stereo is perfect! I don't have one complaint
3,Easy to install found the wiring was a very small gauge not that heavy duty also the unit doesn't put out much power you really have to be careful of wattage of speakers they will run
5,I put it in a kubota farm tractor.  It very easy to wire and in stall. The blue tooth is extremely easy to pair.  Love this product.
5,For the price is this is perfect. My old stereo had really bad am static. This one is much better and I can actually listen to my am station in more areas! Good buy
4,Great product and great soundeven playing music with bluetooth  it sounds amazingonly downfall  is the handsfree is hard to hearbut for what i paid you cant ask for.much more
2,Screen stopped working in one week. Everything else works well. Cheap price kinda sucks that screen failed.
4,Thank you I received
5,Je suis satisfait du produit
4,Bateau

2,Bluetooth phone calls: The person your talking to cannot understand you.
1,this product caused a short  and parasitic drain in my truck and killed the battery and blew the dome light fuse
4,Not too bad considering the price.  Sound is okay.  Could use a few more options but does the just
5,Great product fast delivery sounds good and great price.

5,Excellent value
5,Bon service
4,I love it
5,Good
3,it stopped working after 6 months I installed in my car.
5,Awesome
4,Perfect fit. I was quite impressed. There was also a bonus to putting in this little single din stereo. It hooks up nicely to my blue tooth. Kinda wish it had a little more power. But it works really well. The bonus was that the old radio/equalizer/little amp thing under the dash was really messing with my gauge cluster voltage. My voltage would always fluctuate usually to only about 12volts because there must have been shorts in the wires. Well this new stereo and less wires helped to rectify that problem as you can see. My battery voltage stays steady at 14 volts now. Super stoked about that. Good buy.
3,En mi opinión le falta riqueza al sonido se escucha un poco hueco pero cumple con el objetivo y su relación precio calidad es muy buena en general. Si lo que buscas es potencia y riqueza sonora tienes que invertir  un poco más en otro equipo. Por lo demás es un fácil de usar y de iluminación discreta.
1,The stereo is very weak.  Rated for 200 watts no gad damn way.  Pre set eq is laughable.  The illumination is minimal at best. Good thing would have to be ease of installing and uninstalling.It'll be the worst head unit I've had the misfortune of having.Product is trash.
1,Didn’t even last 6 months. Avoid.
5,Installed this in my tractor rather than the factory $350.00 option. Found the Kioti stereo wiring diagram on the internet to make this work. Good wiring instructions for the stereo came with it so was simple to install and can put back to factory if needed. Fit the cab stereo opening perfectly with proper measuring and cutting. The sound and volume is great. Can tune into all my local stations wherever I am on my land and sometimes use my iPod Touch when I want something different. Find I turn it down more than up.Not like some cheaper stereos this one remembers the last station tuned to. So when I start my tractor the station I was on will come back on.Only thing I would like it to have is a constant clock display. Not a deal breaker installed a clock with indoor/outdoor temp. due to the shortfall of this.
2,Was pretty easy to install and works fine. Still works fine after a year but sound quality is very bad invest a little more and get a Sony or Pioneer deck. Trust me you won't regret it.
4,Basic head unit. No CD player or SD slot but has Bluetooth AM/FM USB and an aux input. Sound quality is fine but I have cheap speakers too. Cheaply made but it's cheap so whatever.Good for the price but you get what you pay for.
1,me falto una piesa del productono me gusto por que me llego defectuososi lo recomiendo por que se encuentra de todo
5,Bluetooth connect very easy
5,Meh! You get what you pay for ........
5,placer dans un side x side  joue bien
5,MORE THAN VALUE FOR MONEY
5,Su fácil instalación y cumple con mis espectativas
1,Simple to install unit except it just didn't work - returned and refunded
1,Este equipo no vale la pena comprarlo no tiene memoria para guardar las emisoras de radio el reloj no se deja modificar y cuando estoy escuchando usb después de ajustar el sonido y apagas el equipo se des configura y donde tú dejaste la canción se vuelve a iniciar desde el principio no guarda ningún tipo de configuración perdí mis 34 €
3,I purchased this a couple weeks ago along with same manufactures speakers. I'm using proper speaker wire but am having crackling from the 2 speakers (new out of box) the speakers are 75w each and the stereo is 50 watt so i don't see why this is happening. not sure what to return? speakers Stereo or both? and insight from the seller would be appreciated.speaker link is here...https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000FKP7MQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
2,When the radio is out of its sleeve reception is reasonable and when you hold it in your hands about two inches out of the socket the sound is louder. Thinking that my body was acting as an antenna I unplugged the aerial wire and reception dropped out completely so that was not the issue. The radio is installed in an inner wall of a van on a side near the front while the speakers are mounted on a panel at the rear. Both the body of the van and the inner wall are aluminum. In its sleeve reception is noisy and the volume drops down almost completely. Sometimes reception is fair quality depending upon a person's position within the box of the van. Volume varies for the same reason as if a person's body is acting as the second plate of a capacitor.This radio cannot be compared to an OEM car radio that comes with a vehicle that are renowned for powerful and clear reception. My first choice was an actual OEM radio that I purchased from a salvage yard that cost more than this one but unfortunately I could not defeat the barriers that prevent stand alone operation on batteries that are isolated from the engine battery without handshaking with the vehicle's computer.On the plus side sound is good quality when music is played from a SD chip. Its physical size makes for easy mounting and it has numerous features that are appealing. It seems that this radio will only work properly when installed in a plastic dashboard that does not electrically shield it and a person sitting two feet away is a vital constituent of its operational circuitry.
1,Volume knob quit working after 2 months you get what you pay for apparently. No return and no support. They send you to Some boss website in Australia for all warranty stay away fromm boss decks imo
4,Great stereo easy to install and operate.
5,It was plug and play on a piece of heavy equipment that needed a new radio and it worked perfect!!
3,Équipement fragile faire attention lors de l’installation. Nécessite un support en métal sinon faut bricoler pour le solidifier (appuis en plastique+duct tape. Distorsions si le volume est trop élevé. Pour des besoins de base(radio volume bas à moyen). Acceptable pour le prix. Acheté pour remplacer la radio d’une auto de plus de 15ans.
2,blue tooth  phone not the best
1,the radio broke after one week amazon gave me a hard time when i contacted them said i bought it from the manufacturer and not them not true they sold it they should stand behind it
4,Considerando la relación calidad precio es una muy buena opción el sonido es aceptable y las funciones  básicas las cumple sin problema. puedes recibir y tomar llamadas con Bluetooth recomendable si no tienes mucho presupuesto.
2,No se apaga la luz led y la memoria de las estaciones de radio no se quedan grabadas
1,Terrible sound and very poor quality. Also they want you to pay for shipping on return.
1,installed this radio a month ago and some boutons stopped working allready and every time i try to use my two way radio it interferes with the bluetooth and it keeps calling people this radio is garbage for me
5,Pretty bare-bones unit but it works great to drop into a stock sound system on an older car in order to add bluetooth music and handsfree calling. Can't beat it for the price.
4,Unfortunately this will have to be returned. It blew up the first time it was installed and hooked up! We are not sure if it was just a lemon from factory so we will reorder.
1,I have bought aftermarket installation kit power /speaker  connector for fitting to om  wire harness . I installed it before testing this receiver (big mistake)unfortunately end up Not working at all kept blowing fuse. Had to return it .Hope new one i buy will work .
5,Parfait
5,Parfait
1,Volume disks already broken after 3 drives.
3,Did not install the stereo as I would have had to cut into the stock dash of my 77 Z28 camaro. Therefore I could not provide the requested ratings on the product. However I will state the seller Smaug's Shop was very reasonable and prompt in dealing with my return request. Would rate this seller's customer service as exceptional.
5,Did what it was supposed to do. Easy and simple to use
5,bonne qualité seul inconvénient le display est pas assez lumineux difficile a voir
3,I installed it on a tractor with a main battery shut off switch.  The unit wouldn't put out any sound to the speakers when it is first powered up without pulling the wiring harness to the speakers out and re inserting it.  Then it worked fine  But since it gets a power disconnect when its stored for a while you have to repeat the procedure every time it is fully disconnected from power.
1,
5,I replaced an older and very complicated to use in dash stereo in a motorhome with this one.  I get clearer sound and more channels.  Very easy to use even setting up for bluetooth.  Highly recommended
1,Needed SD card input because USB sticks out too far to close weatherproof lid I added to my boat.
1,Pas de courant  ne fonctionne pas
5,Easy to install and ser up. Great value for the money.
5,Very straight forward install as simple as any single din. Everything worked well.Definitely a good value for the price only complaint is there isn’t much adjustment of sound quality that I’ve found so far. Otherwise sounds and looks better than you’d expect for price
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My original stereo didn’t have any features at all I’m not sure how the previous owner lived with that thing.This radio modernized the entertainment system for this work truck and was very easy to install. (I did buy a 3rd party wire adapter to make it easier but is not required.)Only complaint is that The bracket that came With the unit didn’t fit very snug in my truck but this was easily fixed.
5,Keeps up very well with a pair of Kenwood 450W speakers. Minimal adjustment on the audio on first usage and it does very well! Wiring diagram set up  and instructions are very clear. Would definitely get again!
5,For the price ( 55$ cdn) What a deal lightweight enough power for a boat. Plenty of in/out options.Just Perfect !
4,Installed easily. Found that the tabs to keep the unit from sliding into the dash are on the flimsy side they bent in easily but we're easy to bend back in place. The head unit does have 2 pre-amp outputs but no remote line to tell the amp to turn on.Existing speakers sound much better with this unit than the 25 year old pioneer unit it replaced.Good value but know that you will have to turn your sub amp on with switched ignition power as this unit doesn't have a remote power line.
3,This radio works especially well for listening to Music from disparate regions of the US. It plays music popular with the conservative alt right and the socially minded left. You can use the Bluetooth feature to call your friends who agree with you and to discuss in a rational way what it is that is challenging for your relationships; with respect. Install this unit and restore civility to your community!!!
1,Wasnt bad for price but sound sucks when it’s up all the way
5,Fast shipping sounds great for the price easy to install would definitely buy again
5,Used in travel trailer to replace old Soundstream unit. Bluetooth on old unit would drop connection within 5 feet with this Boss unit I can walk around the entire trailer and it stays connected.Sounds great too
1,Stopped working 2 days after installation. Only volume button works. Reset and hard reset does nothing. Only customer support is "have you tried resetting ? " and that is all they could do . Real waste of time
