4,As a tabletop radio this box is pretty nice. Unfortunately the headphone jack (which is my primary use) is mono so I have to send it back. However if you use it on the speaker the sound quality is quite nice. The volume knob is a bit touchy at low levels but that also is probably not a big deal for most.
5,This one has excellent reception sensitivity as advertised.  SW is 4.7 to 18 MHz.  10 MHz comes in gangbusters if that's what grabs you.  The rest of it is a bit weak but SW she ain't what she used to be; instead it's all on your cell phone now.  Sound quality is almost as good as that of the Panasonic RF-2400D bought here earlier.  It's got a real volume control knob with on/off switch.  You gotta love that!  Much bigger and heavier than the Panasonic but it's not annoyingly big at all.  I tested the current draw on the D cells.  It's 70 µA when the radio is turned off.  That means the life of the D cells is essentially their shelf life.  When the radio is turned on it can be up to 100 mA at which time it becomes way too loud for me!  I like 50 mA better.  Even 100 mA is no strain on D cells.  Check the on-line D cell charts of say Energizer or Duracell for cell life at your current.
4,I wanted a small radio for my kitchen which had good reception for AM stations.  According to the reviews this was just the one I needed.  Am very happy with it received it plugged in the power cord and was able to find the radio station I wanted it came in very clear no static.  I am hoping it continues to perform in this manner.  I would recommend this radio to anyone wanting a small tabletop radio.
5,Love the sound quality and love how the stations that I normally can’t pick up unless I’m in my car this radio however does pick up great fm radio! For all of the stations we listen too they all pick up! Clear too! We live way out in country and service is hard to come by. But this radio is so worth it! It really picks up! Love the antenna it has! It is durable! My 2 year old son turns the knob to find a song he likes and the antenna is not flimsy! A strong antenna.
4,Radio works as promised and has a clear audio quality.  The instructions were clear.  I have not tried the battery operated mode but don't intend to since it was purchased for AC use only
5,Very easy to use. I bought this because it reminds me of the old radios. I wanted to listen to a ball game and that’s all. I use my phone for everything else probably but this is perfect for listening to ball games.
4,Good sound quality with a very touchy tunning knob. Relatively good for pulling in stations about 60 miles away.
4,perfect for the barn. In size and volume. my pets love it and the clock is big enough for my bad eyes
4,I really like this transistor radio But did not realize it was a 24-hour clock. Evidently I didn’t read the description close enough and if I did I would’ve looked for a different radio. The sound is excellent as is the ease to use.
5,I love that it has the LED which makes it easier to find your stations you want.
5,We were looking for a high quality simple to operate radio…. No fancy clock or bells & whistles…just great sound from a non-gargantuan device.
5,Took a chance on this radio being that I needed to finally replace the bigger bulky radio I had had for years. This radio is wonderful! The control knobs are simple to use and I like that the stations are visible in a digital format. Sound is good and this radio is so light-weight! Very pleased with this uncomplicated radio!
4,Overall I am very happy with this radio. The main requirement was strong tuner performance especially in AM/FM reception. From that standpoint this is easily the best of any radio I've got. I use this radio is in a shop environment with it tuned to the same station 99% of the time. I wanted it to provide sound over the ambient noise not expecting it to be heard over power tools. In this respect it works excellent.The station I want to listen to is lower power with several higher strength signals close on the band. The radio I'm replacing would drift between three different stations depending on the weather time of day or whatever. Another radio I tested would only pick up the station with the antenna fully extended & properly positioned. This radio picks up the station without fail even with the antenna fully retracted.That said there are several things to be aware of if your use will be different than mine. - The volume control on my particular unit has almost no low volume control. From OFF to sound takes about 5 dots of motion on the volume knob and at that level its fairly loud possibly too loud for office environments. - The detents on the selector switch for changing frequency bands is very light. I've had no problems with the band changing but its hard sometimes to know if you have made the change except by hearing the audio change. Since I rarely change stations this has no real impact on my usage. - This has a digital tuning display but uses an analog tuner with the knob common to all bands. What this means is that when you tune in an AM station and shift the band to FM you have to turn the knob to tune in the new station which also changes the AM tuning so when you switch back to AM you have to tune that station in again. One effect of this type of tuning is that the digital display may change for a set tuning. For example if I tune in 96.7 and turn off the radio when I power it back on the display may say it is set to 96.8. Fortunately the tuning has not changed so the station still comes in. Another effect of this is that there are no presets available. Since I rarely change stations this has no real impact on my usage. - Removing power for even a few seconds without batteries installed causes loss of clock time. - The frequency stays in place with power removed so you don't have to worry about finding your station again.
4,I was skeptical but it's actually a great little radio. Shortwave doesn't come in well in my garage which is disappointing but not unexpected due to electrical interference. However my local PBS station sounds great.
5,The front where time and station i.d. number are supposed to light up is completely dark. I have to guess what station I have selected.
4,I need to switch between several different AM & FM radio stations depending on where the next sports event is to be broadcast.  I was tired of the imprecision of analog tuning. This radio allows me to turn the digital readout to precisely the frequency I'm looking for. And it is completely accurate. Further the sound is quite satisfactory for my needs. I do not use the shortwave band. I'm not even sure of how much use it is in the USA. My only somewhat negative observation about this radio is that the power cord seems to be in an awkward location.  It is easy when slightly turning the radio to bring in the signal better to have the power cord fall out.  It seems with just a little bit of additional engineering and possibly for a few more cents of production cost they could have solved this. But In the grand scheme of things that is such a very slight concern for me. Before I bought this radio I saw a bunch of negative reviews. I've gone back and reread them after I have the radio in my hand. I am honestly quite confused about why they would write a sour review instead of just sending the radio back because clearly there was a mistake made in that particular unit. Things like "the knob was bashed in"  or "it doesn't receive any stations" clearly can't be representative of the product that everybody else is receiving.
4,My only reason for rating it 4 star was it has a clock that was not needed.  If you turn the radio off without the radio plugged into an outlet the clock will drain the batteries. Should you use the radio only as a portable leave the plug out of the radio.
5,It does what it’s supposed to do.  Picks up hard to reach stations. Is easy to operate.  Like the digital screen.  Has good sound quality.  Much much better than the Panasonic radio I bought from Amazon a year ago.
5,Great sound
4,Listen to it all the time
4,The clear reception of distant radio stations is great. The only complaint is the volume control know is much to sensitive ( a slight touch increases/decreases the volume too much).
5,I just love this radio.  Small size but big/clear sound on AM and FM bands.
5,I needed a radio for my 98 year old father who listens to a local oldies station.  On any other radio we could barely get it to tune in sometimes not at all.  This shortwave radio is perfect.  Actually I'm kind of shocked.  What I love about it is that it's digital so really easy to program to stay on the channel.  It has a nice long antennae but we haven't had to use it it's really lightweight and can be used with or without batteries.  I also like that it's so easy for him to use.  The on/off and volume are all controlled by the same large dial on the front so he doesn't have to mess with any other dials.  It's simple  and the sound is unexpectedly very good.  I would like to see a little longer cord (the one with it is probably about 6 feet) so it will be fine for most people.
5,I live in an area with poor radio signal . Wish it had NOA. other than that great radio. Sound quality is good and reception great.
5,for a cheap radio it has good sound. I use mine for background noise in my brick and motor store. pics up all the channels I like and then some with antenna up
5,I purchased this for my hubby. He has no complaints and he likes that it displays in military time. There is no other option. So if you don’t want to see the military time be displayed this might not be for you.
4,It is great for the garage or outdoor work area but oddly it has no preset buttons.
5,Great radio. Used it for group drive-in movie gathering. Used it to blast volume of movie rather than using car radio.  Sounds was very loud and clear.
4,Stopped working. Would not tune. Digital display was not working. Seller replaced item after contacting. Not a bad radio. Fewer channels than expected. Tuning knob seem a little delicate. Decent sound.
5,I missed having a simple radio like I used to have years ago. It’s perfect!
5,My Mom lives in a very rural area where TV reception can be spotty so she listens to a lot of radio. The one she was using had a lot of static so I tried to find her a better one. THIS ONE IS IT. Not too big not too small yet gets INCREDIBLE reception. Very easy for her to use. Would order again in a heartbeat.
4,Very clear reception on AM and FM.Strong volume available and sound is clear when set high.Playing an AM Station has very little interference.  Other electrical devices does not distort this radio.  That is not the case with a couple of my more expensive Boom Boxes!Haven't used Shortwave so unable to rate that feature.Haven't tested with batteries so unable to rate that feature.Quirks that kept if from 5 Stars:> I listened to my favorite FM Station and then switched to an AM station to check connection.  When I switched back to FM it was no longer set to my favorite FM Station!  I find that inconvenient.> Sometimes its challenging to dial in a new station because its easy to dial past.  I've learned to turn the dial slower once I get close to the desired Station.Even with these quirks I may purchase another one to replace one of those other more expensive Boom Boxes!  So I do recommend you consider purchasing one.
4,I started using it right away but it is not as powerful to pull in channels as I thought it was supposed to be.
4,Well we were looking for a standard AM/FM radio to sit on top of the refrigerator. I previously had some nice Grundig that had nice sound AC/DC function and it had shortwave. (Got this steal at Goodwill for 9.99). Well the Goodwill radio was kaput after awhile it worked then it didn't then I opened it to fix and well it just stopped working. (Wonder why it was at Goodwill) So I am looking for a replacement that had the following requirements.1) Simple functional controls - This radio has that On/Off/Volume; AM/FM/SW (only I use SW not the Mrs.)2) AC/DC function to take outside in the summer - It does but as specified the batteries cannot be installed when plugged into AC.My Review.PROS-The radio does have a pretty decent speaker and sounds good.-Simple functional controls.-Sensitivity seems good - all stations I use locally come in fine-Remembers last station that was tuned when you power on (if you do not switch bands and look around)Cons:-Would like to keep batteries in and still use AC to save batteries. (Does not like this but specs say that is how it works)-I think this is a DSP type Radio (Digital Signal Processing) all good and well but the tuning is super fast. No doubt this is because the SW spans 4-18 MHz and boy can it go quick but difficult to get the right frequency because it has a very high frequency change to knob rotation ratio. (This is also true when tuning FW stations and that can be a bit tricky)-The band switch seems a bit low cost not a real good feel it works I think it may be on the inexpensive type of switch side.Rating it overall as a 4 because it does what it says it does. The price is ok and I am impressed with sound qualityWhat I would improve is:-To have a FAST/SLOW tuning switch so one can get tuned in FM or SW a little easier.-Get down to 1kHz tuning resolution in the SW band (Currently is X.XX MHz meaning 10kHz resolution nice if X.XXX)-Put in circuit that will allow batteries to be in radio (not used) while plugged into AC. (This way when I grab it to take outside I don't need to add that last battery.)-Try to find a better feel band switch.I don't regret this purchase but then again I am kinda picky!
5,Elderly mother
5,When I’m painting or remodeling a room I feel the sound is good quality plus I like the fact it’s digital so I can tune in the stations easier.
4,good
5,Great reception!
5,This radio is like radios of a prior time with the improvement that the tuning dial has been replaced with a digital dial making it easier to quickly tune to the exact frequency.  I like the fact that it uses D cells which last a long time.  Sound quality is very good with good tone although the earphone jack sounds like mono not stereo. But since I don't listen to the radio using the earphone that doesn't concern me.  I like the high/low tone switch.  The radio pulls in distant stations very well.  My only complaint is the few seconds it takes the radio to turn on when it is first switched on not a big deal.
4,This is a good straight forward digital tuning radio but there is one flaw that I must remove one star.Whenever you change from AM/FM or FM/AM the channel you were on is lost.  Meaning you must go back and tune to your previous channel.If you never change from AM/FM then this radio gets full stars.  I did an extensive search and this radio was the lowest cost for a digital tuning radio.  Simple to use with straightforward twist knobs for volume (this also turns it on/off)  Am/FM knob large dial for changing the channel to exactly what you want.  This is the radio you want.
5,If you want a small radio that works properly this is it...
5,Super radio. Finally something worth the money on Amazon
4,I ordered 5 different radios all with digital tuning and this one was by far the best.  It has a nice speaker which produces great sound it has easy controls and is able to tune in to all AM stations unlike some of the other radios and it has a power cord which means I don't have to keep changing batteries.  At around $40 and no presets I think it's overpriced but it's still less expensive than any of the Sangean models and probably of equal quality.  If it were priced at around $20 I would have given it 5 STARS. Also tuning can be a bit tricky because it tends to overshoot but with some patience you can zero in.
5,Easy to tune
3,Well it works and sounds pretty good.  This unit picks up local AM and FM radio stations.  The short-wave section also picks up stations but exhibits interference from out of band signals which is strange because we have few if any strong signals that would cause such problems.  This radio is easy to operate.  I note that the frequency counter (the digits on the front panel that attempts to show you the frequency the radio is tuned to) is not very accurate.  For example when listening to a local station on 730 AM when the station is properly tuned in/sounds best the digital readout says 732.  I noticed the same thing on FM where 95.3 sounds better when tuned to 95.4.This radio is advertised as a "DSP" radio.  I'm sure it is but it sure is a cheap/faulty implementation of digital signal processing.  Case in point is seen when trying to listen to weak stations.  When trying to listen to a station on 800 KHz this radio involuntarily shifts between two or three competing signals.  I can't tell whether these are on adjacent frequencies (like 790 and 810) or the radio is gathering samples from multiple signals on the same frequency.  My read is that this radio uses a very poor DSP chip.  It would have been far better to use a more conventional superheterodyne circuit although that might cost more to implement these days.Would I buy this radio again? No!  Should you buy it probably but it's really not a great bargain.  I notice other radios without the digital readout for $10 less.  They'd probably work just as good.
5,Friendly fast and good comunication
5,Me gusto.
5,The speaker is clear and the sound is wonderful for such a small radio.  Great buy for the dollars.
5,I could not be more pleased great price. Reception. I purchased 2 and then purchased 2 more great items. Thank you!
3,There is a local jazz station about 15 miles away from my home and this radio is incapable of receiving/playing it. I specifically but it to listen to this jazz station outside so that is a drag. It came in perfect condition and fast due to Prime.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The Greadio MD-T26 is a really well built general coverage shortwave radio.FM selectivity and sensitivity are fine for local stations but it did not receive a weak station between two stronger FM stations. Good job receiving locals though. Sound is very good.It picked up the Shortwave stations I am used to receiving very well. Tuning knob allows me to quickly surf the shortwave band what I like about it best!It has a headphone jack built in AC power transformer and fold down handle. Also can use 3 D size batteries. No lighted dial tuning indicator or power indicator.AM reception works just fine for me.I’m happy and would recommend getting this radio. Greadio really came up with something nice here if your expectations are in line with price.
5,This is just what I wanted
5,Excellent reception and overall product.
5,Got this for my (aging) wife who fights with her "antique" radios to listen to ball games decided she needed a digital tuner. She likes it and it solved the problem of her having to fish for the right station.
5,Have tried several. Live in rural area power goes out sometimes. This has good reception like the digital dial goes right to your stations.
5,After struggling with an old analog boombox that just barely pulled in my favorite radio station if I arranged the power cord and whip antenna just right and didn't stand too far away from it I finally bit the bullet and decided to buy a new radio.  I am so glad I did and I can't believe it took me so long.  The one feature that I really wanted and that this radio has is the digital station readout on the front screen.  I know that the tuning is not really digital but that is not important.  I just needed to see the numbers on the front of the box so that way I don't have to guess where the little line is positioned and guess what radio station it might possibly be tuned to.  I have had more than enough of that.  My big concern was whether it would be able to pull in my favorite low-power radio station inside my metal workshop building.  Well it sure does.  More than enough.  Excellent sound quality plenty of volume.  Very pleased.  Highly recommended.
5,Tone and volumes choices make this a great radio.
5,If you are looking for a radio to use at the drive-in movies instead of keeping your vehicle in accessory mode this is the one!  This little radio has great sound and very easy to tune in.  It also comes with a clock which is in 24 hour time.  Some may not like that if they do not know how to convert to "military time" as I call it.  I have a Chevy Equinox and it fits perfectly on top of my dash and is still out of the way so you can watch the movie.  All around great item...glad I purchased it!
3,Display already out. Of course return to Amazon already over. Hard to tune when you don’t know where on the dial you at.
3,Good reception and tuning BUT the display fades after a few weeks and is barely visible.Seller gave me the run around
3,The radio is okay I guess.  The only issues I have is that I put in the batteries and within 4 months of nonuse the batteries were used up.  The only thing I can see is that the clock dots between the hour and minutes constantly flashes and drains the batteries.  I could never get the dots to stop flashing.  There is an earphone jack opening but no earphones included in the purchase and the text description led me to believe they were included.  The third issue is to contact the seller you have to use Facebook.  There is no other way offered to contact them.  The return window is now closed or I would be sending the purchase back.
3,good radio  great controls display went out in the first day of use.
4,wish radio had more volume or an additional speaker
5,Good reception
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I listen to WBAL and WWEA frequently on my Greadio.  It's a wonderful product.
5,Perfect for the bathroom window sill where we keep it. Sounds decent for the price. Easy to use
3,I like the look of it. But the quality of the sound is not like some of the reviews say.
5,Bought for my husband. He loves it. Sits on the patio & listens to the news! He’s hard of hearing & doesn’t have a problem hearing. Easy controls!
4,wonderful radio for seniors  easy to setup and use.
3,This radio does not have a digital tuner. This was my mistake by looking at the picture of this radio. It has an analogue (old style) tuner with a simulated digital display. The radio however seems to be good quality. I will probably keep the radio I am still trying to decide. The clock is a 24 hour display only. It does not display in a 12hr format.
5,We keep a radio in our bathroom to listen to while we’re getting ready.  This one is perfect!  I love that it has a digital dial so you can tell exactly what channel you’re on instead of the tiny bars out old one had.  Makes it so much easier to find the right station!  Sound quality is good also.
5,Lo recomiendo
4,Radio pickups a lot of stations but the shortwave radio doesn't pick up very many at least so far. When I get some batteries for it I will try it again cuz sometimes electronic interference causes you not to get a good signal. Still cause I would recommend it for the AM radio alone.
4,All about it.  Sound clarity of pickup stations much better than dial tuner
5,i purchase this radio for my mother who lives in close to the border in Mexico and the reception is great. she loves it  get many channels
3,It does-Not Receive NPR  89.7
5,Last week we had a terrific storm with tornado warnings in our area. We were all advised to go to the underground garage for a storm shelter.  I had just gotten this radio and had it in my "go bag"as I knew the wicked weather was coming. I was skeptical because car radios and cell phones have a hard time picking up down there. But this little radio was a clear as could be on an AM station! I really appreciated being in a safe place under a lot of concrete but still be able to connect to the outside world.
5,I was afraid to buy this radio because we have terrible radio reception. But when I tuned to my favorite station I heard it loud and clear! The big knob in front makes turning the sound up or down very easy. I like the digital display so I can tell what station I'm on without having to guess as I'm turning the knob back and forth. I keep the radio plugged in all day and listen to my music without static or the sound going in and out.  I would like the radio to have a more decorative look but I'm just glad it has good sound.
5,Love my new radio. I keep it in the kitchen & keep up with the news & music while preparing our meals.
4,Works very well
4,This was a purchase made with my Amazon gift card and for the price it is a decent radio for AM and FM reception.  The tuning step on shortwave was a bit too wide and therefore it is easy to miss a station unless it has a strong signal or you make small tuning adjustments with the knob. I am a ham radio operator and love listening to SW so the performance on that aspect of this radio was a bit disappointing. Otherwise a great portable radio to have around.
4,Quit working after 3 months .  NEVER DROPPED!  XXXXXXX
3,I had an analog radio and the frequency would drift out all the time so wanted a small cheap AM/FM digital replacement.  Not sure this was the answer?  Appears "digital" but doesn't truly lock onto a frequency like a true digital radio.  It acts like an analog even though it has a digital display.  Music comes in (poorly) even when you are slightly off frequency.  it's so small and light it doesn't stay upright on it's own needs a better foot print?  Haven't even played with the shortwave yet.
4,Like the simple controls   24 hr. Clock only though  Sound isn’t great but it’s not a stereo
5,Easy to use
5,My mom wanted something for her job that she didn’t need to connect her phone to so it wouldn’t lose battery so often. She Carrie’s her radio all round her job and loves it. She likes being able to change the stations and sound without needing to use her cellphone.
5,So far the Greadio SW radio is working well for my needs. I wanted a wall power radio for my desk. I haven’t tested it with batteries yet. The on/off volume control and tuner knobs have a quality feel to them. It seems like an analog tuner with a digital display. In other words I don’t believe it’s a true digital tuner. The read out is large making it good for anyone with impaired vision. The display is not back lit. It’s mono not stereo when using the headphone jack. It has good volume and sounds pretty good. I didn’t buy it for a serious SW radio but there are some stations I’m able to pick up. 24 hour clock only.
3,I got this because reviews said it got reception when others didn't. It sort of does but I have to run around the house to get the station I wanted. So far I've been able to get the station but there's a lot of static. It's for baseball games that I can't watch because they're on premium streaming services. So even with static I can deal with it. Not nearly as good as the Bose others have but I can't afford that one.
4,Has good sound/volume. Needs preselect buttons for favorite stations. I don’t care for military 24 hour time. I have to deduct 12 hours every time I look at time
4,This does the job. The volume goes on kind of loud right away. Not a big issue. No preset buttons but easy to locate stations.  Nice for the purpose of talk radio or listening to music.
4,I bought this to replace a small Grundig about 15 years old that I kept in the bath room.  Used 4 AA rechargeable. I it finally died when I dropped on the hard floor.  I mostly listen to FM 90.9 and 91.3.  Unlike the Grundig this one does an easy job of separating and finding both.  But the volume control!  Between blasting too loud with my hearing aid off and hearing nothing even with my hearing aid turned up is a very small twitch on the volume control. I also am wondering about the safety in the bathroom.  Currently I am using the AC power cord in a ground interrupt safety outlet.The instruction sheet says to use it on battery only in emergency and leave the batteries out when the machine is turned off or on AC.  Perhaps this is written on instructions from their liability lawyer. but I have used it only on AC.
3,Digital display quit working after only 2-3 weeks of use.
5,I have several radios and all are digital tuning.  The issue i had with previous radios is that they were somewhat complicated to use; just too many buttons to remember how to get back to a station.  This radio is very simple to use with only three basic controls - on/off/volume AM/FM/SW and tunning.  I mostly use the FM so i set it up for that mode and then only have to work with two controls- volume and tunning.  The large speaker gives good quality sound.  Two other great features:  A clock and use of D size batteries.  Although the D size batteries make the unit heavier the added extra battery capacity allows for a long service time.  I am 81 and this radio is great and easy to use.
3,Frequency knob is not working properly cannot search the whole spectrum
4,Excellent radio
4,Overall this product is good value for money and the sound quality is good. FM reception sensitivity was also good.The most disappointing thing is that it is not 100-220V Free input voltage. What I would like to improve is that when the FM station is synchronized the synchronization signal LED lamp is turned on.Another thing is that using a large-capacity rechargeable lithium-ion battery will greatly increase convenience. After purchasing the item I changed it to a system that can be charged using 2 26650 Li-ion  batteries.
5,I purchase this radio for a blind friend and he love it.
5,No complaints
5,Only the buttons I need. Had to return several radios that were too complicated. Just what I wanted!
5,Great sound. Good quality. Ease of operation and mostly able to get AM Especially FM with great sound. Other FM Radios I have have poor reception.
4,We needed a modern radio for our kitchen so we could receive all the current stations.  This simple light radio fills our needs quite handsomely.  My only complaint would be the tuning mechanism must be analog even though it has a digital display. I know this since when you switch from AM to PM you aren't at the same place when you were last on that band  Therefore you have to retune the station each time you switch. A possible annoyance for some but for a hands-on guy like me no real problem.
4,Radio functions well good reception nice appearance. Recommend purchasing an extended warranty on all things electronic.
4,I am completely pleased with this radio although I have not even tried the Shortwave or AM feature.  I use it in my kitchen where I just want a little music without blasting the entire house.Seems that my kitchen is in a "no- reception" zone.  Not with this radio!  It receives a strong clear signal even with the most "iffy" FM stations.  There are two sound settings low and high.  The sound quality is not the greatest as in it does not offer a "mega bass" for a more richer sound but I am just happy that I can get a solid station.  This is the ONLY reason that I gave it the rating that I did. Otherwise I am very happy with my purchase.
5,The reception is outstanding. I receive all my favorite FM stations.
4,Sometimes NPR on 901 or 2 the sound is not sharp and disturbed by another noise.
4,Honestly this radio is really good for AM and FM radio. The sound quality is adequate for listening to radio especially talk radio. It's okay for music. It's not great for shortwave. To be clear it will receive shortwave signals but the antenna is not adequate to pick up many channels well. I wish there was a place to plug in an external antenna. Other than that it's a really good basic radio for someone who wants something to listen to around the house or while working. I would recommend purchasing unless you are primarily buying this for shortwave. If so keep looking.
5,A 90+year-old can use this radio because it can be operated using just 2 rotary switches and tuning dial. The display is large and clearly displays the frequency and time but it isn't backlit. The sound is loud and clear and gets very little interference so it gives a new life to AM and SW listening even indoors. It comes with a cord for 120V and can also be battery powered (but it retains and displays the time for a little while even if no power or batteries are installed so no need to set the time during short power outages). The radio is very compact and lightweight.
5,Wow!  I have a Sony surround sound system with all the expensive components that can't get an AM station at all.  This little gem picks up the Seattle Mariner game on 710 am like u are in the ballpark!  Too bad Direct TV wont show the games but I can hear them!
5,Great product. Rapid shipment.
3,At first I liked it. It got reception good. The sound was good. Now I get nothing. So a waste of money. I should of paid more attention to the reviews
4,needs 12 and 24 hour time not just military time.
4,I wish it had a remote
4,Nice little radio... does its job. Super easy to use. Love the retro look and big digital screen combo.
5,Is compact yet yields excellent sound
5,Like it easy to use
4,Large enough speaker for volume and not too large.
4,Likes for this radio. 1. Large display. 2. Large dials for tuning and volume control. 3. Built in power supply for use in kitchen  dining room study workshop or garage. 4. Takes 4 d batteries these would last a long time for a camping trip or where an electrical outletWasn't available.Dislikes for this radio. 1. I would have expected better audio quality from the speaker in this radio. It is adequate for talk radio. The size should have better audio range lacking adequate bass response and treble response for orchestra or classical music. The toneAdjust should fully adjustable instead of a high low switch.I purchased this radio for my mother-in-law because of large display large knobs for tuning and volume. I feel the tonal qualityShould be adequate to meet her needs.
5,Well made. Big digital readout. VERY STRONG reception. I get WGBH from Over 90 miles away. Long battery life. Comes with AC cord internal transformer. AM reception better than expected actually quits good. Clock keeps accurate time but only reads 24 hour time. This radio is a gem and a great value for yourself or as a gift.
5,Excelente producto
5,I am VERY Pleased
5,We wanted a digital radio for use in the house and we upgraded from analog to digital. Quite a difference and this one has great sound. We normally just listen to Talk Radio so not sure how great the sound is with FM music station but sure it is as good as talk radio....
4,The AC power cord to radio was too large and wouldn't remain connected so it was whittled down. Then too whoever heard of UM-1 batteries?
5,This is a great little radio to listen to my Giants while at work. There is a bit of interference possibly due to our CNC machines and the heavy warehouse construction but the sound is pretty good overall.
3,Radio is not too bad but not able to pick up channels well where I live. Probaably not the radios fault.
4,The digital readout is clear and the tuning knob is pretty precise.
5,The short wave is not very good but otherwise is great.
5,This is my 5th battery Radio. The last were more expensive and did not sound close to this radio. The feature  that is not found in all the other radios I have owned is a clock. It is a super idea. It's the best I have owned. It's so great I buying the same radio again to save for future use.
5,Plug it in the wall or use batteries like it
5,Worth the money.
4,Have to remove power cord from radio to get it To work using batteries??  Means if you have power failure have to remove cord to use. Instructions says to remove batteries if using 110 power. Weird!!  Otherwise works ok
4,The sound control is sensitive a little turn makes a big change in volume.  A few memory buttons for switching favorite stations would be nice.  I use it in the bathroom and it works great for sound quality.I would prefer a 12 hour clock vs the 24 hour clock provided.  The appearance is nice.  I have ported it to places without an outlet and it works perfectly on batteries.
5,I love it  it is for if the tv goes off I can listen to the news
1,Overall I like the radio. But there’s one major product flaw: The warranty contact information seems to be a major secret. Let's do a close review of potential warranty contact options:1—On the Amazon webpage when you select the warranty information option you get the following response: “Please contact the seller directly for warranty information for this product. You may also be able to find warranty information on the manufacturer’s website.” (But see below on how that suggest will work).2—When the radio arrived the product box had ZERO contact information displayed: No webpage listing no address no phone number no email address no fax number no recommended carrier pigeon route etc. It’s a total ZERO. Not even the company name of “Greadio” appears on the box. I have to wonder if the product or the company is in some type of witness protection program.3—As for the actual radio once again there is ZERO contact information. And the “Greadio” name is again missing.4—The 1-page miniature print user manual is a complete dead end. The user manual does state “this am fm sw radio has full 12-month warranty against manufacturing defects [sic] .” However yet again there is ZERO contact information for how to seek warranty support and the “Greadio” name is completely absent from the 1-page miniature user sheet.5— For one last good faith effort I searched the radio’s Amazon webpage. I noted that radio is listed as “Sold By GagaBlue” ---- When you hit the GagaBlue link a Chinese postal address is listed but zero contemporary electronic contact information.Amazon should suspend sales of this product until “Greadio” is fully transparent with its contact information to honor warranty support if needed. And if “Greadio” is such a great company and brand it should be proudly placing its name on every aspect of the product: the box the radio the user manual etc.
5,The radio has exceeded my expatiation. I am well satisfied. It pulls in the stations very well they come in strong
5,Good speaker
5,Very good FM and AM reception - better FM than I got with more expensive radios.  Five minutes to set up.  Only downside is no station presets but given the price a good deal.  Speaker quality for this price is also very good.
3,I bought it because it was digital if you listen to an AM station and then flip it to FM and turn the dial you can't keep the AM station where you last had it so every time you flip back and forth you have to adjust the dial what a bummer even Weather Channel every time you move the dial or whichever band when you go back you have to relocate
3,As a basic radio one doesn’t expect too much. That said why can’t this remember the stations tuned by band. (AM vs FM). Having to tune into a station each time you switch from one band to the next is just dumb when the radio could remember the setting. It does when switched from on to off so the function is there. The other shortfall on function is the tuning. It doesn’t seem to be a digital tuner. I say this because when tuning the device there is a good amount of frequency play around a given station. This shouldn’t happen if the tuner was truly digital.Overall a decent radio for what one can expect at this price point. There are better possibilities. This was a gift to an elderly person who needs simplicity in function. This will mostly fit that bill as long as he stays on one band.I wouldn’t recommend this to a technically proficient person they would frustrate with it quickly.
4,I’m pleased.Decent sized portable radio with handle. Long power cord. The low/high tone feature is nice. Sound quality is ok. The on/off/volume dial is large & taught movement. Tuner is analog (not digital) with large LED readout. I use in bedroom for AM mostly (baseball) & signal drifts slightly but retuning is quick. Take note that the time is in military time format (24 hour).For the money spent it was well worth it to me. I recommend.
5,I just got my radio today and I haven't turned it off since.  It's awesome!  The set up was super easy... love the big screen that shows the time when it's turned off and shows the radio station when it's on.  The sound is fantastic.... I have it in the other room and I can hear it as if it was beside me.  I highly recommend this radio for size sound quality easy to use and features.  Get it you won't be disappointed.
4,Era lo que me intesaba. Gracias
4,Compacted unit...easy to dial...but speaker could be a bit better
5,Was trying to get reception for my mom in a retirement home.  Other radios didn't cut it.  This one brought the stations in perfectly.  Highly recommend.
5,Radio and music with alarm
5,Controls easy to use
5,it pulls in AM  and FM stations better than i hoped for.  i get stations I never got before  especially AM which is usually the weakest feature on these radios.  it hangs in my shop and is unaffected by my drill press and grinders on the same circuit or my LED shop lights.  Admit i haven't tested it while using my MiG welder.....
5,you will not find a receiver as good as this without spending a lot more money!
5,It actually has a digital clock with big numbers! I didn't expect that but it's great. I put mine on the wall under a hanging cabinet and the AM sound is clear and tuneable. I do wish the antenna was longer but on well. I'm in a basement and want to listen to baseball games at work- it's perfect. I'll try a grounded antenna for FM but i'm not too worried about it. Good value.
5,Good reception works like an inexpensive radio should. Sound is good. Not JBL or Bose quality but not bad at all. I’d buy again.
5,listening to music with no static or losing radio station
5,I bought this to listen to my am 61 sports channel and it works great.
5,I use it in my bathroom.  It is easy to turn on but takes a few seconds to respond before I can adjust the volume.  The sound is good.  The clock is 24 hour only.
5,We had one radio that was a bust in picking up a radio station 15 miles away. This one does it clearly without even deploying the antenna. Great sound quality. The LED station number indicator is an additional plus. So is the tone knob.
5,We live in an area where we get storms that take out internet access and electricity a lot. Sometimes radio and TV reception is poor also. This radio has great reception and is very easy for senior citizens to use.
3,I bought this for my garage so I could listen to music while I am tinkering.  Works great for AM and FM reception; however  I could not pull in any shortwave stations  I could hear a AM station broadcasting a foot ball game constantly while trying to tune the shortwave.
5,So easy to use no instructions needed simple just add batteries and go. The sound is fantastic too. I bought this for emergency use but it is so good I am using it all the time!
5,The radio was a gift for a friend who cannot afford cable tv.she had no source of entertainment and had been wanting a radio but could not afford to buy one. I surprised her with this one. We do not live in the same states so I have not been able to see it. She says it is  wonderful and has a lot of different stations that come in nicely. I have not hears yet if the batteries came in yet. I believe I also ordered batteries so that she can take it with her when she goes out for picnics. She is delighted with her new radio.
5,I have tried 3 radios to listen to in my garage while working on my cars or other.  This is the best.  Good reception good volume.
5,I am very happy with this radio.  I am using it in my kitchen.  The reception is very good and the digital tuneing is so easy to use.
4,My biggest complaint is difficulty in tuning to station. The tuning dial is way to sensitive. Just the slightest movement will carry past desired station. It should have a fine tuning knob or at least some pre-set buttons.
4,For the most part I do like this radio. But I don't like that it uses "military time".
5,Very happy with this radio it’s set up old school. Just turn the knob to turn on and off. Turn the other knob for Am/Fm.
3,How  would you like to  have a radio where you can't see the stations or the time?  If so this is your dream.This would be a five-star rating if not for that ridiculous flaw.  Though few if any reviewers mention it the LCD readout is not backlit.  Impossible to see at  night.  Every other device I have is backlit.  Computer stereo cable box anything!  But not this.  I thought I had gotten a defective unit because I couldn't believe it was designed this way.  But it was.Pity.  Because it's an old man easy-as-pie radio to operate.  Sound is excellent.
5,This radio is well made. I am very happy with this purchase.
4,If your looking for a simple quality radio for general use this is the one. Well constructed ease of finding your desired station through a digital tuner and ample sound quality.  Reception is good and well defined for both am and fm.  Have not really used the short wave function too much to rate.  The one thing that may detract for some users is the clock function it only displays 24 hours function but not a big deal to me.
4,Overall i'm very pleased with  this radio.
5,This is exactly what I hoped for. Easy to use without all kinds of buttons that are not user friendly requiring an instruction manual to operate. Turn the dial and it is on. Easy to find stations and sounds good.
5,My wife likes to listen to the radio when she exercises. We have 3 Sony ICF-38 portables which were  considered high-end when we bought them many years ago. This Greadio is much better. There are many things I like about it. The sensitivity and sound quality are all you could expect from a portable. The controls are well thought out and easy to use. Most importantly the digital tuner is great.There are some features I don't need (clock and shortwave band) but everything I want is there.
5,Happy with it.  Has a good sound with a powerful signal not like the other radio I choose before.
5,With other radios I had trouble getting any stations at work. This radio has fantastic reception and all the features are very easy to use. I like that big digital time but I wish that I could have a 12 hour clock instead of the 24 hour. It's small enough that it fits perfectly on a bookshelf and I like the look of it.
5,I liked it so much I am going to order another
1,This is a great little radio--until it suddenly stops working.  The first radio performed beautifully for 6-7 months and then one day for no apparent reason it stopped working.  I thought it was a fluke so I ordered the same radio again because the reception was so good.  The next radio lasted for three days.  Then it just wouldn't turn on the morning of the fourth day.  Again I don't know why it stopped working.  All of the other electrical stuff in my kitchen (and house) was fine. Needless to say I'm not ordering this radio again even though the reception is sharp and clear--until it isn't.
5,This was a gift for my husband. He picked it out for himself and told myself & our daughter about it.  We surprised him Christmas morning. He was really very excited & happy he got it.
3,Just doesn't reach all the stations we once listened to.
5,I wanted a radio that was small and compact for carrier around the house (battery operated) but could also plug into the wall if necessary. The dials on this radio are easy to see and operate.
3,Not very good reception even with the antenna all the way out. Very dissapointed.
5,Not pleased with the Time Accuracy. It does not keep correct time since day one......is now showing nearly a 4 HOUR discrepancy.
4,I don't like the fact that this radio only displays the time in the 24 hour mode. I did not know this when I made my purchase .
4,For use at work
5,This was a great present
4,My husband says “I like the size and the sound of the radio. The volume doesn’t increase/decrease smoothly—It jumps in volume when you turn it only slightly so it’s a little touchy. Overall for the reasonable price it’s doing exactly what I want it to do which is listening to baseball games outside in the summer!”
5,I had doubts but it was for my girlfriend because she listens to the radio every morning when she gets ready. She said all others suck because the reception in the bathroom is always awful. Well not this one! It’s it perfect and sounds great! And she thinks the little old school look of it is so cute (her words! Lol)
5,Very nice radio. Perfect size. Father likes it
5,Nothing to dislike on this radio
3,I am unable to get good reception on this radio
4,This is a great small radio with nice sound and an excellent telescoping antenna. The one minor issue is that the tuning knob is *really* sensitive. It takes tiny adjustments back and forth to get it to the right frequency. It's an overall great radio though - just be aware that the tuning knob is sensitive.
5,La calidad
4,emergency use.
2,I got this on Nov 2 and was glad because then I would be able to listen to Christmas music that was playing on the local buffalo station. I noticed sometimes that I would get small amounts of static but I expected that since its a frequency radio. anyways I walk into my dorm today (I keep it on AND plugged in) and notice that only static is playing but its way louder and consistent this time. I flip through other stations to make sure that its working and it was for SOME stations. I moved the antenna in every position played with the tones and plugged the cord in and out and out was still playing static. I go to unplug the cord one more time and I hear a POP and smell something like burnt plastic. needless to say that its now broken........ on Nov 17............ 2 WEEKS AFTER I GOT IT.
5,Good portable radio doesn’t pickup a lot of stations but I think it where I live a big distance from stations. SW is non is non existent probably just to far away. I do love the stations I receive I leave it on most oft the Tim 24/7.
3,Volume did not work. Had to hold it up to your ear to hear it at all.  Sounds nice and clear but just won’t adjust to higher level.
5,It's a great radio great sound
4,Convenient and portable but lacks internal storage space for A/C power cord. Radio has static when in presence of LED power dimmers. (light dimmers on switch).  Ron
5,Purchased the radio because of the 5 day power cut earlier this year. Felt isolated with no news or info. Also purchased a propane fueled generator. Never again will we rely on distributors.
5,I bought this radio so I could receive info during our many weather situations here in Florida.  So far as I can tell this is one of the perfect radios to do that. It has powerful electronics and seems to pull in radio stations at least 100 miles or more away from my home town.  Would highly recommend this radio to all my friends and would certainly would buy it again.  CHECK THIS ONE OUT..!!
5,We live in a rural area.  Radio reception can be poor as our very modern home has metal siding.  Both AM and FM reception is especially poor in our lower level which is a walkout with 2  sides open.  This radio gets excellent reception in the entire house including the walkout.  It is easy to use and has digital tuning.  It has a short wave band as well though that was not a consideration in our decision to purchase.
5,I am very pleased with the radio.  The sound is excellent with no static.  I like the digital display which is easy to set.  The radio is great.  I need a portable radio with D cells which this is for longer lasting portable use in my sauna.  It’s the perfect size light nice handle nice antenna and the sound quality is great.  I think for the money it is a great value.  I hope it lasts for a long time.  So far I am very pleased with the purchase.
1,This radio is… terrible.  I bought it to use at work and there is no way to have the radio on at a “quiet” volume.  Station tuner goes in and out after being set on a radio station so lots of static while listening to my favorite station and no adjusting to the tuner fixes the problem.  Display is so bad you can’t even see the station # you are tuned on. (See picture where power button is red so the radio is on and nothing is visible on display.)  Basically just a Chinese made piece of crap!Update:  Clock doesn't hold time while plugged in using the AC power cord provided.  I am fine that it displays in military time but I am not fine with the fact that it loses about 2 hours each night.  What good is a clock that I have to reset the time on every morning?  Additionally I now cannot get any radio station to stay tuned without an insane amount of static even with the volume blaring.  It works perfectly fine for the first 20/30 seconds after being turned on and then immediately goes to static.  I have tried tuning to five different stations across the FM band and the issue is consistent with all of the stations.
4,easy to use for a mentally challenged person. volume knob is faulty one this unit.
5,Wanted a radio for garage and for when the power goes out.  This radio fits the bill and has good sound too.
3,The reception is poor.
3,Ok for basic needs. Channel output depends on your location.
5,A little difficult to get lower volume. But it’s doing the work!
5,I bought this as a Father’s Day gift and my dad loves it so much he had be order another one for his friend. He says it’s given him life in a depressing world. He listens to it for hours everyday and is still on the first installation of batteries. It’s the perfect size and puts out a good Sound even on AM.
5,A little weak on th s w
5,I am pleased with my purchase: I ordered this radio and it came sooner than expected: The radio came protected in the package: I plugged and begin listening to after I went through the different stations: the sound is incredibly clear. This radio is a good product for the price! I am delighted that I purchased it and it recommended this product to anyone who is in search of a good-sized quality AM/FM Short wave radio: Great product for your money
2,I hoped this would pick up a station that I easily listen to in my car when I'm in my driveway. It won't get it at all. It's another device with a poor digital tuner.
5,This is everything you need in an emergency radio.  It covers all the bands is easy to tune and has decent sound.
5,Taking radio to the garden .Radio uses  D batteries
4,Sound is good fm is good am and shortwave need improvements.
5,This radio gets good reception and has clear sound.  Be prepared for manual tuning as it does not have presets for stations.  I knew that going in so I was not surprised.  With its antenna extended it gets better reception than a radio I had in it's place that used the power cord for an antenna. It's a good basic radio.
5,Easy to use digital tuning.Clear stations without using the antenna most times.
5,It's exactly what I wanted. It does use the larger batteries which are more expensive but it came with two sets which I appreciate. Also it has a USB charger.
4,I have not used it a great deal so far but happy right now.
4,Radio plays OK.
5,excellent product
5,Great upfront radio. I wish the reseller would take the "elder" phrasing off the description; I'm in my mid-'40s and enjoy it. Not everyone is obsessed with the current "tech".The only real complaint is that the clock seems to only be in 24hr format; there is no AM/PM option. If it's 6:30pm you see 18:30; no way around that.
5,Good product fair price...
5,Bought for my father he loves the digital display do he can easily find his channels and not struggling to get it just right on station.  So he’s been listening to it and using it everyday it’s still works.
5,Great Product
4,I bought 2 one for home and one for our camper. Have enjoyed using both. They seem to be as advertised (though I am no expert).
5,We love everything about it!
5,Reception is good  although I have not tried the shortwave function .
3,Would not buy again. Sound distorts and scratchy at time.
3,The biggest drawback I find with this radio is the lack for a storage place for the A/C cord.
5,I was pleasantly surprised and very pleased with this radio The sound is clear and the reception is great. The reception is actually better than a more expensive radio that I had before getting this one. The large handle also makes it very easy to transport. I don't often give a 5 star rating to any product but this is one of the best I have had.
4,Good radio for home great sound good volume control and easy to use good price for the money
3,If you don’t know military time the clock is no use to you
3,IF I HAD KNOWN THE CLOCK WAS STRICTLY A 24 HOUR CYCLE I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED.  I HAVE REPEATEDLY HAD TO RECENT IT SINCE IT SEEMS TO SWITCH FROM THE AM TO PM CYCLE.
4,Perfect size for the area I wanted . Sounds nice and clear. easy to use.
5,This radio is compact light handsome & works very well. I use this radio when I work out in the garage & also on batteries when I take it out in the yard when I have yard work to do. It is very handy as a portable unit & to be able to plug into an outlet whenever one is available  is nice also.
1,Decent sounding radio considering it’s size my issue with the radio is that the clock functions 24 hour display has started showing garbage after hour 19 of course this started after amazons return period.Radio functions have starting requiring the batteries to be removed and reinserted in order regain tuner function.  I’m very disappointed with the quality of the product.
5,Like it overall.
2,All options on the are fine however I purchased it so that my dad could listen to channels 102.3 FM this radio will not go pass 108. I'm returning both of them.
5,I first bought a very good radio but when I would try to locate my favorite FM station it was quite difficult.  This radio is so much easier to tune because you can see with precision (digitally) your station as you're moving the dial.  In addition it has the private listening feature --- another plus over the 1st radio.
5,Good sound easy to dial good volume control
4,It has great reception.  Just wish I would not have to remove the batteries each time.
5,I bought this radio to use in our barn.  I have tried several radios and this is the first one that picks up a station and holds it.  No static no going in and out and this is without the antenna being up.  The volumn is also much better than other radios i have tried.
4,Works great
3,There was nothing that I disliked about the radio. The quality and sound is very good and clear. I would truly recommend this product to anyone who loves music or wants to know what is going on in their community.
1,Terrible quality died after a few months of use.  First the LCD screen went now it’s dead.  This radio sat on a night stand not even a scratch on it.  Not like a car where it gets beaten up.  Just lousy built quality.
5,Easy to operate and the sound is not cheap !!
3,Radio (FM) works well.  Easy to set up and tune.However 12 month warranty is essentially useless as there is no company contact information on the insert or the box.
1,Not worth buying. Doesn't work. Not happy at all. I don't have time to mess with the return as I am a caregiver. I shouldn't have to worry about it anyway. These should have been checked by quality before being sent. Will not buy again
3,Clock is 24 hour mode ONLY.  No 12 hour mode available. So if you don't want military time don't buy it.Radio frequency dial is not very sensitive.  Make its more difficult to dial a station than it should be.Sound is good for a single speaker though it will not fill up a room if that is what you want.So it is probably worth the price you will pay if you don't mind the drawbacks.
4,Nice radio but difficult to pick up ant shortwave radio stations
3,Hard to tune
5,Todo muy bien 👍
5,Great sound!
4,Good frequency discrimination holds the station well. Not the greatest sounds if you're looking for fine music listeningbut good for talk radio or jobsite use
5,As advertised
5,Great radio recommend
4,So far I am happy with it.
5,I am using this to listen to the AM channels I no longer have to sit in my car to listen to the radio channel. The radio was delivered everything that I need.  Highly recommended.  One thing I hope it make in U.S.A. to support American jobs. I don't think it does.
5,I bought this for my Dad for Father’s Day! He loved it! He listens to his favorite country station! He doesn’t like the new technology! It was the perfect gift! It’s a perfect size to take anywhere! I might get one for myself! Totally worth the money!
3,When you switch bands there is no memory stored for your last setting.
1,Receive the radio and the LED screen Went real them immediately. To where I cannot even know what station I’m tuning into. Now it brings in stations but after 10 minutes from turning it on  it will not pick up any stations AM and FM.  Sometimes go completely silent.  You have to turn it off for a while then turn it back in but again after 10 minutes it’s not working again.  I don’t recommend this radio even at this price.
2,Time setting does not work.  I'm sorry that I missed the return window for this radio.
5,Awesome
5,It's hard to find a fine radio these days. This radio has great reception and is easy to take in the car. It's my MLB ball game radio!
5,For listening music news!
5,Easy to use. Good price. Highly reccomend.
4,not bad for the price. works pretty good.  hard to get battery cover off.
4,the radio works well so far.
1,Of course its easy to use just turn a dial or knob. Problem is thats all it'll do well. LCD display quit displaying after a week so you have no idea where to tune. Few days after that 'best reception' quit picking up most stations just a bunch of static no matter if AM or FM. Save your money or try another brand.
3,The volume of the radio is good but the correct station does not show on the dial.  For instance 1120 am shows as 1119 or 1121 but not 1120.
2,Radio buzzes constantly even when off. If I push or put a weight on it it will stop.
4,Fits in small space in my bathroom. Easy to use and has nice long cord to plug in the wall.
4,Nice radio
2,I bought and used this radio only about 6 times since purchasing it and only listened to fm stations. Yesterday ( October 212021) I wanted to listen to a local am station but the radio would not pick it up just static. I was really disappointed with the radio as it had a favorable review. Now I am trying to return the radio and amazon says  that I am out of the return window by a few days I think the final date that was set by amazon was October 16 2021.I was totally unaware of the imposed date until I tried to return the radio.
4,this radio pick up my hard to get stations in my basement.  great little radio   but not so little..jj
5,I bought this for my husband that likes to take on vacation and listen to a program that comes on early in the morning. You knocked it out of the park. He loved it. It was just what he wanted.
5,This radio is perfect for those who have to ride in a truck all day had want some tunes.  Attaches easily attaches to visor with an elastic band.  Stations come in great and sound is clear.
5,I bought this radio for my 84 years old mom and she loves it. I was looking for the radio that is easy to use with clear and loud sound because she has a hearing problem. We r very satisfied with this product.
5,I like it
5,There is nothing to dislike about this radio.
3,A little too small but still acceptable. Wish it had station presets but otherwise the radio is acceptable.
1,Digital display stopped working after 3 weeks and it will not stay on the station. Very poor radio for the money. Would not recommend to anyone.
3,The radio is nice but it didn’t work out for me Because we live in an area where there’s not a good reception/signal. So we’re holding onto it just in case we have an emergency and need to listen to the radio to get instructions.
3,I purchased the radio to listen to AM sports channels.  It works perfectly for my uses.
5,I bought this as a replacement for a radio I had purchased for my father in law 7 years ago and he absolutely loves it.  The quality of sound is good and is light weighed so he is able to carry it easily.
5,Got it to replace a radio with bad reception. Work in an office with no windows and a metal roof. This one tunes in FM station like a champ! Highly recommend!
5,I like it because it is a nice size and easy to operate good sound quality.  I use it mainly in my garage. Brings back the good ole days lol
4,Works great! My dad can hear his radio shows perfectly which is why we got it in the first place!
5,I like this radio very much.  It got me through a weeklong power outage due to an ice storm.  Sound and reception is very good .  I used this radio almost day and night for the week and the sound is still strong good battery capacity.
5,For what this radio cost I love it. I have a BOSE sitting right next to it but in the morning I just like turning in on from the knob to my favorite station. It sounds great for the money. I would recommend and buy it again.
5,This radio is great! I love the sound quality. You would think for a somewhat small radio it wouldn’t be so loud but it is and the reception is great. I had a much larger radio but couldn’t get any reception on it.
5,I like everything about this radio. It's great! Tuning it is super easy. I don't have to guess where the station is now. Sound is great too.
5,Awesome little radio! Good sound just super cool n handy to throw on the jazz or the baseball game! Haven’t taken to river yet but once I get some rechargeable batteries in that size that’s where it’s going!
5,Hefty with a removable A\C cord that won't keep getting in the way. Digital station readout keeps the guesswork at bay. You always know where on the dial you are.
1,Indide a home its not picking up FM stations. Will have to turn and move around to get the station at one spot . Poor reception
5,I was looking to replace a cheaper radio that couldn't receive properly through summer humidity and storms.  This radio is a little powerhouse.  Very good value for money.  I highly recommend.
5,Easy to use. Good sound and size speaker for its size. Batteries I bought and installed only work if plug is pulled off the radio. So if it’s plugged in you won't wear your batteries down.
5,It is difficult to get reception where we live.  This is the best radio that I have found so far.
4,I have not had it but just a few days but  I am very happy.
5,I bought this for my 97 year old mother and it is perfect!  Easy to use volume and channel changers.  Good sound.  Picks up many more channels than another radio I purchased.  I haven't used the shortwave feature so can't review that.
5,This GREADIO is truly a great radio especially for my elderly mother. The only challenge is setting the time after a power outage.
5,Bought the radio for a senior citizen.  It's easy to use sound us crystal clear and solidly made.
2,I like the radio but I can't get clear signals on any station.  I'm planning to take it to a person who works on radios and get him to tell me if I am not using it properly.  I think that may be the case.  If it is and he can show me what I am doing wrong to get better signals then I will be very happy.
3,Does not have New Zealand 3 pin 240 volt mains power plug
5,Bought this to replace an old radio that did not have digital tuning. Plugged it in and got many more stations with ease.
1,This radio was fine as far as sound goes but after using it for a total of about 48 hrs it quit!  Because I didn't use it much until after the 30 day return policy I'm out of luck.  To the trash it goes!  I'm very disappointed in this product.
5,Got this radio to entertain my cat when I go away. The sound quality and size is just what the doctor ordered to meet the task of keeping my cat company when I'm not home.
1,This radio stop working after a few days. Some times it works other it does not. No rhyme or reason. The digital display also went out.
5,Great for me I like it portable take it to any room you may not like the ac cord it can be installed wrong it can be plugged in two ways only 1 is right and no instructions for setting clock
4,Like the clock but wish you could use the 12 hr clock with am and pm
5,Live in a modern STEEL and CONCRETE apartment bldg. Had 2 radios that would not pick up my favorite station. Plugged the Greadio in and to my surprise my station came ion strong.  Very happy with this radio.
5,My husband loves this radio!  He works out in the garage a lot and the radio has great range!!
5,It was great perfect
5,This is the product I wanted. It has all the features that I want.
1,Good not great from April 2022 purchase. Died yesterday—FIVE MONTHS for unknown reasons. Digital tuning was blank. Would not pick up ANY stations AM or FM. Never used the battery option. Plug in only in a climate-controlled room. Would NOT recommend this product. RIP OFF!!!!
4,CONTROLS VERY EASY. BANDS EASILY AVAILABLE.Short wave difficult to tame.
5,I liked the price. It came to my home fast. It work perfectly. The only slight dislike was the clock works on military time but thats o.k. because i am a vet. Very good product.
5,great small radio  Has a good reception range
5,I was looking for a simple radio for the barn. This is perfect - good sound quality for the price easy to operate and gets good reception. My husband did ask if I traveled back in time to buy it but I think it's cute.
3,Radio receives and plays reasonably well. Runs fine on batteries. Comes with an AC power cord but doesn't work at all with the AC cord plugged in.
1,Mine expired just one month after the warranty did. Before that I often had to turn it on and off before it would receive. Tuning drifted even when it was not touched and even 50K powerhouse stations were sometimes difficult to focus in on. Since I only used to listen when in my bedroom I just lived with it. But it has now died completely no matter what I try.
5,Fast service.  Good product quality.  Easy to use.  Best bang for the buck.
5,This was purchased for my 89 yr old mother for the simplicity of its functions. Her eyesight is quite poor and the large digital numbers are very helpful. The knobs are large and uncomplicated.
5,quality of sound and volume. Love having a choice for low or high volume so when it is over by the pond 75 yards away I can still hear the music on my deck!
5,This is an excellent inexpensive radio for near water !  Battery operated and comes in fantastic !SOOOO  easy to use...display is large and clear.  Highly recommended !!!
5,Though I miss a station selecter feature the large digital display and large tuning knob make it very easy to tune the radio to the desired station.  The sound quality is excellent.
5,I use this for news -- tuned to the local news channel.  Reception is static free and the speaker is good quality.
5,Camp radio
5,Loving the sound easy to read LED portability and quality feel of this radio.  It is small and the perfect size to take around the house yard and garage.  And yes the volume does get loud and clear!
5,Has a loud speaker good little radio easy to charge or use batteries
1,The radio works well enough but the digital display fades to the point you can't tell the time or what station you are trying to locate.  I would recommend the old style with a dial.
5,I bought this as a gift for someone who loses power.  Able to get very clear radio stations.  Its light and portable.  Highly recommend this radio.
1,Had the radio one week and the LCD stopped displaying the station.  Poor reception even with the antenna extended.
2,The only things I like on this radio are the easy on off knob and the tuning dial. You have to understand this radio uses a 24 hour time system so 5pm is 17:00 11pm is 23:00 an so forth. My radio has a loose plug that keep falling out and that makes you reset the time over and over when it happens. If you use batteries they won't last long and you need 4 D batteries to run it. The sound is good and its easy to set up but I was expecting more.
5,Love this radio just like the old fashioned ones.
5,I wanted a radio to listen to when I have home projects. Take the radio with me in garage or downstairs. Where ever I am doing my projects. It's perfect and love it!
5,I wanted a raido that was to be plugged in.But also was battery operated .Around here we lose power and I need the SW
1,I loved this radio as long as it lasted.  I had it for only 4 months when it mysteriously just stopped working.  The tuning dial stopped functioning and it was not possible to tune in any stations - FM or AM.  So buyer beware.
5,Good sound and short wave pulled in Spanish stations! Has batteries for when power goes out in my area.
5,Has a good sound for a portable radio
3,ok I guess
5,I like to listen while i work and this is easy to move around.
5,We bought this radio to take camping. It works great. Good sound easy to find stations and lightweight. Very happy with this product.
4,Good sound & good recption
5,Great sound
5,I liked the quality of the sound.
5,This works great for going to the drive-in movie! Excellent sound quality!
3,I needed a battery operated radio for getting news etc if/when my power is out..ie after a hurricane
5,I like the digital read out for the radio stations....and the pulling power of am stations is very good....fm stations seems to be excellent also.  The design is easy to work with ...good basic radio
2,The item I got does not have the best reception.
5,Great radio bought it for my mom large dialseasy for her to use good sound picks up all the stations she likes. Good size radio  too.
4,good
5,Great product
1,I had the radio for 2 days when it just quit working altogether.
5,I have really bad reception in my house portable radioes don’t work all static Bought this radio because it can be used with electricity Love this radio
5,Pops in law loves this radio does what it says very cool
5,I work in an area that is very difficult to get a signal. This radio delivers. It is awesome. I am very happy with this product.
1,This product works for about 5 minutes and then goes off the air which isn't a problem with the radio station because I checked on other devices.
5,I live in the foothills of central California and need a reliable AM/FM/SW radio with good reception. This seems to fit the bill.
5,Easy to find you way through the different selections the radio has to offer.
5,Radio works well only downside for me is that the clock can't. be changed from 24 hr. to 12 hr. The sound quality is surprisingly good for a small radio.
3,Bought for the advertised quality reception. The actual reception was no better than existing radios.
5,Compact size but still great reception.  I personally prefer a radio to streaming for my news and music.  Ordered one for my work office and one for home.  Very happy with my selection.
5,Had brought one before.  Great sound and quality led me tp purchase another.
5,Every thing works well. We got it to use with storms. Our power goes off a lot. We needed one that will work with batteries.
5,RECEPTION IS STRONG AND CLEAR!!!!!. I HAD ANOTHER RADIO IN MY OFFICE AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE AM STATION I NORMALLY WOULD LISTEN TO. I'M VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS RADIO!!.
5,Ordered for my mom so that she could see what radio station she was listening to. Display is large and easy to see.
5,Bought for my mom. She can’t stop talking about how much she loves it. Very easy to use and the sound quality is great !
1,You get what you pay for.  Lasted 2 1/2 months.  New batteries and/or DC adapter couldn’t bring it back to life.
3,You get what you pay for.  I’m spoiled with my echo’s sound and tone.  This gets by in the case of emergency.
5,Great radio for indoor or outdoor listening. Obviously not a big sound but just what I need for simple listening.
5,Todo perfecto justo el radio que estaba buscando. Fácil de usar. Todo perfecto.Coge AM y FM. El volumen fabuloso. Esmuy práctico.Lo recomiendo.
3,Poor volume had to turn up all the way to hear it and reception was poor
5,I love that it's light weight I use it alot when I'm outside working and doing things around the house
5,x
5,Easy to use we use while working in the yard or relaxing in the gazebo has great sound no static or fading out
5,I love this radio and I recommend use an "external antenna" for better SW reception in AM and FM the sound quality it's perfect.
1,It just quit working after only a few weeks.
5,Great product sounds awesome will be putting it in my 4x4 for fun beach days and camping I love it
5,Works great in the warehouse at work.  With the digital dial it is easy to find the station you want.
5,I use this at lake Gaston Va. It is the third radio I bought & the only one of the three that works out in the boonies!!!
1,This WAS easy to use although the volume control knob when turned on jumped to LOUD. In addition this afternoon ( less than 2 months after I bought this) thee radio tipped over on the knob side.. NOW there is NO VOLUME although I can get any channel I want!!!! I should have known this price was too good to be true.. And wouldn't you know they only give a 4 week time period to return.Piece of junk
5,Replaced 20 Year Old Radio this easily tunable to stations with digital displayWas pleasantly surprised with sound qualityWorks with batteries or has line cord for direct connection to 120Vac
1,Junk my car received 30 stations this radio received 1
5,Great quality and great sound
3,This is a nice radio but unfortunately it is not digital. When switching from AM to FM and back again it does not retain the  frequency requiring frequent retuning.
3,Works well analogue control digital display no seek function or SSB.
5,The sound for such a small radio is fantastic.  I can also get stations 100 mile from where I live.
5,I really like the tuner with a digital readout.  Much easier to get the station I want.
5,My dad loved this radio. It’s the best thing since sliced bread he is 70yrs
5,Picks up channels I have a hard time getting in my truck batteries last a long time sound is good
5,Good sound. Easy to use and has excellent reception.
3,Sounds great.  But the on/off/sound knob was horrible.  I bought this for my desk at work.  Trying to have low sound was impossible.
5,Wife is very happy with her new radio. She was so tired of her alarm clock radio.
5,Bought this for a bathroom radio to listen while showering or brushing.Sounds clear. I wish it had presets but the tuner is easy to work and and very sensitive.
3,Does not pick up as clearly as I would have liked.
5,have a small yard and a lots of small yard projects.  radio is pretty perfect for yard use.
5,I take my radio outside when I am working on the yard.  I get very little static or interference.
5,Right size for our remodel master bathBattery operation eliminated need for AC cordNice tonal quality feature
5,Finally I can listen to talk radio without being in the car!
5,I liked that it performs exactly as described and was very easy to set up.  It also has very good reception.
5,Nice lightweight design.  Displays the time when not in use.  Great purchase for the money
5,I like this radio a lot. The sound is very clear and it is easy to operate. The size is right. It was just what I wanted.
1,Worked well for 6 weeks. No contact info to get benefit of stated one year warranty.very disappointing.
5,It was bought for my elderly mom so she could sit on the patio and listen to music
1,There is no lit LCD screen on this radio....
5,This radio is great. The quality is very good and well made. Would recommend to friends and family.
3,My expectations were that the radio will have alarm and a 12 hour am/pm features.
5,Using the radio to listen to the Braves games.
5,Radio gets good reception even in our basement. Digital tuner makes finding stations easy. Very happy with this radio!
5,Great for finding the AM stations
5,Radio as expected. Reception is great. Picks up the stations I listen to.
5,we use this radio to carry around in the yard while doing yardwork.  we are very happy with it!
5,Great sound!
5,Works great for what I needed it to do!
5,If you can’t get decent reception or no reception this is the radio for you. Has great sound too.
1,The box came crushed on one end. The crooked tuning knob was pushed into the radio on the crushed end such that it was hard to turn. The tuning is not accurate with the only radio station I could get on the lower end of FM coming in on 95.7 95.8 95.9 96.0 and 96.1 and it wasn't local. The antenna is the shortest antenna I've ever seen on an FM/SW radio at 23" and reception suffers greatly. Does not pick up any SW stations at my location in the Midwest and I don't live in the boonies. Pick up only 2 FM stations here (1 is in town) and the AM is too noisy to listen to. This is like a radio you might find at a flea market for $10 or less. Totally overpriced for the quality! I'm very disappointed.
5,No way to turn on lite so it hard to find station.
5,no bstterys included
5,Got the radio for my wife. She wanted a simple radio. She is very pleased
5,I like everything about this radio.  One thing I wished there was a button to select the channels.
5,Just received today. Reception is awesome and sound quality is excellent for a small radio. Would definitely buy again
5,Nice size radio. Easy to use. Use it in my fishing boat.
5,Radio works very well! I like the digital tuning feature and the sound quality is very good.
5,I have a special needs son and he caught right on as how to use it.
5,This radio is perfect for my office
5,I ordered this for my elderly Mom and she loves it. The large knobs are perfect for her.
5,We baught this to use going to a Drive In Theater.Workrs great.
3,Radio only gives military time. Good reception and good sound
5,My husband loves his radio that he got for his birthday Sun.
5,Perfect for what I need and at a reasonable price.
3,It's OK.  Tuning could be a little more accurate.
1,can see the stations
1,I bought this product a little over a month ago (6 weeks to be exact) and it already broke.  I was listening to the radio and all of a sudden the station starting glitching and it wont stay on the station I pick.  It keeps flickering between that station and a 0.2 hertz higher station but at super speed and nothing but static comes out of the speakers.  I wasted my money on this thing but I'd advise everyone else don't waste yours.
5,Easy to use and sound quality is great
5,Perfect selection for my 96 year old mother extremely simple to operate!!
2,While my car gets decent FM reception this radio gets almost nothing. I am very dissatisfied with the results on FM. I hope to be able to exchange or return this item for something that actually can pick up FM stations in remote areas.
1,It Looks cool but dies soon
3,function knob not lined up with decal. tuner knob very sensitive. All works ok though
5,I like the digital dial.  Put in the precise number and there it is.  It's much better than the sliding dial.
5,We LOVE our new radio! Very good sound and reception. The Customer service was the best! Thank you!
5,looks goodsounds goodworks good thats all the goods i can think of if more it's good there 2
5,Todo estuvo muy bien la entrega excelente.

5,Liked the mobility and sound quality
5,Received it fast and in good shape.  The radio sounds very good.
5,I like its small size while still having excellent sound quality.
5,Great reception and easy to read controls.
5,radio came in fine shape and has good reception
2,This radio is advertised as having good to great reception. The good news is that the fm reception to low power stations such as npr is very good which is why I am thinking about keeping it. The bad news is that you can scroll all the am stations and get maybe get one station and get zero sw stations.
3,Not picking up as many channels as I was hoping
3,its ok but it has nothing to make it better than anoher
3,The Radio's okay shortwave reception is very poor.
5,Me encanto tamaño fácil de usar y sobre todo muy como de ubicar un sitio para usarlo .
1,Complete garbage.  The screen went out after 4 days and the radio stopped functioning entirely after 8 days.
5,Good sound. Dials in AM nicely
5,Perfect for replacing 25 year old boom box!
5,Great sound! Easy to use.
5,Great radio. My husband loves it!
5,Good for camping able to get my stations and they came in clear.
5,I liked the fact that the shortwave radio was not too heavy
5,For such a small phone it sounds great
5,Lightweight. Good sound. Long antenna. Gets a lot of stations
5,I now am able to receive several radio stationsGood buy!!
5,Great radio. Filling all the needs we had in a portable radio. Good sounds easy to tune in.
5,Great to have an AM radio without static.
5,This radio actually sounds great and has great reception..
5,NOTHING to dislike
1,LCD Display which indicates channel selection stopped working in three weeks time.
1,This radio I bought was a big mistake. After few months don’t work properly. No control on the sound and volume. Timer is disappear and bad connection with any radio frequency
5,A wonderful radio with good reception for both AM and FM.
5,A quality product at a great price.
3,Clock
5,Low price good for listening to the news
5,radio surprisingly had really good am and fm reception
1,A gift sound is good if the cord would stay in the radio .
5,Nice large Display for time and radio
5,GREAT PRODUCT
5,I like this radio
2,I am unable to receive any SW stations. AM stations are few and weak. FM stations are plentiful but the turner doesn't latch onto the frequency very well. Signal drifts in and out or is not located on the frequency they are transmitting on. Overall  mediocre performance.
5,Good Radio and excellent value.
5,does not  recharge batteries when plugged in to elect
5,Sound quality is surprisingly good!
5,Works great! Exactly what I needed! A++
5,As advertised - good deal...
5,Surprisingly a great little radio
5,How loud it plays.
2,Somehow this radio got incredible reviews. I don't know how. It's nothing special.It's a OK but the tuning is terrible. You go to the numbers on the screen to be on the station and it's nowhere near it.
1,Great radio. I bought one last month and sounds great easy to use and display is bright and very visible from any angle. However It purchased another this one sounds great but no display. So I can't tune the radio. Also has a rather long delay on the volume when turned on. Returning. Would like another but one that works just like the first one. I would still recommend it though.
5,Muy buena recepción y sonido agradable.
5,Very good radio I enjoy it very much
5,Tuning could be a little less sensitive but still works very well.
1,I purchased this radio because in description says it has a good reception and it is highly rated… and THAT IS NOT TRUE! I got the radio and for few day I was just traveling with it inside the house every corner bathroom  garage kitchen front yard etc. and signal was on/ off  statics and undistinguished radio stations! That is a shame because the radio is beautiful physically and comfortable to carryover. Sorry…. Try it before buying it!!!
5,Very happy with the purchase excellent radio
1,Terrible the clock didn’t work from day 1 below average reception cord attachment very poor quality would never buy anything from this company again!!!
5,Todo
5,Reception is great for long distance FM stations
5,When storms occur will be helpful when electric is out.
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,reliable
5,Nice little AM/FM radio! I like that it is also a shortwave radio.
1,Didn't evan work for a week. Lost the FM side. Started to make bunch of weird noises.
1,Received the radio on 2/16/21 tried it out and immediately put it back in the box to return it.  The tuning dial on the radio did not work I was unable to tune in any stations on the FM dial from 91 FM to 99 FM and could not  tune in the AM stations from 600 AM to 1200 AM.  I had a Grundig Yacht Boy radio that was in use for 31 years until it died and was hoping this radio would work to just a fraction of the Yacht Boy  the radio didn't even last 10 minutes!  What a terrible product!  Would have given the rating zero stars if I could have.
5,For news andMusic
5,Great & simple
1,I bought this item as a gift so I bought it early. The item doesn’t work! The radio part turns on but no sound comes out… tried changing stations and still doesn’t work. Since I bought it early for a gift to make sure I had it- I can not return because it fell outside of the return timeframe. Don’t buy this if you’re wanting a radio that actually works.
5,I hate military time. Can't choose time formula you want.
1,Got it out of the box plugged it in it sounded wonderful and went dead. Did everything I could to make it work and nothing.Sent back. So disappointed 😞
5,Perfect size. Love it also because it can take batteries or plug in.
5,Herat quality radio. Heavy duty well made.
5,Very satisfied with product.
5,Great little radio for local listeners!
2,Radio not worth its premium price. Hoping for an upgrade to my other cheap radios. My use is exclusively for AM talk and sports shows.  D size batteries don’t make good in the battery compartment  so I have to keep close to a receptacle.  Would not recommend.
5,👍‼️
5,great value works better than more costly units. great buy
1,AM stations do not tune in
5,I like it!
5,Just what my dad needed! Super easy to operate!
5,I like the radio.
5,Clear reception
5,Radio for patio
5,Quick shipping and as advertised..
5,it was easy to understand
5,Reception
5,Very nice radio. Good reception plays clear.
1,Very nice radio and have no issues with it but surely the folks sending the radio would have noted that the address was not in North America but they sent me a radio that was for use in USA ( 110 volt) not the 220 volt required in my country so now have a radio that I cannot use off home power only batteries.Endeavoring to get a voltage adaptor.  Thought about sending it back but costs will be about the same. Maybe I was at fault by not making this clear on my initial order.
5,Work
5,Excellent Radio
2,I bought this hoping the digital tuning would give me better reception then my old analog radio.  It will not stay on frequency and is actually worse then the analog tuning.  My advice is to save your money.
1,It’s not a good product. Not by a long shot. It keeps time in 24 hours military time. The sound is NASTY loaded with static. And the stations drift and are noisy.
5,Very impressed
5,n/a
5,Parents love it
5,My mom loved it she hear her radio every morning
5,sounds good.
1,Disliked the fact it only lasted 2 weeks
5,I am enjoying my radio.
5,Functionality and price.
5,Use it everyday!
5,It Works
5,Very light weight can take anywhere
1,I bought this radio because of its large digital display (which is great) but its sound quality is poor to nonexistent!
5,Very good
2,This is a very cheap radio  with very poor sound quality . Not worth the price  even though its in-expensive .
5,Nice sound
1,Cheap junk ! Long delivery delays other item still not in. NO RECEPTION ! Can't even pick up my favorite strong local station ! The junk it did pick up has very poor quality sound. Bottom line..... you get what you pay for. My mistake for giving this garbage a chance and I ordered 3 for X-Mas. Will return all.
5,Newsmusic fm.
1,Had i known it was this light weight and flimsy never would have ordered
1,I was very disappointed in this radio.  The sound quality is extremely poor on both the AM and FM bands.  In addition to that the radio seems to suddenly jump off whatever frequency it is tuned to and starts picking up stray noise. I tried this radio all over the house and even outside but that did not help the reception.  I wanted to replace my 30 year old battery powered emergency radio with a new one but I'll just keep my old one.
1,I purchased this radio because of the statement “ best reception “ .I should have asked “ compared to what “I live on a mountainous area  so i anticipated difficult reception .I got zero reception . Not a single station on am or fm or short wave .I suppose I'm going to have to consult a radio  professional .So the radio will go back tomorrow .
1,Bad AM reception and no way to add an additional antenna
1,Bonito radio buen sonido y fácil de usar….pero sólo dura 2 horas de funcionamiento…. Se dañó muy rápidoal parecer la calidad de sus componentes es mala..!!!! Terminé devolviendo el 📻 radio… una pena!!!
1,I bought this for elderly lady to have during power outages. Doesn’t work with brand name batteries.
1,Batteries do not fit
1,The clock on this radio is only in military 2400 hours time.The clock only works when the radio is not playing.The clock stopped working in less than 60 days.This radio is really a piece of junk.Too bad Amazon shifted returns from 90 days to only 30 days.It usually takes junk at least 31 days to quit working.Therefor no return of radio.
1,stopped working 9 months after purchase
1,I ordered this radio for emergency purposes and wanted one that gives me great reception. Buzzing sound over all am and fm channels and poor reception.  The description sounded like this was the one that would give great reception. NO.  I just tried this radio because the hurricane season is upon us now but was very disappointed with the poor reception.
1,The AM reception is terrible.  Even with the antenna up I could only receive one AM station clearly.  Other AM radios work OK in our home so it is not an AM transmission problem.  I should have believed the other one star reviews on Amazon which say AM reception is bad!!.
2,Good on FMFair on AMPoor on SW - frequency spacing is wrong (should be 5 KHz) so only 1/4 of channels tune....
2,It will do what I want get information during a major power outage. Signals have to be close and strong.
1,The radio and LED screen stopped working after a few days.Sound quality of the speaker is poor.  To turn the power off you use the volume button.  So you aren't able to keep the volume at the same level when powering on and off.Not recommend.
1,The radio didn’t work and I returned it!
1,Very poor reception - can only get 3 stations - clock is 24 hour only
1,This radio is a piece of junk it lasted just passed the return date you can not change the stations or the volume can not change the time. I think it's a worthless Radio. In my option go to Walmart for a radio that works.
2,About what I suspected for the price. Poor reception thru all 3 bands.
1,Had high hopes this little radio would be just the ticket for what I needed but found that the sensitivity and selectivity are both missing. SW is non existent FM runs all together AM is pathetic.Spend a little more money and get a good radio.  Oh  sound and volume control are both very good.
1,Stopping working after 30 days
2,Radio works ok but clock is only military time. Volume gets louder the longer it plays. Would not buy again.
2,Doesn’t work well on battery power at all and takes too long to initialize when turned on.
2,Reception very poor across both AM and FM.
2,Sound is lousy.Volume control isn't smoothDoesn't hold the frequency
1,This Radio is a pile of Chinese JunkThe radio will work but the clock will not function and never has.Joseph Bath
1,never worked right light an cheaply made tinny sound bad quality
1,I bought this based on the positive reviews about the sound quality.  That was NOT true. The sound is very inferior and to me that's the most important feature of a radio. Regret buying this.
1,It did not pick up the radio signals I wanted to have local radio in my office. I work in a secure location and wanted to at least listen to the radio and got nothing. Wasted my money.
1,Went to use this radio for about the sixth time and kaput.  Batteries or AC power won't work.
1,poor-poor sound!!!!
1,Just stopped working after a few weeks
1,I should've sent back this radio. The volume control is very sensitive and it's nearly impossible to regulate the volume. The digital tuner doesn't function like you'd expect so you can't really "tune in" to a certain channel.
1,This radio is okay for AM/FM but for shortwave..buy a different product! It doesn't pickup any shortwave stations just a bunch of static!
1,After a month of use the volume stopped working.  Just very low sound.  Changed batteries and plugged in still not working.  The return policy ended 8 days ago :(
1,Setup difficult struggled to attach power supply cord.  Sound quality poor.
1,It was great until it died and is a complete loss. I haven't even owned it a year.
1,Day one radio works great Good reception and good toneDay two. Turne on radio display shows rado and nothing else happens no sound no music not nothing Chage battereies use AC cord nothingWaste of money
1,I can barely turn volume up because the speaker is awful. Very Tinny with reverb! If it wasn't such a hassle I would return it. Junk!!
1,The volume control will not control the volume. It is very loud or nothing. Very poor product
1,the dial does not light up the radio cant be used in a dark room. I want to return this item for credit please advice how
1,EDIT: After five months of use this portable radio is changing every single station by itself and I can't listen one in peace and the volume is increasing/decreasing constantly. RN I have to buy another one because this one fail.
1,It worked for about 30 days and then broke just asothers said it did for them. The guts are too fragile totake any sort of use. Not worth the experience.
1,The screen on this radio would not ‘hold’ the time/station numbers. Did not keep correct time. Overall very poor quality.
1,Bad reception
1,It just broke won’t work anymore
1,The reception was terrible  could only pick up 2 FM stations
1,Probably the worst radio I've ever purchased I have an old transistor radio with better everything !!!
1,I cannot get it to work which is most frustrating!
1,Doesn’t work at all. Tried both garage and house. Returning
1,You can't communicate only listen
1,Nothing doesn t turn on .. hurricanes weather alerts
1,My radio did not work.  No sound at all. Return for a refund
1,The radio I received did not work nothing but static and only get three stations which again was static
1,Reception was terrible two stations at one time could not fine tune
1,worked well initially but just stopped after about 2 weeks
1,Really junky...somewhat like what you may get in a give away when you purchase something else
1,It loses the radio station and you can’t turn it back in the digital feature on it sucks
1,Not a good product and sorry I ordered
1,Este tipo de pilas ya es obsoletas no se consiguen facilmente
1,The volume was so low
5,Just what I wanted.A great sound AM stations. FFFFFFFFWM to listen static free stations and overseas  to shortwave stations.Easy to carry around. I# take mine to my garden. Avery nice price too.
1,wasted my money on this crap.
1,Bad reception
1,Returned this item.  We found another radio we liked better
5,I like it.
1,Lousy AM reception
1,no substance
4,If you liked how radios worked in around the 1970s but want a digital display this radio is for you!  And I don't mean that in a bad way really.  It's a super basic radio.  It has AM FM and shortwave it has a volume control and an antenna and it has a low or high tone (I'm not sure about what that really does) and a side tuner knob.  That's it along with a fairly good sized one speaker.  No presets no digital radio no stereo none of that.  I actually kind of enjoyed that!  I tuned around the FM and AM dial and found some stations in my area I haven't heard before.  It seems fairly good at picking up station.  I couldn't raise anything on the shortwave dial but I'm not going to rate down for that as due to sunspots shortwave is awful right now.The tuning dial does go pretty fast---it's hard to get it to stop on just where you want on the dial but with some work I was able to.  The sound quality depends on how clearly the station comes in but it has a pretty good sound for a small mono radio.I think this would be a great gift for an older person who just wants to be able to listen to the radio and doesn't want to fool around with all kinds of bells and whistles.  It's sturdy simple and can run on batteries as well as a cord.  Nothing spectacular but I like it!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The radio feels solid and it is well built but it is not heavy.  It is about 1.5 lbs and it has a very sturdy handle. It reminds me of my grandmother's 5-lb big radio at her garage.  The looks of this radio is old fashion but it has the LCD display and the advance digital signal processor (DSP) chip so it is like an old car with a new paint job and a new engine. I enjoyed something that looks vintage but filled with modern technology.The radio signal reception of this radio is unbelievable.  It picks up many radio stations that I have never heard of before and the signals are strong and the sounds are clear.  The knobs are big and easy to turn and the digits showing on the LCD screen is bright with big numbers. The speaker is surprisingly loud and it is very clear.  There is no sound distortion even I turned the music up very high.  However there is no bass and it lacks of mid so it can only deliver music in a flat tone but the sound will fill the room and it is very clear. The tuning knob is very sensitive see video I don’t need to turn it much to change the stations.The power cable is about 5 feet long and it is long enough for most places I will put the radio. It takes four D batteries to power this radio but I guess it is the best option during a blackout and emergency.  I just need to remember to buy some and keep them handy.  It works like a digital clock when the radio is off so I would recommend taking out the batteries before storage or the batteries will be slowly drain by the clock. Overall it is a great radio that can pick up a lot of radio stations clearly and it has big sound.  It will be a great lifesaver when my power or internet is out and it does happen once in a while.
4,This is a nice and sturdy portable radio. It works great and gets the job done. The retro look is classic and the build quality is decent. At just a little over 1.5 lb it is quite light and portable. I like that it is dual powered either by 4 D cell batteries or from a power outlet via the power cord.The digital radio works well and is easy to tune. The radio reception is pretty good. Extending the telescopic antenna helps a lot. The sound quality is decent too. It sounds clean and clear but bass is lacking as expected. It's good for listening to news weather forecast etc. You can adjust the tone to your liking too. It has a headphone jack but I have no use for it. The digital clock is a nice touch.Overall this is a decent portable radio for home use or outdoor use. The dual power makes it really useful in case of an emergency and power outage when you need to keep up with weather forecast etc. It's worth giving it a try. Pretty good product.
3,I guess what I was expecting was an improvement over the years in a product that has been around in one form or another for my entire life. This is not an improvement. The radio itself is medium sized takes conventional batteries and has a conventional metal antenna. It has good not great reception in all bands that it will get. The sound is subpar. Though the speaker is large it is cheap and sounds it. Though the radio has tone settings one makes the music sound muffled and like it is in a can and the other adds extreme treble and eliminates most bass. In either setting the sound is off and the speaker vibrates in the case to an annoying degree. The volume is not loud enough for garage or work site and breaks up and distorts at about 2/3rds volume.The tuning while digital in reading is un-precise and hard to set to a specific band. It took me to a good 15 seconds to make the digital reading get to 102.3 as it kept missing higher and lower with the slightest of turns.The only thing that I truly found to be useful is the shortwave function and only because I like to peak around and see who is on and what is being said on these seldom used bands. Still tuner is not precise enough to narrow in a specific band setting.
5,This is a nice radio.  It has decent sound it picks up a lot of stations and it is very easy to use.  It has a pretty cool almost retro look.  The build is pretty nice and this would be a decent radio to use pretty much anywhere.  It isn't as good as my 30 year old boom box but then again not much is.  This is good enough and gets the job done.I live by Los Angeles and there are a ton of stations.  This little radio seems to pick a lot of them up.  There is some overlap on a few but nothing that is really distracting.  I just moved on to another station.  FM works well and the sound is pretty decent.  AM works as well and the talk stations come in great.  Tuning is a snap.  You tune you listen.This is a portable radio.  It has a good sound and you an listen to it while you walk.  Just like we did in the 80's.  When you get to your destination you can listen some more.Build wise this is a solid radio.  It is built well and it will last as long as it is taken care of.  The buttons knobs and whatever are on tight and are easy to move around.If you are looking for a cool little portable radio check this one out.  It is really nice.
4,This radio is super old-school but with a new vibe to it. You can either use batteries or plug it in so if you’re on the girl you have the opportunity to use it with batteries which is great for when we go to parks only want to play music. You can see the time on the screen which is a nice addition. It has a fairly large antenna so you can reach a great service and have clear reception while out. I like to play music from the radio all the time and use this old school method of listening to music and the news. You can access all the stations without any issues. The aesthetics of those radio is really nice it has that old school radio by with a new school look. It’s not too heavy so it’s easy to transport. This would be a great gift for an older person or someone like me that likes using radios.
4,There’s nothing fancy about it but it sounds good and does the job. It comes with a regular wall plug to power it or it can be operated with four D Cell Batteries which makes it great for emergencies. It’s a digital radio but the stations are adjusted with a knob instead of a button and I think it’s better that way.  It has AM/FM and Shortwave Radio settings. I’m not an Radio Aficionado but it currently costs $31.92 and I think it’s a little much for what it is. All in all I think it’s a decent radio though.
1,The sound quality is fuzzy at best. Not sensitive or selective. Won't get most stations. The volume starts off at too high of a volume showing poor design. Don't waste your money.
3,Summary: Overall I'm disappointed by the reception with this radio both AM and FM bands.Observations: In my area there are 28 FM and 17 AM radio stations.  With the antenna only I was able to listen to: 6/17 (35%) AM and 23/27 (85%) FM stations.  By listen to I mean that I could understand what was being said but there could be static.  Next I added some test leads to extend the antenna after which I could listen to many more AM radio stations.  This is disappointing to me because as an electrical engineer my understanding is that AM is the easier of the two bands to receive since the frequency is lower which makes the wave lengths longer which generally means longer reception distances; but this radio exhibits the exact opposite performance.Recommendations: According to the instructions "NOTE: If you have bad reception please extend the antenna and change direction to improve the reception."  That did not work and as a test I connected some alligator test leads to the antenna and hung them from the top of the window (see pic).  That worked better but is not ideal as it is no longer portable.  On a related note the antenna is 24" when extended.Pros: Decent fit & finish; dual power source (D-cell/AC).Cons: Poor reception.Conclusion: At $40 rating this one 3-stars but not recommending.
5,Thank you 💞
5,This thing has an awesome old school look to it.  I love the atmosphere it brings to any room I put it in.It puts out a surprising amount of volume.  I like using it in my shop and I don't even have to crank it all the way to hear it behind my tools.The knobs all feel well made.  They turn with what feels like quality components and there isn't any jitter in the feedback.It picks up signal very well.  I can get all the local stations without even having to pull the antenna up.I like that it has a headphone port so I can throw a bluetooth transmitter in and listen to the radio on my earbuds without bothering anybody.Overall a great radio.Highly recommended.
5,I remember in like 1977 my dad had a radio like this and a neighbor broke into our house and stole it. Can you imagine someone doing that in 2020+? hah.Anyway this has all of the functionality of the radios of those days but this looks so much betterPros=Love the big digital display. I hated those days where you're trying to align the line with the list of stations before digital displays=Nice big volume + tuning button on the side=As the hilarious photoshop-ed photo shows there's a input for headphones although I imagine it might be a pain lugging this around + using headphones. Who knows. It's a good option=4 (D) batteries can also power it the nightmare of all battery scenarios. Consider possibly 4 rechargeable D batteries.Cons=Price could be lowerMy dad loves putting these in his garage while he works on cars. I think I'll give it to him as a gift or use it for emergencies
4,My dad needed a new radio since his old one is crackling very badly after years of use. this one is small and easy to use. the vocals are very clear and crisp without that annoying buzzing or static noises on most channels. The buttons are easy to press and the overall design is easy to understand and adjust. Overall it is a great product. Highly recommended.
4,I felt like I had stepped back into the 1970s when I turned on this radio. That static-y crackle of inferior speakers the choice of AM or FM (plus SW) had me crusing with my friend after school in a muscle car. Don't expect any recent technology. Sound quality depends largely on reception and this radio comes complete with telescoping antenna.
5,What do you need a radio for in this day and age?  Plenty.  Don't get me wrong I love my phone playlists easy access apps and so on but.... there is something about a radio you just turn  it on and listen don't worry about the mix of songs.  Also good for public emergencies.  At work if you're not allowed a TV GREAT for listening to your favorite sporrts team play.  I know alot of people will not even know what a portable radio is and that's to bad because this is a really good one.  The LCD screen is easy to read finding the right station is also cake.  A nice portable size and the finish is very good.  Sound is good for the one speaker and it will get loud enough for you.  Takes 4 D batteries and comes with an AC cord if needed.  HIghly Reccomended.
5,Greadio portable radio MD-T26I like me some NPR daily but my current retro radio has very poor reception and no external antenna.I like the retro look of  this Greadio. The reception is great - very clear. I like that tuning is via a knob and not by repeated pressing of a button (which takes longer). Volume adjustment is also via a knob. Nice. I've had problems before with a portable digital radio with no knobs. The volume button stopped working worked for a while after spraying with an electronic contact cleaner then eventually completely stopped working. I expect I'll have to disassemble the radio to clean the switch contacts.There's a marked difference when I switch from low to high tone. Low tone makes a person's shrieky voice noticeably less shrieky.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Select this radio to give to my grandfather but before that I used it for a week and was so satisfied that I thought twice before giving it to him.  The sound is fabulous I have not noticed any static that interferes with its sound quality.  The handle is strong its digital display too.  It has a look between retro and modern.  It is lightweight and can be used with batteries to take it to the patio while you garden.  It is ideal for the office and also to take it to the park.  This is a great investment.  Deserves more than 5 stars
4,Pros:1. Good Build Quality2. Simple Operations3. Good Radio ReceptionCons:1. A Bit Expensive Just For A Simple Radio
5,Everything
5,I got the Greadio Portable Shortwave Radio as a Christmas gift for my father as he loves collecting radios.  According to him he really likes this one.  He said the reception is great and he picks up all of his favorite stations and some that he cannot get on other radios.  He likes that there is a handle and that you can plug it in or use batteries.  The LCD screen is clear and large enough to read easily.  Overall this was a great gift which he really enjoys.
5,I live in Florida and I have been looking for a good transistor radio to use when the power may go out. This radio is great.  It is not only an AM/FM radio but also a shortwave radio too. Sound quality is great reception picks up easily in my home. It is definitely piece of mind for anyone who may be in an area prone to power outages. Highly recommend!
5,The radio works really well. Shortwave am and fm stations. Antenna is really long. The volume is very clear and can go up very high great for parties or RV trips!! Beautifully designed and speaker is well made.
5,I installed the batteries in mine but it also plugs into a regular receptacle. No batteries come inside don't confuse this as being made the same as a bluetooth speaker. The sound is amazingly good.
3,We tried this one out with an elderly family member who has been confined due to the pandemic. She loves how easy it is to use and the larger size makes it easier to operate the dials and find the right stations. But the sound quality is lacking. I ran it through several stations and was just not impressed. I had radios growing up and a few of them are still kicking around. This one just doesn't sound good for the price and I don't think it's a good value.There was very very poor reception when trying to find short wave stations and I was frustrated that even local AM stations were coming in sounding tinny and weak.Maybe I got a bad model but this was just not a good value to me.
5,so this short wave radio has both the plug in option as well as the battery options. batteries are not included but takes 4 individual D batteries.
3,After reading some reviews I expected this would be a much better radio the short wave bands didn't receive one station with the recent solar flares poor reception is understood but it still should pul in a few strong stations. The AM Band works OK but my hand held transistor radio does better side by side. The FM Band worked the best but nothing earth shattering. Spend a little more and get a C. Crane Short Wave Radio.
3,This is a good radio. Easy to set anywhere as it doesn't take up much room. Can also be a weather radio.
5,This is a very easy to use radio.  It tunes easily into our favorite radio station and sounds awesome too.  It's portable so we can take it anywhere we want to listen to music when we're not using the car radio.
1,I generally don't write bad reviews but I purchased this radio in February 42021 and on June 52021 4 months later is sounds like it comes on but has no digital display.  When I first got it the radio worked as advertised I should have read and believed the reviews when the warranty is gone so is the product.
3,This is a standard radio except that it can receive shortwave as well as AM/FM frequencies.  The speaker is typical 3.5 in and 2 watts but there is a jack for headphones etc.  The button to set the minutes is hilariously labelled "second".  There is no scan function only a knob for tuning although the radio will automatically adjust the tuning once a channel is selected.  I really miss the scan button but I suppose most people listen to the same station most all of the time anyway.I also don't like the use of styrofoam when recyclable molded wood fiber will perform the same function.The biggest problem is the price.  The radio is only worth fifteen or twenty dollars but it and a multitude of very similar radios are priced at close to twice that amount.  There are smaller AM/FM/SW radios with recognizable brand names available for much less.
1,For a 40 dollar old styled radio this is awful.I love the simple radios like these and we own several and for this being a newer model... the sound quality is so much worse.Definitely not worth the 40 buck price!Do not recommend
5,Has two expensive high quality radios from early 1980.  Both had short wave and I used to get programs from Europe South America and Israel.  Had news from Israel during the Arab Israel war on short wave.  The old radios do not function any more  This new radio is loud and clear without static new technology.  However I do not receive any stations on short wave this is the only problem with this radio.  My old radio was over four hundred dollars.
5,Originally bought this for poolside.  Then I started bringing it indoors to use in whatever room I was cleaning.Now it's in my kitchen and I love listening to it there everyday. Used to have tv on just for the voice but got tired of the constant barrage of depressing news.  Love this radio so much that I'm debating to get another one.
4,There is no way to see the tuning because its meter had  no light.I can't imagine why this rather simple but important feature wasleft out.
5,I live in the country and it picks up Am great.
5,I ordered this after my 3rd Crane & co radio failed.  For the price seems very sturdy; the tuner has a silky feel to it and can easily tune in am & fm easIily
5,Does the job. Was looking for a basic radio and this is it.  Nothing fancy but works not bad for the price.  Would buy again.
5,Received it the same day I placed the order. It  does not get any better than that.
5,All good. So far.
5,I bough this tedious for my mom snd she loves it!
5,This little radio is awesome. It has so many features that one needs in an emergency radio and it also sounds pretty good.
5,Compact good sound great reception
5,Reception reception reception fantastic.Very god reception sound is just right.Great value.
5,Very good
2,Sound quality very poor.  Very difficult to get stations I like. I returned this & bought another for 1/2 the price r& twice the quality
5,The radio was easy to set up and use.  Big dials and big displays.
4,Overall this radio seems to be a nice basic radio. The FM stations come in clear the AM station are harder to find in my area on any radio and the shortwave feature is nice. The only problem with the shortwave side of things is the antenna is too short to be very effective. I do pick up a few shortwave stations at night they just are not as clear as I was custom too growing up.
3,Not a terrible radio but don't get this for sound quality. Pretty sensitive. Selectivity could be better. First LCD display I e ever had where the frequencies weren't spot on. You have to go by sound sometimes rather than the display. 3/5 Radio. Not total trash but not great either.
5,word
4,Accurate station tuning is easily done and the radio has ample volume for easy listening.  The only negative thing is that the radio's clock doesn't remain accurate over several days time.
5,Also The speaker is good quality.
5,Perfect for my needs.
5,this was purchased for an elderly person with low vision. He can see the LED screen with the station and the knobs are a good size for adjusting. He really likes it and said it was the best birthday present.
5,Looks good sounds good price good.
5,RECEPTION IS GREAT
5,Portable radios are almost obsolete with all the new technology available to us.  I grew up with radios. I needed a radio to listen to my local sport talk shows. This radio is perfect for that. Large LCD screen displays time when in off mode user friendly and nice looking model.
5,I love sitting outside with music and relaxing!! The sound is so clear love it
5,The radio is very easy to use and it’s especially easy to find local stations. I live in an area where reception can be difficult so I was pleasantly surprised and pleased.
5,Muy buena compra.
5,I got it for my blind grandmother and she loves it. She can use her headphones when it’s too loud in the house and she loves how easy it is to you.
1,bad reception the knob was very sensitive
5,Really good good  lound thanks
5,great little radio I take one with me wherever I go.
4,Easy to use large digital numbers easy to see
5,I liked the radio itself but prefer a radio that has a rechargeable battery via USB so I returned it.
5,Gave to my brother who absolutely loves this radio. Sound quality is fantastic. He Uses radio outside for sports listening. Thanks Amazon!
4,Would give 5 stars if time was not military time and if there was a switch to turn clock off when radio is off  - but nice radio and great reception.
5,I bought this for my 96 year old stepmother - it is terrific. She can see that it's on the station she wants and there's a simple on/off/volume turn piece.  Just bought a second one for her bedroom. The only improvement would be to have preset button option so she could easily switch to her favorite stations.Things that are designed for older people and people with disabilities usually work well for others. Well organized tactile and visually obvious.
1,Bought in January 2022 by mid February led light went blank then in March 2022 no more sound!!!! Very upset didn’t even last a year!
5,Easy use and perfect for emergencies.
4,Lo compre para usarloen mis viajes y en casa.Y entretenimiento.¡
4,Big upgrade from a 26-year old radio I use in the garage. Great for listening to sports while getting work done. I did not try to set the clock.
5,Sounds good and I can take it anywhere.
5,Love my radio. I use it in my home office!
5,This radio for its price point is a great bargain.  Works well tunes in hard to get stations and is nearly perfect for older people to use.
5,would buy again
5,Would buy again in a minute..
5,I installed 4 good “D” size batteries correctly into the back of the radio per the included instruction booklet.  Then I plugged-in the included 120V AC power cord into the side of the radio securely and then plugged the other end of the cord  into the 120V wall-outlet. Turned it on Nothing happened.  After a little trial & error it was noted that the batteries must be removed from the radio-back whenever the external power cord is installed into the radio-side (and vise-versa) never simultaneously.This nonstandard information needs to be clearly added to the radio operation instruction booklet. When powered up correctly this is an excellent radio.  Also a long-wire antenna clipped to the included antenna should help with shortwave radio reception and would also be helpful if included in the instruction booklet.
5,Buena señal el sonido le falta pero dentro de lo normal estoy satisfecho
5,It plays great in my work truck
5,Love it  Very easy to set up and Efficient on the Batteries too  Have been Using it 8 hours straight 5 days a week for 2 weeks now and the Batteries are still Good  Very Nice 👍
5,Wonderful portable radio.
5,I use it in a manufacturing plant. We have tried several radios but none could or would pickup FM stations very well at all.This unit I'm able to pickup FM without extending the antenna and it comes in Crystal clear. Works and sounds great.
5,I was worried I wouldn't be able to get good reception in my office building/room but this radio is perfect!  I pretty much only listen to one FM station (K-Love 93.3) but my second choice (The Bridge 95.7) also comes in great.  Tuning & volume knobs are so easy to use.
5,This radio is just what I expect from a good quality low-cost monophonic radio. And it runs on batteries too. It is not nor meant to be a BOOM Box. The sound quality on FM is sweet and pure.  I did not like the goofy way the clock is set.  Get one and just listen.  I don't believe you will be disappointed.
5,Best little radio I have ever owned
5,Been looking for a transiter radio for a long time but could not find one that had a decent sound and had digital tuning...this one had both!
5,Nice radio with easy setup and great reception
5,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my elderly neighbor. He has a hard time seeing hearing but he can listen and see the stations just fine with this.
5,Good radio everything works fine even the short wave. You can't ask for much more for the price. Sound quality volume and is very easy to use everything's great
1,not worth the prise
5,Perfect size for bringing to the beach!  Great sound as well.
2,My 30 year old gtx little radio sounds better then this. Don't recommend.. besides the sound quality I do like the radio if you purchase don't expect much from the "quality of the sound".
5,Sounds great thanks!
5,Good radio for the money used to listen to the traffic in the morning
4,I basically use an AM radio to listen to sports mainly baseball.  The digital tuner on this item works well as so far it is an upgrade from the manual one I used for years.
5,Unfortunately my mum returned this radio it was too big for the designated space!But it was a nice radio!
5,Husband's birthday gift.
5,Needed a little radio.  Plays clear good sound. Ideal for my needs
5,Perfect size. Easy to use. Great sound.
4,The digital tuning AC adapter and sound make this a good purchase.
4,Had a little interference from other stations but that may be because it was a Friday night on AM.  Seemed OK on Saturday morning.  On and off button could be more solid to turn.  A little loose too easy to adjust but not bad enough to matter.  All in all not bad for a small portable radio.  I would recommend it.
4,Volume control is extremely touchy. Static after using a few minutes. Have to move antenna & radio to constant new positions. Good speaker.
5,This radio has great sound and quality. A couple of steps up from the one I had in my office.
4,I had it with an old SONY that yelled static when I touched any of the knob.  This Greadio Portable radio is bare bones but of higher quality than I thought I would get in the $30 price point.  Good sound and the AC power cable will pay me back in weeks on batteries.  I did not want a pocket transistor radio.  This is a good size and actually pretty hefty with the batteries inside. In case you haven't noticed from the pictures or description the digit station is tuned in by a analog knob so you won't have to bust your fingertips changing stations while pressing little buttons.  I would recommend. I'm not sure the brand name makes any different as I saw it available by several sellers.  My wife yelled at me but I broke down and bout the 3 year service plan for less than $5.  You know how radios can be finicky.
5,It does everything I wanted it to do. The sound and tuning are absolutely great.
5,I bought this radio for an elderly relative based on reviews of best reception. It is easy to tune and has no interference from other devices in his apartment complex. Would definitely buy again.
5,Nice Radio...Good Price...I wanted to buy a Radio for outside when I'm doing things in my Shed....Rather then using my Music Head phones at times....
5,sw needs stronger antenna
5,Works great for a little radio at work. Use it at my desk.
5,nice radio.  serves its purpose.
5,Love the product  Highly recommend everybody buying this product
5,The initial radio had a LED display which would not illuminate adequately.  That made station changing a challenge.The seller was very courteous and promptly sent a replacement .  It works perfectly.I'm very appreciative that customer service is important to them and would not hesitate to buy from them again.
4,Could use a fine tune on SW. otherwise nice radio.
5,Needed a small radio for a rental home this radio works well.
1,Just static.  Threw it away.  Buy a Sangean for a little more money.
5,Great Quality Radio!
5,excellent reception. had recently purchased a radio-terrible reception. this radio far surpasses previous purchase. highly recommend this radio
5,This radio has a 3.5-inch speaker and enough wattage to drive it decently. The sound quality is also good.  The low (normal)/high switch can be set to 'high' to add clarity to voices and/or bring up the cymbals a bit.  Contrary to the opinion of another poster...I think that the tuning knob has plenty of turning space to allow for easy selection of a station.  As for sensitivity...I live in the Houston area and so we have a gazillion radio stations nearby.  My only downsides are 1) the clock is 24-hour only and 2) I don't need the SW band.
5,Good qualityeasy to carry!
5,Good product and it's easy to use.
5,Todo le trabaja es perfecto Calidad
5,This is a nice little radio.Good sound and volume.The extra long antennas work very well allowing us to hear the channels more clearly.Super easy to use and old school tuning sounds great!I haven't had a radio for years.
5,The radio is perfect for us because our car radio doesn’t work and we just plug this into the car the the cigarette lighter with an adapter. And it’s good in case of storms too. So we don’t run down our phone batteries. And it’s awesome for early mornings when I’m making breakfast and coffee because I like to listen to the early morning news in the kitchen.
5,Sound quality is pretty good. No preset buttons for faster changing of stations that I could see. Overall it’s a nice radio for the money.
5,Radio is good for outdoor.use. small enough to move it easily and big enough for good reception.
5,Great for kitchen top
5,Very excellent service and very high quality product.
5,Love the radio.  It will keep us posted during a hurricane or other storms that may hit Pensacola. Good sound not static and easy to set up
5,Very nice radio for the price. Sound is great for taking outside unlike my smaller am FM radios. The sensitivity is very good on all bands. I can pick up most FM stations without extending the whip antenna. My only criticism is that the tuning is faster than I would like but it is certainly usable if you tune slowly All in all I am happy with this radio and would buy it again.
5,Very impressive. I have a Sony and Panasonic that are comparable. This no name is just as good if not better. Tone control is nice and reception is excellent. Was able to hear many stations during the day. Selectivity was very good. Definitely a winner.
5,Love this adorable old school radio so much I bought a second one!  Dial is easy to use! You will love this radio! Highly recommend!
4,It’s a good little radio good reception but I didn’t realize it was a 24hr clock only.
2,son pas terrible réception non plus
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Excellent Radio I ordered on 23 August and delivery received on 1 September instead 13 September it's called fast delivery Radio awesome finishing very good very handy and light and voice is excellent quality awesome receiption very good FM in my area not good but AM SW very good receiption I found Minus thing is that seller do not provide cell costing Rs.80/ eventhough cost of Radio is Rs.10000/ It is pathetic. Radio DC power is 110 volt so you need voltage converter.Seller has to provide these things looking to high price of Radio.very nice radio I give 5 star and advise to go for this if you are in search of good radio
1,Bad productNo reception of even local stations in FM band
5,Très bonne qualité du son.Emploi facile visibilité des postes à gros affichage. Léger compact solide.Gros boutons simples à manipuler. Marche arrêt avec le bouton rotatif de volume sur le devantbouton rotatif de choix des postes sur le côté droit. L'antenne tient bien.Pas de superflu pour une utilisation simple de la radio AM/FM.Ne laissez pas de piles à l'intérieur non incluses pendant que vous voulez utiliser le courant fil inclus.J'ai des piles en réserve au cas d'une panne électrique je n'ai pas testé leur durée de vie utile.Frabell
5,Fue un regalo para una persona de tercera edad y esta muy contento con su radio lo puede sintonizar fácilmente.
