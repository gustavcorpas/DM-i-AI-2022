5,Not a bad laptop at all!  re. (2022 Windows 11 Laptop 15.6 inch 1920x1080 IPS Display Coolby 8GB DDR4 RAM / 256GB SSD Laptop Computers Intel J4125 Quad-Core Processor Notebook PC Support 2.4G/5G Hz WiFi BT Full Size Keyboard). I've been looking for a laptop for a couple of years but just couldn't get myself to pony up for a decent Dell at $800 - $1300. Ninty percent of the time I seem to use it for emails google searches YouTube GoogleDrive etc. It's nice that It also seems to run more resource intensive programs like Chief Architect Premier X13 without a problem. I wrote customer service just to test out to see if I'd even get a response and a human replied and was actually trying to be helpful. It seems important to them to keep the ratings high as they realize how important it is for a lesser known brand. I have no major complaints with the laptop. It came preloaded with Windows 11 Pro which was nice since Window 11 Home forces you to submit personal information and allows Microsoft to track and sell your data. Windows 11 pro can be done without that forced login. The internal speakers are not great so unless you are in a quiet area and you are at the laptop then you'll need to use a bluetooth speaker. For example if you are in the kitchen cooking and you have the laptop on the dining room table the internal speakers won't be quite enough to easily follow along a show. Mine didn't come with any obvious Windows 11 Pro Key so it would be wise for you to get the key from within the operating system and write it down somewhere for the day when you need to reinstall the operating system. That's not saying anything against the laptop it's just a reality of operating systems in general. There are third party apps that will help you get the Windows 11 key but I opted to dig into the registry to find it. If the folks at Coolby would include the Windows 11 key that would be a big plus especially for those that aren't so techno familiar. I like that it's silent since it doesn't have cooling fans. It also means that the likelihood of it lasting a long time is better too. During these summer months it does get warm on my thighs so if you actually have it in your lap like I often do plan on putting a board cooling lap stand or something between you and the computer. Oh one more nit pick the full keyboard is nice I really like the number pad. It does make the laptop go off it's center balance and instinctively I want to center the screen but that puts the center of the keyboard off to the left.  If it was on a table/desk  then the heat and the keyboard aren't an issue in my opinion. It might sound like I don't like the laptop but that's definitely not the case. I'm still thrilled with it and for the price! I've had a bunch of laptops over the years and this doesn't have any more idiosyncrasies than any of the others including a few that were above the $1k range. Overall I really like the laptop. To date it's best bang for the buck in a laptop I've bought.  I paid $276 for mine and I consider that to be a darned good price for what you get. The solid state drive is MUCH faster on bootup than a spinning drive and at this point you'd be making a mistake to get a main drive that isn't a SSD (solid state drive). So I can say that after using it every day for just over a month I'm happy to report that I'm happy.
5,So far so good.  It arrived quickly (1 day) well packed. I was looking for just a basic laptop to run financial software that doesn't run well on a Mac.  This one had the SSD and the RAM that was adequate. Light weight. Full keyboard which is awesome with financial software.I set it up. I love that it has Windows 11 Pro and not the hampered Home edition.So nice to be back to the old familiar interface instead of being forced to the Home edition.Haven't tried running much yet. Chrome is installed and I've been getting the windows 11 updates out of the way.So far it fits the bill -- both in terms of laptop itself and in terms of Windows 11 Pro.I haven't had any issues with the charger either.Note -- for those of you who came into the windows world for 8 and 10 - the Windows 11 Pro interface is more like the Windows 3 2000 through Windows 7 interfaces or Win NT. Yay!
5,I was headed out of town and needed a laptop. After searching around the Coolby seemed to fit the bill. I ordered one for about $350 and was a bit skeptical about its capabilitiesI'm very pleasantly surprised. It comes with Windows 11 installed. I  had a low cost offer ($40) for the Windows Office suite. Installation of this was a snap. I downloaded the Chrome browser and away I went!It works flawlessly. Surfing the net is no problem at all. Windows Office works with no issues except the computer won't work with Epson printers. I even called Epson tech support and they couldn't get it to work. But I switched to a Canon printer and everything's fineI don't know about long term reliability but for the money this is a great value
4,Es sumamente liviana y la definici√≥n en pantalla es buena. Su memoria de estado s√≥lido hace que los programas suban r√°pido.
5,My daughter wanted a laptop that looked and felt like the new surface laptops.  Being a high schooler she wanted to have a laptop that looked "fashionable" and not to heavy.  For us parents we wanted it to do  what was needed for school.  For the price we're all happy!
4,The lap top was great the charger didn‚Äôt work and seemed cheaply made. No option to just request a new charger. I sent it all back.
5,I needed a laptop with Windows 11. This laptop fits my needs
4,Nice size number keys on the side a plus thin and easy to set up. Feels a little heavy to me  and the battery doesn‚Äôt last too long but for the size and price it is a very nice laptop.
5,I will be honest I did not know anything about the makers of this laptop and I was apprehensive of both the quality and rather low price of this laptop but what I can say in short is I am surprised at how well this computer works. It does everything it advertises quality is great sound could be better as it is a little low but other than that as the title says it does the job well.
5,Using it for College super thin lightweight and good screen quality all for a reasonable price üëçüèæ
5,Works as described. Happy so far with it. It does need better instructions. The power supply can be plugged in to either side but the power is on the left. It seems to be a good value I do recommend it.
5,It came the time to replace my old sluggish laptop that I used for college. I was looking for something that didn't break the bank while also having a sleek design and is SD card compatible.I'm glad I decided to go with this Windows 11.  The resolution is great it's REALLY fast and super light for its size. The keys are very responsive and to my surprise it came with a simple charger that isn't huge and bulky. As for shipping it arrived quickly in only 2 days. I have Zero complaints about this laptop and I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for one. 10/10.
5,I've probably had five or six laptops in the past.  I've been using an older one and finally I just couldn't deal with the sluggishness of it especially comparing it to my new Dell large-screen desktop I've been using at home.  So I decided I would treat myself to a new laptop.  Considering myself frugal but at the same time knowing often we get what we pay for I did due diligence and researched the options available.  I'd never heard of the brand but after reading the specifications of the computer and the reviews I decided to give it a try.  And wow am I so glad I did.  I love it.  The combined ergonomics of the weight the touch pad and the thin package are perfect.  The screen is vibrant and the performance is sizzling.  I think it is a great product and would highly recommend it.
4,So i just needed something to replace my current 10 yr oldlaptop till i get a full desktop and this works pretty well. While the lack oh an HDMI port and only 2 usb ports is kind of a let down- and the space is half of what I had before but eh- Im satisfied with what I got. Plus being able to mess with the hard drive is a big pro considering many brands makw it as difficult as possible to even open your laptop up. But yeah so far so good
5,Received the laptop as expected quickly. Very easy to get everything up and running! Love it so far!
4,easy to set up and use. Well worth the price for normal home needs
5,So far so good.
5,Great bang for the buck
4,Reasonable price reliable after-sales service and sufficient performance for business or multimedia purposes
5,I used it for my children schools
5,Bought the computer it is great but it developed an issue I contacted the vendor and they immediately took care of the issue. Absolutely great experience I highly recommend this unit and you can feel assured they stand behind their product
5,compareable laptops cost twice as much.great quality!! they stand by their warranty..i own 2 of these. 6stars
5,I love everything about this laptop. It‚Äôs super fast lightweight and has good screen resolution.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†For the price of this laptop it's hard to beat. Has windows 11 and start up was a breeze. Runs very fast and smooth. The display is beautiful and has blue tooth so you can use wireless headphones and mouse pad. I love that it came with a number pad. Most laptops don't have that. Nice big touchpad. This laptop weighs about nothing and is super thin and slick. Got this primarily for 3d printing but I will probably use it for school and military work as well. Definitely recommend this if you're on a budget
5,Easy to set up.  Its a good computer for the money
3,I initially loved this computer. Graphics size layout..everything. I left it on the charger all night and woke up the next morning to a dying computer. It will not charge at all.
5,Was a bit surprised with the brand which I had never heard of (Coolby) but it's performed well thus far.
3,I was not happy due to two issues. While taking an exam that was being timed and recorded it simply turned off completely. It had full battery and I don‚Äôt understand why it happened. The other issue was that I would need to carry this laptop around for college classes and it was too heavy for me.

Great for a 2nd laptop for photo shoots and easy setup with 2.4 or 5 Wi-Fi.  Check out the video and see how cool it is.
5,System powers up into windows 11 very fast. Easy to setup and use
5,First day and the computer looks great and started right up.
5,It's a nice computer. Clean design. good performance
1,Update: the seller reached out first to offer a refund. It was beyond the 30 day return window so I hadn't asked for it but the seller offered. The total sum including the tax amount was processed back into my credit card. It hasn't posted yet but it was confirmed by Amazon. The Seller's proactive efforts to make the situation right is highly appreciated.I ordered on June 25. It is now August 22. The screen suddenly went black a week ago and hasn't come back. Return window closed on July 26. Charge light is blue and plugged in but the screen is black no matter what. I took it to a repair shop and they said it would cost $150 just to take a look.  Bought it for the low price but... consider getting a protection plan.
2,It died on me after only about two months.
5,Easy set up. My only complaint is the mouse pad is too large. I‚Äôll be adding a wireless mouse.
2,Can't  sign in or change password
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†video speaks for it's self
1,When you get this particular laptop everything about it *seems* fine. However one you want to make minor changes to your software (ie. audio codecs) you are pretty much SOL. Coolby support will not help you; re-installing (and uninstalling) will only make thing worse. That aspect isn't worth the waste of your time money internet research headaches and peace of mind.
1,The only positive thing is the light weight- within the first month the computer has failed- very disappointed
1,When the battery got low I plugged in the battery charger and it would not work. All so I had to take a test type the answers some of the keys were sticking.
1,I started off loving it but after about two hours it just stopped working
1,I am returning this laptop because it is not working
1,Out the box it had no power so plugged up to charge and still will not power on
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Just got It yesterday charged it went to work came home and the screen just doesn't turn on at all.
5,Very great for price
5,use it home and office
5,Very pleased with the computer and company.  It shipped and arrived ahead of schedule.  It is light weight easy to set up and I recommend to everyone!!  Amazing for the price!!
5,After some deliberation I took a chance on this and it‚Äôs everything they say it is!!
5,I've been very happy with the performance it has a great full size keyboard for typing and the processor never lags behind what I'm doing. Videos are sharp and colors crisp. Battery lasts all day and charges quickly. It's very lightweight and thin the metal case is very attractive to . I would highly recommend this notebook
5,Works great for the office!
5,So many features for a very reasonable cost! I'll recommend to anyone without reservations. Fast great keyboard excellent color and display options Wi-Fi and Bluetooth works flawlessly!
1,Purchased this for my elderly mom who needed something for Zoom calls. Unfortunately it's useless as there is no audio. I can't get any support and am stuck with a useless POS laptop!
1,OMG STAY AWAY ITS GARBAGE
1,Crashes to blue screen 4 times a day. Bought it for my child for school. Totally useless and is negativity impacting my kid's test results.
3,I have found the #6 key on the ten key pad seems to be off or broken. It doesn‚Äôt press down like the others and sometimes doesn‚Äôt work.Battery wasn‚Äôt the greatest. The trackpad got stuck sometimes or didn‚Äôt respond.
5,Me encanta  ! Es un excelente laptop calidad precio ! Seguir√© adquiriendo sus productos !
5,i really love this laptop. now if you been use to desktop like me and been a while since laptop or not at all. give it a chance and get use to the external mouses.  i really love it.  I'm hard of hearing so I have hard time hearing the music  but you will be fine.  i do suggest purchasing this PC.  it was set up and ready.  unlike what you read in reviews.  it does charge fine.  its beautiful and you will be happy you bought windows 11.  very good deal
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Initially while setting this up this felt like it was the laptop of my dreams! It was fast affordable great graphics great sound quality everything I was looking for. The speed was decent this the specs were great you name it.Then after only owning it for about 24 hours the screen glitched and completely went black from that point forward. No indication of overheating no excess heat felt no warning nothing. Attempted to recharge the batteries to see if that would help. Tried a soft and hard reset. No sign of life. This laptop pretty much turned itself into an overpriced Panini press. I am extremely disheartened and saddened that this laptop didn't even last 24 hours before it decided to die on its own.I would avoid purchasing this laptop and anything else by this manufacturer if I was in your spot. With my experience this is not a great indication of the quality that they claim they have. I hope that they can prove me wrong by correcting this scenario however it'll be a long time before I could ever trust them even after that.I am a former technician for various IT companies and I would strongly encourage you to look elsewhere before considering buying one of these beautiful looking laptops. Buyers remorse should not kick in this quickly.
5,I was hesitant initially to buy a laptop from a brand I didn't know...in the past I'd had HP Dell or other familiar brands but once I compared the specifications and prices I decided to give this a try.  I've been using this laptop daily for about a month now and I am happy to say that I've been very pleasantly surprised!!!  I really have no negatives to report at all.  The laptop performs exactly as expected and at a much better price that he more familiar brands.  The review made me rate "touch screen" but my model does not have touch screen.
