5,not sure how long they will hold up to heavy extension cords
5,No more hoses or extension cords in loose coils now they're all wrapped up and individually hanging from my rack system (different review).  No more tie wraps or other methods just use these to keep every hose/rope secure and in place

5,I originally purchased these for my many extension cords but wound up using these strong velcro straps to hold other items in my shed and garage.  This is no cheap strap very sturdy....I am using one to hold my string trimmer off the floor in my shed this is a quality strap.
5,We use the to tie together canopy’s and they work great!  Excellent product
5,Keeps my ext. cords neatly wrapped together & hung from my WallMaster hook (sold separately).
5,We have a few long and thick electrical cables as we have to use them for a generator and other outside work.  I was using 1 for an electrical rototiller and when I was trying to organize it to put it away was frustrated.  Looked on Amazon and found these so pleased.  So I then organized them all 3 very thick and unwieldy and a couple of others that are smaller.  Worked like a charm - these are the best.  Highly highly recommend.
5,Works as advertised.
5,We have alot of extra extension cord especially around xmas. These keep the Cords managed so they are easy to store restore and use regularly. Simple concept at a reasonable price.
5,Excellent garden/carpentry tools for a storage shed
5,These guys are good for:1. Ext Cords (I've got 5 on one strap -  It's a Versatile HD Storage Strap)2. Garden Hoses3. Rope/s4. Electrical Wire (I'm going to see if it will work on flashing - I hate how that stuff unwinds.Finally. You know how hard it is to find the release side of a velcro'd strap? If you don't have fingernails it's tough. These guys come with a loop pull that sticks out away from the velcro. Find the loop pull it. You just opened the strap.I'm impressed with this item.
5,I use these to store tow straps extension cords air hoses and more. Holds them together for easy storage on a hook with multiple items on the same hook.
4,Nice and sturdy but expensive for some Velcro. Does what you expect and is durable for home use not sure if use this in a shop.
5,Was exactly what I needed
5,easy to store electrical cords big and small
5,Looks professional and very sturdy. Makes hanging things in the van super easy
5,Hook and loop is plenty strong. Best method I’ve yet found fir cords and hoses. Seems durable but don’t know yet.
5,performed exactly as expected - large size allows for bigger extension cords.
5,Great for keeping multiple chords organized.  Can hang on a wall .
5,Easy to use and perfect for my use for extensions and hoses.
4,came in handy
5,Wouldn’t mind buying a few more. Great for a lot of things around the house
5,I bought these for a Purpose than most. 😻I can tell you they work great!!!!
4,This is a Christmas gift so I have not as of yet opened it. I have no reason to believe it will not be great!
5,I ordered a set of these to hang extension cords and cables in my garage. I only wish I would have done it sooner because these are a huge time saver and great for keeping things neat and organized. I paired these with a set of hooks (also bought on Amazon) and I can fit 5 cables/cords all coiled neatly with their own strap on a single hook.These are also made with what feels like very heavy-duty materials and the velcro / hook and loop is the high-quality variety that tends to last with repeated use and abuse. These are a great value for the price.
5,Very sturdy and well made. Tough!
4,Can't really judge their durability after a couple of weeks But they seem really sturdy and well made. I would buy them again or maybe a different size in the future.
5,I love these things for organizing all the cords that accumulated in the garage. I think they're such a great idea I bought more for gifts.
5,Perfect for all my needs.
5,Stores all my extension cords in my shed just fine. I have a few 100ft 12 gauge cords that are thick and heavy but these work great.
5,The Velcro holds time after time. They make it easy to hang from a hook without damaging a cord or hose.I will keep a few on hand just in case I have a need for them.
5,Love being able to wrap up a cord and quickly put these straps around them to hold and hang them.
5,Great storage straps for organizing and storing outdoor extension cords and other cords or hoses in the garage/basement.  They look great are made out of a very durable weaved material with strong hook and loop velcro that can withstand up to 50 pounds and help you organize your items very effectively and efficiently.  9 per pack....extremely affordable.  A++
5,My biggest concern was how sturdy they would be. But they are thick and constructed from good materials. I could see myself using them for a lot more than just cords.
5,I use these with extention cords and air lines mainly
5,Just what I needed for my cords! Strong velcro!
4,Great equipment but I did not have an option to actually buy other larger size and I found out with 50-100ft commercial extension that larger size is needed
5,This item is by far a very useful tool for organizing many things in your Man Town Tool Shed or Work Shop. For the ladies you are not left out. This works for many Lady needs.I purchased a set of six and quickly used them all to hang extention power cords power tools drills nailer air compressor hoses airless painting tools and more. Use your imagination. It is rugged and very useful. I liked them so much I purchased another set. I highly recommend this.Da P8NTRMAN
5,This extension cord holder is perfect for that use and just large enough for a 100 ft. electrical cord.  It should be useful for carrying as well as hanging the cord.To hold very loosely coiled (4 ft. diameter) 50ft. and 75ft. hoses required putting two of the cord holders together.  The hook and loop surfaces are large enough and two stick together effectively.  So for winter storage the hoses can hang from an interior wall.
5,I got these for my husband to use in the garage to organize the different extension cords. They are really simple to use you only have to roll up the cord and then place the strap around it. After putting them on the extension cords we then mounted some hooks to the wall and hung them through the loop. It has been a great solution to keep extension cords in order and taken care of. Would purchase again for sure.
5,Bought these for all the extension cords and some other stuff. Saves getting them all Tangled together while hanging up and just grab the top of the holder and you have what you were going for. Good product
5,Simple use to good power cords and hoses etc in a work van that’s constantly bouncing around all the time.  Great quality at a very reasonable price.
4,Product appears to be great and very sturdy. Only downside is that Amazon delivery person felt it was acceptable to cut 5 steps out of their time Me walk through the middle of my flower bed.
5,Absolutely  love. Made my basement  much neater and holds outdoor hoses in place and all my extension cords.
5,Easy fix to keep my extension cords from unraveling. Reduces twisting.
5,These straps took care of all my extension cords scattered around the garage: I just pounded a few more nails and cords hang neatly on the wall clearing up my small work bench. Velcro is very strong but it separates easily by pulling on a small pull tab.
5,Easy to use hang tools cords light hoses tow straps etc.
5,I’ve always done a good job of wrapping my extension cords but the smaller gauge wires would twist.  The Velcro set with these straps works great on my 100 foot extension cords.  The cords stay best and are easy to hang on the wall system I have for tools.  Solid deal.
5,Cords hoses cables tools - you name it - he loves em.
5,Really like their quality: they are sturdy and are a good size (I used them for 25-100ft extension cords).
4,Great for organizing chords. Material is thick and the felcro is very strong. Love the easy grab tab and gromets.  Would buy again
5,These things are heavy duty and the velcro is sewn in very well.  Good quality
5,I purchased several of these as I'm a big fan of velcro cable ties for my network audio and small appliance power cables and I am pleased to say that their big brother here works very well. I have a 50-foot heavy-duty heavy-gauge wire extension cord held by this and it works perfectly.  VERY happy with this purchase.
5,The velcro holds strong and the hanging grommet is a plus.  Perfect for extension cords.  I've also strapped a couple yard implement handles together in the garage so they stay together instead of sliding everywhere.  Pleased that there are several in the pack and I think these will be very handy.
5,I purchased these for my husband for Father's Day. He has been organizing his garage of chaos and these were great for organizing the mound of extension cords that he has collected. They have held some weight and are just very nice. He was also impressed with them. I would also purchase the ones that do not hang. They are great for putting at the bottom of the extenaion cords as well. He also uses them for his corded tools.
5,Works well to easily organize extension cords of varying lengths
5,Honestly bought these because I needed to hold up an electrical cord in my basement but Holy cow are they versatile! I used them to wrap up my garden hoses for winter storage some flex water line tubing a million things and these are amazing! They're lightweight but heavy duty and they can hold a 20 pound hose no problem! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! these were the best prime day purchase that I made
5,If you like to organize these are the way to go! They are strong and well made. Every garage needs them!
5,These are a quality extension cord holder at a great price. I wish I'd owned these years ago. They're a nice solution to keeping your extension cords organized and untangled with adjoining cords. The straps grommet and velcro all seem to be heavy duty for years of use.
5,Easy to use make tings a lot more organized…
5,I've tried all sorts of extension cord holders - many are large and ungainly. This Velcro style is the easiest. Price is right too. Quality construction. I'm sure they'll last for years.  Yep I'm happy!
5,These straps are perfect for organizing power cords which was my reason for purchasing them.  Instead of cutting through and replacing the zip ties I previously used for this job these are fast reusable and sturdy.
5,Works great and at a good price too!!
5,I thought I had ordered the small ones by mistake and that this size couldn't possibly hold up our thick outdoor extension cords. I was very wrong. This is the strongest velcro I have seen. I am very happy with my purchase. Wish I had more extension cords to hang up.
5,Wow!  These straps arrived today and look very strong and durable.  I am sure most people can think of many uses for them besides hanging extension cords.
5,Easy to use
5,Thrilled with how well they hold various sized cords/hoses. Great for the money
4,These are very strong. I don’t know if I got the right product. I thought it would hold heavy cords and hoses. Mine did not but there my be bigger ones. Description shows holding heavier items. Make sure you get what size you need.
5,Love these - could get addicted very easily!!
5,Excellent product for hanging my heavy 220V power cables.  The velcro strap easily holds 50 ibs cables and can be used for may different applications.  This product is much better better than cable spools making it faster to use and store extension cables.  I highly recommend this products to everyone to better organize your work area and garage.
5,These are GREAT! Not realizing until I purchased them that they’re not just useful on pegboards but strap around metal racking perfectly and securing with Velcro. Come in handy not just in the garage either - but in the shed a craft room even to hold together a ‘bunch’ of of coat hangers when not in use. These in particular are very well made.
5,Ok...this was a deal of the day.  But I liked them so much I bought a second set full price.  Very heavy duty and strong Velcro.  I normally use the plastics clamps for cords but these are easier to use can be hung up and don’t break.
5,Great heavy duty straps I have lots of them to hang cords hoses weed eaters shoveles small shop vacs electric drills saws etc. in the shed and garage. Highly recommend these.
5,I've bought various sizes of these velcro straps and use them for everything from extension cords to air compressor hoses.  All you have to do is drive a screw into a solid piece of wood and all of your cords and hoses will hang neatly.
5,The holders work as expected appear very durable and really help to clean up all my extension cords. I look forward to finding other uses for my remaining 6 (Bought the 9 pack)
5,The LuBanSir extension cord holder organizer is not a miracle product--it is a simple solution to a common problem--how to store large extension cords and small tools used around the property when the cords are not in use. This product helps to organize and store these things easily and neatly by providing a "handle" for hanging them up. Works well.
5,Very easy to use and durable
5,These straps are being used to hold various extension cords/air hoses/straps in our garage. They were the best price per unit at the time and quality wise have been good enough for the job.The stitching seems good and appear that they will last for a good long while.If they were still the best price per unit I would purchase these again.
5,Easy to figure out and use.
5,My husband has a snake hose for cleaning out drains. It’s quite long. He had it tied together with two strings. That’s for the birds. I used these Velcro straps in place of the strings. Made it so much easier to put back in storage after using these straps.
5,Easy to use velcro closure strap and made to last. Helps keep my extension cords and my garage organized.

5,Works so awesome on all my big expansion Correa and even will do my garden hoses.
5,Quality made product. They work great on any of my cords from a 12/3 x 100' long to small 8' long drop cord. Great for organization of all your cords.
5,These cord organizers were just what I needed for my RV hoses and outdoor extension cords. They are so much easier than those thin difficult bungie cords plus I can hang them up if I want. They are perfect! I've put several to good use so far. Highly recommended!
3,These are small. I have to use two for my hose. I have had better luck with bunny cords.
5,The product pick makes it look like it can hold more loops they what’s in it but that is about the max. That said if you get the closed it holds and it’s easy to hang. Like that you get more then one. Very happy with the purchase. Simple solution that works.
5,Finally have all the extension cords in my household untangled off the floors and no long impossible to find. I have these holding 25 ft heavy duty cords to 200 ft generic extensions cords these are great keep everything organized and no more tangled messes!
5,I don't know why I never knew about these. Makes hanging cords and just about anything that it can wrap around neater and easier to get to and use. I ended giving two to a friend and one to my brother because they loved them too. Will probably order more when I have time to continue clean up of garage.
5,Does exactly what you would expect.  Makes it easy to keeps cords neat and clean.
5,Leave the strap on a hook.  Pull down the front half of the strap put in the cord and cinch it closed.  I got large which was actually bigger than I needed for my electrical cords but they will come in handy anyway.  Impressive quality for the price.
5,I love these.  Using them to organize my garage and hung up three extension cords an air hose and my string trimmer.  I clip then to a hanging rack I have using carabiners.
5,I have a rural property and therefore more than my share of heavy 50 ft extension cords.  Now they are neatly hung up in the garage instead of a mess  and it was easy.  These are really durable with industrial style velcro.
5,cords cords cords: attachedstored  string lights as a strong hook!
5,Always had some issues keeping smaller cords ropes and stuff like that neat and organized after wrapping them up and hanging them on the hook / nail. This product keeps the cords  tight with the Velcro strap and the eyelet makes storage more compact and re-hanging them quick and easy.
5,I always had a home made system for my cables hoses ropes etc. These straps are the easiest to use. Super strong Velcro. Thick cordura. Very well made. Should last for years

5,Using to hang electric cords outside.

5,Works
5,works great on extension cords
5,Very helpful with organizing the garage.
5,This is one of those items that looks insignificant....until you buy it and realize your life could have been so much simpler this whole time. Simple and convenient way to store extension cords air hoses rope etc.  Had to use two to wrap around 100' of air hose but nothing worth complaining about.
5,Velcro is strong and it helps organize cords! Definitely recommend!
5,Product exceeded expectations. Working great for a variety of cords and hoses a few have actually been put to use holding up smaller leaf blowers allowing them to be stored on the walls. This might not be recommended but it's been a few months and they've held up so far.
5,I was impressed with the quality and thickness of these. I love the versatility of them. I used them to wrap some cords up and am going to use them to hold my fishing poles together too. I am going to order some more.
5,These work good to hand all kinds of stuff aside from cords.  Of course  they work great for cords too.

5,I purchased these to hang cords and collapsible hoses.  It was the perfect size for these but I could use a larger one for the 100ft. Cord.  The Velcro is strong and the hole to is large enough to easily hang it.
5,Never knew that you needed these until you get them.
5,I love these they are easy to use and they hold several cords or hoses or whatever you can fit inside. They are strong and can hold a good amount of weight in them.
4,Seems pretty small to hold my xtra long heavy duty extension cords and air compressor hoses. Guess it’s fine if your piddlin around with basic garage stuff but for a working company with large items don’t know how well they will hold up for how small the holding area is. Might have to put two together.
5,I'm going with the crowd and giving 5 stars.  I love these for cords hoses etc.  They are wide heavy duty and have a great hook and loop closure area.  The metal grommet makes hanging them on the wall a breeze.  Good product.
5,Work like expected.  Keep cords rolled up and are easy to hang on hooks around the garage.  Keeps the cords easily at hand and nice and neat.  They are easy to use as well.  And the velcro is very strong.  I have it holding a 200ft heavy gauge cord and it isn't sagging at all.

5,Used to hang extension cords in our shed...really durable and easy to use. Great space saver!
5,These are so much nicer than using zip ties and having to cut them all the time and then use new ones. These are reusable so in the long run much cheaper than buying more zip ties!
5,I will definitely be ordering more. These hold up my 35 lb RV cord easily. The weight of the cord actually broke the bracket off the wall before the strap gave way. These things are so easy to use and makes my life so much easier.
5,Great value.
5,Works great for ext. cords or whatever else you want to bundle. Feels durable. The velcro grabs and holds really well.

They are also being used to secure items like lawn chairs multiple boat cushions canoe wheels compound bow case etc. to the hooks on the wall in the garage.

5,Helps you stay organized and keeps things untangled.

4,I really like these but wish they were a big longer.  They work great for extension cords but i would love to be able to hang hoses with them for storage.  They are too short for this.

4,Convenient to use and clean up
5,They worked exactly how I needed him to work would highly recommend
5,It’s a length of woven vinyl with Velcro on it. You wrap it around cords or whatever. It keeps them from becoming tangled and makes it easier to unwind when you want to use it. Not rocket science. It works. I do not hang things by the metal button.  It’s too small.

1,Would not recommend
1,These were not as the description.  No way can this accommodate up to 12”.Bought these to wrangle pool hoses into submission. Too small. Return.
1,Heavy duty & great quality. Great for all my extension cords & air hoses
1,Buyer beware! This box was infested with maggots when we opened it up. Eeeewwwww.
5,These are great!! Velcro is strong enough to hold a heavy cord or several cords. I even put a compressor cord in one that I thought would be too big but it fit and held it
5,I use it to hold thick cables and it holds with ease
5,Bought these as a gift for my hubby's wood shop and he LOVES them! Sounds like he will get more as the need arises.
5,These things are so strong and versatile my whole garage is hanging on the walls!
5,liked it
5,Built a swinging cord and hose hanger and did great hanging up electrical cords/air hoses.
5,These work really well. They're probably bigger than you thought when they're fully spread open. They'll bundle up just about anything you're likely to carry. Worth the money.
5,These are very sturdy and easy to use.  I have 100ft extension cords for outside and these cord holders work very well.  I then just hang them on the wall and out of the way.  They do fit all sizes of cords.
5,Exactly what I was looking for.  Seem durable and now I can hang extension cords easier without unraveling
5,Exactly what I needed to organize all my extension cables
5,The cables in my garage have never been so organized. Very easy to use.
4,wish these were a little wider to put thicker and heavier extension cords in. They keep falling out

5,Works great
5,Christmas gift
5,Use primarily for power cords. Work as advertised. Just coil the cords and put this on to hold it. I usually plug the cord ends together so it doesn't tangle.Works great.
5,GREAT for ext cords air hoses ropes cables. etc.  If you have a nail hook anything this will allow you to hang them up.
5,I use it to keep my extension cords off the floor. The Velcro is secure and so far so good.
5,Finally an extension cord  organizer that works and is at a very fair price.
5,These straps are so useful to have. I use them for extension cords and also for garden hoses. They really help keep a storage shed tidy!
5,These holders are amazing. I wish I had found them sooner! I was able to reorganize our extension cords and free up so much room in storage. I have used them for other items as well like exercise tubes organizing wood stakes and more. These are amazing!
5,These are super handy and durable. I have left one with 4 pound bird feeder hanging off it all winter. No issues.  I think they are worth it and I would buy them again.  Make great gifts for anyone.  The velcro os wide and long and sturdy. Seems overall well made.
5,We use these for everything from holding cables to strapping bags together. The Velcro is high quality the straps themselves fell really good and strong.  Very well made and stitched clean.Great for organizing in cords.
5,I like these a lot! The Velcro holds very well. I will buying more
1,Delivery time was great. This is a gift for someone and I won't know anything about how they like it until after their birthday.
5,Great product
5,I’ve used on various extension cords it works on all cords including heavy ones.
5,I love these holders. I've wrapped garden hoses extension cords flex pipe etc. It keeps things neat prevents unraveling and tangles. I will be ordering more!
5,I got these for my husband's shop. Very sturdy and work great.
5,I bought these for my husband’s shop and he looooves them. Very durable and easy to use.
5,Well made Great Price!
5,These are doing exactly what I’d hoped. I have many bulky extension cords for my tools and holiday lights. These are keeping them tangle free. I’m getting my brother-in-law a pack.
5,After years of wrestling with extension cords these loops are the perfect answer to keep the cords neat and organized
5,These are a god send! As soon as I received them I wrapped my cords up and they look so much better in my garage. No more falling cords and was simple to use! And seem durable.
5,Bought these for the Neverending drop cords that seem to multiply in the garage.  They're proven to work for other stuff out there as well.  They work so well.  I may buy more for inside the house!!
5,Great for organizing hoses electric cords etc.
5,Fits even 100 ft extention cord. Very durable Easy velcro upen and close.
5,I was surprised to learn that one of these organizers can hold a 75 foot water hose with ease.
5,These are small like for small extension cords wire rope etc. But you can join 2 together to make them bigger. The velcro and nylon are strong. Individually too small for most camping gear but with 2 connected together they will hold electric cord short hoses etc.
5,I couldn't be happier. These are strong well made and AFFORDABLE. I'll be ordering more this week.
5,These are great for extension cords saws or other tools that can’t hang up on their own. I have a wall storage with hooks. I have used these to wrap the obvious extension cords but also saws and other power tools that aren’t easy to place on a hook.These are very heavy duty and easy to use. I 100% recommend these and will likely buying more in the future.
5,These are awesome. Had my extension cords here and there around my garage. Now all in a row on one wall. When our power goes out and happens more then we'd like we have to start the generator and grab cords. Now so easy. I bought wall hooks at the same time from Amazon. Made our life easier when we need a cord :)
5,by hanging an extension cord with this product you can hang more cords and etc. on less hooks.
5,I really like these and use them on every cord I have
3,Good design feels really cheaply made I doubt it will hold up to any abuse
5,Sturdy and good quality. Used for 50’ power extension cord and compressor hose.  Was not even looking for this product but found looking for garage organization products.  Really happy with purchase.
5,I use them to hang my heavy extension cords on the garage wall.
5,Not found a dislike  thus far!
4,Quick hook up or release. Easy to store away. Appear to be durable. Not only for the extension cords though you can wrap anything up and hang it.
5,good
5,💪
5,Terrific product. Low cost yet helped me organize  my storage area. Used it to hang up hoses extension cords and tools. Will be ordering another set but longer for larger diameter items.
5,Works great for hanging electric extension cords and air hoses
5,Finding all kinds of stuff to use them for
5,Perfect for all my cables and extensions. Durable too.
5,Good item for it's durability versatility and it's easy to use!
4,Pro: Space saving design and light weight compared to traditional cord wheels.Con:  Cords don't store quite as neatly in these as they do in traditional cord wheels.
5,One wordAwesome.
5,I was able to organize many of my extension cords air and water hoses then using peg board type accessories for easy access.
5,exelente
5,these straps are super easy to use and keep my numerous tangled chords easy to access.  should have ordered them a long time ago.  great product.
5,ended my cord storage woes in my shop
5,We have a racing family  and our race trailer had tons of cords EVERYWHERE  and no matter what we did they were always tied up in knots! These are easily adjustable for all different lengths and sizes and the cords don't tangle anymore!! And the reinforced hole makes them easy to hang anywhere!! We just bought a second set for our garage!
5,I ordered these for myself but my husband "borrowed" them and I guess I will order more. Very easy to use and very versitile.
5,I used these straps to tie up the cords behind my tv. They worked great.
5,Work great. Lots of uses.
5,Really like theses holders. Can hold a 100 ft #12 wire extension cord with no problem. Would recommend.
5,The quality of the straps was better than I have seen anywhere else. The velcro pads are thick strong and well attached. I was concerned about adequacy of the length to go around a cord but first trial it went around a 240 V 10 GA  25' feet long welder electrial extension cord with room to spare. I have previously used plastic U clips that break home made velcro straps that are too thin and inadequate. These straps are massive by comparison although short but sufficiently long enougn for my 50 ft 12 GA corrds and they do NOT come undone until you pull the velcro apart. A+
5,USING TO HOLD UP HOSE / R V WIRE IN MY RV
5,I love this product.  I have a workshop trailer and keeping the cords hung up would drive me crazy.  Every bump on the road would throw the cords off of my hooks and would then get tangled up from falling off.  The cords still slip off but they are not tangled anymore.  Great product.  Thank you.
5,these are amazing i bought it to hang my outdoor 100 ft expandable hose off a siding clip the velcro closure is super strong even with mud and water all over it! i Also used to wrap up my extentsion cords i am sure i will find more uses for these in the days to come and will order more! definately worth it!
5,Great product I have six extension cords from 25 feet to 100 feet. They secure them perfectly and the grommet is strong to place on pegboard.I have 2 that even secure my 25ft 50amp trailer cord with no issues.I would definitely buy more when need to.
4,This was an excellent product initially  purchased for about $17 When I tried to reorder the price had jumped to $46.Why?Totally unreasonable.
5,This is a quality product.  Heavy duty materials and the perfect size for ropes and Cords.  I’d get a larger size for any hoses.  I will be buying more of these.  It’s nice once in a while when you order from amazon and a really good quality item arrives.
5,These are extremely well-made and durable.  They grip strongly and can adjust to large or small bundles.  I highly recommend this product.
4,Good product but it is limited to a small length extension cord. My cord it about 70 feet long. When bundled up the Velcro straps don’t reach. It’s great for shorter ones though.
5,received the open the box and used them all might have to buy another set....
4,work very well so far just got them see how long they last. So far very happy with them.
5,Wow super pratique bien fait !  tout reste bien propre et accrocher.
5,These are currently being used in our travel trailer storage compartment to organize the hoses and keep them out of the way. We installed d-link hooks and put carabiner to hold them up.
1,These straps are WAY smaller than advertised. I needed them for by boat lines and they would not wrap around even the smaller ones.
5,Exactly as advertisedworks for electrical cords or hose
5,Arrived fast does what it is supposed to and doesn't cost much!
5,One of my best buy of the season I use all of them already and will surely buy more soon enough
4,Great sturdy durable  straps just not quite as large as I thought they would be.  Easy to use and really good for extension cords but not quite big enough for hoses.  But they will definitely come in handy.
5,Can hang extension cords compressor hoses and many more strong buit
5,Although nine straps are too many this is an excellent product.
4,Functional and they appear to be durable.
5,good quality and usueful
5,Looking forward to using
5,Really strong and easy to use.
5,Great Item works well
5,These were exactly what I needed to hang my power cords. Shared some with my father.
5,Great product
4,bon
5,Great product good price
5,As advertised perfect for keeping things organized in the garage.
5,Worked great from 6 foot cords to 100 foot cords
5,durability and quality
5,Great velcro strap for everyday use! We just love them. Get yours today! :)
5,Velcro is very strong and covers a large portion of the strap
5,Amazing to organize cords for water sports (waterski wakeboarding wakesurf...)
5,It was here when they said it would be and there was more then I thought in the order
5,I use this for extension cords and air hoses and It works great
5,Pour cadeau à mon conjoint très content et utile
5,Work as advertised
5,Bon rapport qualité prix
5,Excellent
5,Really useful
5,Great product great price!!
4,One of the straps broke unluckily it was the first one I tried holding two extension cords.  However the customer service made it right so its back up to 4 stars.I think it might have just been bad luck.  I tested the remaining 8 and pulled pretty hard and they seemed to be pretty strong.
5,they work perfectly and very strong and very well made solid material very well made and worth the invesment in purchasing them
5,Pour les fils d’extension et pour le suspende par la suite
5,The Velcro straps holds up my extension cords real good would buy again
5,Easy to use and holds well.  The velcro straps are solid and so far can hold my heavy hoses and electrical wire solidly
5,These extension cord holders are awesome. I’m a contractor who works with extension cords and air hose all the time on the job site these cord holders  help to keep things organized making transport and storage of cords and air hoses from unravelling when not needed. It makes things so much easier. They are easy to use and  durable. The company ships items out quickly.  Wish I would of found these sooner. They have so many uses I ordered another set.
4,Near and quick to hang tools and cords up out of the way and organized
5,I liked these so much I ended up getting more. I also recommended them to my mom and she liked them so much she ordered more. I have an injured arm and was still able to use these straps one handed. I now have all my shop extension cords and garden hoses neatly corralled. I also love the fact they have a grommet on them which allows me to hang them up on hooks to store the items up out of the way. I definitely recommend these straps. Only suggestion is they should add either s hooks or garage hooks as a buy with item suggestion.
5,ca fait bien la job ! surtout pour les rallonges électrique . et hose de la machine a pression et meme le compresseur a air !
5,Amazing product I use to bundle welding cable on my truck holds 100lbs of cable hanging from the eyelets no problem
5,Great product. I use this to organize cords hoses and safety gear in the van. I will probably end up with more.
5,Liked that it is easy to use. I used it to store extension cords
5,This product is so simple and serves the purpose very well.  I will buy more one I get the garage organized
5,It is an excellent product.
5,Worked exactly as i wanted
5,Price is great and really cleans up the corded clutter. Time will tell how they hold up but the large size will hold 100 feet of 14/3 cord. They look good quality and Velcro really holds firm.
5,It is as good as in the picture and easy to use
