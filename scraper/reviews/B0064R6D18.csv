4,I bought this for my 100’ of 1.5” flat backwash hose. One reviewer said it fit great for 2”. There is no way they are fitting 100’ of any backwash hose on here. I do think this product would work great for it’s intended use.
4,Bought this to hold Fiber HDMI cable --- it works but the small handle makes is odd to wind up.  Overall good buy based on price
4,Nice reel it can hold up a 100 ft. extension cord easily
4,Assembly was very easy with no tools required. After you snap together the two halves of the reel make sure the black plastic nut that holds the halves together is secure.In my case I had two 50’ heavy duty 12AWG extensions connected together - one bright yellow the other bright red. As the picture shows all 100’ fit on the reel barely.A few observations:These extensions are much heavier than 14 or 16 AWG Just one of the cords is pretty easy to handle but with both the reel gets pretty hard to turn and it starts to feel flimsy because the cord weighs more than the reel!Also keep in mind that the connectors are not  small so connected extensions will take up reel capacity that a single cord won’t.I’ll probably use this reel for a single 100’ 16AWG extension which is currently just coiled up.  For the 12AWG extensions I’m going to have a separate reel for each of the 50’ cords.The only reason I bought 12AWG extensions was the fact that I have an electric de-thatcher which pulls up to 13 amps.BOTTOM LINE:  excellent choice for 14/16AWG extensions particularly shorter lengths. Much sturdier than the “all plastic” ones.
4,I usually don’t review products without some “time tested” experience but my only concern in ordering this product was whether or not I could use this reel to manage 100 feet of 12 gauge extension cord that I recently bought for my Greenworks snowblower.  The answer is yes it rolled up within the diameter of the the reel spool by winding it up fairly neatly.  It was hard for me to find a reel on-line that promised to hold 100’ of heavy-duty extension cord without dropping a lot of coin; and I didn’t need a heavy duty reel with 4 outlets on the side since I’ll need the “unwinding end” of the cord to be the female connector; and I didn’t need a reel that was essentially an extendable outlet box.  But I’d read some vague or conflicting info on this site regarding what this reel can hold; and when it arrived I found a hang-tag that says “HOLDS 100 FT OF 14 GAUGE CORD”.  So the Mfr is not recommending 100’ of 12 gauge; but if you’re using it for the occasional light-duty home use like me I think it will be adequate for 100’ of 12/3 cord for relatively light-duty service.  It’s a lightweight construction but I do think it will fit my needs; and one should not expect more at this very affordable price.  My 2 cents.
4,As with others I got 100' of 12/3 cord on the spool with a bit hanging to the side for convenience.The frame being metal seems sturdy enough with the plastic spool being less than desirable for long-term durability.I'd happily pay a bit extra if the entire unit were made of metal but I don't see anything like that on AMZ.
4,Strangely this does not come fully assembled probably for packing purposes. It comes unboxed inside an Amazon box but you must remove two clips which is easy enough but then you must invert and snap two pieces of the reel together. Unless you have amazing arm strength plan on pressing one side to the floor while pressing the other side with your hands.  Then plan on never undoing this because it's a super tight fit. It's worth it because it seems durable free standing with a comfortable handle to carry and move and will finally end the nightmare of a tangled and kinked cord. However if you are starting with a badly kinked cord that has been that way for a long time plan on doing some serious work getting it wound.  Then if continually wound back on the reel after use the kinks should smooth out with time.  If your kinks are so bad that you can barely straighten the cord with your bare hands consider buying a new cord.  After being wound pulling on the cord straight it should come off the reel.  You may need to hold the handle to keep it steady depending on how kinked the cord is.  Also winding the cord back on the reel after each use will still be a bit of a chore but it's the only way to keep it from kinking so it should be worth it. Woods is a famous brand for extension cords so they should be able to make a worthwhile storage solution for such a product and this may just be it.
4,I don't know why people aren't looking at the photos.  The reel is all plastic on the metal frame.The plastic hooks to hold my cord in place was way too tight for a 12 gauge so I had to cut them off.The design isn't the best but it works great for holding my extension cord.  I had to make adjustments so I have 2 feet of cord at the male end.The trick to reel in a long 100ft 12/3  cord is to hold the frame with your foot so one hand can turn the reel and the other to guide the cord to the right spot.
5,I bought one for my 100 ft extension cord and one for my 50 ft.  It's so much easier and neater than trying to roll them up by hand.  I thought I'd struggle to get the 100 ft on and figured it would be falling off the edge once rolled completely up but it's perfect.If I get more extension cords I'll definitely buy another one of these reels.
5,Works
4,It held my 100 extension cord. One cord was a 12 gauge 100' it was a little tight and the second one was a 14 gauge which worked with no problems. you need help guide the wire so it spreads evenly but for the price it works for what I need it to do.
3,My previous Cord Reel was one of the ubiquitous orange plastic type.  Mine has K-100 molded into the plastic.  The handle on it broke when it fell about four feet to a concrete floor.  I was looking for something a little nicer.As many reviewers point out the tubing in the stand for this product is metal (seemingly plenty stiff and sturdy for the easy task) but the reel cord clips and turning handle are all plastic.  While the plastic seems adequate to task by direct comparison the reel side plastic seems slightly more flexible and no sturdier than my orange reel.As to capacity this will vary by brand (not all 14/3 cord has the same exterior dimension).  My cord is 100 feet of Romex brand (yellow jacketed) 14/3.  It fit my orange reel with a little room to spare.  This Woods 22849 has the reel edges a bit farther apart but the reel exterior diameter is a bit less than the orange.  When I wound the Romex on I had about as much spare room as on the orange reel.  Possibly I was a bit sloppier at getting the cord on so if I did better there would be more room.  If you are calibrated to the orange reels I suggest you plan that this one has about the same total capacity just wider and less deep.Unlike others who found the clips unsuitable I thought the one I used to moor the mid-point of my cable did just fine.  I like that there is a second so if I break the first I still have something.For the first time on a cable reel I am following the advice of many reviewers here to double over the cord clip the midpoint into the reel and roll along so you have both ends available unrolling only what you need.  This works.  However the people advocating this method should all warn you:  THIS IS FORBIDDEN BY THE MANUFACTURER.  Both the K-100 orange reel and this Woods 22849 carry sidewall instruction telling you to unreel the full cord length before use.  The reason is safety.  The mechanism is heat.  For ANY extension cord failure to extend it means the heat rise in the conductor coming from the load current interacting with the conductor resistance will make it hotter as the heat has a poorer escape path.  This in turn lowers the maximum safe current.  As I am powering a modest line trimmer which runs intermittently I believe myself to be safe.  If you are running a space heater or other device which consumes a lot of power don't do this.  If in doubt put your hand to the stacked-up cord after your setup has run for a while.  If it has warmed up noticeably beware.
3,The design flaw is how to avoid injury during the winding. Either plug will whip around and strike your forearms on either side. A small improvement would be a second ring independent of the main body that would freewheel allowing it to remain stable.. While the main  body turns it could catch the stable end against your forearm striking only once as opposed to lashing you with each revolution. The plug whipping around can be quite painful to the arm if you wind normally. Unfortunately I do not expect manufacturers to see this suggestion. The sellers are distributors not designers and merely sell what they can buy. Perhaps I should paten my design ideas???I have thought of a solution; Take the end of the cord thread it through one of the openings from the inside of the reel to the outside of the base leaving enough length to tie it around your wrist like a bracelet. Thus moving the plug with your arm which would avoid the whipping motion keeping the end stable and allowing you to wind the cord at what speed you find comfortable. A bit convoluted but I maintain it's better than being whipped by the cord ends.
5,I have a 100ft 14 gauge cord in mine there is room for more especially if you rewind carefully in layers
5,Easy to use and hold well
4,Had a plastic one.when broke i thought i try this item. Happy i did much better than the so-called cheaper one. Well this one was cheaper and works better than the other.
5,How sturdy the wheel is after assembly and ease of extension cord release when needed.
5,Smaller than I expected but it is very well made and was exactly what I needed. Fits my 100 foot extension cord perfectly and is still small and light to move around easily. I wish they made a bigger one for my bigger gauge cords.
5,I have a 50' very good (flexible) pressure washer hose and wanted to just roll-it-up vs having to coil it up and store it with the pressure washer.I seen that people were able to use this woods cord reel with 50+ feet of 12-awg extension cords so I figured that it should be big enough for my: UBERFLEX Kink Resistant Pressure Washer Hose 1/4" x 50' with quick connects.IT WORKS GREAT FOR MY APPLICATION.
4,This is a great compact sturdy cord reel. The one flaw is that the reel knob completely broke off after just a few uses. I wish that part was metal and more durable.
5,It was inexpensive and works well.  It is the go to item I use when I expect to use the entire length of a power cord (for example when using the leaf blower.)One thing to mention is that if there is still cord on the reel a short extension cable is needed to plug into the wall since the end will still be wrapped up.  This is to be expected with this design so it is not an unexpected draw back.Also the cord cutouts on the reel are tight for thicker than normal power cords (12 AWG).  I'm sure it is fine for the common 16 AWG power cords.  Since the reel is plastic it is easily addressed with a Dremel.Happy with the purchase.
4,This reel is sturdy because of the metal stand.I’m having difficulty with the “easy snap on” part. It is not snapping on. Any suggestions?
4,I used the reel to wind up a 10 gage heavy duty extension cord. The cord is 50 feet long & measures 9/16 outside dia. The reel held the complete length. I put the female end of the cord thru the slots on the reel & zip tied the plug to the reel. Seems to work ok. Time will tell. I attached a photo.
5,I got this to keep my extension cord from kinking. I use an 80 foot cord for my gardening needs. This reel stand handles it beautifully and keeps the cord in perfect condition! Highly recommend….
4,The other reviews were very helpful. I cut a hole in the inner hub and did some additional shaping with a Dremel tool so the male end could be fed through. The plastic cut very easily. I had self-adhesive hooks made to retain wires under a desk. I did have to cut those off a little with metal shears. I cleaned the 3 locations on the hub first with a solvent and they really stuck well. It would have been nice had the manufacturer done these modifications first because you really can't use it without them. But I'm pretty experienced doing these things and have a lot of tools. so it only took about 20 minutes and now it's great and easily accommodated the 100' extension cord.
4,So quick and easy to roll up my flat garden hose. Conveniently stored away.
4,Worked for 100' extension cord
5,This is a great sturdy product. I am an electrician. In construction all my tools take a beating and this tool is no different. Good quality. Holds up to the job.Alot of people talk about having to make holes in the center to pass the cord end thru. I haven't had to do that. A bit of creativity in the way you coil your cord you can leave the product intact and still be able to use the end even when the cord is still on the reel; helping with maintaining the integrity of the reel.I recommend it to anyone looking for a cord reel. BUT  just know that there are very similar products in our local “Lows” and “House Depot” to save you the shipping cost and the dreaded wait time…
4,I realy like this cord reel it makes things easier and portable.
4,The good is that it in inexpensive. It will hold 100' of electrical extension cord easy and that it is easy to pay in and out.The bad yes it is mostly plastic but that this not necessarily negative but definitely not for rough use.  If you're going to be using the extension cord every weekend and paying out a lot of it I can see this breaking on you in some way before you believe you have your money's worth out of it.If you are looking to just store an extension that you rarely use you'll be pleased.  If you're looking to throw this thing in your shed or bed of your truck and it will work every time for years nope....
3,This reel is definitely lightweight.  The frame may be lightweight steel but everything else is lightweight plastic.  It's near impossible to wind up a 100' Extension cord due to this reel flopping all over the place while trying to wind the cord.  I literally have to hold the thing down with my foot while winding the cord.
4,Just allows me to get 100ft 12 gauge extension on reel.
4,Don't go more than 100ft.  It does the job nothing special but seems like it will last a bit longer than the orange plastic ones.
2,If you plan on putting any amount of anything on it you better run zip ties or wire to keep the wheel from unsnapping/coming apart. If you do this it will stay together.
3,It does not work as it is supposed to do. You need to drill a hole in the middle pas the cord thru that and then use it. Watch some videos on YouTube before buying this product
4,Everything about this reel is better than our previous cheap plastic crap.  The frame is metal but everything else on this is plastic.  But it doesn't feel cheap and flimsy.  I have a 100' foot cord on it and I'm sure it could handle 150' though not more.  There is a larger opening on the side if you want to roll up from the male end and have the plug sticking out.  That's what we do have the male end sticking out a few inches then attach it to an outlet with another shorter extension cord.  I know many people roll up cords from halfway but I prefer to be able to wind and unwind length as I need it.The one potential negative of this reel is the small poorly attached winding handle.  You can't even really call it a handle it's just a very short (maybe 1.5 inches) stub of plastic you use to wind in the cord.  It is just attached with 4 small tabs and it looks like one smack of this handle on something will break off at least one of the tabs.  If the handle comes off this reel will be pretty useless as winding in the cord would be a pain.  If it does snap off I will update my review.
4,the center hub likes to come apart no matter how much you tighten it. wish this was metal instead of plasticfine for occasional home use but not for daily work
2,There is a plastic securing washer that falls off after the wheel spins rending the entire spoiling mechanism ineffective.  The roll falls off of the stand as a result.  I wouldn’t buy this again.
1,I had high hopes for this cord reel winder unit. With use these high hopes were dashed. The unit was easy to put together but it was a goat rope to wind the cord in it. After filing the space about half full it was so cumbersome to use that I quit. There is a need for a product like this but someone needs to develop one that is readily easy to wind the cord and hold the amount of cord that is advertised. Like with another product I reviewed there is something wrong with a cord winding product when it is twice as fast and easy to simply run the cord between my arm and hand than use the product. I just also threw this in the trash. I was so disgusted with it that I did not even want to bother returning it.
3,The plastic nut in the center of the wheel that holds it onto the frame came loose. I tried to reseat it but it did not go on all the way and now the wheel wobbles.
4,The only thing what i would change is a hole for the cable end to use it like an outlet
3,I replace the exact same reel that had fallen off a step and cracked its plastic axle. Upon receiving the new one I noticed the side hole cover was left off unlike the original- I was able to put my old cover on but it struck me as odd that its just a way they'll save money to simply no longer provide the cover
3,Held all the cord it said it would. Two lightweight in my opinion as it falls over when the cord is unrealing
4,Came with no retainer screw. Not interested in wasting time and money returning. Improvised. Used screw to from plastic coke bottle.
5,Bought this for my 100ft exstension cord & wow so much easier to use. No more arm wraping & removing knots/tangled wire. Quick & easy
4,I have two fifty foot air hoses and was looking for something to keep them on to keep them organized and easy to handle.  I chose this one because I wanted to be able to attach one end to a compressor and only unwind as much as I needed. Kind of like how they are at gas stations.  the descriptions said 150 ft and some other numbers that didn't make any sense to me but I figured what the heck i'll give it a try.  long story short I was able to fit fifty feet of 3/8 inch air hose on it.  the round part is not a heavy duty plastic so im not sure how durable that will be.  the base and handle are metal but not a super thick metal.  the whole thing weighs about a pound or two.  not sure if I will be able to use it like I was intending but as long as its keeping  my air hose neat and out of the way im happy with it. I only need to buy another one for the other fifty feet I have but that is my fault for not understand the gauge numbers before I bought this one.  i'm still happy with this purchase.
3,I was leary to buy this for my 100ft 10/3 cord as you see in the pictures it doesn't work out. However I will keep it for my 50foot 12/3 cord and it will be fine for that.
5,I use a stationary oxygen concentrator at home with 50 ft. of tubing and a 7ft. cannula. It's often spread across the floor where it's in way for my family me and the dog. I purchased the item below on Amazon and it seems to be the solution. I can quickly wind or unwind the hose so it's out of the way when not needed.Price was reasonable and quality seems pretty good for plastic.Some tips on its use:- the interior of the wind up reel has two plastic hooks one on each side of the reel. Mark the midpoint of your tubing with a piece of tape and loop the tube on the hook at the midpoint before winding. Since the two halves will now wind up simultaneously guide them with your free hand while you wind. Doing this prevents the tubing from catching on the hook on the opposite side of the reel. The tubing only needs to be attached to the hook on one side to wind up.- since putting the midpoint of the tubing on the hook does cause it to kink I do plan to buy a curved metal guide (often used for ropes) to prevent kinking at the midpoint. It provides a smooth kink-free path for the tubing and can be put around the plastic hook.- to unwind hand pull out both halves the tubing together. I keep the half that connects to the concentrator plugged in and the cannula end hanging on a hook I put on the concentrator.
5,Excellent quality very strong
5,This item was EXACTLY what I've been looking for!  It's very durable and has replaced two older "plastic" versions of a similar product.Thanks Guys!Ed
3,It’s a bit flimsy. One piece pops off with each use. It works but it is cheaply made.
5,Fits a 12g 15A 100ft cord easily (yellow). Also fits a 16g 13A 100ft (orange). Can't beat the quality for the price. To get bigger/better you have to spend twice the cost.
3,Just ok for 100ft cord probably wouldn't buy again
5,lite weight  good price  perfect
2,The Woods 22849 Metal Extension Cord Reel Stand In Black Heavy Duty Quick Snap Together Design is ease to put together but it also comes break apart when you are using it. The stand is metal but where the cord goes/ wrapped is plastic & that what on you come a part a lot. Would not buy this stand again.
4,I like this.  Reduced one star because it does seem like it would break pretty easy.  Other reviews mention the plastic breaking when cold.  But I plan on buying more of them and hope they last.  Easy to rollup.  Place foot on base to help with this.  I also tried the trick I read in a review where you put the middle of the cord at the start so both ends get unrolled and you only pull out what you need.
4,Mine arrived and required minimal assembly. The reel itself is made of plastic but does not feel like it will break anytime soon. I quickly wrapped 100ft of outdoor extension cable. There are better reels out there that are made of steel but they are also way more expensive. As long as you place your foot or hand on the base of this reel it will stay still when you are reeling. If you can't or don't want to do this avoid this reel and buy a steel one.Some buyers have written that they not fans of the wrap design but this is standard. You find the middle of your cable and hook it to a small hook built into the reel. You then wind the reel until the cable is fully wrapped resulting in the 2 ends being the last parts to wrap - making them both easily accessible. When you are ready to use it you plug in the one end and walk the reel half way to your destination.
5,I used this for a 50 foot 12 gauge extension cord. It fits on with room to spare. I like a little notches built into the side to hold on to the cord. I also found that it whines and unwind very smoothly. I choose to leave the reel by the outlet And pull the cord to where I need. The metal base makes all the difference as it keeps the stand from falling over and it stays in place to when pulling out the cord. I appreciate that the knob rotates so I can just grab it and wind the cord back up.I think for lightweight Use this is an excellent product for the price and I'm quite pleased with it
3,It was like working with tin not heavy metal. Tried to put extension cord on and could not hold up to weight. A waste of money and time!
4,The reel works very well and the base is sturdy. However the side handle that reels up the cord is easily broken if tossed around at all. Once the handle is broken the unit is pretty useless although Im working on a fix. Just be careful with the reel and you should be fine.
5,I bought this for my husband who tends to leave the extension cords strung out everywhere when he's finished using it.  After tripping over the darn thing for a week I bought this extension cord reel and OMG!!  Best thing since sliced bread.The extension cord was loaded easier onto the reel.  It easily held all 100 ft of cord.  It is light weight and compact so even I can move it out of the way without a struggle.  I would recommend this for any husband boyfriend or just any person who has use for a super long extension cord.  T
4,I bought a 150 foot extension cord a while back. I found it in the laundry room with 15 knots in it and about 18 other wires wrapped within its clutches. Because it weighed so much and I couldn't imagine untangling it I hardly ever used it. Along came this reel to give an old extension cord a new lease on life.I spend an hour or so untangling the cord and then put it on this reel and now it's my favorite one. I have used it to simply extend things a few feet or 100. And when I use it I feel all strong and manly and professional. I plug in one end and then pull the stand to wherever I need power and set it down. I swear that the guy who installed my furnace gave me an approving nod when I brought it to him though my wife says he wasn't even looking. Either way I felt good about it.So for those of you with a 100+ foot extension cord around and nothing to put it on I recommend this product.
5,Bought this to hold my 100 ft small extension cord so far so good winds up easily and is lightweight. I would not recommend to heavy duty use.
5,I would not recommend this product to anyone the nut that holds the wheel on is missing now it popped off I only used it twice very cheaply made
3,the wheel comes in two pieces and has to be snapped together to complete install. This is very easy to do. However I took this opportunity to place the free half in a vise and used a hole drill bit to drill a hole in the flat spindle to push the prong side of my 100ft extension cord thru it so I can plug it in without unrolling the entire cord for use.  Works great but understand this is a $10  reel and the only metal part is the handle holding the wheel .
3,It's not all metal the spool is plastic!
3,Description says metal and leads you to believe the product is metal. Its mostly plastic.
2,When it works it's ok.  Yes the product title says metal yet it's actually nearly all plastic.  That's not what bothers me it's if you get a bit distracted while winding up the cord or wind it up a little too fast and the cord goes between the metal stand and the plastic reel you're staring at a good 10-15 minutes of fighting to get the cord untangled and freed up so you can continue rolling it in.  A complete waste of time and many colorful words have been directed at this product.  Would not buy again.
5,I can confirm this reel definitely holds 100 feet of 12/3 heavy duty extension cord.
5,Seems durable yet light.  Easy to carry the extension cord around.
5,hose 50 ft. Is the max with this and it fits right on top of the sun jo washer .... ordering 2 more for the road
3,A little more difficult to put together than I thought it should be.  The knob holding the reel on the shaft broke during the 2nd use.My son broke it when I wasn't there to see how he handled it so I didn't return it.  Still I'd want something like this to not need to be treated gently.So for that it doesn't get the "sturdiness" vote from me.  I'll figure out a way to fix it (probably epoxy).
5,This is a great design holds my 100' extension cord with space to spare.  Operates good and the price was just right!  Thank you!
5,Assembley was straightforward - remove the clips and snap the 2 halves of the spool together and it is good to go. The frame is sturdy and the spool was able to take in a100 ft 14 gaughe extension cord (see picture). With the weight of the extension cable the spool still spins smoothly. I wish the crank knob was a little larger. Perhaps that is something easy to modify. Also thinking of mounting this onto a piece of playwood to increase the stablity.
2,Not thrilled with this reel at all.It holds my 100 ft 12 gauge cord just fine when zip-tied to the reel in the middle but the actual reeling activity both in and out is about as annoying as it gets.  I use this for an electric mower so I roll it out and reel it back in every week. There are two hooks in the middle of the reel that are supposed to catch and hold the cord to either side so you can reel it in. They looked flimsy so I used zip ties as well. They still snapped off the 2nd week. No big deal just figured they'd last a couple months at least but man 2 weeks?  That's junk.What I really hate about the reel is the plastic nut holding the reel to the frame.  You have to real clockwise to keep the nut on otherwise it falls off mid-way and you have a roll of cord to straighten back out.  It's only 1/2" thick and made of the same flimsy plastic as the reel. It's a nut...with threads...so how they thought plastic would do on a component this active I've no idea. Once the nut or the threads it attaches to strips it'll be useless which I'm guessing will be very soon.For $15 I can't complain much but when an object can sufficiently perform the duties for which it was created 2 stars. If you plan to use the reel for storing a cord you occasionally use it'll be fine.  If you use it weekly like me this is way too cheap and junky to support you I suggest you spend a bit more and look elsewhere.
4,Very light weight...so much so that initial winding is a little unwieldy. However it does a good job storing my longest outdoor extension cord making it all the more accessible and easy to put away.
4,Works well. Only complaint is that the short handle is a bit annoying when you reel in the cord. If the handle was a little bigger I'd give it a five star.
4,My parents had an orange Bayco cord reel that I would always use when it was time to unravel the extension cord but I always felt there could be improvements made to it... then I came across this Woods model.  The picture makes it seem rather large but it's really the perfect size to hold 100 feet of 16/3 cable.  One thing I like about this is I can put my foot on the base while winding it up and there's plenty of clearance between my foot and the flange (was always a problem with the Bayco). My only issue with it is there's no extra flange on the side to wrap a foot or so of the opposite end of the cord so it can easily be accessed when you only need to unravel like 20 feet of cord and still plug in the other end. I believe other manufacturers have this feature but I haven't been able to come across any "affordable" models under $30.
4,This cord reel is fine--pretty good for about $13. There's a notch in both plates to position cord plugs. Nice metal frame though the plates are plastic. On the handle is a hard plastic grip (was hoping it would be a sort of rubber grip).  The advertised "holds up to 150-feet 16/3 AWG" is over-stated. Yeah maybe if you tediously wound the cord nice and even and somewhat tight around the drum but either you need a third hand to do that or you'd have to place it on the ground putting a foot on the base and wind accordingly. I have a standard 100-ft 16/3 cord wrapped on mine and it comes right up to the top leaving very little room for any more. The knob on the plate that turns the drum/plates seems rather flimsy though. In time that will probably be a hardware store fix. All in all good for the money though.
3,I have two of the orange cable reels this one is metal so I thought I'd give it a try.  the hooks to secure the cable are not well engineered and the cable cable ties string twist ties kept slipping off. eventually I did a through hole on the side and tied the mid section of the cable securely.(if you didn't see in other reviews find the midpoint of your cord attach that to the reel and reel in leaving both ends accessible.the spool is smaller and less rigid than my two "orange reels" but seems to do the job on on 100' extension cord. The reels on the orange reels are a bit larger in diameter.  Overall this unit is a bit smaller than the orange units and was harder to put a foot on the base and reel in 100' of extension cord. You will have to help feed the cord onto this reel.  It works and seems to do the job once I overcame the poorly designed cable hooks. If I have to replace it I'll go with the orange ones next time.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Parts missing. Otherwise it would be fabulous.
3,This was the second extension cord reel I purchased. The first one has been great. Works as it should. I ordered a second reel and this one arrived missing the spindle nut that would hold the reel onto the stand. I am returning this one and Amazon is sending a replacement. Hopefully this one will be complete.
5,I ordered and returned a few reels before finding this one. Essentially I needed something wide enough for the flatten backwash hose and deep enough to hold 100 feet of the hose on the reel. This is wider than it needs to be but that's okay!I'm ecstatic! Rolling up this hose used to take ten minutes. Now it takes 30-45 seconds!
4,I am using this product from last 2 months. Everytime when I rollback the cable problem is with the first end. Either it will go under the cable roll or comes outside from side which stuck during roll.
2,Too light and comes apart easily.
2,Someone or something needs to hold it down while pulling the extension cord out. Otherwise it will be moving allmover the place or falling on its side. Winding the cord back up is a nightmare.  There is a 1:1 handle turn to spool ratio. If you have 150 ft of thin wire on it or so your arm will be dead from winding bybthe time it is all back on the spool. Would NOT buy again.
4,My only complaint is the handle for turning the rack is much too small and flimsy. I replaced it with a handle I had in my scrap box and now it works great. I have 50’ of 12 gauge on it with room to spare.
4,Easy to put together.  Light weight.  Smaller than I thought.  In order for this to work better it was necessary to mount unit to a 1/2 inch piece of plywood about 16" X 16".  This gives a place to put your foot to hold it in place while reeling in cable and prevents it from falling over
5,VERY HANDY.  EASY TO ROLL UP WIRE
5,As a woman in my seventies I didn't find the assembly to be too difficult.
4,Feels solid.  A little small for use with # 14 cord
4,Based on the pictures I guess I expected this to be big but it is only 13inches tall from base to the top of the handle. I was able to fit a 150 foot 16/3 cord with no problem. The reel is very sturdy and the build quality is good. Installation is pretty simple. You just snap the two reel pieces together and you are good to go. The reel turns smooth so reeling and unreeling is not a problem.The only cons I have with this reel is that I wish it was just a little bit taller and the handle to turn the reel is too small feels like a toy.For yard work or DIY work around the house this works fine. However it may not be the best option for someone who works in heavy industrial/construction work environment.
3,No es fácil de usar porque se cae con facilidad el material plástico no es bueno se rompió solo de usarlo poco
4,It is small light and mostly plastic. But I think it was worth every penny. Easy to use and I think it will hold up to homeowner use (I wouldn't trust it in a work truck).
2,I buy a lot of things here and don't really have time to write reviews. But this purchase has motivated me to take the time to comment. I'll not go back and read the reviews I read before making this purchase but I'm pretty sure someone said they managed to put 100' of 12G cord on this reel. Mine arrived yesterday in a WalMart box (yuck!) and I'm not sure I would put 50' of 16G cord on this reel. The reel itself is plastic with a little (~2") plastic reel knob that feels so flimsy I'm not sure it wouldn't break off the first time you try to reel in 100' of cord...unless you make it a practice to hand-feed cord to the reel. The little brochure that came with this Woods Model 22849 Cord Reel with Metal Stand says that it "holds 100 ft. of 14 gauge cord." Maybe it does but have fun reeling in that 100' by hand-spinning the reel. You would think that any credible manufacturer wouldn't talk about the capacity of the reel without also engineering durability to handle the advertised capacity. I'll put my 100'10A (16G) cord on this reel and hope it holds up for a season. I have serious doubts about durability of this reel with a 14G cord. As for pushing past the manufacturer's stated capacity and thinking that you'll get away with putting 100' of 12G cord on this? Forget about it.
2,It’s side are plastic which make it very cheap (you get what you pay for). If you have a 12/3 then this won’t work well. It takes much strength to roll up and the knob used to reel it in is way too small and flimsy. It would be good for a 16 gauge cord but nothing larger. If you’ve got a 12/3 keep looking.
5,I have 100' of 12/3 extension cord wrapped up on this works great.  It's a flexible / cold weather cord for a snowblower.  It takes the whole 100' no problem without even being careful on how I wrap it.  Yes contrary to what other reviews say it's definitely 12/3 and definitely 100 feet.You have to hold it down as you roll it up and it might not unroll the last few feet of cable without being held down either.  It's just physics there is no design flaw here.  The winding nub works fine you don't need a big handle.  I used it in 20 degree weather a couple of times now.Ignore the negative reviews these people don't have any commen sense.
4,Decent product. Bought 3 for my 100’ cords. Works well
5,I was looking for a durable light weight inexpensive simple designed Extension Cord Reel. The Woods extension Cord Reel fit the bill with a slight modification. As you can see I had to use a hole saw to make a round hole in the outer disk (disk away from handle) in order to put the Male Plug through and zip tie it in place. The idea is when ever I need an extension cord all I have to do is sit the Extension Cord Reel near the outlet pull out the length of cord I need (female end) then plug the attached Male End into the outlet. Once I was done all I had to do was unplug both ends and reel the cord in for easy cleanup. Works like a champ!
2,I have used it 2 times and each time the nut comes of and it falls apart.  Refund process ridiculous
2,I'm sure this was just an oversight but I didn't get all the pieces.  I ordered 3.  I got 2 1/2.  The 3rd items didn't have the extra black saucer shaped piece that was supposed to snap into place to create the "cord capture" so it is useless now.  Ron
3,Once we placed the extension cords on this product they came apart - Really disappointed in the quality of the product -
3,I bought one and liked it enough to buy a second one. However the second one came broken. One of the clips that hold the wheel together was broken off and sitting in the bottom of the box. The box was in perfect shape so I'm not sure how it happened.  I decided to keep it and just repair it somehow maybe a bolt or glue.
3,Convenient to keep the cord rolled up but difficult to roll it up.  I think a reel for air lines would be much better.
5,Easy to use and it does great work. just as intended
5,Works great light weight serves my purposes well.
5,This is a average reel. I took the advice of others and secured the nut so that it will not come off in the future. I drilled a hole through the nut and threaded channel and ran wire through it and twisted tight. The handle is metal everything else is plastic.
4,Works fine... a little too light when reeling in..
3,The plastic wheel is flimsy and bends when rolling up cords. Otherwise it's acceptable.
5,Do yourself a favor before assembling this. There is a large nylon nut on one half of the reel. Remove this nut and apply a small amount of super glue to the thread and then reinstall the nut and lightly hand tighten. This will prevent the nut from falling off during reeling. I lost the nut in the grass the first time I used the reel. It’s harder to remove  and reinstall the nut after assembly.
4,This is a preliminary review.  I just loaded 100' of 12/3 extension cord on the reel.  It seems sturdy but time will tell.  I do not like the fact that the "handle" for the reel is just a little 1" long knob instead of an actual handle you could grip with your hand.  It's a little more difficult to wind up a heavy cord with just two fingers.  Check out https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2B8OUWIMS9I50 her pics for a better image of the that puny little knob.
5,Loved this it’s so much easier then them being in a mess. Keeps them rolled up. Love it to.
2,For storage of 100 ft 14 wag wire.
5,Bought two of these because of the review and pictures by Mistress of Dragons. I cut holes and wrapped about 5 ft. of male end on the outside edge of the reels as described and shown in the pictures. Worked Great! I was also able to get 100 ft of 12/3 SJ extension (Amazon Basics) on one of the reels and put 50 ft. on the other. I was not very careful about winding level on the 100 ft. reel but it fit anyway. You need to use a lot of pressure to snap the two reel half's together during assembly. There should be no gap.I would highly recommend it. Thank you M of D.
4,Some difficulty putting it together. It is not the easiest wind up the  knob is too small. Other than that its fine.
5,The 100' cord fit easily unrolls smoothly no tangles. The little handle for rewinding didn't work for me because I left a 6' section of cord hanging out due to my garage plugs being up high. Easy enough to use the cut outs as handles to rewind. Very happy with it for storage and use.
3,I have a love/hate relationship with this thing. I'll readily admit that it sure beats just rolling up my 100' cord by hand (ie wrestling with the thing) but what I hate about it is that there's no "weight" to it and that it moves around so easily as I turn it to store away the cord. I have to put my foot down on the bar that touches the ground to prevent it from moving but then that also means that my foot also blocks the "flow" of the cord back into the reel. It does hold my 100' cable quite well (I believe it is a 14 gauge)... just wish it didn't move around so much.If I had the time I would attach a heavier base to it to prevent it from moving... but I shouldn't have to do that.
3,This product was just okay and a little smaller than expected (about 1 foot tall base to top of handle). The metal is the handle and base the reel is made of 2 pieces of plastic that snap together. Not bad unless you are running a lot cord on the reel and the 2 pieces can come apart causing the cord to unspool.For $10 not bad but not much more.
3,The cord capacity is not big enough for 50ft of 12awg. I also had a problem with reel popping off the stand.I ended up getting a garden hose reel for my big lawn maintenance extension cord.
3,Needs to be better built
5,The stand is made of metal but the rolling cord reel is plastic.  Seems sturdy enough and keeps my 100 ft electric cord in order and ready to use without the headache of detangling knots in the cord.
4,power cord
3,I have had this reel for a year and a half now. I have had to modify the 2 plastic pieces that hold the cord. Once I had the 100ft of cord on the reel the plastic clips in the center that hold the 2 pieces failed almost immediately. There are small holes on either side of the clips mostly likely from the molding process. I used small screws to hold the pieces together.
3,nice reel does not have capacity as advertised
4,It's hard to store 100 feet of twisted electrical extension cord consistently without ending up with a mess. I have tried the cheaper hand-held reels with limited success and a great deal of effort. I wanted something better and I found it in the Woods 22849 Cord Reel with Metal Stand. There are some small drawbacks to this item like the inability to keep it steady while reeling that much wire. However it far exceeds the previous mechanisms I've tried by a long-shot.
5,Just received today and set up so my review is based on that for now. It was super easy to set up.I wanted to comment also to say that this does not require modifications as other reviewers stated. Find the middle of the cord hook into the little hooks and then reel in both ends at the same time. No drilling or zip ties needed.
3,The plastic nut that holds the spool on broke after 2 weeks of use
3,Granted....this is a very inexpensive reel.  However even before I got a chance to use it - it broke!  As I was unpacking it one of the plastic tabs that holds the reel together broke off - so the reel itself was not sturdy enough to use.  Didn't matter anyway because it was not strong enough to hold one of those orange heavy duty extension cords....I didn't bother to return it - more of a hassle and waste of my time than the cost of the item.Clearly I can not recommend it - unless you are aware of how fragile the reel is and you don't have a very heavy extension cord to use on it....
3,The knob that gets held to wind the cord in is too small in diameter.  It's about 1/2" across and should be about twice that size.  It works but it's not quite prime time.There is no place for cord locking once the cord is wound up.It actually does hold 150 feet of cord albeit with no spare room at all.  You must wind carefully using one hand to crank and the other to apply drag to the cord and direct how it is wound.It's light especially for having a frame for the spool.  The only things lighter seem to be the plastic kind that have no frame.I'd likely use this product again but I would see if a better alternative exists in the future even though this was the best I could find at the time of this purcahse and rating.
1,Stand is metal reel is flimsy plastic. Also parts were missing.  Very disappointed.
5,all my devices for landscaping have cable so this is perfect in order not to damage the cable when you pick it up with this does not twisting itself get damage and cause sparks
2,I do not recommend this item for heavier cords there’s definitely not enough room. It is also too lightweight to hold it mine also came with a missing piece.
5,WILL NOT hold 100' of 12/3 wire!  Whoever said it did obviously does not really have 12/3 wire.  That is what I bought it for and understood it would be close but this reel might hold 50 feet of 12/3 at best.It does seem to be a good quality reel at a good price for 16/3 or even up to 100' of 14/3 (and that is heavy and hard to roll up towards the end) and I will keep it for that but it is smaller and lighter than I expected and I will have to get another reel for my 100' of 12/3 wire.
5,I bought this to roll up about 100 feet of extension cord.  I can get it all on the unit but because it is 2 - 50 ft cords connected I have to play with it a little to get it all on.  It makes it easier to keep it untangled and out of the way.
3,I ordered this after reading reviews on almost all available. Comments indicated my cord would fit. I did not want to spend a lot because the cord will only be used a few times a year. I tried to roll my cord up but it was very difficult with tangling and falling off the reel. As a female my cord itself is difficult to maneuver so that may play a part but my cord barely fit. I was not able to get it "perfectly" coiled. I will keep for storage since it is not in daily use. If you have a smaller cord this product would be 4 stars. If you have a 12/3 and will be using often I would look for something else.
5,This reel was easy to put together and seems to be very sturdy.  I put 100 feet of cord on it with no problem.
4,Inexpensive reel for wire organization not much bells and whistles
5,Much better than the standard "orange wheel" I bought previously whose knob would always fall off no matter how much I tightened it.This is just an all around a better product. Because of the metal frame with a stand and handle atop I can just set it on the ground grip the handle with one hand and reel in the cable using the knob attached to the wheel.I tire of crap products that fall apart and am really happy with this one. It's a metal frame the black wheel is plastic but it doesn't really need to be anything more.
4,Well made and works well. The plastic is a bit flexible which seems to be a good idea so it doesn't crack. I would buy again. I have bought two now. The second one was very difficult to put the pieces together until I had the bright idea to heat up some water in a bowl and soak the reel in it for a few seconds to make the plastic a bit more flexible...and then - pop - they connected perfectly. It is holding 100 feet of  gage 14 cord with room to spare.
3,Yeah I cheated and already owned one of these handy reels and bought a second one for another drop cord.  So why only a three rating?  Because it's plastic. It's really very handy to store an extension cord for trimmers and other yard use and easy to transport from place to place.  But it's plastic. It's light and the handle is comfortable.  The truth is I initially bought two of these one for each of my two drop cords.  While using the first one I placed the reel on top of a cabinet nearby.  Somehow the reel was knocked from the cabinet and landed on the cement shop floor....and broke....because it's plastic. I'm now more careful where I put the reel and haven't had any trouble since...so don't toss it around and you'll likely be satisfied too.
5,This reel is very lightweight but certainly did the trick for what I needed. I rolled up 100 feet of 14/2 cord with no problem. It has a convenient handle to transport it to wherever it is needed. I recommend this item.
5,Keeps cords organized....great space saver
5,good product thanks
3,It is to small for a man to handle it.Also its wheel handle come off pretty soon.
5,works very well with my extension cord. What I did not know is the way this reel works best is to hook the center of the cord around the little hook on the reel and the wind up both ends at the same time. Once I figure that out its really good.
2,If your on a budget it’s work well for that but it’s weak my came broken sucked but rather get a metal one rather than plastic.
5,I had piles of tangled extension cords everywhere..... not anymore they are all wound around these.  I mean what else do you need to know?  They are fine.
5,good quality cord reel
4,Does its job with no frills
4,Not what I would expect. Cheaply made
1,Missing part to lock the roll to the metal housing.
3,It’s cheap and to use your cord you have un ravel the entire cord even if you just need to use a little bit
4,i slipped about 2ft of my 100 ft extension cord  [Coleman Cable 02569 12/3-Gauge High Visibility and Low Temperature Outdoor]  from the inside of the reel to the outside and helded it in that round notch the 2ft of cord was wrapped around the outside reel and held there with long bread ties [this end had the male plug] then i just rolled the rest of the extension cord into the reel the reel could probably hold about 5 more ft just bought/started using it ... so far happy with it
5,This will be my second purchase. I followed the reviews about drilling a hole and zip tie one end of the cord to the reel. Worked fantastic. Highly recommend.
5,Using this for a 100ft airline. I fitted this to a 30" length of 1 x 6  so it would not tip over and use it as a portable air hose extension. My pvc hose was impossible to keep neat before I bought this so now I am really happy.
5,Helped roll a large extension cord that I've hand rolled for years. This makes it so easy and fast to store the extension cord in my shed.
5,I wrap up a 50' cord in this no problem. I was on the fence and decided to get it. It's sturdy and I use it a few times a week. I'm happy with this purchase.
2,Difficult to wind the cord onto.You'd have to mount it to a wall.
4,No complaints so far purchased 1 and after reacieing it I got another. Best Cord Holder I have ever invested in and Priced right.............No Complaints and the Seller Shipped fast............
5,Lightweight yet strudy!
2,Bought this as an upgrade to my cheap orange plastic cord reel and couldn't be more disappointed.  The unit appears heavy duty but it is configured in a way that does not allow the cord end at the center of the roll to hang out during rolling for partial unroll use.  If you leave a length out of the spool it smacks you in the arms and chest while rolling up which is very painful and the frame structure does not allow it to go out of the other side.  Also the nut comes loose and the whole thing falls apart.  I consider this a total waste of money.
4,took my wife 3 seconds to put it together. Very useful
5,Excellent..Very nice..I was very surprised at the quality..
5,It fits 100' 16-gauge extension cord.  Only two things I would like to see improved.  First a longer handle for the reel.  Second a little more weight overall.  I was impressed by the size of the carrying handle and the cord capacity of course.
5,Simple and usable. I am not sure why I had to assemble it but it's not a big deal. I use it with 50' Flexeel air compressor hose and it works great.
4,Bought this because I was tired of wrapping extension cords with my arm. This is a good quality cord reel. Easiest way to use is to fold your extension cord in half. Take the closed end and zip tie it to the center of the wheel. Reel both ends in together. When you need to use it place the reel half way to the socket and where you intend to use it. Pull both ends out at the same time for desired distance.
3,Work good for the price but it’s hard to roll the cable.
5,The product is great just what I needed. The issue is where my package was left. It was 8 to 10 feet from the road and 30 ft from my garage. They left it sitting next to a wall going up my driveway .
4,I would give it 5 stars if it had a better hand crank. I had to modify the one that comes on it so it's easier to hold.
4,Thought it was all metal but it's not as they didnt state this. The handle is Metal but the reel is plastic. This is supposed to be metal if not I would have just bought an all plastic one.
3,You want something for $10...this item is worth what you pay.  Does the job ...mostly... but overall pretty poor quality.
2,The spool on mine fell apart multiple times when winding the cord. It barely fits a 100 foot cord but that will vary by wire gauge and brand.This would be fine for a small gauge extension cord... which should never be this long but not great or even very good for a larger diameter cord. 14 gauge is a bit thick for it.
3,I've purchased 2 of these.  The first one im still using everyday.  The 2nd one broke first time using it.  Will be sending it back
5,Ordered to use with my 12/3 cord 100 ft and it just fit. No extra room in reel. Feel is nice and light weight.
3,It’s a good reel. But handle to roll up might be bigger and once you roll up some weight on it. It starts to get hard and start feeling like it’s not going to last. But we see.
5,If one wants to have a better option to coil 100’ of extension wire around ones arm and avoid tangles get this.
3,Only the handle is metal.
5,Nice metal framing with a plastic spool but seems to work perfect wrap it up and forget about it
4,works pretty well although I wish the frame itself to be heavier since the reel is so large and the cabling can be really heavy to where you have to put your foot on the legs to keep it from moving while you wind it back up..
3,It is not good enough to recommendation.But it's not bad.
5,Had to make a minor adjustment to allow me to role it up while still plugged in.
5,It took me a minute to get it together and loaded.  Works fine.
5,This works very well for my 100 foot 13 amp cord.  I fold the cord in the middle & roll from the middle so both ends end up at the outside of the reel.  I need the entire 100 feet for my electric mower so I have to unroll completely every time anyway.  The reel is lightweight & reels the cord quite easily.  You just need to step on the front of the base to steady the reel.  The handle makes it very easy to carry the reel around.  My cord stays nice & tidy with no damage.
3,These are really cheap. It's hard to wind a cord on them and it's not that user friendly. I bought two. I put them on the front yard for free already.
5,The item is great for the price having 2 - 100 " electrical cords it made it easy to store and out of the way with the cords good buy.
5,Keeps cord neatly and easy to use
3,It's only part metal.The spool part is plastic.It works.
4,I live in a condo and this is used with a 100ft & 25ft cable so I can connect a orbiter and vacuum to the clean and wax my car.Will do its job of holding up to 125 ft of cordI wish there was something to hold the ends of the cable build into the wheel.
1,This is not for "heavy duty" use. It broke apart several times and I gave up. There are plastic materials that can be used for this application and it appears they went the low-cost route. I threw it in the trash.Given the good reviews I suspect they changed the materials recently to a lower grade. Most unfortunate.Highly not recommended.
3,It is flimsy. Better used with light-weight - 16 gauge- extension cord.
3,Sturdy built and light weight but it lacks on the of the basic need where it should allow the cord end to be placed in such a way that you don't have to unwind to put in plug.
4,sturdy and held 100 ft 12 gauge drop cord.  Folded like Tommy Silva's advice its perfect.  It is not ALL metal.  the discs are poly something but feel strong.
5,My husband is very pleased with this rugged reel. 100 ft. of 12/3 heavy duty extension cord fits with room to spare.  He cut a hole in the center spool to allow about two feet to pass through and velcroed it down on the outer face of the reel (see attached photo).  Works great with the snowblower purchased at the same time.  This handy reel gets him back inside faster and keeps the cord neat & contained.
4,The cable reel has a smooth rolling mechanism with metal construction using it for a 100ft cable much better than rolling it up by hand I would make the base a little wider so it has a little more stability when rolling and unrolling the cable.  Overall good cable reel
5,We have a inflatable business this made wrapping up our cords so much easier.
3,The spool is not large enough to hold the cord it claims to hold. It might hold a roll of dental floss but not a decent extension cord.The ad said that it is metal the frame is metal the spool is plastic.The price is low the size is small.
5,Use this every week and it really solved the problem of constantly knotted cord
5,Fast shipping easy to assemble and a snap toUse.
5,Use this for my pressure washer hose and it does very well. Its around 50-60 feet and still has more room for extra just not too much more.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This can also hold 50 feet of hose for use with an air compressor.
5,Love the size and weight makes it easy to carry and use.Once rolled it holds the cord securely.Kind of awkward to roll up but not so much that it is really hard. It just takes practice to learn how to do it quickly.
1,I bought this for a 100ft extension cord every time i reel the cord in the middle ring that hold the wheel together unscrews causing the wheel to fall apart.
1,Assembly requires you to snap both sides of the wheel together. Each wheel has 3 prongs. On prong snapped one bent halfway off and a third showed signs of snapping as well before it finally went together. The first time I used this to wind up my cord the entire wheel snapped free of the base with no way to reattach. Already requested a return. Do not buy this item.
1,How anyone gives this peice of garbage a good review is beyond me. This thing is just a waste of plastic. I grow tired of the Chinese garbage sold on Amazon and given high reviews buy obviously fake accounts. Save your money.
4,I'm giving it 4 stars because it's much better than nothing. I have 2  50 foot cords on it one 14 ga and one 12 ga and it's a little small for them but  I can cram them on if I'm careful.  The sides could be higher but for the $ it's worthwhile to have one of these.
5,After spending a lot of time shopping for a heavy duty cord reel this one appeared.  I think it is much better than the all plastic ones for only a couple more dollars.  I have two 50-foot lengths of 14 AWG speaker cable wound on mine and to use it we just unroll it like fishing line.  It turns easily with the crank handle when winding up.  Win win win!
2,The construction of the item is reasonably good but I have not had it long enough to determine how well it holds up over time. There are two issues with it however. First Amazon advertises the reel as holding 150 feet of 16 guage cord but the item 22849 is described on the attached pamphlet as holding 100 feet of 14 gauge cord. The manufacture's description is more accurate than Amazon's; I could not get 150 feet of 16 gauge cord on the stand. Second the design is not great. There is no easy way that I can find to reel and unreel a cord such that the male end stays ready to plug into a socket after unreeling a length of cord. But if your plan is to entirely unreal the entire length of cord for each use then this is not an issue.
1,I just returned my second hose reel. They both arrived damage. The only assembly required is to snap the two half’s of the reel together. The hubs of the each reel half has three slots and three tabs that snap together. One tab was broken off of each of the reels I received. Curiously I noticed both reels were manufactured in 2017. I learned that from this Amazon purchased with two strikes you are out. I did not have an option available to return for replacement the second damaged reel. My only option was to return for a refund. Debating whether to reorder a third one but probably won’t.
5,Sturdy and simple to use thanks to the metal frame. Similar priced competitors are all plastic and very flimsy. It fit 100 foot long 13 gauge extension cord quite nicely
5,I have ordered another Woods reel with extra power outlets besides this one. That feels flimsy and this one is sturdy and heavy. Pretty happy with this reel.
5,Small size. I have 3 reels. One used to reel 50 foot of water hose which works great for storing and using with my 5th wheel RV trailer. One for storing about 100 foot of Christmas out door lights and one for reeling up my 75 foot of 14/3 cord. Made more for home use than commercial.
5,Used it on 100' 12 gauge snow blower cord (blue).  Fits just right.  Have little rm left but I wouldn't load any more or use on higher gauge with 100'.Solid and easy to use.
3,I found this disappointing.The wheel is sturdy and holds the size/length of cord I was expecting. But I was really hoping it would have a way to keep the cord on the reel plugged in and extend and wind up while still plugged in. It can't. To use it I've had to basically in wind the whole thing and plug it in and then wind the whole thing back up again. What a pain.At least it stores the cord neatly.
5,I was looking for something to wrap my small expandable water hose and this actually worked great!
5,Got this for a different type of use... my elderly Mother lives with me and is on home oxygen. I use long connected O2 tubing so she can get out to the pool for water therapy. This reel is perfect to wrap up the tubing when pool fun is done. Works great.
2,The web description states " Woods metal cord reel with stand works with most single outlet extension cords and can hold up to 150 of 12 14 and 16/3 Gauge cords".  The reel is not metal it is plastic.  These break easily in cold weather.  I bought this because I thought it was a metal reel.  Additionally my 100 foot cord (I think it's 12 gauge grounded) would only fit about 80 feet on the reel.  It's very small for a long power cord.  I think it would work great with 50 or even 75' heavy duty power cords but it is badly misrepresented.
4,Very good cord reel. Mine sufficiently held a 50 foot heavy duty 12-2 with ground cord with no room to spare. Very happy with my purchase.
3,I'm referring to this cord reel it's barely able to keep 100 feet of 16awg cord.Metal construction is only for the frame/handle. The spool is made of plastic.The cord keeper tab on the spool is also made of plastic.The trick with cord reel is to fold the cord into two and tie the end to the reel - half the effort to coil/uncoil.For safety reason you'll want the extension cord to be uncoiled all the way - coiled cord & high usage = fire hazard
2,This thing barely hold a 75 feet Husky 14/3 extension cord. 3 days old and already falling apart also very awkward to wound up. Since 14/3 cords tends to be heavy - not suitable in my opinion.
5,This works great!  So happy with the product.  Keeps my cords neat and ready.
5,I bought this for my 100 ft electric snowblower extension cord. It fit with no problem.My specific cord: Smart Electrician 100' General-Purpose Extension Cord 12/3 (from Menards)For the price this reel is a great deal. I don't think it would hold up to daily use but it is great for my needs.
4,Works good
5,buen producto
4,Does the job
5,Easy to put together keeps cord out of the way good purchase
1,It came apart after one week. A cheap plastic nut holds the hose reel on. I tried putting it back on but the threads are stripped and won't hold it together.
5,It handled 100 foot cord no problem.
2,Metal stand with plastic wheel light weight tend to fall over. I will buy a full metal stand next time even it's heavy.
1,I took alot of time rolling up my 100ft extension cord with another 10 footer. Then it snows a bit one day and my snowblower battery runs out. Perfect I get to see how this stand holds up. I plug it in pull out some get about 10 ft and I can't really move i tug on the cord a little the entire stand falls over and the handle breaks. OK no a big thing I move it out and against the threshold of the door now I should be able to move. NOPE! same thing happens i get a little farther I get stopped give it a little tug and the whole thing falls over again breaks the middle pieces and now i can't even put the two pieces back together and now I once again have a ball of 100ft of extension cord. Seriously look for something else.
5,Gets the job done and is really durable.
3,Used this for my hose.  Had to hold product with my foot to roll and unroll hose.
5,Very functional reef that significantly reduced my dispensing and recovery of my extension cord.
4,These cord reels work perfect for my application. Winding 100ft power cords and some long antenna cables. These are very light weight plastic so I don't think I would take them on a job site and expect them to last. Work well in my garage and yard.
5,Use lots of gaffers tape.
1,The screw that holds the real onto the stand was constantly falling off. It has now vanished and I have no idea where it ended up in my yard. However it's not a big deal because the thing is so awkward to use that I'd rather throw it away than replace the missing part. In order to use it you have 3 choices:1. Take the whole cable off the real every time.2. Connect an extension cord to your extension cord. <insert Xzibit meme here>3. Leave a few feet of cord sticking out the end which makes winding up the rest of the cord more frustrating than just dealing with a tangled cord would be. The loose cord just keeps wrapping around your wrist and twisting itself in knots anyway so what's the point?
5,Easy to use
3,Does it work? Yes but It is a little flimsy and difficult to snap the wheel together. Also the handle for spinning is garbage it does hold a 100’ 12g cord
3,Holds the cheaper cords best. I tried to use it for a more better cord and it falls apart
2,Smaller than expected.  While it seems sturdy the claim of handling 100 feet of extension cord is false.  I wanted to use it for two 50 ft cords but after placing the first one on it clearly didn't have room for the second.
5,I haven't tried one of these before. So I cant compare it to other products or doing something different with my cords. But I can say that I like it so much I'm gonna buy another one.
3,This item is much smaller that what you may think. I've bought two of them and I am a bit confused and disappointed.Amazon offered 20% off but honestly the price is not the problem.If you are able to fit 150' of 16 gauge cable on this reel you are a blo.. genius.The reel itself is made of plastic. The axles is really wobly. The only part that looks sturdy is the handle.
4,Nice reel. The winding handle is a little light duty but overall a nice reel.
1,The spool is held onto the axle with a plastic nut.  As you're winding up the cord the nut backs out and the spool falls off.  I'm going to try and epoxy the nut in place.  I wasn't expecting much for the money and thats what I got not much.  The stand is metal but most of the remainder is plastic.  Flimsy and awkward to use.
5,Very good product for a very good price . It usually take me 5-7 minutes to fight the wires after use  but now  I just roll them up  no more unwanted knots when I want to use the wires .
3,This works as advertised. I'm using it with a long cord--the longest length suggested by the stand. The stand itself is fairly light so it tips over easily. It also becomes difficult to wind up as it gets full. I would recommend this one for a shorter hose like 25 or 50 feet. I'm going to seek a heavier-duty one for my longer cord and use this one for my short one.
2,Yikes this thing is cheap and not worth a dime. It keeps falling apart basically crumbling whenever I pick it up. Do not buy.
5,I got tired of untangling my 100 ft electric cord. This product worked perfectly. Wound up the cord quickly and with no tangles.
4,This reel is larger than I expected making it more cumbersome to store. However it does it's job well.  We use it now with a pretty heavy cord (seems like commercial quality).  I'd recommend a lighter weight cord for easier reeling
4,Good price.  These are very handy!
5,Simple and metal... not plastic.
5,Works Great.
3,cheap good to use
2,Cheap made
2,I purchased a orange plastic version of this last year. I needed a 2nd. I saw the "metal stand" and thought it would be a perfect bonus. The problem is the metal stand is useless when the rest of it is flimsy rubber-like plastic. I have used this 3 times and now the handle is broken and the nut holding the wheel spins off while winding the cord.The orange plastic version is still holding up strong.
3,Came with patchy paint and rust already in place. Pretty poor workmanship.
3,I bought this cord reel to hold a 50 ft 12x3 extension cord.  It arrived assembled.  It does the job but is awkward to operate.  The center of the reel is not uniform diameter - it's bigger at the outside than in the center.  Winding up the cord requires careful manipulation with both hands to get the whole length onto the reel.
5,Muy útilLo recomiendo
2,3 tabs used to lock the two halves together 2 on one side one on the other broke off. Although it went together it's just a matter of time before it becomes useless.
1,Metal stand is ok the rest is flimsy and very frustrating to use: cord do not snap in easily in the locking holes but incredibly fall out without any issue; if you start to reel do not stop! or it is going to spin back unrolling the cable you already rolled up! as annoying as bird nest on a fishing rod reel
4,I got this to roll up electric fence wire on my farm.  The two halves of the reel seperated from each other after a little use.  I bolted them together and haven't had a problem since.
2,I am pleased with the quality and construction of this product; however the PRODUCT DESCRIPTION on the website is INCORRECT. The description stated that the reel holds up to 150 feet of cord while the label on the product tag states that the reel holds up to 100 feet.  Since my cords are 100 feet the discrepancy does not really affect me but I would have been VERY disappointed if my cords had been 150 feet because I would not have been able to use the reels.
3,A nice reel.  I have a 100 ft large diameter cord that I was "just" able to spool on this.  Some instructions on how to properly attach the cord to the reel would have been nice.
5,works good to roll up and store cord
5,Holds 100' of cord with spare room for more easy to put away now after use. I never remove the whole cord so I have a shorter cord I run from the  wall plug to the plug on the reel works for me!
2,Other than the fact the screw that holds the wheel onto the main base keeps coming off making it basically fall apart it’s perfect.
2,I returned this item.  I could not put it together.  Wish they sent it already put together.
3,Item is supposed to hold 150 feet however my 100 foot cord barely fits.  Plus as you wind up the cord often is "slips" off the reel and causes a bit of a tangled mess that is more difficult than you think to solve!
4,Seems fine.  I put 100' on it and it seemed rather full.  I'd probably buy it again.
5,I use this for winding portable polywire electric fencing. The reels designed for this purpose are grossly overpriced and the orange plastic cord winders are frustrating (if the wire slips off it creates a huge tangle). The open ended design is perfect of I mis-wind and the metal base rests perfectly and comfortably against my chest while reeling.
5,Worked great!
2,I got this for my mother-in-law for Christmas. It was nicely wrapped so I was stupid and didn't unwrap all the bubble wrap to double check it. Never thought I should have to check for rust on a new product. She didn't want the hassle of returning it and I am sure it'll do the job but still very disappointing.
4,great price very easy to put together used once and did not have too big of a problem rolling up 100 ft of cord.  Would recommend to buy
5,Love it.  Easy to to put away.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Center has nut that spins off lost it in the snow. Not usable. Throwing it away. Won’t buy replacement. I’ll just wrap up my 100 ft extension cord around my arm. Much quicker and easier to use.
5,It fit 100’ of 12/3 just fine.
5,If you find yourself spending time with a rats nest of extension cords this product is for you. I have a 100 ft extension cord and it fits on the spool.  No more untying extension cords.
5,Smaller than I thought when I purchased it but it is still a good value for the money.  Well made great for shorter cords.
5,I bought a 100-ft outdoor electrical extension cord and then realized just how unwieldy it can be.  This reel stand is very convenient and makes the long extension cord manageable.  It is an impressive value.
3,This is a very study product but the description states (twice) that it will accommodate150' of 12/3 gauge cords. This reel barely holds 100' of 12/3 gauge cords.
1,The product looks like it will hold the extension cord when rolled up if all the pieces ship. Make sure all the pieces are in the box. The return process is weird for this item. It’s easier to just bite the bullet and order another one and hope for better results.
2,Okay. Misleading materials section. This reel is NOT pure metal. Only the stand is metal while the rest is plastic.
3,Durable and looks nice but no hole in the middle to put the cord through do you dan plug it in while on spool.
5,A+
1,It came missing a part an dammaged.
5,Worked very well with my 100' outdoor extension cord.
4,It works. Is pretty handy. Have to unroll most of the cord each time but it sure beats trying to wind it around my hand and forearm and then keep it from tangling.
3,This will hold 100 ft of 14 gage. Plastic reel. But unless you are willing to pay $150 for one you would love this is it.
4,I bouight this becasue i got sick of wrapping my 100ft cord around my arm only to get it tangled every time I used it. This worked to keep it organized.
4,fits the cord okay.
5,easy to assemble. easy to wrap cord and very sturdy.
5,I bought this to wrap my miniature Christmas lights around and it is perfect.  Each strand is 150 lights this reel held about 5 strands or so.  Best investment I have made!
5,Sturdy metal bar. Strong plastic. Definitely stiffer plastic than my orange all plastic wheel reel. I modified mine to feed the male plug thru a hole I drilled in the plastic. Definitely recommend this reel.
3,Worked well for a year then reel-up handle (plastic) broke off. Second year unit fell apart in my van.
2,Very small be aware that size does matter
4,Product as advertised good price quick delivery
1,I got this to help deal with all the loose cords I have for outdoor use. This reel is cumbersome to operate and is not practical. It is a waste of money for every day use for anything heavier than rope. Going to ghostwrited back to rolling up by hand until something better comes up.
5,Much better than the ones you see at Home Depot Lowes ...
1,I bought it about a month ago and reel up my brand new extension cord too. put it in a space next to my pressure washer set it up there and not use it until now. pulled it ok. fell to the floor and that's it as shown in picture could not use it no more is mere plastic. it look nice tho ha that's it.I am going to try another brand. I chose another one but read METAL on this one so delete the other one from my shopping cart and added this one. my mistake.
5,perfect solution
5,I use this with my Toro leaf blower and vac.  I have a 100 foot cord then a 50 foot cord at the end.  Use the shorter cord to attach to the electrical source and the inner cord.  Works good.
3,None
3,The handle to turn to wind is short especially if you are wearing gloves.  There is not hole in the center to put a tie rap through like other cord reels so you can half the cord and wind up both sides at once.
5,I use this to wind up my oxygen tubing at night. It’s very lightweight but it suits my needs perfectly.
1,Product worked well until it didn't. Whoever engineered this decided to to make the "plastic" nut that holds the thing together more than a 1" which doesn't come in any mechanic set under $400.
1,THis is a piece of junk.  Doesn’t work good AT ALL!!!  When you try to unroll it you better hang on tight cuz it wobbles all over the place.  You need THREE HANDS to use this and even then it’s very cumbersome.Waste of money.
4,Not the sturdiest but for price it's a pretty good product. It does the job ans so far is holding up well.
1,A real pain to join the two halves.  Finally got them together by using a screwdriver to open the tabs a bit.  Don't understand why not just screw together.  Not what I would say was heavy duty but light duty based on the flimsy plastics.  Would not buy again.
4,Good quality.  Metal frame and thick plastic reel.  Helps to place a foot on the frame to stop it from moving while spinning.
5,Easy to place together. Appears to be durable. Wrapped 50’ extension cord with this. Will update if there are any issues after several uses.
4,very sturdy
5,Light and. Well. Designed
4,I got 100' cord and needed an easy way to keep it manageable.  This does the trick.  Winds it up quickly for storage.
1,Product is now $10 less than when I purchased it a month ago. No surprise. Isn't worth the current price and definately not what I paid for.  The base is metal but the wheel is plastic.  Does not hold my 100ft cord solidly at all.  I had high hope it would be an easy way to use and store my extension cord easily.  Epic fail on both!  Don't waste your money on this product.
5,used for my 100 ft outdoor power cord and it really works.  It's light (good for moving it around) so make sure to step on it or weight it down with something when you pull out the cable otherwise you might drag it along.
2,I thought this guy looked a little sturdier than some of the others you see on Amazon. While the frame is metal the design really sucks. You have to hold the frame down with your foot .. while winding with one hand and guiding the cord with the other. You basically have to pull all the cord out when you want to use it. This thing will hold your extension cord in a somewhat orderly manner but don't expect it to make your life much easier.
4,Nice reel. A little smaller than what I need
3,Much smaller than expected.  Good for smaller gauge cords but not for heavier gauges due to small inner diameter roll and overall size.
3,Its difficult to turn the wheel
2,Ordered the 150 ft long reel and recd the 100 ft one.-UPDATE-Even through the wrong item came our cord does fit and so far so good so maybe it was just mislabeled?  Didn't pay much so not expecting the best of quality when it's in use but we'll see as spring comes and I test it with the blower/vac.
4,It's smaller then I would like it but it will work great for taking to work. I have 2 now. Good deal
5,My reel came already assembled even though it also came with assembly instructions...  The reel was able to hold a 100' 12 gauge extension cord which many of the other reels available will not.  The metal frame seems pretty sturdy and the reel spins easily to load or unload the cord.
4,work good for air hoses
5,Ordered 2 of these for my 100 foot outdoor extension cords.  They work great and are easy to use.  Seem well made and look good.  Very happy with my purchase!
2,Eh it does the job but If you aren't careful you will whack your knuckles on the plug as it winds around the spool.Edit: knob broke off after three years of light use. Sad thing is it broke off when it fell in the grass. How can anything break when it falls in GRASS????
4,Perfect for my use around the garden. Much better than dealing with tangled cords. I ended up getting three of them. Fast shipping too.
1,What is the secret to putting the 2 pieces together??? Only 2 pieces -- should be simple right? Directions say "3. Press firmly around inside edge until all tabs have locked into  place." I have pressed as firmly as I am able to press without a hammer and reel refuses to go together. HELP! Should I use that hammer?SignedOne Unhappy Customer right now
1,I bought this a year ago and the handle broke off. Not durably built. Frustrating.The hole for the handle sits near the rim of the reel and it cracked. The plastic is too thin for the stress. This makes rigging a repair more complicated.I had a different brand for years with no problems until a full reel fell off of a table and broke - my fault not the reels.
3,It's ok.  It is a bit cumbersome to roll the wire on but it is much nicer than having a messy pile of wire.  I'll probably try something else next time but it'll do for now.  At least it was cheap!
3,You get what you pay for with this item. It's better for carrying the cord than for being really easy to use. Overall I'm pleased with it but I would probably get something else if I needed to get another cord reel.
3,Soso
5,Nothing
4,I bought this item for my wife and she is happy with it. Putting together was a snap. Pardon the pun.
3,It's OK for a basic cord reel and I would recommend it for a simple generic product.  However we purchased two other same size reels that were wired with 4 self-contained outlets and other features from another retailer for less money.
4,It's not super sturdy but not cheap. Great for the price. Exactly what I wanted and loved the price.
1,It is hard to write anything positive about this. It dod arrive on time is about the only good thing that I can say. First only half of the item showed up. The half that arrived was damaged. What I did receive was a partial spool that was scratched and cracked. This item is completely useless and a complete waste of my time. I really did have high hopes for this.
4,its ok but small will only use it in the wintersill for the price i like it.easy to store
1,Worthless. Reel is made of plastic. Does even stay on frame. The spindle is threaded but there's no cap to keep the reel in place. Instructions don't mention it either so I don't think it's a situation where I'm missing parts. Reeling in or out will cause the cable wheel to wobble and fall of its frame. DO NOT BUY.
5,👍
3,A bit flimsy but it does the job.
1,will come untightened when trying to spool
1,Not durable and came apart in lees than 2 months time.  Would like to exchange for a new one but cant contact seller.  What a waste of time and money
2,A bit small and feels flimsy. When "rolling" up the cord the reel moves around and falls down quite a lot.  After the initial "rollup" it unwinds a bit on its own. Not the best product but you do get what you pay for.
1,not worth the box it came in.
3,OK... But barely fits 100ft
5,The best reel I could find.  My last one lasted about 10 years of weekly lawn mowing/edging.
2,I had high hopes for this but am disappointed. It is too small and light and that detracts from its usefulness. There is nowhere to put your foot on it to hold it down as you crank and the handle is so close to the reel your knuckles get hit as the wire gets cranked in. It holds two 50 foot extension cords. Next time I think I'd look for something a little larger and sturdier.
3,Not bad for the price.
2,Not worth the $$
5,Does it’s jobI’m a happy customer
1,This Product WILL NOT FIT 100 feet of QUALITY cord. It will barely fit 50.This is a mostly plastic little thing that should just be used indoors for maybe 25 feet.That being said there is nowhere to put the plug end while you wind so it is in the way making this a hug pain to use.
1,Assembly holes does not matches up and the holder was useless without getting assembledReturned immediately as it was waste of time and money
4,Does what it is supposed to do for an extra long extension cord.
5,reasonably well made. been in use for more than a year with a 100 foot extension cord on it. used weekly
5,Woods Cord Reel with Metal Stand is great for coiling and storing an electrical outlet cord.  The large gage cords are heavy and difficult to handle otherwise.
2,Good idea made cheap
3,Easy to carry
3,Spend a little more and get another kind that handles the plug end in a more practical way.
4,Works fine. No issues after a year.
2,Bought these as warehouse deals and they were worth the $15 I paid but worth no where near the retail price.  Tab broke when I tried to secure the cord to the reel handle is too small clumsy to use and in cold weather the cord is almost impossible to keep on the reel
5,Why has it taken me so long to get one of these?  I've wasted so much time and effort over the years...But no more!
5,Great cord reel and works great
3,more plastic than i thought it would be
5,Sturdy
3,Received a used/preassembled reel with two of the six clips broken that hold the two halves together...  Tested reel with 50' of 3/8" PVC Air Hose looks good...
4,Works as promised.  My garage looks more organized already.
5,Best cord reel I ever owned
5,Works very well with the 14/3 100 feet extension cord that I bought it for.
2,Not as well built as I was hoping for
5,This is a must have for a long cord. All my lawn stuff is electric and this is invaluable to have for the 100 ft cord. That is always the most annoying part trying to wrap that up! But now its a cinch!
1,Flimsy trash. Fell apart on first use.  It is absolutely junk. The all plastic model I had worked.  This broke on first use.
3,Not for 12/3 G cord but good quality.
4,Does the job and the price was good.
3,You pretty much have to unreel the entire thing to plug your cord in and use. Not easy to use but stores the cords nicely.
3,Its ok! Slightly flimsy and hard to handle when the cord is wrapped around it. Coiling the cord back on the reel requires a lot of effort.
1,Dislike! Don’t waste a penny here. This thing makes me mad every time I use it. It was suppose to make things easier and less stress and I am extremely disappointed.
4,It doest its purpose. Nothing spectacular.
3,Performance mediocre
4,Very light duty only!!  Full at 100ft.
5,Product used to store extensions cords
5,Good for it's price. Was able to fit a 12/3 100' cord on there.
4,Makes life easier that's for sure.
5,Great - I just ordered another one.  It is amazingly lightweight.  Even if I don't wind the spool carefully the cord is kept much neater than just looped on wall hooks.
1,Fell apart multiple times over the month I've owned it. The cheap plastic part which holds the reel in place kept falling out. Last time it fell out I didn't see where it was and lost it which renders this useless to me.
2,Too small it is not convenient to hold the handle on the top and roll the cable. a 50ft 14 Gage cable hardly fit.
3,Works but not too sturdy and seems kind of cheap to me. At least you can keep your extension neat and off the floor.
5,Wll Done.
5,Solid construction efficient
1,tabs broke when i tried to push the two "easy snap" pieces together. Unsure why this does not come as one piece to begin with. Judging by the size of the wheel i doubt it would have held 100 feet.
1,seems like a good product but had to sent it back because it was loose - and in half in larger box with other item not in its original packaging with half of the reel missing. who packed this?
5,It is very small.. but well constructed and does what I expected it to do. Came assembled. For those who wish to ease their use of a 100 ft cord.. this is an outstanding product.
3,Like the design but does not have a handle to rewind cord when finished. unable to get handle without buying a new reel.
3,Cord gets tangled easily needs cord guide to prevent this!
3,A little lighter weight than expected but does the job well.  Have to anchor it to roll up but handles unrolling on its own.
4,great cord reel
5,Bought to hold 50 ft of G-Force garden hose. Worked perfect.
5,its ok
2,Was hoping this product would help with outdoor cord. Too off-balance and the plastic handle to spin/wind the reel broke. Ended up in my trashcan.
5,Purchased this to use with a 100ft cord and the snow blower.  Sturdy and easy to use to prevent tangles.  It was very useful throughout the stormy 2014 Winter in the Northeast.
3,Very hard to roll. it is stiff.  Not recommended for using outdoor.  Not good for heavy gauge extension cord neither.
5,Lite ez to use works fine
1,This claims to be metal but in reality it is cheap plastic on a metal stand. Hard to hold while rolling up cord due to cranking and holding at same time while trying to get cord on reel evenly.
1,Piece of junk and doesn’t hold 100 ft of the advertised gauge. Furthermore the co includes a letter saying as soon as it’s shipped they have zero responsibility which is completely anti amazon.  It’s very difficult to reel cord bc the handle is small and footing is awkward.
5,Nice reel. Seems well made. Only had for a few weeks so far
3,serves its purpose.
1,It’s plastic! Like a kid’s toy
1,Not sturdy enough
5,Using it to store an 50' outdoor extension cord that I used for powering my lawn mower.  It seem of sturdy construction and makes frequent unspooling and spooling a breeze.
1,It's very difficult to wind without a handle
1,One of the 2 outside walls missing. Unit is unusable without it. But because of my cancer I cannot get to a post office to return it.  So I guess I am screwed.
1,I do construction and I have 100 foot extension cord I tried to reel up on this and it fell apart! It’s brand new it is very cheaply made.even if it wouldn’t have fallen apart it’s still was so flimsy it couldn’t hold 100 feet of extension cord.
5,I am very happy with the product  it is certainly very good quality . and very practical I facilitate my work. seguire definitely buy from this store amazon
1,Broke in 1 minute of using it. Cheap plastic
1,This was very sturdy - kept coming apart.
5,Excellent well made and the best thing the base is metal and not plastic. Should last me a long time.Well worth the money spent on it. Very pleased
5,Easily accommodates 100 feet of gauge 14 extension cord.  Cord rolls out easily.  The crank although a bit small works well to pull the long cord in.
1,I have been using it for more than an year now.First of all the nut on the side would get loose due to unwinding action of the spool. I solved that problem by tightening that nut and then applying epoxy around it.Secondly the winding action is just very inconvenient. Overall I don't like it and would not buy it again
2,Someday I'll figure out how this damn thing works. Until then I will use the Quick Winder I just received.This might be good for for filling up that little spot with the cheap cords I never use.
3,Would have liked a foot stand  to hold it while reeling in extension.
5,Great cord real
5,Came right away - a couple of days!  Good price
3,hard to use for 12 gauge extension cord
1,I'm pretty handy but I can't put the two wheel sections together.  The product seems to be very nice but is useless if I can't assemble it.  Very disappointed!
2,holds an extension cord very well but getting it on or off the reel is just too big a chore am going to remove the stand that just gets in the way of everything
5,Really handy to get cords cleaned up without tangles.
1,not durable at all. mostly made out of plastic. Would not recommend at all
1,Does not wind easily and the plastic is chinsy. Would not buy again.
1,the plastic reels are clumpsy.. after 50 feet of wire rolling the plastic wheel came off.  the wheels are assembled by snapping.
1,Only the frame is metal. The reel is still only plastic and flimsy. Overall a waste of money and time
1,Wheel falls off when winding cord
2,Not happy with it. Advertised capacity is off 100 feet cord will not fit. Very wobbly construction. Bad purchase would not recommend for use with any heavy duty cords
1,base is not stable. reel has a tendency to become loose and fall from the mount.  Not a product I would recommend buying.
1,Extremely poorly constricted
1,no instructions. cord over wrapped in 2 attempts resulting in a tedious and time consuming precess to unravel. it will not handle my 150 foot cord.
1,I was in the believe that this item was completely metal. only the base is. the plastic it cracks just by looking at it.
5,Awesome love it no more mess
5,Holds our 8 gauge 100 ft. cord easily without issues.
1,Arrived missing half.
2,Only use this for light duty cable heavy duty cable is too heavy for the structure
1,The first time I used it the undersized handle broke !  I have to try to put a larger handle on it or try  to return it.....To get another one like it would be useless as  the handle is too small and will pull out the first time you use it.
2,I want to like this...but it does not stay put together.  It flew apart while I was unwinding the cord which was quite frustrating.
3,Given as gift.
5,Why didn't I buy something like this years ago?  No idea. This is sturdy and easy to set up.
5,I bought this product to hold a100 foot extension cord and it works great.  It is lightweight which helps since the cord is heavy
3,Too light. Kinda useless for my purposes.
5,Well made
5,Works very well and is sturdy.
5,Works great when you put the ends together and unwind from the middle distance.  I never have to unwind the whole cord.
5,I am glad purchase this one for few more dollar then teh plastic one. It roll up the wire easily and unit build very well.
5,Great storage for electrical cord. Works perfect bought two more.
1,Thisistotalgarbage. A garden hose holder will work much better.
5,Works as advertised
1,Broke the times I pulled the cord. The entire wheel came off. A piece of crap.
1,Thought it was a good product after 1 month the plastic is begining to crack unfortunately a cheap piece of junk!
2,This thing is almost comically small.  Definitely not what I was expecting.
5,Great reel for the money. Able to keep inner end outside reel so when wound you have access to both ends!
1,This is a piece of junk. The thing won`t stay together long enough for you to roll the cord on it. Poorly designed little or no instruction. If you have a 150` cord it`s best to find something else. Mine is going in the trash!
2,Kinda difficult to use - bulky and sorta cheap.  I wouldn't buy one again.
5,An out of site organizer that has put my extension cords all in one place instead of being spawed obout under the bench
1,Garbage!! No real world use. All plasticky and flimsy. The screws always come off if you pull the chord out hard. No easy way to put the chord back in. Probably good enough for just storage of wire..I stopped using it after 2 uses..
1,Too small tough to usejust wasting my time to use . I can roll my hose faster than I can use this thing
2,No It Doesn't Hold 100 Feet of Extension Cord.  It's too SMALL!!
5,Great item
1,The cord gets tangled and is a waste of time to put into the reel.  I used it maybe once or twice and gave up.  Now it's in the pile for a future garage sale.  Wish I hadn't bought it.
1,N/A
1,Trash! Broke the second time I used it. Don’t buy
1,I do not like woods extension cord wheel. It makes it harder not easier. I have n easier time carrying the cord myself. It just tangles it up n almost damaged. My 100 ft Us Steel cord. Dont buy this. Its junk
1,It is stated here at AMAZON that reel will hold 150 feet but when I recived the reel it only hold 100 feet  !!!!!!!!!False advertisement  !!!!!!!!!!!
1,No
5,Light weight and easy to use
5,Have a 100 ft. extension chord and the Woods Chord Reel made it very easy to wind up and not get tangled.
2,works but
5,I bought this as a gift. He loved it.
1,Item was shipped with missing parts - unusable.
1,Don't buy it its for storage only not real world use.I am going to buy a cord bag that bolts to the wall that I can extend out an reel in as needed.
5,Does what it needs to do no frills
1,Very poor design. Difficult to operate smoothly. Has no wall mount capability. Came with no directions to show how to start cord end  so as not to interfere with roll up.
1,Very light duty reel.
1,Very flimsy. Used it one and while rewinding the handle broke off. Plus there's no way to secure it while winding or unwinding.
1,This thing couldn't handle my extension cord. It kept breaking in half when reeling up. Got frustrated and threw it away after the first use.
5,Great I love not having a tangled electrical cord this did the trick.
5,Great Quality!  Fast Shipping!
5,If you hate extension cords laying around everywhere in your garage this is the solution!
1,Didn't come with all the parts. Had to return. Waste of time.
1,Doesn't quite hold a 100ft cord. It often catches on the spool and the resulting mess dangles off in which every direction.
5,Works great as a reel for my RV cable wire
5,ITS HOLDS MY HEAVY DUTY EXT CORDS AND SPINS....LIFE IS GOOD
5,Very practrical
5,Excellent product great price fast shipping hope to buy from this seller again...
1,This is a complete piece of junk. I would not recommend that anyone waste their money on it.
5,good
5,GOOD
5,Great for long electrical cords. I am very satisfied especially for the price.
5,Great for storing & transporting my cord to where I need it.
5,Well built holds a 100 foot of 12/3 cable.
5,Delivered on time product matched description
1,half the size I believed it to be of no usehave it away
5,Usually assembled. Works better than I expected. Highly recommended.
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,Holds my longest cord & is easy to handle.
1,A waste of my money. doesn't neatly roll up the cord
5,i don't know how I lived without one
1,Does not work at all
5,Perfect for third party cabling applications
5,My husband loves it - very easy to use.
5,Works very good and seem to hold up.
1,Cheap quality
5,Excellent
5,MAKES COMFORTABLE CORDS
5,Did what I needed it to do.
5,Good quality light weight reasonably priced.
5,Exactly what I needed
5,as expected AAA+++
5,GREAT
5,A++++ built tough.
5,Works as expected
5,works great.
5,Easy to assemble the two pieces together.  Good enough for organizing a 50 ft extension cord.  Will buy more if needed.
5,Oh yeah . . . this little jewel wraps my 12 gauge x 100 ft. extension cord beautifully. The handle makes it easy to tote along and its lightweight and compact.
2,I like that it holds 100ft of 15 amp extension cord.  I don't like that when you extend the cord from the reel the entire reel turns (including the plug so has the extension cord is being extended the length of the cord with the plug going to the cataleptic get completely twisted.  I found that you first have to extend the cord before plugging it in but because the the lead part with the plug runs through a hole in the reel - this is extremely cumbersome.  I was of the impression from reading the Question's section - that this was similar to a garden hose reel.Now perhaps I may not be doing it correctly but I have the plug end of the extension cord attached to the reel first at the center of the reel with about a 10 foot lead with plug and the rest of the cord is rapped continuously around the reel.  As I pull the cord and the reel turns - the lead with the plug turns with it.
3,Holds 150 ft of cord but is kinda hard to wind.
4,This thing has great build quality all around.I took a star off though because the inner diameter is quite small. I was hoping to wrap multipair fiber or SDI cable with this but overestimated the diameter of the drum. The bend is too much for my tastes. At least I can use this for other uses like power cords.
4,easily holds a 100 feet of medium duty wire.
1,This thing is more trouble than its worth.  Unless you have someone helping feed the cord it constantly gets tangled as you try and wind it.  Save your $$ and just buy the $8.00 simple cord reel!!!
1,Very hard to crank due to SMALL one inch NUB they call a handle.  Flimsy Plastic spool  to roll cord on to. Oveall not a good value.
2,It seemed to work for a while but would not withstand downhole measurements in the field with constant use.  The reel kept coming off the stand  no matter how hard we tightened the nuts.  I would think this would work well for something with minimal use. Do not get for commercial heavy use.
3,While I had hoped for a better outcome upon purchasing this item I will have to see how it responds to constant use. I have 150 ft 12/3 electrical extension cord and had hoped that this Cord Reel would surfice. IT just barely handled all of my 12/3 cord. Units that can handle longer cords or heavy duty extension cord were priced at 4 to 5 times more money than this unit and I wasn't prepared to spend that kind of money just to store an extension cord. It would be nice if Amazon could find and carry a unit that handles the heaverier cords and a more reasonable price. Time will tell how this unit stands up.Rick Lane - Ontario - Canada
4,Cord Real Works As It Should but wish the winding handle was longer.  Still much better than having cord laying on the garage floor.
5,Great extension cord reel made well. Better then the all plastic ones at homedepot and lowes.
4,It is a little hard for me to handle.  It is well made and looks very durable.  If it was bolted down it would probably work great.
5,The body is metal the reel is plastic. Now knowing this I do not think it is made for commercial or heavy duty use. This being said I think it is a great item for the person who does normal household chores. I Bought one and immediately bought another to hold me 100 foot cords for the electric weed eater. It seems to hold average weight 100 foot cords just fine with extra...so 125 foot would work...150 feet might be pushing it. I actually prefer that it doesn't hold the 200 feet I need because then it would be super heavy and cumbersome. I appreciate the slots on the outside of the reel that allow you to stick the plug of the cord through for nice even winding. Put it on the ground and your feet on the metal part and reeling it in is super easy. I also like that the one side of the rubber handle is open so I can hang it on a nail on the garage wall. Simple neat and easy! Down the road I might get more for string christmas lights or rope lights.
5,Satisfied w/ product
1,This is a total piece of junk. It looks great but the first time you reel your cord the nut comes off  and the spool almost falls off. If you catch it you can stop and screw the nut back on. For a 100 foot cord you get to do that 4 times. Don't buy this.
5,That said I had 100ft of 12/3 lol.  It's physically possible but not a great fit and to do it you have to really guide the wire as it wraps for maximum threading to get a good wrap without gaps and such -- so essentially more time and effort than I would really want to spend if you pulled this out very often.Photo 1: 50ft of 12/3 (very comfortable)Photo 2: 100ft of 12/3 (pushing it)PRO:* I like the metal base; it's solid and sturdy and doesn't wobble around a lot when you wind like the plastic ones I've tried do.* It's good for what it's advertised for - I have every confidence that it would adequately fit 100' of 14/3 or higher gauge wire* Pretty decent price ($17.68 at time of review) for a metal based unit - plenty of plastic units out there costing moreCON:* If you're buying this for 100 ft of 12/3 I think it might be a stretch and I probably wouldn't bother if it was something you pulled out and used on a regular basis.  If you use it rarely the care and attention needed to wind it carefully enough to get it to fit may be worth it.* I'd really have liked if they had increased the diameter about another inch... I think that would have given it just the umph it needed to be a more confident option for 12/3 wire... and they could have marketed it as such* The winding knob is a bit chintzy and small I think they could have made this a bit larger to get a good grip on.* The winding wheel itself I though was a bit weaker than I'd have liked to see and a bit of a disappointment after making the effort of such a nice base.QUALIFIER ON THE CONSAnd this is the reason I'm not dinging the stars despite the somewhat negative sounding cons... I'm using the product for other than it's intended purposes and ratings.  I imagine that if I weren't using it for such a stiff gauge wire the sides wouldn't seem all that weak (and in any case no worse than any of the other plastic models I've used) and I wouldn't be looking for a larger more solid knob.All that said... I actually liked this and since my 100ft of 12/3 is really (2) 50's I think I'm going to get another and just roll them separately
4,Fantastic product for being as cheap as it is. The cylinder is plastic but the base is metal. I love that the base is connected to the cylinder only on one side. This makes it easy to leave some excess cable on the open side so you don’t have to unspool the entire cable with each use.I will definitely be purchasing more. Perfect for church cable management.
5,Great little cord reel. I use it for my 100 ft long cord for my electric mower. Very easy to use. What a time saver. And since it keeps the cord from getting all tangled up when I move it I am not sputtering pirate words the entire time I am mowing. ; )
5,Didn't end up keeping it because I bought for someone and they decided they didn't need it. But I did check it out and it looked just like shown and seemed to be good quality! It is kind of small but should be fine for a normal extension cord.
5,This overall is great. the one thing that is missing is a holder for the pigtail of the cord sticking out. As you roll up the cord you are whipped with the leading end of the cord
5,I order this for my 100ft HDMI cord for my out door home theater. It was exactly what I needed for a faster clean up.. awesome!
5,Excellent transaction item as described quick delivery. Thank you!
5,This makes rolling up an extension cord quick and easy.
5,👍
5,it was what I was looking for
1,I received a unit that was missing paint and rusted. No joke. What’s with that?
5,light and sturdy frame !
5,Cheap little chord reel but feels sturdy. I use both of mine  to hold a 100’ air hose as well as a 150’ extension chord. A+
5,Perfect!!!I would highly recommend.Great quality.
4,For garage and limited use - Great! For on the job use - Not as sturdy
1,This keep falling down as you take wire out from it and very light weight. I need something sturdy that stands on its on while pulling wire from it.
1,UPDATE; i used this reel for the second time today amd as i unreeled the cord the reel fell apart in my hands. I don't expect alot for what i paid but it should last more than one use.It holds 100 feet of 12 gauge cable! I'm going to build a sturdy base out of some 2 x 4's to make it a bit more stable on account of the weight of the cord and trying to hold the reel and reel in the cord at the same time. All in all i'm satisfied.
4,Going to mount this on a piece of wood to make it easy to reel in. 80 feet of cord fit on it nicely.
5,Yes use it rolling up drop cord the cord is 75 foot long and had plenty of room
5,I really like the product
4,Easy to use
5,We had the plastic reels of this type but were  fragile and broke. I saw some of the other reviews mentioned about the plastic parts but it for me it works well winds smooth and I am happy with it in fact I just ordered 3 more for the other cords around.
4,Comes apart fairly easily and feels a little flimsy but decent for the money.  75' of 10 Guage more than fills it up.
5,I needed for a way to store 100m (330') Christmas light strings. The cardboard spools they came on were falling apart and too small. I was underwhelmed by spools being sold specifically for storing light strings. I have never been able to take down and store holiday lights so quickly and neatly. This thing was very much worth its price.
5,Never used one of these before so watched a video.  Hardest part was figuring out how to use it.  Most importantly the cord unwinds smoothly so you don’t have to stop and adjust or untangle the cord.  Really a timesaver.  It is lightweight and makes using my leaf blower vacuum mulcher easy to use. I can go all over the area with no problems.
5,I was a little skeptical after reading a review that it would not hold 100 ft cord and after I put it together it looked extremely small but held the 100 ft cord with plenty of room to spare.
5,This is a great product easy to use and sturdier then I expected with a steel frame. and heavy plastic reel...Took 100' of cord in minutes and solved an aggravating problem and for only $16Highly recommend this reel
4,It is made of strong metal and good plastic! Pretty easy to use! The only drawback is the it doesn’t provide a place to hold plug so the plug turn with the reel! You will hurt yourself when you turn fast! After all it is still a good product!
4,Great value considering the other option and price points 👍.  Good quality 👌.
1,It’s serves it’s purpose but nut very sturdy if it was 1 solid piece would be better. But when you buy from Chinese super store what do you expect.
1,Fell to pieces as I tried to wind my 100' power cord. Useless waste of money.
5,cord is not tangled any more. No more taking knots out to use cord.  And all you have to do is roll the cord up with the handle you simple turn and it rolls up
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 So I didnt use this for an extension cord as you can see it has multiple uses.Very happy with purchase!!!
5,Easily accommodates 120 feet of cable
5,After working in the Amazon Jungle (eh my mom’s yard) all day in the heat the WORST part is winding up the heavy extension cord… my arms are already killing me from holding the lawn equipment for hours. This made it 1000% easier so lightweight  and simple! The best part is when I go to use the cords again they are not all twisted up. I love love love this! Such a simple solution to a difficult task!
5,nice as described.
5,Well I was skeptical when it arrived....but whoop there it is. That is 100 foot heavy duty contractors cord 15A rolled up on the reel. It took a moment to whined it up. Had to make sure it was tight on the reel just guided it as I spun it around. It holds the heavy thick cord with no problem. I ordered 2 because I have 2 of these cords. (they are for my hurricane needs)  Very happy with the cord reels. Didn't cost a fortune and it has cleaned up the cord clutter. Happy Camper
4,This electrical extension cord wheel is not 100% made from metal.  The wheels are made from plastic.  Everything else is made from metal.  Overall good price and hopefully will last.
5,50' tuyau a air pvc  très bien!
5,Musique
4,Well it certainly is a lot smaller than I anticipated but it seems to do the job.  As you can see by the picture it easily holds the 100 foot 12 gauge extension cord.  As I was winding it onto the spool I never thought in a million years it would all fit.  It did to my amazement.  For the price I’m pleased with it as it sure beats having 100 feet of cord all strewn around and tangled on your garage floor.
1,Junk. Junk absolute junk it looks like a decent sizeable reel.It states metal. Its half plastic.The entire reel is made of cheap plastic with cheap snap cips holding it together. Then a tiny piece of plastic on the reel that you are supposed to reel the cord in with. Honestly you could probably do better at the dollar store. That is saying something.Some people buy this for storage. Just use a nail or hook on the wall. Very dissatisfied with this purchase Amazon.The seller should be ashamed for false advertising.If I could give negative stars I sure would.
3,Reel winds up and out easily. The only issue I encountered was that I will need to use an extra 6 ft ext chord from The male end to plug into the outlet. I tried to leave the extra line but it got in the way when trying to use the reel. So by using an extra 3ft to 6 ft ext chord and plugging it in once the cord is extended or when finished and need to retract the cord that will resolve that problem.
2,Arrived yesterday in a large box but I was very suspicious when I picked it up because it really didn't feel like it had anything in it. When I opened it I saw a very cheap looking device that I'd be very surprised if it lasted a week. Why big window? I have a feeling the seller has one so he can easily see people coming from a long way off.Edit: Confirmed today that it is a complete piece of junk. The title is misleading saying that it is metal when the only piece that is metal is the tubing that the plastic wheel sits on. The plastic is flimsy and not nearly adequate for the job. To say that I'm a little peed off would be an understatement.
5,It fit my 100ft 13 gauge with room to spare (see photo). I bought both this one and a plastic one.  This metal one feels much studier and well made.I put one foot on the bottom bar easily clip the female end into the middle shaft clip then rotate with one hand while feeding the cord with my other hand.  It rotates smoothly so you can actually wind it very quickly. Wear gloves of courseMy original order came with one half missing. Contacted Amazon and they promptly sent a replacement.5 stars!
1,Unit is cheap plastic and the handle broke after a year.  Says it can handle 150 ft cable but I have problems with just 100ft cable and even then you need to wind the cable perfectly even.I would say this can handle 75ft cable or less with minimal fuss not the 150ft cable advertised.Overall Don't bother getting this
5,I bought it in Nov 2017 and still use it. The more I used it the more I like it.I have a very long power cord. In the beginning I am not quite familiar with it. As I get used to it I can roll and unroll it very quickly. The trick is you need to adjust the direction you are facing so that the cord is always in your back.Since it is made of metal and has weight it gives you a sturdy feeling although you do need to step on its support sometimes.overall no complaints.
3,The title is a little misleading - the only metal thing about this reel is the stand the spool itself is made of brittle plastic. It did not come with instructions but I figured it's pretty obvious how this thing works - well I was wrong. After searching around and finding videos on YouTube I think I have it figured out. Overall it serves the basic purpose of keeping the cord tidy and if you reel it correctly you can keep it on the spool using only the length of cord you need.
1,Do not waste your time or money buying this pos. I purchased to use for snowblower as it Says it’s metal. Mostly all plastic. No handle to speak of. Takes longer to reel up than just using your arm. Manufacturer should be run out of business for pushing such cheap crap. Cannot believe Amazon would promote this garbage. Going to have to think twice before ordering anything from Amazon again as not very impressed with their involvement with this junk.Please do not buy and be left with an unnecessary expense for junk as I did
4,Overall I'm very happy with this purchase. It sure beats the cracked and flimsy plastic pot that I was using to store my extension cords previously. Very easy and fast to assemble. And as other reviewers have indicated it's pretty surprising to see how much extension you can neatly roll up. Good value at a decent price. Only negative for me is the handle used to rotate the reel feels weak compared to the other parts. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets knocked off and goes missing if used in a rough way.
3,I bought this because the reviews said it holds a lot of extension cord. I have 100 ft of 12 gauge extension cord and I was really surprised that it did hold this much 12 gauge cord. However the handle is really small so I had to make a larger handle to make it easier to reel in the cord. The frame is light weight tubular steel the rest of it is plastic. You have secure the unit in order to pull out the cord otherwise it falls over. I secure it to my bench vice then pull and reel the cord. Frankly it's a bit of a pain.
5,Very Easy to set up. I used a 100ft 12 gauge cord and it fits just fine. It's made of platic but is sturdy enough. It took a while to come though I didn't mind. the packaging was fine without damage. using this is way better than having on the floor and tangled. Would reccomend. People complain about the male end being hard to pull out to use but if you just leave a little out when you set it up you'll be fine.
5,Useful as expected.  Holds easily 100ft of 14/2 gauge wire and is extremely easy to reel.It's kind of light so I use to keep it in place by stepping on the bar althoug it's not a big deal as I said is good enough for its price.Just used the tip from another reviewer and reel the cord from the centre in a double cable way fashion.  It's really fast and easy just be sure to unreel all or most of the cord before using.I'm really happy with this product and would buy it again.
1,Product says its suitable for a hose but is not at all. It's too small for a hose reel and is extremely hard to reel in with something as thick as a hose on it
4,Used for emergency generator extension cords.  Unit has a good metal handle but should be known that the actual reel is plastic.  Has to be partially assembled.  A good amount of force is needed to snap the two plastic pieces together.  Has to be held down when using due to the light weight.  Overall good unit if not using every day.
2,The description says "hold up to 150 feet of 12 14 and 16/3 Gauge cords" but the label on the product says it can only hold 100 feet. I tried it and it can barely hold 100 feet of 12 gauge.Looks just like the picture but the plastic is feels cheap. Totally not worth $26. Feels like a $5 dollar product.No instruction on how to reel the extension cord.
3,This reel sort of works but it isn't really that convenient for reeling cords. The handle for the reel is kind of small which makes it hard to grip when I am wearing gloves. I use this mostly to manage my outdoor extension cord for my snow blower in the winter so wearing gloves is a must. I risk frost bite by taking off my gloves to handle this reel in the winter.
5,The reel has done a wonderful job of reducing the clutter and cumber of carrying my Costco 100ft 12/3 Outdoor extension cord. Makes it easy to carry and store. Build is sturdy enough metal frame and plastic wheel. I think the best way to attach the cable to the two hooks is in the middle of your cable means you reel up half as much no tangles either. It isn't always easy possible to secure the cord end into the side holes. It would be nice to have rubber on the bottom of the stand.
3,Like other reels there was no spec on the length of 12 guage cord it would hold so I took the chance bought it for my 30 meter 12 guage cord. Turns out it just fit as long as it is wound up reasonably tidy.The frame is metal; the sides are plastic and seems sturdy enough.Disappointed in the product description - not enough detail. I would have preferred metal sides.
1,I bought this to organize my cords but seems to be more trouble using it rather then rolling it up by hand. The handle kept coming off and now the handle is broken and is very clumsy to spin without it!
3,I didn't read the description of this product carefully and I assumed that the whole thing is made with metal.  Not true!  Only the stand is metal but the plates that snap together to hold the cord is made with looks like cheap plastic.  I am very disappointed.  I still give it 3 stars for the metal part.  Due to the plastic component I am not sure how long this product will last...
4,Had no issues gathering a 50ft cord for me. I've only had it for a few weeks and so far all is pretty good. One star is left out since I only wish that it had a design where the main (power source ) plug  could be permanently plugged in so that we didn't have to undo the whole cord to use it every time.
5,I wasn't sure that this would hold my indicated extension cord but I am happy to report that it does so and with a little room to spare i.e. the rolled up cord sits slightly below the rim.I was unsure because there were conflicting reviews about 100' of 12 or 13 gauge cord fitting/not fitting on the reel and the ones that said it would fit didn't indicate whether theirs had the ground wire.As other have said one does have to roll up the cord in a tidy manner i.e. much like a machine would spool but that really takes no big effort.
2,Great to roll up the extension cable to put away.  Unfortunately it came apart during the unravelling of the extension cable.  It's a light weight reel so if you're unravelling the cable it will come towards you as you pull for more slack.
5,like many others have said there is no way you can fit a cord as long as they claim.  I have a 50' and it's almost at the limit.  Sure it'S a pretty big gauge but even if you reduce it my half in terms of diameter that's still short of what they claim.Other than that it's great I just ordered a second one
2,I don’t often write negative reviews on Amazon but this is a Hunk. Of. Junk. It says it is made for 100ft but I have 50ft hose and could barely wrap the whole thing. It is quite small and I don’t think sturdy enough to maneuver the windup action. Very disheartened by this purchase.
5,This reel takes 3 square feet of tangled cord and puts it into a compact coil with a handle. It also unreels straight and untwisted ready for use. I purchased a second one after I tried the first one. Now pondering a third...
4,Fairly easy to use but just make ure not to spool it up too fast or it can get tangled and cause a nightmare. Makes cord management immensely less stressful quite satisfied.
5,Easy to assemble and it takes my 50ft cord without problem. Always had a tangled up cord in my garage. Now it's easy to use and to store.Very impressed and seems very sturdy. Would highly recommend it.
4,It is terrible!  It takes too long to wind cord back up and plug just flaps around.  I will use it until I purchase a better one and that is the" only reason" I haven't thrown it in the garbage.  But I will be.
1,There is a nut that holds the reel to the stand but it keeps coming undone and then the reel falls off.  Not well designed.
4,it was a bit different from what I thought but it is still good quality. was unaware of the v grove design  as I use for coiling fiber optic cable and needed it to coil smooth from left to right but I should have known better
3,I am quite unhappy with this product. It does indeed have the capability to roll up 100 ft. cord but it is flimsy. The difficulty lies in trying to roll up the initial few feet of cord onto the stand - it does not grab the cord well continues to spin without loading and is very very frustrating to use.
5,For years I had my extension cord sitting in random corners of my garage looking like a hot mess! This product is perfect and wrapped up my 50ft cable perfectly! Couldn’t ask for a better product!
4,Does a good job of coiling.  The only thing negative is the retaining nut comes to lose and is awkward to tighten.  I found the price is about right for this item as the quality is good.
5,Works well.  The frame is metal and the reel is plastic.  The reel turns smoothly and easily to wind or unwind your cord.  Instead of unwinding your cord completely get another extension cord to connect to the cord on the reel.  Faster and easier than unreeling the entire cord everytime.
1,Description is wrong. Cannot hold 150ft of 1214 gauge. Paper on product says 100 ft of 14 gauge. It’s really small
2,If the wheel were an inch larger in diameter in would work well for 100 feet of 12 guage.  I can get 100 feet on it but the last few feet are more difficult than they should be.
5,Nice way to roll and store power cords. The only reason it does not get full marks is the handle for cranking up the cable. It is too small and makes roll up less “fun” than it should be
5,J’utilise l’enrouleur avec une extension 12/3 de 100 pieds et il est bien rempli. Très simple a monter et utiliser. Très pratique pour transporter mon extension.
3,Really I didn't expect much more with this purchase on first attempt to roll an extension cord up the little handle on the reel broke but other than that it is what it is. Not worth the time or money!
4,It's pretty good I was able to fit (barely) a 100ft 12ga extension cord (gotta roll it up very nicely though). The sides are plastic though so doesn't feel very strong but let's see how long it will hold up.
2,The only way I've found to wrap up a cord with this doesn't function that well. The Male end gets stuck with each turn making it a more tedious process than wrapping the cord by hand. Maybe I'm doing it wrong but there is no instructions so I will never know.
5,Well constructed and easy to use. The attached pictures are with 100 feet of 12/3 extension cord. I'm satisfied with the results.
2,Item scratched upScrew on handle is high above handle grip this can cut one hand while using it.This item will go rust within a couple months with the paint all scratched up cheap paint job on it.
2,There is a nut to hold the reel to the stand.Each time I use it  the nut  came out and then the reel falls off.  I have to fix it at the cold outside.  It is real annoy.
5,Probably the most compact way of storing a 100 foot 12/3 12 awg cord.  Recommended as long as your cord isn't overly thick.  It just fits as long as you wind cord nicely.
1,I was initially pleased but it broke within a couple of months.  And that was with just light around the yard usage once every week or two.  :-(
1,Disliked product disliked customer serrvice
4,Came well packaged.Need for use larger out side cord for garden lawn and car vacuum cleaner and car washer.  BINGO! VERY GOOD!
2,When retracting the electrical cord the end you put through the side to plug into a power source just swings around and gets twisted.  Sometimes gets caught between the handle.  Poor design.
4,The frame is metal but the sides are plastic. Feels more flimsy than it looks. Does the job though.
4,Liked the reel but the handle to rewind the cord is small and a little difficult to wind. It hold the #14 or 16 wire with room to spare.
3,The side crank came off almost immediately. It’s plastic so not really a surprise but I would expect to be a little bit more sturdy.
5,Strong unit and easily stores my 75’ extension cord. Sure beats the old arm rewind and simple to pull cord out or rewind.
4,I liked the unit.  It did what was advertised it should i.e held a 100 yd extension cord. However the ad said it was metal but the sides holding the cord in place are plastic.  This doesn't seem to detract from the unit.  I felt it did what I wanted and did it well.
2,the weight is ok. it easy to use but every time need to unplug the cord when i rotate the wire. it is make like plastic. not very sturdy
5,When the product first came I was disappointed..  I said to my self there is no way my thick gauge 50' extention cord would fit on that...  After assembly I started to reel it with the cord....  I was shocked at how easy it was to roll it up and the cord kept on going and going..  Low and behold the 50 thick gauge cord fits in that small reel like a glove.  Super easy to understand real it as well. Definitely a good buy
1,Does not hold 150 meters of lawn cord as mentioned.
4,For light use only. The way its made its a little flimsy. Good value for the price.
5,Using it for 100' 12/3 extension cord.Great quality and value!Much better than plastic reels.
4,Doesn't quiet work right for heavier gauge wire extension like 10/12AW. Better suited for regular 16/14AW extensions.
5,I use mine for Cat 5 data cable. It fits 150 feet perfectly. Will buy 2 more for my other data cables.
4,can roll up a 100ft 12 gauge cord... but you need to guide the cord reeling... overall good product
5,we don't have a mess with the cord now. Its made of metal and sturdy. I tried other reels and returned them because the design was flawed on those. This one has enough space for both ends of the cord which works very well
5,Perfect for cord.  It’s light weight can be tricky if you have to pull from a distance.
5,I bought this because I was tired of using a hand reel for my old extension cord that has been seeing a lot of use this summer. It works beautifully!
4,This is a lightweight product but the price was right.  Does what it is supposed to and no more tangled cord.
5,Easy to use. Nice and compact. Strong metal material. Easy to wind up.
5,Really nice for extension cord  no more tangled cords for me light weight easy to assemble
4,Handle a little too close to reel for my liking. If you use 12/3 wire it will not fit 100 feet. Will fit 75 feet 12/3
4,Works well but would have been nice if a cable quite were attached.
4,It is not a metal reel. Its a plastic reel with a metal handle.Not suitable for outdoor 12/3 50 foot.I'm sure its fine for smaller cord and home use.Item was returned.
4,Winds up cable fast. Fits 100 ft 16 gauge or 150 ft 14 gauge as per included instructions which was all I needed but different from description.
2,I thought I was getting a steel reel as advertised but only the frame is steel. The reel itself is plastic.
1,Beaucoup trop compacte ca jam et ca tourne mal... Prendre un autre produit
1,So lightweight it’s useless.Fell apart it’s garbage.
4,Fits my 100 foot extensions just fine but it is metal frame and plastic reel.
3,It is sturdy enough but small therefore hard to roll the electric cord around. Still better then a bucket to store your electric cord. Overall it's good
4,Price is good. Base metal solid reel is plastic - a bit flimsy but wound 150’ of extension cord with no problem.
5,It is lightweight however I would have like it a bit heavier as it moves when rolling empty/almost empty.
5,Perfectly suitable for keeping cords neatly stored. True not a heavy-duty stand for a professional site but works fine for extension cords for the hand tools and garden tools.
4,tout est correcte reste à savoir si la robustesse sera là.
3,It's very basic there's only a plastic nut that keeps the large spool on the metal base and I find that it frequently comes off when in used to reel in the extension cord
5,Had all these cords hanging around all twisted up. Very easy to roll up in this stand. Now all the cords are well organized and easy to pull out when needed. A very happy purchase.
5,Small and Compact and easier holds 75 to 100' cords.
5,Peut facilement enrouler une rallonge de 100' de calibre 10.  Très bon achat.
3,Pour des extention du commerce le note de pieds qu on peut rouler est correspondantPour une extenton industriel no 12  75 pieds est le maximum
3,This is a very lightweight reel not suitable at all for anything but light cords and without clamping or bolting it down its not easy to use
2,Really cheap. When trying to roll it not steady enough for the cord to follow
5,Convient avec une rallonge de 100'#12 eavy dutty
4,GREAT !! Holds 100 ft cord  no problem !!
3,A bit flimsy but holds a 100 ft 12 AWG just fine
5,Excellent quality. Makes life easier
5,Best const-benefit option by far. Have two sets of 13A 75ft cord extension on it (150ft total). Really works as advertised. Definitely deserves 5 starts.
5,Al principio creí que era muy pequeño a pesar de todo logré enrollar 35 m de cable de uso rudo 2 x 12 AWG. Lo recomiendo ampliamente!!
3,Junk . 2 stars. Wouldn't buy again
4,Have not used yet but it looks to be as advertised. Once I use it maybe I will rate it higher.
4,Functional. It is a bit too light-weight. When I wheel the cable in with the handle the whole unit flops around.
4,It's smaller than expected but I don't regret buying it. The messy wires are finally arranged.
4,Very good product. Allows cord to be wound quickly and smoothly. Works better than my other - more expensive - reels.
5,sturdy cord Reel. high quality. recommended.
3,The description is misleading.  It is a plastic reel on a metal stand.  The crank handle is a bit too short to be easily used.  It works.  It does the job.
4,not able to hold the cords
5,Works with 12 gauge 30 ft extension cord. Nicely made but the winding knob seems to be a little bit flimsy. Will see for a while 5 stars.
2,Too light. Have to put foot on it to avoid dangling. Use it but so so
5,ok for home owner not for industrial
3,Plastic material are very cheap not sturdiness. My gauge cord is low ( I mean big diameter) but anyway.
4,Work well good quality for the price
5,Very sturdy and strong.
4,Seems to be a good product for the price.  Arrived quickly.  Lightweight and easy to put together.
4,Won't hold suggested length and gauge but very useful regardless.
5,I am very impressed with this cord reel. It is perfect for my 12 guage 50ft utility cord. Rolls up nicely and durable.
5,Very nice perfect & easy to use
5,Facile à enrouler et à transporter
2,Flimsy only good for light cord

4,No instructions on how to use it.
5,This item is great.
3,For this cheap price the overall quality is okay for me.
5,Bonne qualité pour le prix.
5,Works exactly as advertised. Just have to pay attention to how you spool the wire.I put the plug in end in first on the outside and start winding from there.
4,Does the job as described. Might not hold as long a cable as advertised. A little bit hard to handle by one person but not impossible.
5,It’s perfect
4,Nice simple cord reel. Snaps together in seconds and it's ready to go.
5,Très bon achat je recommande A+ pour le prix ça vaut vraiment la peine !
4,Ok
3,Very small reel. Does the trick but you get what you pay for.
5,A good tool for storing wires
5,Very nice
5,A+
4,A bit on the light side. Would prefer heavier.
4,I winded up the electric cord. I like the metal stand. Its too bad it is not fully metal made.
5,Works well with small cords
5,Très bon! Très pratique! Cela me convient très bien!! Satisfait!!
5,i recommand
5,I was expecting it heavier but it works. I only have to use my foot to hold it and I'm good to go. Very good price as well retailers can't bet that price
2,useless  don't buy it
4,works ok
4,Bon produit pour le bricoleur. Au sortir de la boite il parait un peut petit et léger mais une fois assemblé il supporte très bien ma lourde extension de 100pi calibre 12.
5,Large enough to keep 20ft air hose from DeWalt kit with compressor and nailer.
2,Extremely cheap plastic. Very little use already broke

5,Très utile pour enrouler un fil électrique.

5,Great product for storing electrical extension cords.
5,Très utile beau matériel de qualité.
5,Is a good way to store your long cable. It looks good on the shelve too.
5,Serves its purpose. Works well

3,Its ok for the price you pay.
5,100feet of thick 12/3 cord went on nice nice!
5,Very robust design.
1,unusable when cord is long
5,Good product
5,Without spending a lot I can now keep our electrical cord from getting tangled up.
3,trop petit pour un fil de grosseur 12/3
5,Bon produit de construction robuste.
5,Works well. For the price for this product you can't go wrong with it!

5,Good product but to pricy .. I am good
5,Used for heavy duty 150' electrical cord. Works well.
2,Did not fit my extension cord.  A good description of the size of the reel for gauge and length of cord would help
5,Works great.
1,Cheap plastic will break very easily. Not worth the money.
1,it is too small and i have a hard time using it my cord every time
5,Good reel stand to store extention cable.
5,Vraiment de qualité! Merci
4,The two sides simply would not "quick snap" together.  It took using my foot with my body weight to get the two sides to clip together.I have a 100ft 12/3 gauge cord used for my lawn mower etc that gets a lot of use in the summer.  My shoulder was not happy rolling it up the usual way and I figured a reel would save me a lot of time and pain.  Okay it did take the whole 100 ft (barely) and with so fiddling and fighting but it isnt the easiest thing to use especially with the small  handle.  I would have liked a way to leave 3ft or so of the male end exposed so I could plug it in and reel out the cord as needed.  As the label says to completely roll the cord off before using it I guess this is part of the reason why.All in all i'll probably end up use it for winter cord storage because it took me more time rolling up the cord than it did using my shoulder :(
4,good the only problem is too light I have to step on it to keep it stable.
4,I havent used it yet but I'm sure it will be great for my extension cord.
5,👍
5,It's great just what I need
2,not practical; the cable cannot rewind easily or evenly.
2,Light weight Nut falls off when reeling cord. A lot of plastic . Not for me.
3,Very light not too sturdy. Good for camping
2,Works ok I guess. But very lightweight
4,Holds 200 feet of cord ... smooth operation on recovery of cord
4,bonne fabrication
5,I bought 2 for my 12/3 100' cordsPerfect
3,Le rouleau en plastique  un peu décevant
5,Great
1,Not worth the cost
5,Very functional.
5,Simple and serves the purpose.
5,Exactly what I want.
5,As described
3,It's OK but not what I was looking for .
4,so far so good
5,Very nice at low price.
3,wheel is plastic
5,Yes
1,One if the clip is broken
5,Très solide et très pratique!
4,fast delivery and the product was exactly as described
3,Just OK
4,Works great! But doesnt have autlets
5,Good Item
4,Solid.  Great value.
1,Quality is bad
3,Not bad for the price.
3,Just ok
5,Excellent
4,easy to use. good for the price.
2,Isn't robust enough to hold heavy wire. Also the base kept coming off while rotating.
2,Light duty only.  Metal frame plastic wheel
1,Not made correctly and difficult to wrap without pulling the other end of the cord.  NO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO WRAP A CORD AND HAVE THE END PLUGGED INTO THE POWER SOURCE STAY WHERE IT SHOULD.
3,Decent product but it tends to fall on the side when pulling the cord. So perhaps more intended to walk around rolling / un-rolling cord. Or maybe if you attach to a heavy base (like a brick or piece of wood). I suspect this must happen with all the other "budget" cord reels out there since you'd need a heavy / larger base to ensure it stays in place sturdy. But a 100' cord fits nicely.
2,Not as expected.
5,Light. Easy to use. Accommodates 100 ft of 12/3 cord.
1,Instant return. Opened it and put it together. Was very skeptical about it holding 100 ft of cord. While I was wrapping the cord the plastic nut fell off and I had to put it back on the spindel.Do not waste your money on this.
1,I thought it would be much larger and heavier duty given the price.
4,Very sturdy and functional. Worth buying
3,I thought it would be easy with the electric lawn mower the cord does get tangled a bit but it's still better than that long cord loose on the lawn.  I should have gotten an expensive retractable unit.
1,Fell apart the day i got it. The only metal is the stand otherwise its flimsy plastic. Wouldent even hold a 50' cable. Dont waste your time with this item.
5,Bon rapport qualité prix mais un peu frêle pour du calibre 12 et 14.
5,A plastic item but I think it can be used several years.
5,sturdy and lightweight at the same time...perfect for my needs.  will recommend.
3,It works but didn't hold up well. The spoil would fall off periodically.
1,This unit is a piece of junk. Maybe good for winding old fishing line.
4,J'ai enroulé une extension 12/3 100pi. Je trouve ça un peu faible pour cette grosseur d'extension mais ça bien été. Ça permet un meilleur rangement.
4,La poignée pour rouler le fils a brisée dans le premier mois d'utilisation. Est-ce que la compagnie peut me faire livrer une nouvelle poignee
4,Not very sturdy when you start to wind it up.
1,I bought this because it was linked by Amazon to be used with Snow Joe snowblower. It's way too small to hold 100 feet of heavy duty cord.This item should not be linked by Amazon in thi way.
1,The product says the reel can hold 150ft of cable... the one I received says 100ft. Lucky my extension chord is only 50ft because it's close to full! There is no way this can hold 100 or even 150ft of chord!!!within one use the nut that was holding the reel on the stand came off. I had to screw it back on.It's definitely not worth the money!
3,Plastic junk
1,Takes longer to take the electrical cord off and back on this reel than the time you actually use the cord. Only useful for long term storage not everyday use.
3,The frame is made out of metal but the drum is made out of plastic.  The plastic nut that hold the drum to frame keeps loosen itself.  It must be because I wind the cable counterclockwise.  Even I wind the cable clockwise I think the nut will come loose when unwind it for use.  Will give that a try.
4,Fits a 12G 100ft extension cord. The handle is very small to reel it up so I use the slots on the side to spin it. It also doesn't want to unwind when it's plugged in so maybe it's more for storage than while the tool is in use.
1,Product fall apart after a few times of use not recommended.
5,The difficulty with assembly that some reported wasn't too bad. I just put it horizontally on the floor and pressed firmly in the middle. It clipped securely and it feels very solid. I'm using it in a corrosive environment so the plastic wheel was an asset. The frame itself will likely corrode but for the price that's acceptable.
5,It’s nice and full fills it’s purpose. I use it for my trimmer. Coil the wire back up. Looks nice and organized. Worth the price. You have to untangle the whole wire to use it.
5,Meh like most say here it's a metal tube frame and plastic.  I was hoping to find an auto reel but no dice.  For the price it's worth it
3,I had to drill my own hole in the centre of the spindle so that the female plug would feed through in the middle of the spool so it does not interfere with winding.  I noticed other spools are not designed like this either and people have to drill their own holes. I am guessing it’s because someone has a patent to the hole in the spool technique and these manufacturers can’t use it.
1,Only the frame is metal  the reel is plastic .I had to modify it to be useful and less frustrating .There is no spot for the short male end of the wire to sit so you can plug in if you leave a foot of slack it just gets in the way . I added pegs to wrap around (1/4-20 screws with washers and Lock nuts).Also there is no guide for the wire being wrapped up so it likes to get caught on either side and tangled up.  I fixed this problem as well with a 2" strap and coupling .
1,Misleading but technically true title. The parts of the reel that matter are cheap plastic. I am not returning because I can still use it to store the cord for now.You should avoid this and get something good.
5,Il faut le laisser à la chaleur au soleil avant de l’assembler car le plastique est assez rigide.
1,First and foremost this cord reel is NOT metal. Parts of the handle “contain” metal. This product is 90% plastic. Furthermore the capacity is severely limited… the spool maxed out at 70ft of 12/3 cord. Returning this junk immediately!! Misleading from start to finish. Trust the recent reviews you will be disappointed!
5,It is light and well fabricated
5,Easy to use. Solid.  The nut holding the reel to the shaft can come loose and fall off.  It is easily reinstalled.
5,Easy to use and much easier than my previous reel. I have 85 foot #12 for 13A lawnmower. The frame is metal and spool is plastic but my previous plastic reel lasted 15 years so I don’t have a concern at this point.  WoI would recommend.
2,Was surprised to see my metal cable reel is half plastic - not mentioned in add at all.  Pretty cheap and junky.  Would not recommend.
4,Item was a little smaller than expected
3,It seems like it's going to work.  The cable is stowed neatly.The initial assembly looks simple and is eventually simple but I needed to try several times to get it to fit.  I have no idea what I did differently to get it to go together.  Everything was aligned the right way.  I was almost going to use a sledgehammer but that would have been a bad idea probably.I didn't realize at first that the cable has to be attached by the middle so that as you unroll it it is extending both ends of the cable so that spool always stays in the middle rather than staying at the wall outlet end or at the distant appliance end.I have 12 gauge cable which was slightly damaged when I attached it to the spool because the little hook doesn't have enough room but at least it's in there.
4,I think it will do what I need it to. I only use my cord a few times a year.
1,Very bad quality product broken in a day!!!
2,As written above.
1,Cheap quality.Did not work for me.I'll return it.
2,Kept coming apart and i never got the hose around it.  I should have returned it right away.
4,Seems to work as it should
4,Fait la job mais n'est pas de très haute qualité pour le maison c'est parfait mais je n'irai pas sur un chantier avec ça.
2,The item is very thin plastic . It will break very easily when it is frozen during winter.
1,Plastic on the side comes out when you roll you have to screw it back.Is bendy and cheap overall.Might be ok with small extension.
5,Handy
5,Très pratique et efficace. Ma corde de 75 pieds se roule bien.
3,1 out of the 6 taps that are used to snap the two wheels together is broken right out of the box but so far the other 5 taps seem to hold the wheel together so whatever. I have 100 feet 12 gauge extension cable from Costco and it is right around the maximum capacity the last few feet is likely to just fall out from the wheel but it's ok I usually leave some not winded anyways.Do note unless you fix one end of the cable on the wheel itself it will not unwind like a tape measure. Took me 2-3 uses to figure out an efficient way to use it but in the end with some wire tie good enough.
3,It is too small to roll up 100 feet of electrical cable and uncomfortable to do it.
3,Not very sturdy ok for light weight cord
1,Wobbles too much when trying to roll up cord.
1,The center plastic bolt broke and now the spindle won't stay on.
1,It's light weight but horrible to get the cord out and in. Tangles bad awkward to use do not reccomend.
1,Very low quality.
1,This is crap.... goes back....
5,as advertised.
1,I thought this would make it easy to store a long extension cord. In practice it’s difficult to wind the cord onto the reel and - worse - it broke during my first use.
1,Reel come in used and only have half part. Amazon qc is going downhill. Will consider buy locally in the future. This goes back to Amazon.
1,Broken very quickly. Cheap quality.
3,I just received this and pretty certain it will store my 100-foot 12-gauge extension cord. Assembly was easy the issue I have it says heavy duty metal and the actual sides and core are hard plastic. Only the handle and stand are metal
5,GOOD
5,Nice products very easy to use will buy it again.Thanks
1,This thing is cheap. the reel part is plastic. Only the handle is metal. I've got 100 feet of 12 gauge on it and it barely fits. Barely room to grab the handle after its wound. No way it could fit 150 12 gauge like it says in the description..Very flimsy. I'm sending it back
