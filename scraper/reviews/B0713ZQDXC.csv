5,I took a new job visiting patient homes and needed a hands free phone mount for navigation. This item fits well in the CD slot in my 2010 Subaru Outback and holds the phone at a helpful height. It fits securely and doesn't affect the CDs playing. I have a Samsung Galaxy A42 that fits fine in this holder. With the phone in place the small LCD radio display in this car is partly blocked but that isn't a big deal to me. I have to tilt the phone mount down to keep it out of the way when I'm placing/ removing my sun shield in the dash. I like that the phone is not in the path of the air vent so it is less likely to overheat in the winter. I also like that there is a fold-down bottom bracket that provides extra stability while still allowing the phone to be plugged in. I have never used a car phone mount before but highly recommend this one.
5,Have had this in my Ford F-150 for almost a year now. 20000 miles 7 states (usually pulling an rv trailer so extra bouncing) and almost daily use. Works great for me. Never had to adjust or remount. Does not block the air vents and mounts high enough I can keep my eyes on the road and glance at the phone screen when needed. I use the CD mount since I have no CD’s and window mounts are illegal in my state.Great alternative to dash mounts which overheated my phone and vent mounts that blocked the AC.
5,Fits in CD holder so no suction used.The good: price: I paid $12 totally worth it!! Very easy to pop open to release phone. Has slot so can be charging while in the holder (important to me). The axis allows all angles of movement for it to be turned toward me ideally not just up/down and right/left.The bad: this is more of a caution than a truely "bad" issue. it feels cheap. It needs a gentle hand!!!! I've only had it one week so maybe its fine but im cautious with it. I make sure to use the release button to widen the grip rather than pull the phone out of its grip (which can be done but made me feel like it could break) i needed to create habit to use release button and not pull the phone out of its grip which is really doable.
4,Supports phone nicely but the opening for the lightning cable is a bit of a pain  I wish it was an open slot vs. a closed hole so you must connect the phone after you've placed it in the holder which is a bit of pain.  The twist to tighten cd slot explander works well.
5,I love the fact that this product utilizes a feature within my car that I won't ever use again the CD slot. The phone holder easily installs and is very sturdy. No matter which way I orient the phone while in the holder the phone does not slip around or fall out. Very happy with this purchase.
4,Covers the touch screen too much even when upside down on a 2019 Subaru Forester.
4,Fits in CD holder can be inverted as I have it in figure 2 (circled part) so rides "higher" if have a display screen that you don't want to block below.  In this position it rides higher than the MPOW one (that currently appears no longer available on Amazon) I am replacing; the MPOW when phone was vertical blocked a good portion of display even positioned "high" similar to this one.  This one won't (hopefully shown in photo #1) block much if any of my display.  (May appear to block to some of view out windshield in photo but in reality it doesn't.)  If want phone lower the circled area in figure 2 can be flipped downward by reversing how the clamp fits into the CD holder positioning the phone/holder lower all allowed by the 360-degree ball joint on the back.The unit I received was "stiff" -- when pushing the side bracket release button the "arms" moved outward slower than frozen molasses in Vermont in Jan.  A squirt of WD-40 into the separation mechanism voila problem solved I'm a happy camper.Only design flaw that I see is that bottom bracket of holder does not lock into place responds to gravity.  If that turns out to be an issue I'll either tape it or glue it in the "open" position.  As long as I keep this gizmo vertical don't think it will be an issue unless I keep "hitting" that piece when placing the phone on into the holder.  The side clamps would probably be enough to hold without the bottom bracket but I want the security of the bottom bracket too with a phone I don't want getting dropped during a critical portion of GPS-ing.
5,I've had two different kinds of holders for my phone--one was suction and the other was for the aircon vent.  Both didn't work well at all falling off over bumpy roads.  This one is the best.  It's really sturdy I can twist the phone whichever way I want and so far it hasn't fallen out of the CD mount nor has my phone fallen off it.  Also has a small slot for your charger to connect to the phone.  excellent product so far!
5,Easy to assemble. Holds my phone so that it doesn’t fall while driving or turning. Holder is very sturdy and cradles my iPhone 13 perfectly. One of the best purchases I’ve made.
4,This is an otherwise great product that suffers from two flaws. Firstly the securing screw is placed on the wrong side of the product. Because it is located opposite the direction of the phone clamp arm it's presence is unnecessarily prominent and blocks access to the dashboard behind it. This would not have been a problem if it was located on the same side as the phone clamp arm. The second flaw compounding the first is that the screw is too long and so protrudes an extra centimeter more than it needs to further blocking access to the dashboard behind it. I purchased a M6-1.0 x 12 mm cap head screw to replace the one included and it is significantly less obtrusive.
4,It’s pretty sturdy and easily installed. Although I wish the clamp sturdiness was better because my phone falls off quite easily.
4,Works with a Pixel 6 in an Audi
5,I bought one of these to try out in one of my cars and loved it!  It's very sturdy easy to install and keeps the phone steady while driving.  I loved it so much I bought one for all of our cars (ours and our kids).  Found out later it doesn't work in just one of our cars.... IT DOESN'T WORK IN OUR RAV4.  The CD player in our 2014 Rav4 is set a little more back from the dash and has a flimsy metal frame around it.  When I put this holder into the cd player and started screwing it down to secure it it bent out the top and bottom metal frame of the cd player.  Didn't have this problem in any other car or truck just the one so check how your cd player is made before you order.
5,I can't say much about this it's very basic. Installation was a little awkward getting the flaps to spread while holding it in place in the CD slot. I'm not the handiest nor do I have the best hand eye coordination skills but I got it installed in 6 minutes.  It came loose after 8 days and I tightened it up. Easy fix and it has hung in there ever since.
5,Was super easy to install and has lasted for over a year. Absolutely love it!
5,Solid unit keeps phone above stereo screen so I can still use rear camera holds phone very firmly unit comes with additional rubber pads for wider CD player gaps was too wide after adding for the slot on mine so removed them unit locks in very solid even without extra pads hasn’t moved since install even setting in hot car in full sunlight the bottom foot folds up and don’t have to use but has cutout for charge cord if you decide to
5,Use every day for work adjusts to many phones and holds up where many other products broke on me.
5,This makes "hands-free" so easy.  Slipped right into my CD spot that I don't even use and holds my phone perfectly.
5,This product arrived quickly and works as promised.  Very happy.
5,I purchased this because I thought it would be a robust sturdy mount unlike many others. Unfortunately it didn't fit well in either of my vehicles; it sat too low in one an interfered with the shifter and it sat too high in the other and blocked the entertainment systems touch screen. Fortunately it fit and works well in my spouses car and they were really struggling to find a decent mount that they liked. So YMMV with the fit and usefulness in your car but if it does fit well you'll like it.
