5,Great quality case and fits perfectly!
5,Great product  does everything I need and compact to fit easily on desk
1,It worked great for 2 week with my HP Elitebook 850 G8. I had 2 HDMI displays and 1 conference speaker connected in addition to the laptop. However it suddenly stopped working and I have returned it.
5,This works on an HP ProBook250 which does not have thunderbolt but does have USB-C. The laptop will not charge with this connected though. You have to plug in the charger AND the dock. Dual monitors works fine and the laptop lid can be closed.
1,I bought this dock brand new and it worked for the first few weeks then it died or so I thought. My computer was never the same after getting this maybe it couldn’t handle the two monitors that HP advertised that it could but then the usb-c port stopped charging entirely last night. Luckily my employer is going to swap out my computer and I “only” have to recreate 3 years worth of macros and some SQL queries.The IT Parts Store charged me a 15%/$29.55 restocking fee because their “engineer was personally using it throughout the day” and they can only sell this as used now. I assume they think I had buyer’s remorse and didn’t want it anymore which is humorous considering that was the cheapest addition to my current setup. Either way they tested it for a day and I made it long past a day before the dock burned me.The IT Parts Store is putting this back on the shelf and selling it as used so hopefully you’re not the poor sucker that gets this and it burns up your computer too.
5,I love this. I am able to use two monitors wireless mouse keyboard and charge my Bluetooth all at the same time.
5,Love! Love! Love!  Small one stop dock.
5,Plug and play.  Worked perfectly with my EliteBook.
5,It works.  Price and delivery quite satisfactory.
