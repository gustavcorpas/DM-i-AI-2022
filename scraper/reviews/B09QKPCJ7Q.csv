3,I believe that this cooling stand will work quite well for some and so I urge you to know what you are purchasing and read both specs and reviews to determine whether you fall into that category.  That being said I see both positives and negatives to this design and I'll give my impressions based on having tested several laptop coolers over the years.  To begin with I almost always use a cooling stand when doing any real work as I am running a high end graphics laptop that runs on the warmer side (with a high end graphics and two HDD's) and is housed in an aluminum case.Pros:The stand is relatively sturdy.  It is a mixture of some type of metal and plastic.  It is heavy enough not to feel cheap and light enough not to be off-putting.  The fans are fairly large and for the most part cover each of the corners to the middle of the stand giving it a large area of coverage (for fan effectiveness please continue reading below).The stand comes with a standalone braided usb cable (which should help with wear and tear) which gives plenty of reach from the back of the stand where the USB inputs are to any USB input on your laptop.  You will also find the fan controls on the back of the stand near the USB inputs.  There is cord management on the bottom center of the stand which is convenient as the USB used to power the stand is not connected permanently on one side and could get lost otherwise.There are two retractable kickstand-like feet on the bottom of the stand that are meant to keep the fans off whatever surface the stand is resting on.  This is a great feature as it increases air flow around the fans on the bottom of the stand which is especially important if you're using this for example on your bed on top of a comforter which would leave no space between the bottom of the stand and the material.  These "feet" are plastic and while they seem sturdy I wonder how well they would do with a larger and heavier laptop over the long run. There are also two feet on the top of the laptop (the side that the laptop sits on) which are smaller and also made of plastic.  There is no documentation with the stand to explain what these two smaller feet are for and I can only assume it's to counter the slant that is created by the feet on the bottom of the stand (basically it helps the laptop to sit more flat relative to the surface the cooling stand is on).  I've not seen this feature on any of the cooling stands I've used before and I think that it is a smart idea as I do not always want a significant slant when typing as it can cause discomfort in one's wrists (see more on this below).Finally the 12-month warranty the AMNIE offers is a very nice feature and I appreciate a company standing behind their products.  Could it be longer?  Any warranty could always be longer but I believe at this price point $25-$30 a one-year warranty is absolutely appropriate and one could even argue it's more than appropriate when many electronic components come with 90-day warranties.Cons:I found the dimensions of this product to be less than 16" x 11" (and the dimensions are actually listed as slightly bigger than that online).  I wish that I had taken a picture of this before returning the product but I was more concerned with getting a product that would work for my needs as soon as possible.  This was a significant issue for me as the description states that it supports a 17" laptop which I have (I actually pulled out a measuring tape and measured the length and width prior to ordering for this very reason).  Had the measurements been spot on it would have fit perfectly however it does not.  The irregular shape of the stand also adds to issue because a slight overhand is compounded in the areas where the shape angles in towards the center of the stand (in the middle of each side).With regards to the two retractable kickstand-like feet on the bottom of the stand as I mention above I wonder how well they would do with a larger and heavier laptop over time.  With regards to the two smaller feet on the top of the stand I quickly found a design fault.  Being that they are smooth plastic and most bottoms on laptop are metal or some other smooth surface there is absolutely no traction/friction and a laptop could easily side off of these feet if for example it was accidentally bumped or while you are moving the stand and laptop.  It would have been a simple addition to add a rubber-like pad or some other material/coating on the end of those feet which would create friction.  This is a real surprising oversight on the designer's part.  Unfortunately I did not take note of whether this issue exists on the bottom set of feet.  However I feel that this would be less of an issue due to the fact that the feet are larger and therefore have a larger surface area and also have the weight of the stand and the laptop bearing down on them which would impact their stability in this area.This is personal preference of course and I will explain why but I feel that the stand-alone USB power cable is less than ideal.  I truly disliked the fact that the cable used to power the stand a USB cable is not connected permanently to the cooling stand.  You might conclude that not being permanently connection makes it easier to pack up and store and not worry about damaging the connection but if it were permanently attached there is no need to have such a vulnerable connection.  The connection could be made internally and the only thing protruding would be a malleable cable with one usb connection.  This is a design choice of course but it could become problematic because it makes the cable easier to lose.  How many times have you lost or forgotten a cable?  But "what about the included cable management" you ask?  How many times have you packed up for the night and didn't put everything away because you were in a hurry or [insert any number of excuses here]. Sure you can replace this cable but it is one more expense and it would be a definite inconvenience.  Also again there is the increased chance of damaging the male and female USB components at the stand connection point where there is normally only one (if that cable was internally connected as it is on my current time tested laptop cooler).Finally perhaps most important (aside from the size issue because if it doesn't fit what's the point?) is the effectiveness of the fans.  As I mentioned previously I have a laptop that runs warm and sometimes downright hot.  If you have a laptop that runs warm-hot I do not believe this will work for you.  I found the fan output to be very week when leaving my hand next to them.  That being said it appeared to keep the surface of the stand (which I believe if I remember correctly was some sort of metal) a relatively neutral temperature.  So it's not entirely ineffective but I can say with certainty that it is not equipped to deal with a laptop that runs quite warm.  In case there are any naysayers who will try to make the argument that a laptop shouldn't run that warm/hot and that is a bigger issue that's really neither here nor there.  Some laptops run like that and have since the day they were first powered up.  As I said this cooler isn't ineffective it's just not going to be effective enough for certain laptops.  Also my GPU is located in the upper left corner of my laptop (under the Escape key essentially) and so I need more cooling in that area than anywhere else.  In fact the rest of my laptop is almost always room temperature.  So I was taking a leap of faith with this cooler stand hoping that the decent fan coverage in the corners would be enough to do the job...Unfortunately it wasn't.  Since the lighting that accompanies the fan operation is completely unnecessary I would only make sense to cut out the fancy unnecessary blue lighting and use the extra power to amp up the fan output.Conclusion:The AMNIE AE-CP1501 appears to be well built for its price.  If you have a laptop less than 16" you should be fine with regards to product dimensions and for the average laptop (not build for serious graphics work or gaming) it will likely do a decent job cooling your machine.  In that case I'd say that if you like the way this looks and the price is right give it a shot.  If you have a 17"+ laptop I believe that you'll find it runs a bit short which makes managing both the laptop and the cooling stand a bit much and as it is an irregular shape (not a rectangle but with several additional angles added in for show as opposed to increase air flow) it makes that even more cumbersome.  I ended up returning the product and ordering the newest version of the cooling stand I had purchased twice over the last 5 yearsÂ   Cooler Master NotePal U3 PLUS - Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad with 3 Moveable High Performance Fans (Black)        ).  The only reason I purchased something else (the AMNIE cooler) was because I was looking for an alternative that did not come with a fixed incline but I suppose I learned not to mess with what isn't broken as everything else on it perfectly for my needs and also came with an extended warranty.
4,The keyboard and mouse arrived in great condition. I work at a desk all day long with lots of OT so I needed something that could handle that. So far they keyboard is at 100%. Great battery life no issues with sticky keys or anything. However after about a month of using it the scroll wheel in the mouse came unattached so that doesn't work anymore. Unfortunately that is something I NEED to use throughout the day so it is big downside for me. It's past my replacement time frame so I use my cute keyboard and went back to my ugly wired mouse. For the price I'd expected the quality to last much longer than it did for the mouse. But honestly they keyboard on its own is great.
5,I saw this on someone else's desk at work and loved it's look.  It was hard to choose a color but I settled on blue. Everything seems to work well. It is different than a standard keyboard and I have a new desk. I gave ergonomics a 4 star because I am still trying to adjust to it but I that's the operator not the keyboard. The mouse is very comfortable in my hand. I may have to buy another one because I liked another color too!
5,Overall great purchase! Is pinker than expected and I wish the keyboard could be connected without the mouse but itâs not that big of a deal. No issues at all. Mouse sleep mode catches me off guard some times and key shape makes it easy to make typing mistakes but Iâm not the best at typing anyway lol
5,Iâve been looking for a typewriter style keyboard since they went viral around a year ago. I wanted the compact style because I have a smaller desk and didnât want to take up to much room. The only thing I had slight trouble with was that the description says itâs compatible with Mac OS so I assumed it was a USB-C cord because I saw no windows compatibility yet it came with a USB cord. Nonetheless it was nothing that couldnât be fixed with a simple USB to USB-C cord!For the product itself the sound it produces is SO pleasing. You either love it or hate it and I love it very much. I couldnât tell by the photos but you can change the lighting and one setting is specifically fixated on the WASD and Arrow buttons for gaming. Really appreciate that. Overall for the quality what I bought it for how easy it was to setup and how much it matches my aesthetic; I give it a 11/10. Definitely recommend this one!!
4,I enjoy the color and sound the buttons make while typing. Mouse is ok a little over sensitive. Will update in week or so and let you know how it holds up for a office worker who spends most of their days typing.
4,the only thing Im having trouble with is those 3 little white nobs on the top right of the keyboard. they are supposed to I guess light up to indicate if you have caps or number lock on but they don't light up at all and I can not for the life of me figure out how to make them work or if they're just broken
5,From the design to the color down to the sound of the keys when you click against them with your nails ð¤¤â¦I absolutely love everything about how this keyboard  set looks and feels! Definitely ASMR and ergonomically approved. Very easy to set up with its plug and play design. Already got compliments on how cool it looks and sounds from my cube-mates.
5,I love this keyboard and the sleek mouse. Durable well made. Going forward will get more from this company.
5,I got this keyboard and mouse for my at home office and it has been absolutely perfect! These paired really well together and connected to my computer. Itâs super easy to just plug them in and they automatically connect to work together. I personally love the foldable stands those are what I use the most but I love that there is also silicone nonslip grips on the bottom of the keyboard. I also really like that I can keep my area clean and how I like it. This is really easy to do it considering the Key caps are detachable so I can clean very easily. The size of this all is fantastic I love the way that the keycaps feel and the overall quality of everything is very good. Iâm really impressed with the price I paid for these it was a really reasonable price. Iâve gotten so many compliments on these from people that have been into my office. They complement the colors and how nice they look together. The mouse fits right into my hand perfectly and works really well it never lags. Overall Iâm really impressed with the quality of these and I just really love the way these look so much they really make me excited to do my work and type. I would highly recommend!
4,I brought this keyboard as a replacement of ny old one.  I am so glad I did.  Typing is super easy and smooth.  Easy to install too.
5,I ordered this for my home office and I love it! Works well is comfortable to use and is aesthetically pleasing!
5,I love it. The keyboard is very cute and I love the clicking noise!Idk if I like the mouse as the roller placement is a little weird and Iâm always a little off when I try to use it but besides that itâs perfect
5,Love it so cute for my office And very easy to set up.
5,Itâs a great keyboard and mouse it fits my office/game station great. So far I have had no issues. Great for the money plug and play.
4,They keyboard worked automatically when I plugged in the USB.  I cannot get the mouse to work for the life of me.  I've tried all the various ports on my desktop to no avail.  It's a shame because I wish I could use it.That said I have no complaints about the keyboard or the rest of the installation process.  I have a wired mouse so it's not a huge deal but I can't seem to resolve this issue.  The keyboard colors are also slightly pinker than displayed for the milk tea version but I still like it so it's fine -- I just expected a bit more brown.
4,I absolutely love/love/love this keyboard.  It's fun it's sassy and it feels really good when hitting the keys.  The mouse however is painful to use - it is too wide and shallow and my wrist literally hurt when using it.So 5 stars for the keyboard but just two stars for the mouse and I'll round that up to a 4 star review.
5,Parece de Juego.
3,This keyboard for starters is so cute and exactly what I was looking for design wise. The typewriter type keyboard is so satisfying and overall love the design. However after using this keyboard for a few weeks Iâve noticed that for the price it is quite glitchy especially noticeable when gaming. The keys will get stuck on screen even if Iâm not pressing the key anymore certain keys take multiple times to press to get them to work and the mouse can also be finicky about when it works too. Iâve tried changing the battery or changing the location of the Bluetooth receiver to no avail. The issues keep happening and unfortunately will have to purchase a new one :(
3,I purchased the keyboard because my current keyboard was malfunctioning due to dust and debris - the new keyboard is supposedly easier to clean. The initial order arrived without a box instructions mouse USB receiver and was covered in debris (animal or human hair). I notified the seller through Amazon and they sent a new order - much much better condition. The new one seems to function perfectly - so far.
4,Very cute! I love it
3,Keyboard is okay. Iâm picky about my click-feel and I like this one. You can tell itâs cheaply made but itâs cute. Just at the wrong height for wrists trying to find the right support-thingy thatâll help with that but Iâve literally never had this problem before. Mouse is insanely terrible and the 2 pieces work together due to the wireless setup.
5,It is so freaking pretty. I highly recommend if you are trying to add a little something cute to your office space!
3,I LIKE THE COLORS KEYS AND TYPING WAS EASY. BUT THE PRODUCT FEELS CHEAP THE MOUSE IS DEFINATELY FEELS AND LOOKS CHEAP. MINE WAS THE "UPGRADED VERSION" AND HAD TO RETURN IT AS THE MOUSE DID NOT WORK. THEY ARE SENDING ME A REPLACEMENT WE'LL SEE HOW THAT ONE WORKS.
5,Love this keyboard! Itâs cute and aesthetically pleasing. It connected right away and I have a MacBook. I want to buy it in other colors!
3,I returned this. It was WAY bigger than I expected
3,The keyboard is super cute and the buttons make a satisfying clicking noise. My only complaint is that some of the keys don't work half of the time and you have to hit it a few times in order for it to type. I love the back button on the mouse!
5,Wife loves it
3,Keyboard termination seems like a toy
5,It is amazing! The keys are not very loud the mouse and the keyboard connected immediately to the computer once I connected the usb. Remember both the mouse and the Kay board use AA batteries. Mouse uses 1 battery keyboard uses 1 battery. Overall and until now the product is amazing
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â This is a very unique keyboard! I got it for a friend who wanted something different from the normal black and silver and I think she was very happy.It works just like any keyboard - super simple to use.  Pretty much plug and play as the computer will recognize the device and should get it going quicklyThe keyboard has an old school feel to it with the key design but it works just like any modern keyboard and mouse.  Just really unique !
4,it doesnt make that clicky clack sound i wanted but so far it is really nice
4,The keyboard works great and looks so gorgeous. The mouse will take sometime getting used to. I do think itâs overpriced.
5,I purchased this keyboard mouse set for my daughter. She is a roblox video game player and recently started to design the game's 3d environment after replacing our old keyboard with this one she loved it and got even more motivated. Compared to old one this keyboard is quiter and more appealing for a nine years old girl. I liked the wireless combo design which kept the desk much cleaner. Oh also it took only couple of AA batteries to power it up. So far we are happy with the keyboard and mouse set.
5,I really like thus keyboard. It comes with a mouse and if you do not need to use it it goes on sleep mode just click the mouse and it will wake up. Quite easy to operate. Just plug it on your desktop and you are good to go. Would have been great if there's an instruction that goes with it but it is quite easy to put together. Color is also amazing. Oh would also be nice if they make an ergonomic design one. But this will do for now.
5,Me gusto mucho.
5,Installation was a snap.  Everything worked as described.  Newest feature for me was the backward button on the side of the mouse.  Pressing this returns the display to the previous screen.
2,UPDATE 10-28-2018: I was initially very pleased with this product.  However I've since learned that it's not very long lasting.  Over a year ago maybe even two one the fans started making this buzzing sound as though the fan blades were hitting something.  I could tap the cooler and make the noise go away for a while but it kept coming back until it wouldn't go away at all.  Eventually I just turned off that fan along with the other fan it was power-paired with.  Also the metal screen that the air blows through is attached by sliding what amounts to tenons through slots in the plastic and bending them over so they can't slide back out; so I can't even get in to the actual fan to try and clear whatever is stuck in there.This is not what prompted me to update my review though.  Several months ago the USB port I was using to power the cooler must have started coming loose because I was getting inconsistent fan speeds and in turn changing fan noises.  Personally I find it a little annoying to keep hearing a fan speed up and slow down; I would much rather have one constant speed/sound.  I switched to the other USB port and that seemed to solve the problem.  I was annoyed that one of the USB ports was faulty but since I never use the extra one I got over it.  But then that one started doing the same thing.  It got to the point where the fan was barely spinning at all.  Finally I wiggled the cord inside the port until I found where it was making the best connection and I slid the ends of a twist-tie into the gap in order to hold the cord in place.I guess I just don't understand how something as simple as a laptop cooler can fail so quickly.  My parents have appliances that they still use from the '60s some even older...  I have taken extremely good care of it.  The only times it has left my room is when I've had to move.  When I would move I would put it back into its original box to protect it during the trip.I haven't tried reaching out to the producer yet.  I don't know if I'm going to though because it only came with a 12-month warranty.  If I do I'll update my review further.I have been very pleased with this cooling pad so far.  Keep in mind I don't know what makes for a good cooling pad other than for it to keep your laptop cool so take my review for what it's worth.One of my biggest concerns when buying it was its shape/design.  The only reason I initially considered it was because of how well it was reviewed.  I worried that the shape would not be very functional or practical but so far it hasn't been an issue.The fans seem quite powerful yet very quiet.  I can easily fall asleep with them on at full speed (although I am the type of person that needs some type of noise in the background to fall asleep like a fan radio etc so maybe my opinion on that issue is biased).When I opened up the box and felt it it was extremely light.  I was worried that it might not be very durable but so far that hasn't been an issue and I hope it stays that way.The USB cord provided with the pad seems to be very high quality.  The braided cloth insulation is really nice and feels very durable.One of the recurring complaints I read about in the reviews before I purchased this was about the blue LEDs.  The fans have power dials but the LEDs are connected to the fans' power dials and don't have their own separate controls.  As a result if your fans are on your LEDs are on.  I personally have not found this to be very distracting.  On the contrary if I position my laptop properly the LEDs act as a soft night light when I turn off the lights in my room yet do not interfere with my view of my laptop display.  I do agree that the LEDs should have their own separate control though from a design perspective.  I would be so simple to do and would please a lot of people.  But I definitely don't think it's an issue worth worrying about.All in all I am very pleased with this cooling pad so far and I would definitely recommend it to others.
5,Typing is really smooth and it doesnât have that typical typewriter sound that most of the bluetooth keyboards have. Mouse has a different cursor speed setting and it has a very comfortable rubber grip. Looks cute and the product quality is great.
5,This case looks so nice. Both are connected to the the same USB nano receiver so the set up itâs an easy and quick process. Itâs a bit hard to use the mouse but I will get used to it soon. Itâs worth it tho.
5,They look very nice. I like the style. They are sharing the same USB nano receiver which makes things easier. Some people may think the keys are too small to use but I feel they are okay. Both of them are using AA batteries. However batteries are not included a little sad.
5,Super cute. I love the way the keys sound when typing. Very old school computer vibes. Beautiful color and comes with cool little keyboard brush.
5,What I like most about this keyboard is the ergonomic feel and that it goes on sleep mode on its own. Itâs a good value for the money
5,I love every single thing about it! The colors are perfect! Like a milk tea ð§
4,PROS:â¢Keys feel a little cheap but doable (similar to Surface Pro 6 but not as satisfying imo)â¢Keys are compact but big enough to pressâ¢Mouse is comfy for petite hands satisfying click lightweightâ¢Cute pastel pink color. None of that salmon/orange pink like other keyboardsCONS:â¢Would be more helpful if the "Fn" key had a lock on option like the "Caps Lock" keyâ¢Not the best for gaming with on hand. You need two hands to use the "Fn" keys which is tedious if you need to use the mouseMy opinion:Fell in love with the way it looked. Took some time to get used to the keyboard after using the Surface Pro 6 keyboard for over a year. The mouse is a step up from the Victsing mouse which finally bugged out after 5 years of use. This mouse is smooth and fast satisfying to click and easy to maneuver around.
2,Looks good but Iâve had this keyboard for 2 months and even with brand new batteries it is hit or miss if some of the keys work the first couple times you click them.  So if you donât do the 1 finger typing just be prepared.
3,It uses up battery while youâre not using it
5,Iâve had these for a good while at my work and I am very happy with it!! I get compliments on my keyboard often from coworkers that then try to buy one and itâs ânot as pretty!â Theyâve said!! I do keep batteries on hand so that I can replace them as needed since it tends to stop working mid sentence when the batteries run out!!! Easy to change them though! I would buy again if needed!
2,Keys stickâ¦. I bought this for my daughter for her new job. She asked me to return it because the keys stick and thatâs not helpful when youâre in the middle of a spreadsheet and the backspace sticks and cleans out a whole line of data you just put in.
5,I like that its light weight but good material the pink color is a soft pink not to bright. Good size keyboards it does not have a height adjuster so I had to buy a tilt riser to put on top and now its perfect i love it. I looked through so many keyboards the mouse is light weight too fits perfectly in my hand.
3,I type pretty fast (~90 wpm) and closeness of the keys on this keyboard was awful for me. I could barely type a sentence without a mistake because I hit multiple keys and if I did make it through a sentence it was because I had to slow down considerably which is not ideal. Plus the FN keys are so close to the numbers that I accidentally opened random things sooooooo many times and I'd have to stop and figure out what was going on. It's very light and a beautiful keyboard on the desk. Also the mouse is GREAT. It works smoothly but isn't overresponsive and has a satisfying click. These are the reasons I gave it three stars but I have to return and wanted to make sure people who type fast knew this might not be the perfect keyboard for them!
1,Once I plugged this device in I was unable to add them via Bluetooth to connect to my MacBook. So I restarted it. Then it wouldnât stop restarting making me sign in then restarting again and again. I googled this on my phone and apparently this happens with faulty peripheral devices. Not worth the hassle if you have a Mac
2,This set seemed fine (the plastic felt a bit cheap but for the money it was good enough) and I was using it for a full-time work from home job. After a few weeks off I went to log in and neither the keyboard nor the mouse was working. I changed both batteries with no success and can't find anything the might help me troubleshoot them.If you need a temporary solution this is an option but you may want to plan ahead.
5,Good ol wfh life has me redoing a desk space and this affordable but functional purchase was a good one. I like the way the keys type - they're easy. The mouse works like it should. And my cute desk space has a little vibe now haha. Only annoyance (if you can call it that) is that they keyboard takes a AAA battery and the mouse uses two AA's. Which isn't a big deal at all. Good bang for your buck if you ask me
5,Theyre good and cute for the office only thing you need batteries on hand. Ive had mine for a few months and the mouse goes thru batteries like crazy! Keyboard is still on battery #1. They are smaller than a regular set but still work great. Im in my offoce all day no issues at all
5,I love this mouse and keyboard!  Both are very comfortable to use:  the keyboard keys are soft which help if you type fast and the mouse is designed to fit your hand. Love the pink color!  The sleep mode doesn't bother me too much like some people said but it's probably a preference thing.  It would be nice if the keyboard had the little elevation feet like some keyboards do but it's not enough for me to downgrade my rating.
2,The only good thing about this is that its pretty. Sticky keys really terrible to type and mouse was a joke. Returning it
4,Make sure your connection is good on wireless.  It sometimes struggles.  But it is a lovely set.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â This is perfect I love it! I like how loud the keyboard is still need to get used to it but good for now
5,I was a bit skeptical about this keyboard/mouse combo from a brand I didnât know but it was totally worth the money. I got the pink one and it goes perfectly with my home office decorations. Itâs easy to connect with the usb that comes with it and itâs just so smooth. I definitely would recommend. Even my sister in law fell in love with it.
5,Eye catching functional and easy to use
3,I bought this keyboard because it was cute (what girls doesn't love pink?!) and because it was wireless. Setup was really easy. I did have to hunt for a couple of batteries but that's no big deal. The trouble came with actually using the keyboard. I thought I would hate the large keys but they are actually fine.My problem is with how loud the keyboard is. Each key makes noise when you press and release it. Also the keyboard itself is uneven so it makes even more noise. I ended up putting it on a hand towel to keep the uneven keyboard from tapping on my desk.Overall the keyboard itself works find. You just might have to modify your workspace to accommodate the noise.
3,First off the model I received was in a box that indicated 2 height adjustment however they must have redesigned the product because the smaller legs are no longer there. It appears to be there but it is just an outline of where they use to be. I had watched the you tube review before purchasing and was really excited about the product. But since the box advertising and amazon listing is wrong I feel this is false advertising on the part of the product box manufacturer and seller. The seller should know what he is selling. Whether or not it will actually keep my laptop cool will remain to be seen but I felt the lower rating was justified since I was mislead. This higher height is not really comfortable for me and if I close the back legs then there isn't enough room to provide the fans will ample draft. I just think the advertising for this product should be adjusted. Had I known I would have purchased a different product.
4,I love the vibrant pink color. The mouse and keyboard are 2 different pinks but i donât mind! I do Mind the battery component or the 2 different battery size components. Wish it was rechargeable for the price.
5,I've had this keyboard for almost three years now it works great for the price. Battery life is also decent. It is used pretty regularly and I even was coding for hours at a time at one point. I've replaced the mouse battery once and the keyboard battery twice.
3,Would of been awesome if after twice I would have gotten all the parts but didn't. Never sent the technology for the mouse. I never received the piece that plugged in for the mouse to work. It's nice. Not cheap so I don't know if it would of worked or not
5,My HP pavilion laptops internal cooling fan stopped working and the computer would over heat and shut down almost immediately I bought this as a hope to cool it down to be able to do back up and transfer before attempting to replace the internal fan... It has worked so well iv just continued to use it with my broken fan. The air being forced out of the broken fans port is cool to the torch just be using this cooler alone!It's pretty quiet at full speed bought this over 3 months ago tons of hours on it does a great job cooling!Very impressed and happy with this buy
5,I really like this set. I use it with my work laptop and even my work computers. I love that the usb piece plugs into the mouse and is easy to get in and out. I just wish the mouse and keyboard had an on/off switch. I know that they go into sleep mode but if you hit a key it turns it back on. I travel to/from different offices and the keys tend to get bumped and I feel it will kill the batteries faster. otherwise it is great and I love it!
3,Honestly the keyboard is too cute. I love it really do but the mouse just isn't for me. Additionally I really like the way the MacBook has different F5 or F whatever but these unfortunately don't add up. that isn't what really bothers me though its the keyboard its not smooth and it lags quite a bit. might be returning.
3,So far my only complaint is the mouse.. the mouse either loses signal or dies every 10 minutes or so and the only way to wake it up is to bop it with my palm.. the keyboard is great so far. I kinda wish the keys were seperated just a bit.. but it's very close to my old keyboard which is what I wanted. I just wish the mouse worked.
4,Battery running out fast but works alright
2,I really loved this keyboard and mouse I've had it for little over a year but now it doesn't work.Last night it started with the backspace.. I pressed it and it put a \ instead of...backspace-ing. Then I tried other keys "a" is Tab "s" is caps lock and many other keys that don't work as they should. I'm really sad because I loved it AND now I have to find a new keyboard.On the other handBattery life is good I've only had to replace the batteries a couple times.It's normally responsive and easy to use.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â Ordered a pink one to replace an apple broken keyboard. It's very easy to connect with my laptop. Overall excellent value for this price. It's also very nice and compact easy to use. It has smooth keys compact size. I used it for a week and it shows awesome battery life so far. It's also stylish for designers or pink color decorating study room lovers. Worth to buy if you have a limited budget for a pair of keyboard and mouse.
2,I would give this item a better rating if I didnt have to spend an extra $20 on aaa batteries and aa batteries. Over all the keyboard was lopsided so i had to carefully bend the board to make it where it wont move everytime i use the keyboard. Hopefully i didnt break it. so all is well right now. and mouse are very nice and lightweight which i really like a lot although the click from the mouse is very loud and im not used to that. but i can get used to it.so Im giving this item a 1 star because of the battery issue and the keyboard being lopsided because for the amount of money i spent on this item and the batteries alone i couldve purchased something even more nicer than this but it is what it is.
5,This product arrives fast and was exactly what our daughter needed for school. It looks rxactly like thr pictures show and works excellent!
1,Mouse just stopped working I have changed the batteries and it just doesnât work anymore. This is a cheap-low quality product.
4,it's really good besides the fact the mouse freezes up and turns off sometimes when I'm gaming. If you intend to game a lot do not buy this mouse save up for a higher quality one
5,I bought these to use in my office at work and they are great! They make the space feel more like it's "mine". Even on tough days I can smile because of my happy little keyboard and mouse
3,The product itself LOOKS exactly as described. Keyboard felt sturdy but the mouse felt like cheap plastic. I was disappointed with the fact that you couldnât use the wireless keyboard without using the wireless mouse. I currently have a wireless mouse that I love and I was just looking for a cute keyboard.
5,It was so easy to install. It literally took me 1 minute to do. 10/10 would recommend.
5,Buy it without hesitation! Trust a picky buyerâ¼ï¸â¼ï¸
5,Really great keyboard. I love the pink colorant types great
5,I love the look of this cooling pad! I can definitely believe this is the "Best 4 Fans Laptop Cooling Pad" after using it. It keeps my laptop cool and is very quiet. My only problem with it would be hat when it is plugged in there must be at least two fans on. But this surely isn't a make or brake deal or even worth removing a star. And unlike some other reviewers I wasn't given this product for free.
5,Great purchase! I'm very happy with the functionality of both the mouse and keyboard.
4,I don't know if its wrong in the product or it takes the battery life quickly  but it keep stucks
4,The product was received quickly and in great shape. It was easy to install and easy to use. I would purchase again.
1,Does not work everyday. Iâve had IT troubleshoot & battery changes itâs defective doesnât work
5,I got it for work and I really love I got it for my birthday in September and only had to replace the once (I used the cheap batteries).
2,it was great while it worked.  Now the mouse stops working and i have to reboot the pc to get the mouse to start.  it's happened 3 times.  This last time i had to reboot the pc 3 times before the mouse would start working again.  But apparently the manufacturer does not warrant their item for more than 30 days.
5,I love this keyboard and mouse. I use it everyday at work. I was a bit skeptical but it's great no problems at all.
1,the USB port broke after a week (didn't get around to reviewing or returning due to time restraints). so disappointed the mouse was decent but the keyboard was so fun to use such a cute color relatively quiet great feel but the usb the thing that makes everything work broke while INSIDE my computers usb port. took an hour to fish out the metal surrounding from my usb port and was scared i was gonna get shocked when i had to resort to tweezers. SO so dissapointing i really enjoyed the feel of the product. maybe it was faulty but really just overall sad.
3,This item doesn't have the lifts in the back that allow for better ergonomics. I love the color though ð
5,Perfect combination works exceptionally well and looks really good !!!
5,The only complaint I have is that you need to wake up the mouse if it has been left still for a bit of time by pressing the middle button.
5,Fantastic cooler for a gaming laptop. Keeps the rig cool - the four fans spread out and disperse the heat. Even tilted up the surface is rough enough the computer doesn't slide off. Overall this is one of the better cooling pads I've used and it's well worth the money for it.
5,Battery life lasts because it turns off on its own when not in use. You can feel each key when pressed. Lightweight and definitely great quality and affordable
5,Doesn't cool my laptop as much as I would of liked it to but its pretty good. I love the extra port and the USB that comes with it.Update: It has been 5 years going on 6 and this thing stays on all day everyday and still going strong exception to one of the lights dying after all these years.
4,I am just starting out playing with mechanical keyboards so I'll try to provide enough information for people who know more than me to understand what I found and make your own decisions.  I wanted the retro look of round key caps for one of my full keyboard builds and I really liked the calm and neutral look of these key caps.  The caps did not disappoint for the most part -- out of the box they look just like the pictures and are quite pleasing.  The color and printing is good quality.  The cap tops are slick -- no texture here.  This is not my preferred feel but I guess some like it as so many caps are slick nowadays.  My only issues with the cap set themselves are there are no extras so you are stuck with the somewhat random color arrangement they have picked.  Given so many people are customizing today I wish more vendors would provide some extra caps and/or a set of num-keys even if the keyboard doesn't have them.The key switches are clicky blue.  The pressure required is what I'd call 'average'.  I have blue switches that take very little pressure (rated 45g) and these take noticeably more pressure over those.  I couldn't find a rating but they feel like my 60g rated blue switches.  This is not an issue at all just a comparison.  The one difference with this keyboard is the switches are inset into the base and the key caps have a stem that sticks out below the cap.  I'm not sure if it is this arrangement or something about the switches themselves but the action sound of these keys is a bit muted compared to my other blue switch keyboards.  They are just as clicky but the bottoming of the key makes more of a thump which makes the keyboard a bit quieter to use than all my other blue switch boards.This arrangement is also my one disappointment with the key board and caps.  My other key caps - that don't have the protruding stem -- can't fit on this board as their connector is recessed and can't engage the blue 'plus' connector.  Similarly these key caps don't work on my other blue switches because of something very subtle in the connector shape.  They just sit loosely on top of the blue connector and no amount of pressure causes them to engage and hold.  One final config note:  the keyboard has no built-in feet for angle adjustment.  Instead they provide 2 stick-on rubber feet if you want to raise the angle.So if you are buying this mechanical keyboard for looks and to use as is its a really nice board that delivers on the promises in the listing.  I quite like it.  But if you are buying it for the cap set and to customize be careful you know what you're doing because I wasn't able to share components across boards.
3,mouse freezes often
5,this keyboard is nice and lightweight. I've used it for several months and have only changed the battery once. Mouse is very light weight too. And i get so many compliments on the color!
1,Mouse worked super well!  Unfortunately the keyboard did not :( I returned it for a full refund but it is still a bummer about it not working. I think it may have been due to the fact it is shipped in the keyboard box like the packaging box with a shipping label slapped on it. Since the keyboard has no other packaging inside it probably just got damaged or bumped one too many times on the journey over to work well.Any way I hope ppl have better luck with this product than I did I would have honestly kept the mouse since it is such a cute color but I had to return the whole thing to get a refund on the keyboard.
5,PC love the color and just love the look.
2,It feels cheap but I didnt mind. I liked the color and the mouse. However it's only been less than 2 months and it's already malfunctioning. It started yesterday where I use a key but it types a completely different one than pressed. Didn't last long! Not worth the price.
5,Got this for my daughter gotta say very good quality and easy setup with good battery life.
5,Just received my keyboard today so far so good. Very smooth & easy to use. Came in the right color (pink) and is just as pictured. I love the mouse too!
5,Love the keyboard and love how quickly I received the product!
5,I love this key board! Itâs pretty light easy to use and compact.
5,Love love love it
2,So it can my laptop cool in cool environments.. I have owned this for some time and wanted to wait to write a review. Now don't get me wrong it can work but it is not as quite as you think it is after about a month it gets louder... If your house is at the temp of 79.... and your laptop has a history of over heating at 79 it will over heat.... With the fans on... I am kinda disappointed as i thought this was a good product to buy... I still will support this company as it works kinda and its what i can afford...
1,Review update:So from my last review I still think the keyboard is beautiful however the keyboard stopped functioning. I tried putting in new batteries but the only thing that is working is the mouse. I highly recommend buying the warranty (which is probably why they offer it) because the keyboard stops functioning after a few months. Sucks because I loved my keyboard now I have to throw it away ð.1st ReviewThis keyboard is awesome! Very beautiful and very comfortable to use. It sparks up my workspace! I love that you can actually feel the buttons press down and the keys are not flat. Overall I love the keyboard! Itâs comfortable has beautiful presentation and is convenient as it is wireless.
3,Not very durable
5,I have enjoyed this so far. The keys are sensitive to touch. Love the color. Everything works well and it is as I expected.
5,I always have people coming to my desk saying how much they love my keyboard and mouse. Itâs so cute I love it.
4,While looking to replace the wired keyboard and mouse of our main HTPC I came across this set and couldn't resist grabbing one! The aesthetic of the green and blue reminds my of frogs on lily pads as does the round keys and oblong flattened mouse.Form is great with the retro typewriter keys randomized color way and semi ergonomic staying but function is great as well: no issues connecting either keyboard or mouse to the 2.4 ghz dongle and the sleep function is a great battery saver.I've had wireless sets before but they usually feel a bit fragile and you could run out of battery suddenly interrupting whatever you're working on. This set feels more substantial equal to most wired keyboards and has an indicator light for low battery that helps keep surprise battery death at bay (at least for the keyboard half). The mouse is larger than most but feels good in my larger bands as well as my wife's smaller ones ; it also easily reads the few surfaces we've used it on.Although I'm not a fan of rubber dome style keys the other major selling point here is the ease of cleaning: I've never had a keyboard -or typewriter- that was easier to get crumbs dust and debris out of. The included brush was cute but not really necessary for the most part as clearance under the caps is awesome enough that compressed air or a mini vac could easily clear it out.This set adds a great pop of color and frees you from the clutter of wires - not to mention opening up a USB port; I'd recommend it for the price if you're in the market for an eye catching wireless set for sure!
5,I have an Alienware R17 fits the cooler nice and does its job well even when the fans are not running. Just had to explain to TSA what this was the last time I flew  Would recommend as a cheep way to keep laptops cool.
2,mouse was fine...not the keyboard
2,The keyboard is amazing love the buttons and all. The mouse does not work I was a little disappointed in that. I really need all complete wireless material to work when I work. Unfortunately I have to give my rating a 2 because the keyboard is the only thing that works
5,I love the keyboard and mouse. Easy to set up and I have received compliments at work! FYI this keyboard sits flat.
4,I am not sure if this would be a good keyboard for gaming. I would recommend this for personal use or school. The typewriter keyboards make it easy to type. I did notice after a while that the key for the letter "P" is missing. I can still type the letter "P" but the key says it's something else (see pics). I had to adjust to the mouse because I am not used to having a mouse that wide. I have gotten used to it now but I do warn that the side button does the mouse acts like a "go back" on my laptop. Just test it out before you go onto any important websites and you accidentally press the side button and all your hard work you entered is gone. The only other pet peeve I have is that the space bar also does not sound the same as the keys. The keys when typing sounds soft and the space bar has a broken and louder sound.  The keyboard does come with a brush to clean in between the keys.
5,Perfect!
5,The keyboard is very beautify and quality is good!!! This is the gift for my friend. She loves it very much!!!
4,Cool quite don't really understand the blue lighting but I really like the four separate fans that seem to cover the entire laptop.
1,You need two different battery AA and AAA. There's no elevation for your wrist. Home key does not work at all.  Cheaply made possible.  Feels like child's toy.  Waste of time ...Oh and there's no power on and off button on any.
5,Great product one USB controls the mouse and keyboard makes it less confusing and convenient.
1,I was very excited when the keyboard first arrived. The colors were cute and the buttons were smooth. It always missed a few keys while I typed but I didn't think much of it and thought it was a normal delay since it is a Bluetooth keyboard.But 5 months in the keyboard has stopped working entirely. The mouse still works but it was the keyboard I really needed.This is really disappointing.
5,Simple easy to set up no complications.
2,Itâs ok. The mouse loses itâs connectivity and you have to click on it. Itâs also not very receptive. The keyboard is fine.
5,Todo sÃºper funcional y elegante para mi oficina
5,Love it for use at work!
4,I like this keyboard a lot. It adds a flair to my work station I didnât know I *needed*.Although the keyboard doesnât lack in aesthetics- with the backlit keys and retro look there are a few misses Iâd like to mention that wouldnât allow me to give it five stars.The keyboard has deep set keys and I like my nails long. It makes it a bit difficult to type like normal.The light will not turn off (or I havenât figured it out yet) unless my computer is completely shut down.The keyboard does not have a number pad attached. It still has the numbers at the top but I am more used to having the number pad.Lastly the keyboard doesnât have a stand for propping it up on a tilt so less ergonomic than other keyboards on the market. I ended up buying a stand separately.Overall 4 stars for the super adorable keyboard that adds a nice touch to my workspace!
5,Great fan i am using it for my 2015 Alienware 15 with a 980m. Keeps it cool and it is SUPER quiet but effective. would recommend over any other if you want something that looks cool is light quiet and keeps everything cold.
4,When my old keyboard and mouse died on me I knew I wanted something with a bit more feedback and decided to give this one a go.What I like about itI really like the colorway it's super fun and goes well in my office.I also really like the feedback on this keyboard it's very tactile and makes a satisfying typing noise.Only having one usb dongle to deal with is great since the ports on my computer are limited.I was surprised by how much I like the mouse. I don't normally use a wide mouse but I actually love it and probably won't go back to smaller mice anytime soon.It's plug and play so very convenient since there's no setup required.What I think could be improvedWhile I like the keyboard and the height of the keys I don't know how long the letters on the keys will last. They seem to be some sort of sticker or low quality print on. It's a bit frustrating because the print of the company name on the space bar is really nicely done so why they didn't do that with the rest I don't know. I've added a photo on my review of a close up on the keys and you can see that they're shiny stickers of some sort.I'm not a huge fan of the clicking noise the mouse makes but that's more a personal preference than anything else.Other than those two notes I do really like this combo. I think it's a good deal for the price and it's a fun way to customize your workspace.
4,As I've said before in my reviews...I LOVE boba milk tea and if there's anything that looks like boba milk tea I'd probably have to buy it. Case in point - this milk tea colored keyboard and mouse set. Happy with this purchase!I don't often see keyboards with brown color schemes so this was a unique find for me. Sure there's your standard black then there's white and silver and then you get into the greens and purples and blues but you don't often see brown. As a boba milk tea and coffee lover this color scheme fits me well.The round typewriter-like keys are a welcome addition to my ever-growing keyboard collection. I tried another round key keyboard several months ago but it was defective so I didn't keep it. Luckily this keyboard seems to be working well and I'm actually using it to type this review. It seems the round key keyboards are easier for my fingers to type on than the standard square key keyboards. Perhaps it has to do with key travel/spacing? Idk.The mouse is just fine but I don't use it. It has quite a loud click and I prefer the dpi settings of my Redragon Perdition. I think I'd use this milk tea mouse as a backup or something but not my daily driver. The mouse works fine and all just not the type I'd prefer to use. I will say the little scroll ball on the milk tea mouse is a pleasant surprise because normally I'd find a scroll wheel instead of a scroll ball. I feel like they designed it this way to fit into the boba milk tea scheme which is a nice design touch.I use this keyboard for office type stuff and not for gaming (which I do a lot of). I don't think I'd use this for any serious games but casual and relaxed games I think this would do just fine. There doesn't seem to be any noticeable lag when typing and all the keys work while doing my office type work. Oh and the keys aren't super loud which is nice in case you use this around other people who don't like loud typing. It's not a quiet keyboard like a laptop but it's a softer key sound compared to my gaming keyboards with red/brown/blue switches.Overall satisfied with this purchase and would buy again!
5,Got the for my wife's work computer. Works great and she loves the style and color.
1,I have constant issues getting both keyboard and mouse to work. Mouse doesnât track when I move it and the keyboard randomly stops registering what Iâm typing. Itâs infuriating. I replaced the batteries hoping it was just low battery and continue to have the same issue. Do not buy!
5,When I saw the style and color of this I knew I had to have it! Pllluuss my previous keyboard was destroyed by an unfortunate spill. I loved the vintage style keys and key lime color and I loved it even more in person. This may be my favorite keyboard I have ever owned and there are plenty of color options to match your personal taste.It was super easy to install super easy to use and I love that it's a full keyboard without taking up and obnoxious amount of space. ITS super lightweight so if you needed to travel with it that would also be easily accomplished.They are wireless but thus far I haven't had any issues or even had to charge anything we have been chugging right along!They do turn themselves off or go into sleep mode after not using them for a while and I really appreciate that feature. As soon as you click or press a key they come right back on! As far as electronics and keyboards are concerned the price point is very fair and you will love the look and feel of this! I love how much a simple change made my desk feel so much more like it was my space! And I love the feel of this mouse and keyboard when gaming or working at the computer!If this is your style I highly recommend just going for it! You will love the way your space looks!
5,Love my keyboard so easy and comfortable to use!
4,I am in love with the color palette of this keyboard! All the colors fit so well together. I love that itâs like typing on a type writer with the sound and the circle keycaps but it does take a little bit of time to get use to coming from a typical keyboard to this type. Itâs very easy to change the different lighting modes also. Itâs also nice that the wiring for the keyboard matches the color of it. Everything flows well together. The only complaint I have is for the cost of the keyboard I wish there was more than one color backlight choice. Other than that I totally recommend this keyboard!
4,I like this keyboard allot.  It's really fun and cute.  I've been typing for over 20 years and I've used allot of keyboards in that time.  It's definitely different and does take a minute to get used to but the keys are easy to use and not difficult to push down.  I don't think I would use this keyboard for work because I wouldn't type quite as fast using this one but for an everyday home office computer it's just fine which is what I wanted it for.  This is more of a decorative and fun type keyboard.  Maybe if you had very young and nimble hands you could be fast on this.  I could see my teenage self flying over the keys.  And actually the more I use it the faster I get (using it right now!).  The "fun-ness" of the keyboard outweighs any other concerns for me.  The only thing I don't love is the mouse.  It works and it matches the keyboard but it's a little ergonomically challenged if you use the scroll wheel allot as I do.  I like to be able to have my whole hand on the mouse and use the tip of my middle finger on the scroll wheel however on this mouse the scroll wheel is a little bit too far back for that.  Overall a very cute keyboard and mouse set and I'm happy it's sitting on my desk looking all adorable.  I would recommend this for home office use however I do think I'll be picking up a different mouse to use with it.
5,I love this - it provides cooling as described for my laptop and came with a sturdy USB cord that does not get in the way of working - great product - great seller - thanks!
5,Amazing for the price
2,This unit cools just fine but the plastic tabs that keep the laptop in place are extremely weak I use a separate keyboard and mouse and the plastic tabs look like they're about to break at any second. This does the bare minimum but it is not a durable unit I only recommend this for people that plan on having a stationary laptop which in my opinion defeats the purpose.
4,This keyboard is really neat. It is definitely mechanical so typing with it is super satisfying. Set up is also super simple you simply plug the usb (located on the bottom of the mouse) into your computer and it will pair the keyboard and mouse.Do note the batteries are not provided. The only reason I gave this product 4/5 stars is because I ordered the milk tea color and I received a bubble gum pink keyboard. Other than that I really like this keyboard and mouse combo.
1,Even though I received my order today I am very disappointed and frustrated.Just I rated only one star out of five because there was no batteries in the box unlike both the item description and its manual mentioned.I of course know batteries are not expensive. However everyone would be almost bound to be infuriated when the state of their purchase is different from the description.If not for that problem I would have thought I bought it at a good price.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â This keyboard is really beautiful in design especially for children.However during use the keys did not bounce back as smoothly as expected.In addition the mouse does not have DPI buttons so this keyboard and mouse kit is not suitable for playing games.It should be a good choice for children At least my kids love this keyboard.
5,Great product; great price; lots of compliments at work
2,This is overall a nice keyboard but it doesn't have a kickstand to allow your keyboard to have the ergonomically correct angle. If you don't mind typing on a flat sitting keyboard then it's a GREAT keyboard with an awesome color :)
4,it's very good
5,I luv my wireless keyboard / mouse thank you â¦.
1,Do not waste your money! The batteries haf to be changed every day. After 2 days the keyboard stopped working completely! The mouse never worked it was way off like you would go to click on something but the mouse would be pointing way off. Very cheaply made. Total thumbs down!
5,Love this at work!
5,First off I want to say in this review that I gave for gaming five stars but I don't game. I just figured it was such a nice keyboard that it would be good for gaming to. I like the buttons and how it works great .
4,Iâm not sure why people think they need to reinvent the mouse but the shape of this mouse is just silly. I tossed it.I used the keyboard for several weeks. While thereâs nothing wrong with it it wasnât my cup of tea. I felt like the distance I had to push the keys down was slowing down my typing. I wasnât a big fan of the feel either but Iâm sure thatâs just preference.I ended up opting for a keyboard that is extremely low profile and requires minimal effort to push the keys and minimal distance to push them as well.Again this is all just preference.Itâs a decent keyboard and I like the color scheme.
5,The design is BEAUTIFUL.No noise!Size is perfectCooling is really goodand price is AMAZINGLove how it has legs since I use my laptop on my bed :D
1,This product was faulty and didn't work as soon as I plugged it in. The mouse wouldn't connect and the keyboard wouldn't type even though there were lights flashing on both saying I had power. I had a friend that purchased one of these as well and it lasted maybe three months before dying and now she has to replace it.
5,There are two kinds of keyboards in this listing full-sized (without backlights I think) and a smaller keyboard that lacks a dedicated number pad but has amazing back lights. This review is for the latter.First thing I noticed was the beatiful dancing pattern of the lights as soon as I plugged it in. It made me feel a "wow! that's so cool" feeling.The keys are kind of loud so this is definitely not something you want to use in an open-office or in your bedroom office while your partner is sleeping. But I like the tactile feedback of the keys. Reminds me of a typewriter in a good way. It takes a little getting used to if you are used to using a laptop keyboard.If you get this you main things you need to know from the instruciton manual are:1. fn + Print Scr: will toggle between different modes of dancing lights including turning all the lights on. There are 20 modes and they are fun to play with especially consdiring that both the brightness and speed of the back-light annimations are configurable.2. fn + roman numeral keys: will light up just certain keys that are common for gaming (use fn + Print Scr to return to a normal lighting mode)3. you can create your own custom light up mode for exaclty the keys you want to have lit - which is very cool for gaming but not applicable for normal computer work.4. fn + up and down arrows: inceases and decreases brightness5. fn + right and left arrows: increases and decreases speed of lighting animation (for the patterns that dance). These are mostly a novelty but oh what fun!
5,Everyone who sees it always asks where did you get that. Even students love it.
4,This keyboard is larger than other "compact" keyboards that I have used. This one is about 14 inches x 5.5 inches in size. The last one that I owned was 11.5 x 4 inches. A keyboard with a full-sized number pad will be about 17 inches wide so this one is half-way in between. Compared to my other compact keyboard this one adds a dedicated row of function keys at the top (which I don't need) and a couple of extra columns of keys on the right for cursor navigation (which I really do like).The color of this keyboard is advertised as "milk tea". To my eyes the color is somewhere between tan and pink. If someone who sees this keyboard calls it pink I can't really disagree with them. On the other hand maybe it is enough "not pink" to appeal to boys as well.The backlight is white only not RGB like most other mechanical gaming keyboards. There are lots of flashing lighting modes but to me most of them are pretty obnoxious flashing patterns.Installation was plug-and-play with my Windows 11 PC. It uses the basic USB system driver. There is no app or driver to customize the keyboard. All customization is done with function keys and get lost if you power-off your PC or unplug the keyboard.The round keys are a little smaller than the square keys on most keyboards so I do have to be more careful when touch typing. The keys are slightly concave to make them easier to find by touch. Keypress feel is comparable to other mechanical keyboards in this price range. The clicky sound is a little more plasticky than other mechanical keyboards which can be annoying at first but I hope I get used to it.Overall if you're looking for a cute color cute shape mechanical-feel keyboard and you don't do a lot of customization then this one is a fine value for the current price of $36.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Â This is the most beautiful wireless keyboard & mouse set that Iâve ever seen in my life! Aesthetically Iâd give this product 10 stars and the nostalgic feel is something that MANY will appreciate. I also like the fact that it has a sleep mode and that both pieces are wireless which is essential for me. The price is completely on point for this making this set a great overall value.I find that the keys are easy to push. No issues there but I do have one issue and itâs a big one unfortunately. For ME and other very fast typers out there this may not work best for you (us). Why? As you can see in my added video clip if you type slowly like a typewriter this may not be of any issue but with fast typing itâs easier then a traditional keyboard to press the key that you want AND an additional incorrect key that you do not wanna push making getting tasks done potentially much harder using this keyboard. This only affects certain people but for me itâs a bigger problem then it will be for many others as I type mega fast. Bummer :(.Also Iâve become accustomed to using a small hand-shaped mouse and this has a much wider feel to me making it harder to use. Now had I not gotten used to a particular type of mouse Iâm sure this would be less of an issue but it does seem wide so small hands might not navigate very well using this. But it matches itâs wireless itâs seemingly well made and again like the keyboard itâs not going to be an issue for everybody.That being said in a whole it might not be a set that is best suited for me but I must be fair to the product itself so Iâve decided on a 3.75 star rating overall. I didnât feel comfortable going with 3 stars as my problems wonât be other peopleâs problems and will be a totally adored asset to many. (The retro push buttons.) Plus itâs gorgeous plus itâs nostalgic plus the buttons are easy to press plus the quality is great plus it has some great features including being totally wireless and including the mouse for a very fair cost. So itâs a great value and unless you try it youâll never know if itâs up your alley. Not completely anyways.Watch my video & decide for yourself but I felt it best to give this set an above average rating in all. It has a lot of pros going for it. It comes with a keyboard brush too! OH and itâs a perk for sure that the keys are removable for easy cleaning. Iâm still scared to try and remove them lol as it seems so wrong ha ha but it IS a perk!3.75 stars!â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸+ 3/4*I hope my review has proven helpful ð!*
4,Honestly I do like it and love the color scheme. I will say over the years Iâve gotten used to low profile keyboards and Iâm still adjusting to this one. However I do like the clickety clacking of the keys and wanted to switch up my keyboard so I am enjoying it so far.One thing I didnât think of before ordering is that there is no backlight to the keyboard. I regularly type in dark settings so this has been a major drawback for me and something to keep in mind if youâre a night owl like me.Once plugging into the USB port the responsiveness was fine I didnât notice any lag or skipping. Sleep mode seems to be great for both the lose and keyboard and they both wake up as soon as you begin typing or moving the cursor.Also be advised you will need 2 AA batteries just in case you didnât know/read the product description thoroughly like me.Overall I am having fun with it and as a writer it has helped draw me back to my desk to continue writer just for the satisfying clickety clack.
4,This keyboard and mouse combo is very unique. I love the pink color scheme. It is not obnoxiously loud in color and the gradient is pleasant. I must say that the keyboard is more pink than what is shown in the images and actually looks better in my opinion than what is pictured. The keyboard has a pleasant angle to it for improved ergonomics and you can also adjust the tilt with the two flip out legs on the bottom of the keyboard. One neat thing about this combo is that it only uses two AA batteries for the whole set. One is for the keyboard and one is for the mouse. There is no on or off switch for the keyboard and mouse. You just put the batteries in and then just press a button on the mouse and keyboard and it will automatically power on and start working. The receiver for the set stows away neatly in the bottom of the mouse. This keyboard and mouse combo are plug and play so no additional drivers are needed. All of the special functions are built-in to the keyboard. The neat thing about this combo is that you don't have to power it off...if no keys are pressed in a minute it goes into standby mode automatically and saves power. The keyboard is very pleasant to type on. The mouse is a weird shape and will take a while to get used to. There is a button on the side of the mouse that I thought was a forward/backward rocker but on my computer it seems to just be a back button. I do think this keyboard is a little on the pricey side for what you get but it is a good set and will compliment a stylish setup nicely.
5,Super cute and really easy to work with. It is really easy to clean.
2,I was very pleased with the item until the number keys on the side stopped working & the Numbers Lock key light keeps flickering.
5,This is probably my third typewriter keyboard (all different brands but similar styles). I love the colors of the green and blue on this keyboard. The mouse is my favorite design. I have one previously like it and I like how it fits around my hand. It's easy to use and connect to any computer or laptop.I have this keyboard for my office at work and I connect it to an HP desktop computer with no problems. It didn't come with any batteries but I had some on hand. You need 1 AA battery for both the mouse and the keyboard.The keyboard is not as loud as you would think typing on it. Or maybe I'm used to the noise. I enjoy the bigger buttons and it makes it easier for me to type.There was a weird metal wire under my right shift key which made a different sound than the other buttons. It was an easy fix. I just popped up the shift button and removed the metal. Now it sounds like the other ones.Overall I'm pleased with this keyboard and mouse.
5,Love love love this!!!
1,The keyboard has no on/off switch. It goes through its battery in 5 days. Not worth it.
5,I bought this fan for my ps4 and it keeps it nice and cool! The blue lights adds a nicel look to it
5,I love that is easy to clean and I love the look too.This works great with the iPad Pro 11 which I am very happy.
5,Although this was not purchased for gaming purposes I have really been enjoying this keyboard. Keep in mind though this does require batteries and they are not included. It comes with the keyboard mouse and a key cleaner which will come in handy. The keys are very asmr and I really enjoy that. I will continue to use this keyboard for as long as I can.
5,This keyboard works great and i can't say enough about how pretty it is! I love the typewriter style keys and the pretty green gradient. I brought it to my office to use at my work desk and my coworkers are just as obsessed as I am. The matching mouse is an added bonus and really ties together the book and style I was going for..
5,This keyboard is so cute. And the matching mouse - I'm in love. My normal keyboard is great for gaming but as someone who enjoys writing as well I just love the shape and sound of a keyboard with larger keys. Now this keyboard is longer than the typical keyboard I'm used to but desktop users will probably never notice the difference of its size. I enjoy that the keys are spaced apart and defined along with the addition of the number pad. I'll only use this keyboard to write - as I am now - but I think it'll be such a fun piece of tech to keep around. The colors are vibrant the keystroke is soft and I recommend this to anyone who wants a spark of color in their home office or just in general. Practicality never looked so good!
5,Hangs over the edge a little bit but honestly who really cares.... it does its job and is pretty dang good at it
5,I purchased this for my future computer. I love the different oddly shaped keys and the colors. I turned it on and everything works. This would be great for college students.
2,Uses battery fast!
5,I personally bought this keyboard for aesthetic purposes. I saw the cutest keyboard in Fryâs electronics and it looked very similar to this one and so I had to grab this one. So cute and love the noise that the keys make. The only downside that I could find is the fact that there is no side numbers which Iâm use to.
2,I have only had this keyboard for a couple months and it has already stopped working.
2,The mouse is very convenient. THE KEY BOARD STOP WORKING AFTER only 2 weeks. A
5,I love this set much more than the regular key board! The mouse is much more comfortable for my wrist and I love the bubble buttons on the keyboard.
5,I really like how comfortable it is to type on this keyboard. The color and keys are just as described.The sleep mode is also a great feature.
1,I did not like this keyboard. There are no feet on the bottom. It slides all over the desk. Too light weight.
4,This keyboard and mouse set is so cute. The keyboard actually did take me a hot minute to get used to typing on it but now I love it. The mouse is basic but very responsive and I like the fact that the USB adapter is stored at the bottom so I donât lose it. I get so many compliments on this and itâs a nice alternative to the boring black keyboard Iâve always had.
5,Great keyboard mouse combo!  The keyboard looks cool retro and the mouse matches the keyboard.  They connected effortlessly with the included wifi dongle.What I like:1. Easy setup.2. Great color.3. Mouse is a nice extra bonus.4. Mechanical keys have a nice feel and sound.5. Good quality build.Note: (That's my own sticker on the spacebar in the picture)Bottom line:  There is nothing about this keyboard and mouse I do not like it is exactly what I was hoping it would be and more.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Â You need 2 AA batteries 1 for the mouse and 1 for the keyboard. Once you plug it into the usb port on your device its ready to go! Amd once you take out the plug it shuts off in a few seconds really great for battery life.I love the colors and its types nicely. Im not into playing games so i cant tell you of its good for game play or not.There is a indicator for low battery on the keyboard that is very useful as well. It included a little tool that you can use to sweep in-between the keys and pop them off as well to clean better.
3,does a fair job for my laptop.
1,half of the left side of the keyboard doesn't even work
5,All keyboards are highly reliable. When evaluating a keyboard the only real thing is comfort. The main point of this keyboard is the cool look and it succeeds at that. Part steampunk part elementary school this keyboard has style. And the keys feel heavy duty - better than the "free" keyboards that ship with desktop PCs. The drawback is the lack of comfort. The keys are slightly concave but since they are circles it feels different than regular keyboards with square keys. To type I have to pick each finger up higher off each key just slightly. It's fine to write short things like this review. But  I would never use it to write several pages. The mouse is comfortable and the thumb key does not get pressed by accident. But the mouse seems flimsy compared to the keyboard.
3,The fans do their job however the plastic is very poor quality.
1,I just wish it had tilts on the back not real comfortable
5,This keyboard is beautiful. I like the noise of a mechanical keyboard. With combination of led light animation make it more attractive.
1,Cheap returned
5,We got this to use with a gaming computer.It arrives ready to plug in and use.The keyboard comes with about 70% battery life.The mouse comes with about 50%.There is a tool included to make it possible to remove and clean the keys and board.It also comes with directions that are clear and easy to understand.They are well made.The keyboard unit is sturdy.The keys and mouse feel durable.The dongle that controls both is solid.To test it out we hooked it up with my husbands mini gaming PC.He plugged the dongle into the system and it was recognized immediately.They key strokes were instantly seen as well as the mouse clicks.The mouse was comfortable to hold and even after 4 hours of use there was no hand cramping.The keys and buttons depressed easily.The typing was very quiet.The bounce back on the keys and mouse buttons was quick so letter repetition and button choice repetition was flawless.The mouse slid and read perfectly.After testing out the features we took off 4 keys.They popped off easily without feeling like we would damage them or the board.They snapped back in place just as easily.We would buy this again.
1,My product didnât come with the USB port so I am unable to use!
5,Does the job as expected for the low price. Worth the buy.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â Very cute adds a very nice touch to any peach/tan colored set up. Only thing I dislike is that it has no number pad but that's fine for daily use and light gaming. It has really nice presets easy to set up and cycle through and it makes loud clicking sounds which I like.Overall a very cute and aesthetic keyboard which also works well and sounds nice
1,I bought it for how cute it looked but not worth the money. Imbalanced board. Given close proximity the keys tend to press down together when typing.
2,Press 2 or more keys at the time itâs annoying
5,Got this keyboard for my wife she wanted a "Fun" keyboard and she really likes this one.  Retro-lime color round keys have a long keystroke and nice click give a semi-old time typewriter feel.  maybe not great for an office but good for home use. Very limited instructions but set-up is easy plug and play.  Only issue is the mouse will go to sleep if you don't use it for a few minutes but if you click a button it will wake up.Overall she likes it 5 stars.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â I love her. Sheâs the pop of color I wanted. The serotonin I needed. It will definitely make you happy.In terms of quality: if youâre looking for a heavy expensive feeling keyboard this is much more budget. Itâs very light and honestly plasticity feeling. But it looks amazing. I wouldnât care either way as long as it holds up and as long as it worked when I plugged it in and put batteries in.Also tell me why I was baffled by the technology that the USB that was in the mouse connected both the mouse and the keyboard. I was way too amazed by that. This is obviously my first wireless set keyboard.As someone who is overstimulated by sounds way too easily the clicking doesnât get in my nerves. Itâs smooth. But all of yâall clickity clacks you find your own keyboards.
5,Itâs nice I will say that it only works on flat surfaces. If the keyboard is in your lap or on any sort of tilt it wonât work. I do really like the color scheme though and Iâm happy I have it. I think the sound it makes when typing is very relaxing. Which aside from direct to use is the main reason I got it. 10 out of 10 recommend.
5,Looks great on my desk love it
5,Absolutely love this item works great easy set up no issues well made!
5,With this KNOWSQT Wireless keyboard and Mouse Combo I feel like my fingers can fly across the keyboard and barely touch down yet I'm faster on a keyboard like this one. Such a light touch and the ergonomic shape makes it so much easier to type for hours. The sleep mode is very handy for saving energy plus keeping the keyboard new for a longer period of time. Great for gaming as well!
5,I love this keyboard and mouse. I use it everyday and it works great. The keys are like an old school typewriter and its cool. My daughters also like it. Easy to type on and will last a long time.
5,I am using this keyboard and mouse combo to write my review and I have to say this really brings back the enjoyment of a mechanical keyboard in a fashionable way.The mouse is very responsive! All of the buttons well and there is no lag time in either the mouse or keyboard as there can be with some Bluetooth setups.The keyboard is very easy to type on and has the raised index finger placement markers. All of the functions work correctly and the keyboard is very comfortable to use. It's a well-made keyboard and doesn't have a cheap "will break at anytime" feel to it.I have really enjoyed using these and the color is just the icing on the cake! If you want to add a little pop of color to your work space and enjoy the old school mechanical style keyboards you can't go wrong with this!
1,Only a select few of the keys actually worked and batteries werenât included.
5,You're not going to be using this for gaming or anything but this is a cute keyboard with a nice feel. The keys are membrane switches but they have a really smooth key press and a satisfying soft sound. The mouse is decent enough I like the scroll wheel and extra buttons.The wireless dongle is a typical low profile and has good reception. We use ours with our media laptop thats connected to the projector and it works great across the bedroom!
5,I am in love with the color combination and overall design of this keyboard.  The mouse was just an added bonus!  I love the vintage "typewriter" style keys and the hollow sound the keyboard makes when typing.  It just reminds me of the good old days.The item came quickly and arrived in perfect condition.  From unpackaging to using both the keyboard and the mouse took less than 5 minutes.  Just unpack plug in the USB put in the (AAA) batteries one in the mouse one in the keyboard and Voila~!  Modern computers just self install the hardware and you're ready to go!The keyboard shell is made of a thick plastic material which seems to be very durable.  I love how high up the keys are as that will make it easy to keep the keyboard clean with my electric blower.  The mouse is just ok but I didn't order this for the mouse.  It's just like any other mouse except you have to click it once after not using it for a few minutes to activate it.  I am assuming this is to make the battery last longer.Overall this keyboard is a great buy! Its unique easy and fun to use and it's affordable!
1,I had the keyboard for 5 months and then it stopped working. Also the keyboard and the mouse were not silent as advertised.
5,i am smitten with this keyborad. the colors the keys the sound it makes and how easily it connects is an absolute boba and pastel color loving person's dream. it is very easy and smooth to type on this. I will be bringing it in to my office for work because yes it is THAT comfortable and nice to type on!
5,This KNOWSQT Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo is super cute and quite pleasing to even glance at. It comes with the keyboard and matching mouse and the little USB to connect it for bluetooth.The colors are just adorable and aesthetically pleasing on my daughter's computer desk. It works well and appears and feels to be well made.
1,I got the wrong color. I will keep it for now. But be careful.
1,The keyboard doesnât work at all! Just put in brand new battery and doesnât work. Mouse does but the keyboard does not. Waste of money.
5,I am so in love with this keyboard..... it reminds me off the good old days its a shame that i just recently discovered them. i was always a person who loved to hear keyboards click now i am having a blast from the past with this keyboard . its sooooo worth the money. Dont second guess yourself rn get one!!!!!
5,Nice economical keyboard and mouse. Great function.
5,Love this high quality fan low price fast ship tysm
5,Me gusta mucho el teclado. Se ve muy bonito y las teclas se sienten bien al momento de escribir. Si estas acostumbrada a maquina de mecanografia no se te hara dificil acostumbrarte.El mouse es pequeno pero funcional cabe en espacios reducidos. Ambos funcionan a pila y se conectar a la compuratora mediante el mismo recibidor. Asi no te consume espacio para conectar 2 USB.
5,I absolutely love my KNOWSQT Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo the moment I opened the packaging up! I wasn't too sure what to expect when I ordered it but it surpassed all my expectations with the following features that are out of this world:- The keyboard and mouse both have some nice weight behind them which I really like because the keyboard isn't prone to slipping all over the place and the mouse isn't fragile in the least. Both very sturdy!- Connectivity to my Mac and PC was effortless! Just plug in the USB receiver plug into your device and it automatically recognizes your keyboard as well as your mouse with no effort required on your part.- I love the detachable keycaps that make it very simple to clean the keyboard plus they are of a nice round shape that is big enough to rest your fingers upon without actually depressing the key accidentally.- I feel that the price is right on par for the overall quality craftsmanship of both the keyboard and the mouse as well as the beautiful chic aesthetic which I have not seen on any other keyboard/mouse combo.I 100% recommend this keyboard/mouse combo not only because it is pleasing to the eye but it is fully functional in getting all your work tasks done in no time at all!
5,I love the look and feel of this keyboard and mouse. It is very convenient to only have to use one dongle to operate both devices. My weary old laptop is getting a new lease on life with their help. The keyboard has a wonderful typewriter-like feel and responsive keys. The good AND bad? As my younger son figured out in nothing flat the keys can be pulled right out. He did it as a joke to change the orientation of a few keys and move around some others just to prank me but if they are that easy to manipulate it will be easy for a young one to take out and swallow. The good news is that the spaces between the keys are easy to get to when you are cleaning the bad news is that you might nod off with your toddler and wake up screaming "Spacebaaaar" as your teething toddler shoves it into their mouth. So keep it away from the kiddos and you'll have a beautiful and responsive set that should last a long time.
5,Ordered the keyboard to use with my older model (circ 2013) MacBook Pro that has a a built in USB port. Super easy to link the wireless keyboard and mouse to the laptop was using the nano USB receiver (truly a plug and play hook-up - no software download needed). The keyboard and mouse requires 2 AA batteries (not included).The aesthetics of the keyboard is fantastic and the keys are smooth to the touch and has the nostalgic tactile typewriter feel that I was looking for. I am not the fastestest typest so not sure if the keyboard would be too clunky for someone who can type 60+ WPM. I have not experienced any lag time while typing . . .Realistically I never clean my keyboard but it's great to know that the keys are removeable just in case they need to be cleaned. I ordered the "Sweet" color. It has a neutral base with a hint of blush color. Looks great on my desk and the color really "pops".
5,If you're something that breaks the mold of your standard everyday computer keyboard this is it.  Unlike a lot the unique styles on the market this one is  full size with separate space for Number pad and up/down/left/right buttons.  I already had a leather wrist rest and just by chance it's the perfect color match.  The button are not silent but not cheap clack sounding.  It is a bit higher off the desk than a lot and with the raised round buttons makes it feel even higher but with my wrist rest it's the perfect height.  The mouse is a little odd shaped I don't know If I'm quite used to it yet but I'll give it a chance.  The keyboard also has flip up legs on the rear if you're the type that like a little more angle when you type.I tried to figure out if there was a logic behind the key color pattern but nah...It's just that kind of funky style.
5,If you're looking to make a statement with your keyboard look no further!  This keyboard is dramatic and bold a real conversation piece for anyone who is looking for something a little different. Functionally it's a keyboard and works exactly like a USB dongle-connected wireless keyboard should.  The colors and details of this keyboard are captured well by the photography it's accurately described in the product description.  If you like what you see in this one you will not be disappointed when you get it.
5,Great keeps my laptop really cool no issues
5,Green is her favorite color  and this fits the bill. It works well and is comfortable to use and is cute as a bugs ear.
5,If you have ever used and have nostalgia for an old school typewriter or keyboard from the 90s you will absolutely adore this keyboard. The colors are soft and gorgeous. The keys are smooth and feel good to the touch. When youâre typing the keys clickety clack with a very soothing sound. Itâs literally plug and play with the dongle being on the underside of the mouse so setup is a breeze. The mouse works very well and complements the keyboard. This would make an excellent graduation gift or as a gift to anyone who appreciates a lovely keyboard.
1,They keyboard doesnât have its own usb receiver and does not work this was a waste of money
1,It doesnt even come with the battery that is says it should be provided with
5,It took some getting used to at first with its Retro typewriter style buttons but it is a fantastic keyboard! Sturdy great design. Goes well with the office design!!!
1,The keyboard came broken... only half the keys worked.
1,I donât like that it shuts off after seconds of using it.
5,I got this for my better half and after iterating through a few keyboards this one she loves.  Great looking easy to use.  Comes with a cleaning brush and the typewriter-style keys easily come off.  This is a winner.
5,I love my new keyboard and mouse the keys feels smooth and it's stylish and the color combination with the blush pink brown  nude and cream is perfect. Everything works great. I couldn't believe I only needed one AA battery for each one. Love it
5,works well
5,Worked great for Dell inspiring 7720 se.
2,though its cute the lights dies In a matter for two weeks and it broke super easily. Would not recommend for a gaming setup maybe for something for casual where it's going to get less use.
5,Keyboard with mouse easy to set up and use right away. Great value for the price! Sleep mode works good.
1,The keyboard does not work at all...
5,Very well  made easy setup. I like that this has the bulky keys that make more sound reminds me of an old typewriter!
5,Does the job nice and quiet.
3,I hate the keyboard on my laptop because one of the shift keys is smaller than normal which creates a ton of issues when Iâm typing. This hasnât been a big deal but now that Iâm in graduate school itâs really a pain. I loved the look of this keyboard and mouse combo and and thought it would be great for my needs. It looks great but I donât love it. Iâm a quick typer and had to go back a number of times to fix corrections because letters were missed; I think because I didnât press the key hard enough. Thatâs not a normal issue I have with other keyboards. The mouse does not work well. Several times I checked because I thought it quit working because it didnât respond when I tried to use them.Both products are bigger than expected. The mouse is bigger than any mouse Iâve used in the last ten years. If you have big hands you may appreciate that.  I was really surprised by how big the keyboard is. Also if you have big hands it may be more useful as it gives plenty of space. I donât have big hands so I would have appreciated a little smaller items.This keyboard and mouse are also a little louder than other ones with the clacking every key press or mouse press. I had considered taking this to the office and using it but the clacking would probably annoy all of us. Plus the lack of sensitivity of the keys would be an issue. Overall this works and is better than my laptop keyboard but itâs not my favorite.
5,This this is AWESOME!
5,very fast like it
5,great
4,Note: I was provided with a sample of this product in order to conduct an honest review.I will start by saying that the shape and relative thickness of this cooling pad were actually pluses in that it's wide enough to accommodate a 17" laptop and still have enough fan coverage to hit all the open slats/cooling areas underneath it as well as not be obtrusive.The fans themselves even at the highest setting are very quiet and move a fair amount of air given that they're only powered by a 5v USB cable.Speaking of the USB cable the internal storage for it is a very nice feature I just wish there was a slight lip to catch the cord. What I did notice however is that once you have it wound around the internal cylinder if you place the USB male ends into the clip with their cordage above the rest of the cable it holds it in place relatively well. Kudos on that design.There are a couple of things I noticed that irk me.In order to use this cooling pad you *must* use it with the included legs as there are no additional intake areas on the sides of the pad. This means that you either need to raise the angle by 1 inch or 2.25 inches. While this might not seem like an issue for some ergonomically speaking a flatter typing surface is actually better for your wrists vs one set at an incline. This could be fixed by opening a few areas to the sides of the fan blades allowing for an intake of air from the sides.The USB 2.0 ports on the back don't seem to be "high speed" spec but rather regular USB 2.0. This is good for providing power but not so great when it comes to file transfers to and from thumbdrives unless the files are relatively small.There is significant flex in the frame (note: only one way will it flex the weight bearing portion is held stiff by the metal frame this is a good design but I am only making a note of this in case you transport it in a backpack so you can avoid snapping it in half) due to it being completely plastic underneath the metal mesh used as a platform for your laptop.The lighting for the fans is mandatory as long as the set of fans is turned on the lights must remain on. I would really like a non-lighted option as I don't always want my laptop to look like a big square UFO.Also my unit appeared to have a round hole covered by a sticker next to the fan rheostat controllers. Not sure what this was supposed to have been used for but it would be the perfect place to put a simple switch for deactivating the lights in the fans.The fans move enough air to be very effective even with two of them turned off and two down to their lowest setting this still knocks out a couple degrees during gaming however when they're turned to max there is a marked 10* C decrease in CPU temp which in turn keeps framerates from dropping too much.It's also an extremely stable platform given the front mounting legs that keep your laptop from sliding off of the cooler in the event that you use the much higher legs on the bottom to give it more of an incline and allow for more air to be moved by the fans.All that said I would still rate this unit four stars as it does completely cool the surface of the mesh which helps push cooler air into your laptop.
2,This keyboard is super satisfying to type on but it wonât connect for me. I have followed the directions completely but unfortunately I am trying to connect it to a Mac laptop. As you probably know many manufacturers have removed USB ports from laptops and now require you to use an external adapter to get access to USB ports. When I try to set up this item through the adapter the mouse works but the keyboard wont connect. Apple will not recognize it. Iâve tried removing the mouse battery and just connecting the keyboard it does not work. There are no lights on keyboard or any indication of power which may be to blame. I am not sure why itâs batter powered - would have much preferred a wired keyboard with backlights given the design. Iâve tried several fresh batteries and cannot get the keyboard to work at all. The mouse is cute but totally uncomfortable to use. Itâs for aesthetic only the scrolling feature is not adequate for work or gaming. I canât recommend this item for laptop users. Experience with a desktop computer may be better.
5,Heat is the main killer of computers and computer equipment so keeping a system cool and ventilated is a big deal especially when involving systems that see heavy use. Laptops are just as vulnerable as larger servers and require the same precautions. One of the main solutions for heat dissipation and ventilation for laptops is a chill pad (a fan-based platform that moves air under the system) and this one by AMNIE has been outstanding. I have been using it for about two weeks on my personal system and likely will swap it over to the system in the house that sees the heaviest use.This is a good-sized pad able to comfortably handle laptops up to 17â. It has a total of 4 larger fans that move some serious amounts of air and fans are paired two and two between a pair of switches. The frame is painted metal mesh and offers good support to the laptop it holds.The switches that control the fans are dial controls and they provide variable fan speeds for each pair of fans they control. There are no graduations so you can set the speed anywhere within the range to suit you though having that much control is probably not all that necessary. The fans run very quiet but on the highest speed setting really move the air. When maxed out and all four fans running at top speed the fans blew cooler air from between the frame and the laptop telling me I had the speed up much higher than needed. For my particular system under my typical use load it seems I only need to turn them on about half way.I have worked with some chill pads that have flaws in either the fans or the bearings and they make awful amounts of noise. So far the only noise this pad makes is a low-frequency hum. It is quiet enough that even with lower-end noise canceling headphones I can cancel out the noise completely. This pad is not silent even on the low end of fan speed but it is very quiet all the way through the range of speeds. I have been able to leave the fans on full speed all night and sleep through the sound.I have not measured the temperature difference between when the fans are on vs. when they are not but I have noticed that the internal fan does not kick in as frequently when doing video rendering as when the fans are off. It does turn on and it still hits high speed on occasion but it is noticeably less frequently.This is an excellent chill pad for laptops and so far it has worked out exceptionally well for me. It is quiet it moves a lot of air and my laptopâs internal fan does not kick in as high as often. Because there is a system in the house that is much more frequently used for gaming I will be moving this pad to that laptop instead and will use the other pad for myself.Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias based solely on my experience with it.
4,REVIEW FOR GAMERS!The AMNIE laptop cooling pad is definitely one of the better laptop cooling pads I have owned.  It is lightweight and very portable so you can use your laptop anywhere without worrying about burning your lap or having your laptop overheat.  It's perfect when I want to use it on my bed to just relax and play some videogames.  Before my laptop overheated a lot because of the bed but now I can game much longer without worrying about it.  The cooling aspect (on my desk) of this product is ok but not too noticeable on my laptop.  At an idle state my CPU TEMPS dropped by 2-3ËC and my GRAPHICS TEMPS dropped by 2-3ËC.  To be fair I have a monster laptop (Lenovo y510p) with 2x GEFORCE 750M graphics cards (and Intel Core i7 4700MQ @ 2.4GHz) running with sli enabled.  It's hard to cool this beast down.The fans are also fairly quiet and provide a decent amount of airflow.  The extra USB ports are nice aswell for your phone or other devices.  Braided USB to USB cord too so it doesn't tangle.  Again I like that it is lightweight and portable so I can game on my laptop anywhere without worrying about it overheating too much.  Overall I like this laptop cooling pad and would recommend it to others.Disclosure: " I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and in return I would provide my honest opinion"
5,I received this keyboard from my wishlist for my desk at work. I wasn't specifically looking for a quiet keyboard just something cute wireless and perhaps just a little less "clacky". This set arrived in perfect condition.The keyboard and the click of the mouse are both pretty quiet. The keyboard does have a little noise but it is soft and muted. I am a fast and furious typer and no longer feel like I am disturbing my neighbors when writing my emails. The keys are rounded and very cute and I was worried they would be too small for my fat fingers. They are perfectly sized and I have had no issues typing and getting the letters correct. A small detail that I really appreciate and didn't expect was the laser-etched letters. They do have a little bit of a texture which I happen to like but if you are someone who has texture aversions you may not love that. The laser-etched letters should prevent any fading with frequent use. The buttons are also matte rather than shiny which I prefer.The mouse sensitivity is perfect for me. I can use this with or without a mousepad. It is more responsive than my previous mouse but not so sensitive that it moves at the slightest touch. The scroll wheel is metal and textured which again anyone with texture aversions may dislike. The USB also comes neatly tucked into the mouse.The setup was fairly easy though for some reason my computer told me the setup wasn't able to complete though the keyboard and mouse were both working. I just chalked it up to my computer being outdated (it is) and have been using the set without issue.
3,This keyboard works really well and the mouse of very good. If you are clumsy like me donât buy it because it is not very resistant to water
5,Unique in shape this laptop cooling pad has four five inch fans accented with blue LED lights. Constructed with a combination of a plastic framework and a metal mesh that covers the top of the fans it is both lightweight and sturdy. Included is a twenty-four inch woven nylon covered USB 2.0 cable. The back of the unit has two USB 2.0 ports â plug the cable into one port and the other into the laptop. The extra port replaces the one used by the cooling pad.User friendly this device has well-thought out features like fold-out supports at the front lower edge to ensure the laptop does not slip off the bottom of the pad. This is a particularly useful if it is being used with the back fold-out legs extended. There are two different heights for the back fold-out legs â one inch or two and a quarter inches or it can be used flat so the user can select whichever angle works best for them.The controls consist of two rotary (wheel) switches with each controlling two of the fans so the user can select whether to use only the top two or the bottom two or all four at once. The laptop cooling pad operates very quietly so there is no annoying noise issue. Solidly made the device is a real asset when extended use or age causes laptop heat build-up. Review sample received.
4,Bought this for my co-worker. It's very nice but it doesn't have "feet" to prop up the keyboard. It just lays flat which she doesn't really like. So I'm a little disappointed.
5,I have a 15.6" HP touchscreen laptop and this is the perfect fit for it. The base has two pairs of different length legs to you can have the base flat or at either of two angles. BUT - the legs need to be used when cooling the laptop otherwise air flow is severely restricted. The top and bottom sets of fans have independent power and speed controls. Most importantly the pad keeps my laptop cool.It's not perfect though. There are two little plastic arms that swivel up from the base to prevent the laptop from sliding down.  These pop out with very little force.  My wrists bumped them a couple of times and popped them out.  I also wish the LED's could be turned off. If I'm using this in a dark room the LED's are distracting. The extra USB port on the rear appears to be USB 2 not 3.Standout features: Totally powered by the laptop's USB port. You can also power from any USB battery pack. Four fans for even cooling and lots of air movement. Internal cable storage.This has a permanent place on my desk with my happy laptop parked on top.Free sample provided for honest review.
5,is there a way to get a new usb adapter ? i lost it and now i can not use the products.
3,* review sample providedThe Amnie Laptop Cooling Pad provides nearly silent substantial cooling in a unique looking design. The pad holds up to a 17 inch laptop but with an 11 inch Mackook Air the pad cools well enough to chill the laptop and provide a nice breeze for the person using it. Fan less are cobalt colored and very pretty and the usb cable has a nice quality braided cord.Excellent product while it lasted but unfortunately it died within a couple of months.
5,Keeps the laptop nice and cool.  Also it catches some of the dust and I don't have to clean the laptop as often.
5,I was hesitant to purchase this because of some of the reviews here but I absolutely love it! I ordered pink - it is a great color and it works perfectly so far!
3,I got this mainly for the color to match a build I was doing as a gift but they do not feel like they will last.
1,Bought this dec 2020 and the keyboard no longer works anymore after almost 3 months. Tried changing the battery to it and the mouse works but keyboard is done.
5,I get so many compliments over my pretty keyboard! have had for a few months now and still working great!
4,Love it
5,Love it. Bought it for work. Cute colors doesn't feel cheap  perfect size.
5,I work from home and was tired of the amount of cords behind my computer. This set is perfect for daily use. Easy to set up and the color is so cute! Have been using for a few  months now and so far no issues!
5,Very lightweight pretty colors materials feel resistant amazing battery life.
5,I love the way this keyboard looks!  Also as someone who learned to type on a typewriter this keyboard has a great feel!
5,Very useful. works perfectly with my macbook air. looks very decent. pop keys are very satisfying.
5,This is so cute and was such a great deal! Iâve had it for a few months now and I still get excited to use it. Itâs very aesthetic and comes in multiple color schemes. As soon as you turn your computer on it connects fast. No cord and long range.My only complaint is that I wish the click-clack sound were a bit more satisfyingâ¦more 9 to 5 office striking. But other than that itâs perf.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â I just received the keyboard today. I am currently typing this review on it and it seems alright so far. However I must point out that the branding of the keyboard as advertised on here (KNOWSQT) did not match 'exactly' what I received. Prior to making this purchase I had noted that the spacebar had the logo of this said brand however the keyboard which I received seemingly has no brand on it at all; it came with a 'Mofii' instruction guide which is confusing since that isn't the brand which I had ordered. Nonetheless the correct color was sent to me (milk tea) and other than the branding/logo issue everything else matches up. This set did not come with the two double A batteries needed to use the items despite the instruction manual saying it did contain batteries. Still not too big of a deal. I was fortunate to receive the updated version of the mouse so far so good. Typing does make the click noise which is what I had wanted. So that's a plus. I am still trying to adjust to the keyboard itself and I may update this review as time goes by to see how it holds up. Overall though I am satisfied with my purchase despite the few flaws. Iâve attached a short video of myself typing (excuse the slowness lol still adjusting) Hope this helps.
5,It is really beautiful I think the color is even prettier than the picture! I can't wait to use it! And currently I think it's also really comfortable to use as well. the sound of the mechanical keyboard is just what I want. Also you don't need to press too hard to type words which is exactly what I need! Overall I'm really satisfied with the purchase!
5,The keyboard mouse combo are connected smoothly with MacBook without jamming. Although the hand feel is as good as the mechanical keyboard the appearance is very good. The mouse buttons are very sensitive and the good to use.
5,Loved the keyboard and mouse.  Very attractive and also very functional.  Wireless is also a great function.  I would recommend this to anyone.  This is my first keyboard and mouse in years and I'm just pretty proud of it.  The raised keys make it easier to use also.
5,The keyboard stops getting signal after 2 weeks. Who ever hears of a keyboard going dead so fast. This company makes and sells junk. I wouldn't trust anything from them.
5,I am completely satisfied. Everything in the description is accurate. I had an issue with my platoon keyboard and this one is working amazing.
4,I really like how it feels when typing on this keyboard. Its very nostalgic to the old keyboards we had in the 90's but this one is more comfortable to use and its wireless and the color is just the cutest! Ive been using this everyday since i got it and inever had problem using it i think im used to it anf will not going back to slimmer keyboard.
5,Comes with a mouse matches my laptop stand. I love it!
5,Very nice looking and functions well. When it arrived it was damaged & the company instantly resolved this with me without delay. The keyboard is very comfortable and the keys are smooth and not stiff or too flat like other keyboards. Only takes 1 battery in each which is nice and only one USB mini receiver needed to use both devices. Would definitely recommend if you can wait for shipping as it can take long sometimes.
5,Just as pictured! Lovely color just what I wanted. Keyboard is sturdy. As other reviewers have pointed out it doesn't have the little feet that flip out to elevate the keyboard to the "correct" position but I'm not typing out a novel or anything so it's no bother. Mouse feels cheap...light and plastic-y. It works fine though and is comfortable. Setup was easy and the volume controls on the keyboard are a great feature.
4,It works it's cute and it wasn't too much money. I don't like how the keys are spaced out but it works for what I need it for. Probably would invest more into a better one next time.
5,Conforme Ã  la description. Convient Ã  mes besoins.
4,Update I have found that this cooler has great airflow and does keep my Asus ROG much cooler although it may be the placement of the laptops vents. As I said below the front flip up stopper for bigger heavier laptops are not up to the task and are way to flimsey but the rest of the construction is sturdy and the rubber feet on my Asus fit exactly with the slight lip of the cooler so my laptop is secure and does not move and it feels well anchored. In fact it is much better than the Antek which had plastic mirror effect cups which both my old Alienware M17 and the Asus both slid around moving about 4cm radius although neither could slip off due to the cups recess.I have been using an Antek cooler for over five years now in January I brought an Asus ROG G750JS laptop to replace my Alienware M17 Crossfire. The vents on the Asus are in different locations to the Alienware and the Antek it not silent so I decided to get a new cooler and just use the Ankek for the Alienware.Upon receipt of the AMNIE AE-CP1501 15.6"-17" Laptop Cooler I noticed it is not a large as the Antek in fact my Asus overhangs the sides it also feels slightly more flimsy than my old cooler. The noise is around the same when you have all four fans cranked up fully (my old cooler only had the one fan). Overall is it a great cooler the fans give a good flow of air to the underside of the Laptop and overall construction is reasonably good.Pros:1: Light weight smaller so easier to carry than my old cooler.2: Provides more air to the outer edges of the laptop covering more of the vents on the ASUS.3: Adjustable two angle position (flat or raised) raised is more comfortable when using on a desk (for me that is).4: The fans on full speed give a decent flow of air to the back of the laptop and wider coverage or air than my old single fan.5: Option of having either set off or running at different speeds. Handy if using a smaller device such as a 11 or 10 inch machine.6: Aesthetically pleasing.7:Whilst the fans are not noisy they are easily audible. Much quieter than the Laptop fans especially on the Alienware as the Asus are quite quiet as gaming laptops go so I have added to pro.Cons:1: Build quality not as sturdy as old cooler but then in fairness it was a fraction of the price of the old one in 2009.2: When in the raised position the rubber stopper on the Asus are luckily placed just right to rest on slight indent at the corner of the cooler. But that is coincidental and as I said lucky the Alienware does not and so when set at an angle just slides off.3: A continuation on point two really but wanted to separate the points. The two little arms at the front of the cooler designed to lift and stop laptops slipping forward are obviously not built for most 17" gaming laptops. They are fixed with a pinchable mechanism at the bottom of the arm meaning they pop out quite easily. They just about hold the Asus as long as no external pressure like typing for example is applied to the laptop. The Alienware being much heavier than the Asus no chance they will not support it's weight and pop out.4: The shielding on the bottom of the cooler has quite big gaps easily big enough for an average adult finger to fit through having accidentally stuck my finger through and whilst the fans are not powerful enough to cause any real damage to my fingers should a small child do the same they would unlikely lose a finger but it would I imagine be very painful.5: Continuation on four again wanted to mark it as separate point because of the size of gaps in the shielding and position of fans if you were planning to use this on your bed or similar surface it would be easy for protruding material such as on a duvet to hinder the fans which I would imagine would cause the motor to fail.Summary: If you want a cooler for a 15" laptop Macbook a Razor or have a 17" Laptop with stopper in the same place as an Asus and plan to use of a desk or other hard flat surface then for the money this a great product. If you have a heavy laptop or want a cooler to rest your machine on whilst in bed or on a couch this might not be you best option.
4,ich habe eine Zeit lang intensiv nach so einem Coolpad gesucht und war mir nicht sicher und diese ganze Rezessionen die fÃ¼r viele solche Artikel dort abgegeben waren ob die auch real sind oder nicht beeinflusst worden sind weil mir so einige Rezessionen so bisschen Spanisch vorkamen immer die gleichen SÃ¤tze und immer die gleichen Beurteilungen.So entschied ich mich fÃ¼r diesen Coolpad weil ich einfach die Anordnung der Ventilatoren positiv platziert fand spricht viele cool Pads hatten 6 oder 8 oder 5 Ventilatoren die aber relativ schlecht platziert war nicht so diese schien mir.Dass ich recht behalten habe es war ich 3 Tage spÃ¤ter nach der Bestellung die Ware kam sehr pÃ¼nktlich und wirklich in einen super tollen Verpackung Karton ausgefÃ¼llt mit Ware und Schutzfolie und so weiter.Beim Auspacken der Ware war ich ebenfalls positiv Ã¼berrascht entgegen vielen negativen Rezessionen die meine Meinung nach irgendwie entweder gekauft oder keine Ahnung wie zustande gekommen sind Artikel war im Wald topfband da waren keine Kratzer daran keine Dellen oder Ã¤hnliches und alle Teile die dort beschrieben waren befand sich auch im Karton.Ich werde jetzt hier nicht stundenlang in kleine Coolpad fÃ¼r etwa 25 â¬ beurteilen wollen aber was ich sagen will ist dass er wirklich gut verarbeitet ist relativ leicht mit deinem Metallnetz bedeckt robust und stark genug um einen Laptop sowie meinen 156 Zoll zu tragen und da kÃ¶nnte locker noch ein grÃ¶Ãerer Laptop passen.Er hat zwei USB-Ports und zwei Regler fÃ¼r zwei Untere und jeweils zwei obere Ventilatoren die unabhÃ¤ngig voneinander an und aus gemacht werden kÃ¶nnen oder halt schneller oder langsamer reguliert werden kÃ¶nnen.Das blaue LED Licht ist natÃ¼rlich nett anzusehen es ist schÃ¶n dass sie da ist weil es einfach toll auch schaut eine wirkliche Funktion hat es allerdings nicht stÃ¶ren tut es aber auch nicht. Ich habe einige Rezession gelesen wo man dann beschreibt das da nur ein laues LÃ¼ftchen rauskommt ich kann das bei diesem GerÃ¤t echt nicht bestÃ¤tigen denn es hat genug Power um meinem Laptop zum Beispiel ein 156 Zoll Acer deutsche zu kÃ¼hlen so dass die Temperatur auch beim zocken nicht Ã¼ber 65 bis 70 Grad kurzzeitig ansteigt und dann wieder nach unten Richtung 45 54Â° runter gekÃ¼hlt wird.Die beiden beziehungsweise die 4 Ventilatoren sind relativ leise weil man kann sie nur dann hÃ¶ren wenn man sie hÃ¶ren mÃ¶chte irgendwie mÃ¼ssen die sich drehen und ein bisschen GerÃ¤usche machen wir wohl von sich selbst ist ja wohl logisch ist aber echt nicht die Rede wert angenehm und man kann es als leise bezeichnenMein gesamte Fazit fÃ¼r diesen Coolpad ist Ã¤uÃerst positiv ich kann es durchaus weiterempfehlen fÃ¼r den Preis von etwa 25 â¬ kann man echt nicht viel mehr erwarten da auch einige andere viel teurere GerÃ¤te schlechter sind wie dieses.Mein Laptop hat sich immer wieder ausgeschaltet weil er teilweise bis zu 90Â° beim Zocken warm wurde und jetzt habe ich beim zocken eine maximale Temperatur von 69 Grad also allein und Wiesengrund kann ich es weiterempfehlen sieht gut aus ist robust gebaut es ist komplett geliefert worden rechtzeitig und ordentlich verpackt.Ich habe jetzt vier Sternen gegeben weil ich ein paar klitzekleine Verbesserungen dort gesehen hÃ¤tte aber die sind so minimal dass Sie sich hier nicht erwÃ¤hnen mÃ¶chte um meine Rezession Objektiv abzugeben und sie nicht zu fÃ¤lschen.
5,Am Anfang war ich wirklich skeptisch ob das KÃ¼hlpad meinem Laptop mit seiner miesen KÃ¼hltechnik irgendwie weiterhelfen kÃ¶nnte aber ein paar Tests haben gezeigt: und ob!Erstmal ein paar Worte zu Verarbeitung und Co. Das Pad sieht allein fÃ¼r sich schon stylisch aus ich finde auch das blaue Licht im Betrieb sehr nett wer es jedoch nicht leiden kann findet keine Option zum Ausschalten das ist halt Geschmackssache. Wenn man aber so wie ich einen 173 Zoll Laptop darauf stehen hat sieht man von den LEDs gar nicht mehr viel nur wenns dunkel ist. ;) Wie gesagt Laptops dieser GrÃ¶Ãe nehmen das Pad komplett ein. Man kann es wahlweise flach auf dem Tisch stehen haben was aber die Leistung meines Erachtens erheblich(!) minimiert oder man nutzt die ausklappbaren FÃ¼Ãe die das GerÃ¤t in eine SchrÃ¤glage bringen - diese sind nicht(!) hÃ¶henverstellbar. Deshalb Achtung: wer nicht so schrÃ¤g arbeiten kann oder will der sollte lieber nach einem anderen Produkt schauen denn wie gesagt flach auf den Tisch gestellt bringt es nicht so viel. Die vier recht leisen LÃ¼fter lassen sich nun separat per Regler zuschalten man kann sie also sowohl ein und ausschalten als auch ihre IntensitÃ¤t verÃ¤ndern. Das Pad wird Ã¼ber USB angeschlossen verfÃ¼gt aber Ã¼ber einen zusÃ¤tzlichen USB-Anschluss sodass man quasi keinen verliert.Das Ergebnis bei voll aufgedrehter KÃ¼hlpower hat mich dann wirklich staunen lassen. Beim Prozessor hatte ich vorher immer mit recht grenzwertigen Temperaturen von bis zu 100 Grad zu kÃ¤mpfen die sind ca. um 5 bis 10 Grad zurÃ¼ck gegangen. Bei der Grafikkarte sieht das dann nochmal mehr aus da habe ich Temperaturunterschiede von bis zu 25 Grad gemessen! Das Resultat ist dann auch erstaunlich denn selbst bei vormals ruckelnden oder nur mit minimalen Einstellungen spielbaren Games kann ich nun in Ruhe und mit Genuss zocken. Gerade fÃ¼r lÃ¤ngere Sessions und fÃ¼r den Sommer wirklich eine optimale LÃ¶sung (zumal man die HÃ¤nde kostenlos mit gekÃ¼hlt bekommt :) )Wer kein Problem mit blauen LEDs und der "SchrÃ¤glage" des Pads hat der kann hiermit absolut nichts falsch machen die Ergebnisse sprechen fÃ¼r sich.
5,Having had a chance too use this fan for a few weeks now I can give an honest review of this product .... In my opinion and as the Title says this is THE BEST Laptop cooling fan out there! its so quiet! very quiet! so quiet you don't know its actually turned on apart from its Blue lights glowing from within each of the fans enclosures  the laptops own fans are louder  ..and the cooling quality is outstanding better than any I have tired or used before it ..it works its very best sat tilted up on its back feet giving and all round nice clean airflow around it and the laptop but although I have not tried I would think it would work under the laptop on your lap although  it would not be the heat from the laptop you would get discomfort from "a complaint many find of laptops used without a fan on your lap" it would probably be the coldness of the air drawn through the huge fans.Build quality is very good ..I would go as far too say that in the past I have gone for cheaper coolers that have had rave reviews  only to find them more noisy and weaker in build quality and with less power with cooling abilities which have only lasted between 3 and 6 months This one is running superb and looks as if it will carry on like that for many many months fingers crossed .....my laptop is on sometimes 24/7 for several days at a time from internet use to media music and films  and most of all online heavy resources draining virtual reality game  this fan is keeping the laptop running faster cooler and quieter then even the laptop did as it came out of its box. I use it running full speed although you can turn off two fans or reduce the fans over all speed using the variable speed dial on the back.With its reduced price of over 50% off marked price right now on amazon its a steal and anyone considering buying a fan cooler just get this one its 110% worth every single penny spent yeah my 17.3" laptop sits over its edges a bit  but it sits there tilted up and without using the the fold-out front tabs that could be used if it were a 15" or less laptop it does not budge.Total satisfaction with my purchase and comes very highly recommended to anyone considering any such a purchase.
4,Brought this item recently for my son for his laptop It works as intended but he has suffered some problems with it which i will make anyone thinking of buying it aware as a just in case its not just my sons.First of all the little plastic catches at the bottom to hold the laptop in place tend to fall down on there own with a slight knock or movement and if you lean over with it the laptop tends to slid off to the side as it does not have any grip pads on the sides to keep the laptops on.Second unfortunately although it was most likely the doing of my son rather than the product itself the usb cable that plugs into the cooling pad itself seems to have the wires broken inside as the fans no longer turn on and off he has admitted to when he places it down he did catch the wire a few times so just a heads up for how rough you handle the usb cables just in case.But all round it does as it said while it worked nice little product for table based used but NOT lap based or in bed use due to the open bottom of the product clothing / bedding and the occasional finger catches the fans as they spin.
5,I ordered this cooling pad almost two months ago and I am still impressed by this product. Originally I used a cheap cooling pad (one of the ones that's a sheet of plastic with three miniature fans in it) as my three year laptops fan was wearing out and I wanted to reduce the pressure on when I play games and use 3D modelling software etc. The original didn't really do much except make fairly load noises so decided to buy this one.This cooling pad looks great and fits my 15.6" laptop perfectly and is actually helping to reduce temperatures on my laptop with the four huge fans covering the entire base of the laptop. From what I can see it is cooling by around 5-10 degrees which is enough for me to heavily use my laptop and still keep temps away from damaging the CPU or graphics card.The pad itself is well built and sturdy the metal frame top does allow my laptop to slip gradually when set at an incline but there are catches at the bottom of the pad to stop it slipping off. At the back it has two sliders so you can control the speed of the fans and an additional USB socket so you don't need to have the fans on full if you prefer them to be quieter (although they are quiet at full anyway).Overall it is a great design that works exactly as it needed to. The only complaint I would have is that part of the front fans airflow does leak outwards which can be slightly uncomfortable but that is more an issue with my set up and its not a significant draft.
5,The box it arrives in is very nice and shows you what it looks like inside and when I took it out I was very impressed with the build quality. I liked also that it was light  It comes equipped with its own USB cable - one end plugs into the laptop cooling tray and the other into a USB port on your laptop.Its completely silent  I was quite amazed  its virtually silent in operation. One of its best features for me is that you can adjust the height of the slope.at the back. Both the 2 back levers and the front 2 fit flush back into the tray when you have finished using it so the tray remains totally flat for transportation or carrying etc.Within the attractive and strong metal mesh of the top of the laptop tray you can see the 4 10mm fans with blue LEDs lit spinning silently at around 1200 RPM cooling both the base of your laptop and its surroundings. Iv sat and  watched the fans spin for quite a while when  i plugged it in. Its a gorgeous bright blue LED! though you canât see much once you sit your laptop on top . The metal mesh is also an extremely stable surface for your laptop to sit on whilst also being quite  water resistant which is an added bonus.This tray will fit most sizes of laptops and has been tested with a 15â and 17.5â laptop by myself. I have used this tray whilst gamingvideo editing and running stability tests. desk or  knees. Its brilliant! either way and very comfortable to deal with! high recommended!
3,Ich habe mir den Laptop KÃ¼hler gekauft um meinen Gaming Laptop schneller abzukÃ¼hlen da die interne KÃ¼hlerleistung mit der Zeit nachgelassen hat und mein Laptop jetzt sehr schnell sehr heiÃ lÃ¤uft.Versand:ZunÃ¤chst einmal kam das Produkt sehr schnell an. Der Karton war fast doppelt so groÃ wie die eigentliche Verpackung des KÃ¼hlers. Als ich diese geÃ¶ffnet hatte sprangen mir erst einmal einige Plastik Teile entgegen. Als ich mir den KÃ¼hler dann anschaute welcher ungeschÃ¼tzt in seiner Verpackung lag musste ich feststellen dass am Rand einige Teile abgebrochen waren (siehe Bilder).Da dies aber keine nachteilige Beeinflussung auf die Funktion des GerÃ¤tes hatte habe ich mich gegen eine RÃ¼cksendung entschieden.Betrieb:Ich habe den KÃ¼hler unter meinem Laptop angeschlossen und in Betrieb genommen. Zuerst musste ich feststellen dass die KÃ¼hler mir nicht so viel Luft entgegenbringen konnten wie ich von einem 4-LÃ¼fter-System erwartet hatte. Aber ich dachte dass es eventuell trotzdem ausreicht. Die Bewertungen zeugten davon.Ich habe dann einige Zeit an meinem Laptop 'gedaddelt'  und ihn heiÃ laufen lassen. Zufriedenstellend war es festzustellen dass mein Laptop mit dem untergelegten KÃ¼hler viel langsamer warm wurde als zuvor was ja auch der Sinn des GerÃ¤tes sein sollte.Nach etwa 2 Stunden habe ich dann festgestellt dass mein Laptop extrem heiss war so wie schon vor der Benutzung des KÃ¼hlers. Dieser kam anscheinend nach einiger Zeit nichtmehr hinterher mit dem KÃ¼hlen trotz hÃ¶chster Einstellung und mein Laptop erreichte wieder einmal atemberaubende Temperaturen. Schade!ZusÃ¤tzlich ist zu sagen dass der KÃ¼hler leider nicht wie in der Beschreibung ''flÃ¼sterleise'' arbeitet. Es ist generell bekannt dass gerade Gaming Laptops bei lÃ¤ngerem Betrieb auch mal etwas lauter werden kÃ¶nnen jedoch war der untergelegte KÃ¼hler tatsÃ¤chlich noch etwas lauter als mein Laptop was ich zwar etwas enttÃ¤uschend aber nicht allzu stÃ¶rend fand.Fazit:Wer nicht lange spielt und sein GerÃ¤t nicht allzu warm werden lÃ¤sst kann sich mit diesem LÃ¼fter eine kleine Abhilfe schaffen. Er hÃ¤lt die Temperatur fÃ¼r einige Zeit in MaÃen. Nach lÃ¤ngerer Benutzung wird er jedoch nahezu unbrauchbar und leistete - in meinem Fall - kaum mehr Abhilfe. FÃ¼r diese doch niedrige KÃ¼hlleistung ist ein Preis von ''nur'' 24â¬ meines Erachtens nach sogar noch zu hoch. Dann lieber ein paar â¬ mehr in ein besseres GerÃ¤t investieren als seinen Laptop schmelzen zu lassen.
4,So I received this item today and it was damaged. The two fans at the bottom of the cooling pad are faulty. It seems to me that this item isn't really that durable as suggested by another reviewer.EDIT***After writing my initial review where I received the original item as being damaged I was contacted by the seller who offered an excellent solution. The new item I received was in excellent condition and is now preventing my laptop from overheating. I would give it 5 stars but there are still some issues with durability with regards to the legs which hold up the laptop only containing sponge underneath as opposed to rubber which would have been a better option.I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is sick of their laptop overheating and needs an effective product which helps to significantly reduce temperatures.If any customer has a question about this product please feel free to leave a comment on my review where I will be happy to provide you a very quick response.
4,Good product and does what is asked of it. I bought this for my new gaming laptop and keeps it cool when I need it to. Rise of the tomb raiser was sometimes making my cpu reach 96 degrees so I stopped playing it until this arrived. Now it will rarely hit 90 which was better than i expected.It looks great and you can turn the fans up and down but i wouldn't say that its exactly quiet and is louder much louder than my laptop without load. When my laptop is under load (which i expect most peoples are to get so hot) the fans from the laptop would drown the sound out of the cooler and for that reason I am happy with it. Using it for normal everyday tasks though would get slightly annoying but that was not what i wanted it for.Would recommend if noise isn't an issue and your laptop is usually quiet also. (I am not sure what other laptop coolers are like so these might be quiet in comparison)
5,Zuerst dachte ich naja...aber dann war ich doch sehr positiv Ã¼berrascht.Da sich mein 17" Laptop doch immer gern im Bereich der W-A-S-D-Tasten ( also auch gleichzeitig Handauflagenbereich) beim Spielen schnell aufgeheizt hat da der interne KÃ¼hler dies nicht mehr gepackt hat habe ich mir diesen KÃ¼hler geholt. Durch die hochklappbare Funktion des KÃ¼hlers ist das ganze etwas gewÃ¶hnungsbedÃ¼rftig. Hier muss gesagt sein dass ich meist nur mit Maus und einer G13-Gamepad arbeite da in dem knapp 30Â° Winkel es fÃ¼r das Handgelenk nach kÃ¼rzerer Zeit zu KrÃ¤mpfen kommen kann. Wer also sehr gerne einen guten KÃ¼hler hat und mit einer zusÃ¤tzlichen Tastatur keine Probleme hat dem kann ich diesen KÃ¼hler nur empfehlen.Im eingeklappten Modus kÃ¼hlt er zwar auch aber meiner Meinung nach nicht so effektiv.Die Hinteren und die Vorderen beiden KÃ¼hler kÃ¶nnen separat angesteuert werden. Entweder ganz aus( dann auch licht aus) und dann gibt es eine sehr kurze spanne zwischen an( LÃ¼fter dreht sich langsam) bis DrehrÃ¤dchen am Anschlag( LÃ¼fter auf voller Leistung)Im groÃen und ganzen bin ich sehr zufrieden damit.
4,Das KÃ¼hlpad macht seinem Namen alle Ehre mein Toshiba Satellite wird gerne warm  mit dem AMNIE gibt es keine Probleme mehr.Gut finde ich die MÃ¶glichkeit jeweils 2 der 4 Ventilatoren abschalten zu kÃ¶nnen das spart Energie und der Betrieb wird etwas leiser. Hat man alle 4 Ventilatoren auf Vollgas  dann blÃ¤st es schon deutlich spÃ¼rbar unter dem Laptop hoch. HandkÃ¼hlung auf dem Touchpad ist also inbegriffen. Die Drehzahlregulierung ist aber leider zu gering ausgefallen kaum merklich ist der Unterschied. Etwas sinnlos empfinde ich die Beleuchtung das braucht unnÃ¶tig Strom denn bei Akkubetrieb ist der Verbrauch des Pads schon deutlich spÃ¼rbar.Einen Stern ziehe ich ab weil einer der klappbaren Halter die das Runterrutschen des Laptops verhindern sollen bei einem ungeschickten Transportversuch kaputt gegangen ist. Das kÃ¶nnte bei dem Preis gerne etwas stabiler konstruiert sein.
5,Halloich habe mir den KÃ¼hler bestellt da mein laptop vom haus aus ein defektes KÃ¼hlsystem hat. Das gerÃ¤t wurde immer unertrÃ¤glich heiÃ selbst bei nicht so anspruchsvollen Aufgaben wie Animes schauen bis letztendlich der LaptopabstÃ¼rzte. Diese Hitzeentwicklung war so hoch dass ich die Unterseite des GerÃ¤ts nicht anfassen konnte.Nun habe ich den KÃ¼hler bestellt und ich muss sagen dass das gerÃ¤t 1a ist.Er ist kaum hÃ¶rbar und kÃ¼hlt so verdammt gut dass ich ohne Probleme 4 K videos anschauen kann.Mein Laptop wird dabei nicht mal wirklich warm. Ich schalte momentan sogar die unteren 2 KÃ¼hler aus und es reicht vÃ¶llig.Ich hatte mir erhofft dass es eine passable KÃ¼hlleistung gibt aber von so etwa hÃ¤tte ich nie getrÃ¤umt.FÃ¼r mich eine klare Kaufempfelung!!!Noch etwas zum Aussehen fÃ¼r mich sieht es eleganter aus als bei den Bildern und somit nicht nur fÃ¼r Zocker geeignet auÃerdem gibt es nach unten hin "klappstÃ¤nder" die ein rutschen des laptops verhindern sollen was sehr gut klappt.
4,It does improve cooling if you position your laptop correctly. Is a bit noisy the should have used low rpm fans for high static presure not airflow fans. It blows dust alot but if you keep your environment clean this shoud not be a problem. On the plus side it is sturdy has good elevation and the slip stops are great. The rpm controlers are a great addition and the cable is very nice and braded which is important. The LED's are good not to bright not too dark. Overall solid cooler and if the fans were a little bit more quiet it could have been the best.
1,Es krabbeln unglaublich viele kleine Insekten in den Ventilator vermutlich angezogen vom Licht.Die toten Schalen sehen extrem ekelig aus und fallen ab und zu unten durch.Die Ventilatoren fangen irgendwann an sich zu verbiegen machen ein nerviges KlappergerÃ¤usch und die Lampen flackern bis die einzelnen Ventilatoren gar nicht mehr gehen.Es war schÃ¶n solange es gedauert hat aber es ist ein Saison Produkt das man nach einem halben Jahr wegschmeiÃen kann.
5,Ich habe hier einen 4 Jahre alten Samsung-Laptop mit dem ich meine Urlaubsvideos bearbeite und schneide. Vor einiger Zeit begann das Hitzeproblem d.h. nach ein paar Clips in meiner Videosoftware ging der Laptop mitten bei der Arbeit einfach aus. Wegen Ãberhitzung abgestÃ¼rzt. Nun habe ich keine laufende Temperaturanzeige-Software installiert brauche ich auch nicht denn gefÃ¼hlt sind einige GehÃ¤useteile so heiÃ dass man Spiegeleier drauf braten kÃ¶nnte.Dann habe ich das KÃ¼hlpad gekauft und den Laptop draufgestellt. Ich war zunÃ¤chst skeptisch da mein Laptop-GehÃ¤use-Unterteil nur wenige LÃ¼fterschlitze besitzt. Aber es funktioniert. Sogar ganz fantastisch. Die ehemals Spiegeleier heiÃen GehÃ¤useteile sind gefÃ¼hlt handwarm und meine Videosoftware lÃ¤uft wieder sauber durch. Der LautstÃ¤rkepegel ist nach meinem subjektiven Empfinden unverÃ¤ndert da der interne Laptop-KÃ¼hler nun nicht mehr permanent auf hÃ¶chster Drehzahl heult dafÃ¼r aber ein leichtes Grundrauschen dazu gekommen ist.Ich finde das Teil klasse somit volle Punktzahl.
5,I only found out these existed earlier in the week after googling for solutions to my overheating laptop.  Blimey there is a whole host of solutions out there :)  I settled on this one due to the good reviews and discounted price.  So far so impressed... been using all day today with my laptop (a 3 year old Sony Vaio prone to getting very hot within half an hour of use) and have regularly checked the laptop underneath with my  hand only to find it as cool as if it were switched off.  Its quiet and light and I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner... was nearly at the point of replacing the whole laptop cos I was fed up with its hotness but otherwise everything about the laptop is great and this may now well prolong its life extra :)  Great recommended.
5,Absolute beast of a cooling fan. Does exactly what you want it to. Better to go all out and get this than get some of the cheaper and fragile ones out there. Trust me I have been that silly before. only a minor design flaw. There are two detachable pin like structures that are meant to hold your laptop in place in the event that it is too heavy and tries to slip off. Now these pins tend to come off after a while. All u need do is push it back in. It's no trouble at all unless you have a gigantic gaming laptop like myself. The laptop will remain in place but as a I love perfection it just nibbles at me that's all. So yeah go ahead and get this product if you are contemplating it. You won't regret it.
4,Das Produkt erfÃ¼llt seinen Zweck und ist dabei im Vergleich zu den bisherigen zwei KÃ¼hlpads das leiseste. Ich hatte vor den Kauf noch bedenken ob irgendwann das Plastikgitter beim Transport beschÃ¤digt werden kÃ¶nnte. Dies hat sich bisher noch nicht bewahrheitet. Warum ich nur vier Sterne vergebe liegt daran das ich den Neigungswinkel im Gegensatz zu den anderen Produkt unangenehm hoch finde woran man sich aber nach einiger Zeit gewÃ¶hnen kann. Des Weiteren sind die beiden untenangebrachten drehbaren kleinen Halterungen scharfkantig ausgefÃ¼hrt was bei einem niedrigen Laptop nicht so praktisch ist. Da hÃ¤tten dem Design ein paar Rundungen nicht geschadet. Im groÃen und Ganzen bin ich mit den Produkt zufrieden.
5,Versand war schnell und Ordentlich.Der KÃ¼hler hat zwar eine ungewÃ¶hnliche Form daran gewÃ¶hnt man sich aber.Macht was er soll jedoch steht mein Laptop nicht mittig auf dem KÃ¼hler da der seitliche KÃ¼hler am Laptop sonst Ã¼ber der kleinen PlastikflÃ¤che hÃ¤ngt und die KÃ¼hlung wenig bringen wÃ¼rde.Er ist soweit leiseaber bei mir wackelt einer der 4 Rotoren nach ein paar Tagen etwas und wenn man keine Musik an hat hÃ¶rt man den schon klackern.Mich stÃ¶rts aber nicht da ich entwecke zocke oder Musik anhabe.FÃ¼r den Preis kann ich ihn empfehlen auch da er eine bessere Leistung bringt als ein KÃ¼hler mit nur 1 groÃen Rotor.Tipp: Holt euch n extra USB Kabel und schlieÃt den KÃ¼hler direkt an die Steckdose an und nicht Ã¼ber den PC.Der zusÃ¤tzliche Stromfluss wÃ¼rde den PC nur weiter erhitzen.
4,Wenn ich Sims 4 spiele wird mein Laptop immer sehr heiÃ weshalb ich mich fÃ¼r dieses Produkt entschieden habe. Bei erster Benutzung fiel mir auf dass meine LÃ¼ftung an der linken Seite platziert ist. Das ist natÃ¼rlich sehr herausfordernd fÃ¼r dieses Produkt. Mein Laptop wird immer noch sehr warm jedoch nicht mehr so unertrÃ¤glich heiÃ wie vor der Nutzung dieses Produktes. Und wÃ¤re die LÃ¼ftung meines Laptops bestimmt woanders wÃ¤re die Leistung bestimmt noch besser als sie jetzt schon war. Zum Ãberleben des Laptops reicht es alle mal!
5,I was going to go with the 3 fan Havit laptop cooler which is highly recommended and actually had it in my basket when I saw the 'others who have purchased this also looked at these' and it caught my eye... took a gamble for Â£1 more and it's massively paid off! I had some cheap eBay rubbish laptop cooler that was ok so when I was gaming on my laptop the other evening when I received this I thought I'd check the CPU and Gpu temps...14 degrees cooler unbelievable. It's well made easy to setup and does its job very very well all the while remaining near on silent highly recommended purchase for anyone looking for a good cheap laptop cooler! Cooler tested on a Dell E6410
5,Unbedingtes Muss fÃ¼r jeden dessen Laptop zu stark aufheizt (z.B. die ACER Aspire neigen dazu). Leicht futuristisches Design aber gute Verarbeitung. Die 4 Rotoren brummen ertragbar vor sich hin die leichte SchrÃ¤ge bei ausgefahrenen StÃ¼tzen ist freundlich zu den Handgelenken. Und auch wenn es keinerlei Funktion hat das KÃ¼hlpad hat "blaues Licht" :-) Was macht das? Es leuchtet blau....
5,Anfangs war ich eher skeptisch ob man fÃ¼r das Geld einen leistungsstarken LÃ¼fter bekommt der hoffentlich nicht zu Laut ist. Aber dieses GerÃ¤t ist spitze.Ich habe ein Asus Zenbook und das wird ziemlich schnell Kochend heiÃ man kann es sich nicht mal auf die Oberschenkel legen. Aber mit dem LÃ¼fter bleibt er richtig KÃ¼hl auch die Performance ist seit dem viel besser!Der LÃ¼fter ist super Verarbeitet man kann die unteren und oberen LÃ¼fter separat Regeln und ausschalten. Der hinteren USB Anschluss erkennt auch sofort meine Kabelgebundene Maus! Und der LÃ¼fter ist wirklich absolut Leise kaum hÃ¶rbar!Meine Erwartungen wurden weit Ã¼bertroffen ein klasse Produkt!
4,Great product the additional USB sockets are very nice. I gaveit 4 stars because the AMNIE cpu vaccum cooler is a more powerful cooling solution. I use both of them together turning off the top two fans on this cooler as the top two fans actually make it difficult for the hot air from the cpu to escape. the combo of the vaccum and this fan cooler reduces hardware temperatures by 25+ degrees C.
4,arrived quickly  packaging was minimalistic and not very wasteful  device is easy to setup and so far has not given me an issues or cause for concern. It has the added bonus/drawback of cooling the user down as much as the laptop due to the draught it creates but overall my laptop has gone from overheating a couple of times a day to never overheating no matter how long it's left on.
5,Very good product i have a 17" Gaming laptop for 3d moddeling and it is very efficient in dispersing heat from the main points of the laptop the built itself is of a good quality plastic and has a good weight to it. The fans are semi-loud but give good ventilation and great heat dispersion. it also has  adjustable fan control for both sides of the pad which is good if you want it to into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE. WHERE THE SUN SHALL FREEZE OUT AS THE FANS OF THIS MIGHTY PAD COOLS IT TO THE CORE it seems portable enough to walk around with in a backpack but i cant answer to be sure. great buy!
2,The quality of the product is quite good for the price. It's solid and very silent. Unfortunately it's not very useful depending on your laptop. In my case Dell XPS 15 L502X I have to do lots of compiling work which make my processor heat up to 90 Â°C when working at full performance (with proper and new silver thermal paste). By using this device alone I could only lower this temperature to 87 Â°C. This makes absolutely no difference and you have to deal with air being constantly blown against your body.I tried also adding an extractor bought to the same brand. In this case the result is a more interesting 83 Â°C. Still too high though. If you expect magic you won't find it with this kind of devices.Summarising: the quality is good but the device used as a standalone solution doesn't do the work and that's the reason of my low rate.
3,Die HÃ¶henverstellung ist NICHT Zweigeteilt wie auch in anderen Rezensionen erwÃ¤hnt.Dies war auch ein RÃ¼cksendegrund da die eine Einstellung eindeutig zu Steil ist fÃ¼r mich. Benutzt man den Abstandhalter nicht sind alle AnsaugÃ¶ffnungen vom Tisch abgedeckt da das KÃ¼hlpad keine seitlichen Ãffnungen besitzt. Die Drehzahlregulierung hÃ¤tte man sich auch sparen kÃ¶nnen da der Einstellbereich viel zu gering ist.Das Pad ist von der LautstÃ¤rke her nur zum Spielen zu empfehlen sonst ist es deutlich lauter als mein Notebook. Die LÃ¼fteranordung dieses Pads ist im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Pads sehr sinnvoll da die meisten Notebooks im vorderen Bereich die Ãffnungen in der Mitte haben und im Hinteren Bereich die KÃ¼hlung an der AuÃenseite benÃ¶tigt wird.Mein ASUS GL771JM kÃ¼hlt das Pad von unten sehr gut wenn man den Abstandhalter benutzt. Jedoch bringt es bei diesem Notebook nichts von unten Frischluft zuzufÃ¼hren. Dies hat aber keinen Einfluss auf meine Bewertung.Fazit: Durchaus empfehlenswertes Pad mit wirklich guter KÃ¼hlleistung fÃ¼r diejenigen die mit dem hohen Abstandhalter zurecht kommen. FÃ¼r mich die bessere Alternative: AVANTEK CP172
4,Seems to work well and fairly quietly. Only criticism is that the small plastic pieces that stop the laptop slipping forward off of it broke off when I moved it. It is still usable just have to be a bit careful when moving it that it doesn't slip off (it is quite slippery with my laptop since it is hard plastic rather than rubbery). However good value for the price.
4,In erster Linie macht das KÃ¼hlpad dass was es tun soll ---- kÃ¼hlen!Der Laptop-Ventilator lÃ¤uft nur noch selten und dann nur langsam.Aaaaber - ich persÃ¶nlich finde dass das wie soll ich sagen LuftstrÃ¶mungsgerÃ¤usch etwas laut ist daher eigentlich 1/2 Stern Abzug.Kann sein dass ich die optimale KÃ¼hlpad-Poti-Einstellung vielleicht nur einfach nochnicht gefunden habe - d.h.: Optimum zwischen Leistung und Wirkung (man kann die vorderen und die hinteren LÃ¼fterpaareseparat regeln bzw. schalten).Dennoch wÃ¼rde ich den KÃ¼hler wieder kaufen.
4,This was delivered very quickly and was very easy to set up and use.  The only reason I didn't award 5 stars was simply that if used on the lap it is not as comfortable and needs padding without blocking vents.. plus the laptop slides easily on its surface.  It is great when used on the table.  I guess it wasn't designed for laps..!?
5,X
5,I am so pleased with this product - I bought a high spec gaming laptop and was alarmed at how much it would heat up. This laptop stand cools the laptop incredibly (around 15 degrees lower than without it) and is also portable. On top of that the fans are pretty quiet - they are fine to use in an office situation or infront of a film without annoying others in the room.You can't turn the lights off but if you go for the 17" laptops like myself you won't be able to see them.
5,Wir haben ein HP 17 Zoll Notebook und hatten zuerst ein Pad mit 3 groÃen LÃ¼ftern probiert. Dieses hatte gar nichts gebracht weil bei HP die grÃ¶Ãte Hitzequelle oben rechts ist und dort so ein dreier Ventilator nicht ran kommt.Ich war auch bei dem Amnie sehr skeptisch muss aber sagen es passt perfekt. Der Laptop steht hier komplett auf dem Pad. Die LÃ¼fter sind ziemlich stark aber nicht sehr laut. die oberen und unteren kann man mittels kleinem Einstellrad auf der RÃ¼ckseite ein- und ausschalten und die IntensitÃ¤t erhÃ¶hen oder mindern.Sind bis jetzt sehr zufrieden und kÃ¶nnen das Coolpad nur empfehlen.
5,My laptop kept crashing when playing games (mainly DOTA2) and temperature of my laptop would stay around 100 degrees celsius throughout the whole time I played a game. My laptop would instantly turn off if it hit 104 degrees which was happening a lot and was really frustrating.Anyway - just got this and it so far seems to help! Most of the game it stuck at around 80 degrees (ended up at 90 after about an hour of gameplay but better than before where it would stay at 100 the whole time).So far would recommend however I've only used it for a couple of hours.
3,Ich habe fÃ¼r meinen anderen Laptop ein KÃ¼hlpad das es aber leider nicht mehr gibt. Das ist so leise daÃ man es kaum hÃ¶rt (bringt aber auch KÃ¼hlung). Allerdings hat das auch nur einen deutlich grÃ¶Ãeren Ventilator.Dieses KÃ¼hlpad ist so laut daÃ ich es wohl nur anschlieÃen werde wenn der Laptop wirklich laut wird beim Selber-KÃ¼hlen. Leider lÃ¤uft der LÃ¼fter meines Laptops ab und an einfach auch im Ruhezustand und das wollte ich hierdurch Ã¤ndern. Nur lÃ¤uft dieses KÃ¼hlpad so laut daÃ der LÃ¼fter des Laptops dagegen ruhig ist.Die blaue Beleuchtung ist ganz witzig aber auf die Dauer stÃ¶rt es wohl eher - vor allen Dingen am Abend wenn die Beleuchtung nicht so hel ist.Das Rad zum HÃ¶her- und Herunterstellen der Leistung des KÃ¼hlpads regelt nur die beiden unteren LÃ¼fter. Der obere LÃ¼fter ist immer an (und blau).Wahrscheinlich werde ich es zurÃ¼ck senden.
4,Keeps my computer lovely and cool. The only problem were the 2 plastic parts at the top front to stop computer sliding off. In the end got fed up continually putting in again Kept coming out but is still good to use...just a bit wary of leaving by edge of table top in case computer slips off onto floor. Otherwise excellent product
4,It's cool being able to turn off and on the fans individually by layer that the wheels to do so are on the back of it is weird you'd have to reach around the laptop. So I have it flipped around.The fans seemingly jam and unjam at random. But it does the job at a decent price.
5,Does the job brilliantly the blue lights are sleek the fans are about the same noise as my laptop internal fan on low given there are four of them it is pretty quiet.You can change the speed of all the fans - two at a time. I have used this to keep my laptop cool while gaming and leaving it on the laptop is actually cold to the touch.Super piece of kit that won't leave you a usb port down as it has one on the front to replace the one you use to power it
3,Wenn dieser KÃ¼hler nicht zufÃ¤llig wirklich kÃ¼hlen wÃ¼rde (173'' Toshiba L70-B-150 steht minimal links oder rechts drÃ¼ber!) dann wÃ¤re er aufgrund der Brumm-GerÃ¤usche wieder Retour gegangen.Es scheint als wÃ¼rden die LÃ¼fter "unrund" laufen und verursachen daher ein Klimaanlagen Ã¤hnlichen Sound dadurch das dieser KÃ¼hler aber regulierbar sind werden (wie in meinem Fall) einfach die hinteren LÃ¼fter runterreguliert und nur die vorderen verwendet. (KÃ¼hlung bleibt erhalten).Die KÃ¼hlung ist so krass dass sogar die Handauflage nicht vom GehÃ¤use und der normalen Hitzeentwicklung warm werden. (Bei Verwendung aller 4 LÃ¼fter).Die Grad-Neigungsverstellungen (Winkel) sind auch sehr gut gelungen. Daher kann das KÃ¼hlpad an sich sehr viel Luft von unten ansaugen.GerÃ¤te Bewertung (Sterne von 0 Sehr schlecht bis 5 Sehr gut)LautstÃ¤rke = 0Tisch und Schoss Verwendung = 2Leistungsabnahme = 3Optik = 4KÃ¼hlung = 5USB Port Erkennung = 5
3,Positiv:-bei Betrieb sehr leise-gute KÃ¼hlung-perfekte GrÃ¶Ãe fÃ¼r mein Acer Aspire R7Negativ:-entgegen der Produktbeschreibung nur EIN Anstellwinkel nicht zwei (also entweder flach auf dem Tisch oder schrÃ¤g angestellt wobei bei einer flachen Lage sicher keine gute KÃ¼hlleistung zu erwarten ist)-eins der beiden EinstellrÃ¤dchen war von Anfang an defekt sodass es im ausgeschalteten Zustand nicht einrastet was aber nicht so schlimm ist da auch kurz vor der Einrastung der LÃ¼fter abgestellt wird und die Raste an dem anderen RÃ¤dchen hÃ¶rt sich ebenfalls so an als ob sie bald den Geist aufgibt werde das mal weiter beobachtenNeutral:-eine kurze Bedienugsanleitung fehlt was aber nicht allzu schlimm ist da es ein einfaches "plug-and-play" system istInsgesamt bin ich mit dem Produkt relativ zufrieden und wÃ¼rde es unter BerÃ¼cksichtigung meiner o.g. MÃ¤ngel durchaus weiter empfehlen!
4,Hab dieses KÃ¼hlpad seit mehreren Monaten im Einsatz bei meinem Gaming Laptop (Mittlerweile dient der Laptop nicht mehr als Gaming Lappi)Leider ist die KÃ¼hlleistung nur geringfÃ¼gig wÃ¤hrend des Zockens ausreichend bei normal Betrieb (Internet Word usw.) jedoch istdie Leistung vollkommen ausreichend.Daher nur fÃ¼r den Ottonormal Verbraucher und nicht fÃ¼r Zocker zu empfehlen.
5,Ich habe mir den KÃ¼hler gekauft da mein Laptop schnell zum Ã¼berhitzen neigt.Ich verlange meinem Laptop meistens relativ viel ab da ich gerne zocke weswegen mein Laptop immer richtig heiÃgelaufen ist.Mit dem KÃ¼hlpad bleibt mein Laptop richtig kalt! Ich hatte nicht mit einem SO guten ergebnis gerechnet. Mein Laptop ist weniger als Lauwarm sogar wenn ich stundenlange zocke.Zum Aussehen brauch man wohl auch nicht mehr viel schreiben. Das Bild zeigt dass das KÃ¼hlpad sehr gut aussieht und die blaue Beleuchtung macht auch richtig was her!Ich kann jedem nur raten sich das KÃ¼hlpad hier zu kaufen!
3,Also Ã¼ber die tadellose Lieferung seitens Amazon brauche ich nun kein Wort mehr verlieren.Ausgepackt und Kabel Ã¼ber den USB-Port angeschlossen und schon war alles in Betrieb.Ich habe ein Monitoringtool runtergeladen um zu kontrollieren ob es wirklich etwas bringt das KÃ¼hlerpad zu nutzen.Je nachdem was ich mache... sind es zwischen 5 und 20 Grad Celsius weniger als ohne das KÃ¼hlerpad.Also Ziel erreicht.Zur GrÃ¶Ãe will ich sagen es passt mein Toshiba Satellite C660 in 156" gerade so noch drauf.FÃ¼r meinen persÃ¶nlichen Geschmack ist das KÃ¼hlerpad nicht tief genug.Was mich persÃ¶nlich aber mega nervt ist der Windzug vorn an der Laptopkante! Hier zieht es ohne Ende.Egal auf welche Geschwindigkeit ich die unteren 2 LÃ¼fter einstelle es wird mir zu kalt an den Handgelenken.
3,In general works ok and fits to my 15" laptop. The temperature decrease only 2-3 degrees if I am using a demanding software. In my opinion the worst things are: 1) The legs of the pad: thin plastic legs that hurt you if you put the pad over your legs when you are in the coach or in the bed  2)Small plastic pieces to hold your laptop: very weak they release extremly easy if you move a bit the pad and all the weight of the laptop is over them.
5,also! alles was in den Rezensionen geschrieben worden ist in allen belangen richtig. nun habe ich keine 2 verschiedene lÃ¼fter mehr die meinen laptop im schrank belÃ¼ften mÃ¼ssen. ausserdem design top - nur schade das dass blaue licht unter dem 15zoller laptop nicht sichtbar ist.aber sau gut ist das ich einige luflÃ¶cher grÃ¶Ãer gemacht habe und unnÃ¼tzige bleche unter dem laptop zur belÃ¼ftung entfernt habe. der 4jahre alte lenovo 3000 ist jetzt von arbeitstemperaturen von 68 - 75 grad runter. die temperaturen sind auf min 26grad max 55grad. wenn die technick durch hÃ¤lt. streicht die 5 * gebe dem ding 10*.  mfg. M.T.
5,Before purchasing the cooling pad my laptop used to cut out all the time (apparently acers are known for it). It became so bad that I just stopped using it. Since using the cooling pad however it has not cut out once.The cooling pad is lightweight surprisingly quiet and really easy to use.Also the spoed of the delivery took me by surprise. And I've just received a mail asking me if everything's ok! How many companies do that?All in all a great product and a fantastic service.
5,This cooler is really different from the others. I had another tecknet one it was actually not bad and satisfying but when I change with this I realized the difference. Suprised about its performance. It especialy comes out when play high graphic games. When I force my laptop it used to go about 90 celcius but with this cooler it stays about 70. Really powerful and can be a real gaming cooler. The only missing thing is there is no on/off button on it only fan speed adjusting wheels. But not very necessary though. Highly recommended.
4,it is a great product however it has started making a faint clicking noise recently but it still cools extremely well and is still very quietEDIT The Clicking noise has gotten worse however amazon are providing me a new one free of charge so i remain with 4*'s
5,Great cooling fan! A few months ago my laptop died on me and I couldn't figure out what the problem was. When I took it to a repair shop they informed me it had overheated. They changed some parts which only made it overheat again only this time it destroyed my Motherboard. After another repair I decided to get this cooling fan and it does an amazing job at the lowest setting! No more heat underneath or anything. Every time I turn on my laptop I always ensure I have this cooling pad connected.
5,Das KÃ¼hlpat ist supergut und erfÃ¼llt alle Erwartungen. Nach 1 Std. Ging mein HP Laptop immer aus. SpÃ¤testens. Das KÃ¼hlboard geht mit Laptop an und automatisch aus. Seit ich es habe....Kein ausgehen mehr. Egal wie lange der Laptop lÃ¤uft. Super leise. HÃ¶re gar nichts. Sehr zufrieden. Ist sein Geld mehr als wert. Kauf ich wieder. Hochstellung hinten ist bombe. Es schreibt sich viel einfacher. Die Ã¤lteren HP's ziehen mehr Strom und werden heiÃ und gehen aus. Es sei denn man kauft dieses KÃ¼hlpad. Einfach klasse..KÃ¼hlpad kaufen statt neuen Laptop. Was will man mehr.
5,Tolles Teil.Nach all der Zeit ist das Ding bei uns immer noch im Einsatz.Alles Tipp Topp.
4,Positiv:-Er ist Leise-Man kann ihn in der HÃ¶he verstellen-Die Ventilatoren lassen sich ein-und auschalten-'Der KÃ¼hler hat noch einen USB Steckplatz freiNegativ:-Der Laptop wird dadurch trotzdem warm.-Mein Laptop obwohl den MaÃen entsprechend muss mann sehr weit nach rechts schieben damit er Ã¼berhaupt was nÃ¼tztFazit:Sehr viele Postive Punkte doch die Hauptaufgabe kann er nicht wirklich gut
4,Die KÃ¼hlerplatte erfÃ¼llt vollkommen ihren Zweck hat mir so machen warmen Sommertag das Spielen gesichert.Kabel hat jedoch nach 15 Jahren den Geist aufgegeben was vollkommen legitim ist.Nutze die KÃ¼hlerplatte heute noch nach knapp 3 Jahren. Musste mir nur einmal ein neues Kabel holen.
4,Erstmal ein paar positive Punkte:- Der Laptop (154 Zoll) Steht gut und sicher auf den LÃ¼ftern- Die KÃ¼hlleistung ist herrausragend- Er sieht mit dem Blauen Licht gut ausEinziges negative er ist recht Laut nicht das es wirklich StÃ¶rt aber doch um einiges Lauter als der Laptop selbnst je war
5,FÃ¼r die KÃ¤lte die dieses GerÃ¤t  erzeugen kann erstaunlich ruhig hatte schon andere die hÃ¶rten sich bei Voller IntensitÃ¤t an wie ein Vibrator. Wenn man es auf dem schoss hat wird einem auch richtig kalt und ich benutze HauptsÃ¤chlich die oberen beiden KÃ¼hler  sehr praktisch im Sommer!!Einfach zu bedienen.Ein schalter fÃ¼r die oberen beiden und ein fÃ¼r die unteren beiden. Laptop wird trotzdem noch "warm" aber das Pad hilft deutlich und fÃ¼r mich klare Kaufempfehlung fÃ¼r den Preis. WÃ¼rde ich wieder kaufen.
4,Brilliant for the first couple of weeks.. does a decent job of cooling laptops however it began making lots noise .not sure if it's normal but it wakes family up at night. Sounds like a gaming desktop which is quite loud.
4,ErfÃ¼llt den Zweck und kÃ¼hlt um einige Grad runter.Merkbar bei Langzeitnutzung des Laptops im Vergleich ohne KÃ¼hlpad und mit.FÃ¼r meinen 17'' Lappy ist die Form des Pads nicht ideal 1' weniger und dann passt das perfekt.Empfehlung: Bis 16''Nebeneffekt: Sieht gut aus.
5,It works perfectly as described even without the fan on it helps keep the laptop cool. I found it very good for keeping the laptop off of the desk where things could be spilled as well. The biggest difference i have noticed is that it keeps the laptop a lot cooler when it is resting on fabric such as a duvet where the fans would normally be blocked. Great product nice and quiet and has enough power for what i use it for.
4,Ich hab nichts auszusetzen.Leicht zu bedienen macht kaum GerÃ¤usche und fÃ¤llt nicht auf. Super ist der ergonomische Zusatz. Anmerken sollte man dass beim hochheben des Laptops plus kÃ¼hler die Finger nicht unbedingt unter den Ventilatoren sein sollten da man sonst die RotorblÃ¤tter berÃ¼hren und sich weh tun kann. Ansonsten ein super Produkt mit klasse Preis/LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis.
2,Da mein Notebook 156 Zoll in die Jahre gekommen ist und es sich ohne Last nun schon im Sommer von allein abschaltet wegen Ãberhitzung habe ich mir voller Erwartung und Optimismus dieses KÃ¼hlpad bestellt. Lieferung war sehr schnell und es war gut verpackt. Nun denn. Bei ca. 28Â° C Zimmertemperatur Notebook und KÃ¼hlpad unten drunter eingeschaltet. Vorerst alles ganz in Ordnung. An bekannten Stellen wurde es dennoch sehr heiÃ. Im Stresstest mit einem Ã¤lteren Spiel welches noch lief als das Notebook noch neu war versagte die Kombination aus NB und KÃ¼hlpad. Wahrscheinlich habe ich zu viel erwartet und mein NB ist schon zu alt. Ist es fÃ¼r meine Begriffe zwar nicht mit seinen i5 - Herz aber nun gut. Ich muss mich nun zwischen zwei und drei Sternen entscheiden. Einen gibt es fÃ¼r die schnelle Lieferung und gute Verpackung und einen fÃ¼r die schÃ¶ne Optik. Momentan weiÃ ich leider noch nicht  wofÃ¼r ich den dritten Stern vergeben kÃ¶nnte. Vielleicht fÃ¤llt mir zukÃ¼nftig noch etwas dazu ein?
4,Does the job keeps my laptop cool the 4 fans do make a little noise but that's a small price to pay to keep the laptop or notebook or any device that's able to be put onto it and keep it cool
3,"Unsichtbar" ist dieser KÃ¼hler eindeutig nicht. Er hÃ¤lt schon einige Zeit und tut seinen Dienst ist aber vergleichsweise laut (stÃ¶rt bei Telefonkonferenzen) und kÃ¼hlt nur in moderatem MaÃ.
4,Cools my gaming laptop perfectly. It is a bit light and flimsy the materials used could have been of better quality. Apart from that good product. A shame they screwed up the delivery but I got it in the end.
5,... das die bezeichnung bester laptop-kÃ¼hlpad etwas Ã¼bertrieben sei. nun es hat sich herausgestellt dass es fÃ¼r meinen lappi genau das richtige war. ich nutze zur zeit ein akoya 17" . gerade bei den hitzewellen in der letzten zeit dachte ich nicht dass der kÃ¼hler diese kÃ¼hlleistung schaffen kann. aber mut zum risiko dachte ich mir und bestellte das ding. aber das beste an der ganzen sache: es kÃ¼hlt nicht nur den lappi sondern auch meine hÃ¤nde und etwas meinen kopf der der hitze das beste was ich mir vorstellen kann ;o)deswegen hier meine kaufempfehlung!
5,Die LÃ¼fter sind absolut leise das Design ist spitze und macht durch die blauen LEDs viel her. Zu dem gibt es einen weiteren USB-Eingang weshalb man also am Lap-Top keinen verliert. Die KÃ¼hlung ist auch top und dadurch dass man die FÃ¼Ãe anheben kann und den Lap-Top darauf befestigen kann kann man diese Unterlage auch in mehreren Situationen sehr gut verwenden. Die LÃ¼fter (vorne und hinten) sind je Stufenlos einstellbar. Auch wenn man sie voll aufdreht hÃ¶rt man kaum auch nur irgendwas. Da ist der LÃ¼fter vom Lap-Top deutlich lauter (bei mir jedenfalls)
4,Das KÃ¼hlpad ist echt super. FÃ¼r die GrÃ¶Ãe bzw. die 4 Ventilatoren ist es Ã¼berraschend leise.Ich bin sehr zufrieden und wÃ¼rde es mir immer wieder kaufen.1 Stern Abzug gibt es wegen dem Material es ist nur aus Plastik und die Ãffnungen sind etwas groÃ.Ansonsten empfehlenswert :)
5,Bei der Auswahl eines KÃ¼hlpads bin ich unter anderem von Kundenrezensionen ausgegangen. War eigentlich skeptisch. Doch der Artkel hat mich Ã¼berzeugt. Die GerÃ¤usche sind so gering man nimmt sie gar nicht wahr.Auch das blaue Licht stÃ¶rt nicht. Die Verarbeitung ist auch ok. Zwar steht das Laptop rechts und links ca. 4 cm Ã¼ber - tut aber dem Gebrauch keinen Abbruch. Es steht sicher  auf dem KÃ¼hlpad !Die Lieferung war wieder "topp" - nach dem Motto: Heute bestellt - morgen geliefert.
1,Die fehlende Funktion der Geschwindigkeits-Drehregler spielt gegenÃ¼ber der folgenden Probleme keine Rolle mehr.ZunÃ¤chst machte der KÃ¼hler einen angenehm kÃ¼hlen GerÃ¤teboden am  DELL Latitude E6530 mit Core i7 3740QM.Quad Core  (und LÃ¼ftungsÃ¶ffnungen am Boden).Jedoch zeigte sich mit dem "open hardware monitor" (freeware)  keine meÃbare KÃ¼hlwirkung an GPU GF117 (nvidia NVS 5200)  und CPU (105Â°; Rechner taktete dann von 35 GHz  um ca 1 GHz runter) .Dies ist insbesondere deshalb gefÃ¤hrlich da sich zwar die CPU durch Heruntertakten schÃ¼tzen kann der User dann jedoch im Vertrauen auf effektive KÃ¼hlwirkung bei lÃ¤ngerer Vollast die Elektrolytkondensatoren in der NÃ¤he der Prozessoren auf dem Mainboard einer schnelleren Alterung aussetzt. Selbst wenn hochwertige 125Â°-Elkos verbaut sind so geben die Hersteller in der Regel bei Nenntemperatur nur 1000 bis 2000 Stunden Lebensdauer an. Das sind gerade mal 125 bis 250 Arbeitstage!!  Bei je 10Â° weniger verdoppelt sich die zu erwartende Lebensdauer. Bei 105Â° sind das auch nur 4000 bis 8000 Stunden. Jedoch bei  85Â° sind das dann schon 15 Jahre.  KÃ¼hlen lohnt sich also aber nur wenn's auch funktioniert.Das KÃ¼hlpad wurde zurÃ¼ckgesandt.Tipp: absaugenden Systeme da hier der Luftstrom Ã¼ber die Heatpipes direkt mit den Prozessoren in Verbindung steht.
5,Der LÃ¼fter kÃ¼hlt mein Notebook bis zu 15 Grad  runter als beim normalen Betrieb. Man kann die LÃ¼fter paarweise steuern somit hat man die MÃ¶glichkeit je nach WÃ¤rmequelle die anzupassen. Maximal wÃ¼rde ich ihn wirklich nur bis 17" benutzen fÃ¼r die 18" Notebooks ist er zu klein.Beim maximalen Umdrehungen ist der zwar laut aber nicht lauter als mein Notebook wenn er richtig aufdreht.Nach 2 Wochen kann ich nur sagen: Kaufen.P.S. Er sieht auch noch gut aus. :) Aber bei den inneren Werten ist das zweitrangig!
5,Ich wollte mein Gaming-Laptop von Temperaturen um 90Â°C wegbekommen und habe mir dieses Laptop-KÃ¼hlpad gekauft. Das Produkt ist stabil nicht zu wakelig und hat auch problemlos meinen etwas schwereren Laptop ausgehalten.Die LÃ¼ftersteuerung Ã¼ber zwei Potis funktioniert einwandfrei. AuÃer kalten HÃ¤nden hat mir dieses KÃ¼hlpad leider nichts gebracht. Ich konnte weder bei Spielen noch bei Benchmarks irgendeine VerÃ¤nderung der Temperatur erkennen.Das bedeutet allerdings nicht das dieses Produkt generell unbrauchbar ist verschiedene Laptops haben verschiedene Eigenschaften daher funktioniert es bei manchen bei anderen nicht !
5,Habe diesen KÃ¼hler bestellt weil mein Laptop bei 92 Grad fast den Hitzetot erlegen ist.Der KÃ¼hler hat es mit seinen 2 unabhÃ¤ngig geschalteten Doppelventilatoren geschafft den PC um bis zu 20-40 Grad runterzukÃ¼hlen abhÃ¤ngig von der Anwendung am PC. Nutze ihn Ã¼brigens fÃ¼r einen 184 Zoll Laptop.Die vorderen und die hinteren Ventilatoren lassen sich getrennt mit einem Drehregler stufenlos regulieren.Die Ventilatoren sind wie versprochen super leise.ZusÃ¤tzlich gibt es noch einen zusÃ¤tzlichen USB Port den ich aber nicht benutze.Kann den KÃ¼hler uneingeschrÃ¤nkt empfehlen.
3,I have a MacBook Pro 13".. I play WoW so I needed something to cool down my laptop because was overheating way to fast!I needed something fast so I ordered this after reading reviews.  I am happy with this for now but it isn't that great!  I will be getting something better but for mean time it's not bad.
3,Das Produkt ist ziemlich mittelmÃ¤Ãig. Es kÃ¼hlt schon aber die KÃ¼hlung reicht nur aus wenn man ganz normale Dinge am PC macht. Wenn ich am PC zocke oder sonstiges mit erhÃ¶hter Leistung mache hÃ¤lt das KÃ¼hlpad nicht immer mit. Es wird auf Dauer selbst manchmal richtig warm. Aber mehr kann man wie gesagt auch nicht erwarten.Das mitgelieferte Kabel ist meiner Meinung nach auch etwas zu kurz. Der KÃ¼hler ist vom GerÃ¤uschpegel auch etwas laut. Das blaue Licht stÃ¶rt mich hingegen nicht es fÃ¤llt kaum auf. Alles in allem 3 Sterne.
3,As a stand this is beautiful and effective. As a laptop cooler it is quiet but it doesn't seem to be cooling my laptop down by a very small amount (1-2 degrees tops). I'm using a macbook pro retina 2012 model with a moshi clearguard case in clamshell mode. The usb port for the cooling pad is plugged directly into a powerpoint (as opposed to the macbook).
5,My laptop is used literally as a computer I place atop my lap to browse the internet for gaming work etc. It works up quite a bit of heat and was pretty much roasting my nuts. Placing this under the laptop with the USB power cable is just the job. Cools down the whole area and actually does cool the laptop rather than just being a heat barrier. Would totally recommend.
4,The Fans work very well and all. However... It is described as 'ultra quiet fans' on the box but the fans are quite loud compared to the built in laptop fans.
5,This is one of the best purchases Iv ever made.My gaming laptop is prone for over heating a lot but with this Cooling pad I can play for hours without any hiccups.You can adjust the speed and the fans glow blue so under the laptop it has a carpet of blue haze.If it ever brakes I will defo buy another the same well worth every penny.
4,It's helped to keep my laptop nice and cool.However the stands at the back are fixed in place as in they can't be adjusted to a custom height so keep this in mind.
5,Great Item works very well nice and quiet. The flat design is ideal for any games console ( most other laptop coolers have a degree of tilt on them as standard what can cause unwanted lazer burn on games/damage ) Keeps your device cooler for longer alowing a longer gaming/usage periiod and less long term head related damage. I recommend this product to all Playstation/Xbox Gamers XD
5,Great bit of kit much better than another cooling pad I had this is a powerful bit of kit and it looks very good. I use it on an 18 inch laptop and although not technically big enough it has and is doing a great job . You can actually feel the fans working and i really do feel that this has made a big differnce to the laptop.
5,Das Produkt ist einwandfrei.Schneller Versand wie bei Amazon Ã¼blich.Das Produkt selbst kommt in einer sehr Frust freien Verpackung und ist im Handumdrehen installiert.Ich habe den LÃ¼fter seit dem Kauf gut und gerne 5 Stunden am Tag laufen.Er stÃ¶rt nicht in der LautstÃ¤rke oder von der HÃ¶he.Der einzige Nachteil ist das man das Licht nicht separat aus bzw ein schalten kann.Von mir 5* ein sehr tolles Produkt
4,Das Pad ist recht robust und sorgt fÃ¼r KÃ¼hlung an heiÃen Tagen.einziger Kritikpunkt sind die die ausklappbaren FÃ¼Ãe zum aufstellen und die die verhindern sollen dass das Notebook vom Pad rutscht sind sind leider nicht so stabil
5,Ein LaptopkÃ¼hler der von mir manchmal ausgeschalten werden muss weil mir kalt wird :DSpaÃ bei Seite. Mein Alienware M15 wird von diesem Leistungsstarken Laptop-KÃ¼hler non stop bearbeitet ohne dass er von seinem LÃ¤rmpegel her auffÃ¤llt. Er ist doch sehr leise und extrem gut! Das mitgelieferte Kabel (UsB zu USB) macht auch einen guten Eindruck und ich hatte bisher keine Probleme.Die hinteren Propeller lassen sich unabhÃ¤ngig von den vorderen stufenlos in der StÃ¤rke einstellen bzw. ausstellen!Klare Kaufempfehlung!
4,Sehr gutes KÃ¼hlpad wirkt leistungssteigernd bei hohem Datenverbrauch leider um einiges lauter als mein Laptop.
4,Works well and easy to install.  Good price and prompt delivery
4,Habe Ã¤lteres Notebook dass bei Spielen ganz gut blÃ¤st und hin und wieder bei zu hoher Belastung abgeschaltet hat.Seit ich das KÃ¼hlpad verwende wird der Prozessor nicht mehr so heiÃ und das Notebook schaltet auch nicht mehr ab.
4,Bin vorerst zufrieden mit dem KÃ¼hlerpad.Was er bringt ist wohl erst im Sommer zu beurteilen.Ein Rauschen jastÃ¶rt mich aber nicht.Wer die Maus-Hand vor dem Laptop hat spÃ¼rt natÃ¼rlich die kÃ¼hle Luft.Meine Maus-Hand liegt daneben also auch kein Problem.LÃ¼fter lassen sich auch regulieren oder abschalten-paarweise.
4,Permet de baisser la tempÃ©rature du PC pas silencieux mais pas trÃ¨s bruyant.
5,It is by far the best cooling pad I ever had. Switched from Zalman NC-2500 and the difference is HUGE! This pad easily cools down by 10C I get 70-75C in games with overclocked GT650M video card. It fits my Dell Inspiron 17 very nicely is very quite and looks cool. I definitely recommend this product to anyone! It blows away the others by miles!
5,Ich habe ein Gaming Notebook mit einer GTX780M Grafikkarte.Und natÃ¼rlich nutze ich mir die zur VerfÃ¼gung stehenden Grafikresourcen auch voll aus.Zeitweise ist sind dann die LÃ¼fter des Notebooks so laut geworden dass man sie 10m Entfernung hÃ¶hren konnte.Jetzt hab ich das Notebook auf dieses KÃ¼hlpad gestellt LÃ¼fter des Pads auf niedriegste Stufe.Und was soll ich groÃ sagen?Nu ist Ruhe im Karton.Geht doch...!
5,This has to be my best purchase of the year so far I love gaming on my laptop but was worried by the heat being generated problem solved! I also love the way it stands the laptop at a very convenient angle for working. An absolute marvel I cannot say enough good things about this brilliant piece of kit.
5,Great product. Lowered the operating temperature on my laptop whilst gaming by a solid 10--15 degrees C. When it's tilted up on the legs the fans sometimes make a quiet little click --- I guess they rub on the side when that happens --- but it's barely noticeable. Cheap does the job is nice and quiet. Great piece of kit.
5,Ok so I use this under my passively cooled (mostly) Ho aliminium shell laptop...Which means it can get up to 59c on the outside..This fan tray keeps everything cool... And with an awesome blue light.My rough calculations supports the air flow volume too higher than some more expensive versions I might add.
5,Basically silent. My elderly Macbook Pro gets hot these days and this has been the perfect solution. The "gamer" look doesn't look out of place in the office two sets of fans are variable and you don't lose any USB ports as there's a replacement port on the unit. It keeps my laptop stone cold.Would totally recommend.
5,Hatte immer das Problem das sich mein Laptop  Typ ACER ASPIRE 7738G 173" nach lÃ¤ngeren Gebrauch sich Abschaltete wurde zu HeiÃ.Mit dem AMNIE AE-CP 1501 156" ist dies nicht mehr.Auch fÃ¼r den 173" Laptop ist dies genau die richtige GrÃ¶Ãe Sehr Angenehm leise die LÃ¼fter auch die EinstellmÃ¶glichkeiten des KÃ¼hlpad sindsehr Angenehm.Alles in allem ein Grund sich solch ein Teil zu Kaufen eine echte Empfehlung !!!
5,Sehr gute Notebook-KÃ¼hler!!!Beim Normalen Arbeit: GPU1  -10Â°C GPU2 -10Â°C und CPU -11Â°CBeim GPU Stress FurMark: GPU1 -20Â°C GPU2 -15Â°C und CPU -15Â°CBeim Spielen (Witcher 3): GPU1 -10Â°C und CPU -7-8Â°C  (GTA V): GPU1 -15-20Â°C und CPU -8Â°CAlso ziemlich gute KÃ¼hlung. Leider wird CPU weniger gekÃ¼hlt als GPU aber trotzdem gut.Negativ: bisschen laut.Wichtig: Alle Testergebnisse sind mit zweiten HÃ¶heneinstellung!!!
4,Good Product that does what I bought it for except the adjustable height.There 2 height settings? ok but 1 is flat.
5,Does all that it says on the box!. Keeps laptop very cool and the addition of a spare usb socket is useful. The only drawback I have found is that if plugged into a usb extender it takes a lot of power away from the other usb sockets. This certainly a good item and I would recommend it.
4,Decent enough fan. Use it for my ps4. Not particularly loud. But you will hear it over your Ps4 definitely.
4,Nach upgrad10 fuhr der Laptop stÃ¤ndig runter da der Akku extrem warm wurde.Jetzt nicht mehr dank der variabel schaltbaren LÃ¼fterAllerdings sollte man was warmes anziehen wenn man davor sitzt es ziehtnÃ¤mlich ganz schÃ¶n
5,refroidisseur qui fait vraiment son travail. il accueille facilement un ordi de 15 pouces. aucun problÃ¨me pour que l'ordi reste en place et ne glisse. possibilitÃ© de faire fonctionner que 2 ventilos ou les 4 et de rÃ©gler leur puissance.tres content de mon achat
5,Really nice cooling fun that can never let you laptop overheat.I have an HP laptop and always had overheating problems (it is common on HP laptops) This is a perfect product as in contrast with others the 4 fans make sure that no spot will be missed.I highly recommend it!
5,Sehr gute QualitÃ¤t. Macht das was es soll und zwar besser als gedacht.Es ist einfach zu bedienen.Es sind zwei drehregler vorhanden einer fÃ¼r die oberen und einer fÃ¼r die unteren beiden LÃ¼fter. Laptop wird trotzdem noch "warm" aber das Pad hilft deutlich und fÃ¼r mich klare Kaufempfehlung fÃ¼r den Preis. WÃ¼rde ich wieder kaufen.
5,One of the most useful purchases I've made. My MacBook Pro 13" would get really hot if I was playing a game or editing videos. This product was a life saver and keeps it extremely cool. I never placed the laptop on my lap until I bought this product.
4,My venerable laptop needed to cool down and this product does the job.
3,Das KÃ¼hlpad ist gut verarbeitet und kÃ¼hlt meinen Laptop auch merkbar. Bisher das beste KÃ¼hlpad das ich habe und ich habe bereits viele ausprobiert. Jedoch muss ich sagen dass mein Laptop bei lÃ¤ngerem Gaming trotzdem ausgeht weil er Ã¼berhitzt. Dies passiert aber viel spÃ¤ter als ohne das KÃ¼hlpad. Nach einiger Benutzung fÃ¤ngt ein KÃ¼hlerlicht an zu flackern und ich spekuliere wann es ganz "ausbrennen" und aus gehen wird.
5,Does what it needs to perfectlyBonus: keeps my hands cool in summerdownside if you turn on the bottom fan the air can make your hands a  lil cold in winter but beside that its perfecttttttttttt I usualy just turn on the upper fan/back ones anyways :D
5,Der KÃ¼hler hat meine Erwartungen absolut Ã¼bertroffen! Er kÃ¼hlt den Laptop - vorher ~90Â°C heiÃ - auf etwa ~70Â°C unter Last herunter. Endlich kann ich damit wieder Videos gucken ohne dass mir der Rechner abschmiert.Die Verarbeitung ist gut: Nichts knackt und knarzt alles hÃ¤lt. Die LautstÃ¤rke ist in Ordnung da gewÃ¶hnt man sich dran. 4 LÃ¼fter auf voller Last machen eben ein GerÃ¤usch.
5,Does the job and is very quiet i thought with so many fans noise would be a distraction but nope. Both sons { gamers } have 1 so that is the proof how good they are. Highly recommend and great price. Plus the bright blue lighting is good looking.
5,Das Pad erfÃ¼llt seinen Zweck genial. Es kÃ¼hlt hervorragend mein Laptop. Die stylische Beleuchtung ist ein schÃ¶ner Blickfang. Es ist sehr leise und auch bei Akkulauf nicht zu verbrauchsarg. WÃ¼rde es jederzeit wieder kaufen.
5,Works great. Laptop is nice and cool now. There was a hot spot on my laptop and my old cooler never dealt with it but it's gone now :)Nice and quiet and the lead is a decent size too. I have a 17" laptop and it fits perfectly.
5,I use this with my laptop every day for work. My laptop kept shutting down as it was overheating. Since I got the cooling pad there have not been any annoying shutdowns so it must be doing the trick! It runs very quietly.
4,Cheapcheerful. Does what it does. Very quiet and nice to look atGreat product.
5,This was delivered very quickly it was well packaged however the corner of the pad was chipped not that it affected it's use. The pad works very well to keep the lap top cool even when left on for many hours. The fans are  quiet as well.
5,Bei starker Beanspruchung bleibt das lapi  cool. An den vergangenen heiÃen Tagen reichte die ZusÃ¤tzlich KÃ¼hlung den CPU unter 40Â°C zu halten. Eine kÃ¼hle Brise sorgte sogar fÃ¼r eine Erleichterung fÃ¼r mich. Wenn die Raumtemp. wieder gemÃ¤Ãigter ist kann man ein 2 LÃ¼fter ausschalten.
5,Mir war es wichtig das das KÃ¼hlpad recht dÃ¼nn ist um es in die Amazon Notebooktasche zu bekommen (17").. passt wunderbar !Das Usb-Kabel lÃ¤sst sich clever auf der rÃ¼ckseite des Pad's verstecken was ich sehr nÃ¼tzlich finde .Zur Leistung:  - Sehr effizient ! GameNotebook kommt nicht Ã¼ber 65Â°C bei voller Leistung
5,Perfectly! I already have a stand for a month and I have never seen such a good cooling. Low power consumption low noise windmills. Fits up to my 14 inch netbooka.Nareszcie I can without fear put your computer on the bed without fear that it overheats.
4,Wie in Beschreibung. Kann man ohne Probleme weiterempfehlen.Brummt leider etwas. Ist aber zu verkraften. KÃ¼hlleistung gut.1-2 mehr USB AnschlÃ¼sse auf der RÃ¼ckseite wÃ¤ren toll gewesen.
4,Das zusÃ¤tzlich KÃ¼hlgerÃ¤t ist recht gut in der leistung  im Hochsommer muss es sich erst noch beweisen !!Mehr kann ich im Moment noch nicht sagen.
5,I bought this because my laptop would overheat and shut down a lot. Since using the fan this hasn't been an issue at all. My laptop is about an inch biggger than the recommend size but still fits roughly ok. It looks good too!
5,great product.. does exactly what it says on the tin lol .. bit noisy but has dramatically reduce the temperature of my laptop.. ive only had this product for two weeks now so hoping it does last me a long time
5,Da ich hÃ¤ufiger Spiele auf meinem Laptop spiele und dieser dadurch immer wirklich heiÃ wird brauchte ich dringend ein Coolpad und hab dieses hier gefunden.Kann nur sagen dass es wirklich super gut ist und kann es nur weiter empfehlen.
5,Bought this because my HP laptop tends to run hot since a Win10 re-install (even after stripping it and cleaning all the heat-sinks!). Cools the laptop very well with a noticeable drop in core temperatures. Now runs games and VirtualBox environments with no heat problems.
5,Der KÃ¼hler kam an und habe Ihn direkt in beschlag genommen.Verpackung Normaler Karton.Inhalt KÃ¼hler und USB geflochtenes Kabel.Angeschlossen auf volle Zahl und er ist Bombe. Nur zu Empfehlen.Die Blauen LÃ¼fter leuchten Blau und sehen gut aus.Kann ich nur Empfehlen
5,Freitag bestellt Samstag war es da :)Ich hatte das Problem das mein Laptop als Heizungsersatz dienen konnte wenn ich gezockt hatte!Habe mir zuerst eine LÃ¶sung selbst gebaut aus BÃ¼chern und einem USB-Ventilator was enicht wirklich geholfen hatte.Durch den KÃ¼hler bleibt man Laptop angenehm kÃ¼hl und ich kann endlich wieder normal ohne Gamefreezes zocken :)
5,Good quality and really cools down my laptop as it gets really hot when playing games on it.
5,Nach erfolglosem Versuch eine leise KÃ¼hlung fÃ¼r den Laptop zu finden bin ich hier gelandet.Der KÃ¼hler ist leise und lÃ¤sst sich stufenlos einstellen. Bei mir reicht die niedrigste Einstellung vollstÃ¤ndig aus.Der GerÃ¤uschpegel entspricht dann dem KÃ¼hler im Laptop wenn er ohne Belastung lÃ¤uft.Das war mein Ziel. Ich bin mit dem KÃ¼hler sehr zufrieden.
4,Der Computer hat sich seit dem Kauf des KÃ¼hlpads nicht mehr Ã¼berhitzt. Konstruktion (ausklappbare FÃ¼Ãe) ist ein bisschen windig aber ok... LÃ¤uft relativ leise und bis jetzt ohne AnfÃ¤lligkeiten.
5,Habe den KÃ¼hler nun ca 3 Wochen und bin sehr zufrieden damit. Mein 7 Jahre alter Laptop lÃ¤uft nun wieder rund. WÃ¤rmeleitpaste erneuert und den KÃ¼hler dazu und nun sind die CPU Werte wieder in grÃ¼nen :-)Mal sehen wie sich der KÃ¼hler auf lange Zeit verhÃ¤lt bisher sehr zufrieden.
4,works good
5,This device was quite helpful. It can make a difference and reduce the idle temperature of my laptot when I'm watching films or playing. I would recommend it. Besides you should clean you laptop fan once a year.
2,After just 5 months of using this product one of the fans just stopped working. I'm really disappointed because it looked good on the first sight. I couldn't find any difference with or without the cooling pad in terms of my laptop temperature + the fans are too loud. Definitely not recommending it. Giving it only 2 stars for surviving 5 months.
5,habe  den LÃ¼fter unter mein Laptop  gestellt  LÃ¼fter sind stufenlos  regelbar  laufen  sehr leise  100 %  Empfehlung  von mir
5,Der LaptopkÃ¼hler ist super. Er kÃ¼hlt gut ist dabei leise ist gÃ¼nstig und sieht auch noch gut aus. Er ist stabil und einfach zu transportieren passt z. B. problemlos mit in die Laptoptasche. Die Lieferung erfolgte superpÃ¼nktlich und es war alles gut verpackt. Ich wÃ¼rde ihn jederzeit wieder kaufen.
4,Its not bad. The fans are strong enough. but definitely NOT quiet
5,Ich habe dieses KÃ¼hlpad gekauft weil sich mein Laptop hÃ¤ufig Ã¼ber eine Temperatur von 80Â°C aufheizte jetzt geht die Temperatur nur noch bismaximal 65Â°C hoch die 140er LÃ¼fter laufen leise und sind regelbar was will man mehr?^^Das Preis-Leistungs--VerhÃ¤ltnis finde ich in Ordnung.Ich wÃ¼rde dieses Produkt jederzeit weiter empfehlen :)
4,Very good and looks the part too.
4,Works fine
3,kann nichts negatives finden auÃer das das kabel welches verwendet wird um das KÃ¼hlpad mit dem Laptop zu verbinden schon nach kurzer Zeit einen Wackelkontakt bekam da es sich dabei um keine gute QualitÃ¤t handelt
4,Es ist ein guter KÃ¼hler leise und stabil. Allerdings kÃ¶nnte ruhig etwas stÃ¤rker seien auch wenn das nicht so schlimm ist
5,I've had this fan for 4 days now and so far I think it's great.  It's really quiet and keeps my laptop really cool. Fingers cross it doesn't break too soon as some of the reviews have stated.
4,Great product but can be a little loud at times.
5,I have now had this item for several days and it is really good it provides more than enough cooling is silent when running and looks good.  Well worth buying an improvement on several others I have used.
5,Ich habe bereits einige dieser KÃ¼hlungen ausprobiert und stets hatte es eine Schwachstelle: das Kabel das grundsÃ¤tzlich nach einem halben Jahr durchgebrochen ist. Das kann hier allerdings nicht passieren da das Kabel mit Stoff ummantelt ist. auÃerdem ist er sehr leistungsstark und ausgesprochen leise im Gegensatz zu meinen 2 alten.
5,Ist leise und hÃ¤lt was er verspricht
4,Good product.  Does the job perfectly.
5,this is certanley of the better coolers out there it dropped the temperature readingon one occaision by 10degrees it normaly drops it by 7degrees so more than up tothe job can recommend to all.
5,Been using this for about 8 months and its fantastic. Can't knock it. Does what it's suppose to do. Clean tidy designbans the blue is just a lovely touch. Definately recommend it.
5,An excellent piece of kit. Dirt cheap and has reduced the heat coming off my laptop by about 60%.My only complaint is it took 3 days to arrive despite being prime.
5,FANTASTIC! Without any doubt this is THE BEST laptop cooler I have ever owned! It's very well made and with multiple USB inputs it's way ahead of anything else on the market.
4,Best cooling pad tried
5,Sehr angenehm und einfach in der Bedienung. Stecker rein zwei oder alle vier ventilatoren an und der laptop (und ggf man selbst ein wenig) wird gut gekÃ¼hlt. Stufenlose VentilatorstÃ¤rke und angenehmes Licht. Top
4,does the job well very good value i reccomend this.
5,this absolute cooling pad realy does cool my laptop down like it has not been switch on and so quiet its a pity i had not thought about it before brilliant
3,Ich hatte diese KÃ¼hlpad fÃ¼r meinen Kollegen gekauft weswegen ich nicht genau sagen kann ob sie nun gut sind oder nicht bisher gab es aber keine Beschwerde weswegen ich annehme das es gut ist.
3,Works well enough but drains Battery if you have fan on constant and have any other Usb device attached to it
5,Great item laptop overheated and slowed down (Cool Temp app measured at 102 degrees) until I got this cooler now never goes above 87 degrees. Very pleased. Delivery very quick.
2,Having bought this to cool my laptop down it worked well for about 4 hours until the rear fans decided they wanted to stop working. Will be contacting Amazon to return this and purchase a different brand. Its a shame because I really liked the look of the item and the LED's were a plus.
5,As the old TV commercial states "Does exactly what it says on the tin".  Quiet and efficient keeps the laptop cool and stops it overheating in silly times.Recommended to anyone.
5,- Der LÃ¼fter ist sehr laufruhig- leistet eine durchgehend gute KÃ¼hlung- Es kÃ¶nnen sowohl die zwei hinteren oder die zwei vorderen RotorblÃ¤tter einzeln betrieben werden- Rotoren stÃ¤rke / -geschwindigkeit kÃ¶nnen stufenlos eingestellt werden (auch bei hÃ¶chster Leistung noch sehr Laufruhig)
5,Ich habe mir diesen KÃ¼hler gekauft da mein Laptop sehr oft sehr heiÃ ist und dann ausgeht. Seit dem ich diesen KÃ¼hler habe gIng mein Laptop kein einziges mal aus . Ich finde der KÃ¼hler ist extrem gut und lohnt sich fÃ¼r den preis  !
5,Silent uses one USB port but gives you three in return ideal for working on cloth surfaces and really keeps the laptop cool as its meant to be
5,Very well made and very stable. I use a dell 17" laptop and it fitted perfectly.  Variably fan output too. Very good and recommended.
3,Its a great device for cooling but the laptop is not stable on the pad and keeps slipping about
5,ich kann mich bis jetz nicht beschweren der kÃ¼hlpad tut was er soll.mein laptop wird gut gekÃ¼hlt u laut ist er auch nicht.schade nur mein altes pad hatte sich nach einiger zeit nicht benutzen mit dem laptop ausgeschaltet aber das ist fÃ¼r mich kein minuspunkt.
2,Das Produkt macht einen soliden Eindruckt Stromversorgungskabel (USB) zusÃ¤tzlich isoliert. Stabiler Halt des Laptops auf der Auflage. Die KÃ¼hlung funktioniert auch und ist bei meinem I7 deutlich zu spÃ¼ren - Handauflage ist nicht mehr warm - spÃ¼rbare KÃ¼hlung.ABER: das Teil ist genau so laut wie der CPU LÃ¼fter im Laptop bei erhÃ¶hter LÃ¼ftung. Folglich macht das ganze Null Sinn. GrundsÃ¤tzlich guter LÃ¼fter aber die LautsstÃ¤rke ist ein absolutes Ausschlusskriterium - geht gleich wieder zurÃ¼ck.
5,fits perfectly my 15" laptop it does the job very well. very good quality it's running nice and quiet keeps my laptop cool I'm very pleased
4,great does what it says on the tin!
5,Very useful. The fans are ultra quiet and the slope allows me to use on top of my lap or blankets.  Kept my laptop really cool.
5,Der KÃ¼hler arbeitet nun schon einige Zeit tadellos. Er ist sehr leise und die Regelung der LÃ¼fter funktioniert ebenfalls sehr gut. Der einzige kleine Kritikpunkt sind die ausklappbaren FÃ¼Ãe. Diese haben nicht wie beschrieben zwei HÃ¶heneinstellungen sondern nur eine. Trotzdem eine eindeutige Kaufempfehlung.
5,Bought for my son who has not any any problems with his laptop overheating since this was attached.  It's stylish and very effective and he would recommend it.
5,Just plug 'n' play - so easy now to get my laptop cooled
5,gÃ¼nstiges und absolut taugliches KÃ¼hlpad.. macht richtig frisch und hÃ¤lt den Laptop der sonst stÃ¤ndig abgestÃ¼rzt ist absolut in Form..... kann ich nur weiter empfehlen..Aussage von meinem Sohn (knapp 15 und Nutzer des KÃ¼hlpads): voll cool  und hilfreich das bringts!
5,Not only is it (so far) a faultlessly good bit of kit someone said they thought it was prettier than my Alienware laptop which shocked me to no end.
5,Ich habe das KÃ¼hlpad fÃ¼r meine Tochter gekauft da sie ihren Laptop viel auf den Beinen oder FuÃboden hat wo er sich jedesmal erhitzt und dann aufhÃ¤ngt etc.Sie ist begeistert und ich kann das nur weitergeben. GrÃ¶Ãe Preis-Leistung alles super.
1,Only lasted 8 months before the top two (probably the most important two) fans just stopped working. I have probably only used it a dozen or so times too.I thought the build quality felt a bit flimsy when I got it but as I was only planning on using it every now and again I thought it would be fine.If you are planning on using it more regularly I would suggest getting something else that has better build quality.
5,from 85 degrees on cpu to below 70 can't go wrong with it. Quieter then the laptop fan - another pros. Recommended 100%
5,Lightweight and easy to use. In just 5 minutes my laptop is freezing! Has a couple of fold out legs at the back for tilting too.
3,abit small for my laptop
4,Works like a dream
5,Ich bin leidenschaftlicher Laptop Gamer und habe ein bisschen erfahrung mit den KÃ¼hlpads und davon war die hÃ¤lfte schlecht. Doch dieser KÃ¼hlpad ist sehr gut hÃ¤lt die unterseite schÃ¶n kÃ¼hl die in der hÃ¶he verschiebar. Eigentlich nur zu empfehlen.
1,The fact that as soon as I plugged it in for the first time the top right fan was faulty did not invoke my confidence in this product asked for an immediate refund and although I still need a desktop fan I can't bring myself to buy this one again. A real shame because even with three fans it was still rather effective.(For those that think I've been silly I tried tweaking the fan controls to no avail)
5,I run a Nvidia GTX 970m i7 MSI Ghost Pro laptop and it never overheats with this underneath. Well worth the investment
1,I was pleased with it at first but soon the USB connection became unreliable. I tried lots of USB connectors but the fault is in the pad itself. The fans run OK for a bit if I jiggle the lead and then they stop. The makers have no website and an address in South China so the one year guarantee is a bit meaningless. However Amazon have refunded my money even though I have had it a few months.
3,Not Bad not good either! Not too expensive! All in all an average product! Would have been nice if there was a way to turn of the blue lights
5,Works well .. my laptop is not as hot as it used to be when i was on skype.  Keeps it from cooking from the inside.
5,Super!!! Ist sehr leise mein laptop wird beim spielen nicht mehr so heiÃ. AuÃerdem kann man das kÃ¼hlpad in der Neigung verstellen der pc hat dann eine fÃ¼r mich bessere HÃ¶he. FÃ¼r den Preis einfach top.
5,Ich finds mega nice. Klar es gibt wohl irgendwo bessere aber fÃ¼r den Preis ist das Ding unschlagbar.Es macht auch nicht so nen krassen Sound damit will ich sagen dass die LÃ¼ftung leiser als mein Laptop ist.
5,Sehr stabiles GerÃ¤t. Die LÃ¼fter sind zwar hÃ¶rbar jedoch nicht stÃ¶rend. Mit dem Lappy der ja auch ein eigenes lÃ¼ftergeraush hat kaum zu hÃ¶ren.WÃ¼rde ich jederzeit wieder kaufen.
5,Preis-Leistung passt super. WÃ¼rd ich wieder kaufen.Die Plastikhalter sind mir zwar mal rausgeklippst aber konnte die problemlos wieder einklippsen. Muss aber auch sagen dass das nur passiert ist weil ich den Laptop mit KÃ¼hlpad einhÃ¤ndig manÃ¶vriert habe ;-)
5,Mein Sohn benÃ¶tigt das Teil  weil sein Laptop beim zocken ;-) anfÃ¤ngt zu kochen.Er ist sehr zufrieden.Ein Wort nach zufrieden fehlt noch bevor ich es abschicken kann. Da vergeht einem die Lust am bewerten sorry
5,Sehr leise und kÃ¼hl mein Laptop richtig ab!
5,Super GerÃ¤t. Leise und schÃ¶n. Macht was es soll. FÃ¼r 17 Zoll sehr gut kÃ¶nnte etwas grÃ¶Ãer sein aber ich hab jedoch auch einen echt globalen Laptop
5,As advertised
5,Had this a while now wonted to test b4 review this is great keeps my laptop much cooler then my old 1
5,Ich war erst etwas skeptisch nachdem ich von einem anderen Fabrikat enttÃ¤uscht wurde das hat sich aber recht schnell  geÃ¤ndert. Super KÃ¼hlleistung. Da reicht es  mit reduzierter Leistung zu kÃ¼hlen und man hÃ¶rt so gut wie nichts.
2,Moin.....ich finde nicht das dieses KÃ¼hlpad wirklich besser kÃ¼hlt als andere . Ich konnte kein Unterschied zu meinem anderen feststellen.Ausserdem fand ich die Verarbeitung nicht so gut. Der linke LÃ¼fter macht von anfang an GerÃ¤usche ( lÃ¤uft Unrund ) das hÃ¶rt man leider. Ich habe es wieder abgebaut und werde es zurÃ¼ckgeben.
5,Funktioniert noch immer tadellos! Dieser LÃ¼fter ist sein Geld wert. Leider war mir nach kurzem Gebrauch ein StandfÃ¼Ãchen abgebrochen. Aber ansonsten bis heute top!
5,Works really well with my Dell Studio like the idea of two switches for the fans as I only need to use two at the moment
5,LOVE IT!!!!! keeps my laptops extremely cool under intense usage and under hot weather. Love the high positioning of the laptop and its really comfortable!!!!!!!RECOMMENDED!!!!!!
5,This product is brilliant it keeps my laptop cooler than inbuilt fan.light weight robust and four fans surprisingly quiet good product and prompt delivery  5 stars
5,Ein starkes Teil entspricht voll den Erwartungen und kÃ¼hlt hervorragend. Man kann es nur empfehlen. Verarbeitung gut und die LautstÃ¤rke der KÃ¼hler ist ok
1,Ich hatte mich hauptsÃ¤chlich fÃ¼r dieses KÃ¼hlpad entschieden da es die MÃ¶glichkeit gibt die Fan-Geschwindigkeit stufenlos zu regulieren.Gleich angeschlossen und den Laptop etwas arbeiten lassen so daÃ die Temperatur auch gleich mal hochgeht. Ein Temperatur- Ãberwachungsprogramm lief mit.Habe gleich alle beide (2x2) Fanregler eingeschaltet und da sich bei kleiner bzw. mittlerer Stufe die Temperatur gar nicht reduzierte versuchte ich es mit dem Maximum. KÃ¼hleffekt: 2-3 Grad. Als zusÃ¤tzlichen unerwÃ¼nschten Nebeneffekt war dann auch noch ein schleifendes GerÃ¤usch einer der Fans zu hÃ¶ren.Ich kann daher keine Kaufempfehlung aussprechen und habe das Produkt umgehend zurÃ¼ckgesendet.
5,Der LÃ¼fter wurde sehr schnell geliefert und hÃ¤lt auch was er verspricht. Das PreisleistungsverhÃ¤ltniss ist mehr als super. Man hÃ¶rt die LÃ¼fter so gut wie Ã¼berhaupt nicht und trotzdem ist die KÃ¼hlleistung top!
5,Das Teil ist von der LautstÃ¤rke her total ok. Da muss man schon sehr empfindlich sein wenn das stÃ¶ren soll. Die LÃ¼ftung funktioniert einwandfrei und auch vom Design find ich es echt super.
4,VERY GOOD
5,Er ist leise er ist blau sieht gut aus Preis-Leistung ist sehr gut. KÃ¼hlt gut also man spÃ¼rt eine minimale WÃ¤rme aber Eiszapfen habe ich nicht erwartet. Super ding wÃ¼rde es wieder kaufen.
5,Benutze den LÃ¼fter beim zocken. Da wo mein Laptop sonst nach nur ein Paar Minuten in die Knie gegangen ist heist es jetzt zocken bis der Arzt kommt :-)Klare Kaufempfehlung
5,Der KÃ¼hlers hÃ¤lt was er verspricht.Er ist sehr leise (kaum hÃ¶rbar) und durch den zusÃ¤tzlichen USB-Eingang belegt er praktisch keinen Anschluss am Laptop. Ich bin sehr zufrieden und kann ihn nur weiterempfehlen.
5,Looks great  super quiet and is so good at doing it job my hand actually got cold while using my mouse!! ð
5,works well it keeps my laptop lovely and cool. build is strong and would be hard to break well worth the low price. would recommend
5,Das KÃ¼hlpad hat gute Eigenschaften...1. es kÃ¼hlt gut (keine HitzeabstÃ¼rze mehr) 2. es ist leicht 3. es ist leise. Damit wird es meinen Anforderungen gerecht und ich kann es weiter empfehlen.
3,Am Anfang war toll gelaufen aber nach 6 Monaten geht voll nicht. Ventilatoren laufen sehr langsam u kuehlt laptop nicht so viel.
5,Ich arbeite oft sehr lange an meinem Laptopum Filmprojekte zu erstellen.Der KÃ¼hler leistet super Arbeit.Er blÃ¤st ziemlich kalte Luft.Da wird Einen manchmal selber frisch.Die LautstÃ¤rke ist o.k.Ich wÃ¼rde ihn wieder kaufen.
5,Super zufrieden klasse Teil guter preis.Habe es unter einem 15.6"Acer KÃ¼hltruhe wirklich sehr gut solang die standfÃ¼Ãe aufgeklappt sind. FÃ¼r normalen Betrieb muss man sich darÃ¼ber keine Gedanken machen
5,so far so good. though I think it would be better if it had the 5th fan instead of the logo
4,good
5,Does the job it said it would do. Easy to use can barely hear it when in use which is all the time. Worth buying.
5,Der Gaming Laptop meiner Frau wird gut runtergekÃ¼hlt. Somit ist die Grafikkarte nicht mehr gestresst. LÃ¼fter im normal Betrieb ist angenehm im Max. Betrieb doch hÃ¶rbar.
5,brilliant. i love it. ive got a gaming laptop that gets pretty warm and now i have this . nice and cool!
5,Besser als mein altes LÃ¼fterpad jedoch recht hoch wenn man es auf dem Tisch benutzt. Als Unterlage wenn man mit dem Notebook auf dem Sofa sitzt aber gut. KÃ¼hlleistung ist gut.
5,Bin bis jetzt sehr zufrieden der KÃ¼hler muss jeden Tag 8 Stunden ran und lÃ¤uft prima nicht laut und sehr viel 'GeblÃ¤se'.  HÃ¤lt den Laptop kÃ¼hl genug.
5,Alles bestens aber zum preis her muss ich sagen bisschen zu gÃ¼nstig
5,Does a great job for the right price. Love the blue lights too. My legs now stay a normal temperature when using my laptop
1,Extrem schlechte Verarbeitungen der LÃ¶tstellen. Zwei Ventilatoren haben schon nach einer Woche den Geist aufgegeben.Es macht des Ã¶fteren sehr laute gerÃ¤usche dies stÃ¶ren extrem.Nach dem ich die SchÃ¤den selbst behoben habe (LÃ¶tstellen richtig gelÃ¶tet und soweiter) funktioniert es wie es soll.Ein weiterer Mangel ist das die antirutsch Gummipunkte an der Unterseite das verrutschen des KÃ¼hlpads nicht verhindern sondern das Verrutschen ehr verbessern. Ich kann es auch nicht empfehlen den Laptop mit dem KÃ¼hlpad schrÃ¤g zu stellen da der Laptop dann sofort das Rutschen anfÃ¤ngt.Also alles in allem bitte kaufen sie nicht dieses KÃ¼hlpad!
5,Ja der kÃ¼hler tut was er soll :DHabe einen hochleistungs-gaming-Notebook der normal sehr schnell sehr heiÃ wird aber mit dem KÃ¼hler hierkeine Probleme mehr!Echt zu Empfehlen :)
5,It is a great product. Quite excellent fan speed and lovely blue LED. Very good quality and amazing price. Would recommend.
5,This really works We put windows 10 on our laptop and it was over heating this cools it down and it works thanks.
5,Very prompt delivery.  Good four fan system for use on laptop is very good relatively quiet and cools effectively.
5,Bringt mehr als man erwartet lÃ¤sst sich auch von der StÃ¤rke regulieren und man kann die oberen und die unteren Ventilatoren seperat ein und ausschalten bzw die StÃ¤rke unterschiedlich einstellen
5,Having had some cooling pads before I can easily say this one actually brings down the temperature of my laptop! Ultra light too!
1,This worked very well for the first few days and did a great job of cooling my laptop by just below 10 degrees making much less noise than the laptop fan itself. However after a few gaming sessions of use one of the fans stopped working shortly followed by another slowing down and being less efficient so I had to return the product.
5,Very good my laptop has not gone into high speed cooling since I bought this. Quick delivery. I would not be without it now.
5,Ich habe diesen meinem Freund geschenkt. Endlich lebt sein Lappy nun dank des Super lÃ¼ftungsteils lÃ¤nger :) er ist sehr begeistert! Die blaue Farbe ist auch ein Hingucker :)
5,Perfect 10 out of 10 for this gadget....my Dad was over the moon.
5,Funktioniert wunderbar kann hochgestellt werden. Sind sehr zufrieden. Preis-Leistung stimmt hier absolut. Deshalb habe ich es auch gleich ebenfalls fÃ¼r meine Mutter gekauft :)
5,schnelle lieferung passt super unter meinen laptop die kÃ¼hler sind vielleicht ein bisschen aber was sich dreht macht auch gerÃ¤usche und schoen mit der beleuchtung strahlt blau drunter hervor
5,FÃ¼r den Preis absolut super. Es kÃ¼hlt richtig gut und es ist fast GerÃ¤uschlos. Ich wÃ¼rde es jedem der nicht so viel ausgeben mÃ¶chte empfehlen!
5,Really nice very quiet & does the job perfectly by keeping the laptop cool & so keeping my thighs from burning up.
5,Nicht quadratisch trotzdem praktisch und gut. Funktioniert ohne viel LÃ¤rm zu machen. SchÃ¶nes Design und genug Luftzug um auch bei hoher Leistungsanforderung das Laptop vor Ãberhitzung zu schÃ¼tzen
5,Looks great top and bottom set of fans ajustable does the job superbly much quieter than the laptop fan.
5,KÃ¼hlpad gekauft wie abgebildet passt super fÃ¼r 17" LÃ¼fter laufen sehr leise LÃ¼fter sind einzeln einzustellen und abschaltbar blaue Beleuchtung nicht stÃ¶rend kann empfohlen werden
5,Die Temperatur der Festplatte wird um etwa 10Â°C gesenkt und der Laptop schaltet sich nicht mehr wg. Ãberhitzung aus. Und das wird erstaunlicherweise sehr leise und unauffÃ¤llig (17"-Laptop) bewerkstelligt.
2,One or two of the fans already squeak slightly. Apart from its overall cheap feeling it does the job and runs quietly until the squeaking starts.
5,endlich einmal ein KÃ¼hler der richtig kÃ¼hltes gibt nichts zu bemÃ¤ngeln; flÃ¼sterleisevorn sind ausklappbare Halter welche den PC sichern wenn die hinteren StandfÃ¼Ãe des LÃ¼fters ausgefahren werden
2,Das Produkt wird wohl nach Produktion nicht getestet. Bei meinem rattert ein hinterer LÃ¼fter sehr laut. Die anderen sind leise und geben ein gleichmÃ¤Ãig tiefes LÃ¼ftergerÃ¤usch (Ã¤hnlich eines Ventilators) von sich was nicht unangenehm ist. Ich habe jetzt die hinteren LÃ¼fter komplett abgeschaltet.
5,I've tried so many others before this one. This one really does the job. My laptop no longer overheats.
5,Der LaptopkÃ¼hler ist wirklich  top.ich stelle ihn nur minimal an und das reicht  vollkommen aus.Kann ich nur empfehlen
5,ein Kaufkriterium war der evtl. erzeugte LÃ¤rm des LÃ¼fters  (hier mit "sehr leise" beworben) die Erwartungen hat er voll erfÃ¼llt
5,Item works brilliant. Nice to have two separate controls for separate pairs of fans. USB power cable could be longer.
5,This is a great fan No noise and cools the laptop perfectly no more hot knees. would definitely buy again.
5,Der LÃ¼fter hÃ¤lt was er verspricht. Er ist leise gut verarbeitet und kÃ¼hlt mein Laptop gut runter gerade bei anspruchsvollen spielen fÃ¶rderlich
5,Really good keeps my laptop cool. My friend came round and saw it and bought one himself.
5,Fans are really powerful and near silent. Stand is great for elevating the screen. Very pleased
5,Fantastic product. Keep my MacBook Pro temperature down.I will recommend it.
5,PERFEKT kann ich nur empfehlen!!! LÃ¤uft wie am ersten Tag!!! Sehr Leiseund ne tolle Beleuchtung ..( Blau ) Genial..mit zusÃ¤tzliche usb verteiler.
5,Perfekter LaptopkÃ¼hler. Einziges Manko bei CS Go wird der Laptop mit der Zeit trotzdem heiÃ. Perfekter geht es nicht. Klare kaufempfehlung
5,I am very pleased with this product. I use it to cool my Acer laptop. It is very quiet and effective.
5,schneller Versand Lieferung einwandfrei habe das Produkt fÃ¼r meinen Sohn gekauft der meint es sÃ¤he ziemlich cool aus kÃ¼hlt den PC beim Spielen effektiv runter
5,Absolutely brilliant piece of kit does the job of cooling my gaming laptop perfectly
1,Ich wollte fÃ¼r mein MacBook Pro ein KÃ¼hlpad mit starken LÃ¼ftern hier wurde ich leider enttÃ¤uscht.Pro:- groÃe LÃ¼fter- lÃ¤uft per USB- 156" Laptops Macbooks passen optimalContra:- zu schwach- kÃ¼hlt nicht richtigFazit:Bedingt der FunktionalitÃ¤t keine Kaufempfehlung da die LÃ¼fter einfach zu schwach sind.
5,KÃ¼hlt den Laptop und ist nicht worklich laut(ErtrÃ¤glich)! Es reduziert die Temperatur ungefÃ¤hr um 10-15Â°C. WÃ¼rde ich bei bedarf wieder kaufen!
2,Die Anordnung der LÃ¼fter ist vllt nicht schlecht und die separate LÃ¼ftersteuerung fÃ¼r die jeweils oberen und unteren KÃ¼fter ist auch gut aber das wars auch schon.
2,Looks good but two fans burned..Not sure whether it was due to not lifting the standing in the slanting order.
5,Powerful efficient and quiet. Perfect to stop an old/work laptop overheating and crashing. Well worth the money!
5,quiet stylish exact fit for 17 inch screen so pleased i bought my son one
5,Das Teil arbeitet leiste und zuverlÃ¤ssig. ErfÃ¼llt voll und ganz seinen zweck und ist jeden Cent wert. Wobei der Preis hier unschlagbar ist.
5,Top kÃ¼hler^^er kÃ¼hlt sogar so stark das man im Sommer den Ventilator stehen lassen kann^^wÃ¼rde ich immer wieder kaufen^^volle Sterne von mir
5,das teil lÃ¤uft relativ leise gute kÃ¼hlung .die schrÃ¤gstellmÃ¶glichkeit ist besonders praktisch.  lieferung war schnell hier gibt es nichts zu beanstanden
5,Its very handy and keeps my laptop cool at any time. Would recommend it to everyone.
5,Der LÃ¼fter ist meiner laienhaften Meinung nach recht leistungsstark und nicht zu laut. Dementsprechend sehe ich keinen Grund fÃ¼r einen Punkteabzug.
5,Brilliant! works really well love the fans turning them on and off. Will really help when my product overheats.
5,Perfekt nicht zu laut und kÃ¼hlt das Laptop richtig gut.Laptotp steht nur etwas hoch kann mit externer Tastatur gut behoben werden.
2,poor quality stand came loose very quickly
5,ErfÃ¼llt genau die Erwartungen stylisch praktisch. Sehr zufriedenstellen fÃ¼r ziemlich alle gÃ¤ngigen Laptop-GrÃ¶Ãen geeignet.LÃ¼fter sind leise geringe bis keine GerÃ¤uschentwicklung.
5,Does what it was designed for keeps laptop cool.
5,Die Funktion ist gut; die LautstÃ¤rke ist angenehm allerdings vibriert das KÃ¼hlpad ein wenig was sich auf die Tastatur Ã¼bertrÃ¤gt
5,Sieht richtig stylisch aus. man hat ein DrehrÃ¤dchen dran wo man die LÃ¼fter einstellen kann  wie schnell sie laufen sollen .Klasse !
5,Really cools down my laptop cannot fault it and good service to boot as well
5,Dieses Teil ist seinen Preis wert.Es ist schon einige Wochen im Einsatz und ich mÃ¶chte es nicht missenGrÃ¼Ãe
5,Kein Problem bei der Lieferung oder bei der Benutzung. Nur ein bisschen laut aber die Steuerung der KÃ¼hlung geht ohne Problem
5,It's working perfectly!It came in time and was as descibed!Very good and affordable sellers!
5,Mit dem Teil geht jetzt mein Ã¤lteres Notebook fast wie neu. Alle Erwartungen sind erfÃ¼llt. Auch die Handlichkeit vollkommen ok
5,ÃuÃerst leistungsfÃ¤higes GerÃ¤t sehr stabil und paÃgenau fÃ¼r unterschiedliche Laptop-GrÃ¶Ãen sehr leise trotz hoher Leistung hÃ¶chste Stufe ist nur im Extremfall notwendig
5,habe den Artikel fÃ¼r meinen Laptop zum KÃ¼hlen da er lange in Betrieb ist .Gutes Preis /LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis wÃ¼rde ich wieder kaufen
5,Excellent item - could not ask for more. Quick delivery too.
5,best thing I've bought in a long while laptop works a treat now never over heats
5,After 2+ years is still working perfectly thanks
2,lÃ¼ftet klappern nach nur 1 Woche1 drehrealer ist defekt und lÃ¤dt sich um 360Â° drehendie GerÃ¤usche sind stÃ¶rendkÃ¼hlen tut er aber meinen mac 15" echt gut
5,Top Teil. Macht was es soll. Preis Leistung passt . Auch fÃ¼r 17 Zoll ausreichend groÃ. Klare kauf empfehlung. :-)

1,Machte nach 4 EinsÃ¤tzen Krach ohne Ende obwohl ich die KÃ¼hler nicht mal auf Vollgas gedreht hatte. ZurÃ¼ck geben geht seid vorgestern nicht mehr... Das is eine Frechheit!
1,Ich habe das GerÃ¤t ca. 5 x fÃ¼r 2-3 Stunden laufen lassen danach kaum noch benutzt weil der LÃ¼fter meines Notebooks zeitweilig wieder in Ordnung war. Gestern habe ich den KÃ¼hler wieder eingeschaltet und nun lÃ¤uft er nur noch ganz schwach und kÃ¼hlt kaum. Ãrgerlich.

5,I have no other product to compare this toso my review is unbalanced in that aspecthoweveras far as I can tellit is excellent.Does the necessary joblooks goodand although appears not as robust as may be thoughtin actuality is strong.Meshto allow the coolinglugs to prevent slippagea nice colourtoothe electric blue.Turns on and off with my PCand hopefully will etend its active life.No more unexpected shut downsI hopedue to heating problems.Using a laptop cushdeskmy legs aren't noticeably coolerbut it's clearly workingand seems a very good purchase.Laptops are rather misnamedas they overheat on the lapbut I regret this particular buy not one whit.PC's are expensivesotake care of itthis can't harm the longevityonly help.
5,Habe den LÃ¼fter fÃ¼r meinen Gaming Laptop gekauft.Klar wird der Laptop noch heiÃ dass passiert halt wenn der Prozessor unter Vollast lÃ¤uft. Aber ich merke dass im normalen Betrieb der LÃ¼fter vom Laptop nicht mehr an geht. Ich bin wirklich sehr zufrieden.
