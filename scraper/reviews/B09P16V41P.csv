5,Great Buy!  Bought these new C-to-C charging cables to be compatible with Sumsung Galaxy S22.  They are excellent!  The fast charging is excellent and these cables support that. Great Quality with the turned connectors protected cable (no kinking) etc.  I also use these on older C type devices and are fine compatibility.  The 3' is excellent for the car and work table top charger.
4,The cables work fine I'm not sure about the elbow design since it may block other ports using it with a computer. Also I would attach micro-USB adapter to make it more durable. Other cable makers do it.
5,These are pretty good I would say that the only downside is that they are hard to unplug when you have a thick case on your iPad.
5,I have to get me more of these
5,I got these braided cables to charge my S22 Ultra. I ruined my other cables because I use my phone while charging. It works I like the audible √óclick√ó I can hear when the cable is inserted. I will definitely buy again.
5,Works great. Good build quality.
5,Looks well constructed. Time will tell
5,The cables came on time as promised.  The are good lengths and charge quickly.
5,I have an I pad Pro and it is large and bulky. If requires a C-pin charger. The design of this charger is perfect for the I-pad. Great quality a month later if still works! Just wanted to give an update this cord is still working üëç
5,Using these right angle cords has been a total game changer! The cord seems to be out of the way now when charging. Charges just as fast as any of the other cords. Love the multiple lengths I received and I only need a short one at the office and a longer one at home. Great quality for the price!
5,Like the breaded cable and angele pin connector
5,I personally liked the 90 degree end connector it keeps counter space usage to a minimum.  It also helps me identify the c to c connector ends and with the dozens of cables I have laying around for various devices.
5,I brought these cables to pair of with my new 4k TV and surround sound.  They work flawlessly.
3,These cords seem well made and sturdy.  I like the right angle connection plug which should result in longer life.  However one the four cables stopped working completely after 3 days.  The other three are fine.  I hope this is just a fluke and that you can order with confidence.  But be forewarned.
3,They worked great at first. Seemed really nice and sturdy. But within a month all of them stopped working. Even the one we kept tucked behind our headboard away from kids. We are very particular with the adult device only cords and try to always be gentle. Just spend a little extra and get one good cord.
5,I wanted a cable that had the charger on the " side"  that wouldn't bend when using.I love it but I have a hard time pulling it out because of arthritis.  No problem...I switched ends for phone on adapter.  Perfect!!
5,This cable is way less expensive than others and it works with super-fast charging on my Samsung S21 Ultra. Unlike older versions this cable works no matter which way its plugged into the block or phone. I'd recommend this cable.
5,I bought these originally to have a long cable for my pine64 soldering iron. Works fantastically for that. Works great for phone and tablet too.
5,These cables are fast charging work great and are that heavy duty no Frey cording
3,Bought these for my external LCD panel but it would power the panel on but no video or anything else. It took a bit but I looked inside the end and only half the pins are there! It is only a Charging cable NOT a USB-C Cable. SO...... This will NOT run any USB-C devices like an external Hard Drive or anything but it will charge your cell phone! Not what I wanted. Could be stated a bit better so I hope this review helps others. Other than that the cable seems like a nice cable just not useable for me.
5,Exactly what I needed
2,First off for the price they're a great deal. I have 4 wall units with built in usb and usb-c pd-3.0 ports. my monoproce 6ft cable always fast charges no issues Plugged the 6ft into the wall unit starts fast charging on stays fast for about 30 seconds than goes to regular charging. Plugged the 6ft into my portable charger and fast charges without an issue. However I specifically got this for my man cave with the wall unit and it won't fast charge. I tried the 10ft on the wall unit and that one doesn't fast charge at all. The only cables I'll most likely be using will be the 3ft ones as those so far seem to be consistent with the different chargers. I should know better than to stray from monoproce cables. Lifetime warranty and always consistent.
5,The charging speed is very good and I'm loving the longer cords
2,Nice cords however they do not support a USB connection and therefore aren't compatible with Android Auto fast charging or any other applications. Basically they're just a regular charging cord and that's it.
1,Tiene buenos acabado parece ser de calidad pero al parecer no lo es estuve usando aproximadamente de 1 a 2 meces y ya no sirven no han sufrido maltrato no estan doblados simplemente empiezan a dar carga lenta hasta dejar de funcionar. No los recomiendo prueben con otras marcas.
2,Doesn't conduct enough power to charge my MacBook. Gave away one cord so can't return.
1,2 out of the 4 cables don‚Äôt work.
5,I've only used one of the 3 cords that I purchased but so far it works as described. I'll update this review if I find they end up lacking in quality in terms of durability. Otherwise it's a charging cable at a good price and I have 3 so I will have to wait and see.
5,A good set of USB C cables.  Looks and feel sturdy.  Aesthetically nice too.
5,These cords work exactly as you'd expect. They carry enough juice to power my phone and Steam Deck both of which want 45W.I like that it comes with the three sizes -- I use the 10 ft one by the couch so that I can charge my phone while I watch TV but not have to leave it way over there and I use the 3 ft one on my desk to plug my phone into my computer.
4,This is a good set of cables for charging. Please note that it does not push the max data bandwidth.
5,I got these for use with my new iPad that uses usb-c instead of Lightning connectors. I needed longer cables than the one Apple provides.I have used these right-angle cables before and like them better than straight connectors especially when reading in portrait orientation. It makes for less strain on the cable at the device.Pros- solid cables feel like they will last- enough surface to pull the cable from the end of the device. Much better than the slick plastic provided with my iPad.- right-angle design on one end eliminates stain especially with portrait orientation.Cons- none found so farRecommended.
5,I bought these cables to replace the short charging cables that came with the Oculus VR units.  I like that I can plug in the charging block and still sit on the couch and use the VR unit.  So far they have held up nicely and I have confidence they will stand up over time.
5,I picked these up for my new pickup (2022 Tacoma). As a secondary charging cord for the person sitting in shotgun they're great. As mentioned elsewhere you can't use these for data so they don't work for the Android Auto port but they make it easy to let your co-driver charge their phone or as a secondary charger for modern phones. They charge fast too!
5,The AINOPE 10FT 6.6ft and two 3.3ft Type C to Type C fast charging Cables comes with a set of four cables neatly packaged. The Type C to Type C cable comes in three different colors to choose from black Gray Blue and Red.Pros:The AINOPE 10FT 6.6ft and two 3.3ft Type C to Type C Cables are very well wrapped in tough nylon material. The ends of Type C connectors are enclosed in metal enclosure that are the same color as the cable and are long enough to grip for easy connect and disconnect the cable. There is rubber mold that wraps the cable that meets the metal enclosure to protect the wire from bending at this point as shown in the Pictures. This is a good design as I have had other cables that have broken with time by that point and renders the cable useless.What I like about the AINOPE cables is the 90-degree Type C connector on one end of the cable. This is great to have when connected directly to an outlet with Type C connection that are below a counter to avoid any kinky of the cable when in use. For the longer 10ft and 6.6 cables it is best for the 90-degree end to be connected to the phone.These cables have a data transfer speed of 40 to 60 MB/S (480 Mbps) which is very fast transfer speed for pictures video and upload and download of files.At 10ft and 6.6ft long are long enough for use in the living room to charge your phone while in use. For the two 3.3ft cables are more suited for kitchen bedroom after hour charging or cars with the Type C connection.Looks and feel of the cables are very good with nylon wrapping for not only made to look good but also to protect the wires and durability of the cables. The 10ft 6.6ft and the two 3.3ft Type C Cables also come with a long Velcro strap to keep the cables neatly folded when not in use and easy to store away.Cons:None at this time but time will tell after many uses.
5,Phone shows " super fast charging " every time I plug in. And it's awsome. Love the different lengths. Works great every time
5,Three braided USB C to USB C cables at this price point is a great value. One of the ends is angled which offers flexibility and can lessen stress on your phone's USB C port depending on your use scenario especially if you are using your phone while it is charging. I also really like the attached Velcro tie for cable management for either storage or for when you do not need the full length of the cable.
5,I ordered this cable because despite having 2 million usb-type cables of every variant I never seem to be able to find the right cable when I need one! The problem in my household is that my cables multiply they get entangled and they are rarely labeled. So after I drop 15 bucks on a white or black cable it just gets twisted up together. Because my eyes are not great it is impossible to separate the expensive cables from the cheap the new from the old or the usb-types from one another. This cable is great because of the unique color of the jacket as it stands out from my other cables. It comes in three generous sized lengths and works as fast as any of my other cables. I'm pleased so far.
5,I‚Äôve been using these for charging a new iPad Pro and have had no issues.  I wanted a longer cable so I could charge while using it.  This Ainope kit came with 4 cables total allowing me to distribute cables around my house as needed.  The middle one (6.6 ft) allows me to lay in bed and charge.  The shorter ones I staged at my computer for iTunes backups.  The longest one (10 ft) is going in my travel kit for hotel use where you never know the outlets are going to be relative to where you sit or the bed.  Each cable comes with a Velcro type cable wrap/tie.One of the Amazon rating categories is ‚Äúcharging power‚Äù but I have no way to measure if these are restricting the charging in any way.  I can say they do not get hot and the iPad seems to charge in the same way and time that it did with the Apple cable that came with it (I‚Äôm using the same charging brick).The connectors ‚Äúclick‚Äù into the iPad and charging brick with authority.  In other words they have a tight connection and they are not loose in any way and definitely will not be falling out.  I particularly like the 90 degree connector end because it takes some of the stress of the connector/plug.  I use that 90 degree end at the iPad end.I cannot come up with anything substantial to criticism them on.  The cables work well.
5,This is my second order of these cables.  The first ones are working very well so I ordered some more.My original review:I am using these as charging cables for several USB-C devices.  So far I have no complaints.  The strain relief on these cords is better than many and should help these last a long time.From the listing:Max output: 60W 20V/3.1A. Can fast charging S21 80% within 30mins.Data sync: USB 2.0  480Mbps. Can transfer 1Gb file within 30s. (Note: Don't support video output)Notice that these do not support video.  I am using them purely for charging so this is not an issue for me.I chose these specifically for the 90 degree connector.  For my use this is much better than a straight connector.  It is out of the way and does not get accidentally unplugged like cords with straight connectors do.Five stars.I
5,Should work just as well for any USB-C device.
5,I had issues with my Lenovo Yoga not wanting to charge with one of my chargers that is rated to be able to charge 60W max. It wouldn‚Äôt charge so when I swapped cables with this particular brand it started working like it was supposed to which made my life easier because now I can charge that laptop my 2021 iPad Pro and nintendo switch with one charger instead of 3 separate chargers.There‚Äôs a difference between USB-C cables. This is for power/charging only. This will not do file transfers just so you‚Äôre aware.
5,When i 1st got my new phone i hadnt realized it only took USB-c charging cords and i had to go all over town to find one. I wasn‚Äôt able to find a long cord nor a braided cord either. I. Was only able to find a short rubber coated version and if i know anything about those from past experience they get frayed and wron and need to be fixed until your new one arrives. You know that will have to order new cords sooner or later and these braided ones are far more long lasting and robust. They don‚Äôt fray or come apart. I love these ones because they have a right angle and you can choose if you want the right angle to be the part that enters that charging port on your phone or on the charger. The best thing about this pack is - the choice of lengths. I can have different cables in different rooms or in my car. Why did i wait so long to order?
5,I ordered these because of the variety of lengths they offer plus the fact that I prefer a braided cable over the plastic type.  So far I have used one (the 10-foot) to connect to a wireless charger I have plus one (the 6.6-foot) to connect directly to a Samsung Galaxy S10+ phone.  Both have worked perfectly.These cables are slightly thinner than some other braided cables I have on hand but this is not something that I consider to be a major concern.I am very pleased with these and consider them to be a good value considering their quality and the number you get with the variety of lengths
5,These are nice cables.  Turns out they were better than expected.  Initially got because of the right angles at one end.We have a lot of devices that need USB C now.  What it didn't expect was for them to work at 65w warp charge on my OnePlus 9 using the factory charger.  Also tested with 90w power delivery on my dock and x360 laptop which performed great.  The outer casing will definitely stop them from getting frayed as fast.  The strain relief boot is also longer than some so should resist my boys bending them. Also look pretty nice.
5,These cables are well-made and appear like they will last a long time. The USB-C connectors have good strain relief and appear to be pretty robust. The cable is covered in a synthetic fabric braid that will be great for abrasion resistance.Fast charging worked as expected and the assortment of cable sizes is convenient and a great value.The right angle connectors can be very useful in certain situations.Overall I'm really happy with these cables.
5,These cables are made of really great quality and are very durable. I got them to charge my oculus while playing and for that they work great and deliver adequate power supply.
5,The Ainope cables come in a firm tight braid but is soft to the touch and very flexible.  The end connectors have a high-quality feel and rubberized cover on the braid to help keep it working.I measured the length of each is as listed when you include the connector example tip to tip the 6.6 for cord is 80 inches exactly.  Each also comes with a proper Velcro strap (see pic).Charging with a super-fast 45w charger delivered ma/hour as expected on my Pixel 6 Pro and Sammy Note.  When under 20% was getting 4800 ma/h.  Excellent.Copying an 8GB file took 3 minutes 33 seconds roughly a transfer rate of 37.5 MB/s.  About average for an android to windows copy speed.These have a high-quality feel and at the price point for 4 USB C cables (even a coupon at the time of this review) it‚Äôs an easy yes to get some.
5,They work great for my iPad Air 4. Fast charging.Great price.I like that they come in different lengths so I can choose whichever suits my best needs in different room I‚Äôm using it (meaning longer one for bedroom charge shorter for car charge etc).It‚Äôs also well protected by braided fibers around the cable from my cats destroying it. So cat proof.I‚Äôd recommend
5,These are nice if you have charging blocks behind furniture so the cables do not stick out as far.  It is also nice if you have to use your phone while charging because the cable is not in the way of my hand as much.
5,Electronics are slowly but surely moving away from the old USB-A to the USB-C. They are smaller and they are reversible meaning you can plug them in either way not like a USB-A which only goes in one way. These Ainope C cables are braided for strength and have a sometimes handy right angle plug and a straight plug on the other end.  I have a Pixel phone and a Oneplus and both take fast charge at 30 watts. These handle that load easily.  It is also useful to have 3' & 6" cords. 5 stars for the value and quality.
5,These cords came quickly and just as described.  I love that I have shorter cables for the car and longer cables for the house.  The right angle is nice and keeps the cords from just hanging down.  Sometimes when using the older cords that are straight that extra amount that sticks out before it bent got in the way.  That does not happen with these.  These are also fast charging cords and if you have never compared slow cords to fast cords you should.  It is half the time or less to charge your phone.  Nice purchase I am thinking about getting another set.
5,Excellent quality nice package of 3 varieties short medium and long. I found all of these sizes are useful through my experiences with USB cables. Right angle is something nice to have especially if you already have straight ones.
5,These are well made cables that work great. They look good too. The nylon braid is much better choice than plastic one. The Velcro strap is definitely a plus. Overall I feel these are quality products and they will last.
5,I bought these to charge my MacBook Pro but didn‚Äôt realize 60W does not provide enough juice.My bad.The cables look to be very good quality very well constructed and flexible.
5,No tengo quejas..
5,Nice variety of lengths..works great with my phonr and fast charger
5,Work great over the past few weeks. Able to super fast charge my phone.
1,It is a standard charger not a fast charging USB. If you don't mind having your phone charging for over 3hrs then this one is for you.
5,Good cables nicely packaged.  Even came with little cord management velcro straps that I wasn't expecting.  Keeps everything tidy when you don't need the full length of the cable.  It's a nice assortment of fast charger cables at a good price.
5,Excelente producto. Funciona perfectamente con la carga super r√°pida en los cargadores Samsung de 45 w
