4,I'm a constant gamer typically playing Apex Legends. I was going through a pair of Duracell AA's very often and I figured I needed a more cost effective option. I purchased this kit after reading the description. The kit works great it's compact lightweight the charging indicator lights are bright and easy to determine if charged or dead/charging.When received I opened the box got all the battery packs on the charger and allowed to charge for 6 hours. After they all showed fully charged I put one in my Xbox controller and started gaming. I was surprised when the battery pack lasted for 3 days (15-20 hours playtime) on the first charge! This battery life continued for about a month at which point the battery life started to decrease. I've used them daily for about a month and half now and charge will typically last about 6-8 hours of play timeOverall these are worth the money and I would recommend them. Though the battery life decreases over time I'd say they still save you lots of money over using traditional AA batteries.
5,My nephews are avid gamers.  Comment ~ The Noiposi Rechargeable battery pack for Xbox One S/X and Xbox Series S/X Controllers works awesome and I'm so happy I own a set of these batteries! My brothers and I play all of the time and we go through a lot of batteries. We didn't want to pay for the Microsoft ones because they are super expensive so we got this one and we are very pleased! We get about 20 hours of usable time per battery which lasts about 2 weeks for us! They charge quickly and don't really make the controller much heavier. It's a 2600 mAh battery and you get 4 of them or one per controller. Overall I give this 5 stars!
5,What a great gift for yourself or your kids. We share an x xbox so this rechargeable battery pack for Xbox one controllers is perfect never have to worry about having a working controller. This4x2600mah Xbox one controller battery pack has high-capacity rechargeable batteries and a charging dock.Made for Xbox one s/x the Xbox series s/x controller will give you long-lasting batteries with up to 25h playing time. These batteries really do last longer than your typical ones .no more worrying about interrupting your game for swapping the battery. Not to mention this thing just looks cool as a spaceship.
5,Brought these for my son.. he love them. He stated one will stay charge for a couple days. Which is good bc he's on the game all day.
5,Works wonders! Battery life is for days on end and they charge in a snap! I cannot describe how much I love this it is so helpful
4,Order was delivered quickly. Batteries and charger seem well mase
5,So easy to switch out and same time better for the environment and wallet.
5,Great size it’s nice to have 4 batteries to switch out between the controllers. We were going through so many AA batteries before switching to these rechargeable ones.
5,I've had this item for a few weeks now and it has not let me down at all. I keep the USB cord plugged into the Xbox Series X and it keeps three of the four batteries charged and ready. When the one in my controller needs a recharge a simple swap is done and I'm off playing again.The batteries themselves last quite a while. I play several hours a night and the batteries last a few nights for me. I've not recorded actually time but I feel like they last longer than standard AA batteries when they are installed.The only issue I had initially until I figured it out is that the batteries only truly fit in one way. Yes they might go into the controller if forced but be sure to check where the little tab is on top of the battery and match it to the controller. Other than that these are the perfect companion to the Xbox Series X controllers.
5,Worth having honestly. No problems so far like having 3 full battery’s on hand when playing all night lol
4,So these are nice the normal cover for xbox controller covers the battery perfectly the only issue I got is the battery will just die 9/10 times. There's no low battery warning. Tested with other brands for confirmation that it doest show the low battery warning
4,My son was going through so many batteries in him Xbox one controller so one day I decided to invest in reusable battery packs. Based on reviews I chose these one and he has had no complaints. He says they hold charges for a great amount of time he got 4 in this set which is also great.
5,Omg this is a life savor for my series X. Now I have plenty of batteries. And it’s easy keeping them charged up so I can continue my gaming. ^^
5,We love this charger and battery pack combo! The ability to charge 4 batteries at a time ensures that our gaming is never interrupted! The charging time is actually a lot faster than what is stated and we’ve seen battery life in upwards of 24-36 hrs between charges (with heavy gaming and not fully depleting battery. pack). These are actually better than the battery pack that comes with the console! Easy to set up easy to insert and super fast charging! Definitely recommend!
5,I would like to say first off this shop is completely about customer satisfaction %100 they make Shure that you are taken care of if any problems occur they are fast to respond the Rechargeable Battery Pack is of good quality looks amazing with the lights color of red and green that look cool at night I think this would be a great product for any one looking to upgrade there charging station to a new one. And you get four batteries that's a great deal right there just alone. So if your looking to  buy a  Rechargeable Battery Pack and station this one here will do the job.
4,2 out of 4 battery packs quit charging after one month of use. Don’t recommend for the price
4,We had them for about a week and one of them is unable to charge. They might not last long. The prongs to charge are stuck inside the piece.
5,He love it and so do I. I don't have to keep hearing ma I need batteries.
5,The batteries are absolutely phenomenal and last a super long time I absolutely love them! The only issue I have with them is half the battery packs have had a cell die in them so they no longer charge nor hold a charge. I still use the other 2 but not having 4 makes gaming a little harder due to battery swapping so frequently. Pictures were taken in the dark to accent the lighting feature and how it looks! Review has been updated to 5 stars so others can understand how amazing this product is!
5,I bought this rechargeable battery pack charging station for my 2 son's and it is awesome. It fits perfectly for their Xbox 1 controllers. They hold a super long charge and were fully charged up on recieving them. They are fast charging as well which is a huge plus and I love that it includes 4 rechargeable batteries because they can use 2 each and charge 2 so it ensures they will always have a charged battery. Aweome price and value and definately recommend these rechargeable batteries.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The rechargeable battery pack comes with a charger that can charge up to 4 batteries at a time. What a perfect charger for many batteries and for a good price and a perfect gift for any gamer. The charging time is 3 hours and holding time is 20 hours
5,Have used over 12 hours without having to swap batteries
5,Fits perfect in both our controllers. They charge fast and last a long time. Will buy again!! Highly recommend these!
5,Really simple to install.  Battery life is pretty good on the controller  haven’t had it long enough to say how long it will last reason for 4star longevity. Overall worth it
2,I loved these when I first got them in April. However it’s now September and half of them no longer work. The ones that are lighting up green are not charged as they do not work in either of my controllers now. It’s really frustrating because I bought them so I would not have to buy batteries again and now I’m going to have to. 2 stars simply because 2 of them are still working.
3,Batteries do not seem to have the power that others do.
5,Liked so much bought second one for grandson. Great product even batteries.
5,My husband is a die hard gamer. We go through batteries like crazy. This is perfect for him. He definitely approves.
5,For gaming with two controllers.
5,Very easy install and used for gaming
5,Love this works great!
2,It says charged but isn't often... Since 1st day!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I buyed the battery back on May but I am just trying it now and 3 of the 4 battery doesn't work and since I past the dead line I cant return the product.
1,4 batteries last me 4 months. Don’t waste your money.
1,Its only been 2 months since purchase and 2 batteries won't hold any sort of charge anymore. Not worth the money get another option.
1,The dock did not charge the batteries. The replacement did not either. I got a refund. Do not waste your time. This product is faulty.
1,Horrible
1,2 batteries have stopped working
4,Great since it’s easy to set up recharge is fast And super convenient. However I’ve only had them for 2 months exactly and one of the batteries charges all the way up when installed to the controller it doesn’t work.
5,I game often enough (every other day for a few hours) and on weekends sometimes long periods of time (8 hours). I have had no issues with these and have loved having them available in the holder and ready to go. Battery life is great! I'm getting close to 20 hours per charge. I'm saving so much money using these over buying regular batteries.
5,Bought these for my boyfriend and they work pretty well. Last a decent amount of time between charge. Will say that on the first pack I receivedfour batteries  work well in the controller. The batteries last a fair while. The stand is cool with a nice green x projection at the base.It is  very useful if you play for long time and do not like cables (play and charge kits) as you can quickly take battery out and put a new pack in
4,They fit the xbox one controller perfectly. If you can figure out the orientation of normal batteries you can figure this one out.Instructions are easy to follow and the whole thing is pretty intuitive.I picked these for the cool factor becuase they all seem to be pretty much the same product with a different charger. It even has these slots under the lights to display that sharp X logo which is so lame its actually cool.These cost just as much as an 8 pack of energizer rechargeables so if thats a decision factor for you Ill tell you my experience: anyone scavenging for batteries at home will ultimately take your controller batteries so having something exclusive for it is definitely worth the value.These charged too fast in my opnion so they were either pre-charged the light lies or they simply charge fast. I havent had any issues yet but rest assured if I have any I will definitely update. So far so good
5,This is great for keeping the batteries charged and ready to go. Since the XBox 1 and XBox Series X use cross-compatible chargers this works for both. It charges fast.  It's small and out of the way. It keeps little things like battery life from getting in the way of your gaming. I found no issues worth mentioning. The cat has knocked it off the dresser a time or two and it didn't break so points for sturdiness.
4,Rechargeable Xbox One batteries. Pretty simple stuff here. They charge well in the circle block they click in with a firm connection and the lights are easy to make out. Green it is charged red its not done yet.They should work better than the previous ones I used (from the pink bunny company) since those did not maintain a reliable connection to the charging prongs.Really the only fault I find with this is the lack of a power plug. It uses a USB-C connection which is nice it comes with a cord but no plug. The directions specify a strong adapter something not everyone has just lying around. Fix that and this is a 5 star choice.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I'm a little bit blonde... I was trying for like 3 minutes flipping it back and forth trying to figure out why my controller wouldn't turn on until I realized all of the battery packs were completely dead. I like how the lights are arrows but you don't notice until you plug it in. After they were charged they basically last forever. I used one battery for 3 days straight about 6+ hrs every day... (I mostly use my Xbox for crunchyroll) so that being said if you game with it it might not last 3 days but it will definitely last more than a day. Definitely recommend as a gift for kids or for a gamer friend.
5,Includes: charger base usb cable 4 batteriesUSB cable is 39" from one end to the other. Weights .9 oz.Type A on the Xbox side and Type C on the charger side.Nice quality cable with a silicone rubber type outer.Batteries are 1500 mAh each and weight 1.4 oz each.Have two silver prongs on the left side housing is a black plastic.Charing base has 4 built in red and green LED's located at each battery charge port.Insert rechargeable batteries with metal prongs down. Green fully charged red is charging.When charging is complete flip the rechargeable batteries soo that the prongs are facing up.Insert battery into a controller prongs on the left side with the 1500 mAh facing towards the back.(see photo) Charging takes about 3 hours.I'm getting all day play on just one of these batteries well 2 actually.One can last me a week with on and off gaming when time prevails.Having the 3 as a backup is great and I only need to charge them all once a month.Better than using regular AA batteries and no worries of battery corrosion.Great experience and no overheating issues. Good battery life.And yes these fit in the Xbox One and newer consoles.Easily I can place in my xbox one xbox one x xbox series s xbox series x controllers.Even the xbox one elite 1st gen.Makes a great gift.And yes I actually have all the consoles mentioned.Hope this was helpful.

This one is excellent and all of them work perfectly and no issue reported. The charging base input is type C and comes with the cable. The battery fits perfectly and are durable and don't have drain problem. Highly recommend for more details check the video and pictures I uploaded.
5,No complaints.  They install easy and are easy to swap out. Not sure about long term lifespan but three months in they still work just fine
5,In the package is a charging station charging cord and 4 battery packs. The charging station is very lightweight but seems to be durable. The battery packs came mostly charged. My experience has been that one battery pack lasts around 6-8 hours of continued use from the beginning. Charging a fully drained pack takes around an hour. We typically put them all on charge each night. Having 4 battery packs means there is a charged pack at all times so no more fights amongst the kids on who gets the batteries or stealing them from the remote. Very pleased with this item and recommend it.
5,My son really likes these. They work great for his Xbox series S remotes.  The initial charge only took about 2hrs. He gets several hours of game play with each charge. The instructions were easy to understand. Great rechargeable batteries!  Would definitely recommend
5,The Noiposi Rechargeable Battery Pack for the Xbox One Controller is a great addition to my Xbox console collection! It comes with 4 battery packs! Mine were fully charged upon arrival! The charging unit itself has an awesome design! The unit uses a USB cord that can work with an adapter plug or with any USB port! Once plugged in it gives off a red glowing "X" for each battery pack being charged! When charging is complete the "X" glows green! I was happy to find out that the packs allowed for extended playing time well over 20 hours! The pack snaps easily into the battery space in the Xbox One controller. It is very nice to have 3 additional packs charged up and ready to go to ensure that play is not interrupted!
5,To start it looks like it does in the picture. Charging pad feels lightweight and hollow. The (4) battery packs fits an xbox one controller perfectly. I used it for a couple hours and did not have any issues. Battery stays charged for hours of play and it comes with 4 batteries so continuous play is possible.
5,I've seen quite a few of these battery packs online for my xbox controllers. They fit my xbox series x controllers perfectly. Plenty of game time and I also love the stand it comes with. Worth the money forsure.
5,Worked perfectly for my son's Xbox one. No complaints easy to assemble. Charges fast and stays charged
1,Ordered this battery pack set a little while back and I cannot believe this is still for sale on Amazon. When it arrived one battery pack wouldn’t charge so I thought it was just one bad pack and I’d be fine with three. After about a month I have one pack that works and holds about a 2 hour charge. Utter waste of money.
2,Worked great for the first few months then one by one they stopped recharging. The podium thing would be green even when the batteries were completely dead.
1,3 batteries stopped charging/working after a month of use. All 4 have completely stopped working.
5,Cool charger plenty of battery capacity everything is perfect
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 These batteries have been great and are still going strong for me. I'm a pretty heavy gamer.so on average I'd say I use my gamepad 50 hours a week. The batteries last around 15-20 hours of use before having to recharge and they only take about 3 hours to recharge.Specially It looks like a spaceship very much  .There is a cool ‘X’ logo that projects underneath each battery as a charge status indicator.You really can't ask for a better kit than this. Use one battery when it runs out pop it out put it in the charger and replace it with the charged one. Never have to skip a beat
5,Like the charging. Dock nit charges up to 4 battery packs. Which like us  with two controllers it nice to have spares
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The charger comes with two 2600mAh Rechargeable Battery Packs.The batteries are rated at 2600mAh and do seem to last around the same time as my 2800mAh batteries I usually useBattery life seems to be around about 20 to 25 hours which is extremely goodFour batteries is always charged so I can quickly swap when I need to. It is convenient to simply plug a pack in and not have to deal with individual batteries
5,Great price for what you get. Works great!
5,Great product batteries have great life and the charger is really cool looking at night with the LED’s
5,Battery life is good. Packs are lightweight. Overall good product for the price.
5,It freaks out when I charge all four packs at once but other than that its great.
5,No detener el juego en un momento importante.
5,Good product just wish I could buy batteries separately also just in case one breaks I don’t have to buy a whole set
