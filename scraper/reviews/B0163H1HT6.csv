5,[See UPDATE 2016-11-02]Others have written here that the Type Cover for Surface Pro 4 is substantially better than earlier Type Covers and I agree. I'm using it on my Surface Pro 3 and it worked from the moment I attached it with no reboot or other actions necessary. The backlight and key action are both very good. It perfectly protects the Surface’s display as did its predecessors and can act like a partial tablet sleeve but one that isn’t an extra accessory you have to set aside whenever you use the computer. My only wishes are:1. That the keys had a "cup" design like the keys on the IBM Selectric and high-end keyboards but obviously not as deep;2. That the key finish was textured hard plastic. The key finish on this keyboard accumulates fingertip oils to some extent and looks messy after a while though nowhere near as bad as the earlier Type Covers.Wishes aside THIS IS A GREAT KEYBOARD FOR A GREAT COMPUTER.UPDATE 2016-11-02: I broke my SP3 by picking it up with two fingers pinching along the top edge near the front and rear camera lenses. The display cracked at the front microphone and the crack eventually spread all the way across the screen. I think this is a design flaw – you should be able to pick up the tablet at any point the same way you pick up a paper notepad. That said I’ve probably picked it up along the edge that way sometimes in the past without damaging it; don't know why this time was different. The SP3 started acting up after it was damaged with extremely slow boot times and other unacceptable operational issues. Of course the damage occurred exactly six weeks after my Accidental Damage Protection Plan expired. I've read that it's basically impossible to fix a Surface Pro so I scraped up enough $ to replace the SP3 with a new Surface Pro 4 i5/8GB/256GB. Far out! The keyboard predictably works flawlessly with the new SP4. I wish now I’d bought the keyboard with the fingerprint sensor which wasn’t supported by the SP3.OT: Yeah this review is ostensibly about the keyboard but I want to mention the Surface Pro 4. The SP4 with the i5 CPU is a snappy fully-fledged computer. The OS is Windows 10 with which I have a few grievances though not enough to warrant installation of an earlier OS (i.e. Windows 7 IMO Microsoft’s pinnacle OS). That might not be easily possible with this machine anyway. In today’s PC environment I don’t usually change the OS with which a PC is delivered figuring that’s the OS for which the device was most extensively tested.I can *simultaneously* run full Photoshop full Microsoft Office iTunes Chrome with several tabs open and miscellaneous other applications. The SP4 handles this relatively significant workload without much complaint (the fan runs) almost as well as my loaded i7 machines. To reiterate these are full-size Windows programs running in open resizable windows not pathetic impotent buggy serial “apps.”SUMMARY: I hope Microsoft continues to produce the Surface Pro and Type Cover form factors. The Surface Pro’s flat kickstand is a blend of design brilliance and implementation magic that is the best such solution I’ve seen superior to others’ inadequate folding displays docks and disparate little stands. The tablet is nicely flat unlike those tablets that are curved wedged or otherwise not completely flat. When the keyboard is detached you have a real tablet distinct from the convertible tablets that just look like laptops with their keyboards missing. The Type Cover complements the computer and is so easy to attach and remove that it never gets in the way i.e. you don’t have to ditz around lining up the connection points simply hold the cover near the bottom of the display and it magnetically aligns and “grabs” it with a confirmatory click.If someone had described the Surface Pro 4 to me back in 1982 when I thought the Osborne was the ultimate PC I would have laughed. A tiny flat computer with a brilliant integrated color screen? 8GB RAM? Never feasible man! My first "PC" had 64KB (yes K) and its storage was a cassette tape recorder. And a 256GB SSD? What are you talking about? Is that 5.25-inch?I own other faster laptops but the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 with the Type Cover is my go-to computer.
5,This was a replacement. Works as advertised.
4,headline says it all
5,As a Microsoft original product this keyboard is the perfect match for a Surface. It snaps and fits like a glove. Started to work with full featured functionality straight from the get go. Simply perfect! It transforms the tablet into a laptop.
5,Works awesome.
5,I own a Surface Pro 3. I already owned the type cover made for the Pro 3 but then I saw that there was a newer one for the Pro 4 that remains compatible with the Surface Pro 3 model. I have always found the type cover for the Pro 3 okay. It did its job but was nothing to write home about. I figured it was worth a shot to try out the newer type cover to see if it enhanced my experience. I have to say I do not regret this purchase at all. This type cover is a massive improvement over the previous version.The keys are actually spread out on the new version. They also appear to stick up more than the keys on the other type cover. However because the keys all stick together on the old model maybe that is just giving me the allusion that they don't stick up as much. Typing on the newer model is much easier! It allows for a natural keyboard motion whereas with the old model I found myself making typos constantly because the keys were so close to each other. I have to correct my typing far less frequently with the new model. I can also type much faster with the new model. The feel of the keyboard is just fantastic and I honestly think it is preferable to the built-in keyboard on my HP work computer. The type pad is still a bit flimsy but it does feel sturdier to me than the previous model. I think the new type cover does improve the lap sitting experience.Overall visually the new one just looks nicer. Perhaps the back lit keypad gives it a more refined look not sure. The track pad is now improved with a glass surface. It's much easier to use and is also a bit bigger. The look of it just also adds to the keyboard making this one look less cheap. I bought this in the teal color and think it's a great shade. I am not someone who likes bright and flashy colors so this is perfect for those who like some color but not overwhelmingly bright ones.Personally I think this is worth buying. I am not sure how the price compares to other keyboards but for one specifically made for the Surface Pro devices it is a great asset to the Surface Pro. I have been using my Surface Pro 3 more since buying the upgraded keyboard. If you were someone with no type cover you should definitely give this a shot. If you were like me and already had an older model type cover I think this is still worth considering. For myself knowing I plan to keep and continue using my Surface Pro 3 for more years it was worth investing $100 to update the type cover.I have a few cons to point out but nothing major in my opinion. You do notice oils from your fingers on the keyboard. This is somewhat unavoidable as I notice this on most of the keyboards I use. Also it would be nice if the type cover had somewhere to hold your stylus pen. The build quality could continue to be improved upon for future models so it's less flimsy. But the actual keys feel very solid as does the track pad. Also it'd be nice if Microsoft included a type cover with the purchase of a Surface Pro since the majority of owners will want a keyboard. Overall I think this is a 5 star product and worth the money.
5,I'm typing my initial impressions on the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover and am impressed with the subtle changes that have been made to this very necessary accessory. In the first place I want to confirm that this fits the Surface Pro 3 exactly as it should with no discernible difference in fit from the Surface Pro 3 Type Cover that I had previously used. Some of the salient improvements include the different spacing between keys the improved stiffness of the backing and the larger trackpad below the spacebar.At first it hardly seems that the changes made to the keys could make a difference. After all the SP3 Type Cover and the SP4 Type Cover are exactly the same width and height (thus there is no additional space utilized in spacing out the keys). Yet I notice a change in the way the SP4 feels which personally affects how accurately I type and how comfortable it is to do so compared to the SP3 keyboard. One obvious difference is the gapping that is now present between the keys--the keys do not feel bunched together on a single plane as they once did but instead are raised above a lower "floor" in the keyboard (note that this does not add to the thickness of the cover itself).I was particularly looking to see if the SP4 Type Cover "bounces" as much as the SP3. It does not in my opinion. This appears to be an issue that Microsoft took note of and addressed in their latest iteration. The cover still has some flex but it remains very solid under my large hands as I pound on the keys. Overall my impression is that this typing on the Type Cover not as satisfying as typing on the very best laptop keyboards but given some time it may be hard to notice the difference.One last obvious improvement is in both the size and the surface of the trackpad. It is both wider and taller than the trackpad on the SP3 cover. It has a smooth glass-like surface (though I'm fairly certain it is not made of glass) and is very responsive. Sliding your fingers over it feels natural and there is a lot more surface area now to do multitouch functions with ease. Despite its increase in size it does not interfere with or register false clicks as I type. (In regard to its intuitive nature the cursor/arrow moves about halfway down the screen when moving your finger slowly from the top to the bottom of the trackpad. Moving your finger faster moves the cursor all the way to the bottom when covering the same distance across the trackpad.)As a bonus feature this keyboard sports an additional key. On the right side near the bottom just left of the arrow keys is a key with three lines inside a little box. Pressing it brings up the menu that corresponds to the right click of the mouse. You can do this by tapping the trackpad with two fingers simultaneously as well but this key provides another helpful means of opening that menu.The keyboard still lights up as before and though both Type Covers have a "Function Lock" key I never noticed it on the SP3 since it was off to the right. Now it has been moved over to the left next to the "Control" key (as it is on my old laptop) and I found this subtle change to be helpful.All in all this is a great (and necessary) addition to the Surface Pro 4 and there is much evidence to suggest that this is a useful upgrade for those who already have the Surface Pro 3 Type Cover especially if they do a lot of typing.
5,The internet lied to me; they said the Surface 2 Type Cover was compatible with the Surface 4. Well I couldn't get it to work at all! So when payday came I bought the new keyboard. And boy do I Iove it!This keyboard is even better than the Surface 2 Type Cover. I'm someone who types really fast on flat keyboards. And this is about as flat as they come without just becoming non-tactile. It has at least one of each key you need. The keys are illuminated just like the old keyboard. There's a definite difference in texture but I kinda like it. I used to glide my fingers across the keys while typing but there's more friction on this one. Keeps you from hitting the wrong key without noticing. The outside feels pretty much the same as the old keyboard and of course the size fits the laptop as opposed to the old keyboard which was a smaller size. In fact the keyboard helps with that really flimsy feeling that the Surface has; it's got so many hardware features that for it to be as light and thin as it is feels like you're gonna break it by breathing on it. So get this keyboard cover and that'll take away the pain. - The keyboard cover is very susceptible to coffee spills. If you get coffee on your keyboard cover make sure to panic and grab the paper towels immediately and then proceed to apply pressure with an irresponsible amount of towels to the surface of the keyboard until it turns a slightly darker color then place in front of a fan or something until it dries. It'll be fine. - The new keyboard has one of two "height" settings. One is the regular where it's sitting flat on the table and the other is slightly raised up using a magnet. I don't know why anyone would want this but I've found it's very useful when you're sitting on an uneven surface and still have to type like sitting up in bed. - The mouse trackpad is SO much better than the Type Cover 2. It used to be practically unusable. The new one not only works but is bigger and more compatible with modern gestures like two-finger scrolling zooming and hold-for-right-click. Feels nice on the fingers too. - Now you know how you have the F keys up top that double as some other kind of action and how you'd have to hold down the function key to toggle any of the F keys? Well you can still do that but now if you just tap the Fn key you can toggle it to where you can hit the F keys to do F1 thru F12 without having to hold the function key down. It's really useful for people like me who assigned hotkeys to the F keys. - That about sums it up; closing the cover still puts the Surface into sleep mode just like before. I got it in turquoise because I felt I should stop buying stuff in black all the time.
5,I’ve had this for a couple of months now attached to my Surface Pro 4 and I’m happy to say it’s working really well.  Pressing the keys gets an immediate response all keys are working trackpad is fine (although I rarely use it as I prefer the pen) connection to the SP4 itself is strong no fading in the color anywhere (I bought the teal).  In the interest of full disclosure I don’t use my SP4 every day.  Mainly on weekends for several hours occasionally during the week in the evenings and I’ve taken it travelling for a long weekend.  It’s not my “main” laptop due to the screen size but for travel and portability it’s great.  Please keep that level of usage in mind when you read this review.The most important thing for me in terms of usage is typing which feels very smooth very much like a traditional laptop and I have no problems with the size and layout of the keys.  I’ve used the keyboard in my lap and at a table without experiencing any ‘bouncing’ or movement and it seems very sturdy (especially when you consider how thin it is).  Aesthetically I love the color so pretty!  It also feels nice in my hands.  That seems like an odd thing to notice about a keyboard but it really does.  In terms of footprint of the keyboard it’s much slimmer than I expected surprisingly thin actually.  I had already purchased a (rather expensive Kate Spade) laptop pouch that fit the SP4 plus the pen just perfectly in fact it was designed for it and while adding the keyboard has obviously increased the depth of the device I can still use this case.One thing I have been surprised pleasantly about is that when I’m not using the SP4 I fold the keyboard cover over the screen and store in a laptop pouch and not once have I noticed keyboard marks on the screen when I’ve opened it up again.  That’s one thing that used to bug me about my old laptop – in certain light you could clearly see the outline of all the keys on the screen.  Pleased to say this doesn’t seem to be an issue here!The only real concern I might have in the future is about the corners of the keyboard since it is so thin.  Right now they’re fine but with extended use I imagine they’ll look less polished.  This is by virtue of their location of course so there’s not much that can be done about it.  Of course I haven’t knocked a star off for this because it hasn’t actually happened but I thought it was worth mentioning.
5,I bought the cheap blue tooth version and regretted it. Just buy the real deal.
4,Pros:The Surface Pro 4 Type Cover is a great improvement over the Surface Pro 3 keyboard cover.  The biggest drawback with the old keyboard was the size of the keys themselves.  The Surface Pro 4 keyboard now has keys that are wider and extend closer to the edges of the cover itself.  That means that people with "sausage fingers" have less mis-stroked letters.  The keys are now more closely spaced to one another and they have a better action.  The keys are also quiet when being used.  That is important for me as I am one of those people who takes notes on my laptop while in meetings. This keyboard is not a distraction to others.Cons: There are only two that I can think of.  The first is that the width of the mouse glide pad has been made wider.  With the way that I hold my hands I wound up moving the mouse around the screen while I was typing as they partially touched the edges of the pad.  Since I almost always use a mouse with the Surface I went into the system settings and selected a setting that turned off the glide pad when a mouse was attached (easy answer from Cortana).  Problem solved.  The second issue is more of a problem with the Surface itself but since both are made by Microsoft it is a "Surface environment" issue for me.  My expectation is that when I close the keyboard to the screen that they Surface will automatically go to sleep.  This doesn't always happen.  I have found my Surface is hot and has been turned on while in my laptop bag on more than one occasion.  This also means that I could find my battery run down when I arrive at my destination.  As a result I always manually put my laptop to sleep.Microsoft has done a good job engineering the Surface and accessories this keyboard included.  I have been pleasantly surprised at how much I have enjoyed this device.  I have liked it even better with this keyboard.  As both a Mac and PC user I see strengths in both environments.  If I had to ask Redmond for any improvement it would be for a more intelligent glidepad similar to the ones that Apple has incorporated into the MacBooks for several years.  But I also know that I am now starting to nit-pick and shouldn't expect everything.  Or should I?
5,Okay so to be simple about this....I didn't have any problem with the Surface Pro 3 type cover after five minutes with this new one in the Windows Store it made me feel that my current one was so much worse. I had no hesitation in purchasing this thing with no hesitation.It covers up the surface pro 3 (I only updated the Type Cover itself) with a little better fit too which no one has mentioned that I've seen in reviews also as it is attached with the magnets for the more natural typing angle it also doesn't go right up to the edge of the screen like the previous version there is now about 5 mm of spacing making it not feel as if the screen is being covered by the type cover. Another few features that are better are the addition of a print screen button and the function lock button has a light on it now like the caps lock button. Another worth while mention is that the keyboard now has 5 variances in brightness unlike 3 before.Like everyone else has said though both the track pad and keys/keyboard feel a lot better in every single way imaginable. The spacing of the keys along with the feel of their click partnered with their texture is better in every way. The track pad is just naturally better because of it's size and glass texture (because it is glass)The only 2 ways I could see them really improving on this again is making a slightly thicker one containing a battery they did this with the first 2 versions of the surface I would gladly take a few more millimeters of thickness for extra 4 hours of battery or so. Also if they made it so it could have blue tooth as well and worked detached from the surface. This keyboard would obviously be more expensive but I definitely miss the lack of a battery keyboard that could potentially make the surface an all day device.If you are wondering if updating to the keyboard rather than buying a whole new surface set up this will make you feel like you just got the Surface Pro 4 so don't hesitate and just do it plus you can sell your last version for $40-50 dollars on eBay or something of the sort negating some of the cost.I really have nothing negative to say about this new cover though you'll really enjoy it if you use either the keyboard or track pad on the regular.
4,I just recently received my SP4 with this type cover along with it and yes I wish they came together but besides that there are a few things about this product that are good and bad.First of all I want to say that this computer is fantastic and has met all my expectations but when it comes down to the cover and the protection to this computer it falls short. In the case of me dropping my SP4 on the ground during transportation the type cover would flop around and not protect the screen at all. I think that Microsoft should integrate this keyboard onto the SP4 so that it provides good screen protection and stays attached magnetically to the screen when closed. The big thing that I noticed right away was that if you were to hold the screen so that it was facing the ground with the keyboard attached to the screen the keyboard would flop down rather than staying attached to the screen. There are magnets that hold the keyboard in place by where it attaches on the bottom but towards the top by the speakers or camera there is nothing that holds it. Another thing is that they should make the back on the type cover more durable so that if it did fall it could protect it more so than it would with a soft velvety material. I think a nice carbon fiber design on the back with a resin fill would look great and feel great. This would allow people to feel like this type cover would protect and survive during a situation where the surface pro would fall.Besides these suggestions for the type cover the keys feel great and I don't feel like i'm typing on some low end keyboard. It's super light and I love the back lighting capability. I used to have a very bulky and heavy Bluetooth keyboard but I now no longer need it as this keyboard is quite versatile. I believe that if you have all the available surface accessories like the surface mouse keyboard and pen then you'll have a great time with this all round device. It has replaced my XPS gaming machine that I used to setup as a personal PC which had to be plugged in all the time and left me wanting more. With this device I have a feeling of accomplishment after searching hard and long for a device that can do it all for me.
5,This is the Microsoft NON BLUETOOTH keyboard that connects using the factory pin connector.  Beware of all of the knockoffs that use a bluetooth connection.
5,Academic work
5,Definitely worth it. Connects effortlessly and can be flipped behind the computer for quick tablet-mode access. Very nice feel beneath the fingertips types awesome. I love the little feature where it lights up when you’re typing but goes away when you’re idle.
2,It has worked well until the keys (not the mousepad strangely enough) stopped working last night: the worst timing as it stopped working when I had much work to get done before an out-of-town trip. I spent two hours trying to fix it part of the time with a Microsoft person on chat walking me through steps and finally finding out it was a hardware issue and the warranty is only one year. So although I bought it a couple of years ago they won’t replace it. Disappointing endurance for the product (I’m over 50 years old and remember when things were made to last AND have treated it nicely) and disappointing customer service (not surprising either these days) to not stand by their expensive product for more than one year…guess they know it’s estimated death time. And now so do I so I hope to find another higher quality option.
5,I had the original Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Type cover for my Surface Pro 3 and it was OK. When I heard that the Surface Pro 4 Type cover was backwards compatible with the 3 I was very excited. The original Pro 3 Type cover was fine and there wasn't anything to compare it to if you wanted a type cover for your Surface Pro 3 however the Pro 4 Type cover is leaps and bounds better than the original. I'll be recommending it as an upgrade to all of my friends whom I've convinced to get Surface Pro 3's. Many of my technical live production friends are hardcore Mac users and getting them to use a Surface in the first place was a bit of a stretch. Now I can remedy the one thing that we've all thought was a weak point - they keyboard! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU Microsoft for making these keyboards interchangeable. This was a very smart move for keeping earlier customers happy.Feel:I'd say that the feel is somewhat like a MacBook keyboard although I'd say it is a bit more "springy" than the latter. Spacing is perfect and I can generally fly pretty fast on my typing.Backlight:This is a wonderful addition to us live production tech guys who work in dark places and need keyboard lighting. It was one of the things that attracted me to the MacBook Pro in the first place!Trackpad:Feels great and gets rid of all of my annoyances with the Type 3 cover. Click is solid if you choose to use it otherwise the touch-tap is great. It does recognize a right click if you click in the far right lower corner. You can also choose to two finger tap to get a right click.Finish:The keys have a nicer font and finish to them than the Type 3 cover. I really like it if you can't tell! The suede-like back material on the keyboard is nice if you are like me and carry a second tablet (without a cover) in your bag. You can literally place another LCD screen right against this material and it will not scratch the other tablet.
5,Varían mucho los precios de acuerdo al color del teclado.  Es difícil conseguir nuevos en colores como el que yo compré.  Lo compré usado.  Estaba en muy buen estado pero me salió mucho más caro.  Si no importa el color es buena buscar opciones.  El teclado en sí es muy bueno y no pesa casi nada. Es muy cómodo de llevar y de usar
4,Better product than the Surface Pro itselfFrankly I think Bill Bellichik said it best non-verbally when he took the Surface Pro that NFL HQ required him to use during paly calling and vigorously threw it against the brick wall behind the bench.
4,I bought this for my Surface Pro 3 – online reviews said that it was a significant improvement over the previous edition. After using this for several hours I am inclined to agree.ProsRaised keys -- they are a little easier to find with more feedback when I type. My accuracy is significantly better with this keyboard than it was with the original Surface Pro 3 Type Cover.Stiffer – it feels about the same on a desk but there is a big dfference when "lap typing". The Surface Pro 3 keyboard always felt a bit flimsy and it was "bouncy" when I had it on my lap. This keyboard feels much more substantial and is much firmer. Again my accuracy is better.The Trackpad – it is larger and smoother. Online reviews I have read indicate that it is more accurate; I never had a problem with accuracy on the old one so I have not noticed a difference in there. But the larger service area makes it more pleasant to use.ConsThis keyboard like the last one seems to show dirt and oil more quickly than other keyboards. I find I need to wipe it down regularly to keep it from looking embarrassing.Like the last one it needs to be attached to the computer in order to work. There are a lot of situations – airplanes come to mind – where I wish I could separate the keyboard from the tablet and still use it. Bluetooth would be nice.There is no hinge keeping things in place. This means you cannot just pick it up by the keyboard the way you could with a "real" laptop. You have to train yourself to hold both parts so that the computer does not just flop down and smack the desk when you pick it up.
5,Just over a month ago I purchased my first Surface pro 3 and fell in love with it. It really is a powerful device and fits my needs perfectly. Then when I heard the Surface Pro 4 was unveiled I was ecstatic to learn that the new type cover would work with the Surface Pro 3. First and foremost let me state that I had zero issues with the older Surface Pro 3 type cover (Black type cover in pictures). Sure the touchpad was too small to be effective however I used the touchscreen 99% of the time so that was a non-factor. And the keys were cramped making me feel like I was typing on a laptop from 2007 and the cover itself was slightly bendy when typing however I thought this was a minor tradeoff for having such a slim form factor.The surface pro 4 type cover solves these minor issues while keeping it's original footprint. Gone is the small useless trackpad. Gone is the cramped keyboard layout. And gone is the structural weakness of the type cover itself. Microsoft introduced a glass trackpad that is 40% larger than it's predecessor which actually allows for multi-gesture inputs to be useful. Also included is a more island-style chicklet keyboard layout with more conventional travel. The type cover itself is more structurally sound in that when you type away there is no more bending and overall the cover feels more sturdy and durable.  This is definitely a new and improved type cover. I would go as far to say this type cover is just as good as any MacBook keyboard and trackpad (coming from a long-time Mac user). Yes it is that good!The type cover works seamlessly with the Surface Pro 3 as advertised however I had to update my Surface Pro 3 in order for the driver to operate so keep that in mind.I would recommend this to any Surface Pro 3/4 owner...even if you already have a type cover. This is not a minor evolution (like the surface pro 4 itself) it is a complete and necessary revamp of a great product. This type cover allows the device to become what Microsoft set out for it to become. It allows the Surface Pro to become a bonafide laptop. I highly recommend it.
2,I have bought 4 of these now for my surface pro's.  They fail everytime within 13 months.  This last one was 20 days outside of warranty the last one was 7 days out of warranty.  I have to buy a new one every year.  First the keys start being slow to respond then the mouse pad quits working and finally the whole things stops working.  Unfortunately it is the one I need as I can't use a bluetooth one due to interference with other devices.
5,Arrived quickly and in great shape.
5,When I bought a Pro 4 my original intent was having a powerful Windows-based tablet I could take with me pretty much anywhere and it achieved that easily.  When I bought the type cover it also made me almost never turn on my desktop except for when I need to work with multiple media devices at once (Surfaces excepting the Book have only one USB port without the dock).The keys are comfortably spaced apart in a manner that's similar to the natural space between keys on a regular keyboard.  However if you're coming from a laptop that has the keys placed very closely together the spacing of the keys might take some adjusting.  Compared to the type cover for much older systems like the Pro 1 and 2 this is a vast improvement (but not backward compatible).In terms of logic in key placement and function it's pretty solid.  I enjoy that it remembers (or rather probably flipping a registry) when I set the FN key to active - thereby making the F keys operate as themselves and not some other mapped function like vol -/+ etc..  The back light on the keyboard is also nice for when in darker environments though I have not found if it's possible to dim it to your comfort.  What is comfortable is being able to snap the keyboard between the connector to the tablet and the keyboard so it sits at a slight angle like a regular keyboard.  This might be uncomfortable if you're propping the tablet and keyboard on your lap but your own mileage may vary.Some people may notice there is also a variant of this cover with a fingerprint scanner.  I'm sure there are useful applications of the fingerprint scanner but for me I had no necessity for it so forgoing that for a cheaper type cover was an easy decision.
5,I don't write a ton of reviews but I had to write one for this keyboard on this keyboard even if I've only had it for a few days now. I have a SP3 and have never been satisfied with the keyboard. Even if it was loads better than the SP2 touch keyboard the lack of space between keys made it hard to type without looking where I was typing. And the keys themselves were way loud too springy and felt cheap even if the keyboard was flat. I would end up doing all I could to avoid typing on it--even write in my text with the pen...which is pretty fun I admit even if it's slow.That was before I spilled Coke on it. But I'm glad I did because it gave me an excuse to get this one. (Thank you subconscious!)Let me just say: The keyboard on this thing is GREAT. It actually feels like a real laptop now. I don't confuse keys and it's a lot quieter. It's really a joy to use my SP3 for typing and not just for drawing. It also is a lot more sturdy as some have mentioned and feels of the same quality as the SP3 itself. If you hate the SP3 type cover keyboard find an excuse to get this one instead.Now the SP3 touchpad. Wow. What a hot mess.It's so terrible unresponsive that I've wondered if I had a defective model. I don't. It just sucks.But with this type cover no longer do I feel like I have to almost scratch the touchpad to get a response. The glossy surface responds so much better especially to multi-touch gestures. It feels like I'm using a high-end laptop. Again build quality is very much on par with the SP3 itself.Just gonna re-emphasize what others have already said: If you have an SP3 get this. It completely breathes new life into your already-awesome machine.
3,It has all the nice features I like. My experience with 2x surface pro's in 3 years are one completely died out of warranty one touchpad died out of warranty and still being used as keyboard only and one touchpad died within 6 months.The return process isn't pleasant either.1. 1st call asked me to upgrade windows version was a couple of releases off. The customer rep wouldn't wait with me  during updating process promised to call in 15 minutes and never did. Of course the update was done 10 seconds after the call ended. The unpleasant call time is about an hour mostly wait time.2. 2nd day call the same number  another rep asked to go to device driver and deleted anything surface or keyboard related. I complained about I have scan through like 60 items in human interface stuff. After reboot same drivers came back touch pad had no sign of life too. This rep ended the call after asking me to do the memory check. The call also took me one hour.3. I made the 3rd call immediate after ending the 2nd call and still running the memory check as I knew it's going to be a long wait time before I can talk to a live person. It's interested enough this guy could not find the track record with phone number and email addr. He did order the replacement without any further testing on my part. This time I did ask the case number and of course had no use of it. The phone call took another one hour.4. 3 weeks out of typecover.
5,Needed a replacement for my overused Surface Pro 3 keyboard and THIS IS IT..  what a difference a new MS keyboard makes.
5,Keyboard works great!! I tried two other keyboards to use with my surface pro that where junk.
5,Amazon did an amazing job at delivery with good packaging and delivery on time. It's been a month since I have used the Microsoft Pro 4 Type cover and it has turned out to be one of the best laptop/tablet keyboards out there. I have tried the old Surface Pro 3 type-cover and Microsoft has really improved in the terms of spread out keys easy to use controls really smooth and large touch pad and the stylish texture of the type-cover itself. The magnet is really strong and has held my Surface Pro 4 from falls when it slipped from my hands. The magnetic strip along the fold makes the keyboard even more stable and helps when I was using it on my lap or unstable surfaces. Furthermore being a student I have been using the Surface pro 4 on my lap small desks and other uneven surfaces and have had no ergonomic issues. The cover also acts as a protection for my surface Pro 4's screen and a frictional surface by attaching it other way round to prevent the surface from sliding when it's hinge is all the way up by as I do when taking notes on my surface. The Type Cover has also been durable and easy to clean in instances of small liquid spills (Happened to mine once) or dust. The backlight of the cover are also good with multi-brightness mode which are neither too bright nor too low (Clear at night not to harsh on eyes). To sum up Microsoft has done a really good job at the new Type Cover 4 and I would recommend this to not only Surface Pro 4 users (duh) but also to Surface Pro 3 users.
5,This is amazing quality. Yes you can get a Bluetooth keyboard for cheaper and yes it should be bundled with the surface and yes it may be overpriced for a keyboard but it is just such great quality. Very rigid and makes a great screen cover. The feel of it is just amazingEdit: That was my original review of the keyboard with only getting to use it for a few days. I am currently finishing up a 12 page paper which means lots of typing and after this I wish i could give it more than 5 stars. This keyboard is just perfect. I feel like I can type much faster on this keyboard than any other one I've ever used. The cover is quite rigid but not completely. It is not flimsy by any means but it has just a tiny bit of spring to it. That small amount of spring makes typing on it feel almost magical. I just want to keep adding more to this review simply because I love typing on this thing. The material it is made from is super soft which feels nice on your wrists if you want to rest them on the keyboard to the sides of the touch pads a little bit. I know for maximum ergonomics and what not you're not supposed to rest your wrists on anything but everyone does it and when you do with this keyboard it feels very nice. If i have anything else to add to this review I will add it in later.TL;DR: Perfect keyboard and a must have for the surface if you want to type anything on it.
3,They did not mention Surface Pro 8 that should have been a clue for me. This will not fit a Surface Pro 8 also has no place for the new slim pen.  It does however look like a solid keyboard for the older style Surface Pro. I had no way to test functionality as it is not compatible with the SP8.Return was easy.
5,When I bought my Surface Pro 4 I didn't think that I would need a keyboard. It seemed like a frivolous purchase because I intended to use the tablet to draw. I have fibromyalgia so getting a good grip on a pencil for an extended period of time is really difficult. However I had no idea how powerful the tablet would be and how often I would use it like a laptop!I ordered the keyboard right away and now I can't imagine ever going without it. The trackpad is nice so that you don't get fingerprints all over your screen and there's a specific button on the keyboard to select the brightness level of the backlit keys. It's great when you're using it in a dark room so you can dim the keys so that they're not really bright in your face but you can also see what you're doing.The only thing that I don't really like about it is that if your keys get enough finger grease on them (that's gross I know) and you leave the keyboard flipped up on the screen for a while when you open it and view it from the side you can see the outlines of the keys on the screen. Almost like a burn-in image on a plasma TV but at least this is easily removed with a microfiber cloth. That is probably mostly my fault for not cleaning my hands before using the keyboard.All-in-all no matter how much you like having a touch screen nothing can beat a physical keyboard when you're trying to get things done efficiently.
4,The keyboard on the new type cover is much improved from the old one. It feels and looks like a premium device. There is a sort of rubbery texture to the individual keys. Its just enough to achieve a nice firm grip on the key with your finger but not enough to feel weird or distracting. Its quite elegant feeling. The chicklet key spacing is a vast improvement. I'm not a great typist and could never achieve any real accuracy on the old type cover. Its a little thicker but much more firm. Its a welcome trade off. I find it much more usable in the lap. The old board would bend slightly when on the lap. I do not detect any bend in this one.The trackpad while improved is not great. The old track pad was unusable. It was not accurate and gesture didn't work well. This one is much bigger and much more accurate. The only problem I have with it is two finger scrolling is not consistently good. It works well most of the time but sometimes it doesn't seem to recognize my gesture for a split second. While it doesn't sound like a big deal its annoying.Over all this is a much better keyboard. It feels looks and works better. It is a 100 percent improvement and fells much more like a premium device.  I will certainly be keeping this one and would recommend anyone with a pro 3 like myself to upgrade.
4,The type cover is really a necessity in my mind to go with the SP4 and it would be nice if it was included but most tablets/2-in-1's don't include it so that's just the way it is.  As the product itself goes it does a good job of connecting itself more or less - whenever you get the SP4 close it will attach magnetically so that is super easy.  The back/underside/whatever you want to call it has a nice soft feltish feel to it.  I have read that this version is much more rigid and easier to type on than the previous version but to me it is still a little flimsy.  It's not that bad and you get used to it and I'm sure some sacrifices were made to keep it thin and light.The keys are back lit and you can adjust the brightness of the lighting.  The track pad is quite responsive to both movement and tap clicking.  There is also a feature that you can press the bottom right corner to execute a right-click.  The keys are well spaced out with the exception of the backspace button.  I can't ever seem to reach it when I'm typing and I end up hitting = several times.  Maybe that's just me.Overall I recommend it because it really is a necessity and they did a pretty good job with these.
4,I purchased this for my Surface Pro 4 so I haven't tested this on the Surface Pro 3. I haven't heard of any problems with the SP3 though.It's a bit uncanny. I decided to switch to a SP4 from a MacBook Air and one of my main concerns was the keyboard--I've worked with some pretty bad mobile keyboards in the past. I shouldn't have worried. The keyboard feels like it was lifted right off my MacBook Air. You can tell the keys apart easily they are very responsive and they even have that satisfying click whenever you press down a key. The noise is a big help: with other mobile keyboards the sound of hitting a key and hitting the table is about the same and my typing can get a little... funny.The four star review comes from the touchpad. It's better than the SP3 but still has a way to go. Its responsiveness when dragging the cursor is fine but it takes a little while to respond to any other gestures (which is especially frustrating with scrolling). The responsiveness is different than other touchpads so be sure to give yourself a day or so to adjust to using a little more pressure. This may be a software issue rather than a hardware issue so this may improve.EDIT: Commenter Maximilian Öttl helpfully says: "You should turn off the pinch to zoom gesture in the settings. Improves the responsiveness of the trackpad a lot."
3,I bought this to upgrade my Surface Pro 3. Like others have said the original Surface Pro 3 keyboard was okay but a bit hard to type on and the track pad wasn't great. This keyboard is a significant improvement and you can actually type with this thing. But $130 to upgrade a barely one year old and already expensive device just so you can type efficiently is a bit steep. Also one of the reasons I wanted to upgrade my type cover was to gain the fingerprint log on feature of the Surface Pro 4. I was disappointed to find no such fingerprint pad on this keyboard. That was my fault for not reading carefully enough to see that the fingerprint pad comes on an even more expensive version of an already overpriced keyboard. I can't justify an additional $60 just so I can log in with a finger so I will keep this one.I'm using this type cover with the Surface Pro 3 docking station. I notices another reviewer had problems with their type cover staying at an angle when docked. At first I had the same problem. The problem was due to the stiffness of the hinge as it came out of the box. After flexing the hinge a few times I was able to get the keyboard to hold its angle while docked. But it doesn't stick as tightly as the original Surface Pro 3 type cover does. I don't often use the keyboard when the device is docked anyway so it isn't a big deal.Overall this is a very nice type cover and a nice upgrade. But a very expensive upgrade. I might be more forgiving had my original type cover been included with an already expensive although very nice device. But having already shelled out $130 for a barely adequate keyboard and track pad and now an additional $130 is too large of an investment to make my Surface actually meet its potential as a laptop. If the price were half what it is I would have given it a 5-star rating.
2,The edges started to fray early on into having this keyboard but at this point the trackpad/attached mouse has completely decayed.
5,Some have complained about the type cover being sold separately but the huge benefit is that you get to choose your color. A friend of mine has a black type cover so I got red so we could tell them apart.When closed the cover has a very nice suede-like look and feel to it. The keys are responsive and when folded around back it doesn't cover the camera.There are drawbacks however. It has some flex which doesn't feel quite as nice as a solid keyboard. There's no middle-button function on the trackpad and no numeric keypad to the side which are important for one program I use but I'm not going to knock off any points as the size requires such compromises. You can't use it when tilted to portrait mode. It's so close to the bottom of the screen that it's hard to tap on anything down there. If you're drawing on your tablet an attached keyboard will push the screen away from you and make it harder to draw while keeping the keyboard at hand. For all these reasons I will probably get a wireless keyboard(or grab the larger keyboard from my desktop) but your needs may vary.An attached keyboard that doubles as a cover is definitely useful and all the drawbacks are merely a side effect of it being an attached keyboard that has to conform to the size of the tablet. Except the flex which isn't really much of a drawback.
5,I bought this for my Surface Pro 3. I had the type cover 3 before this so it will be replacing it. The type cover 4 is overall better in every way than the type cover 3. They're both roughly the same size with the type 4 weighing slightly more. The main difference is the spacing of the keys. The bezel on the type cover 4 is thinner than the type cover 3 allowing the keys to be more spaced apart. This allows the keys to be more separated and accentuated making it easier to feel and locate the keys and easier to type without accidently pressing another key. The other key difference is the touchpad being bigger to allow more range or movement. The key travel seems to be about the same but with the more space and accentuation of the keys it may feel slightly more on the type 4. Overall I'd say it's a good upgrade over the type cover 3 if you type a lot for work or school. Not so much if it's for personal or home use keeping in mind that the type 4 is $130 and the older type 3 is more affordable at roughly half the price (how much I got mine for). The back of the type 4 also says "Microsoft" while the type 3 says "Surface."Pros:- Easier to type and feel the keys.- Keys are more spaced apart.- Has extra buttons.- Bigger trackpad.Cons:- Wish it came with standard fingerprint sensor.
5,Tech and Toys delivered the Type Cover 4 earlier than expected. I was very pleased with the ship time. It's brand new so it arrived in the packaging you see in the photos.I had to exchange my Type Cover 3 since it was out of warranty and several keys on the right side of the keyboard were not functioning. Yes I went online and used various methods to troubleshoot the issue (even used rubbing alcohol on the connectors) however nothing worked.I bought the Type Cover 4 since it is compatible with the Surface Pro 3. As soon as I connected the keyboard it took seconds to update and then I had to power down so the updates could take effect. The keys are quieter have more space between them so you don't hit other keys when typing and the key pad has a lower profile where it connects to the surface to allow you to touch/open the apps/browsers in the bottom tool bar. The touch is more precise and is has a much smoother flow. Yet when you click the touch pad it sounds the same as a the old Type Cover 3. I can type with the Surface and Type Cover on my lap without any issue.I did not purchase the fingerprint reader since it was more expensive and unnecessary for my needs at this time.Overall I'm very happy with the Type Cover 4.
5,I saved almost 35% by buying used like new.  Looks new functions like new.  The keyboard is good but really there's no excuse to advertise the surface device with an essential accessory only to not include it in the final sale.  I was very happy to save hundreds of dollars by buying the surface the keyboard and pen as like new.
5,At first I didn't think I needed or even wanted this keyboard. I already had a Bluetooth keyboard and thought that the $130 price tag was a bit much even if it did protect my new Surface Pro 3. However I decided it would be nice to have a keyboard that was readily attachable and had backlit keys and I caught it on sale. I just received it and am very happy I decided to go for it! It seems like this keyboard really makes the experience with the Surface.What better way to test the keyboard than write an initial review?*Beautiful color (I got the teal)- just as pictured.*Love the options for the backlit keyboard (and even the intensity is adjustable!)*The keys are spaced perfectly like a normal keyboard (the arrows are the only ones that are a bit weird but how often do you need to use those with a touch screen?)*The typing is actually pretty quiet.*I love being able to adjust the keyboard at an angle.*The touchpad is big smooth and very responsive. Left and right clicking works as well as the neat gestures you can use with it.*I like that I can slide my pen into the little indent in the front when the cover is closed.*It does smell like paint for some reason. I'm assuming that'll go away with use.
5,Great keyboard
4,Rated as a tablet keyboard this is fantastic. As a laptop keyboard pretty good.The pros are: It is easy to type on with good tactile feedback the spacing of the keys is good the touchpad works well even tough the thumb buttons aren't defined separately the soft surface keeps it from sliding easy when laying on the keyboard side. Attaching is easy and foolproof - I'm very impressed how well this works. It's easily folded behind the Surface Pro when you want to hold it like a tablet without detaching the keyboard. I also love that the keyboard lights up.The cons: There is some flex in the keyboard when sitting on your lap and typing though not much I worry that the soft finish (velour like) will eventually pick up dirt and be hard to clean and that the soft edges (feel like seams of soft plastic) may tear snag or fray over time.Overall I find I almost never take the keyboard off and rarely miss the sturdiness of a traditional laptop keyboard. The darker blue color still looks professional with just a little flair (I could never do the bright blue Microsoft always shows in Surface pics)
5,My previous cover had deteriorated over the 3 years since I bought it new. With this replacement my Surface Pro feels and looks like new again! Happy...
5,As ergonomic as a flat keyboard can be. Handier than using the onscreen keyboard.
5,The tablet keyboard has a soft texture. The keys work great. Overall great.
5,Got this used.  Showed up in perfect condition.  No problems at all and the price was awesome.  Glad I rolled the dice on used.  This seller seems alright by me.
4,Initially I really loved the Type Cover but after a few months the touch pad started registering false clicks. At first I thought I could just deal with it but it's become progressively more annoying and frustrating. I've gone through changing all the settings anything I could do on my end to try and fix it but it still jumps around. Two keys are also peeling back the protective layer which is more visible wear and tear than what I would expect for how long I've had it. I am very gentle with this product and no one else handles it but me. I had heard a lot of great things about the Type Cover but I've become very disappointed in it.EDIT: Customer support was excellent in helping solve the problem. The Type Cover needed to be replaced and they made the process extremely easy. I've had the replacement for few months now and it appears to be working as intended. I love the Surface Pro easily the best computer I've purchased so it's really great to have a working Type Cover now!
4,It does what it's supposed to do.  But I don't understand their choice in the material.I feel that within a year it will look rather frayed and have tons of stains that won't come off.And I am not about to buy another one bc it looks old - at least not at this price.If you buy a laptop you don't have to worry that in a year the keyboard will age 15 years while the laptop looks fine.In this case that's what I'm afraid will happen as certain areas are already showing signs of wear after 3 months.But aside from the that I love the keyboard feedback. I love the responsive feel and I find myself typing faster than with other desktop or laptop keyboards.Even with the small form factor it feels like any other keyboard.The trackpad is also very responsive.So apart from the fabric material (which looks ok after you wipe it with a damp cloth) and the price it's a great product.Much improved from the Surface 3 Keyboard.
5,Got it for my Pro 3 and it is great! I can echo all the 5 star reviews here in saying that the new KB is a huge improvement. I actually enjoyed typing on the old one just fine. It was pretty good for what it is being a super slim cover with a built in KB. But it always had the caveat of "for what it is". This new one feels as good or better than my fullsize Samsung laptop KB or my wired apple keyboard. I really enjoy typing on it and the key spacing makes it much more accurate for a crappy typist like me with fat fingers. The trackpad is likewise a great improvement with it now being much smoother and having enough room to actually use it more regularly. It works much better with multi-touch gestures and I can now use it for more accurate pointing where I previously would switch to an attached mouse more often. The only minor gripe I have is that I wish they used a smooth surface on the back instead of the soft fuzzy material as it tends to look dirty after a bit and is harder to keep clean. Overall well worth the money to upgrade and I would recommend it to all SP3 owners.
5,This is shockingly good. Never before have Microsoft gotten it right -- and now they have. A keyboard with great key travel and spacing wonderful tactile feedback backlight and a responsive trackpad that supports Microsoft Precision Touchpad for gesture control.It's fairly thin and has a wafer-like design. It does not bend easily (thank goodness) but depressions and indents can form on the edges. It has a wonderfully fuzzy feeling on the outside after some time but is otherwise amazingly durable (considering I've put mine through a lot since I got it shortly after release).This fulfills Microsoft's promise of making a real laptop out of a tablet. Well a very specific tablet no doubt...Some nitpicks:- Not easy to change the backlight setting from the keyboard itself- Rarely poking the tablet through the touch cover can register a screen event (touch) when it is closed and projecting to an external monitor- A little pricey for a keyboard -- though it's more than a keyboard; it's a de facto case touchpad and mini-dock (because it adds a peripheral without using up a general purpose port)- Slightly heavier than expected although the combination of keyboard + tablet is still better than most ultraportable laptops
5,Keys are spaced better than original for Surface Pro 3. Only annoyance is regularly asked if I want to turn on sticky keys when moving lots of pictures. Will find the off settings for "helpful hints" and adjust accordingly.  Really like the keyboard. Old one broke and am glad it did. This is much better.
5,I love typing on this keyboard and like that the keys are back-lighted when needed. It is also a good protector for the screen when folded to the closed position. I ordered the teal colored one which I think it looks more professional than some of the brighter colors.3/31/17:I still do like this keyboard but after just about seven months of use while typing it abruptly stopped working. I purchased a new keyboard/cover and after arrival I found it's keys wouldn't type either. While thinking about this development I was holding down one key and it started to type the letter slowly as did the other keys. I snapped on my old keyboard and it did the same. I started checking settings and found under the "Ease of Access" Keyboard the Filter Keys option had somehow turned on so now everything is once again working fine and I have an extra keyboard. I do have one disappointment and that is the "Alt" keys will not allow one to input something like Alt + 248 which should put a "°" degrees symbol on the screen and I have yet to find a way to use any memorized ASII symbols or special characters.....which really sucks.
5,I bought it for my husband for Christmas  he really liked it.
4,I have purchased two of these they do not hold up well. The first one had keys failing within about three months. I was sad about that but opted to order this one thinking my first experience may have been a fluke. Happily the price had dropped substantially and I saw that it had a one year warranty. This one worked for about 4 months and then the trackpad failed. I sent the request to return it and was directed to their return policy page.  Yeah they aren't going to fix or replace this. If you opt to buy one of these I would add on the Amazon protection for it because otherwise you will be replacing it out of pocket over and over.***Update*** After writing this review (see comments) I reached out to Microsoft. It took 2 1/2 hours on the phone but I got a free replacement for the broken one. Fingers crossed that this one lasts. If it fails within 1 year I will update again.
5,The perfect complement to the SurfacePro 4. This keyboard is nice to touch and feel. It doesn't feel cheap. The SurfacePro3 keyboard is another story. Terrible tactile keys on a rather poorly designed accessory.There is another version with a fingerprint sensor and another one with Alcantara (fake plastic leather/suede) feel. Don't waste your money on those two because it just doesn't make any sense to use them. The Alcantara is a light grey version of the original for an additional $30 more. Microsoft does a great job on focusing on the aesthetics and comfort for their accessories. I still think this should be included with the SurfacePro device by default. It makes for a nice pair. The keyboard is great to use and especially at low light conditions because of the nice led back light. The only thing I wish there was on this was the ability to lock the keyboard to the SurfacePro rather than just snap with the rare earth magnets. There could be times that you may want to grab the SurfacePro4 with the keyboard but be careful because it is not recommended! Overall I highly recommend the keyboard for your SurfacePro pleasures.
5,Bought this for my wife's Surface Pro could ring myself to paying full price.  It was clean and in near mint condition.  Seller was great and the product even better.
5,I purchased this keyboard as an upgrade to replace the previous model for my Surface Pro 3. This keyboard is 100% compatible with Surface Pro 3 for anyone who is concerned about that. All letter and function keys work and the addition of volume up/down keys are a welcome improvement over last years model. There are no dedicated keys for screen brightness but there is a work around for this you can use. Holding the fn key and then pressing del/backspace can be used to change the screen brightness up and down. The quality and feel of the keyboard has been improved immensely. The keyboard does not flex when typing and the keys have good key travel. Typing on the SP4 keyboard feels exactly the same as typing on any other regular laptop. It does not at all feel like you're typing on some cheap third-party tablet keyboard like the previous model did. The track pad has also been improved. It is large enough to use comfortably and has a nice smooth and hard surface. If you are considering upgrading to the new type cover just do it. Microsoft finally got the type cover right with the newest iteration. I highly recommend this product.
5,I have a surface pro 3 and the keyboard that was distributed for the surface pro 3. This keyboard was a great upgrade from that keyboard. This keyboard has chiclet-style keys with space between them so that the touch typing experience is much closer to that of a laptop. The surface pro three keyboard has a flat surface and the keys are all level without margins in between them. The one place where the surface pro three keyboard is better than this one is that there is less transfer of debris from the keys to the screen when the system is closed. This keyboard still doesn't provide enough heft or ballast so that those of us with short legs can use the surface as a laptop but it still provides a laptop-like experience when working on a table or desktop surface.I am using this keyboard to type the review while working on a treadmill desk. The mouse/touchpad is not as responsive I would like but I am not sure whether that is a device issue or a user issue because I still have tablet mode enabled in the operating system.
5,Definitely works perfectly with the surface pro 4. I was able to use a regular old keyboard that had a USB hook up but i wanted something more portable.Something you cannot tell from the picture is the outside or "Case" Part is kinda fuzzy and soft? Suede-like if you will. So if you're wanting to put stickers on it or think it might be hard plastic it's definitely not. The keyboard is ever so slightly squishy. So while it's a great screen protector I would think you're still going to want a solid case if you're travelling.I like that you can set it up flat or kind of tilted thanks to the magnets and the keys are backlit which is really nice. And they feel about like a normal laptop so they're super comfortable to type on. I've been using it for a little while now and the only hang up is sometimes you'll need to disconnect it and reconnect it. It's not always 100% hooked up and ready to go but that's been pretty rare for me so far.
4,Pros:Essential to enjoy the full Surface experiencePremium feelGlass trackpad is a joy to useThe keys are sturdy and the material on them feel great on my fingers.Good backlightingCons:Could be cheaperMaterial prone to little scratch marks and dirt but can be wiped off with a wet paper towel.I got this for my Surface Pro 3 and I can tell you it's much better than any other Surface keyboard you can buy.  This Type cover is a almost flawless keyboard experience and the trackpad is the best of any Windows PC (other than Surface book's).  Easy to access back-light controls are handy and the keys and glass trackpad feel and look very premium. It's very good screen protector and the magnets are sturdy.  The only things I don't like about it is that it's not included with the Surface and it's a bit pricey but worth the money. The material looks and feels great but it's prone to scratching so be careful.
5,If you have a Surface Pro this keyboard is essential. If you have the docking station a regular USB keyboard is probably better especially if you do a lot of tenkey. But if you move around a lot this is the keyboard for you.The feel of this keyboard reminds me a lot of the MacBook keyboard. I have a MacBook Pro 2012 which is shaping up to be Apple’s last good MacBook. The keyboard continues to be my favorite aspect of the MacBook. Whatever focus testing was done to arrive at the key placement Apple really nailed it and now MS has too. The buttons on this type cover actually have the click feedback that makes it feel like a mechanical keyboard which only serves to make this keyboard even better. I can’t say enough good things about this keyboard. I’m not even fussed about the price. Yes $120 plus is expensive for a keyboard but a good mechanical keyboard is more than that and this has similar qualities.Again if you have a Surface Pro this one is a no-brainer.
5,I bought a Surface Pro 4 intending to use one of those folding keyboard folios to carry it but found none that accommodated the Surface.  So I bought the Type Cover instead.  Good purchase.The keys have decent tactile feedback.  I was afraid this was one of those touch keyboards which I don't like.  But the keys actually have some resistance and "press" length so I can easily tell when I've typed a key.  The navigation keys (ie. arrows Home End Pg Up and Pg Down) are all dedicated which is good.  I bought a Logitech BT keyboard a while back where those required a Fn key to access.  For Web browsing by keyboard that SUCKS!This is a mobile keyboard so some of the key positions (outside of the top row numbers and the QWERTY letters) can take some getting used to.  But that's gone well for me so far.Cost is a big factor here but if you're already buying the Surface Pro is that a deal breaker?  Wasn't for me.
5,The keyboard works absolutely perfectly. The felt all around the keyboard feels natural and soft to the touch a vast improvement to their previous type covers. The backlit keyboard is nice and bright perfect for night typing. My favorite thing about the type cover is the superior touchpad. On all of my previous laptops I couldn't stand using the touchpad. I had to use a mouse. But the touchpad is remarkable. It captures your exact touches without being hyper sensitive like other touchpads. Two fingers up and down will scroll up and down. Most touchpads have a little section on the side you slide up and down to scroll and those are awful because those barely react properly and only give you a hard time. You can go back a page by sliding to the right with two fingers. Zoom in and out by pinching with two fingers. Three fingers sliding will bring up all your active windows and you can switch between them. There are so many functions that are not on other touchpads on top of it being perfectly calibrated touchpad. It's absolutely amazing.
5,I have tenosinivitis from typing on an old non-ergonomic keyboard so I was wary of this one.  It's small but actually not bad to use.  It helps that I can use the touch screen and don't have to do everything with the key cover.  For the first 2.5 years this worked really well.  Snapped on and off with no problems.  Only lately have I been having problems where the computer will not recognize that the key cover is in place.  Hard re-boot usually fixes that but it's a hassle.  I really like the back-lighting on the keys.  The keys themselves are very responsive.  Not mushy - real individual keys.  Light touches don't activate them (a good thing) nor do you have to pound on the keys.
4,I've gone through three typefaces over my four years of owning a Surface Pro 3 and this is my fourth. With each one two or three random keys would stop working. I'd heard that the typefaces compatible with the Surface Pro 4 last a decent amount of time and here I am. It's definitely sturdier than my previous type-covers and there's less space between the keys for pet hairs and dust to creep into. I'm hoping this will last multiple years.The only issue I have is that clicking can be troublesome - sometimes trying to right click will instead register as a left click. I also can't help but wonder if the price is appropriate for the product though I suppose that will depend on how long it lasts. If this lasts as long as the Surface itself I'll consider this money well spent!
4,Its pretty good typing this review on the keyboard. As a PC gamer who got the surface for school i am very use to a mechanical keyboard and formerly using a mac I'd have to say its a mix of the two. It has the size of the the mac keyboard and feel (though the mac can be cold to the touch or warm depending on use) but the mouse is my biggest complaint. When using the pen in power-point to take notes i accidentally press a button and it switches slides. AND while writing this review i accidentally clicked a few lines above what i was currently typing and started deleting my review on accident. The mouse click is a bit too sensitive but doesn't move around the screen as fast as the MX Master Bluetooth mouse I have.If possible get a different Bluetooth mouse and find a way to disable the track-pad mouse
5,I purchased it to replace an older one.
2,UPDATE: This keyboard is great in many ways-the typing is excellent as previously stated. The issue is with the touch pad-with my old keyboard all was good and the only issues I had was from wear. After a few days of use on this keyboard the touch pad keeps freezing when I try to move it making it impossible to work on projects without my mouse being connected. I searched the issue and found many people expressing the same thing-after doing a hard shutdown of my computer increasing the sensitivity of the touchpad and decreasing the delay nothing has fixed this. This is incredibly inconvenient especially since I can't work without the keyboard so I will need to order and receive another one before I can return this one-which I will be doing.I have the Surface Pro 3 and though I just received this but I already know this is going to be oceans better than the older keyboard! It was time for me to get a new one (as you can definitely see in the pictures) and as a student I use my keyboard a lot for long periods of time so I need a keyboard that is easy to type on. After typing a few papers on this one I know that it is going to be absolutely wonderful and a lot easier to type on due to the spread apart keys and the wider touch pad. I just hope the touch pad doesn't crap out like my last one-I'll update if it does!Only drawback is that the magnet strip that props the keyboard up doesn't work with my old case-no big deal since I was needing another one anyways but still a good thing to know since the UAG case is one of the most popular for the Surface Pro 3!
5,I got a surface pro 3 and decided to superman it with pro 4 accessories. This keyboard was a clear step up from the pro 3 keyboard with a larger trackpad and more space between the keys so that your hand is no longer crammed for space. The keys depress extremely well and definitely have the feel of a 'real' keyboard. The smooth glass trackpad has excellent sensitivity and scrolling clicking and trackpad gestures are all a breeze.The cover itself also works great to turn on/ off your surface. Remember that once the cover is open and the surface is setup like a keyboard you can slide the cover forward a bit towards the screen and it'll magnetically stick on and elevate the keyboard (this way you aren't typing completely flat).Also to ADJUST SCREEN BRIGHTNESS: Hit Fn + Del or Backspace. The sun buttons over the F1 and F2 keys are to adjust the keyboard backlighting.Hope this review helps! 5/5 and a must have for any surface pro owner.
4,This keyboard is as durable as it is thin. It has survived months of my cat jumping on it being moved and taken off the computer. It still shows no signs of wear all the keys work and it still lights up. All around it seems like it will last yearsMy one caveat is that the backside is covered in a fabric that imitates soft leather or something. It stains SO easily. You have to be really careful where you set this baby and forget about touching that side with greasy hands. The only way to clean it is with a damp cloth. On the plus side it seems to be very resistant to *dry* dirt nothing clings to it. I suppose I would describe my issue as the material being "grease absorbent". I am impressed with its ability to repel dry particles though.
5,A must have for Surface Pro users. I have been only using it for about two weeks but it as a person on the go everyday it has been an essential for anyone who needs to do work on the the Surface Pro.Pros: Sleek and perfectly sized for Microsoft Surface Pro tablets  Has in-keyboard lighting with adjustable lighting switch  No lag time between the keyboard and the tablet  Strong magnets allowing the keyboard to stick to the tablet even if you pick up the tablet and let the keyboard swing down  The keyboard itself doesn't need to be charge wirelessly as it was created to be connected to the tablet's battery through it's undersideCons: It's rather flimsy so a heavy key typer like me is scared about breaking the keyboard  The keys are rather small with each alphabetical and numerical keys being about 1.5 cm each key
3,I've been using this keyboard for a few months now with my Surface Pro 3. I bought it to replace my Pro 3 type cover that was getting unbearable to use.At first I really liked it. It looks nicer the key spacing is much more functional and I loved being able to use the scroll and zoom features on the touchpad which was impossible with my old keyboard. I did notice pretty quickly that if the touchpad had any sort of dust or oil on it at all the cursor would not move properly if at all. Then I started noticing that sometimes the multi-finger functions such as scrolling wouldn't work and I would either have to repeatedly disconnect and reconnect the type cover or just restart my Surface. Now just in the past week I've been unable to click with a soft tap instead of pressing down. When I just do the tap it and then move it it will either drag whatever I was trying to click or highlight text. This also happened with my surface 3 keyboard.After paying so much money to upgrade I'm very disappointed to see that some major issues are not fixed. I've hardly had any issue with the Surface itself but because of such fundamental issues with basic use of the type overs I may consider something else for my next computer purchase.
5,This makes a Surface 3/4 laptop replaceable! I bought into the hype last year when the surface 3 pro came out. I initially liked it but after spending some months with it I did not feel the surface pro 3 touch pad was usable for heavy typing so it was not capable of replacing my laptop. It was up to the point I bought an old hp laptop for work use. After seeing the video reviews of the touchpad for the surface pro 4 and wishing I waiting I stumbled on an article that mentioned it was surface pro 3 compatible. I tried it out at the best buy and it was indeed a night and day difference. I ordered it from amazon the next day. I'm currently typing this review with the touch pad and I love it! Now I can say my surface can replace my laptop with ease. This is a must have upgrade for surface pro 3 users! The new pen not so much I returned it after realizing its no real difference from the pro 3 pen.
5,This keyboard design is ingenious. I love the entire concept. The backing and the body of the keyboard is made of a soft felt material. The trackpad is smooth glass and works beautifully. The trackpad has a perfectly tuned response to touch and gestures. The tack tile keys feel amazing when typing. The backlight is bright enough to see the keys and can be dimmed to a low light. The keyboard is not flimsy when typing. The keys are spaced apart a little further from the predecessor and feels a little more like conventional laptop keyboard. It is surprisingly stronger and sturdier than what it looks like. The magnet connection is strong. So strong when holding the keyboard only with the surface still attached the surface will not detach (not shaking or tossing it around like a fool!). My associate bought the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Finger Print Scanner and I have seen the scanner works fast and without any issues. Microsoft hit it in the ball park with this generation of Surface Keyboards!
5,When trying to decide what laptop to purchase I went to a local store and tried out various brands as well as read many tech reviews.  After doing so I fell in love with this keyboard for the Microsoft Surface Pro and purchased it.  As a snap-on accessory I was surprised at how well it functioned and how durable it felt.  The keys are an ideal spacing and springy and the touchpad is very responsive.  Some online reviews complained about the smaller size of the touchpad portion but it didn't bother me at all.  Also liked that it comes in different colors (but wish Microsoft would bring back purple).One word of caution is be careful of the vendor you purchase from and make sure you are actually purchasing what is being advertised.  I suspect some vendors may be selling either used or counterfeit accessories.  The first "new" one I purchased was opened and didn't have a warranty so promptly called Amazon and had it replaced.
4,It started working immediately so no complaints there. Considering the issues I started having with the last one I'mm thrilled to be able to type the letter "w" or "a" without the letters "wa" appearing every time...The only drawback is that it's not "sticking" to the screen like I thought it was supposed to. Maybe that will come with more use and time??? Other than that the keyboard looks good. Has a nice big mouse pad keys are all backlit and even has an extra "Fn" key that the last keyboard was missing.
4,I bought this for my Surface Pro 4 and have been using it for nearly 2 months. While it is a very beautifully made keyboard the touchpad is frequently unresponsive unless I really press down on it or in some cases the sensitivity is uneven. I've searched for driver updates and other hardware issues but have not found a solution to this problem. If there was a way to increase the sensitivity of the touchpad I would definitely give it the high rating it deserves. 2/5EDIT: After sending in my Type Cover to Microsoft for repair/replacement I was very pleased that they sent a new one to me after reviewing my service request. Microsoft has stepped their game! I'm very pleased with the new unit I received. I have raised the review to 4/5.
5,On occasion we have had issues with our original Surface Pro 4 keyboard not working. But this time (September 2020) we simply could not get it working. Per the internet we tried cleaning the contacts with alcohol we tried various hard rebooting techniques - nothing worked. Other than this issue we really do love our Surface Pro 4. Finally I found this replacement keyboard. And since it was returnable we decided to try it. It immediately worked! Thank you Microsoft
5,What a difference this Type Cover makes. I wanted to breathe some new life into my SP3 so I bought this along with the SP4 pen (which is also amazing). I write a lot so the SP3 Type Cover left much to be desired as my error rates were significantly higher on a keyboard where the keys are literally touching one another. Not anymore.The extra space on the keys works wonders for typing and they have a much sharper response than before. They're less clicky and don't have that odd wobble on them that the SP3 cover has. It makes a world of difference. Also my hands can be spaced out a bit more than they would be on the SP3 model so I feel more comfortable typing.The touchpad feels amazing now that it's glass and has more room to maneuver. Overall this is an excellent upgrade for any SP3 user and a must-have for everyone else.
4,I bought my first keyboard in 2017 when i purchased my pro 4. I just replaced my old one because it started coming apart where it connects to the tablet. This new key is much sturdier. I have my pro 4 in a case but with this new keyboard I an mot sure i need the case. I am not sure how it will do on color aging over time but for right now the keyboard and the track pad are great. The track pad is much more responsive to all of the different swipe options available.
5,Works great! Absolutely love it ! Was skeptical from the pictures about the sturdiness but very surprised  how sturdy it is. Easy connect! Sturdy! Reliable! Love it no issues!
1,I purchased a surface pro 4 keyboard from them.  Once I installed it I found that it was not working.  Before I started a return I contacted Microsoft support directly to be certain that the keyboard was faulty.  Microsoft requested the serial number of the keyboard which I provided.  Microsoft said the warranty had expired over a year ago on this keyboard.  I then returned the keyboard.  The seller has not completed a refund and is non responsive to me or Amazon.  Amazon has made good on the refund.  Buyer Beware!
5,Type cover is nice. I use this with a surface pro 3 and it works perfect. The touch pad has good response the back-lit keys are nice key spacing is good good response from the keys meaning it feels like a standard keyboard and not some cheap plastic thing that will break in a week or month overall a good keyboard addition to the surface pro and very well made. I wasn't sure I would like it because I am used to a standard laptop keyboard and thought this would be bouncy because of the angle but the keyboard is not flimsy at all and has no bounce. It can be used flat or at an angle which works perfectly.FYI- If you do use it with a surface pro 3 it will fit with the UAG case. I wasn't sure it would because of the bottom portion of the case but it fits fine.
4,My sp3 type cover died on me after 4 years so I bought this new "surface pro" type cover. Glad to know it fits my sp3. I love the new spacing of the keys larger and smoother trackpad. I feel like the keys are a little loud and the back lighting of the keys aren't as bright. I also wish they still made the loop to hold my pen. Overall satisfied.
5,I'mm not sure how relevant the star ratings on the features are because there is no battery or sleep mode or touch screen. I really like the look and the feel of this keyboard though. At first I thought it looked really flimsy but it is surprisingly sturdy. The backlighting is a very nice feature when typing in dim light and the mouse pad is a nice size. The keys have nice travel and are very consistent. I would definitely recommend this keyboard for any Surface Pro users. (I am using a Surface Pro 7)
4,It seems like a great keyboard. I've only had it a week though so time will tell. The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the video that is posted with the pictures of the item shows that it has a fingerprint scanner/reader to unlock the surface so when mine came in the mail and I was setting it up I was looking for the fingerprint scanner and realized it does not have one. That was one of the main reasons I bought this keyboard instead of some of the others I was looking at. Amazon should probably remove that video because it is misleading. I probably would've bought the other keyboard I was looking at if I had known this.
5,I never understood the obsession with the glass trackpad on the MacBook series until now. The trackpad is great the keys are responsive the backlight is super useful. Even the function keys are well placed and we'll thought-out. My only complaint is that the backlight bleeds through the side of the key. Also I'm unsure how the felt will hold up over time. I use mine with my Surface Pro 3 and it works great with 100% functionality. I have noticed that occasionally when switching from tablet mode will occasionally stop the trackpad but if you put the PC to sleep and wake it back up the functionality is restore. Don't know if this is intentional or a software bug. Still it's much more usable than previous generation type covers. Worth the extra money despite reviews suggesting it should be bundled for free. If Apple can charge significantly higher for their junk attempt at the iPad Pro keyboard MS can keep doing what they're doing!
5,I finally figured out that I could buy a version 3 or 4 keyboard and it would work great with my new Surface Pro.And I found one that was only $38 for a surface 3 I think.  Instant connect better ergonomics.  Great solution glad I didn't have to pay $130 for a "new" model.
5,I was a bit wary about buying used or renewed products on Amazon but this type cover works perfectly. There were a few spots that you could tell it had been used but it cleaned up well with a little bit of soapy water on a cloth. It's functional as both keyboard and cover and can be flipped to just keep a better grip on my surface which I find to be a bit slippery without the cover. The price was unbeatable for a genuine Microsoft product shipping was fast and the product was as described.
5,Great keyboard! The keys work very well and are comfortable and responsive. They're also backlit which helps when you're working in the dark. The track pad feels and works great too although it took a while before I stopped accidentally right-clicking when I wanted to left click. Love the fact that you can set it up at a slight angle for easier typing and it can swing back behind the computer (and doesn't register key presses in that position) if you want to use it in tablet mode without removing it. Had to buy an additional case for the body but this keyboard protects the screen when closed too. MS has been great with their support recently and it's good to know that there's a 1 year warranty in case something goes wrong. My only criticism is that every now and again the keys/pad don't respond I bet that's a Bluetooth thing. Otherwise this keyboard is exactly what I was looking for.
2,This keyboard really is superior to the Surface Pro 3 TypeCover/Keyboard.  You can feel spaces between keys a bit better.  Unfortunately if you type a lot though this keyboard is still frustrating sometimes in new ways.- The Fn key is where the Ctrl key normally is located.  As a result you have to train on this keyboard to learn the new location and should minimize your use of more normal keyboards that would negate that training.- Alt+F4 is no longer a convenient key combination.  One must first tap the Fn key first.  You could leave it tapped.  There is a light on it to let you know it's activated but if you're a touch typist you won't see that and if you're getting the location of the Ctrl  and Fn keys confused you'll often (not) find that the Fn key is not activated because you accidentally hit it earlier trying to hit the Ctrl key.- The flat arrow key arrangement is not a disaster but it's still weak.- The Home End PgUp PgDn Ins Del arrangement is also not a disaster but also weak.Overall if you type much you're not going to find this keyboard is adequate.  All of the shortcomings I've mentioned above could be resolved by Microsoft to achieve roughly the level of keyboards one sees in the less expensive ThinkPad W500/510 serires.  Alas so far shoppers don't really have an alternative at this form factor.  You'll have to keep a not very portable full-sized full-function keyboard around if you really want to get work done.  It's a pity.  Perhaps Microsoft or a partner will come up with an alternative.
5,The Surface Pro 4 keyboard is an excellent companion to the Surface Pro 3 or 4.  The keypads are spaced well enough apart you are not hitting the wrong keys.  The mouse pad is a nice size (about the same size as the Macbook Pro mousepad) so it is easy to use without having to learn something different with a smaller mousepad.  One really nice feature of the Microsoft Surface Pro keyboard is the connection between the keyboard and the Surface Pro tablet.  A strong magnet pulls the keyboard into the Surface Pro slot and the keyboard folds up onto the tablet with another very strong magnet.  You will never have an issue keeping the keyboard and tablet together.  In fact once the keyboard is attached to the Surface Pro you now have a laptop combination.I would certainly recommend this keyboard over a generic bluetooth keyboard or a Surface Pro 3 keyboard.
5,The keypad is real nice. It attaches to the pad magnetically. It’s a firm attachment and it works flawlessly. Shipping was fast and the package was delivered in great shape. Thanks guys.
5,Fantastic upgrade to my Surface Pro 3.  My previous Type Cover's adhesive that holds the plastic spline to the magnetic edge became "unglued" this was a relatively unused type cover.  This new type cover had one issue out of the box which was the Surface Pro 3 was not recognizing it outside of the BIOS and Login Screen.  After a little research I found that this was due to a missed software update.  Once applying the update the Type Cover worked flawlessly.  Much better touchpad area better key travel and a more comfortable and pleasurable typing experience.  My only gripe is that I would have liked to see it come with the pen loop that was included in the previous generation's type cover (The Surface Pro 3 does not have the same magnetic attachment for the pen as the Pro 4 has).  I simply transferred it carefully over to the new Type Cover.
5,Works exactly as expected on my SP3. I ordered the teal and love the color. It has a velvety finish on the outside. The only thing I don't love about it is that when it's closed the keyboard only covers the front of the screen and the doesn't cover the entire surface pro. I would have liked it to cover the back as well so it would be more protected for transport. I just bought another case that holds the entire thing for transport. It's the way it was designed and it works just didn't quite expect that when I bought it. I still love it though....especially the color!!!A few things to note which don't bother me but surprised me:1) it smells BAD like wet paint when you first open it. Within a week the smell was gone.2) it has a velvety/fleecy finish on it. Not smooth. I actually like it but didn't expect it.
5,I had to buy the Microsoft Type Cover for Surface Pro - Black for my Surface Pro since it did not come with one. Got this one refurbished for really great price. Fits perfectly and works great.
4,I bought this product for both my Surface Pro's.  This one however doesn't have the finger identifier which I recommend if you like that sort of thing.  It fits easily on and off and the typing isn't loud like some keyboards.  The pro and con is the outside material.  It is like a smooth velvet texture which is easy to clean but the black color looks dingy or cheap.  I would recommend any color but black.
3,This keyboard is an obvious improvement over the last one and I love how easily it connects and disconnects with the surface pro. There is however a feature that I find frustrating. When scrolling up or down on the track pad with two fingers moving in parallel there is a tendency for the screen to accidentally zoom drastically in or out. This happens because the track pad is designed to also zoom the screen by making spreading or pinching motions with your fingers. This feature of the track pad is far too sensitive however and even the slightest deviation from strictly parallel motions of the fingers leads to zooming. The zooming accident also occurs repeatedly because I am accustomed to leaving my thumb at the lower left corner of the track pad (in preparation for clicking on items) while moving the cursor around with my finger. But because the track pad is one solid piece with no separate button for clicking on items the pad again wrongly interprets this as a two-finger zooming motion. I think it would be better to remove the zoom feature from the keyboard altogether because the user can already perform this motion and function directly on the screen of the surface pro.
5,I got this keyboard for my husband for his Microsoft Surface Pro 4. You can't have a Surface without a keyboard it's impossible to use. I would recommend this keyboard any day. This thing hooks straight onto the Surface magnetically and fits really well. Once it locks into place it stays there until you are ready to take it off again and because the surface is easy to prop up you can have a nice little laptop type setup that is comfortable and easy to use. We got the teal color and it is nice and not too overwhelming. The color is true to the image preview. We have had it a couple of months and have had no complaints or issues with it. The cover was shipped quickly and arrived right on the date expected. Good buy and great quality and I would recommend the color!
4,Overall this is a quality keyboard and touch pad and a large improvement over the previous one. The keys are clicky and spaced out well and the track pad is responsive. The front cover is soft protective and prevents damage to the screen. However I have had some issues connecting it to the Surface. Maybe 10-15 times in the last 2 and a half months of using it it failed to connect. The only way to fix this was a full reboot which considering the speed isn't that big of a deal but still annoying. If your going to key a Surface Pro then this keyboard is a must and overall it does a good job.
5,The best improvement I have seen in a long time!  For anyone who has a Surface Pro 3 (like me) upgrade to this keyboard.  My only complaint about the Surface Pro 3 was the damn keyboard.  This new one is simply amazing.  I could never type without mistyping on the old one.  Not with this one.  It feels like one of the best laptop keyboards I have ever typed on.The next thing is the trackpad.  Never used the other one because it was so bad.  I always had a bluetooth mouse with the old one.  I haven't used it yet with the new type cover.  Again one of the best trackpads I have ever used a laptop.  Smooth with a much deeper click than the old cover.I feel like I have a brand new laptop/Surface Pro 3.
4,This was a much better upgrade to my Microsoft Surface Pro 3 but I had infrequent connection problems. About once per hour of use I would have to detach and reattach the keyboard because it became unresponsive. I can't speak as to whether this was a problem with this keyboard or with my surface because I had this problem with my previous keyboard as well. It is also difficult to clean and I think the mouse pad is too large but that's a personal preference. Besides this the key spacing is great and I found it very easy to type on the keyboard.
5,Great Keyboard. Love the dark green color. You absolutely need this if you buy a surface pro. Pretty sturdy. Magnetically attaches to the surface pro and does not easily unhook itself accidentally so that's a plus. Protects my surface pro screen really well. Keeps the screen from getting scratches. Requires no batteries or charging. Gets powered by the tablet. Thin so does not make the tablet unnecessarily bulky. Have owned mine for 3 years now. Definitely would buy again if needed.
5,Works as expected
4,Gee I was sad when the keyboard cover on my beloved four-year-old Surface started falling apart!  I ordered this replacement and it came fast and has been perfect for several months now.  It's very durable as I occasionally drip liquid on it -- wipes right up no lasting damage I can see.  It has a nice backlight on the keys and the keystrokes are clean and comfortable with a very slight click as you depress the keys but nothing obnoxious.I took off one star because the price is so darn high.
4,Pros:Key action is nice also very responsiveTrack pad is also responsive and behaves as you would want it toFelt like coating so it's not a rough plastic shell against your screenCons:The price. Seriously this is overpricedI've tried a few of the off brand keyboards but either the keys or the pad were a compromise. This one feels nice almost like glass. It also hibernates the surface when closed and doesn't require Bluetooth and internal batteries to operate. Haven't noticed the battery life of the surface affected when the keyboard is connected either. Again the biggest con to this is the $100+ dollar price tag.
2,I finally gave in and bought a type cover after having my surface pro 4 for about 4 years since I was tired of lugging around a mouse and a keyboard for it. I've had it about two and a half months now and I regret ever getting it.The keyboard works fine but the track pad is awful; 1/4th of the time it works properly 1/4th of the time it doesn't respond at all and the rest of the time it glitches out my cursor goes sporadic. It also tends to get stuck when I click on something. It's crazy. I take care of my stuff I don't eat when I use it it isn't bent. But it's sure frustrating. I wish I could return it but I'm out of Amazon's return window. I really need a good keyboard but I'm not interested in buying another awful type cover. I may just sell my surface pro 4 so I can buy something with a keyboard attached. This is beyond frustrating.
5,Fits perfectly does a great job
5,I did buy a Moko keyboard before this and it has been a pain.I was hoping that the Moko keyboard would be a good replacement but of course it was half the price of this one and ended up proving that "saving is never gaining".The keyboard is nice to the touch; lights up does not need to be paired nor recharged and it just works. The touchpad is wonderful and you don't get the horrible double touch of the Moko keyboard; where when you tap on a location the mouse would follow the tap instead than record the click.Glad that I did spend 100 for this item better typing better trackpad lights up and no requirement for charging and pairing. A win.
5,I read somewhere have yet to find it again a note about windows 10 and using this keyboard with the pro 3.  I made the purchase wondering if windows 8.1 would be a problem in some way as one of the few not wanting windows 10.  I confirm this keyboard works with the pro 3 with windows 8.1 installed.  With so many upgrading to 10 the assumption would be reasonable for many reviewers and this point moot.  It is for those with windows 8.1 that I submit this feedback.I have yet to discover any keys or combination of keys not working as expected.  This IS an upgrade from the pro 3 keyboard so I hope this one lasts longer than the previous two failed pro 3 keyboards--over 3 years.
5,I don't think I could possibly be happier with this cover for my 2017 Surface Pro.  What I especially like is that it is small and lightweight but when you use it as a keyboard it really feels like a keyboard!  It doesn't feel flimsy fragile or like an afterthought.  It even has backlit keys.To me the keys have the perfect distance of travel: enough that I don't feel like I'm trying to type on a piece of paper but not so much as to make the cover too thick.One thing about this cover: Though it's called a "cover" I wouldn't say that it adds much in the way of protection for your Surface; you certainly wouldn't want to drop it even with this cover on!
4,This keyboard is a must have addition to the Surface Pro. Probably the best touch pad I've ever used the keyboard is backlit with the keys properly spaced as is in a normal notebook. One thing I don't like is the texture of the keys that while comfortable to touch seem to retain fingerprints and other imperfections. However nothing that a lint free cloth can't remove.While this is the least expensive OEM version I can find I still find it too much for an accessory that should come standard with such a premium device considering the necessity of it.As a stand alone product I highly recommend it.
5,I received this keyboard in the mail today and absolutely love it. It snaps onto place almost instantly and is difficult to remove unless you are intentionally pulling at the bottom. It has magnets that allow the keyboard to be raised at an angle so you do not have to type on the flat desk unless you want to. This keyboard has the texture of a mouse-pad-- which although unexpected is actually very nice. This way it prevents my hands from sliding around but also and acts a screen protector whenever closed (thank goodness!). Now I can throw this in my backpack without worrying about scratching the screen at all. he keys do not click obnoxiously but also have a satisfying amount of resistance to being pushed down to that it is a pleasure to type on.
4,I won't rehash what many reviews already stated on here but would echo that if you have an MS Surface 3 or 4 you definitely want this keyboard rather than the older version. I am used to using a trackpad on a MacBook and I don't feel like the trackpad on the MS keyboard is as sensitive which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I played with the settings but I just can't recreate the same responsiveness I get with my MacBook Pro. Not to say that it's bad the Apple one is just exceptionally good and has spoiled me for others I guess.
5,I have been using my Surface device with pen only. I used wireless usb receiver to connect mouse and keyboard when needed. I decided to spend to get this type cover and boy am I glad I did! It has a great feel and I love the adjustable backlights. Looks amazing. This addition had no impact on its portability either. Also I requested a replacement for the first one I got and it was with me the next day even before I returned the faulty one! That's what I call EXCELLENT service. Buy with confidence. You will not be disappointed.
5,Surface is Surface don't try to immitate a laptopthe shopping experience is great. But I'll have to say the idea and design of "typecover" for Surface is not a good design. If you use TypeCover you are basically using a surface like a laptop. But it has a lot of drawbacks than a real laptop like it's really awkward when working really on your laps.Surface is surface with its all new generation's interaction methods. The pen can totally replace the trackpad. And for typing in most cases the hand writing is enough to deal with. And the auto words/letters recognision is very good I would say. If you really want to use a keyboard outside your office say typing a long email I would highly recommend this portable keyboard. https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Universal-Foldable-Keyboard-Android/dp/B00UBGU4PY/
4,As keyboards for portable devices go I quite like it. Its no mechanical switch but the tactile feel of the keys allows me to type quickly and accurately. The backlighting on the keyboard is soft and pleasant though at some angles there are noticeable hotspots primarily from the function row. The magnets that hold it the surface are very strong and I've never had an issue with them detaching when I did not want. All in all I'd say it is a must have for the surface if you plan to do any amount of typing and aren't a fan of typing on a touch screen.
4,I am glad I went with the MS Type Cover as it has worked wonderfully!  It connects quick and easy and I find the keys a perfect fit for me.  There's a little bounce but it is actually much stronger than I expected and I am pleased with the protection it provides the screen of my SP4.  The only reason I do not rate it 4 Stars is actually an issue with Amazon.  It was ordered on Prime with a delivery date given at order of 2 business days.  It was later changed and came later.  This happens way too frequently!
5,I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and had the original Type Cover for that but the mouse "buttons" stopped working consistently so I needed to replace it.  I opted for the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover since it's compatible with the Surface Pro 3.  It's definitely an improvement. The keys feel better and the mouse pad is wider and better.  Still the small and straight keyboard strains my hands and wrists as compared to the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 that I use on my desktop.  But an ergonomic keyboard wouldn't fit as a type cover so this is about as good as it's going to get.  I have thought of looking for a folding Bluetooth ergonomic keyboard but I haven't.  I bet one exists.
3,No se que le pasa a los productos de la marca. Lo mismo me paso con una compu. Se daña de la nada inexplicablemente y luego no vuelve a funcionar.En este caso este teclado funciono muy bien durante 1 o  2 años y un día solo por que sí no funciono más. Se hizo todo lo recomendado habido y por haber incluso se probaron soluciones alternativas y nada. Comprar nuevo.
5,Product advertised "like new". As far as I can tell it is new condition but just didnt come with factory packaging (fantastic cause less junk to throw away). The keyboard has been redesigned with wider spaced keys has an extra fold to elevate the keyboard has a bigger track pad and is reverse compatible for surface pro 3 (the keyboard was ordered for surface pro 4). Packaging could have been a little better in a box vs. a bubble wrap lined envelope but it was sufficient for my order as the product didnt incure any damage. Delivered a day earlier than expected as I was alerted via an email. I'm happy cause I got a good and working product for a cheaper price.
4,Its a great keyboard and a must for the Surface if you really plan to use it like a laptop. The keys feel great and I haven't had a problem with the mouse other than occasionally having to hit the button a little harder with my sausage fingers to get it to respond. Probably not the keyboard's fault though. The felt surface does collect junk on the back though when you use the keyboard on any surface that isn't spotless. I also discovered that for just a few more bucks you can have the biometric fingerprint option from the Microsoft store so that might be a better option.
5,Not loud and its soft and gets the job done for me
4,I upgraded to the Type Cover 4 as the 3 can be a bit of a nuisance when programming. As you may know programming is very typing intensive. With my former type cover it wasn't impossible but it wasn't exactly comfortable. This one is leagues more comfortable as it is spaced out better you get more feedback from the keyboard and the TouchPad is more solid. If you can shell out the cash it is a worthy upgrade. Unfortunately I had to drop a star because $100 is a bit much for a keyboard improvement.
5,Is this keyboard the most comfortable keyboard I've ever typed on? Yes. Is this keyboard very light and easy to carry? Yes. Do I forget that I'm not typing on a full size keyboard sometimes? Yes all the time! This product is a joy to work on! The Trackpad has just the right amount of real estate to where it is not degratory to the size of the keys.Literally the only thing I can complain about with this keyboard after a few months of use is that it gets dirty really easily. I feel like the oils from my fingers are simply enough to make the keys start to sheen. It's kind of gross but not worth knocking off a star for!Amazing product!
5,I like the color of this keyboard. I like the way it feels too.
4,Not sure this should even be called an "accessory" or "option".  You simply need to have a keyboard to fully appreciate the Surface Pro.  The larger touchpad on this version is an improvement.  I wouldn't waste the extra money for the fingerprint scanning Type Cover.The feel of the keys and key response of this unit is much better than on the original Surface.  But when you are used to working mostly on a full size keyboard and mouse it is tough to say that you "love" this device.
4,It works like a champ just don't like the sheen on the keys as they show oils from your fingers very easily. That is more a nit pick issue rather than a performance one. I like the feel of the keyboard and it works well.  The home delete end keys along the top are a bit different in their location and layout so I always have to look at what I am hitting. Makes sense since the KB couldn't be set up with those keys right next to the main keys like on a regular KB.
5,If you ignore the price point this thing is great.  I have written large documents on this thing played Civ 5 web browsing and it works great.  Typing feels about as good as any decent laptop.  Its protective doesn't come off when closed on the surface and it doesnt flop open.  Only gripe with that actual tech is the is a slight velvety feel to the case that does pick up dirt.  I can pick up dirt around the hinge and edges so it does need a cleaning every now and then.Now when it comes to price this thing is pricey but after a while you will forget about the sting of the price and you'll be glad you got it.
5,I love this keyboard and color.  It was discounted when I purchased it I guess because the color wasn't as popular.  But saving $50 off a $129 item was too much for me to turn down.  Originally wanted the bright blue....but got this instead.  I LOVE IT.  The color is rich and gorgeous.  Looks great with my Surface Pro 4.  In general these keyboards are amazing.  Lighting is good feel is good track is awesome!  Such a wonderful keyboard it is a necessity if you have a Surface.Save some money and get this color...actually had I seen this in person I'd have chosen this no matter the discount.
5,all it was built up to be!  I have found this upgrade for my surface pro 3 to be so much better than I expected.  The print screen button is great and best of all is the keyboard spacing.  I used to hit more than one key all the time but now it is a much less common problem.  I can type much faster now.  Only con I can find is that it does not work with my docking station in the magnetically tipped up position.  The perimeter edges interfere.  It works fine though if the keyboard lies flat on the table.  I especially like the tactile keys compared to the Surface Pro 3 keyboard.  Thanks Microsoft great product!
2,There are scratches on the touchpad. A small tear in the bottom right corner which could potentially get larger. Returned it. This seller will refund after they receive the item.
5,I have the surface pro 3 and used the original type cover with it the past year. I researched these new type covers and wanted to use it because I thought it might help with the keys having spaces between them in this newer version. It made a significant difference in ease of use! I love this type cover so much! To anyone who uses there surface as much as I do and had the previous version I would highly recommend investing in this type cover. The color is very nice and the keys are not nearly as noisey as the previous version and can type without every key being heard by people next to me. I am very happy with my purchase
5,Absolutely love this keyboard. It's smaller than what I'm used to and the keys are sort of at a slant like an Apple keyboard so this is going to have to take some getting used to. They keys feel nice and have a very cool lighting effect that you'd have to see it in person to understand. I'll try to describe it though. The keyboard is back-lit when you turn on lights from a function key. If you don't use the keyboard for a bit the lights slowly dim then turn off. As soon as you move your finger across the track pad or press a key they slowly glow back on.Overall very nice comfortable and feels like a premium product.
5,Summary: Perfect for anyone with a Surface Pro 3 especially students. The typing experience is night and day compared to the the original Type Cover. I've had this new Type Cover for a few months and the biggest pro is that I make less typing mistakes along with the much improved track pad. If you're on the fence like I was you won't regret your purchase!PROS:-Improved typing experience (I'm tall with large hands)-Track-pad is noticeably improved (Larger and larger clickable area)-The additions of a windows button function button and a menu button (very useful)-Keyboard back lighting is still greatCON:-These type covers show wear after extended use (this one has held up very well since launch I would recommend regular cleaning)
5,A very good feature that I like is that the surface know when I flip the cover and change in response to tablet mode or laptop mode if the keyboard is rest on the table.the typing experience is very good and compy on my pc I use mechanical keyboard (blue cherry) and I can say that the feeling is as good as the cherries but the best of membrane and laptops so far!
5,This keyboard is awesome. I'm amazed at the engineering of this keyboard. I've really enjoyed the typing experience thus far. Here's a list of pros and cons:Pros:- Comfortable and even thought it is small it feels spacious.- Track pad is accurate and big.- Back-lit keys.- A lot of key travel for such a thin keyboard/cover.- Protects the screen when not in use.- Versatile and Stylish with a premium feel.Cons:- Ridiculous that it is not included in the purchase of a new SP4.- Expensive but essential addition to your SP4 experience.- Occasional glitch in recognition of pointer that is quickly fixed by reattachment of Type Cover.
5,Typically I will opt for a cheaper third party accessory however in this case the MS Type cover makes perfect sense as it is well integrated with the SP4. Overall I find the SP4 to be the best product design thus far from MS and compared to it's competitors places the SP4 above the rest. The only option that is missing is a tab to hold the pen as the magnets on the tablet are not strong enough to keep the pen in place if it is bumped against your side or leg when walking or being pulled from a backpack etc. most of the time. Overall it is well worth the additional costs over 3rd party solutions.
5,Feels good to type on. For a detachable track pad I like it much more than I thought I would. It's easy to attach and detach the magnets on it are handy and there's a little groove for the pen if you're tired of sticking the pen to the side of the tablet. This blue is a nice vibrant blue and is one of the better looking keyboard colors available. If you're looking for a case for the tablet itself as well this blue is a little hard to match. Although I was able to find matching cases know that sometimes the blues will be slightly off. I'm not sure why case manufacturers would not attempt to match the keyboard colors.
5,I have had the Surface 4 and the bright blue keyboard for about a year.  I wanted a change so I got this red one and I didn't remember how nice and bouncy the touch is on the new ones.  These keyboards are the best and can be replaced cheaply.  It's  like having a new computer really.  I had a very expensive "Sony Red" ($3000.00 +) and I loved the feel of the keyboard but I had to take it in and have it replaced 3 or 4 times within a year because the letters kept falling off.  This is a much better option.  Very nice!
5,I love this keyboard cover. It's sleek ads durability to the Surface Pro 4. And it's even back lit on the tablets power. I don't want to worry about batteries for a seperate device especially when I just keep the tablet charged all the time anyway. And I don't notice much difference in performance on battery life. The keys have good amount of travel and aren't loud when using them. And the track pad is much more accurate than the previous models(I came from the Surface Pro 1). I can flip it to use the tablet as a tablet or a laptop with ease. And it ads durability to the tablet. Well done.
5,I use this for my surface every day. I have a surface pro 3 and had the keyboard that was available at the time with it but the spacing of the keys of that keyboard was frustrating me. I had gotten used to the spacing of a Mac book pro keyboard prior to getting my surface so adjusting to keys not directly touching to keys touching was horrible for me. I decided that a new keyboard would be the best solution and I do not regret getting this keyboard for my surface pro 3 at all. Love the color too- I got the teal keyboard. The trackpad is also bigger on this keyboard which is nice.
4,I sent it back unopened.  I found i didn't need it.  Was great on sending it as well as letting me send it back. I paid for postage to return.
5,The type cover is the perfect accessory for my SP4. The color is unique and feels professional. The texture is smooth and the keys have good travel. The glass trackpad is very smooth and one of the best trackpads I've tried.There is one thing that I don't like about the keyboard layout is there is no direct key to control the brightness of the SP4 screen. After searching online I found a key combo which achieves this: Fn(hold) + Del/Backspace. Also the small up/down arrow keys felt weird at first but now I've gotten used to it.Overall this is an awesome product and a must have accessory for SP4.
5,I love that the Matte look matched my style and it’s responding well to my surface pro
5,Outstanding.I love the teal color and if you have any intentions of using the Surface Pro 4 for anything aside from games I would fully recommend this keyboard.  It is very lightweight and has a nice feel.  Also I have typed on other small keyboards (like Chromebooks) that have a very cramped feel.  This does not suffer from that whatsoever.It magnetically snaps into the base of the Surface Pro and can easily be detached.  When folded up it probably only adds a total thickness of 3/16 of an inch or so.  You won't even notice the added thickness or weight.
1,Not one month after purchased product keys started falling off and for some reason I can't return product.Do not buy form this seller!!!!! After contacting Microsoft found out purchased a used selling as new keyboard.
5,This is a big improvement over the Surface Pro 3 Type Cover. I bought it for my Surface Pro 3 and I don't regret it. There is a Print screen key the Fn key switches mode if you briefly press it but if you hold it it will only be enabled for the next key you press then disable itself right after so you get the best of both worlds. The touchpad feels much better and is larger. I do have a weird issue that sometimes the tap on the right side of it won't click for some reason.. but it is intermittent. I recommend it to any Surface Pro 3 owner that would like to improve their experience.
5,The product was in excellent condition. As the seller wrote that he is like as new as it is. Thanks to the seller. I am completely satisfied.
5,This design is much improved over the older type covers (Particularly Type Covers 1 and 2). I really enjoy the enlarged glass touchpad and the feel of the keys providing what feels like a full laptop keyboard in a much lighter formfactor. The backlighting is also good and not aggressively bright. Overall an excellent comfortable typing experience.This is an absolutely must-have accessory for the Surface Pro 3 or 4 if you are purchasing new it spends at least 90% of the time attached to my tablet. If you already have a Type Cover 3 and are thinking of upgrading this probably isn't enough of a difference to justify the price as it is an iterative improvement.
5,I bought this with because it felt necessary for me to use my Surface Pro 4 as a full design tool. Typing with the on screen keyboard was uncomfortable at best. Once I started using the type cover I couldn't go back. The texture is nice the keys have a nice travel range so it feels like a regular laptop and they aren't too loud either. The trackpad is glass so it's nice and smooth and the keyboard is also backlit which is a nice touch for night time use. This keyboard is great! It's just unfortunate that Microsoft doesn't just bundle it with the Surface device and it must be bought separately.
5,I've got a Surface Pro and it came with the standard black color keyboard.  I wanted something a little more exciting than basic "Black" that so I purchased the "Bright Blue" color.  💙  It is a very high quality keyboard and I like the fact it has a strong backlighting.
4,I like the overall quality of this Signature Type Cover. Keyboard as well as Touchpad is really good magnets which is used to connect it to Surface are really strong.Only problem is I did not find any safe way to clean the type cover surface. As it is in light gray tone regular usages makes the lower part (palm rest near touch pad) dirtier and in just two months of usages this section start looking darker.
4,While this item is overpriced it integrates perfectly with the Surface Pro 4. $100 for a small keyboard is a rip-off but they know that a lot of people buying the Pro are going to want a perfect fit keyboard. It attaches to the pro nicely and works as a screen protector when closed. Would have been nice if they could have figured out a way to add a USB port to it would be my only suggestion.
5,Amazing type cover!! I was bummed when I found out it was sold separately but after having it for 4 months it was definitely worth it. I'm a college student so the light behind the keys are perfect and it definitely helps that there's a button to control the brightness! It's a comfortable keyboard that makes you feel as if you're typing on an actual laptop. The touch mouse pad works great and I love the features. (3 finger scroll up to see all of your open windows). I would have to say that's in all this is a great type cover and I would highly recommend it!!
5,I purchased this type cover for my surface pro 4. It is very light weight and the keyboard layout is perfect for something so compact. It attaches tightly to the surface pro and I absolutely love the option to adjust the back light. The touch pad is smooth and great to the touch. The area surrounding the keyboard itself feels soft like it has some sort of suede texture so be aware of getting it dirty where as the backside is a true suede. Functionality wise it has performed as stated and I have not yet had any issues. I highly recommend this product!
3,This thing is junk.  I've had it less than a year and it's already fallen apart making it useless.  I mean I know things aren't built to last anymore but something this expensive really should last for more than a year.Updated: I'm morally torn about changing this review but the moment I posted my original one (a 1-star review after the product fell apart in less than a year) I was contacted by their customer service and they sent me a new one immediately.  After I received the new product I was emailed "Also I’d appreciate any feedback you care to offer on our service as we’re eager to create five-star experiences for every one of our Surface owners." Which feels like unapologetic pandering but also hey - they did send me a new one immediately.  So three stars.
5,I love this new type cover! It feels so much better than the 3 series. I like how the keys have a little space between them. It's a little quieter typing and it has a larger trackpad for mousing around. The back-lighting is a step up as well and has an even glow on each key. It can get quite bright too.It really is just an all-around improved upon keyboard. I am using it with a Surface Pro 3 (thank you MS for making them compatible!). Even if you're not upgrading to the Surface Pro 4 I'd recommend checking this keyboard out over the 3 series. You will be glad you did!
5,First you will obviously need to purchase this keyboard if you are a Surface owner and wish to best use your device. The updated Type Cover for the Surface Pro is a big improvement and quite a nice keyboard for the surface. Key spacing is much improved and I have had no issues with the trackpad. The updated Type Cover also seems to be a bit more rigid than previous versions removing some of the flimsiness that annoyed me before. The thing works well and is a must have for Surface owners. It would be nice if Microsoft included this with the Surface but as such it is worth the cost
4,MY wife loves this for her surface pro. She's very glad she got this for herself. She's actually using it right now. It's kind of overpriced considering you pay so much just for the surface pro itself. It makes the surface pro into more of a usable laptop. We weren't sure if it was necessary but it's basically irreplaceable once you have it. The blue color is also very nice.
4,This keyboard is so much better looking than the other super bold colorful keyboards. The feel and quality of the material are great. It feels nice to type on and I love the backlighting. Overall this is a product I would recommend for a Surface pro 4 user*** After ten months of use this keyboard has visible marks where I rest my hands. I have tried to clean it with different cleaner but nothing seems to work.
4,I wanted to mix it up a bit with my Surface Pro 4 so why not a red typecover.  I actually am not a fan of the red!  It's too bright for me.  But it works well and I like this material better than the Alcantara that the newer typecovers are made with.
5,This was for my roommate and while she was hoping for a purple keyboard (we previously ordered in error for the wrong Surface Pro version) this has the added benefit of a touch pad. It fits perfectly and is an absolute must add-on for Surface Pros. Just be careful of compatibility. As I mentioned in my other review "cover" is a very poor word choice on Microsoft's part as it is very misleading. This is an actual keyboard not some cover that requires u to purchase a keyboard separately like u would cover ur patio grill or something.
5,Definitely cheaper than buying it from the microsoft store directly.  I'm typing this review on this cover right now.  I love how it's backlit which is a pro for me because I do like to do some stuff on my computer while I'm already nice and comfy in bed and don't want to get up to turn the lights on.  The magnet is easy to attach to the surface; it clicks into place right away with a very strong hold.  A good case to also act as a screen protector too.  It's very thin and light.
5,Microsoft sure knows how to improve on their product. I was considering buying the now very affordable Surface Pro 3 Type Cover and I'm sure glad I didn't. This new Surface Pro 4 Type Cover sure does live up to all the hype and improvements. First thing I noticed was the new track pad! it's so big and the new glass surface performs so well. Between the stylus and this touch pad I'm thinking I may not need a external Bluetooth mouse. I also noticed that the keyboard now feels more like a real keyboard the keys have some travel and some space all making it a comfortable use.
5,After reading the reviews of other similar products I opted for the Microsoft QC7-00001 Type Cover for two reasons: (1) The raised keys with positive click effect gives the right feel of typing on a normal keyboard. (2) The soft rubber keys would be gentle on the touchscreen when used as a cover. I was not disappointed. Since I use this in conjunction with the ProCasse Premium Folio Cover the thin keyboard and soft keys work perfectly without scratching the monitor when closed. The magnet for docking is a great detail making docking a breeze (it almost docks itself).And it's almost weightless.
5,Beautiful addition to my Surface Pro 4.  This is the only type cover I will probably ever buy.  It's holding up very well with daily use.  I like how it feels in my hands.  The keys are crisp and the touch pad is definitely a different surface than the type cover which makes it much easier to find without looking for it.  While this is pricy so is the SP4.  Don't go cheap just because other type covers are there.  Get the best to go with the best Windows 10 tablet/laptop combination on the market.
4,I rather like it even if it is a little ridiculous on the price. I wanted one with the fingerprint scanner or the professional one with the extra battery in it (I'm used to 10-12 hours on my previous Asus tablets)...but not for what they want for them! This is well made and the backlight is rather nice. Caps Lock and Fn Lock indicators are also a nice touch.
4,Like the color.  Like the fact it works well with Surface.  Once in awhile gets a little buggy - but all it takes is it snap off/on again and it's fine.
2,Didn't even outlast the extended warranty on my Surface laptop.  My surface keyboard completely split apart on the magnetic hinge connecting it to the surface pro tablet.  This is after 2.5 years of normal use with a keyboard cover padded laptop case etc.The surface keyboard does not hold up well. In addition to the broken hinge the fabric corners of my keyboard have already started to separate a year in.  I spoke with Microsoft support and they told me that because the keyboard was past the year warranty they had no solutions to replace the keyboard.  A broken hinge is a pretty CRITICAL failure as far as I'm concerned.  Don't expect your surface keyboard to last 2 years.  If you want to continue to shell out $99 every 2 years for a working keyboard - this may be the product for you.
5,Love love love this color! Unfortunately my Surface fell off the TSA belt and it broke the 2 little stubs that helped hold it on. Now it slides to the side if it's not fully connected with the magnetic strip. Tried to replace it but this color no longer exists after a month.
4,I really wish MS would just start bundling these with the Surface Pro's already.  It's kind of ridiculous that I have to spend another $130 on the item when I already dropped $900 on the machine.  It's also extremely confusing to explain why I need this for budget approval.Other than that this is a much better version of the last type cover I used (SP1).  Track pad is much better and the keys feel great.  No complaints.
4,This keyboard supplies a fantastic typing experience however it comes at the cost of being a magnet to anything that can dirty it. However all you have to do is clean it off every once in a while with an (ever so slightly) moist cloth and that should do the trick. Just don't give it water damage!In all the pros outweigh the cons. If you want the full Surface experience this is somewhat of a must have.
5,it did what I needed it to do. I used this on my surface pro 4 and it worked well. I gave the surface to my wife and she like the keyboard as well.
2,This thing will die right after the one year warranty is over!I received a Surface Pro as a gift. The keyboard lasted just past the one year warranty period. I looked around for a replacement. Could only find Mircosoft's keyboard and thrid party bluetooth ones. Didn't want the headache of a battery powered attachment. So I bought the Microsoft one which lasted just past the warranty period. Still not wanting a bluetooth thing I just bought another Microsoft keyboard WITH a four year warranty for an extra $30.
4,The day I bought this I would have given it a three star rating. Now I'm getting used to it and I'm at four stars. Not sure I'll get to five but there is a chance. This is a very sensitive keyboard. It attaches perfectly to the Surface Pro and becomes the first line of defense for the screen protection. I would certainly buy this again as opposed to most of the other options available.
5,This model does not include the finger print reader. It is a vast improvement over the previous type cover for the surface 3 pro. I purchased it to replace that on a MS3 Pro and fits well. High quality material. Keyboard keys are so acoustic and have good travel and feel with typing. Track pad is larger and very responsive. Back lighting works easily by clicking correct key combination. Function key toggle stats in place when clicked with a light indicator  to allow easier use of function keys. All in all very well designed.
3,The product works great and I am glad I got a type cover for my tablet but I was expecting it to be black like the listing says. My type cover is a medium dark grey and NOT black. A little disappointment as I wanted to match my black case. If I knew it was not actually black I would of most likely gotten the teal to contrast the black case but now I have black and grey and I am not too happy with the combo. Other than the mislabeled black listing I enjoy typing on this thing and think it is a great product. Also this functions fully on my surface pro 3 so I do not have to deal with the close keys on the surface 3 type cover.
5,Compared to previously generations the Surface Pro 4 type cover is an incredible improvement and it even holds it's own compared to many other laptop keyboards. I also love the fit finish and style of this product! The feel of the felt cover is magnificent and the product just feels premium which I would expect for the price. Overall it's a wonderful complement to the SP4.My favorite part? The updated trackpad is light years beyond the SP/S3 Type Covers of the past. I find it smooth to operate and extremely responsive! I have not been disappointed in this purchase at all.
5,The travel speed on the keys feel so normal and the back-lit keyboard is awesome. I love the glass track pad which offers users such a nice experience especially for being so small. Microsoft has really outdone themselves with the level of attention they bring to the user experience. My only caveat with the keyboard was that when you have your SP device on its side the keyboard/trackpad no longer work. I'm eagerly waiting for Microsoft to giver users more customization in this aspect. I use this with my SP3 and it makes the entire experience seamless and comfortable.
4,I bought this device for my surface go for it works well I did initially have some interference with my wireless mouse and keyboard a USB extension solved this problem for me. It seems to be made very well anodized aluminum casing Heavy gauge cord lightweight compact does everything i need it to so far.
1,I will revise this review if this keyboard proves to be the one in a million defect.Let me preface this by saying I LOVE MY SURFACE PRO 3.  So the 4 is coming out and I read that there are a lot of neat things about it.  However I managed to get a slightly used three with literally every feature warranty and accessory for $1100 bucks so I am not wanting to spend 3k on a Surface Pro 4.  After reading the reviews I saw there was one way to enhance my 3.  The NEW KEYBOARD.  I was excited.It arrived.  Nice spaced out keys.  Bigger touchpad.  I am hoping they will update the drivers to make the touchpad more useful then I noticed it doesn't come with a stylus holder.  Not a big deal.  I can figure that out.Then I connect it.  That lovely little click happens and I expect to hear the second sound as the keyboard is bonded to the front of the surface.  Nothing.  I set it in the dock and my keyboard flops flat.  This feels like getting a fruitcake for Christmas.  I know it's a first world problem but it was a bummer.It is already back in the box and RMA'd I am calling Microsoft to ask what gives.  I await the replacement from Amazon but after finally being able to tell people here is something Microsoft really got right it is sad to see this lovely keyboard not function.
5,As a long time Mac user  i've been spoiled with an excellent keyboard for over 10 years. Before that the IBM ThinkPad was the king of laptop keyboards.  I bought a Microsoft surface pro 3 and heard from someone at the Microsoft store  that the type cover 4 fits the SP3.  I've been using the surface now for a few weeks with this type cover and have been very happy with the typing experience. I also really like the surface experience it does give you the best of both worlds.
3,I read the reviews of the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover and thought it was a no-brainer upgrade for my new SP4. I sold my SP3 with its eponymous Type Cover and now I'm sort of regretting not keeping the older machine's keyboard.Pros:The trackpad is markedly betterThe keys have variable back-lighting (it's no longer an all-or-nothing thing)The key spacing makes the arrow keys easier to find.Cons:The keys on the SP4 cover are spongy and unresponsive compared to the crisp SP3 cover's keys.The SP4 cover seems bulkier and doesn't magnetically 'snap' closed against the device.The palmrest feels like suede which is unpleasant.Verdict: go to a brick and mortar store and try out the new cover before shelling out $70+ to upgrade.
5,The type cover works well and is overall a better cover than the Surface 3 type cover. I love that the keys are more spaced apart and that they don't make as much noise while typing. I also like the feel of the keys and the trackpad is equally great. In total the functionality of the type cover is amazing. The only thing I'm not pleased with is that I ordered a bright blue keyboard and received a black one instead.
4,I didn't have a keyboard before this just a protective cover but as I have become used to the keyboard I have grown rather fond of it.Good: Much easier typing attaches nicely provides reasonable protection.Bad: Doesn't provide as much edge protection as dedicated covers. Keyboard occasionally doesn't work requiring an iPad restart to get it going. Poor self-support in portrait mode although better than nothing (i.e. when it's in my lap).
1,EL PRODUCTO LLEGO SUCIO... PARECE COMO SI LLEVARA 3 A~OS DE USO
5,I've been using the cover for a few weeks. It is very comfortable to type on. The keys respond like those on a laptop with more travel than you would expect. I don't have to crowd my hands and fingers together like on many portable keyboards.The touch pad is very close to the feel of one on a laptop. It is large enough for multi-touch movements without wandering off the pad.The magnets that hold it to the surface pro 4 are strong with no risk of accidental disconnection.No complaints so far. I'll update after a couple more months of use.
4,The device works just fine but may need to recheck when packing it in and trying to reopen with a box knife there seems to be a rip on the keyboard on the top corner of the keyboard. It doesn't bother me but how I opened the package it was already sliced open from when the keyboard was in and where the cut of the fabric was made.
4,After a few months of using this. The color is still something  I enjoy and the durability of the suede style finish is still looking good. I find it comfortable and the quality of the product is fantastic. My only qualm with the product is that it is expensiv for what it is but if the quality holds up I may even be able to look past that.
3,Mine died after 12 months of light usage. The internal cable that linked the magnetic connector to the keyboard cracked in half. Microsoft just shrugged at me when I tried to get it replaced. When it worked it was great but the build quality for the price is laughable. As a result I will be looking for an alternative to the Surface Pro for my business in the future.
5,pros-significant upgrade from pro 3 surfaces type cover and even surface pro 4 with standard keyboard-feels like the laptop is newer (not in terms of performance of surface but the feeling of new)-feels like its a actual laptop keyboard with nice travel of keys and responsive and larger mouse/trackpad-improved spacing between keys-lighted-premium feeling of fabric and colorcons-price-unknown if it will last only time tells you that-could get dirty just like all the other type covers would have done if placed on dirty surfaces
4,While I do like my surface my one complaint is the touchpad on this keyboard. I would give it 4.5 but apparently I can only use whole numbers. The touch pad works as expected but it is not as smooth as my 2010 MacBook pro or newer MacBook airs. I did not expect it to the same but I often feel too much drag on my fingers with excessive use.
5,Vastly improved over the older editions of the Surface keyboard this is sturdy and the keys are separated chicklet style keys making typing much more accurate. It's also got a larger touch pad making it useful for touch gestures to scroll zoom etc. And--it's backlit when you touch it. Overall a very nice product. After using the initial iterations of the Surface keyboard (going back to the RT) I didn't think I'd ever say it's "a very nice product." But clearly the engineers listened and improved the product.
3,This is an early review. I just received this a few hours ago.The keyboard flex is minimal and feedback is sound. The track-pad works well and is responsive to taps for clicks. Back lighting is adjustable and well done. Attaches securely and really simply with the magnetic hinge. I'll post back after I use it a while.HOWEVER I am very disappointed that the cover does not magnetically LATCH. I mean seriously the keyboard cover will just flop open as there is nothing (no magnets) to hold it in place. Even the most basic iPad covers latch closed very securely via embedded magnets. This is a major oversight on the part of Microsoft and deserving of a 2 star ding.
4,I love the key travel and the feel of the keys. The trackpad is also a good size! The one thing I dont really like about it is that it gets dirty fast. On the back of mine there are black marks all over it. Doesnt affect the functionality but it does look dirty.All and all a great product. Might want to get a different color though
5,This Type cover is such an improvement from the 3rd generation Type Cover! The keys are more spread out and comfortable to type on the mouse pad is bigger the whole cover feels stiffer and more rigid and the keys feel more springy and have a better feedback. With the 3rd generation type cover I felt like the keys didn't give enough feedback and sometimes felt kind of damp. The keys on this cover are completely different more like a macbook's keys I'd say. I have no complaints about this type cover and I've been using it for several months now. I recommend it!
5,This keyboard is excellent plain and simple.  I am amazed on how well the keys work and feel on a device this thin.  You really appreciate the extra large glide pad on this unit as it's a nice step up from the SP3 keyboard.  Even though it is a little expensive it is worth it and a necessity if you own a Surface Pro 4I base my review on the keyboard itself not on the fact that I think it's a little on the expensive side and should be included with the Pro in the first place.
5,Just WOW!!!I was planning to upgrade to a Pro 4 in a few weeks so i thought i would go ahead and order and use the pro 4 type cover on my pro 3.  As the first line says Just WOW!!!The track pad is just perfect and i really didnt think i would give a hoot about the keys being differet but yeah their pretty great.  Its like their just far enough apart.  Never really noticed the pro 3 keyboard keys were too close together before using this but now im pretty happy with it.
5,This is my second keyboard for my Surface Pro 3.  The first one lasted almost 3 years. This one is the same great quality and I like how the keys are a tiny bit smaller but has more space between the keys. I love the bold red color. No installation required. It came well packaged and after removing it from the box and attaching it to my laptop it worked immediately. Very convenient.
2,Honestly I love the look of the key board but it has some flaws. Sometimes the keys do not light up and sometimes they do. They should be lit up the whole time when computer is turned on. In this picture they do not want to light up even though the computer is on. Also the keyboard will often not work and I have to remove it from the surface pro and reattach it to get it to work. Kinda frustrating but it still works.
5,The new typecover for Surface Pro 4 is a nice upgrade over the one that came with my Surface Pro 3.  The raised individual keys are easier to type on.  The larger trackpad does come in handy from time to time on applications with features too small to respond to touch.  It also works on web menus that are incompatible with touch.  The one criticism is that when the keyboard is in place it makes it hard to touch the bottom of the screen on the tablet (where the start bar is by default).
3,This is obviously not new as it came in a very generic box. The original sticker code being covered over by another sticker. It also is missing the Microsoft info on the magnetic connection area that my husband’s keyboard has so I don’t think it is made by Microsoft either.That being said it works just fine and is a very pretty color; so if function and style is more your concern this keyboard is great! If brand and identification is more your concern (as I’m sure Microsoft will not honor the warranty of a product not made by them) then it’s not so great.
5,Picked this up to replace the Type Cover on a Surface Pro 3.  This keyboard is better in every way when compared to the previous generation. The keys are separated and for me typing accuracy and speed are both improved.  The touch pad portion of the new keyboard cover has also seen a significant improvement it feels better and it is larger.New drivers were required but my Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10 installed those automatically once installed a reboot had this cover working perfectly.This is a must-have upgrade for all Surface Pro 3/4 users.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've waited about 10 days for shipping and finally I received a damaged product!Please see the attached video and images.
5,I bought a "Like New" keyboard from BlueProton for $80 and it works :) Looks basically new all the keys work no problems so far. Will update if anything changes.
5,If you have an older Surface Pro 3 keyboard -- get this thing if you want to upgrade the typing experience of your Surface Pro 3. I was astounded how much better it was than the old keyboard and how much more consistent I could type. The touch pad is better the key spacing is better the Fn key is now a toggle ... just all around a great improvement.It's still not the most "developer" friendly keyboard as the layout of the keys is a bit strange and some keys are hidden behind a Fn press which is unfortunate.
5,Good quality nice key touch exactly as shown
2,Given all the positive reviews and a very decent showing by the Surface Pro 4 itself I was quite enthusiastic about the Type Cover. Unfortunately it turned out to be a major disappointment. The felt/velvety outside surface has poor appearance is impossible to clean and doesn't age well at all; the edges are flimsy and sharp at the same time. The touchpad may be OK by the standards of ten years ago but it's pathetic compared to the competition now. I did run into an OS bug where the keyboard is sometimes not recognized after waking until I detach and reattach it. The fabric connector between the cover and the magnetic port flap is flimsy and wearing out; I expect it to fall apart given the effort required to pull on it to disengage the magnet. The keyboard is OK and would actually be good to type on if not for the flex and play from the hollow space underneath it while typing; I'd much rather have it sit on the tabletop underneath instead of in the air. For the price and the hype I was expecting something radically better.
4,Great keyboard. I purchased the teal one and it looks just like the picture -- I love the color. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because the top and bottom arrow keys are only half-a-key wide. Since I use the arrow keys quite a lot this is an issue for me because my fingers barely fit on the keys.
5,I just got this keyboard because my old one is so worn out and pretty much broken after a few years of constant use. So far this keyboard has worked well everything feels like the original keyboard from Microsoft. I love the light grey color it brightens up the dark surface and brightens my work day a little :)
1,Click will go out within 2 months. Have used multiple keyboards for surface pros and this brand always has an issue with the click!
4,It is a solid keyboard for my Surface Pro 4. I actually really like the typing experience. I feel the traveling distance is longer than my MacBook pro. The color is on the dark grey side very subtle. Track pad is good but I think it could be larger. One down side is the flex of the keyboard but given the thin profile it is understandable.
5,I love the touch of this keyboard.  It is very easy to type on.  I do find that it locks up at times so I need to close the computer down and then it works again.  Not sure if that is a keyboard issue or a computer one however.  I guess if it continues to do so my computer will go back in for service even though it is brand new.  I gave this a 5 star rating because of the uncertainty of whether it is a keyboard issue or a computer problem.
5,No surprise most people love this keyboard.  As far as surface accessories go this is the stand out must buy item.  The only question is whether to buy this one or the fingerprint one.  If you want a specific color you won't have a choice.  I think I should have gotten the fingerprint one.  This is great but windows hello doesn't always work and fingerprint technology is pretty good these days.  In a dark room it still works.  That said no complaints on this keyboard.
5,This keyboard worked instantly. I've yet to experience any problems with it. Typing on it for me is akin to typing on a regular keyboard which it is in a way. It forms a great cover for the Surface Pro 4 screen. I do with that it came with a strap attached to the bottom to make it latch around the Surface Pro 4 more securely when packing and storing it but I improvised with a coloured elastic band.
4,Very light weight. Detachable Does a good job of substituting for full size keyboard given light weight and thin profile and the touch pad is very nice. Seems quite durable given the form factor. Sometimes keys fell a little cramped. Some of the extra keys like arrows PgUp are hard to hit accurately.
5,I haven't been able to notice a difference from the one that came with my Surface Pro. I really enjoy using this. No complaints.
5,This is a great addon to your surface a must have.
5,Feels nice to type on and really have nothing bad to say about it lots of little things are nice too that you'd never think about looking for in a keyboard.  Example would be the keys are the perfect size to keep anything from getting under them like say food or dirt especially helpful considering it's for an on the go device.TLDR: Keyboard is even better than the surface I got it for.
5,Seriously this is the best portable keyboard I have ever typed on. No joke. Better than my Dell XPS better than my Macbook air and nearly as good as my Logitech wireless keyboard for my desktop. Microsoft has a real winner on their hands. I have no idea how they did it. Short key travel but man is it awesome. How they crammed such a great keyboard into a thin cover is beyond understanding. Just try it. I am not getting paid to say this I am just down right impressed. Highly recommended!
5,Perfect replacement for  SP3 Type cover.  Key spacing and touch is much improved and the mouse behavior is SO MUCH better.Works and fits perfectly but is a little different; there is a bit of finagling when putting the SP3 into the dock with the cover attached.  The cover and dock overlap a little bit and it forces the keyboard magnets away from the body so the keyboard wants to lay flat.This KBD made me fall in love all over again with my SP3....
4,gorgeous color! however sides are prone to damage
3,Backlit sleek & durable this is among the best mobile keyboards I've yet to see. Definitely recommend this item. I think the keyboard with the touch ID is a waste personally.Six or seven months into using this item keys began to stop working properly. It began with the V then moved onto many other letters. I think the surface keyboard was awesome at first though it just broke down on me. Perhaps it's because it's so thin & more prone to damage I'm not entirely sure. Though I would say 5 stars first six months 3 stars the next couple months and 1 star today.
3,This is the main reason I purchase my SP4. I was surprised at how responsive the trackpad and keyboard were. It is a great product with one flaw that almost ruins the whole thing. I'm not sure if it is a firmware issue with the keyboard or a software issue with the SP4 but the trackpad occasionally acts erratic. Some customers complained that it will not work at all. For me the mouse arrow would jump all over my screen while I'm trying to use it. It would force me to use the touchscreen or restart the computer in order for the trackpad to function properly again
3,I loved the color and the quality of the product seemed great but I had a Surface Pro 2 and needed to upgrade after I accidentally dropped mine and shattered the screen. I upgraded to the 4 and bought this Type Cover and was SO disappointed! The connection with the Type Cover  and Surface Pro was horrible and I am not sure if it was the Type Cover or a mix of the Type Cover and the Surface Pro that just was not up to Microsoft standards! I ended up returning both for a full refund because I was so disappointed.
5,The "S" key cover popped off and disappeared the second time I brought it out to use it!  But this keyboard is easily replaceable via Amazon as a very recent order. Otherwise it's a neat fit for the Surface Pro super quick and easy to attach and detach.  Great touch and feel and I like the soft brushed leather-like texture of the outside cover.  Intuitive and easy to use the teal a nice change from usual keyboard colors and I've already ordered another.
4,It is difficult to scroll using your fingers but other than that I'm happy with my purchase!
4,It works and feels well. I think sometimes the the keys dont register if i lightly tap
4,Definitely worth it to upgrade from the Surface Pro 3 Type Cover. Works great with my Surface Pro 3. Huge improvement to the trackpad and the keyboard. Note to other users: if the type cover backlight isn't on press the F2 key a few times as the F1 and F2 adjust the backlight settings for the type cover. Took off one star because it smells funky like carcinogenic plastic.
4,Does what it needs to do for the most part. Got one used and it has grease marks where the most used keys were from the original user. And some of the buttons don't feel so great and take a few tries to get to work.
4,This keyboard is perfect for my Surface Pro 4. It's light sturdy and good looking. The typing experience is great and the track pad is great too. If you have an SP4 you need this keyboard. I've had mine for over a month now and the quality is solid. I don't see this breaking any time soon! Very glad I got it and would recommend it to anyone.
3,Sometimes the keyboard doesnt wake after sitting for a moment and I have to reconnect it for it to register.
4,I enjoyed buying this product it is really a must when you have a windows surface the keyboard performs well however on the key board that was sent to me had a minor depression on the right hand side of the touch pad it sort of bothered me while sliding my finger over while scrolling.
5,Being a girl color was important. I wanted something different that would be bold. This is such a pretty teal. The photos don't do it justice. It also has a soft velvet texture I wasn't expecting. The keys are smooth and easy to press. It also stays solidly connected to the tablet but is easy to disconnect when you need to. I found that starting to pull on one side gently and sort of peeling from the device works best.
5,I love this keyboard! So much better than the Pro 3 type cover. Trackpad is smoother and a little larger thus making it easier to navigate with it. The keys are slightly smaller and more spaced out making it more difficult to fat-finger keys in my opinion. The color is very true to the picture (I ordered the light blue/cyan color) and it connects to my Surface Pro 3 with ease even in a case and instantly allows typing. The backlit functionality is an added plus!
5,Didn't want to spend the money initially but I'm glad I did. the keys are very nicely spaced the keyboard is comfortable to use and the trackpad works perfectly. Really love the lights under the keys. Arrow keys are a little close together but that is very minor. Sometimes the keyboard isn't recognized but undocking and re-docking the device makes it work again immediately. Going on 5 months of use and not showing any wear.
4,Works very well.  Really like the stiff surface.  Lights up nice and touch is nice.  Rarely but here and there will stop working.  Just pull off device and put back on (which is really quick and easy) and you're back in business.  Some reviewers make it seem like a constant problem.  Really hasn't been much of a bother for me.
4,Nice keyboard the touchpad does not alway work so you have to click it a few times at times.  Also the keyboard loses connect with the Surface Pro 4 especially since the computer switches from laptop to tablet mode to easy.  Like that it acts like a screen cover too.
5,I used to have one of the first gen if not second generation keyboards. This new keyboard is way better the keys are spread out a lot better that it makes it easier for typing.  Additionally this has a better spring on the keyboard so it feels real nice typing. I would highly recommend this. I'm using this on my Surface Pro 3
4,The alcantara fabric started to wear off in a few months so the black plastic material is showing in some places. Aesthetics aside this is an excellent keyboard with very good travel and is quite comfortable to type with.
5,This keyboard for the Surface Pro 4 is great.  It's so easy to type on and I've had no issues at all.  I did have to reorient my thinking  about the location of the "Home" and "End" keys but that's a small thing.  I love the feel of the keyboard and the size is perfect.  I have large hands and the fit is very good.  Microsoft should have done as good a job on the dock as they did on this keyboard.
5,This is a must have if you own a Surface Pro 4. I tried using my Surface Pro 4 without buying the keyboard but I found it to be painful having to enter information using the on-screen keyboard. Microsoft should have included this with the Surface but maybe not everyone feels the same way.I love the feel of the keys the trackpad works great and it connects really easily to the Surface. I highly recommend getting this if you are unsure!
5,Great cover that will fit your Surface Pro 4. It is backlit which is nice. Also if you've ever used a Pro 3 keyboard you'll appreciate that this keyboard has a more natural typing position - very few errors result as a result of the layout/spacing between keys. The touchpad is nice but the clicks from it are rather loud if using in a library/speech setting. Otherwise very nice quality and durability. Quickly detaches/attached magnetically.
5,I had a black Microsoft Surface Pro 4 type keyboard on my prior Surface.  I gave that Surface to one of my family members who needed it.  So I got an new Surface and purchased this keyboard because I liked the color.  I can't say it isn't my imagination but I think I can type better with fewer errors than on my prior Surface keyboard.  Anyway I am happy with this purchase.
5,I'm glad I went with red it's actually a bit deeper then how bright red it is in the photos and over time the felt has become more plush so it feels softer. The keys feel good to type on for such a slim profile not the same response as a full keyboard but more then comfortable enough to work on for long periods of time.I havent had much issues with the touch keyboard but I have used better track pads elsewhere.
2,This keyboard has been problematic from the first moment. It periodically disconnects from the computer or the trackpad goes crazy and the mouse jumps around the screen.It color is great and it attaches/detaches in an instant but it's a real hassle when it flips out and there's never any clear indication of when it will flip out. Sometimes it's fine for days other times it happens every ten minutes. Doesn't seem to make a difference if the Surface is connected to power or not. There's no dust in the connectors or anything--it's been like this since I took it out of the box.
5,I purchased this type cover as replacement for my surface pro 3 (which was great for this 4 years). this new one delivers a muche better typping experience. I am supper happy with the new type cover.
3,Better than the previous keyboard for the Surface 3 but mouse scrolling is still not good.  It doesn't get traction from your finger and find myself just using the down arrow on web pages.  All the reviews gave it high remarks from tech sites I trust and I agree the glass pad is a big improvement but not for $130.I've used it on both my Surface 3 and 4 with similar results.  Keyboard is pretty good but i found it still flexed a bit.  Better than the old keyboard but still not as stiff as I would like it.
1,This is my fourth type cover purchased since I bought my Surface Pro 3 in 2014.  The previous three lasted 6 months to a year this one only three months.It's the same situation - one or more of the keys stop working completely or become extremely difficult to press and/or the keyboard stops waking up without first unplugging/replugging it.I have tried to get warranty service for the three previous keyboards.  Each seller said take it up with Microsoft as it's outside the Amazon return window.  I have yet to get any replacements from Microsoft.  I have to send the keyboards in plus pay for shipping both ways and pay a high $ replacement fee - just to get a refurbished keyboard back.I really love these type covers -- when they work they are awesome.I don't really want a bluetooth keyboard as I really like the magnetic connection and power from the surface.I'm not sure I want to pay for a fifth dud type cover.  I could replace the surface with a brand new tablet from someone else for what I've spent on four (now maybe five) type covers.
1,They must have sent me a refurbished keyboard because I am having the same problem with this new one where the keyboard/touchpad keeps me from typing or even using my mouse pad. To make this work I have to disconnect the new keypad from the monitor and put it back on and hope that the mouse is then working. Very very disappointed with this purchase and would never buy from them again.
5,I was tempted to give this 4 stars based on the fact you have to buy a separate keyboard when you purchase a Surface Pro. Regardless its a fantastic keyboard. The keys have a nice tactical feed back when you press them. Its not soft/squishy. Back lighting works well (you must click the F1 or F1 keys 3 times in a row to increase or decrease the brightness). The track pad works well and has a solid feedback when you left or right click.
5,This thing works great. Sure it's a keyboard but I really like the light up feature and the buttons are easy to access. It reminds me of the Apple Bluetooth keyboard. The touch pad works better than any laptop I've ever used and I hate them. I don't even need a regular mouse after using this one. The slant feature is brilliant. The only think I don't like is that it doesn't stay closed with my current case. I'd recommend this to even my worst enemy.
1,I ordered this product because my previous keyboard (purchased used and I used it for several years) was getting unreliable and ended up in bad shape. This keyboard (purchased NEW) has very quickly proved to be in bad shape as well. Within less than 3 months the top bar has split apart and is sticking to the computer while the bottom part is unresponsive. Sometimes despite zero separation from the computer the trackpad simply refuses to work.Do not buy this product without some kind of money-back guarantee as you will almost certaintly outlive its reliability!
5,If you have a Surface Pro 3 and want a much better typing experience than the Surface Pro 3 keyboard can provide buy this. It is fully compatible with the Surface Pro 3 but it offers an infinitely improved typing experience. The keys have a much improved tactile feel and the spacing between them makes it much more difficult to accidentally push a wrong key. Also the larger track pad makes a huge difference. You will certainly enjoy your typing experience more with this type cover.
5,Unreal!  Better than I could have hoped for!  With the addition of this to my new Surface Pro 4 i7 (16G / 256G) I think this might be my favorite computer ever...  Finally something portable powerful and beautiful.  Keys work well feels "full size".  Track pad seems quality but I haven't used it much.  Magnate attachment frees up the USB for my mouse without the need for a dongle/splitter.
5,Exactly what I wanted. It works great and doesn’t have a single scratch. Came in the sealed original package. Highly recommend if you want to buy the original keyboard but also want to save a few dollars.P.s. it has a strong paint smell. I’m hoping that with time and use it will slowly fade away.
4,does the job i ended p returning this computer many reasons did not like that i had to constantly figure out ways to use it tho. best used at a desk.  I wont take away stars about how expensive and that it didn't come with the computer because thats greed out of the company. but the product it self worked.
5,Works only gripe is picture looked more teal and it’s definitely denim blue. Oh well at least it works
4,It's a must have for a Surface Pro. It's a cover and keyboard all in one. The only problem is the keyboard flexes too much when I type. Fat fingers I guess.
4,smelt funny when i got it. It was refurbished.  Smell went away after a day or so.  Only a couple times it wouldnt read by the surface.  but 98% of the time it worked great.  As with any tech object there will be some issues with some of the products.
5,I have only had it 2 weeks so I can't talk to longevity but it is a big upgrade to the standard keyboard that I had with my surface pro 3 - this works well on the older machine and is much easier to type on. The touch screen is a little tricky it functions well but the tapping area for the right click can be hard to find.  I did have to run an update to get it to work
5,We use our keyboard on our SP4 every day. The on-screen keyboard is very frustrating but is nice if you are using it in tablet mode so this removable keyboard is very accommodating. The only thing I don't like about it it sometimes makes the SP4 glitch. It won't recognize it or it just plain and simple doesn't work. We have to restart the SP4 to get it to work which sucks but overall I am very happy with it.
3,I wish I can say a lot more positive feed back for this product but all I can say is for typing it great medium perfectly designed for the  Surface Pro 3/4 however this Microsoft Type Cover for Surface Pro have a issue with the trackpad.  It works when it wants to and I would occasionally would have to use my bluetooth mouse to compensate for the lack of performance of the trackpad.
4,Looks and feels nice. Snaps in nicely to my Surface Pro 3. I like the material.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it came out of the wrapper with a small spot of some kind of gunk on the back otherwise it's great
4,This is a great computer but I gave it 4 stars because when I got it the stylus and camera did not work.  I read about it and finally ended up updating the computer from then microsoft website.  After I did this the stylus and camera work just fine.
5,Bought this for my Surface Pro 4: exactly how its supposed to be no problems. My only complaint is that the fabric on the back does get a bit discolored over time(if you keep in in your backpack or something) but not enough to discourage me from buying it. Overall even after a year I still love it! (ignore the brown cover in the photos I also bought that on Amazon).
5,Classy look. I keep mine stored in my bag for use when traveling.  At home I use a wireless keyboard.I understand that a new line of Surface Alcantara-covered Type Covers in 4 colors will launch this week (May 23rd) alongside the new Surface Pro.  The new Type Cover colors seem to be aligned with the 4 new colors being applied to the recently announced Surface Laptop.
1,I live in NJ where the restrictions were very harsh. I tried to get a repair person to check out my computer and couldn't get any one unless I drove over an hour but open times never aligned with my work schedule. Finally got some help to find out that the Microsoft Computer is useless if you need a minor repair. The key board worked on a friends computer but not mine. She was quarantined for over a years because she is high risk. Now I can't send back because it is past the return date . Where can I resell on line. NOT WORTH THE $100 of AGRAVATION. DO NOT PURCHASE ELECTRONIC PARTS ON LINE EVER> THERE IS NO RECOURSE.
5,Color is great.  Not in your face.  Looks like the image.  The magnet strip is very convenient when attaching and detaching to my surface pro 4.  Not the biggest fan of the touchpad.  Seems somewhat flimsy in the bottom corners.  Other than that the buttons are responsive and this makes it so much easier to type on my surface pro than using the touchscreen keyboard.
4,I like the Alcantara but it's not sufficiently better thank the "regular" type cover to warrant 5 stars.  If Amazon had a 4.5 stars that's what I'd award.That said I would buy it again.  A nice cover and matches well with my SP4.
5,If you own a surface pro 3 tablet and you are a poor student like me who cannot afford the new surface I strongly recommend this keyboard.It is an amazing improvement over the old model.I can now finally use my surface like a real laptop and type documents effectively.Also if you still have some cash left I also strongly recommend buying the new stylus for the same reasons.
5,Solidly made.  I have been using Surface since Pro 3 and was happy with the old version of keyboard.  But the new keyboard for Pro 4 definitely has made a big leap to a new level.  Very good product.  In addition to its high quality I also love the look.  It's so stylish this is a magnet of attention and compliments.  Highly recommended.
5,Purchased my wife a new SP4 for Xmas. This keyboard is the $***! Awesome Keyboard. Its magnetically fastened  and the touch of it is great. Its doesn't feel like a cheap keyboard and works exceptionally great. the wife hasn't come home to set it but I'm sure she'll Love it! Would Definitely Purchase again and recommend it to everyone. Now shopping for a drop cover that will allow the keyboard!
5,I have had this for a while now and it still works and looks great. It held up over the years.
1,Does not fit surface pro X looks from a distance like it will but does not. Read carefully before you buy. Turns up in search results for the pro x and recommended by Amazon to buy with the pro x but does not fit it.
4,This is a great keyboard. It connects easily with magnets and serves as the cover for the surface pro tablet. My only complaint is the material that was used for the keyboard itself. It seems to attract dirt and is hard to keep clean.
4,I love the type cover. However while it was listed as new there as some type of residue on several of the keys. I suppose it could have been some problem during manufacturing/packaging but my guess is that it is more likely used. Regardless I love the keyboard.
3,It's a nice tablet. As good as a laptop. I'm pissed off because several reveiws said that the pressure sensitivity is good enough to do art on and that's 100% not accurate. You can do crappy little scribbles like what you can do on a Note 5 but nothing actually useful. I'm mostly frustrated that I was mislead about it's capabilities and it's not worth $700 in the slightest. It's as powerful as a $300 laptop so you're paying $400 for a touch screen.
5,Keyboard doesn't able to adjust the contrast and  brightness but the seller was fast and responsive to fix the problem.  I want to buy different color again next time when mark down sale.
5,I have a Surface Pro 3 and was always frustrated by the keyboard.  It was not firm enough and my fingers could not "find" the centerpoint of each key very well.  I just got the new Surface Pro 4 keyboard and it is significant upgrade.  It feels like keyboards on high quality laptops.  It works great with my Surface Pro 3.  Initially the period key was not working so I did a restart and it worked fine.
5,I wasn't expecting much of this type cover since the one for the surface pro 3 wasn't that great however I can honestly say that they truly reinvented it. It has a perfect distance between keys and a very responsive track pad. The magnet is strong as well my surface pro was falling and I could only grab it by the keyboard and it surprisingly stayed attach. I would definitely recommend.
5,I added this to my Surface Pro 3 when the OEM cover started getting 'hicky.'  I really like the improved key spacing and feel as compared to the MS Surface Pro 3 cover.  It is also more rigid then the 3 which comes in handy when working with the Surface Pro on your lap.  The improved glass like surface of the touch pad is much easier to use as well.
3,I purchased this keyboard to replace an older one because the mousepad wasnt working the way I needed it to.  I love the new mousepad on this keyboard it is very responsive and works great.  The keys seem more spacious because I have less type errors because of my "fat fingers syndrome".  The only drawback about this keyboard is that the magnetic isnt as stron as my old only and the keyboard falls flat while typing which is annoying.
5,I bought this item a couple of weeks ago.  It has worked flawlessly from the very beginning.  I looked at a couple of different sources before making this purchase but decided to stick with Amazon.  It was about $15 cheaper with Amazon.  I had to take it up to the Best Buy near me to show them that is was a genuine Microsoft product and not a cheap imitation.
4,Keyboard feels good but zero key does not work at all. Because I am currently outside tbe U.S. Microsoft will not make good on the warranty unless I return the keyboard which would cost me in return shipping almost as much as a new keyboard will cost me.
5,If you have a Surface Pro 3 or 4 then you will definitely want this cover as it is compatible with both models.  The difference with the Surface Pro 4 keyboard cover is they added a little bit of space between the keys on the keyboard and enlarged the trackpad surface area.  I've been using the cover now for a little over a month and feel it greatly enhances the functionality of the Surface Pro 3.
5,Such a vast improvement over the SP3 it's a wonder what Microsoft was doing for the past 3 generations. I mean it's a pretty crappy typing experience but compared to the other generations its like nirvana. Seriously Microsoft where could you NOT have drawn experience from? How did you go so wrong?Thankfully you used scissor switches like on many ultrabooks and apple laptops. They are actually not bad to type on.And the trackpad is finally an acceptable size
5,Everything they've said about this is true.  Much better keyboard than the original type cover.  Has backlight solid feel larger track pad and works with Surface Pro 3 (which I am using it with right now to type this review).  If you do any typing at all this is worth the investment.
5,I had previously ordered and used another key board for a few years.  I threw in the towel when many of the letters stopped working.  What a joy to work on a key board (genuine Microsoft) that works and looks really attractive.
5,keyboard is sturdy and easy to use. the most important thing i like is the key pad. curser moves easily and stays in place. great product. a bit pricey but if you can afford it this is the one.
5,So far I am very pleased with this type cover. I have a surface pro 3 and it functions well with it even though it is made for the surface pro 4. It is much easier to type on because the keys are spread further apart. Feels more like a real keyboard than the pro 3 and I make less typing errors. This is such an improvement from the older version!
4,Producto como la descripción
5,Bought this renewed product and after 3 months of use the battery lost about 30 minutes before dying. I can not recommend buying.
4,This is actually the first laptop sized keyboard I've lived with and I have no real complaints.  I'm hardly a keyboard connoisseur but I do enjoy the sound the keys make as well as their feel.  I often wish I could get the backlight to stay on a bit longer.
4,Love the concept of snap on keyboard  it's responsive and a must have for surface owners. I took a star off because it's not very sturdy I can feel it bend when I type especially on my lap .
5,Surprisingly good cover.  Good key response better than average trackpad (for a thin detachable). I looked at non-Microsoft equivalents. Cheaper yes but either not as stiff/durable or the keys/trackpac didn't have the same feel. Or some combo of the above.  Have used for hours using Office. Maybe not as good as full size keyboard but just as good as my previous laptops (including a ThinkPad).
5,This keyboard is very nice. It is very quiet when you type on it so you don't feel like you're clacking away when in public. It's also very thin and acts as the cover for your Surface Pro and I've had no trouble with it so far. It's really nice and it should be at that price. Overall really nice product.
5,This keyboard works perfectly with my MS Surface Pro
5,I love the type cover for the surface. Even more Im super glad the keyboard had a back-light for times of low viability. IT snaps on easy to the surface on operated flawlessly. Great little design and the track pad is a vast improvement from the previous. (Do note: Im graduating from a surface one to this so...........yeah) Great addition to the surface I recommend it highly.
4,The way that keyboard linked to the Surface is amazing. The things that I didn't like it are:1. Sometimes the space button is not responding like other buttons. The words becomes linked to each others2. When you disconnect the device from the tablet without shutting down the muse not responding
4,The Surface Pro 4 keyboard is still alittle hard to use but it's light years better than what MSFT was releasing with the Surface 3 and prior.  I love the raised keys and the spacing and the function lock is a welcomed feature as well.
4,Sometimes it's not very responsive but i like it over all easy to attach pretty color and keypad feels nice to type on
5,Well it works! Not sure what else to say about this thing.  The trackpad is light years ahead of my Power Cover that I have for my Surface Pro 2.  Keys are nice and responsive backlighting is good if you like that sort of thing good spacing.Overall its a nice keyboard.  Wish it had a built in battery to extend the life of the SP4 but that's another story.
5,Great keyboard. I am using it now on my Surface Pro 4. I also purchased one for a Surface Pro 3. It is durable and types well.There is some play if you accidentally hit the mousepad but not enough to deduct the rating. The only negative is the price. The technology does not warrant the high price but there are really no other alternatives.
5,Excellent part only thing I don't like is the sueded surface may not stay clean or be easy to clean
4,Worked well until it suddenly stopped working
5,Love it. Only "issue" is that the keyboard is at a slight angle  and keypad is slightly bendable so you have to type gently or it will warp. I really can't fault the product for that though because it is so thin and goes with the surface pro which is not exactly made to be as sturdy as a laptop. Good buy.
5,Exactly what I was needing - the new model and a replacement to what I already had.  Had my previous one for 2 years and traveled with it HARD.  So wanted an upgrade to make it feel new again.  Cool.  Thanks.
5,What is not to like about this upgraded MSP4 Type cover! Big improvement over the Pro 3 type cover. Lights up bigger spacing very responsive. Only issue I had was after long use the Surface Pro 4 stop connecting to it and I had to do a restart by holding the volume key and power key. Not sure why it disconnected but I think it is a Windows 10 problem and not a type cover problem.
5,I love this keyboard.  The keys are raised enough that you feel you are pressing on them.  They feel like silicone and not hard plastic.  The keys are back lit and they light up when you touch the keys or get close to them.  It is very sturdy and doesn't feel like it will bend with pressure.  Folds up nicely to the surface pro 4.
3,I used the standard Type Cover with my unit for a while.  Read about how much nicer this one is and figured I would give it a shot.  It turns out to feel almost identical to the other unit.  Side by side they are very hard to tell which is which from a touch standpoint.  I am no stranger to Alcantara and it's nice but I dont think its worth the extra spend.
5,Absolutely worth the expense to get this. Makes your surface into a really legit laptop and the keys feel great. It's also backlit so no fear of not being able to see keys in the dark. The track pad is actually nice to use for what it is and the keys feel like they're laid out well. None of them feel too small or inconvenient to get to. Overall very worth the expense.
1,This keyboard would be great if only it lasted longer than a couple months. I have never taken it outside the house never spilled anything on it or dropped it and always used a lap desk while working on my surface pro 4. There are several problems with it:- The keyboard becomes suddenly unresponsive. I have had to shut down the machine and on again multiple times to restore function. Sometimes I have had to detach and reattach the keyboard multiple times to get it to work. not worth my time.- The part of the keyboard which locks into the tablet broke and stripped in two (see attached picture) and now no longer works.For the price this is a bad purchase increasing the cost of owning a surface substantially. i bought this keyboard from Tech and Toys not sure if the issue is with this vendor or microsoft itself. in any case i might just use the surface as a tablet only and get something more heavy duty to use as laptop. a keyboard is more important to me than atouch screen...at least i can get basic work done!
5,Just got my keyboard in the grey color. Works well and looks pretty. Only negative is that it doesn’t have the magnetic edge to snap to the tablet like the original keyboard that came with the surface pro did. Overall good buy.
2,So I like the feel of it - the material the keys and the mousepad for the most part. It loses communication with the Surface Pro every so often so it needs to be unhooked and hooked back in again once or twice and sometimes the computer needs to be restarted so it's hard to tell if it's the computer that is the issue the type cover or both. The whole type cover thing is flimsy and is far from ideal when using on your lap because it bends gets weird issues with the mouse area and then of course the whole computer flops down on top of the cover frequently. I do like the backlighting so I know it's on and the teal color is quite nice.
4,Works great.  I just resent having to purchase it separately - sort of like when the airlines advertise a fare and then tack on $100s in taxes and fees.  Hence the 4 stars instead of 5.
5,Very classy and easy to use keyboard. Much better than the older Microsoft type covers as the keys are better spaced and have better strike as they are a little higher. Material is very soft and gives a classy look to the Surface. Similar to Surface Pro 4 keyboards which are better for typing than the older ones.
5,Finding a Surface Pro keyboard for this price on Amazon was one of those great finds you crow about for awhile. The exact color my girlfriend wanted shipped via Prime and ready to use out of the box. It works great and is exactly what we needed.
5,this is absolutely a blast. I feels amazing when typing feels way better than a apple keyboard. It just make your surface works like a laptop ( be careful that you did not want to put it on you lap though. It will make ipad pro looks s***ty because the typing experience on this keyboard is so enjoyable. i would totally recommend getting this type cover even if it is overpriced.
3,I bought the red typecover to pair with my Surface Pro 4. Everything is working great and functionality is fine. I've been using it mostly in tablet mode with the cover folded back and as you can see in the photo it's rubbing off above the track pad and in the bottom right hand corner. It's actually rubbing off in a few other places but when I rubbed them the color blended back in to red but won't last long.
4,There are improvements from the Pro 4 Type Cover but this cover does not have magnets that are as strong as the earlier version and it does give some problems to keep the keyboard at an angle
5,Love this surface cover purchased it for my new Surface Pro 2017 and is so much nicer to use than the cover I had with my Surface Pro 3. Key travel is excellent and I love the backlight for each key. Its comfortable to type on and I prefer the material over the premium alcatara fabric $150 option.
5,Perfect for what I need it for.  Just recently bought a Surface Pro 4 for the office and it didn't come with a keyboard only a stylus so unless your used to working with a stylus you have to ease into it with a keyboard then transfer over.  Got it the next day on a Saturday and it's just right.
4,Very tactile. But for 100 plus dollars it's a bit expensive. Only bug is sometimes when connected to my surface pro 3 the track pad bugs out. Cursor goes crazy and reconnecting will usually fix it.
5,It's a pretty neat designed keyboard cover. I just wished that it wasn't basically a flap as in they didn't add anything to make it stay on the screen when closed. There's only magnets on the side that connects to the screen leaving the other side a free bird! Other than that it works the way it's supposed to so 5-stars for that.
5,This keyboard was a little expensive but after  seeing how nice it looked and feels  was told that will age even nicer than regular surface keyboards we used it for a month and were very happy. It looks very nice and compliments the  look of my wife's surface 4.  Price is a little high but very much worth it imo. Take Care
5,Purchased an open box one of these keyboards from ebay and it did not work right. Purchased this keyboard new from amazon for $14 more than the ebay one and it works perfect.
5,A luxury accessory for the Surface Pro 4 but well worth the cost. The Alcantara fabric really is soft to the touch and the "felt" mélange coloration is an elegant match to the Surface. Functionality is going to be the same as the standard Type Cover but for the same price as the standard through Blutek I opted to go for elegance.
5,I love my keyboard. It works perfectly. The touch pad is smooth and the keys feel great. I love the combo of my surface pro 6 and this keyboard to create a book-like closure. So happy with my purchase
5,I bought this after I spilled fruit juice on my Pro 3 type cover (oops)...and I love it! I like the fact that the keys are spaced out on this keyboard as opposed to being squished together like on the Pro 3 cover and the keys themselves seem much sturdier. I would recommend this as a replacement for any surface keyboard replacement!
5,Typing on this keyboard/cover has been a pleasure. The key spacing and travel are just right. I am not a great typist but with this keyboard I can type without staring at my fingers. The only surprise was that the back-lit thing isn't on all the time just when you are typing apparently. Not a big deal. Maybe I missed how it can be adjusted?
4,My one disappointment is that the keys aren't backlit.. when I read the reviews I saw they were but I most not have gotten the right one. A huge downfall for me but otherwise it's good quality.
5,Got to replace my surface pro 3 keyboard that my 2 year old pulled some of the keys off. He can't pull the keys of this one! Superb design overall better keyboard than the pro 3! Love my surface pro 3 fortunately I have had no battery issues.i get long battery life but I use for school and write papers with it mostly.
5,A revolutionary keyboard to say the least. I have never loved any keyboard as much as the surface cover. It honestly makes me want to type more because of the smooth and quick action of the keys. Perfect length between keys and the backlight just adds the perfect touch.
5,This item replaced a Surface 4. It is faster even at I5 processor than a suface 4. I am happy with the purchase which needs the addition of a keyboard
5,Great update over the old SP3 type cover. Much better key travel a more firm yet quiet key press better spacing on the keys and better back lighting. The track pad is bigger and supports basic gestures.  I bought the black cover thinking it would be a jet black style but was happy to learn it was a light charcoal black and very soft.
5,I purchased this keyboard to be used with my Surface Pro 3.  The mouse pad is smoother to the touch and smoother on the screen than the older keyboards.  Typing is also easier and more natural with the newly designed keys.  I highly recommend the upgrade - I am very thankful for the backward compatibility.
5,The black surface keyboard is by far the best color. I had the grey keyboard previously and didn’t enjoy my experience but the black keyboard changed that. The texture is different and far better. I’d highly recommend it.
5,This keyboard is absolutely rock solid compared to the Surface 3 and Surface Pro 3. The key lighting is adjustable on several levels and can be very bright. Also found the mouse surface to be very smooth and solid. Doesn't seem to transfer oils to the screen face as badly as prior models. Very comfortable key travel with a satisfying click at the bottom of travel.
5,This works great! I love how easily it attaches/comes off. The only thing I don't like is that you don't get the right 1/3 of a normal size keyboard ( numbers/arrows/some function keys/ +- ) but there's really no room for it with the size of the tablet
5,This type cover was a great buy. It works well and the texture provides comfort the touchpad and keyboard are amazing it's very similar to typing on a regular PC keyboard.
3,Two issues:1. Right click does not always work. Sometimes it needs a harder press to work.2. The back side (in contact with the table) is a dust magnet. I live in a country where volcanic ash is everywhere so it looks nasty already. No idea how to clean it.The positive:- typing feels great.- function buttons are correctly placed and intuitive.- is a must for protection of the screen when stored.
3,Does the product work? Yes no issues or concerns there...My only issue is that this product was listed as “Very Good”. I think the pictures will dictate otherwise...If I were to have seen the condition prior to purchase I would hav just paid for a “New” product.
5,This option makes the Surface Pro worth keeping. The surface Pro should come with this option because this unit is designed to replace your laptop and without this the unit is just another windows tablet. The keyboard protects the screen and makes the surface tablet easier to grip while carrying. It does leave hand oils on the screen it the shape of the keys.
5,I got this keyboard gently used and it looks brand new. The keys all work great as well as the track pad. It works really well as a cover when closed and it is nice to have a keyboard for the Surface Pro 4. The backlight is nice to have for the evenings when it is darker.
5,Snaps magnetically right into place with the Surface Pro's contacts and holds well.The extra magnetic bar at the top helps the tablet figure out if you're into tablet mode or laptop mode nice!Key response is perfect and the touchpad is accurate.Both lightweight and durable this keypad cover is perfect!10/10
4,Giving 4 stars because it's overpriced for a keyboard.  But the performance and quality is great and much better than the previous Surface type cover.
5,I spilled coffee on my original SurfacePro4 keyboard and ordered this one as my current coffee logged keyboard was in the throws of death.  It came 2 days later and viola I'm back up and running.  I'd buy it again.
5,Works perfectly for my Surface Pro 4. I put off buying one of these because I had a bad experience with the similar type of keyboard with my old Surface Pro 2 but now I am really glad I have this keyboard with my Surface Pro 4.
5,bought it as a gift for my brother because his keyboard malfunctioned. works as expected and he loves it!
5,So far so good! It looks really good and is much sturdier than the one that I originally got with the Pro3. I had to replace my keyboard because the trackpad on my old one got warped and was causing issues. This one doesn't seem like it would have that problem with prolonged use but I'll update if it does.
4,Cute and matches other Surface products; glad they got it all coordinated! Only gets 4 stars because it feels very flimsy. It's meant to be slim which is great but it's not sturdy. Love the magnetic clip in though!
5,This keyboard has the best feel of any tablet keyboard I have used for touch typing and it is lightweight.With my former Windows tablet I used to leave the keyboard at home when I went on backpacking trips to Europe because it added too much weight to my pack. Now that I own a Surface Pro with this keyboard I intend to take the keyboard with me.
5,Hola. Estuvo bien por 7 meses. Necesito hablar con el proveedor
4,I returned this item in error. It turned out to function correctly and it was our tablet that had a faulty connector.
4,The keyboard feels nice and the trackpad is good. It connects seamlessly and just works. My only small complaint is that it doesn't magnet shut on the top of the surface.
5,Awesome keyboard. Works very well with surface pro tablet. I couldn't use my tablet to the fullest without it. I highly recommend for anyone who will be using their tablet like a laptop in any capacity. My only regret is that it does not light up.
1,We purchased this a few years ago and it seemed to last but suddenly certain keys stopped working. So we figured it was time to replace (I know electronics don't last as long as we all would like) it.  So we purchased this and 5 months later it is doing the same thing as the first one.  Of course it is past the return policy so I have no recourse but to purchase another one.  I would think it should have lasted longer than 5 months! I am hoping to find a different one to try - one that will last longer.
5,Overall this is a great keyboard the reaction he is fairly quick service is natural to type. It reminded me of an apple keyboard. I love that you simply click on the keyboard on the surface automatically sync to the keyboard. There is no need for battery. The  fabric like material is very soft.
5,I love the color and it's cheaper to buy this item from here than the microsoft store!!!!!! (even with the student discount) I was scared that it wasn't a real one or it was a knock off one. It's great no problems yet. The keyboard is much better than SP3 keyboard because the keys are more spaced out
5,Excellent.  I like the way; it connects to the tablet - as a magnet; no snapping it in and no worries about it not connecting properly.  I have a Samsung tablet that developed a short and has that connection problem...It self-illuminates automatically in dark lighting situations.  No need to play with settings.
5,So far so good! I haven't used it but 2 weeks and it replaced one that mysteriously disappeared from my office while I was out for surgery.. BUT... I like the bigger size as the smaller original was fairly useless for typing (and after all that is what it is supposed to do!). Hopefully things continue as they are just fine!
5,The new Type Cover is most definitely an improvement over the previous Surface Pro 3 generation. The keys really feel good and there are additional levels for the backlit key brightness. The trackpad is also improved/larger than the previous generation - it's more responsive. All in all it's a good companion purchase (though if you already own the Surface Pro 3 keyboard this is not "revolutionary" but evolutionary.
3,The keyboard is comfortable to type on and I love the color (I have teal). The magnetic connection to the Surface is very secure and stable. On functionality alone it would be 5 stars but the material shows wear very easily and is beginning to discolor on the keyboard side after only a month of use. The typing experience is good but at this point I don't think it's going to last as long as a $100 keyboard should.
5,Worth it. Every Penny. Feels better than the keys and trackpad on my 2011 13'' Macbook Pro. (not as good as the configuration on my wife's 2015 MBP but close).Still has some give/flex and it's not totally silent but it's much more quiet and sturdy than the surface pro 3 typecover.KEY Features completely overlooked and underrated by other reviewers:- Sound Keys (Up DOWN and Mute)
5,I'm waiting for a bit to write my review on the Surface but i can already tell that this is an amazing product.Extremely responsive keyboard and track pad immediate connection to the tablet and a small crevice for your pen to be placed!It's pretty frikin expensive yeah but in my opinion a necessary accessory!
5,This keyboard is sleek and comfortable under my fingertips. I haven't had any trouble with it at all. I bought a touch cover keyboard first which wouldn't even connect but this type keyboard is much much better. However these are WAY too pricey. I bought a better GAMING keyboard for my PC that is cheaper than these type covers. Yikes.
2,I take pretty good care of my things. And to be honest I thought I got an excellent keyboard with this. I did know I was taking a risk buying refurbished but like I said I take pretty good care of my things.That didn't really matter though. I purchased this July 21 and Today is September 18. Just under 2 months old and the 'S' key popped off while typing.  These are great keyboards but I am hard-pressed to say that going refurb is a fantastic idea.  Guess I'll see how helpful with seller will be.
5,Feels amazing. Must have for the Surface Pro. You can have surface as a tablet but it does feel good to have the keyboard the keyboard itself feels really good. The touchpads are sensitive and on par with the MacBook touchpads. Also if you don't want to scratch your surface why not buy the keyboard that also acts as a cover.
5,Stopped working after 5 months.  No warning just one minute fine one minute dead.  Shame because it had a great feel.  Enjoyed it while it worked.EDIT:  Turned out my Surface was defective.  Returned for a new one and the type cover was fine.
5,I really love this Type Pad for my Surface Pro 4. The other pads have a non-slip type of rubber/plastic that will eventually get dirty and wear down due to the hand resting on it. This type pad has a harder surface that will not wear down and it is also really good looking.
5,Still using this keyboard after 9 months and it works! love the versatility of using my SurfacePro as a normal computer and durability since it's held up like new. I travel and put this keyboard directly into my briefcase daily and it still looks and works like I purchased it that day. Highly recommend this product.
3,Bought slightly used from seller. Where the screen and keyboard connect the plastic was visibly dirty. The cover has a sticker residue patch about 1" x 2" that's pretty visible. Functionality of the keyboard is fine.
5,Very light and easy to carry. The magnets are much better than I expected. I travel a lot and good in very tiny spaces like in the air plane.The back lit light is excellent on the key board so very helpful in the dark again in the air plane. Handy helpful gadget.
4,It's a nice keyboard. It is very light thin and compact. It's a shame that I had to return it as my Surface pro stopped working!
1,I want to love the Type Cover because in theory it is great.  In practice not so great.  The main problems with the type cover:1. The the track pad is horrible... remember the really crappy trackpads that were standard 10+ years ago?  This reminds me of those.  I can't make a circle with the cursor without it lagging and glitching out.2. It's very buggy.  I don't know if this is the Surface's fault or the Type cover but almost every time I go to use the cover it isn't detected for a really long time.  I usually have to reattach it 3-4 times before it registers.3. It doesn't register gestures/key stokes far too often.  I'll have to hit a key over 3 times to get it to register and soft clicking hardly ever works.Maybe I expected too much of the type cover...  but I find myself using the touch screen keyboard over this which is really disappointing because the touch screen keyboard is a pain.
5,I don't know what this suede-like material is but it is fantastic. It is so nice to touch and the color is mellow and pleasing. I worried it would get dirty too easily but so far a regular wipe with a dampened cloth cleans it up perfectly (no soaps or cleaning solutions). The touch and feel while typing is also very good. Highly recommended
4,Keyboard was what to expect. Sleek and functional.I am happy with the product and you should be if you are looking for a simple design.
5,I wore out my original type coverDue to extreme abuse it seems to meBut this new one that I just acquiredIs a beautiful work of art you see.
5,Hands down the best accessory you can add to your surface pro.  I loved my surface before this and once this showed up I couldn't imagine not having it.  This is something IMO that should be included with the purchase.  But since it is not you wont be sorry for adding it.
5,Coming from the Surface 3 type cover this is a worthwhile upgrade. The trackpad is greatly improved as is the keyboard. They've added new function keys (including function lock) like volume up and down and the spaced out keyboard feels much more natural. The added rigidness also helps set this one a part. If you're looking for a nice upgrade I highly recommend it!
5,A must have for the Surface Pro 3/4/2017... very nifty and excellent mouse pad size and feel and operability... having a PrntScr button is a really good feature and the backlighting is fantastic I can now work totally in the dark or soft ambient lighting with great ease.
5,Love this new Type cover.  Especially the larger keys.  Great value & quality!
4,Needed a new cover. Decided on the one with the nice finish this time. Plugged in and worked just fine as expected. Like the nice feel again as expected
1,I'e only used this for one semester of school (~6months)  and now some of the keys are not reliably responsie. The typos you see in this reiew are due to me not being able to type some of the letters. You'd think for oer $100 it would last at least one shool year. If not for the keyboard stop responding at times this would be a good keyboard. Like the other negative reviews on here the downfall of this keyboard is depending on the day it may or may not respond. And some keys will permanently become nonresponsie. The touchpad does the same thing.I carry this keyboard inside a case always. And never eat or spill anything around/on it. I tried cleaning it taking it off putting it on restarting computer. nothing fixes the non responding keys. Wish I could get a replacement for this crap. This is not worth $100. If the manufacturers anticipate that a small fraction of the keyboards they sell would be defective they should have some money back offer.
2,Great while it lasted which was a year and about two months... right past warranty expiration :( then one of the connectors would continually "sink in" and the type cover wouldn't connect to the surface pro. I can manually coax it up and get it to connect but it only lasts a little while before falling down again. Unfortunately since the warranty has expired I'll have to buy a new one. Pretty bummed it didn't last even a year and a half.Side note: Microsoft customer service was easy to get in touch with but basically just said you'll have to buy a new one.
3,Good cover. Convenient. Looks really cool.It's a bit on the expensive side for what it is and in its angled position (when not flush against the surface it is on) it will bend slightly while typing which will cause it to register the wrong keys at times or cause the touchpad to be jumpy and register false clicks. This is especially problematic if you attempt to use it on your lap. Just not gonna happen.
5,The slight change in key spacing makes this a huge improvement over the previous-generation SP3 Type cover. With the old one the closely spaced keys impaired my typing speed and accuracy to the point that I wouldn't/couldn't take my SP3 on business trips. Now I'm starting to agree with Microsoft: the Surface Pro is the tablet that not just can but will replace my laptop.
4,Nice keyboard. I still need to try it out. The only comment I have to make so far is that the color "Black" (what I purchased) looks more like grey color.
4,Fits perfectly. Buttons feel great. Suede feels awesome. Track pad works great. It is however pretty expensive for a keyboard with track pad.This is a necessary accessory for Surface Pro 4.
5,Excelente buenos acabados muy cómodo.
5,Great little keyboard and cover for the wife's Surface Pro that I picked up for her. The keys have a surprisingly nice feel that I didn't expect when we ordered it. Seems to be very durable and holds up very nicely to day to day use.
3,Good product but I'll be the millionth person to say that it should have been included with the computer - like just about every other computer in the world. But as a product it works very well - has a nice feel and I can type faster on it than on my large desk keyboard.
5,This keyboard is great keyboard it was easy to setup. The keys depress very well. Excellent sensitivity scrolling clicking and trackpad.
5,My favorite of the Surface Type Covers. It's the most classy and wears better than the others. Believe it or not I find there is a difference in the typing experience. To me this model has quieter keys with better travel. Its a little more money but I think its worth it. Surface rocks!
2,I liked that its detachable protects the screen.  I thoroughly dislike that just carrying it from car to door and back again the letter "V" came off (I never found it)...Microsoft Rep at the store in Charlotte SC told me no one or place with Microsoft could send me just that letter and the only way I could fix the problem was to spend another $129 and change on another keyboard.  I postively HATE the online keyboard..perhaps it's just  me but I have to hit the screen with major pressure for the characters to register in whatever I am typing they don't imprint by simple tapping.
5,This type cover is by far one of the best I've used. I saw that a finger print reader version was also available but don't see the point (for Surface Pro 4 anyways). With Windows hello I doubt I ever would have used the finger print reader. Maybe its for older Surface devices that don't have the Hello camera capabilities?
5,It works well strong magnet to connect to the surface pro. the mouse pad is very sensitive you need to barely touch it to make a selection as opposed to tap it (if you are used to a mac's mouse pad). the keys are very ergonomic.
5,Love this keyboard definetly do not hesitate to buy. I use it for my surface 3 (yes thats the regular 3 not pro version). Despite what you read it is compatible even though the physical size is bigger. I do not mind this physical size difference as its not that much bigger. It's just like a mac keyboard and feels really smooth.
5,Got this cover for my new Surface Pro 4 to replace my old Surface Pro 2. And... I can tell the difference - how much more comfortable this new keyboard is - with shape with touch and slight elevation!!! Nice color which keeps me calm and concentrated during my work.
3,I bought this product on december and it worked perfectly for about 3 months. After that it will sometimes lose connection with the computer then the metal things that connect the keyboard to the computer stopped working and now I have tried every possible solution out there but my keybaord no longer works
4,Its nice in touch. Feels very close to normal laptop keyboard. I have been using it for 2 months now dint notice any issues. Track pad is smooth and sensitive.
5,I just purchased Surface Pro 4. I thought keyboard or screen protector comes with it until I read fine print. With touch and the pen had no problem I wanted the over anyway. The cover knows it's function and where to go. Smart product and delivery was second to none. Jk
2,Spilled coffee on existing type cover and it still works but some of the keys are sticky even though it's been like a couple months. Bought this to replace it but unfortunately had to send it back because some of the keys didnt function. If I flattened the top edge instead of letting it sit across bottom edge of screen then more keys worked but there were still some crucial keys that just didnt work at all like volume down and space bar as well as some letters. Got an Alcantara keyboard elsewhere instead for same price I paid for this (but not from Amazon).
5,Quick set up. Snapped in place. It uses the tablets power so no charging needed. Love the lighted keyboard.
5,Bought as a replacement. Great product
5,Original Microsoft product. Very nice keyboard. I was able to test drive a Microsoft keyboard at my local Bestbuy. Functions just as expected. Great price. Prompt delivery. Very pleased with purchase. I posted an earlier review and incorrectly noted late delivery. Was actually delivered on time. However I did submitted an excellent rating then as well.
5,This keyboard is great. It is functional and the keys don’t get stuck when you’re pressing them.
5,I didn't expect the keyboard to have such a good feel.  Much better than the Vaio laptop I replaced.  The magnet really snaps onto the Surface Pro 4.  Not a big fan of the touchpad with the integral buttons.  Hard to keep the mouse pointer still when clicking.  I generally use an external mouse.
5,Works very well and just completes the Surface i used the surface without it for 6 months and it is just so much better with! I've had this for 8 months and still doing great!:)
5,Fantastic - worth the upgrade for my Surface Pro 3. The button spacing is better and much easier to use the touch pad sensitivity is much better and makes the old Surface Pro 3 keyboard feel clunky and cheap. If you have a Pro 3 - this is worth the upgrade!
5,teclado excelente y facil de usar y conectar.
5,This was a great buy fits my surface pro 4 great. Neat feature is that the keyboard does light up when attached to the surface. I wasn't aware it did that until I started using it. The mouse on the key pad also works nicely. Would purchase again at this point.
5,The keyboard feels as good as new very easy to use very smooth and lightweight. I can't wait to use it for school! I am very satisfied with my purchase especially for the price I bought it.
5,This thing is amazing. It feels like a high quality laptop keyboard complete with backlighting and everything. Looks good too I played it safe and went with black. The track pad is also the best I've used on a Windows machine. Highly recommended. Only complaint is that it's expensive and not included with the Surface Pro 4.
3,It gets the job done but for me the biggest problem is that the mouse pad will occasionally click while in the middle of typing. This moves the cursor as well as highlights unnecessarily. I don't think this product is worth $90 in the least but it lights up which is a pro for typing in the dark and like I said it gets the job done.
2,I was happy with this keyboard because it has backlit keys and charges via the Surface. BUT it quit working after a year.  I didn't use it daily either. These keyboards are hard to find and at a reasonable price.  I wish
4,It even has a print-screen button now!  I wish I could have gotten this keyboard with my Surface Pro 3 because its keys were too close together. Don't buy the Surface Pro 3 Type Cover!
5,Waterproof. Firm confident tactile feedback on every key. Great touchpad that is as responsive as using the full touch screen. Strong magnet that jumps in place and stays put. Smart enough to disable itself when folded all the way back and up. In step with the surprisingly un-Microsoft elegant smart design of the Surface Pro. Love this thing.
5,I've had this for almost 2 months now and I still love it.What bothers me about this is that the trackpad is not in the middle where the space bar is. It's off to the right side. Not a big deal though.Pros: Smooth Easy to use and New.Cons: Gets dirty easily
5,I bought the black Surface Pro 4 Type Cover and i think it looks better in hand than in the picture. The trackpad is excellent the best I have used though I have never owned a laptop that cost more than $1000 before buying the surface pro 4. It feels premium like a $130 worth accessory & the backlight is also great.
4,Gets dirty super easy. The reasoning behind why microsft chose felt as the texture is beyond me. Otherwise its a great keyboard the feel the look the functionality all great.
5,the right keyboard for the surface pro 4. i will say awesome. the construction  the size the key respond is flawless you don't even finish to touch it and you feel the feed back response back right after the touch.
4,Seems a bit glitchy sometimes but still really nice and I love the colour. Thanks
3,it types OK however I am use to using my Surface pro while in my recliner with a case on it so that I can adjust the position. this keyboard is very cumbersome trying to type in this position. I tried with and without the case and it still is very awkward using. Have not decided what I am going to do with it. So far I am still using the on screen keyboard.
4,The keyboard arrived quickly and was functional. Unfortunately the device it goes with crashed and was defective.  I recommend the seller just not happy with the device it paired with.
5,Excellent durability and build quality of the keyboard.Light weight adds to the aesthetic appeal of this device.Would love to see a Bluetooth connected version of the same that can work with other laptops as well as be away from the Surfaces base device.
5,I used a another keyboard that was not a OEM keyboard for a while. while it worked ok it had some glitches particularly with the touch pad. this one works perfectly and while it is more expensive I wish I had just bought it originally.
5,Purchased for my SP3 perfect by thus far have been using it for about a week and it is perfect. The keyboard and track pad feel kind of like a Chromebook key board and track pad. Back light is pretty neat I just wish the keyboard doubled as a battery pack it certainly should at $115
4,It's way better than Pro 3 keyboard and feels great! However I don't want to give 5 stars because you also have to spend extra money to buy this (Pro 4 itself is costly enough!!)
5,I have been using this keyboard with my surface pro for quite an amount of time now and I have to say it’s quite a decent equipment. No need to go in detail overall this is a great product.
5,I have the pro 3 type cover and now that I just got the pro 4 this type cover is great. The touchpad is larger and still very easy to use. The keyboard itself is very smooth and easy to type on. I have also used it in a dark room so the lit up keys are great as well.
3,I like the type cover it.  One con to it seems that when its attached my pro glitches sometimes.  The screen won't come on or i can't touch the screen as it wont respond to me.  It never happens when the cover isn't attached so I'm unsure if I got a lemon one or what.  It is easy to type on and I like how it's sleek.
4,Great cover. Works and fits right on my SP4. On the blue color dirt is noticeable. I should have bought a darker color but I like blue too.
4,good one fits with Microsoft Surface pro. It does what is need to but a small downside is hard to clean it.
4,The keys feel great but the keyboard is still significantly narrower than a normal keyboard and makes my shoulders a bit cramped when I use it.
5,This is a great keyboard. It makes the Surface Pro 4 a great replacement for a laptop.  Some reviews have had problems with the track pad but mine works great. It also protects the screen very well. Once I got this I took off the case because I felt that I didn't need it any longer.
5,Has a strong magnet that stays on well.  Comes off when needed but can tolerate handling and being passed around without fear of it disconnecting.  Good feel when typing nice resistance (tactile feedback) of the keys.  Would buy again.
3,Ordered for my Surface pro 2017 but shipper sent me Surface pro 4 instead. And while this does work without issues I only realized this was NOT a Surface pro 2017 when a computer geek friend of mine pointed out the keyboard layout is different. Guess just disappointed I didn't get what I ordered.
5,Love this keyboard over the original Surface Pro 3 keyboard.  Better layout locked Function Key nice spacing and great key press feel.  Highly recommend if you are still on the old version.
5,These things work great and add a finished look to the Surface.  I've never had any issues with it except for when the kids(or wife) spill food/crumbs on it.  Wish I didn't have to buy it separate from the surface but that's no reflection on quality or Amazon.
5,This keyboard is amazing by far the most comfortable keyboard of this size I have ever used. The arrow keys should have had a bit more room from the sides to find them faster but everything else is just superb.
5,Much better than the Surface Pro 3 type cover which was already very good for a device like this. The new one excels with the larger super smooth touch pad and more discrete keys with a bit better response. Also has a better fold to the screen which leaves a larger gap between keyboard and screen for easier touch.
5,Outstanding upgrade to the Surface Pro keyboard series.  The keyboard quality is the same high quality (especially for such a thin cover for your Surface Pro) and makes for fantastic typing but the alcantara classes things up to the next level.  Great job Microsoft!!!
5,Very cool product - really like the feel of the keys and the size is nice. I was worried about it being too flimsy (I press really hard and fast when I type) but it is solid.  LOVE the color - very zippy without being obnoxious.
5,Awesome keyboard. Works as it should. Track pad is perfect. No issues what so ever. It may be awkward to work on your lap but I use my bag as a "desktop". Issue solved! Great value! Also the vendor shipped this out incredibly fast. Got it next day!! Incredible transaction.
3,I bought and returned this product 3 times. The keys were not backlit. I finally took the 3rd to my local Microsoft store and they exchanged it for me. Service on Amazon was great and I got refunded in a timely manner just the product did not work as specified. Love the keyboard one I got one that worked.
5,They made great fixes or upgrades to this keyboard. The better spaces between the keys is a huge improvement! It's just like typing on a regular PC keyboard. Love this blue color; looks great with the matching blue Microsoft wifi mouse.
5,Very pleased with the keyboard/ cover.  I think it's essential if you have a Surface Pro.  The keyboard has a nice feel.  The mouse pad is very responsive.  I waited several months before I purchased a mouse and really didn't miss having it.
5,Purchased a $200 keyboard for my desktop and I prefer using this one. Might just stop using a desktop all together.
5,This is a must have if you have a Surface product. I also have a 2016 MacBook Pro and this keyboard is WAY better than that. The key travel is really good for something this thin and light. The trackpad is also excellent.
4,Works perfectly. Love the lighted keys. Keyboard has a seam around the edge that is a little annoying but I am typing on it right now.
4,Have connection issues once in a while where the keyboard just wouldn't respond.Seems to be a long existing issue that still need to be fixed by software updatesOther times works great
1,Product was sealed in its box but cannot be recognized by windows citing hardware errors communicating with the device.
3,I bought this for my Surface Pro 4 and it worked great for a time. After a year it started glitching pretty bad and now the mouse constantly shakes on the screen when I move it freezes and jumps around.
4,It came right away. I only notice a problem which is the mouse pad sometimes doesn't work properly but all in all everything s fine.
5,Much Much better than the SP3 cover. Love the key spacing compared to the more cramped SP3 cover. Trackpad is now glass and larger. Multi touch gestures like double tap for right click are sometimes intermittent. Overall amazing cover seems more rigid than the old SP3 cover as well.
5,The keyboard is improved since the one I bought a few years ago for a previous Surface Pro model.  It does what it's supposed to do.  The red helps my tell the difference between this Surface and my work device.
5,I really like the Surface Pro 4. Works better for online college than my MacBook. I have to say that the seller is fantastic. The first Surface they sent froze up the day I got it. None of the reboots worked. They sent another one right away. Great customer service.
4,It really can replace the laptop. Needs to be updated with the latest O.S updates which I would give 8.5 out of 10 The hardware is solid screen resolution is makes everything crisp.
5,This is a gift for my daughter. She loves it. It is everything she needs.
5,Love it!  Have a SP3 but wanted the keys to be spaced a little more (fat fingers).  But I do a lot of typing.  This was a dream come true.  Otherwise pretty much the same as the Pro 3 type cover.
3,The Type cover from Microsoft is functionally great.Then why I gave only 3 stars? The product came in a lose pack and somehow I have a feeling that I may have received an open pack or used one. Since the product is in good condition I have not complained. But back in my mind I still feel that I received an open pack.
5,I love the magnetic connection and that it doesn't add significant bulk to my Surface Pro 4.  The keys feel great and provide a great typing experience.  (I only bought this separately because the Surface Pro 4 package price was higher).
5,I absolutely love this keyboard! You can adjust the backlighting for when you're typing in the dark etc. It attaches perfectly with a magnet so it is as easy as ever! It detaches just as easily and so far I have never encountered a connection problem!
4,Sometimes it's unresponsive.  But most of the time it works fine.  -1 star for the unreliability.  Overall it's a pleasure typing and mousing around on this (when it's working).
3,I am using this cover sine 3 months Every thing is good but I am facing the issue of three buttons in the keyboard. Three buttons( "C" "F2" and "2 or @") are not working. These buttons are disconnected from the laptop. Because of this every time i need to use touch keyboard option. I feel very sad for this issue.
5,I needed a new type cover after the one I got with my Surface Pro 4 wore out. I was glad to find this color!
5,Recently upgraded to a Surface Pro4 from a Surface Pro2...this keyboard is a MAJOR improvement....responsive the track pad actually works and works well and I love the ability to raise the keyboard up so it is more ergonomic...I hated the fact that the Pro2 Keyboard was so flat...great add on and upgrade!
5,I really like the teal colored type cover that I received. I use it with a Kensington Blackbelt 2nd Degree Rugged Case and it fits perfectly with it. Super convenient when I'm on the go and don't want to use the screen keyboard.
4,The Microsoft type Cover have excellent quality and useful nice design but the color isn't black. In fact is kind of grey
4,Love this keyboard! Occasionally the screen freezes when connecting and disconnecting the keyboard. But other than that love the feel and look of the keyboard!
4,Product is good.  Touch pad is not too accurate.  Macbooks touch pad are the best.  Nevertheless I use this product on a daily basis.
4,I wish the color was a little bit less shinny but overall nice and well finished!
5,I love that the Surface Pro 4 type cover attaches and detaches so easily. The backlit keyboard is a bonus also and it protects the screen on the Surface Pro 4 from any damages. It's a plus all the way around.
2,I keep needing to restart my computer in order to use this.
4,Key was shipped early connected to tablet as described and has worked flawlessly.  Much improved typing experience over the surface pro 3 keyboard
5,This keyboard is miles ahead of the prior version. The old one had a flimsy feel and terribly small mouse/track area. This one is awesome. Way bigger mouse/track area great brightness on the back light and solid feel when typing.
5,The trackpads on these are a big upgrade.  I came from a Surface Pro 2 and having the print screen key back is a big upgrade too.  Using this one with a Surface Pro 3 with no issues.  Also this color should be called purple in my opinion.
5,Good choice!!cheaper than other sellersGood product
5,This keyboard is awesome!  I love the tactile feeling feeback from the buttons the protection it offers when closed over the surface and high quality back surface.  It feels like a quality leather-like surface.  I really like this keyboard.
4,Beautiful and works well.  Knocked one star off because it gets dirty easily.
5,Performs as advertised.  Very easy to use with the Surface 4.  The connection is easy fast and efficient.  The only thing that would make it better is to be included with the Surface 4...as it is very unlikely anyone would buy it without the keyboard.
4,the only problem I have is the kind of cloth material. It absorbs a lot of dust and particle and its hard to clean too
5,Have the product for some 2-3 years I think and it works well after all this time although seems thin and potentially weak
5,Great keyboard and love the color. This is definitely an upgrade from the old knock off keyboard I bought before decided to shell out the 100 bucks for this. Love the way the typing feels and how the trackpad works great.
5,Works just like the original keyboard. Mine was destroyed by grandkids. Replaced with this one and like it alot. Great produce for my Surface Pro.
5,excellent product
5,I like this keyboard. The surface pro is a great machine. This keyboard is a nice blue that you don't see anywhere else on keypads.
5,Great type cover for my surface pro 4. Love the color
5,Perfect fit and work great.  This appears to be a genuine Microsoft original product.  Very happy with performance fit and apperarance.
5,This is a great keyboard.  I am just as happy using at as I am my full-sized desktop keyboard (except for missing the number pad.)  I was not expecting to be as pleased as I am with it - it's expensive but worth it.
3,It was not in mfg packaging....obviously a knock off of the original. Good price but not Microsoft original
4,The mouse and keys work beautiful. In the back up lights in the keyboard are amazing. The only problem that I have is the mouse clicks too loud.
4,No F keyboard for Turkish letters which is a minus
5,Works just fine with the Surface Pro 3 and feels much better than the SP3 keyboard. The larger trackpad makes a significant difference and the keys feel like typing on a laptop. If you frequently travel with a SP3 this is a worthy upgrade along with the Surface Pro 4 pen.
5,Replacement for 3 year-old well-used keyboard of the same colour. Very pleased with the new one arrived promptly and works as expected.
4,This keyboard is way over priced. But it is original Microsoft and interfaces perfectly with the new Surface Pro 4. Not much of a choice in that !
5,We purchased this for our Surface Pro 3 and it is working like a charm.  Very nice feel to the keyboard.  This makes the Pro work like a laptop when desired and also serves as a protective cover.
5,After using many laptops this keyboard is a step above the rest. It is lightweight durable and easy to remove from the surface. The keys have a tactile feel in the trackpad is a great touch. Microsoft did a great job on this design!
4,Pretty to look at and the feel of the keys are superb. Just wished there are some led lights when typing in the dark
5,The keyboard is so light weight and the keys are so sensitive to touch that I'm typing faster on this keyboard than any other.  Easy to use and I'm very glad I got it to go with my surface Pro 4.
5,I have had not problems using this Keyboard with my surface pro 4 I only wished that it was included with the pro maybe they will as time goes on but it works perfectly for me.
3,I had to get a mouse to use with it because the key pad bothers me so much. The edges of it aren't even with the rest of the keyboard so your fingers hit the sides and it's super annoying. Fine other than that.
1,It don't work
5,This is a great keyboard and very durable.
5,bought and returned no problem once my other pad started to work again!
5,Using it with my Surface Pro 3 and it is by far the best Type Cover out there. Only complaints is that the material on the bottom (assume built for grip) can get a bit dirty but not this is really looking for something bad to say.
5,I have no real issues with it works great and is light weight. The only minor issue I have is that it shows smudges and oil easily on the keys and for my OCD side I have to clean it often.
5,This keyboard connected immediately  to my Surface Pro 4 (as soon as I positioned it correctly).  The keys have a good feel.  response is spot on.  And it looks good.  Very pleased
5,Love this keyboard for my Surface Pro 4.  I feel like the keys and touchpad are perfectly responsive.  The magnet attachment is strong and you can easily flip the keyboard back to hold it as a tablet.
4,I like the keyboard I think it would be much better if they made it in charcoal grey instead of the light grey.
5,Great keyboard easy and comfortable to use
4,Works great I like the functionality it gives my Surface Pro. I just wish it came with it in the package instead of ordering it separately.
5,I can't imagine having a Surface without the type cover! With this it becomes a fully fledged laptop just smaller and lighter. And I love how easy this cover is to take on and off.
4,Good quality and smooth typing. No track mouse mad issues!
5,Was on the fence about the color but that was put to bed upon arrival.  I get so many compliments and "Where did you find that color?" in airports and hotels now.  Very pleased.
5,Must have for your surface. Surface is simply not the thing without this keyboard. its backlit easy to clean (a bit of water on the cloth) and colour is nice
5,Types very easily. Connects without any issues. I recommend to configure options so trackpad doesn't work with mouse connected or typing. This keyboard offers slight protection when closed. Back lit keys are very useful. Overall happy with purchase.
3,It works. It's very light weight. It connects very easily and solidly. That being said it has some idiosyncrasies that are annoying. The mouse pad can only be tapped dead center before it registers. And the keyboard itself doesn't feel substantial -- more like papermache actually -- and not likely to survive much pounding of the keys.
3,The cover has worked well for typing papers and in general online use. The back however becomes easily discolored and dirty. Flipping the keyboard behind the surface also disables the keys so when using photophobia their are two options. Either you draw over the keyboard or flip it back and forth continuously.
4,The system is fantastic. The only issue was the updates they were time consuming. I am aware thatPCs have updates. But I do like the system.
5,Purchased this with my Surface Pro 3 after reading that it was backwards compatible. Works perfectly and didn't have to install any drivers or anything of that nature. I've gotten plenty of compliments on it as well too.
4,comfortable to type on.  the backlighting is a nice touch but the touch pad isn't up to Mac standards.
5,My favorite thing about this is the trackpad. Microsoft made a huge improvement here. All glass trackpad that is bigger and in the center of the keyboard. They also added space between the keys which is really nice. I love this keyboard!
5,Great keyboard. Very comfortable and quiet keys. I was not looking forward to spending this much for a keyboard but after reading the other reviews of the older keyboard line having quality issues I'm glad I splurged.
4,More convenient than a 3rd party bluetooth keyboard.Nice "clicks" to let you know you typed a particular key.
4,Only gripe about the keyboard is that it feels too small.  Maybe I'm just getting used to it coming from my old keyboard. Great product.
3,Nice color and good overall quality but the track pad leaves much to be desired.  It doesn't operate the same as a track pad on a standard laptop.  I also wish there were magnets to keep the cover firmly closed when my Surface is not in use.
5,This is a replacement for the cover/keyboard I got with my Surface originally several years ago. The keys feel better than the original did.
3,This was a replacement for one I bought my son in July. The first one the keys died in about three months. I could not wait to send for the warranty. He uses it for school.. Keys would get stuck or not press at all..
5,I got this to upgrade my SP3.  I love this keyboard so much better than the Type 3 Cover.  The mousepad is way more responsive and the keys just feel better.  This is a great keyboard for the SP3.
5,Types incredibly smooth. Only thing I experienced after a few weeks is that the touchpad stopped working (right now). I read this is a common bug so I assume this will get fixed soon and I won't have to adjust the review :)
5,Great purchase
5,This is so nice the color and it is so light in weight I loved it it is not as bright as the picture but still bright blue
5,Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.
5,I am very satisfied with this product! In the description it said it had minimal damage however I couldn't even tell! It looks brand new and functions as if it was new as well. I am very satisfied with the keyboard. Definitely would order from them again.
5,Great product...and still is for over a year now in my hand. I am stating my opinion in factual way of the quality and workmanship. Hope to help other consumer/buyer who read comments like myself.
5,This product does all I was looking for.  It allows for typing keeps the surface protected while closed connects (and stays connected well) and is very light in weight.  Definitely a good accessory to have for the surface pro 4.
4,Perfect. Bought a knock off one and ended up buying this after. Spend extra its great!
3,The type cover itself is ok. This one had a faulty key on it but the reseller was very quick to respond and offer up the RMA and a refund. Still looking for another one to replace this one.
5,Super  comfortable keyboard. Get tons of compliments on this all the time. Works well and holds up. Had this for a year and no problems at all.
4,No issues there but a bit pricey if you ask me.
5,Works perfect with my Surface Pro 4!  No setup required just attach it to the tablet and start typing.  Turns your tablet into a ultra portable laptop.  Also the grey color looks really nice.
3,Bought this keyboard for surface pro that I ultimately returned. The typing experience on this keyboard is ok takes a while to get used to. The trackpad however was not as responsive as a normal laptop. Returned after 3 days.
5,I use the KB all the time.  This keyboard is convenient and better than many other smaller keyboards.
5,A good type cover. But returned surface not needed.
5,Still starting out with it but thus far it does not drain my laptop battery and the typing is so smooth and effortless!
5,I love my surface and I love the Pro 4 keyboard. The keys are spaced well the keyboard is back lit. It's a very comfortable keyboard to use. I can't think of a single complaint. :-)
4,I have mostly used pc in docked mode but makes it very portable.
5,I absolutely love this keyboard!  One thing to note is that it took some time to get used to having to turn on the FN key use the F keys at the top of the keyboard.
5,These keyboards are excellent.  They are light the texture is truly great and they are flexible.  Also taking it on and off the device is a fast and easy process and not at all as annoying as I expected it to be.
5,Love this type cover! Better than the previous models. I waited to write this review as I wanted to make sure it worked well looked and felt great it hit top marks in my book!
3,The keyboard works fine but the symbols on it are different. I think I received the UK version or something. It works like a normal keyboard but i have to remember where they are. I threw out the box so I guess I'm stuck with it.
5,Wish they'd bundle this with the Pro4 but still worth the money in my opinion. Great quality and typing on this feels as good as any of my desktop keyboards and better than a lot of my laptop keyboards I've used over the years.
5,Love the keys on this cover. Super easy to use and feel great to type with. The touchpad is very responsive and works great. The Windows 10 "gestures" work really good with the touchpad.
3,This keyboard is very attractive. A bit expensive for what you get given alternatives. The one downside is it is VERY loud. I am not sure why they would make it so clacky its very annoying. Knowing that I wouldn't buy it again.
5,A substantial upgrade over the previous editions of Type Cover this made my Surface Pro 3 far more usable as a proper laptop. Highly recommend the upgrade if you're still using the older edition particularly if you can catch it on sale!
4,My wife loves it. The learning curve is steep and it's more machine than we will ever need.
5,Takes a little bit of getting use to since it is a compact keyboard. Quality seems to be there and functions perfectly. I just have fat fingers and have to be careful. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.
5,the product was very good and met expectation
5,I bought this for my Surface Pro 3 because the previous generation Type Cover was lacking a bit. This one is a hundred times better. It is firm and not wobbly. It feel really good to type with and the mouse pad is MUCH easier to use.
3,It seems to lag and miss typed characters on occasion but I'm not sure if it is the Surface Pro 4 the magnetic connection or the keyboard.  It is a nice thin keyboard but it is obviously not as stable as a regular laptop.
5,Ordered along with Snugg cover - only keyboard that we found integrates with  Surface - it detects when cover is closed (goes into sleep mode) or when keyboard is folded back (goes into tablet mode) - all without touching screen.
4,Great lightweight keyboard. Works well with the surface pro. Love the color!
5,Surface pro 4 type cover is beautiful great key travel and new spacing is much better than predecessor. The new surface pro 2017 edition is really not worth the extra $60.
5,I don't know if they stop making these but you can't find them at Best Buy anymore.
5,The key layout feels as comfortable as a regular keyboard. While keyboards take a while to get used to this was an exception. The touchpad surface also feels awesome: it doesn't have the plasticy and sticky feel that most laptop touchpads I've experienced have.
5,Fit great to the pro 3 surface
5,Quite an improvement over the Surface pro 3 type cover. The larger track pad alone makes an upgrade worth it. The track pad feels smoother and the key strokes are a little better. I'm quite happy with the upgrade and it was worth the money.
5,Got a good price works well unlike the knockoffs you'll see and regret buying later.
5,High quality  very good product
5,Works as it should. The keys are easy to find making typing simple.  Does not require any additional syncing to the MS Surface Just attach via magnetic connector and use.  No charging required.
5,I purchased it for my Surface Pro 3. It works wonderful!! It types so much better. Also it has the Fn lock key and volume control keys which are necessary for any keyboard.
5,Had a problem with a ghost mouse that kept clicking on the same spot after I installed the drivers. But that problem has been fixed and it has worked flawlessly. I love it.
5,Works well for my Microsoft Surface 3!
5,Buen producto muy delgado!!! Llegó rápido!!!Algo difícil de sincronizarse supone que solo se conecta y ya!Pero todo excelente!!!
5,Keyboard has a great look and the backlight is helpful when typing at night or in low light conditions (like on a plane). Touch mousepad is larger than I expected. Nice addition to my Surface Pro 4.
4,Good
5,Just as expected.  Use with my Surface Pro.  Have had it for a while and have never had an issue.
3,i hate to leave three stars because its an amazing product that i needed for my surface however the one i received had a small chip missing out of the keyboard and i hate to be meticulous but for 130 dollars i think it should be flawless.
2,I do not know if it was this type cover or not but shortly after hooking it up to my surface my surface stopped working correctly.  I took it off and after a short time my surface began to work correctly again.  There does not appear to be anything wrong with it but I have not put it back on my surface and just never got around to returning it.
5,Bought this to attach to my Surface Pro 3 and love it! So much better tactile feed back than the previous keyboard. I feel like I can almost touch type like a normal person again!
5,Unfortunately Microsoft doesn't include the cover but after having it's really just not the same experience without it. Great cover fits and works perfectly on the 2017 Surface Pro.
4,This item is fantastic however it came with a slight defect. Thank you.
5,This type cover ads a high quality feel to my surface pro 4 that the other ones don't convey. I do wish that with the higher price point it came with the fingerprint scanner. Maybe next gen.
5,No issues at all. Saved a few bucks by not buying the actual version they sell at MS stores. Lady that works there suggested this one instead.
5,This is such an improvement to the previous keyboard. Yes it works fine with a Surface Pro 3. It writes like a normal laptop keyboard- gone are the days of hand cramps while writing!
5,This key board has a great feel and is backlit which makes it wonderful for use while in dark or dimly lit places. Also it will not slide off of your lap with its suade like texture.
5,Very nice type cover. I have no problem typing with speed on it. Love how easy it is to attached to the surface pro 4. I am glad I decided to buy it.
4,Good. I liked it.
5,Great product! My son loves it. It hooks into the surface easily and responds well. Love the added feature that it folds in to protect the screen.
5,Huge upgrade over the Sufrace 3 keyboard.  Love the "Alcantara" feel of the case.  This will work for both surface 3 and 4.
3,This type cover is useful but soft material was a terrible choice for a tablet cover/keyboard. It gets dirty so easily and I'm hesitent to try any serious cleaning methods because of the electronics inside.
4,Works great.. will wear a but where you put your wrists but wouldn't return it for that!
4,Nice keyboard. Too bad it doesn't have a num lock for a second set of numbers. Too small I guess.
4,Perfect fit to my SurfacePro 3 tablet. Looks nice. Feels nice. Regular sized keyboard.
5,I really like this keyboard.  The keys are raised and there is space between them.  When they are touched the keyboard lights up so it's easy to see the keys in a dark room.
5,A vast improvement over the previous keyboard sturdy track pad is a lot less glitchy and usable typing is very close to an actual laptop keyboard with out adding bulk... If you have a surface 3 this is a must get.
5,Very comfortable product.  I can not go back to any other keyboard.
5,Works great and if you are a touch typer like me and need to "feel" the keys to accurately type this is an essential.  So far so good and quality seems top notch.
5,surface keyboard.  Works as expected
5,This keyboard is a huge upgrade from the original version that came with the Pro 3.  Highly recommend replacing old one with this one (any color of course).  I like the teal makes it unique without being too extreme.
5,I got my reviews mixed up this is the keyboard and I love it it lights up as you type too... I also got the leather cover that fits perfectly even have a red mouse
5,I've only had product for a week but so far so good.
4,Sleek light lights functioning.  I can dig it.
5,Used with our Surface Pro 3 and it's far superior than the old Pro 3 keyboard.  The keys feel more like true laptop keys and they do not get stuck as often as the Pro 3.  Great buy!
5,Great replacement key board.
5,Best keyboard ever to date. I would like to see microsoft include the keyboard when purchasing a very expensive laptop. That doesnt take away from the excellent lightweight construction of the keyboard. Attachment to the surface pro is easy and quick.
5,Hooked right up to the surface pro and started typing with no issues. Have been using it for several months now and have not had any problems with it.
4,Unable to get purple or pink color cover. Since this was for my wife's Pro 4 it was a little disappointment to her.
5,The keyboard feel the backlighting and the trackpad are all superb and I'm super picky about keyboards and trackpads. This is a MUST HAVE for any Surface Pro 3 or 4 owner.
5,No problems with it yet I’ve had it a few months now
5,Looks good and feels great recommended and a must have for your Surface Pro 6.
4,works good
4,Work fine like it.
5,Absolutely worth it if you have surface pro 3 or 4. I instantly loved the feel of typing on my surface pro 3. It is worth the money to upgrade the surface pro 3 keyboard.
5,I didn't realize that it would be clothy feeling but I actually kind of like it. Works awesomely and it works with my Surface RT (I'm still waiting for my Surface Pro 4 to be delivered).
1,I would not recommend purchasing this keyboard again.  First of all they sent me the wrong size keyboard for my first generation Surface Pro.  Even though the keyboard does work with my devise the keys stick leaving a streak of a letter across my message.  It does not matter which key is pressed it will randomly stick.  Recently I type a lengthy message to someone I pressed the delete button to correct a spelling error it deleted 3/4 of the message.You might have better luck than I but I would not recommend purchasing a a keyboard from this supplier.
5,Snapped right in and worked immediately. Perfect. I wish there were more color choices but the real is beautiful so I can't complain.
4,It's a plastic cover and keyboard.  It works.  It meets expectations.
5,Quality and durable.  Works great.
5,I bought this for my son and he loves it. Excellent product
4,I see this getting really dirty but otherwise works great
5,Looks good and works fine.The blue is really lovely and eye catching.I ordered this because the one with the fingerprint ID I ordered from another seller on Amazon stopped working after two days.
5,Fab. Key pad is lightweight but not flimsy and super easy to touch type with. Responsive and fast. The color is gorgeous. Beats the hell out of the iPad keypad/cover which has broken twice.
5,Works great and is a lot nicer than the one I had for my Surface RT. It is great quality and the keys are nicely spaced. I haven't had any problems with it.
5,This was a Christmas present for my wife.  She absolutely loves this key board.
5,Good for me
5,Great! Fits with the Surface Pro 3 and makes it feel more like a Surface Pro 4! Well worth a little more to buy this one over the 3's keyboard.
4,No compaints so far.  Have had for about one month.
5,Received Type cover for SP4 on time. Brand new in factory packaging from ShopSmart Deals. Works as expected with my SP4. Like the backlit keys. Keys are spaced well.
5,looks amazing had to change my glasses to match the keyboard
4,Haven used yet but sure looks nice great price and fas shipping thank you
4,I am very pleased with the keyboard/cover although it would be nice to have a numeric keypad on it as well.
4,Much better typing experience than the Surface Pro 3 cover.  Almost as good as a regular sized keyboard.
4,The pad sometimes gets crazy but ilumination and big keys are amazing
5,First day of use and I can say it is the best keyboard I tried ever. The quality of the material is great. I just love it.
2,HiHow can I get it replaced? Keyboard stopped working with in four months keys like enter and couple of other keys do not respond. My original keyboard still works fines it is more than 2 years old due to wear tear of the outer skin I wanted a new one. To my surprise this  one lasted only four months.  How can I get it replaced under warranty.
4,Back lit and works but be careful dragging your thumbs across the pad wihile typing or your tyoing may jump sentensces
4,Type cover is nice. I just wish it didn't get dirty so quickly
5,Very comfortable to type on; I really enjoy the spaced keys vs the older keyboards. Variable back-light feature is really cool. As my sister said when looking at it from a side-angle: "It feels like I'm looking into the future..."
4,We bought it refurbished and it's a little squeaky. Overall a great keyboard/cover. Don't bother with the touch cover.
5,Keyboard and mouse  work perfectly  and provide great screen protection. Goes perfect with my Brenthaven BX2 Edge case. I'm really happy great looking combo
2,The rubber top started wearing off and becoming stretchy
4,A big improvement in comparison to the surface pro 3 type cover the keys are much better and not mushy.
5,Works well for a surface 4. I have had the product for a couple months with no issues. The faux suede does pick up some stains tho.
5,Wonderful product.  Good tactile feedback crisp key action flexible connection to "tablet" portion of surface pro good protection for screen.  Would buy again.
5,This keyboard is actually better than the standard one: it is less flimsy and seems less like a piece of camping equipment.  The trackpad surface seems a bit nicer.
3,Is a good price. But the one that showed up was not like the picture; it was a French Canadian keyboard. Took a little to get used to but the extra keys come in handy sometime.
5,It works perfectly.  The pad is so nice.  Seems super smooth and responsive.  Back lighting works great.  I have my SP4 in a rugged was and this works great with it.
3,Decent enough keyboard but after five months of very minor use the spacebar has started squeaking. Really obnoxious. There's no obvious way to remove keys so I guess I'm stuck with a bird chirping away in my keyboard.
5,Talk about style for your Surface Pro!  Along with the Marimekko Poppy Case Decals my PC now totally reflects my personality.
5,It is super useful and a "must-have" accessory for SURFACE.
4,Works as expected. Like the back lit keyboard feature. Makes it easy to work in dim light.
4,Good quality. Like new. Works well.
5,Looks excellent durability is a time issue have not had long enough to rate that
5,Lovely color for this keyboard. the function and performance is great. light and thin but easy to keep the fingerprints on caps. the lighting function is fantasitic. I like it very much.
5,Love this and the color
4,This cover has a backlightThis cover is great for smooth typing
4,Good keyboard but magnets mess up at times.
5,Absolutely great.  I love the color.  Works great and feels very nice.  Very good quality and price
5,Works well and connects well. Very light and portable. I love it! Haven't had issues with it in the last 2 months I've been using it.
5,The keys are remarkable really soft and nice to the touch and by contrast with the cover smooth but rich. The touchpad is very Macish and well done.
5,Arrived as described in new condition. Essential for full use of SP4. Works right out of the box. Connect to surface and start typing right away. Like the light blue color. Would recommend.
5,Had to return it since no longer needed my  Surface pro 4 had some wifi issues but type cover works great! Very comfortable not sure about the price though....
5,Keyboard seems more responsive than the one designed for the Surface Pro 3 and the keys are spread further apart to simulate a full-sized keyboard.
4,I need the ñ letter !!!
4,Good product.
5,Works better than the Surface Pro 3 keyboard.  I replaced my still working Surface Pro 3 keyboard with this one and am happier with it.  The build quality is great and I love the blue color!
5,Works better than expected feels and operates like you'd expect. Must buy if you're looking to carry in a case.
4,Great on Surface Pro 4 material is cool looks great
5,I like this keyboard which detaches from my Pro 4. I find it easier to type on than the Surface Book I bought. It works well with fat fingers!
5,This was "refurbished" and seem to be performing as one might expect with a new keyboard.
5,Well Engineered.  Keys feel great.  It is powered through the magnetic connection and does not need a separate charger like a Bluetooth keyboard.
3,A great keyboard but doesn't last too long.  Just after a year the covering is beginning to wear off and I've had to use tape to keep it all together.
5,It's a keyboard... what more can one really say?  Works as advertised.
4,good product bad for the price
4,Good
4,The track pad's reaction needs to be betteR other than that the keyboard is really good
5,Good keyboard
5,The touch pad is the biggest improvement. Much easier to use because if it's bigger size and better layout. The keyboard had been improved as well and is much more comfortable to use.
5,The Surface Pro 3 Keyboard was pretty good but this one feels so much more stable and higher quality than my pro 3 type cover.  I also love that it's compatible with and fits my Surface Pro 3.
5,The keyboard is great type on and fit perfectly with the surface. Super easy to Install.
5,Works great looks good and very functional.  I do a lot of typing and have minimal difficulty using this keyboard.  Keyboard is quiet for taking notes during meetings.
5,Beautiful keyboard for my Surface Pro. Very good typing experience.
1,I should have known not to get a refurbished anything….this keyboard was terrible. Several keys don’t work it was filthy upon opening…and some keys just stayed “pressed” the mouse pad was also terrible. Super annoying. Again Do. Not. purchase. Just get the new one.
5,Great for the price will recommend for anyone needing a typecover.
5,The keys feel very nice and solid. They're easy to type on especially since the keys are spaced out. The touchpad feels high quality. The magnets attach to the Surface with ease.
4,There is always room for improvement but pretty solid yo
5,Love love love this keyboard. I purchased red and it is the perfect shade. The keys are soft and the touchpad is amazing. No problems so far.
5,Looooooove
4,Can get dammaged easily though :-(
4,Item as described. Good Product...
4,love it very much
5,I really love this keyboard for the most part. It takes some time to get used to how the keys are but all in all a good product.
5,I love how compact it is. Super easy to use and it goes everywhere.
1,We're a local government organization.  We bought 3 of these keyboards for our Surface Pros that are used in meeting 2x per month and they are kept in the office at all times; these keyboard have been used less than a handful of times and several keys stopped working on 2 of them...  We were able to return one just a week or so after purchasing it however the window passed to return the other so taxpayers should know that they paid $90 for a keyboard that is now useless. Trying to contact the manufacturer is like trying to communicate to the dead.  Don't waste your money.
5,Love this keyboard but does not let you right click is the only problem and sometimes the mouse freezes so you have to unblock the keyboard and put it back on again
5,this is a great keyboard. I was a little worried about the mouse pad being on the board had issues with these in the past. Keys are spaced well highly functional!
5,Snaps right on has it's own stand.  The keys feel almost like a regular keyboard.  Also protects the Surface Pro when not in use.
4,It looks good and works well so far.
5,This arrived on time and works great! I'm very pleased with the feel and ease of use. Touch pad is great and illuminated keys are a bonus. I would highly recommend.
1,This is my second identical keyboard. The first did not last a year. It stopped working abruptly.  In this second one my letter 'J key is not working as well as the 'DEL" delete key. I am very disappointed with this keyboard. It cost too much for a short life span. I will not be buying this keyboard again.
5,Much improved product over the Surface Pro 3 type cover.  This keyboard has changed my opinion of the Surface for the better!  It works flawlessly with my Surface Pro 3!
4,It was what was requested by users.
5,I'm really happy with my new keyboard. It was well packaged and I like how the keys sit compared to the Surface Pro 3 version.
5,solid keyboard Way better to have a hard line connected keyboard than all the blue tooth variance keyboards out there.
4,Very good
4,sometimes has connection problems
5,This keyboard is so much better than the pro 3 one. It is more rigid has a larger smoother more accurate mouse. It is definitely worth upgrading to.
1,I was so excited to have found a teal colored keyboard and immediately purchased this in July 2020.  Just 2-3 months later it started to not respond to the connection of the tablet and would take anywhre from 6-90 minutes to connect.  So frsutareded bc i cant really find a teal keyboard anywhere.  I loved it until the issues started less than 6 months after purchase.  Won't be buying again!!
5,Works perfect with my Surface Pro 3 giving better tactile feel than the original model offered with the SP3.
5,Excellent design. Excellent product. Wondered about ordering the fingerprint scanner version but glad I did not spend the extra money because the Surface Pro 4 facial recognition is excellent (even when wearing eye glasses).
5,This makes my Surface a computer.  Yet it is so thin and easy to take with me when I travel!  It is so easy to use!
5,I love it! The glass track pad could use some work it is too loud and not accurate enough...But that's on MS end and not you vendors.
4,Slightly awkward as a cover but great as a keyboard. Very practical to use with surface Pro series!
5,This is one of the most comfortable keyboards I got to use. Feels premium and looks nice. Love it.
5,Really couldn't ask for a better keyboard attachment. It folds up nicely against the tablet and fits easily inside the cover.
1,Yes it does look beautiful and a good cover for your tablet but as a keyboard is useless all signs configurations are wrong if you want a comma you will end up getting a question mark some signs in the keyboard don't even exist and yes I returned it and bought another one just in case the first one was just a manufacturing reject but the second one was as useless as the first one and got exactly the same issue. Makes me think why some costumer reviews gave it a 5 star If the keyboard is useless other than just to use it as a cover I just tell you this a real costumer wont give a useless keyboard 5 stars.
5,Pay the extra money up front and get this keyboard for your Surface Pro.  Just do it.  It's worth it for the quality.
5,I really disliked the SP3 keyboard and just received the SP4 keyboard for my SP3.  I love it!  I'm making far fewer typing mistakes on this keyboard compared to my SP3 keyboard.
4,It works and looks good but it came with one key damaged.
2,I bought the light blue color Type Cover and my eyes get tired with it. No blame to Microsoft here that's just me. Since I had to drive to Microsoft Store because my brand new Surface did not work I bought a new cover a darker model. It happens that the new one has a very insensitive mouse pad unreliable. Very often I have to click twice or three times. It would be good if it worked. What is the problem with Microsoft?
5,It works great. I do like the fact that it stays attached reall well. It does afftect the battery time of the Surface Pro 4 alittle but not to bad.
5,As usual - high quality product.Gorgeous touchpad.Great keyboard with backlit.
5,Beautifully made works perfectly with my old SP3 - given it a new lease on life! Recommended.
5,1
3,This Surface keyboard as I anticipate all other Surface keyboards is just okay. The mouse functionality is a bit quirky as it's often very difficult to select a chunk of text.
5,Premium feeling and really responsive keys. The material is really good and i would think it gets dirty quick but it does not.
5,At the price point perfect for my Sp6..
5,Great value
5,Type cover works very well. Comfortable to use.
5,Love having this to go with my Surface so that when I need it to be more like a laptop it is.  Most of all I love the color!!!
4,Works well with my Microsoft Surface 4 tablet.
5,Great experience product was like new.
5,I've been using this keyboard for a few weeks now with no issues.  I love it and the fact that it was cheaper here than the Microsoft store.
5,works like a dream i saw other reviews with off brand keyboards having lag and this type cover does not in any way. nice and responsive.
5,Exceeded expectations. Hard to believe that a flip cover has keys with this much travel. Easy to snap on and type on.
4,Loved the cover quality is really good. Happy to use this product
5,Great keyboard. My last one broke after 3 years so be careful they are not indestructible.
5,Besides the fact that you have to pay for the keyboard everything about it is great. Its smooth stylish comfortable and responsive. I could not be happier with this leyboard
4,Staff are satisfied with this product.
5,These are all Christmas gifts so it was a collection of wanted items for the Surface
5,I like this keyboard much better than the original for the Surfacxe Pro 3. The keys are further apart which is good for my thick fingers. Works great. A must have for the Surface device.
5,This is so easy to use and I love the textures. Also I read above that someone said the keys did not light up....my keys sure do!
5,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Case - ProCase Premium Folio Cover Case for Surface Pro 4 (12.3") Compatible with Surface Pro 4 Type Cover Keyboard Built-in
5,iam so happy that I got this keyboard  it's just great and it's like new one
4,Works great
5,This keyboard is perfect. Easy to type on and makes the Surface Pro 4 so much easier to use. I highly recommend.
3,The suface sometimes will not recognize that it is plugged in and sometimes will randomly disconnect it. It is not often but it is an issue hence the two stars taken off.
5,Great quality keyboard and cover. Easy to use with a great finish. Highly recommended.Works with Surface Pro 3 & 4
4,Works as expected.
2,After eight month of purchase the surface keyboard just stops responding periodically. Even when I am typing the keyboard would just stop recognising my inputs abruptly.I have exhuasted multiple methods to resolve this issue including restarting cleaning the keyboard resintalling the driver. These methods works at first but just last for days before the keyboard is shut down again.It has been very irritating!
5,Love the color.. wish it had with fingerprint sensor as well
5,excellent typecover. this is much better than the pro 3 typecover. the keys are spaced better the response is better and the trackpad is night and day. it is also much more stable and stronger.
2,I bought a Red keyboard to go with my windows tablet. The Red covering is peeling off with little use to the keyboard. Bought in april of 2020
4,Good color low key ideal for corporate environment
2,This worked really well for the first two months that I had it but now it rarely connects with the tablet and when it does the mouse pad either drags tabs anywhere it pleases or doesn't register a click unless you slam your finger down as hard as possible. I had gone with this one because it was more aesthetically pleasing and now have to buy a regular keyboard anyway. Disappointing.
5,Use on Surface Pro 4 works like a champ.
5,LOVEEE LOVE LOVEEEE this keyboard! It was everything I expected it to be!  The black keyboard is standard but its beautiful!  I recommend!
5,Great quality! The type cover looks absolutely gorgeous and is sturdy. This on was a it more spendier but definitely worth it for the quality!
4,Works as expected
4,Great price for a great product!
5,as described
4,Good price
4,I love how easy it is to type.
5,surface pro 4 type cover working excellently on surface pro 3. love it worth the spend.
5,👍🏼
5,It's a must for a surface. Kinda dumb they sell the surface w/o it. Feel just like a laptop keyboard as far as quality goes.
5,Great pricing on this cover. Just snap it in and it goes to work. Can't be any more simple to use.
5,Like the new key design for the type cover to use with my surface 4.  May replace the type cover on my surface 3 with this also.
5,the red is so beautiful loving it it's my schools color so I'm going to look pretty fresh carrying it around lol
5,Excellent design and perfect functionality. Makes its work as a regular keyboard. It seems to be a little bit fragile due to its reduced thickness.
5,its a really good product. I don't go anywhere without it. its functional sleek and great when I don't have to borrow computer for work purposes.
5,Quick delivery and just as pretty of a color as I had thought! Works just as described and was just what I needed
5,Just what we needed. Great quality.
5,Absolutely loved these. They are a good weight seem durable color is awesome. I will definitely be getting them in every color! I just love the fit and feel.
5,No complaints.  I use a full size when docked but when I grab and go on the road and travel this keyboard works great.
4,A little heavy but it's a good bit of padded protection for the Pro4.
5,I love the color fits perfect
5,I like the key's makes it feel like a full laptop but can bend some on the lap. still love it!
5,This one is great product and works as expected. Very good value from Amazon.com and don't know how they did it.
5,great keyboard. At least it looks great. CANT USE IT BC MY TABLET CAME DEAD ON ARRIVAL. thanks amazon. But great paper weight!
5,Excellent upgrade to my SP3. The keys are much nicer and it feels almost like a real keyboard. Highly recommend if your cover has sticky keys or just needs a refresh.
5,This keyboard attaches very easy.  It connects to the Surface easily and operates very well.  The keyboard feels just as good if not better than a regular laptop keyboard.
4,Great Product I like it
5,this keyboard is phenomenal. A vast improvement on the tight keyboard of past surface computers
5,This is way better than the surface pro 3 cover.  Hope they get cheaper.  But if you have a surface pro 3 or surface pro 4 this is a must.
5,Works perfectly with my Surface Pro 3.  Comfortable to type with like a laptop keyboard and the back lighting is great for nighttime use.
3,I have issues occasionally where the keyboard isn't recognized and I have to detach and reattach for the thing to work. Sometimes I have to restart the machine. Overall not the best experience.
5,my only concern before buying the cover was how stiff is it for typing. after using for a week i can say it's perfect in every way and the color is really nice
4,Very nice tool light weight comfortable in typing.The touchpad is very easy.
5,I used this with my Surface Pro 3 and it works an absolute treat.
4,Nice keyboard useful and easy to install.
4,Great product
2,Build quality is really disappointing. First one had the touchpad right click stop working and the new one has lopsided function keys. The rest of the keys are weird in the sense that some of them don't depress evenly. Kind of disappointed and if the type cover 3 wasn't so bad I would have stuck with that. Also the touchpad is not even either but at least the right click works
5,Excellent keyboard! Feels great looks nice. I got the teal type cover. The trackpad is very responsive and feels great. Good investment.
4,A little bit hard to type.
5,Works with SurfacePro 3 and feels better to the touch than the 3 keyboard. Best Buy said the 4 keyboard wouldn't work with SP3-don't know what they're doing at that place!
5,Don't buy the cheap Asian keyboards they don't compare to this!  Spend the money you'll be so much happier.
5,I love the keyboard.  I'm still a bit of a lap top person and prefer it to the screen keyboard.
5,I got this keyboard to go with my tablet.  it works well. I had no issues with it and I would recommend this to anyone!
4,Love it. Works excellently.
3,Great touch pad and key responsiveness but when moving the Surface Pro it has a "floppy" kind of feel to it.
5,Met my expectations of color and size! I'm giving as a gift for Christmas so I'm unable to say how it actually types & connects!
5,Great product.  It makes typing on the Surface much easier and protects the screen.  I like some of the other colors but black seems the most professional.
5,Works like its supposed to. This is a must have for you Surface users!
5,Ditch the pro 3 keyboard and get the 4. This one is better than the other pro 4 keyboards as well. Feels good
5,New Surface Pro 4 type cover works on Surface Pro 3 and has a much more natural and spaced-out keyboard that makes typing on the Surface Pro 3 very easy.
5,Don't settle for anything less than Microsoft products with your new surface. its perfect and light weight and fits this cool case i got for it.
3,Loved the keyboard thought for $100 it should have lasted longer than 20 months.
4,Keyboard is larger easier to use because the keys are slightly separated.
4,Do not appear cleanable suede like material
5,Excellent keyboard. I'm super picky about my keyboards as I write a lot. I can write on this keyboard all day long if needed.
4,This a must have accessory for the Surface Pro 4!
5,Love how it looks protects the front of the tablet screen and its so easy to take on and off with the magnet help when plugging it back onto the tablet
5,Nice Cover/Keyboard for Surface Pro4 feel solid yet not heavy gives the Surface Pro4 a notebook feel. A  must have if you don't like typing with virtual keyboard on tablet.
5,Fit surface pro perfectly. Easy set up.
5,First one I ordered had some dead keys but #2 works flawlessly and is a great addition to my Surface Pro 3.
5,This keyboard is so much better than the one I had on my old surface. The price was good compared to prices in stores!
5,Perfect marriage with my new Surface Pro 4!! Works great. Wonderful feel to keys with feedback to fingers. Really easy connect and disconnect. Really glad I got it.
5,Just received and I love this keyboard!  Types nicely and (to me) it's like a smaller skinner keyboard!
5,Type cover is very nice.  All keys are very responsive and the backlighted keys are also very helpful in low light areas.Excellent!!
5,Good quality just like new. No any flaw. It works well! All the functions have been tested no problem.It is worth the money.
3,Keyboard is great but it collects dust better than a swiffer. Swiffer should find out what the coating is on the keyboard and start using it.
4,Responsive ideal for the Surface Pro 4
5,This is great; it also has the back lit keys mouse touch is very nice as well. System is fast
4,Good companion for Surface Pro
5,A Good looking product. Very neutral product which goes well with the Surface Pro 4
5,Would definitely recommend this for the MS surface Pro 4. Very well built and small. Delivered before schedule too.
5,perfect used with Surface Pro 4 & https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019TTJHCO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1fit form finish and function of the three together is very nice.
5,G r e a t purchase and g r e a t productMicrosoft products is really powerful performanceThanks
5,Perfect for my Microsoft Surface Pro 4! Fits the surface keyboard and pen perfectly! I receive compliments on the color and style constantly! Must buy!
5,typing a this review on it and love the feel of it.  the only con would be that it should be included with the pro 4 for the price..
4,good product works well
5,The type cover totally changes the user experience with the SP4. I love it. It's so much better than previous type covers.
5,Only gripe is that there are no hardware buttons for left right and maybe middle click.
1,Stopped working after a few months. Too late to return. Forgot to leave a review. Only now remembered because I'm looking for a replacement preferably from a different company.
5,works great  good feel to the keys  protects the screen and I love it
5,Works perfectly and looks good and cheaper to buy on Amazon than in the stores in Canada. I would recommend.
4,works like  champ
1,I received one of these with a purchase of a Surface in July. The mouse touchpad didn't work correctly; the cursor jumped all over the place and didn't track my finger. Amazon replaced the type cover with a new one. It worked. I was so please. 6 months later and the mouse touchpad is doing the same thing the old one was.Explain to me exactly why these things are so poorly made when they are an essential part of owning a Surface.
5,Looks and feels good - works well with the protection I have placed on the surface pro 3 fine fine
5,amazing great quality feels good on my fingers and matches my surface so thats always a plus.
4,very happy with the product...thanks
5,Matches my red UAG cover perfect!  Keyboard is well laid out and I love the backlighting behind the keys.  Nice touch!
5,Way better than the previous Type covers. Typing is great and the touchpad really feels premium.My only regret is that i should have bought one with the fingerprint reader.
5,The only problem I have with this is that I did not know that there was one with a fingerprint scanner when I purchased it!!
5,It’s wonderful and works perfectly
5,It is really much better then my previous type cover 3 with my surface pro 3. I strongly recommend it as very nice upgrade for surface. pro 3.
5,Fits my Surface 3 Pro. Nicer Color too.Keyboard is far better and key presses are far improved over the old model.. Also the Mouse pad is more responsive and bigger.
5,Perfect
5,It's expensive but worth it as I have found no worthy alternatives nor do I want something that thin thats been used by others.
3,It was excellent at first. I have had it for about six months now and the touch pad doesn't always work.
5,Got this for my husband. He's very happy with it. He uses his Micosoft Surface Pro for work and at home. The red is a nice color.
5,That stuff is very good and cheap compared to the official MS store. Have no problems with this as it should be.
5,Works perfect and is a genuine product at a cheaper price. Great find glad I found this online at Amazon!
5,Turns my surface tablet into a viable notebook.  The magnet to hold the keyboard in place is very strong and works great.
3,The computer should come with a keyboard - for the price you pay for the Surface you shouldn't have to buy another component that is key for operation.
5,This is a perfect addition to my Surface pro 4. Much easier to get things done. Covers the screen while travelling and having backlit keys is a plus.
5,On my 2nd Surface because the first one was so great. This keyboard cover is a must have for my work and I recommend it!
4,good item
5,Very happy with the product.
5,works well.  I've had this cover for a few weeks now and use it for work. I haven't had any problems with itl
5,The quality of the new type cover is great. Just like using a rigid keyboard in a laptop.
5,Love the color and the wonderful feeling of typing on it. Perfecgt key resistance and "silky"  key surface.
5,Using it to write this review. This is required to do any extensive typing on the SP4. Very smooth keys and easy to use.
5,Works great
4,Good design. Easy to use
5,After a month of use I dropped a cup of coffee on it and it survived.
5,The type cover is great I am a fast typer and the space between all keys is great the backlit a great plus.
5,Works great! I purchased this used and received their was not even a scratch on it. Paired and worked right out of the box.
5,Using this on my Surface Pro 3 and love it!  I just wish the red one wasn't much more expensive at the time.
5,Good but to use in Brazil is diferent
4,love it
5,Great product! tried three cheaper key boards guess you do get what you pay for!
5,Its awesome. If you are buying surface pro no reason you should not buy the keyboard. And its cheaper on amazon too. boom chiki!!
5,I like it so much ❤️
5,Better than not having a keyboard? This should come with the Surface Pro 4. It doesn't. Pick your favorite color and chill out.
5,Great keyboard for surface pro. Lasts well and still going strong.
5,Great for surface pro. Makes it easier to type. Keys are firm and back-lit.
5,Must need if you have a Surface. Have had mine for a year and it is still working flawlessly
5,Excellent.  Delivered when promised. Outstanding product.Works with the Surface 3 but far superior to the Surface 3 type cover
5,I have been using this regular. So far everything is working fine. I like the backlit keyboard.
5,great addition to my Surface Pro....the onscreen keyboard is difficult to use when I need to do a lot of typing.
5,Good feel and a must have for your Surface Pro.  Looks & wears like no other cover.
5,Find it as expected
5,Love this super quality love the backlit keys im a busy mom so do most of my 'work' (checking of email and shopping) at night this is great.
5,The keyboard feels sturdier than I had anticipated. I love the color and overall feel of it. Would highly recommend.
5,Microsoft Type Cover for Surface Pro  - Black        Works as expected.
5,Great addition for the Surface 4 Pro.  Much easier to use than the electronic screen keyboard.
5,Very satisfied.  This was my first Surface purchase and the cover has worked well for me.
5,I really love this keyboard.  It works very well.  The touch is good and it has the best touch pad I have used.
5,Good texture. It is a cover but good keyboard. Ease of use is same level of laptop PC but much lighter and thinner.
5,Great lightweight keyboard
5,Great keyboard responsive and quiet. looks great too love the felt feeling when its closed. seems like high quality and should last a long time.
5,magnetic works great fits well over my tempered glass.  Lights up nicely in the dark.  worth every penny.
5,Got it for our new CEO and he's very happy with it. If need arises again I'd be happy to purchase again.
2,keyboard stopped working within three weeks. i tried doing the software resets with the surface but they no longer correct the issue. good concept longevity of the product is a serious issue.  of course life got in the way and i missed the return window so now i'm out the cost of the keyboard.
1,Item did not cover the tablet.  Picture of the item looks like my other surface pro keyboard (I have two) and both surface pro tablets are the same diagonal.  But this keyboard is smaller keys are closer together than the picture and the touch pad is much smaller than the one in the picture.  Hope is was just a wrong unit shipped but worried a bunch were maybe made to a different spec?
5,My surface pro 4 is now complete. Works well. Backlit keyboard is nice.
3,I find the the touch pad dosen't always respond to my touches properly which can be frustrating. Planning to use an external mouse.
5,Great keyboard travel and has been durable. I have had it for about a year and it still looks great.
4,Works well
5,I really like this keyboard (I love the color too). It's light-weight easy to type on and the keyboard lights up!!
5,Exactly what I ordered. No surprises and I'm a guy that doesn't like surprises when ordering online.
2,Love the look and feel. But my cursor keeps disappearing in middle of use and only way to maybe get it to return is to shut down. Very annoying and can’t seem to find any fixes.
4,Okay but I have seen better.
5,A great add to my #Seahawk themed Surface Pro 4.  I like the newer key style over the version 3 keyboard too. #GoHawks
5,A lot of improvement from the surface pro 3 keyboard. It fits my surface pro 3
1,This is my second keyboard cover (for a 2 year old surface pro 3) and after a month or so of use it only works intermittently already. I don't know if it's the surface unit or the keyboard (I tried cleaning contacts etc etc) but as we all know the surface is almost useless without the keyboard and this keyboard can't be relied on to work when I need it to...so the overall experience has been horrible. This is another crash and burn experience for MS Hardware - when will I learn??Don't keep wasting money on Microsoft hardware like I have!
5,Fast shipping arrived before Christmas!Very please with this type cover awesome!
5,Was rather reserved before the purchase yet the keyboard is great. Keys accurate backlight elegant and fantastic touchpad precise.
5,Love it! Feels like a regular laptop of desktop keyboard. I got it for my pro 3 which makes me super happy. Works fine connects easily.
5,Very good
5,Hey I’m in excellent condition works great thank you👍
2,I bought this a year ago and the keyboard now comes apart when I remove it from the screen.  It still works fine but I have to put it together every time I want to remove it.  If Microsoft could fix this this product would be nearly perfect
5,Don’t buy a surface pro without it.
5,It's a great keyboard. Don't pay for one at the store when you can save money here!
5,Great keyboard!Strong magnets to connect keyboard to surface tablet. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a Surface Pro 4 keyboard.
5,Hard to find this color at most retailers and I was able to save $20 ordering on Amazon. I could not be happier!
4,Using it everyday great product
5,Easy to use install and stylish too! Can't go wrong when the price is better competitively than all the competition.
1,This type cover  have lots of issues; it's a shame that such a good ideas and design brings these amount of issues shown in several forums including Microsoft own forum. This keyboard will stop working or every time to time some of the keys will stop working and you'll need to search an angle to bring those keys back to normal (maybe) the unit it self waoo! great tool but you Microsoft need to stop giving excuses and bring a out a firmware to fix this tons of complains soon
5,Works great
5,Keyboard works great
2,When it works it's great! On the other hand less than 6 months of use and my SP4 only recognizes the keyboard about half the time. Really frustrating. I don't know if the problem is with the keyboard or the tablet - neither would surprise me. I guess for the price I expected a better product.
5,I've been using this for over a year and it still works!
5,Great present for Grandson's birthday.  He really wanted this.
5,I love this keyboard!!
5,This type cover is ideal for typing up term-papers reports or anything else you desire. It's actually much smoother than an actual keyboard.
1,See title.
1,It worked fine for a couple weeks. Then I started to notice more typos than usual. I would start typing in one spot and it would jump to another place in the text and start typing.  It gets worse each day. I tried to save some money and will now have to pay twice because this device is defective. You get what you pay for....  I will be the next one directly from Microsoft.
5,Bought it for my SP 3 - big improvement over the SP 3 type cover. Can actually use this one as my main keyboard.
5,I have two previous keyboards and this one is definitely an improvement.  Keys are easier to use great backlighting very stable touchpad.  Love it
5,Love how it sticks to bottom of Microsoft Surface Pro 4!
5,Love! I was a little worried it would show dirt but so far so good.
4,A little soft
5,I have the Pro 3 and this type cover is a game changer. No longer need an external mouse and typing is a breeze.
5,Works great looks brand new it seems to have slight trouble connecting rarely. Aside from that it's amazing.
4,Everything is great but some connectivity problems.
5,As expected
1,I bought this with my Surface Pro in 2016.  Three days after my warranty expired my Surface died and Microsoft replaced it.  Just this morning the red type cover broke itself.  It lasted exactly three years and now I need to spend more money to buy another.  Was gentle with it yet still wore itself out.  Perhaps the newer versions are better?  Otherwise just budget for replacement accordingly.
5,The Keyboard arrived in good condition and works great.  Looking forward to it lasting a long time.
5,Quick shipping and the exact product as advertised.
5,It's a great cover and I love the color. It came immediately and it was the one I wanted.
5,Turns a tablet into a laptop.  Perfect fit on my MS Surface Pro 4.  If it could only fix Windows 10.....
5,Works great with my Surface Pro 3.  Keys are nicely spaced and touch pad has been perfect.
5,beautifulthe keyboard lights up and has different light settings.super light weightworks great after several weeks
5,Best keyboard i have ever used you never have the sense that you might miss pressed a key.
5,Mechanical keys big touch pad snap very nicely with the device and classy color(teal).
5,Lights up easy to clean good spacing of keys and I have big hands. Great product.
5,My son loves it feels like he has a new surface pro!
5,Easy to use and similar to a standard keyboard. Heavy duty enough to protect the screen and the mouse pad is very reactive.
4,Works as listed
1,This was great at first but after a few months the touch pad started sticking and now it's so ridiculously annoying to use the touch pad because it kind of just goes crazy and does whatever it wants. Disappointing for the money that was paid for it. Just not sturdy at all. Now I just use my old wireless keyboard which is not ideal or convenient to bring to class or anywhere for that matter. Basically defeats the entire purpose of buying the surface pro to begin with.
5,This was a gift and was very well received
5,Great product and very fast delivery for a good price will use this seller again.
5,Great keyboard positive feel and easy to clean. Color is vibrant and it works on the surface 4 with ease.
5,Fits perfectly with my surface pro 4. Love thay it's back-lit. Great purchase!
5,Love
5,Works very well for me.
5,Very high quality keyboard.  Replaced original surface pro 3 keyboard.  My daughter loves this one!!
5,The color isn't as bright as I was hoping but it works which is all that matters.
3,Item works but shows dirty on keys easily.
5,Works Well
4,works well for me
5,This keyboard is awesome! The material is so nice. Love the improved type cover.
5,Much better than the Surface Pro 3 type cover. Not much else to say about it than that.
4,Perfect keyboard too pricey.
2,Several keys became inoperative after several months about 4 out of warranty had to buy new one.
5,Bought this for my wife.  This is a lifesaver.  IMO a must if you have a Surface Pro.
5,Easy to type on and wonderfully quiet so I don't disturb the wifey in bed or the others in a meeting.
5,Works perfectly came clean in good packaging. I love it!
5,👍👍👍
3,Four keys did not work!
5,Love the keyboard TouchPad is perfect.
5,Great product for the price. The keyboard even lights up while in use to see the keys.
4,All good
5,Original surface keyboard with price cheaper than Microsoft store.Rest the quality of product we all know is top class.
3,Fine
5,Not a problem yet very helpful.
5,Love it. Nice design and good typing.
5,Essential if you own a Surface Pro.  Fantastic quality and always works like a charm.
4,Great keyboard.
5,The keyboard works great and I'm glad that I bought it. I haven't had any problems with it.
5,Great product for the surface and very easy to attach.
5,Exactly what I wanted for my Surface Pro - love the color
5,Works as intended.  Can also be attached in reverse to be used as a grippier back cover in tablet mode.
5,Love it. It lights up in the dark and I never have to worry about charging it.
5,Great product. The color is awesome with a smoky look. Protects and soft to the touch when typing.
5,tablet becomes what a laptop was meant to be - super light portable and protects the tablet screen - excellent idea
4,bad smell.
5,Best keyboard for surface pro 3. Light beautiful comfortable and sexy. Nothing else needed
5,Absolutely perfect
5,Works seamlessly with my pro 3. Easy to install and feels great to type on. Highly recommend.
5,makes it so much easier now with this keyboard to do what I need with my Surface Pro 4; I love it.
5,It feels great to type on it and it's soft and rigid at the same time.
5,Microsoft Type Cover Surface Pro 4 Blue = Great = Sturdy= Comfortable on the finger Tips.
5,I use this keyboard with the surface pro 3 and it is so comfortable and responsive. LOVE IT!
5,Works great
5,This keyboard is fantastic light weight magnetic so it stays on and there are times when you want to use a keyboard
5,Really nice keyboard. I hate Microsoft with a passion but they did a good job with this one.
5,Love the keyboard and the variety of colors.  Easy connection.  This keyboard connects by magnet - cool!
5,Don't know how I ever got by without one! Works great and does exactly as advertised!
3,Quit working after 8 months. Was decent while it worked.
5,Love this keyboard. I have a Surface Pro 3 and it is fully compatible.
5,I love it it works great. I love how flexible it is.
5,Works great was used but like-new.
1,Shortly after I received the product about two keys stopped working. Because of this I very seldomly used the keyboard and now about 10 numbers and letter and even the “enter” key doesn’t work. For being Microsoft its a huge disappointment. Luckily I still have my Mac which I’ve now switched back to. I guess Apple really does do it better.
5,yes it's better than the pro 3 keyboard.  personally I didn't need the finger print sensor.  this keyboard is great.
3,occasional loss of connection for some reason when on my surface pro 4.. otherwise works as advertised and backlit
5,Must have for your surface. Takes some getting used to the size but works perfect.
5,So fuzzy light and fun! Thanks!
5,Huge improvement over the previous type cover.  Buttons are easier to feel and are more responsive when pressed.
1,It is like the pole torture it starts nicely it ends gruesomely. My keyboard stopped working after one year and when you look for support first think they to ask  for the honor of listening to your gripe is just a bit of your money. Betwwen this and the bloody Cortana they shovel down your throat if their Mkg guys were paid to promote Apple or Google they couldn`t do  any better
5,Works as described.
5,Love it! Good design keyboard is on an incline.  Good touch feel slightly springy.
5,Color was just what she wanted
5,Great non intrusive cover that still allows the surface to function as normal with a hard layer of protection.
5,Happy with it
5,It feels great. I feel like I am working on a laptop
5,Great product with backlit keys.
5,Works great! No issues and the keyboard is such an improvement from the surface pro 3 keyboard.
2,The keys on this keyboard are starting not to work properly and it is just a few months old. I asked for a return but the keyboard was outside of the return period. Not great.
5,Good item work correct with Surface Pro 5.
5,Nice color and works as any other surface type cover
5,Almost the same as the SP3 keyboards but has a better feel on the mouse pad. Works great!
5,This keyboard feels much better than the one for surface pro 3 especially for the touchpad.
5,this is a gift for my grand-daughter that is going off to college.  she loves it.
3,colours get stained with dust very easily and it is impossible to clean.
5,This is an excellent keyboard for use with the Surface Pro!
5,Works great with Microsoft pro 3 much better touchpad responsive magnetic. Best option available
5,I got a used one for about $80.  I literally could not tell if was actually used.
5,I love how dynamic and smooth typing on this keyboard. It certainly exceeded my expectations
5,Works great and fits great
2,I like the touch and feel or the keyboard. I like that is has lighted keys. i was very disappointed the the edge by the delete key tearing in a few days after I received it with very little use. I expected more from a Microsoft product.
5,hides the dust and scuffs better than the other color choices available
5,Works as intended without issue. Price is a bit much for what you get but we know that going in.
1,Not a heavy user and I don't travel more than few times a year . The keyboard is now only connecting intermittently .  I have done all the software and cleaning tips I could find with no success .  Ironically the problem started just outside of the warranty period and my research shows that this is a common problem.
3,This works perfectly but the suede-like material is easy to get dirty.
5,It lived up to the reviews that i read.  It should be included with the Surface Pro 4.
5,Product was as described and so far I am very happy with the purchase!
2,It's really pretty at first; however it stains easily. It is dark where my hands rest - nothing I do cleans it and brings it back to the initial color. I bought this because of its look but that wore away quickly.
5,The keys are back lit which is really great when I want to use the surface pro with out bright lights.
5,It's perfect. Nothing to say because its totally compatatible. Arrived WAY sooner than expected.
5,Works amazing great feel to the keys & mouse pad works great! Love it!
5,Works perfectly!! Came in time was brand new. Very great choice.
5,Its a keyboard  Its not a bad keyboard  and I like the feel compared to other mostly flat keyboards.
5,Perfect for my surface.
3,Easy to connect and disconnect. I wish the arrow keys were a bit larger.
5,Genuine Microsoft surface keyboard.  Quick shipping
5,Feels Great.  Works great.  Has Function keys listed on top row.
3,didn't recognize the new cover. Took lots of googling to get the proper fix
5,Version 2 is a big improvement.
3,I don't like how the keyboard doesn't have a backlight.
2,While the keyboard is nice for typing on the feel and sound is something like a sheet of cardboard. It also falls out of connection with the computer and has to be removed and re-attached in order to re-establish the link.
5,Using it to type now actually! Works perfectly and went above my expectations.
1,Keyboard only lasts about 18 months and Microsoft refuses to admit problem.  They have finally joined the rest of the world of crap for profit.  Loved the Surface Pro but getting rid of it now along with the other three I purchased for a competitors unit that gets supported.
5,Love this key board it even is back lit! Which I needed !
5,This was a gift for my husband and he likes it.
5,Cover and keyboard are just a very comfortable fit for the surface pro 4.
5,Works perfectly with the surface pro 3.  Nice upgrade over the original keyboard purchased with the 3.  Totally recommend.
5,what a joy is to use this keyboard it's light beautifully made and it completes my SP4
5,This product is original and fits perfectly on my Surface Pro 4.
2,Quit working after a month and a half. I have an otter box on it keep it stored and have done nothing to cause damage to it. It just stopped working. Restarting my surface does not help. Was awesome before it stopped.
5,great keyboard. The touchpad almost feels as good as macbook's. Also the design is simple and beautiful.
5,Great feel and design ..... couldn't be happier with this purchase.
5,It attaches by magnet. It is just as I expected very happy with it.
5,Yep!  Good
1,Really upset about my type cover. since the day i bought it the Stone Close Inc type cover for surface pro has not worked properly. the touch pad is broken and does not allow me highlight or right click. I had to buy a mouse to get my computer to work. Emailed the supplier Stone Close with no response before writing this review. thanks for nothing.
1,Dont buy this unless you are planning to keep the keyboard always in a very clean place and wash your hands thoroughly every time you use the keyboard lol!. I usually take care of my computer very well but this one got dirty regardless of all my efforts. Once it got dirty I couldn't remove the stain even after trying many cleaning liquids the stain just sticks.
1,I’ve had the keyboard since September and it has quit working they say I cannot return it I only use it once a week for school and it is no longer working
5,Item functions as expected.  Packaging could have been better in terms of protecting contents.
5,Works well and have had no issues! Love it.
5,I love the lookfeel and functionality of this keyboard.  It great.
5,Nice keyboard. Works great on Surface Pro 3. I love it.
5,Works great!  Amazing condition good as new works just as promised.
5,Great keyboard at a great price.  Apple could learn something from these keyboards for their iPads.
5,looks amazing and works great. keys are nice and responsive.
5,Works great! Fits! No problems.
5,My daughter loves it!!!
5,I love everything about this keyboard! Looks and feels amazing! Package came in quick and in a perfect condition.
5,Excelent
5,SO far my only complaint that if you tilt the keyboard down to much it turns itself off.
3,It does its job alright. Just way too expensive.
5,I've only had minor connection problems but other than that this keyboard has been great
5,I absolutely love the new Surface Pro 4 keyboard. It is a big upgrade over the Pro 3 keyboard.
5,excellent back lit keyboard love the bright red color!cover does get dirty very quick does to material
5,Awesome. I hope they give more color options for it !!
5,Great product! Works perfectly with my surface pro 4
5,I purchased this keyboard for my wife's Surface Pro 3 and it works and fits perfectly.  Great keyboard!
5,Up and down arrows key are very small rather than that having excellent experience.
5,Extremely well made. Magnets on like a boss. Mousepad is very sensitive and keys feel great. Happy camper here.
5,Great feel at typing and the mouse is sensitive enough.
5,You will forget your bad experience with last Surface Pro Keyboard.
3,Overpriced for just a simple keyboard.
1,Can't move with finger tips. Take a lot of time to react.
5,Slight delay in shipping but great keyboard. Hooked right up to Surface and works flawlessly.
5,Works very well!  Ease of fit.  Love the construction material.
1,At first my keyboard worked and we thought the second keyboard was messing up from the surface but we switched out the keyboards and yep it was the keyboard we bought from here i was very disappointed i bought 2 of these and one didnt work as soon as i got it and the second one j key stopped working smh..
5,liked most - keyboard
5,Definitely was worth the but when I bought the surface.
5,Excellent attachment. No issues.
5,Great keyboard. Essentially standard size with standard keys so feels just like any other keyboard. Works great!
5,Very comfortable to type on. A much needed improvement to the type cover 3. The trackpad is much better too.
5,A well-fitting and valuable component of the set. Good price.
5,Been only using it a few times since I got it but works well so far
5,Good stuff! Received on time.
2,While it fits my surface pro 4 just fine I've only had it for a month and already the letters are starting to fade with just nominal use.  Its definitely cheaper than others out there but you get what you pay for.
5,Fits my Surface Pro 4 perfectly. Fast shipping and delivered on time. Comes new works excellent.
5,Product delivered on time. Nice looking cover. Surface Pro 4 fits well. Very happy with product and vendor.
5,I use it for my surface pro 3. I love it. much better than the 3 keyboard.
2,touch pad is a hit or miss.  when i click it either right clicks  when i want to left click.  No pressure 'valve'  at all.  I wish the backspace button could delete all when I hold it down.
5,Great addition to the tablet and the mouse is a must.
5,I replaced the keyboard on my Surface Pro 3 with this one and typing is much more pleasant.
5,Works as it should on my Surface
5,works greatfeels greatsturdy productkeys feel like premium quality
5,Love it. Good build quality. Great look and feel. Very responsive trackpad
3,Great product but to expensive!
5,this keyboard is so easy to connect or disconnect very useful when at desk.
3,Easy to attach and detach
5,Works well sometimes cannot be detected by computer. May be a firmware problem.
2,Maybe it's just me but the magnetic part of the keep pad remain attached to the surface pro leaving the keep pad in my hands after only 2 months. Now I struggle daily trying to make this work. I  must admit I never expected that based on other reviews.
5,Much better than typer cover 3. A must-have keyboard for surface pro series.
2,The keyboard came used already. The material was not soft and the corner was ripped.
5,nice product and nice price
2,The items being sold are of an older model and do not match the pictured items or features.
5,Love this. Flips over and covers. It snaps on fast!
5,Cheaper price than the stores and the same product! It's been an easy clean too!
5,The computer has a phone style keyboard on it but that really limits your ability to use it.
5,nice feel just like a desk top keyboard.
5,Perfect fit for the Surface Pro. Very happy with the product!
5,Love the color. Works great! Love that it snaps on and off the surface pros so well.
5,Much better than the surface pro 3 keyboard
5,works perfect
5,Awesome cover/keyboard. This should be standard issue with all Notebooks.
5,Big improvement over previous models! Best tablet keyboard i have ever seen.

5,I love having this for my surface pro4!
5,Thank you. Your product works as advertised!
5,Definitely better than the original for Surface Pro 3.
5,Shipped quickly and is a perfect accessory for my Surface Pro 3.
5,Nice feel for typing and the pad.
5,Love my new keyboard! Works great shipped in a very timely manner.
5,Works very well with Surface pro 4!
1,The keyboard arrived on time but half the keyboard did not work.  All the letters on the left side did not work and the letters on the right side did.  My husband spent 2 hours trying to trouble shoot the problem. I was very disappointed
1,For something this expensive one would hope it would last. Magically the warranty (1 year) expired 2 weeks before the touchpad stopped working. No accidents spills or trauma simply just stopped functioning properly during an exam none the less. I would not recommend this product. Having to spend $100 a year for a keyboard is absolutely ridiculous.
5,Must have for Surface Pro 3 and 4 owners! Works great. Good key spacing and larger mouse pad.
5,Nice feel
5,Love the type cover. It's sturdy and not a problem typing on it.
5,Great product
1,Buenos dias he comprado 4 teclados y de ellos dos tienen defecto de fabrica las computadoras han ingresado tarde por el tramite de aduana y he realizado las pruebas en este momento y dos de ellos no funcionan y debido a que ya se vencio el tiempo no puedo realizar la devolucion.por favor su apoyo
1,It's been less than two months since I got the keyboard and its starting to work intermittently.I never know when it is going to stop working.  Disconnecting and reconnecting it doesn't fix it for long.  Neither does rebooting the tablet.I have an older keyboard that works fine so I'm pretty sure the problem is with this new keyboard.
5,Works as well as an laptop keyboard I've ever used while remaining light weight and protective.
5,I couldn't imagine using the surface pro without it.  Revolutionary products for laptop lovers and tablet users.
5,Works well on my surface pro 3.
5,Very satisfied with the microsoft keypad/cover. Received very quickly also.
5,Great sized keyboard which is a perfect match for the Surface Pro
1,Nice quality but defect. This is my 2nd purchase and both died in less than a year.

5,This was the most reasonably priced keyboard I found and I love the color!
5,Works well good snug fit on my surface 4. Nice keyboard to use.
5,love the keyboard and the money i save buying it
3,I think my keyboard has bended I do not know why.
5,It's nice and well designed. It keeps up with my fast typing.
1,The following buttons do not work on my surface pro keyboard: ~123456-+jkl:zxcv>? enterExtremely frustrated about this. Microsoft Support troubleshooting hasn't helped. I mean I've tried everything including reinstalling the drivers force shut downs restarting manual updates etc. I don't know why I bother with it really at this point it's just a dust cover for my screen. Not truly functional.
5,Pretty goog when you love typing rather than using the pen
5,Much better than the original surface keyboards. Almost no different than typing at my desktop.
3,Mouse is really jumpy
3,Received wrong item. Had to return/refund. Waste of time.
5,Great addition to my Surface Pro 4.

5,I loved it worked with the Surface pro 3
5,Authentic product...timely delivery
5,Works perfectly.  A Must-Have for your MS Surface.
1,In the last year I bought two Microsoft Surface computers both of which turned out so glitchy it is impossible to use and part of what makes them glitch out is some faulty software or hardware related to how the touch screen and keyboard relate to the computer. Do not buy a Microsoft Surface!
5,Priced less than in-store.  Great product.
5,Great product; sturdy construction; good touch response.
5,Good dark-ish red color. The key spacing is much improved from previous version of the type cover.
1,I was looking for a case that had a strap to hold the tablet in one hand. I did not realize that this one will not allow the keyboard cover to be used. Now the seller Brooklyn Parkway is making it difficult to return the item.The case itself has too many parts for a tablet case. 0 stars for the case and for the seller if possible.
5,Bought open box came with out any issues or scuffs great product
1,Some of the buttons stopped working.
5,Cover is very light and it fits perfectly with my surface!
5,Amazing! Works fantastic and the color looks just as the picture! Great buy! Very durable!

5,worked as described.. was suprised that the keyes light up...
5,Works great with Surface Pro3
2,Trackpad becomes unusable if you're resting your hands on the sides.  It starts popping out. The material doesn't clean well and is very sharp on the edges and hurts after a bit.
2,I have had this keyboard for a little over a year and it has already broke on me. I use it only when I travel and it is always protected.
5,This was a must for me owning a Surface Pro!

5,Great price for the Surface keyboard.

2,Do not like or use it
1,The keyboard was what I orders it arrived on time but it doesn't seem to work for anything but entering my password into Windows 10 (Surface Pro 4). There were no instructions with the keyboard so maybe there's some secret code dance or ritual I need to perform to get it to work as advertised...I asked so I'll see.  Oh I forgot to mention it looks great!
5,Great keyboard and really resists stains!
3,Let's are excellent. Pad is horrible.

1,This would be an awesome computer if all the great things actually worked. I've already had to call the help desk 4 times and I've only had it for two months. I'm about to call them for a fifth time.
1,First of all this Order was incorrect. The keyboard cover I ordered was supposed to be blue. The cover that came was black. The cover was damaged looked used. I paid to much for this key board to be used and to be the wrong color
5,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO

5,Although tempted I resisted the urge to upgrade from a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 to a Surface Pro 4 (or Surface Book for that matter). Fortunately several of the upgraded peripherals designed in conjunction with the Surface Pro 4 including the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover and Pen are backwards compatible with the Surface Pro 3. So while I don’t get the benefits of the bigger screen and faster processor I do get to enjoy a new keyboard and pen experience.One of the first things I noticed about the new keyboard cover is that the buttons are all well spaced apart. On the original Surface Pro 3 keyboard all of the keys were right next to each other with no breathing room. The old way worked without much complaint but the new way is decidedly better. I also like the addition of a PrtScn (Print Screen) key (pulling double duty with F7) that was missing from the previous keyboard as well as the addition of a right mouse/menu key. Combined with the enhanced typing experience this keyboard is a big improvement in every way while fitting almost exactly the same.Another key improvement of the keyboard is the trackpad which is a significant advancement on the already improved trackpad on the old Surface Pro 3 Type Cover. It’s oversized and smooth as silk. While I despise trackpads in general in my limited time with this one I can say without a doubt that I’ll be reaching for my wireless Logitech trackball far less.As for the pen it’s a radical redesign. Now it’s roughly pencil shaped (angled body) with a discrete erase button that serves multiple other functions depending upon how you click it. It feels great in the hand and you can really tell the difference with the new pen tip. It definitely does a far better job of simulating writing on a traditional surface. While I haven’t tried out the other included pen tips I’ll have something to look forward to as time permits. As it is with my test drawings it was a real treat.This time around no pen loop is included. I still have my third party pen loop on my Surface Pro 3 itself so I’ll be making use of that. While this new Surface Pen does indeed have a far stronger magnet to attach to the right side of the unit even the most powerful magnet doesn’t do great when tossed about in a bag. I’ll be erring on the side of safety. With that said for casual use I’ll have no issues with letting it snap itself to the ride side of the unit when that’s more convenient than slipping it into the loop.If you type a lot like I do on the Surface Pro 3 I wholeheartedly recommend the keyboard upgrade. Even if you don’t type a lot the greatly improved trackpad may be the type of enhanced functionality you didn’t know you were missing out on. The pen is a definite upgrade but if you don’t use the pen a lot there’s probably less incentive to upgrade that. Either way if you’re a Surface Pro 3 owner and have Surface Pro 4 envy this is a great way to reap some of the benefits of what would otherwise be a far larger monetary (and frankly time) investment.
1,Very buggy mouse pad.
5,The Signature keyboard cover is actually my second as it didn't exist when I bought my SP4 near launch. My original one was the light blue which is still doing great. I'll be reviewing the Signature cover both from the perspective on how the type cover in general does and whether the increased price relative to other type covers is worth it.I really don't need to use a whole lot nuance here: the keyboard cover is absolutely top notch. I'm really sensitive about my keyboards and I had assumed that some of the typing quality would be sacrificed for the benefit of thinness an understandable compromise.But there was no such compromise. This is as good as the best laptop keyboards I've ever tried. In my opinion it's even better than the Surface Book's.There's a surprising amount of travel and feedback in key presses. It's directly comparable to a high quality desktop keyboard although not quite to Cherry MX Blue level (understandably).I don't really need backlighting but it's a nice touch.The touchpad is excellent too. It's really large and feels great.The type cover basically makes the SP4 a laptop replacement. Without it or had it been mediocre instead of great it would have just been a fancy tablet.It's not totally perfect though. I would really like to have dedicated multimedia controls. I don't like having to toggle between function keys and media keys although this is increasingly common these days and unlike most laptop keyboards there really isn't any room left to do that in the first place.The type cover's design has some subtle advantages that weren't at first obvious to me. For instance if I spill something on the cover or if I scratch it badly or if I wear the print off of the keys unlike a normal laptop and I can just replace it.Moving on to the specific Signature/Alcantara model: here we're getting very subjective.I suppose the first question to address is whether this is an upgrade you need over the more affordable type covers. The answer is unquestionably no. All of the modern type covers are superb and the quality of the actual stuff you use (keys/touchpad) they're identical.So the crucial question is which color or your favorite. I adore my blue type cover but it's not the most professional choice out there. The Signature however is going to blend in nicely in almost any environment.The Alcantara fabric itself is very nice but keep in mind that at least in terms of how it feels the only different is on the front (non-keyboard) side. On the keyboard side it's just as hard as any of the other type covers.I really like how the Alcantara looks namely the mottled grey. I also like that it's going to hide dust and contaminants better than a solid colored cover.So to recap:1: Is the Type Cover (of any color) good?Yes. It's amazingly good.2: Do I need the Alcantara/Signature model?No but if you think it's the best looking one and have the money then you should definitely get it. If you like the red one conversely just get the red one. The difference in quality is not night and day between this and the others so you're not going to really miss out on anything by going with your favorite color.I'm happy with mine.
4,I've had this keyboard/cover for about 3 months.  I was very concerned at first about how well it would hold up and how comfortable it would be to type on.  I've been pleasantly surprised at how well it has held up and functional it is.  The touch pad works well but I ended up buying a bluetooth mouse and prefer to use it whenever possible.  I don't fold the cover over when using it as a tablet and just pull it off instead.  I have the tablet setup to switch to tablet mode whenever I take the keyboard off.  It seems to work pretty.  The computer shuts down well when the cover is closed also.If you have a Surface Pro 3 or 4 you should have this.  It is everything you should expect.  The only thing I could complain about it the price but if you paid the premium for a Surface Pro does that really matter?
4,I don't give reviews immediately I use the products for months first and give honest feedbacks.I bought this 4 months ago.The delivery was on time and the product was properly packaged. As stated the keyboard is "snap attach and go" it was just that. When the keyboard was connected it automatically sync with my surface pro. The draw back for not giving it 5 stars is that the keyboard has velvety clothy covering which is easy attraction of debris/dust particles. I don't mind the text where the keys are but it can be a little annoying to be brushing/cleaning the back. Overall it's a good product and everything works. Keys have back lighting which is awesome  and are comfortable to type with.
4,Works perfectly with the Surface Pro 3.Pro's:- Good build quality- Attachment setup to the Surface is excellent.  The magnet holds well and you can slap it on in the dark- Folds behind the Surface Pro 3 nicely and it automatically discovered to be in Auto Rotate mode- Keys type well with a good feel- Trackpad works well...better than many dedicated laptop track pads- Folds up at a slight angle for lap use as wellCon's:- Price- The felt material on the back feels like it will show stains and wear quickly.  Nothing after 1+ month of use but I've been very careful- No magnetic closure onto my Surface Pro 3The three con's caused me to ding it one star.
4,i got this keyboard with my surface pro 4 ( and overall it is one of the best membrane keyboard i have ever usedthe only problem i have with it is the fact that when you pull it off on one side too much it will break (note it will still work)the picture that was taken is where it breaks
5,I got this particular product for much cheaper as part of a bundle from the Microsoft Store. The pattern of the material is quite eye catching and gets people to walk by and want to touch it. However the material itself doesn't feel particularly fancy or expensive. This is coming from someone who has never really used any of the other Surface colors.It looks so much nicer to the eye than the cheap and gaudy blue color that is in promotional material. I have a close up look on my Youtube Channel if you type in Otto Andersson Surface Pro 4. The keys are a bit loud for typing than one may expect but it's quite a pleasure to type on this thing. Feel free to ask more specific questions in the comments or on my Youtube Video.
4,The keys have a great feel... I didn't see in the description that the key board was velvety... I  was hoping out was all rubber... other than that it is a great product.
4,Expensive but necessary.  Bought it from MS not Amazon.  Haven't had it long enough to be convinced it is worth the extra money.  I normally don't use a keyboard for my work.  On the tablet I draw mostly.  I got this to protect the screen.
4,Works well. Just wished it could stand the computer up independently vs requiring the use of the computer's backstand
4,Backlit and decent key action. Trackpad is more than servicable.Happy
4,I enjoy writing on the keyboard.
4,as expected
4,The keyboard is much better than the surface 3 cover. The fingerprint reader works like 85% of the time though which is a bummer. Hopefully software will fix it.
3,So I just bought the Surface Pro 4 (i7 16GB Ram) and the Teal Type Cover from the Microsoft Store in a mall. This is my 3rd Surface purchase...but the only one I intend to keep as my daily mobile laptopish machine. I mostly think it's great...and the new touch cover is mostly perfect...except for one thing that I hate: The trackpad is way too slow for my tastes and there's no way to adjust it. It's probably fine for people that want precision but I want to be able to move the mouse across the screen with one swipe. As it is now...I have to use 3-4 swipes to move the mouse from one side of the screen to the other. This is highly inefficient. I've looked at the settings for the trackpad and there's no option to adjust the acceleration or movement sensitivity or speed at least not that I can find...so I'm really disappointed. Yes I can use the actual touchscreen but that covers up the screen with my hand and some tasks require that you both navigate with your mouse and see everything on screen...and the trackpad is less fatiguing with extended use...so I'm not super happy with the type cover...though I'm not sure if it's the hardware to blame or Windows. Either way the hardware team could have easily allowed trackpad sensitivity to be an option as it is on almost every other trackpad...so I think the blame lies with them. Thusly until this option is visible I'm only going to give the type cover 3 stars.In every other regard I find the type cover pretty awesome though it does seem a bit overpriced when you consider that I already spent nearly 2 grand on just the computer/screen. All the keys and their springyness is perfect for a laptop...and the backlight is great. I'm happy that there is both a delete key and a backspace key (which I find essential if you write and edit your writing). I also think the trackpad feels and works great (if the mouse didn't move so little!) and once I can adjust the tracking speed of the trackpad I think this type cover will become the perfect companion for the Surface Pro.
3,Had a weird experience with this one. I originally purchased the black type cover but what showed up was different. The item I received was the barker blue type cover which honestly looks better in person than in the pictures (i prefer it over the black). But the real problem came the inability to pair this keyboard to my surface pro 4. I spent a good chunk of time on the phone with Microsoft to try and fix this problem to no avail. Luckily I was able to return this item so no harm no foul.P.s.already bought a replacement type cover it's a great product I would recommend it over the other blue tooth counterparts
3,I like the keyboard. It feel smooth when typing. The cover is nice but it attract dirt and dust. I try to use a wet tower but when the cover gets damp the dirt on the cover gets darker. When it's dry the dirt remains. The whole edge of the cover is covered by dirt. I used to have a light blue cover it was even worse. Wish I can find a leather or faux leather cover. It would be easier to just wipe it clean. It looks like the only choice to is to get a black cover?
5,Works perfectly with my Surface Pro 4 I purchased. It was not hard to adjust to typing on the keys compared to a regular keyboard. Typing feels great. Obviously its a bit smaller than a typical keyboard because its for a tablet but it still is a good size to where its not small. I was worried about the track-pad being too small but its working out just fine. Must have for a Surface Pro
5,The material that Microsoft used on this keyboard feels fantastic. I wish it came in different colors though as the grey color is very bland. The keyboard is also VERY expensive; and this is on top of the premium price you pay for a regular Surface Pro keyboard. However if you have some cash to spend and dont mind paying for something that stands out just because you can it is highly recommended.
3,This is not a quality built item in my opinion. I have been using it just over a year at my desk it almost never moves. It has constant connection issues despite being physically connected to the Surface. The keys are junk and the type feeling is just not enjoyable. Spend the $15 extra to get the Brydge 12.3 wayyyyyyyyyyyy better
3,It's a beautiful product - hands down. However it's very difficult to clean. I wash my hands often but the grease builds up very quickly and visibly on this keyboard - where the hands usually rest while typing. Because of the make-up of the material the grease is also very hard to remove so the appearance wears down within a couple of months. That's very unfortunate. I'd give this 5 stars if I could but I bought the keyboard because of its appearance and it has worn away.PS. The outside of the cover still looks great though.
5,This thing is lovely. Protects my SP4's screen and it's a nice keyboard to boot. The keys are backlit and have enough "click" to them that they are relatively satisfying to type on and I don't dread using the touchpad. The touchpad feels nice and support intuitive gestures although I had to turn off pinch to zoom since it was zooming in occasionally when I would try to scroll in Chrome. It's also very easy to attach/detach.
5,This is simply awesome. I've accidentally spilled 2 drinks on the keyboard .. given I dry it immediately and there has been no issue AT ALL with the function. A+. May want to get the fingerprint cover as my friend has the same one if you have the money which is a cool additional feature.
5,I drove over to the mall and bought this at the Microsoft Store because I wanted the bright blue (cyan) color and Amazon (and Microsoft online) didn't have it in stock.  As others mentioned I had to upgrade the software on my Surface Pro 3 before the keyboard would work.  This took only a few minutes.  I just love it.  It is a major improvement over the old cover and the trackpad is great.  Previously I frequently used a separate keyboard and mouse with my Surface.  With this new cover the need to do that will go away.  I thought about going all the way and getting a Surface 4 but this is enough of an upgrade that I am happy.
5,I bought this today (at Best Buy--not Amazon) for my Surface Pro 3.  The good news is this works perfectly--and I'm writing this review on it at the moment.  In fact this keyboard is superior to the original (SP3) keyboard in virtually every respect.  The keys are nicely spaced and have better travel.  Also the fingerprint id scanner works better than I even imagined (easy set up; recognition in a fraction of a second).My only complaint--and it's a very minor one--is that the keyboard does not seem to have as strong of a magnetic connection to the SP3 screen when attached and placed in the typing position.  Truth be told it's not enough to make a difference (to me).
5,Love this type cover for my Surface Pro 3. I upgrade from the Surface Pro 3 Type Cover and it has a made a world of difference.  It's almost like a brand new laptop!  It feel extra sturdy the keys are spaced and much easier to type with and the felt material feel so much nicer.
5,Likely one of the nicest keyboards I have used it just has a right feel to it.  I am happy that they have made several improvements over the surface pro 3 keyboard such as the spacing out of the keys and the highly improved track pad.  A must have for any surface model that will support it.  Only downside is the price but for how nice it is I am not surprised.
5,I bought the red cover with my SP is Microsoft Store. God this one is amazing and I have been a Lenovo user and own a Razer Blade two top keyboard experience in the market and honestly I feel no difference in this one. That can be defined as enjoyable typing finally for Surface franchise.Touchpad is OK at the beginning. After the TH2 update that can be called a match to the Macbook. Update as soon as possible.About the price well it is still overpriced. But I feel much better when Apple release a 169 bucks garbage.
5,I love this cover/keyboard!  It has a great suede feel to it.
5,The keyboard is brand new and there is nothing wrong with it. it's perfect so far
5,Technology is quite the amazing thing. This updated keyboard is light years better than the last type cover. I replaced the SP3 type cover yesterday and the SP3 just feels better almost like a new laptop. The board is more rigid the keys are far more stable and the overall experience is better. There is still some "bounce" when using it at an angle but it's a way better experience. Microsoft is really upping their game. It's just too bad I can't change this stupid login screen hero banner on Win 10.
5,This is an incredible improvement over the original Surface Pro 3 cover. The keys have just enough key travel to facilitate accurate typing and the trackpad is amazingly better! It's actually a pleasure to use the trackpad instead of a gamble with the old type cover.  Definitely worth the money and I've only had it for a day.There is a model with an integrated fingerprint reader but this model does not include it. You can only get the fingerprint reader in the black edition.
5,Perfect keyboard match to the Surface Pro4.
5,Robust typing experience. The keys are better positioned the layout changes to keys like the Fn and home keys is welcome. In general the trackpad is much improved larger and more responsive but it still isn't perfect (disclaimer - no trackpad is perfect not the almighty Apple has managed it yet). I enjoy the improved rigidity and having a surface 3 pro only miss the pen loop - however the charging port is magnetized so the pen does nestle nicely there.
5,The pleasant surprises are that the keys click and they all light up. This is not true for the color model keyboards.
5,My wife bought this for me as a gift.  This is a much better typing experience than with the original type cover for the SP3.  A must have upgrade for any SP3 owner.  The trackpad is like butter.  I actually said aloud “ooooooooh” when I first used it.  Don’t wait and get one of these now!
5,Good tactile keyboard.  Better than I had expected. Easy to attach and detach.  Long term use will be more revealing.
5,Amazing keyboard big improvement since the surface pro 3 keyboard board cover. There is a lot of travel and I could actually hit "space" withoutitglitchinglikethis. I recently had to replace my surface pro 3 keyboard cover while testing it in store--as it turns out--the surface pro4 keyboard work on the surface pro 3 laptop.
5,Product arrived fast looks great. I recommend
5,Works very well with my Surface Pro 3 as well.
5,Awesome  i love it
5,Thanks I received  my product :)
5,It was fast shipping and works great.
5,Just like what I expected
5,Delivered on tim exactly as specified
1,At the start of my graduate program the school gave a Microsoft surface pro to all the students. I promptly ordered the recommended keyboard and have been incredibly disappointed.In the past 10 months or so of moderate use multiple keys have fallen off and the keyboard itself randomly decides not to work. I regularly have to detach and reattach the keyboard for a few min until it decides to work again.This sort of quality is something I would expect of a $20 knock off keyboard not a branded $100 keyboard from Microsoft. Additionally many other students in my program got the same keyboard and have experienced similar issues indicating that I did not receive a defective product but that the overall quality of this keyboard is sub-par.Frustrated and disappointed with this product
5,Definitely worth the upgrade from the Type cover 3 on a surface pro 3.It feels like typing in a Mac Book which is great.
1,It’s a good keyboard but the quality is less than stellar. It works great when it does but about a year into having it it starts being finicky about connecting and after two years of having it the keyboard won’t reconnect after being flipped back unless I close the tablet entirely and even then it’s a gamble if it reconnects. I use it in “studio mode” quite a lot so it might be my heavy use of it but it could be made better especially since my last Surface met a similar fate.
5,I have purchased that keyboard for surface pro 3 and I must say that it is significant upgrade :)One thing is that you have to install latest firmware upgrade in order to use it.
5,First time shopping in amazon it is very good.
5,Very nice and easy to attach. It almost attached itself.
1,My husband bought me a new one for Christmas because some of the keys on mine have started to wear out. I have LOVED the original cover!The one that came is clearly too small. It does clip on but doesn’t cover the screen. It is smaller than the measurements on the listing too. They are doing a refund but insist it is a universal cover that fits all surfaces. Clearly not.I want the one that measures what they advertise and fits my surface.
5,Best version yet. Feel very nice.
2,It clips on and off very easily with a nice snap sound. It also works just fine to type with though it had no 10-key.My biggest gripe is it's touchpad. It's terrible. Since there are no buttons the touchpad is also where you press to click. Many times I'm trying to simply click on something and I end up moving the cursor and clicking on something else.If the touchpad issue could be fixed this could easily be a 5★ product. Since using the mouse is such an integral part of a laptop I can't rate this product well at all.
1,The mouse pad sensibility is very bad doesn't works as the original one. very dissapointed.
1,Microsoft cover is good as long as it works.Troubles start with MS warranty service here is the list of them:1. Finding the phone number: 40 min2. After spending 2hr. on the phone running all tests and upgrades replacement or repair case is not being created.3. After complaining to BBB ms representative called but did nothing so far for 3 days.
1,My Surface Pro 3 stopped working with the expensive Microsoft keyboard about a year ago. I have two keyboards and they both stopped at the same time. Hours and days of rebooting research repeated two-button restarts downloading the original image for a USB clean install updating with the latest Windows updates for days and weeks--nothing works. Online research has shown that Microsoft has so far been unable to solve this problems with many Surface Pro users. Blue Tooth alternatives are now the only way out if you want to use a keyboard with the Surface Pro without using up its ONLY USB port.
1,I've used this for 2 days and its already broken. I have had trouble with the enter and v key the entire time- they weren't working and then this happened. I went to pull it off the tablet at Microsoft's advice to take off and reattach it and a piece broke off. I'm so frustrated with this keyboard.
2,The touchpad is jumps right before clicking on something maybe 10% of the time. This gets really annoying.The cursor will also just freeze for a half second or sometimes up to 3 seconds and become unresponsive. I'm not sure if this is the type cover's fault or the surface pro 4 device fault.Both of these problems seem reasonably common but not everyone has them.
2,Bluetooth disconnects often
2,right shift broken within 3 months.
1,Very poor I just placed inside my computer backpack (with my surface pro 4) and then I found the corner seriously deformed and found that the metal plate come out from the silicon wrap for usage just for 2 weeks.Write to Microsoft store also but no reply ever I can only manage to hand carry it to avoid silicone cracks propagation.
1,Despite claims otherwise the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover does not "mate" correctly with SP3 Docking Stations. I have purchased several Type covers for SP3's.  I've done so because I kept experiencing tracking problems with the track-pad on SP3 type cover (the track-pad on the SP3 type covers consistently had jerky/erratic movement). I know that I am not alone with this issue since a number of people I've spoken with both on my development team as well as others who bought SP3's indicated they've had the same identical issue with their SP3 type cover track-pads resulting in jerky/erratic movement. Several of these people indicated they believed it was some sort of a design flaw with the SP3 Type Cover track-pad. After forking out $100+ each for more SP4 and SP3 keyboards to fix what is essentially a bug in the SP3 Type cover I am relieved to find SP3 track-pad issues have been fixed when using the SP4 type cover with SP3. However despite claims otherwise the SP4 type cover does not "mate" correctly with the SP3 docking station (even when the keyboard is laid flat) placement of the Surface in the dock is error prone and leads to connection jams. At the price point of the surface line and because we've had to purchase additional $100+ keyboards my team has decided against further purchases of Microsoft Surface.
1,I bought my surface pro 4 a few months ago and the key board has problem. it is not being recognized once you detach it and reattach to the computer.
1,Whaaaaa ????  This KB is $159 at Best Buy.
1,Bought the used Type Cover(backed up by Amazon); didn't work.
4,U know what to expect when u buying used item so it works but keyboard was a bit dirty. Nothing that some cleaning didnt fix but still company should take a second and do this.
1,Has no place for my pen cost a fortune. I got ripped off. I should have got one under 50 bucks with a lighted kb and blue keys
4,Too much card board.
5,It was a good buy works as expected no issues
4,Muy practico y liviano.
5,Love that it does not have to be charged. Is a nice texture and color to go along with other MS accessories!
5,Great product
5,This is working well for me. I would recommend.
5,Exact what I ordered and like the original product that comes with surface pro
5,My original surface pro key board wore out and I needed a replacement. This is perfect. Plugged it in and I was back in business.
4,the backlighting on this is so weak.  so much confusion about how to turn backlighting on.  it is f7 function key and shuts off quickly.  it is motion controlled.This same keyboard is selling on microsoft store for 20.00 less.  Amazon would't  match the price.  Shame on you.
5,College graduation gift  Granddaughter said it was perfect.
4,This company shipped out my keyboard the same day I ordered it arrived to me on an island a few days later! The fastest I have received anything. Excellent condition and works like it's brand new. Would 100% buy again from this company.
5,It works perfectly with your Surface Pro
5,Got the product fast and it's almost as if it's new.
2,I bought this as a replacement for my current keyboard also made by Microsoft since my current one frequently loses its track pad functionality making it very difficult to work with. However this keyboard is no different. I had hoped that a year or so later Microsoft would have improved this product but it seems that this keyboard is just glitchy and cumbersome - and expensive!
4,Good
5,This product is excellent for use with my new Surface Pro 4. I found a brand new one with a very good discount by shopping around online and it works perfectly. Of course it is dedicated for use with the Surface Pro 3 and 4 so its pricey cost is justified. It works just as it should. It attaches and detaches in one second with the incredible magnetic pins! This is a big bonus in my office when I go from taking notes with the stylus pen on the tablet to turning it into an instant laptop for typing in details and making appointments on Outlook. It is backlit for dimmer environments and the keys are spaced and sized to be easy to use for fast touch typing. Delivery was very fast.
5,Comprei para conectar em microsoft surface pro e tinha ficado na dúvida se daria certo. Deu certo e está funcionando satisfatoriamente. O antigo que eu tinha possuía um cabo para recarregar não era original. Esse que acabei de comprar basta encostar no surface pro e funciona perfeitamente. Arrisquei meu dinheiro na compra porque na descrição não estava claro se funcionaria com microsoft surface pro 7 e deu certo.
5,Don't get me wrong at first when I saw the price I was like "why does this cost more than my Corsair keyboard for this thin cardboard looking keyboard?" But holy was I wrong the price fits it very well for what it can do. Its super thin (as I said in the beginning) and has a white back-light which you can adjust on the keyboard. The magnet is super super strong so if you gotta blast and don't have time somehow to fold the keyboard its gonna be stuck like glue. It puts your tablet in sleep mode when folded over the screen (so does the keyboard when folded). Also when you want to fold it behind the tablet to use your tablet for touchy touchy the keyboard turns off and when you are "AFK" or just watching videos or reading the keyboard dimes itself and when touched it comes to life. It is powered with the tablet so you don't need to charge the keyboard. I haven't seen any battery drops and it lasted awhile for me. (Fyi: I'm writing this review with the keyboard.)
5,If you're planning to buy a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 for sure buy the keyboard.  I suffered along in tablet mode using the virtual keyboard on the tablet for months.  The problem is the virtual keyboard takes up half the tablet (in horizontal mode).  If you're trying to write an email you can only type two lines before the next lines disappear under the virtual keyboard.  A pain in the you-know-where.  So my advice is to spend the extra money and purchase the keyboard cover right at the start to avoid frustrations.
5,Como lo comento en el título es un teclado excelente para mi surface mas el único pero que le encuentro es que Microsoft no hizo o no produjo un teclado con disposición latinoamericana entonces ya sea que en la surface se debe cambiar el teclado e ignorar los símbolos que vienen en las teclas o usar el teclado estadounidense y usar teclas especiales para los caracteres latinos como la Ñ
5,The surface pro keyboard works perfectly! It arrived shockingly fast as well. The keyboard feels great to type on and the track pad is better than trackpads I've had on much higher end devices and feel wise it feels equal to that of a Mac Book Pro's trackpad. I can easily recommend this product
3,I don't know if the problems I have are because of the type cover or Windows but I have intermittent problems with the type cover.The mouse goes crazy every now and then randomly going around the screen clicking.Sometimes disconnecting and reconnecting solves it and sometimes I have to reboot the Surface Pro 4. Sometimes it just fixes itself.
1,In total I bought two Surface Pro 4 Type cover from Kanga Supply. First one arrived and found it was defective with a few keys not working so I thought might be a lemon and decided to send it back. However I bought another one from Kanga Supply again thinking it was only my bad luck from the first one. The second one arrived and again!! the same problem happened with about 10 keys not working. I'm very frustrated and never will buy from Kanga Supply again. This is a terrible experience and I'll never purchase anything from them again. I'd rather buy from Microsoft now paying the full price.
5,La Surface Pro 4 es un gran dispositivo pero es un hibrido por lo que para sacarle todo el jugo posible este teclado es el compañero ideal.Se conecta mediante unos pines magnéticos en unas entradas ubicadas debajo de la Surface Pro.Este teclado es original de Microsoft y es compatible -aparte de la Surface Pro 4- con la Surface Pro 3.👍👍PUNTOS POSITIVOS👍👍-Es un teclado ergonómico: La separación de teclas y su mecanismo de tijera hace que escribir con el sea muy cómodo.-Es retroiluminado: Algo muy bueno por si necesitamos escribir en un espacio con poca luz o a oscuras podemos regular el iluminado de las teclas con el mismo teclado.-El Touchpad esta excelente tiene un tacto muy suave se siente como cristal con terciopelo la precisión es también muy buena y podemos hacer sin problemas los gestos de Windows 10.-Es suave al tacto al estar construido en terciopelo.-Nos sirve para proteger la pantalla del Tablet al estar conectado mediante los pines magnéticos.P.D. Los teclados que se venden en Amazon MX están en Ingles por lo que recomiendo que al configurarla pongan la distribución de teclado en Ingles Internacional pues así con Alt Derecho+N podremos escribir la Ñ.
5,Must have if you own either the Surface Pro 3 or 4. Should be included if you buy the 4 but that's a different discussion. Much better than the Pro 3 keyboard and can be found discounted on Amazon sometimes if you can wait.
3,Excellent quality but BEWARE. I received one unit which touchpad was faulty it was very erratic when plugged via AC. Once unplugged the touchpad worked normally. I'm shipping this unit back to get a replacement and I hope the next one will be better because that's one of the best keyboard I've tried so far. Especially for a cover case this keyboard even rocks my Macbook Pro's 2013 keyboard. Recommended but test it well on reception since their quality insurance department seems to be snoozing out.
5,Was looking for a keyboard for my MS surface pro 3.  This was on at a reduced price because it was slightly used.  I bought it because I can't resist a deal and I needed a keyboard.  It arrived very fast was in excellent condition. . It is for a surface pro 4 but works like a charm on my pro 3. Very happy with my purchase.
5,Looks a little bent when you look at it flat but cheaper here than at the Microsoft store and works with no issues.  The cosmetic "bent product" is my only issue but it doesn't bother me.  Still looks good when it's closed on my Surface Pro 4 and again it works flawlessly.
5,I lost my 'old' SP3 keyboard on a flight somewhere.The new Pro 4 keypad fit nicely on the SP3. But didn't connect automaticallyI had to unpair the old one then pair this new one.After that it worked great.
5,Works great!  I think every Surface needs one of these.  Not sure why Microsoft sells them separately well obviously it's a way to make extra money but if you buy a surface make sure you buy the keyboard attachment as well.
2,Bonjour je viens de m'acheter et d'avoir le clavier pour mon surface pro il ne fonctionne pas. La lettre c ne fonctionne pas. Comment je fait pour avoir un autre et qui fonctionne svp.  C'est j'en ai besoin c'est pour mon travail ce surface laMerci de me répondre le plus vite
5,Great quality compared to the surface pro 3 type cover keyboard. The larger trackpad and better key spacing is useful as well
5,I'm very happy with this keyboard. I went for the most inexpensive option by buying the red version of this keyboard. Why there is any variance on price is beyond my understanding? It's a solid product for the Surface Pro 4.
2,I really wanted this to work. The colour is beautiful and bright. However within two days a couple keys stopped working. Very frustrated returning the product. Guess I'll be going with a boring colour from the Microsoft website.
5,Keyboard works very well performs like a regular laptop keyboard and very comfortable to use. the back light really helps when working in low lighting and keystrokes are performed wonderfully.Garnet
2,Bought it a year ago. Everything worked perfectly until September. Cap G and H stopped working plus second function of 8 9 and 0.I managed it until yesterday where it stopped working completely! You don't usually buy it to be useful for less than a year. Disappointed in a long run.
5,Fantastic feel to the keyboard!  Love the backlight and how easy it snaps into place with the magnetic pull.  I would have bought the one with the fingerprint scanner but did not see it before I bought this one.
5,These keyboards attach quickly and easily with magnets.The keys "click" like a normal keyboard and have good "feel".The touchpad works quite well.
5,Made for the Microsoft Surface Pro this keyboard cover just snapped into place and worked immediately. Simple and easy to use it provides a solid tactile feel to the typing and mousing experience.
1,It was working good for the first few weeks.But now the mouse touch pad is having problems.It works only sometimes. Is there any warranty for this product? Can I exchange it for another?
5,Arrived in 5 working days  Item exactly as described. The whole process went as smooth as s peeled egg
4,Quite comfortable to type on. Nicely lit. Light and attaches and detaches from the Surface quite easily. A bit expensive
5,Updated my broken Surface Pro 3's typecover with this one. It fits and it MUCH better quality. Happy camper over here.
5,I really like the ease of use of the keyboard. the keys are nicely spaced and very responsive. It was exactly as I expected it to be
5,this this is worth the money. i had the sp3 case before and this is miles ahead of the old one. it feels like an actual keyboard!
4,Looks nice works great. I just wish there was a way that the keyboard would stick to the surface and remain closed rather than flop around everywhere. But it does what you want it to.
5,cant get enough of this keyboard makes the surface experience way better.. can use it for work writing documents.. say goodbuy to laptops
5,Super product.  Would buy again
4,It's fine. Except it is French. We found out it is just as expensive to send it back. Almost as the price we paid for it. So we kept it.
3,The keyboard is handy and works fairly well.  However it reacts much more slowly then I'd like and the touch pad can be non responsive.  I find that iI'm using the touch screen key board about 50% of the time.
5,The color is great in my opinion. And the white letters contrast really well with the teal so it pops out a lot!
5,Delivered quickly better then the original keyboard. Would highly recommend this for your surface!
5,Love this keyboard.  Works perfectly with my surface pro and was over 50 dollars cheaper than other stores!!!
5,Llegó en perfectas condiciones y antes de tiempo todo original considerando que es versión americana (ingles) es español solo que se importe desde España. Recomendable!
5,I absolutely love the feel to it it does take a little while for my surface pro to recognize its attached but other than that I love it!
5,Perfect
5,Used for a year already. Love it
3,Edit: over time because of the minor flex of the keyboard the trackpad and the mouse buttons have become unresponsive.Excellent keyboard. The trackpad is exceptional and to be honest I was expecting much worse. This is worth the money compared to other knock off brands.
1,All of the keys for my left hand (eg: from the A column to G column) do not work. Also the spacebar and function keys do not work.
5,Love it. Worked as promised.
4,Works great no problems.
5,Muy buen teclado su costo es elevado pero vale mucho la pena. Casi no le añade peso a la Surface y se note que está muy bien hecho.
5,That's the original keyboard from Microsoft but cheaper at Amazon I do recommend it ;)
5,buen producto con material ligero; lastima que no lo compre para idioma espanol y hay que estar colocando acentos y tildes
5,works great on my surface pro 3
5,Love the colour the feel and how light it is.
4,Bastante comodo y adaptable a la pantalla.Lo malo es que el teclado no viene en español y a veces como que se traba el mouse
5,Works great as expected and was delivered on time. No issues at all and the color stands out nicely!
5,Much better deal than in stores for virtually same product. Works perfect with Surface Pro 4.
5,Can go wrong works with my Surface Pro 4 and the new Surface Pro 2017.
4,I like this keyboard good build and light.
4,Works great but sometimes needs to be disconnected and reconnected when the computer is out of sleep in order to work.
5,A much needed improvement to anyone using a surface 3 keyboard on a daily basis.
5,Excelente
5,Major upgrade over the sp3 type cover.
5,Es el complemento perfecto para la surface 4 de muy buena calidad lo han mejorado bastante desde la 1er generación el mouse pasó mucho más cómodo y grande
5,Very nice about $40 cheaper than what I could find in other stores.
1,Had problems with this did not seem to stay connected.
5,Great keyboard! Love the colour. Has been very reliable so far
5,I am very pleased with the cover delighted that it is dark enough to hide most stains and yet pretty enough to delight.
5,So soft. So smooth.
5,Great! Except the bottom of it should be made of a harder material. I sometimes get scared it will get ripped or something when travelling with it
5,Attractive and easy to use just click in in place and it automatically starts working. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with the Surface.
2,Way to flexible.
5,This is an excellent keyboard for my Surface Pro great value for money compared to buying from a MS Supplier
5,A very good price for a simplistic yet functional keyboard.
5,Back-lit feature with gradual change of brightness is awesome!
5,Muy buen producto y llego antes de lo esperado cumple con lo que necesitaba para el trabajo de oficina a
4,$170 for a keyboard that wasn't included in a $1000+ tablet/laptop seems a little unfair. Keyboard could use a numberpad decent quality though.
5,recomendad ampliamente excelente vendendor un producto de alta calidad y a un precio muy competitivo lo recomiendo ampiamente gracias por la venta
5,nice happy with this product
5,Perfect! Got it on sale which never happens. Works perfectly and is definitely needed for anyone with a Surface.

4,really wish there was a control button on right side of space bar instead of the weird right click button thing
4,La cubierta teclado de la Surface funciona muy bien las teclas tienen un tacto muy bueno y el touchpad me parece mejor que el que tenía la Surface 2.Le quité una estrella porque es la versión en Inglés y esperaba la versión en español al ser un producto que se vende en Amazon México. Es cierto que es igual al que aparece en la foto por lo que decidí no regresarlo al proveedor. Creo que sería conveniente para el comprador ya sea especificar que es la versión en inglés o mejor ofrecer la versión en español.
1,A huge improvement over the Surface Pro 3 keyboard but sadly just as unreliable. I'm officially giving up on Microsoft products. I'm on my 3rd type cover (two of them were gen 3) and 2nd RMA'd Surface tablet. It's a shame because the build quality and feel of the whole package is quite nice. But it's just way too much of a headache to deal with all the keyboard disconnects trackpad disconnects random system crashes and 100 other glitches that come with this whole experience. While the concept is 10/10 the execution is so poor that you end up wasting $1000's in lost productivity. And if I were to factor in Microsoft support my score would be around -900 stars. When my first keyboard started to fail they suggested I glue the key back in place. I gave up and went to best buy where I was about to yell at the Microsoft store rep but he immediately gave me a replacement. And acknowledged and apologized for the horrendous customer service Microsoft provides. Getting the actual tablet replaced was a living nightmare. It took hours of arguing on the phone countless followup emails and images with proof and I had to endure all the stupid suggested fixes that I had already done anyway. Yet somehow Microsoft thinks Consumer Report's rating of the Surface being the most unreliable laptop/tablet is FALSE?! HAH. I hope they end up with a class-action lawsuit for DENYING FACTS and fooling millions into thinking they have a solid product. Don't get me wrong the Surface is gorgeous the pen works pretty well and it just feels quality in the hand. But the thousands of bugs and glitches will put you on the brink of suicide. Microsoft scored the lowest in reliability out of ALL OTHER PC MANUFACTURERS according to Consumer Reports and I darn well believe it. Literally any other brand would be a better experience.
5,Amazing keyboard! I bought this for my surface pro 3 works flawlessly. The keyboard keys are well-improved from the previous version. Track pad by far is the largest improvement. Now its glass and feels a lot smoother to use. Although not quite as good as Mac track pads but its getting closer. Probably one of the best typing and input experiences you can get on a windows device. Very comparable to the top ultra book keyboards. I would say its even better than the XPS 13 keyboard and track pad. Overall although a little pricy it is a must have for any surface owner and you are looking into getting a better typing experience with the older surface pro 3 it may be worth an upgrade.
1,Its not as described its a flat no key version that does not have the magnetic holder and does not even cover the screen and finally it does not even work !! -  I have returned its like a knockoff version that you can get very cheaply. Also the parcel arrived with inspected and restocked stickers on it so I'm probably not the first nor the last to send this keypad back. Its nothing like the Microsoft keyboard so be wary of the "Type Cover" wording.Update - I've since noticed there is a "Microsoft Surface Touch Cover Keyboard" which it looks like Amazon has sent to me in error as that is the keyboard that i was sent ($49)
5,Great product ! I would suggest for a slight sale as the cheapest I saw was ~ $115 CND but better than the third party keyboards hands down. The color is really nice too not as bright as the red or light blue versions.
5,shipping is super fast! great value for this great product. I first shopped an alternative keyboard. it turns out not so good. after comparing this one from Microsoft I think the one more hundred dollar is worthy considering I am a heavy keyboard user.

3,This keyboard is way overpriced for what it's offering.The keys are very slim (which some people might like). Therefore you don't feel like you're clicking on anything and gives a very unsatisfying experience.On top of that the mousepad is very bad. Sure it functions as you'd expect but the buttons are also touch sensitive. So when you want to click on something the mouse moves and you end up clicking on something else.Pros: Slim cool since is can snap to your tablet.Cons: Feels cheap bad mousepad and keys.
5,Purchased it for my husband for his new surface pro4
4,The keyboard even now looks very elegant but worth the money even if it is dearer than other available models. It worked perfectly fine till 16-18 months after that few intermittent glitches occurred. Keys like if zcvx 05< > () don't respond now-a-days particularly. It does not matter whether you are online-offline the key won't function properly.I checked with other surface pro device and the problem is still there. So that's sufficient to say that something is not right with the keyboard.
4,I like it because it is sturdy and works perfectly. The trackpad is one of the best in a windows laptop. the only downside is you have to keep it clean. as it attracts dust. one should place it in a clean surface . but according to the price it is not good.  as it is not even Bluetooth enabled or wireless. I would have loved it if it were wireless.
5,Make sure you read about the keyboard shortcuts. The magnets are quite strong. Doesn't mean you'll lift your surface with the keyboard though. the fabric will start wearing off over a period of time so you need to be very careful while handling your Surface. The key travel is should I say perfect for me at least backlight is great too.My only trouble with it is wiping it because of the fabric so just make sure you don't brush it against tables etc and you'll be good to go.
3,The edges of key board peels off and looks ugly.  # & @ buttons work inconsistently.  Not very good for money
5,A must have for all who own the surface pro 4. I dont know if I can call it value for money or not but still i would recommend it as it feels premium. It is very slim light weight typing feels better than the usual keyboard equipped with backlight and last but not the least it acts like a cover for the surface pro 4.
5,I have been using the key board  for about two weeks.It's an awesome product which enhances the surface pro productivity.I feel  thatMicrosoft  should bundle  it  with  everysurface  pro .Keys are comfortably placed..a nice touch pad.Good experience so far.
