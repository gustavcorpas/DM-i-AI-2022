5,The games I have played so far:The Outer WorldsValorantMarvel's Guardians of the GalaxyMultiversusFortniteEach game runs perfectly on the highest settings. The computer has NO problems with heat. Even with the more intense games it runs at about 60 C. I set it up with a 4k monitor and have had absolutely no problems. It definitely gives you the best bang for your buck for a prebuilt PC.
5,This thing is the embodiment of what I'd call a nerd's/geek's tank. I recently bought this as an upgrade from a PS4 (since I'm a firm believer that buying a console a PS5 for 1K sounded ridiculous in my eyes)  at the time so i figured to get more for my buck and get this beaut since it was on sale. What i can tell you so far there has been nothing wrong with it and I've been giving it torture since I've been playing. Two games i play is heavily modded fallout 4 and Arma 3 (creating huge battles). Arma 3 is understandably sometimes a little jittery from the huge number of AIs that are on the field but other than that it's performance is as smooth as your imaginary girlfriend's skin.Note: can't say much for customer support since I've never needed to.
3,Given the world we're living in graphics cards are exceptionally difficult to come by; which makes buying pre-builts all the more attractive. Now the computer arrived in fine shape. It boots. I can play Crysis. But the thing is they put some weird model janky Gigabyte 3090 into this thing. Again it works but by God it sounds like a jet engine if you just play Solitaire. Which is a real shame cause the CPU comes all hooked up to a fancy schmancy AIO hooked up to a 360mm rad. Which is a complete waste with this banshee sitting next to it shrieking its face off. This wouldn't be a huge problem because I planned on tinkering with cooling anyway. However it turns out this specific model isn't supported by any of the major water-cooling brands. EKWB? Nope. Corsair? Nuh uh. Alphacool??? Well according to this one Reddit post one of their coolers intended for a different configuration 3090 will work on this one. It also turns out you have to order the damn thing from Germany pay VAT pay $80+ for shipping. Yada yada. So I will get this thing watercooled come hell or highwater but it's going to cost a lot more and take much longer than I had hoped. When you spend $4200 + tax on a fine machine such as this you'd hope/think that watercooling the graphics card wouldn't be completely necessary. And if it is you'd hope there'd be a fairly common GPU model to make that easier. Guess I lost the lottery when the tech was picking out parts. Shame this is what it takes just to get any parts at all but that isn't Skytech's fault. Thank you for coming to my rant.
4,Its not a "Nasa" computer although you'll pretty much be able to play any type of game out there if you're having graphical or fps issues with games this computer will solve almost every problem you might have ran into with an older computer plus having a glass panel  and its ease of access is golden.
5,Basically plug and play excellent performance. It skimps a little on the ram but honestly for the price it makes absolute sense.
3,Pc is great other than it completely freezes frequently and has to be force shut down by hand to unfreeze. Beautiful to look at and other than that it runs great.
5,Okay heres a honest review Once i unboxed this Beauty and set her up i was excited and turned the tower on and all rgb lights worked fans worked except 1 fan which was because i rushed the mandatory lookover and what i mean is just like every other pre built you wanna check for any loose wires are unplugged plug ins in my case i followed the fan that was not working and noticed one of the wires were not fully pushed in place so after doing so and putting everything back together i powered her on and all fans were now working other than that this pc runs great and no problems at all even comes with a keyboard and mouse my expectations were met and im Glad to have purchased this product. TRULY RECOMMEND FOR GAMERS!!.
5,When I received this computer for my birthday I was super happy but I expected I'd have to install an additional cooling fan because I was led to believe (by other reviews) that this was needed. Since I'm old school and I used to build my own computers in the 90s this was no big deal. So I was totally delighted when my tower came with its own Cooler Master!! In addition all the other items were high quality and all the RGB worked like expected. The only draw back is that I received this computer before Win 12 came out and now I'll have the flash the BIOS on this one to get it up to speed to download so hopefully that'll go well when I decide to do that (It wont be for awhile).I've played Gensin Impact RDR The Witcher 3 and various Steam games on this PC and I've come across no problems. Running on high specs does not make the computer overheat at all and if you're worried about that just open the door and let that heat flow out. Overall I'm super happy and I'll be coming back for more computers in the future if needed.
1,I bought one thinking I’ll finally be able to play some newer pc games.  When it arrived the box was in good condition.  I opened the top and grabbed the box of accessories and opened that first.  Noticed that all the accessories were already opened and just thrown in the smaller box empty wrappers included.  Looked like someone stuffed it all back in and decided they didn’t want it anymore.  Next I pull out the pic itself.  Looks beautiful.  First thing I notice is there is a piece of tape on the glass panel that’s supposed to keep the door shut already cut.  I  took a closer look at the big box that it all arrived in and notice that there was a layer of tape underneath the sky tech company tape as if they originally taped it with clear tape but added their logo tape to hide the first layer of tape that had already been cut.  I continue to open the case and see that the GPU is slanted downward toward the side tha is not mounted. When I tried to shut the glass panel it was misaligned with the hole and I had to lift up on the glass to get it to close fully.  When I turn the Pc on I get black screen with green dots for a few seconds then it loads up into ordinary windows showing green dots a few more times during load up.  Computer tells me the GPU is experiencing error code 43. (Hardware damage).  Also compared the card that came with the computer certifying that it had been inspected with the only time stamp in the computers memory.  The cert was written nearly 3 weeks after the only time stamp on the computer.  So a totally bogus quality inspection.  Contacted customer support they tell me it must have been handled a little rough during shipping and they will get me a new one.  In up to 3 weeks.  They paid to ship it back and said they will put my new computer on expedited shipping after they receive my broken one and inspect it.  Not happy with how long it’s taking to get a new computer but if the replacement turns out well and shows up timely I may yet chalk it up to bad luck but until I get what I paid for and in the condition I paid for it (new and functioning) I’m gonna suggest building one yourself or just steering clear of skytech.  Update.  Called back about a week after they received my computer they verified they received it but told me that they couldn’t get to inspecting it until after all the other computers that came in before it.  I told them that I bought it brand new and it arrived broken and the guy on the phone tells me that it can’t be bumped ahead because they already have a lot of brand new factory broken PCs already ahead of it waiting to be inspected.  That’s not a good sign.  I told them to cancle the replacement and just refund me or I will get my bank involved.  They did but I still would absolutely not buy anything from sky tech again.  Terrible customer service and terrible quality product.
5,I didn't have my hopes up but just reading the specs I knew for the price some things wouldn't be top notch... Psu on the low end down a few fans CPU not one of the best in the business... But I must say after building my own and deciding to buy one out right I'm happy with this purchase.. I bought it in September and it's still rocking hard till this day... I didn't knits it had Bluetooth till recently lol... Overall good product so far...
5,Ive had for 2 months now and am amazed how well put  together it is all components are brand new inside all fans work and are NOT loud at all as some oe the posters say i think its the different model  im using the one with the rtx 3090 ... Will try and give a good update around 6 months
2,I don't know if they sold me a returned pc or I just got a dud. First windows wouldn't update but kept prompting me that it needed to be updated. Then noticed no nvidia drivers were installed.  When I tried to update nvidia drivers it would fail every time. Then I tried to update windows again thinking maybe thats why and that would fail. After a couple of attempts to update the computer it powered down. Turn it back on and now it's asking for a fresh install of windows. It back in the box and on a ups truck now. Its a shame cause I had purchased a skytech in the past and it was great so maybe it was just luck of the draw.
5,Performs excellent for all Games played on it thus far including new titles
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 When I first got it the package was torn up from the shipping. I know thats not the sellers fault and they ultimately can't control how its treated once it leaves. Thankfully they have cushioning on the inside that protected it very well. The PC was unaffected by it with no scratches or dings. The PC runs so good I'm in love. I'll update this later if I have any issues. I've been playing overwatch and the New World beta and it hasn't shown a single hint of issues.UPDATE: We are running up on her first birthday. Feels just like yesterday I entered the world of PC gaming.🥰 This PC has been so good to me. I still a year later havent had any issues. And thats even with me playing ark with like 30 mods.😂
5,My first venture into pc gaming and it’s fantastic it can run all my games at 60 fps like assassins creed and COD and it’s always able to do ultra graphics. Very powerful and very worth it.
5,I've been gaming on this computer for awhile and I don't have any complaints. It runs modern games at a reasonable frame rate and it didn't break the bank. The only thing I would say and it's not even a complaint is the computer is smaller than it looks in the photos.Still phenomenal
3,I just got it in the other week and noticed it came in with one of the bottom supports broken. I didn't care much at first but it's become a nuisance. Then a few days later I found out that one of the top USB ports also don't work. Great for gaming tho but I wish they would pay more attention the the product they ship out. It took me a long time to save up for this pc I wish it was in better condition.
5,.. Blazingly fast and an excellent value for the money. No problems whatsoever setting up the machine or installing Steam. I play a number of games through the portal and have suffered no issues at all.
5,Honestly great pc. Could've been a little more cheaper but it's good. When it arrived everything was packaged correctly and nothing was damaged. One thing tho is that it came with AMD Radeon GPU files on it so everytime I would start the pc up a bubble would pop up saying I don't have amd files installed. I just uninstalled the files and it was gone tho. Otherwise it's great and a very good pc
5,Pretty much plug-and-play.
2,It's to my surprise that even paying this much for a PC I still have to experiment with these problems. the most annoying of them all is that the top button to switch RGB on and off or to change the colors works when it wants to work! It's really frustrating since I didn't even want those lights to begin with. bought this for performance (because I use it as a designer for 3D modeling) and now I can't even get rid of the ugly lights. etc. and it takes forever to get/find and answer on the internet.
5,I can play any game
5,Just don’t like the 1tb duel would be better but easily remedied and I use it for gaming
4,The set up was a breeze.  It functions well.  I would give it five stars BUT documentation on-line cannot be found regarding buttons switches ports on the back/top etc.  I might still buy one again.
5,The graphics card is perfect for the average gamer. with the capabilities of the graphics card one can even mine a little cryptocurrency
1,This is my second time ordering A computer from them the first one didn’t turn on now the second one won’t turn on this is crazy. I thought it was a fluke for the first one but for the second one not to work they are just bad business from support to the way they package them they must be refurbished computers the box was all broken there’s a dent on the back side of the computer just horrible i will never buy a sky tech product again i learned my lesson the hard way
4,It's a great system so far but cooling is bit weak
1,Number one it took longer then usual number two it was damaged. it looked like it had been scraped with something sharp. Number 3 it would not power on. ive tried different cords different Plugins. everything was hooked it correctly. i then called customer service and was on hold for more then 40 minutes. terrible will not be buying from them again.
4,Great product for a good price although they sent a 500gb instead of a 1tb. However they’re sending in a 1tb so it’s not really that bad. Just have to wait so kinda inconvenient.
5,Amazing machine.  Exactly what I needed.
5,The PC arrived when they said it would. It preforms well. I would recommend this seller.
5,Beautiful machine quiet and my daughter loves the power for her gaming a YouTubing!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I thought my PC was the best system I have ever owned and I have been doing IT work for over 30 years.  Then came the day the Video Card Fan stopped working then the nightmare began.  If you get lucky and your Skytech system never has an issue then you will not be aware of the worthless customer service you will get from them.  I only owned my Skytech system for about 8 months and then the Vid card Fan failed.  Over the years I have talked with many IT support people from Dell Asus IBM to Gateway and then Skytech whom seem to not have a clue how IT support should work.  I would advise choosing any other brand.
4,Arived quick runs everything I need it to. Solid computer
4,cual es la actualización coorecta en este caso
5,2 months in no issues at all and runs iRacing at 184FPS which is a beast and keeps everything running smooth.
1,Pc we received did not work as there was no video. Per their instructions we sent back and have yet to get any sort of eta on when it will be replaced. Beyond frustrating as this was our son’s school pc he had been saving up for all year.
5,Works great right out of the box and easy to setup.
5,Great computer. Started right up no issues. Have been running a few weeks now. It’s quiet and stays cool. Runs everything I play on max graphics no problem. Would 100% buy again.
5,Easy set up and works great. My son loves it and uses it for gaming.
5,work game fun.....
5,Everything arrived super fast and it is a great value for the money.
5,Bought this for my son for his birthday it’s an excellent gaming computer. Great tech support and all around great company would definitely recommend
5,
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MOMEY WITH AMAZON FOR A PC!!
3,Box came with holes fingerprints were all over the inside packaging (looks used). For gaming it's been meeting expectations.
1,As soon as we took the computer out it didn’t work right. It was missing components and wouldn’t load any games. Called the computer support and they blamed STEAM. We took it in to have the proper systems installed and the repair place said it was the computer not STEAM. Two months later the whole computer crashed again. We had to have everything erased and put back on. One week later and it’s just a black screen. This thing is an expensive piece of junk!
1,I've been a long time customer of this Skytech and this is my 4th Computer from them overall I am still very happy with this company. I'd give them the usual 5star but the M.2 Hard Drive crapped out on this latest purchase after 3 months of usage which is kind of absurd considering the price tag on this beast.
2,I don’t know what it’s performance is yet since it’s a Christmas gift
1,After 2 days I booted up the Pc all for what just to see the monitor saying no signal. I tried the monitor with something else and it worked which meant there was a problem with the Pc Skytech told me to take the gpu and memory sticks out and back in still didn't work. I tried this multiple times but it didn't work so I had to return the PC.
1,The gaming card is nerfed
1,I write this review from a tech support queue that was only 10 people but I have been waiting in for over an hour. Out of the box something is wrong with the power supply and the computer will not turn on. Hopefully I will know more details about how quality control failed within an hour or so.
5,I curly purchase a CyberPowerPC - Gamer Supreme Gaming Desktop - AMD Ryzen 7 5700G - 16GB - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 - 1TB SSD - White I Highly recommend them. I havent had any issue with my NEW PC. I recommand it to a friend.
4,Good but a bit overpriced
5,Works as intended. Received with all components working case had 2 intake fans on the front 1 exhaust on the back and 2 exhaust fans connected to the radiator on top. Cpu had a AIO cooler. The hottest I saw the cpu get was 75c and the gpu got to a similar temp. I ran 3d mark benchmarks.No thermal throttling.No issues so far.Cpu: Ryzen 7 3700Gpu: 3060 12gb
5,This PC is fantastic Ryzen 7 3700x 3060 and 3200 MHZ ram with 16gb for $1799. was an amazing deal especially for this PC market atm. I managed to overclock everything in the system the ram to 3600 processor to 4.4 GHz and GPU up by 225 MHz and 1000 memory boost. The one thing I disliked about this system is airflow front panel has only one spot to go through and has one fan I did buy some extra fans with better pull rate and it was fantastic and temps dropped by 6°c
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I have this tower set up sans monitor specifically for use with virtual desktop.  Combined with a 5gb wifi router for wireless VR streaming to an Oculus 2 I am able to experience some of the most realistic gaming imaginable!  Keep all of the drivers updated and this unit will give you a tremendous amount of fun!
1,got the pc and everything seemed fine started to play games and found that the fps wasn't right started to work with there customer service team which was a nightmare for many different reason. every time you went to live chat there was some one new so where the old tech left off had to be explained to them all over again. the company was dishonest with me when they had me mail off my GPU saying they would send me a new one they just bench tested it and said ok it is good and sent it back with the same fps problems. got another new tech on the phone who wanted me to do all these different test then after I had emailed him back I never herd back from him. then the company took there live chat down because they were too busy so I had to call which was like waiting for some one from the government to pick up I was on hold with them for all most 2 hours before I selected for them to call me back. once I got some one the phone they said there was nothing they could do just send it in but after 2 months of dealing with the product being bad I wanted a new pc and tried to get a hold of the manger who refused to pick up the phone his reasons were it is not a good day for him to talk to customers. finally they got there lead tech to call me and he went threw a whole mess of testing and found that I do have some bad hardware and said that I would have to mail it in for repair but after thinking on this and how the manger was trying to intimated me with we will charge you a restocking fee I thought it best I send this product back and separate ties from this company.
5,Purchased for pure gaming and it hasn't disappointed once. Start up is quick no massive bloatware installed started gaming instantly (on max settings). Beautiful Machine!!!
5,So far so good.  Only had for 2 weeks now so still evaluating.
5,Really liking the PC so far easy to set up and get going. Has been working great for gaming with APEX legends battle field etc. will hopefully continue to perform well with next gen games have high hopes for it.
5,
5,Packaged came damaged but the PC itself was in perfect condition and thus far it runs very smoothly.
5,So far so good a lot for the money
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Has been using this for more than a week now I benchmarked almost all triple A games. So far nothing is wrong or bad did cyberpunk benchmarks was getting around 60-80fps. Not a single spike of lag or any problems at all. Would recommend if you gonna be buying this install 2 extra intake fans as you seen in the pics right there. The case isn’t the best for intake fans but as long as you got 3 in there honestly not bad at all. Will update review after 1 month. Fans could get a bit loud but don’t really bother me at all.And banh my approved the pc cause she always watch through the glass panel.
