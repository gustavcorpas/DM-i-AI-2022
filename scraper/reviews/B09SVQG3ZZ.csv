5,Got this laptop to take to school so I wouldn't have to take my Asus z g14. I was looking for something that wouldn't break the bank and something that is reasonable in price-to-spec ratio. For $300 this is no doubt the best laptop you could buy.Pros:- Comes in S mode but can easily be switched out(I've seen quite a bit of negative reviews about the laptop being in s mode and some individuals are unaware it can be removed. Instructions on how to switch out of s mode can be found on the Microsoft Support site)**- Runs off an m.2 sdd- Can add a 2.5" SSD or HDD (+1 Upgradability)- 4GB of ram is soldered onto the motherboard and there is an additional slot to add 1 ram module(+1 Upgradability)- Great specs for the price- Amazing for school light gaming and productivity- Very sturdy build quality- Has a fingerprint sensor- The fingerprint sensor unlocks the laptop very fast. In comparison to my other laptop(Asus z g14) the vivobook laptop reads my finger almost instantly- Backlit keyboard- Good keyboard that's satisfying to type on- Bright screen with nice colors- 720p webcam- Surprisingly good microphone for the price- The charger is small making it very portable- Very responsive trackpad- lightweightCons:- doesn’t charge by type c :(- In order to add a 2.5" SSD or HDD a SATA HDD FCC is not included(a bit inconvenient but for the price of the laptop I'm not complaining it's just worth noting)- Speaker sound quality isn't the best by default the format was at 24bit48000Hz(sounded like a tin can) I changed it to 16bit 192000Hz and it sounded a bit better- Battery life isn't the best- The air the fan produces kind of just flows through the laptop and isn't link physical linked to the CPU with a heat sink making it not as effective in cooling(this shouldn't really be a concern if you don't plan on running heavy software)Overall for the price of $300 you really can't go wrong this is an amazing laptop.
5,This laptop is top notch! It's no power house but it doesnt need to be (for me). Size and battery life for this laptop are my most important options and this device doesn't disappoint.The keyboard fits my typing style well and the keys feel great. The keys are not squishy nor clicky. They lean more stiff but not  clicky at all.  Comfortable come to mind.The backlit keyboard - white LEDs - really allows this keyboard to be used in low light conditions. I didnt expect a backlit keyboard at this sub-$300 price point. I'm very pleased with this device!The screen is very easy to read and brightness isn't an issue. I've not experienced glare with this screen either.I wouldn't attempt serious gaming with this device but cards and turn-based low-res games are probably ok.The OS (win 11 Home) loads incredibly fast with the M.2 drive which is another bonus at this price point.The only negatives I see are the minimum 4GB memory and the 128 GB M.2 drive. But these can be upgraded so are small issues.Overall I'm incredibly pleased with this laptop!
5,This is a nice laptop for the money. The first thing I did was upgrade the SSD and added a memory stick. So counting the upgrades I got a very snappy PC with plenty of room. I was out the door for well less than $350. I had to consider that most of my computer usage is surfing the web and email. Add some very light music production. For things like this and your basic office type documents this is a very capable computer. Windows 11 is actually pretty good too. Much better than 10. As long as it stays around the $300~$350 mark you won't go wrong. Very nice basic computer.
5,Initial reaction - expect a $300 laptop to do $300 laptop things. It's not powerful. It can run kind of slow simply because the specs of the hardware aren't great. Wouldn't recommend this for your main computer and you shouldn't expect to run any modern games on it.However my intention on buying this was to allow myself to have mobility to play my Xbox around the house without having to disconnect a bunch of wires. I can say that this laptop absolutely fills that need. In addition it seems like it would be great for some light office work or for a child to have for schoolwork. If you're looking for something to fill any of those needs you can't go wrong with this.
5,I love the size. It's exactly what I needed for my small business and personal needs. The fingerprint scanner is awesome and so convenient. My only complaint is that I didn't realize it didn't have a built in webcam. It makes it difficult for zoom or anything like that but I'm managing. I have not tried adding my own webcam extension at this time.
4,I bought this on Prime Day for $270. This laptop comes with 4 GB RAM soldered on board. It is very easy and inexpensive ($35) to add an 8 GB RAM module. With 12 GB of RAM this laptop runs noticeably faster and smoother.The SSD drive that came with this laptop is 128 GB and very slow. I upgraded the drive to a much faster WD 500 GB Gen3 drive for $45.So for $80 ($350 total) i upgraded this Vivobook to 12GB RAM and 500 GB SSD.The display in stock setting looks washed out. Changing the screen mode (in the MyASUS app) to Vivid (from Balanced) and increasing the brightness helps quite a bit. When you are running on battery the screen mode changes back to Balanced.
5,I purchased this laptop during recent Amazon prime day and have been very satisfied up to this point especially for the price and savings. It has more than met my expectations from easy setup all the way to battery life. The fingerprint security feature is definitely a plus. Almost sure my awesome purchase satisfaction will continue through usage.
4,It's overall good but battery life is kinda short compared to other laptops at similar (or a bit more expensive) price. Also the cpu is fine for regular works but I can't recommend it for playing games or some other graphical works. Audio quality is also not so good (but it doesn't really matter cause I use headphones). The biggest problem in my opinion is the heating. The laptop heats up fast.
4,Muy buen precio laptop moderna ideal para lo básico y tamaño ideal para llevarla a todos lados para estudiantes es muy buena. Recomiendo agregarle memoria RAM extra.
5,We have had this for about 6 weeks and so far so good. It seems like a really nice quality laptop.My son is able to play games on it too!He uses it daily for online streaming homeschool.I recommend it!
5,Good
4,I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase but since it was replacing a nine year old pentium laptop with the same memory and drive size that ran pretty well (when it powered on) I figured why not. I wasn’t disappointed. The I3 is quick. I’ve been using it for midi projects and it’s worked out better than I had hoped. I may still add more memory down the line but I really see no rush to do so.
4,Me agrado el precio y la comodidad de pagos
5,excelentes condiciones.
2,i got this on prime day for about $300 delivered and had a good feel for what i was buying a bit disappointed with overall performance and battery. first thing i did was upgrade ram with an 8GB stick for better performance then i tuned windows 11 for better performance with fewer visuals turned battery charge stopping point to 80% for longer battery life.  also i installed avast AV as i heard windows defender was causing performance issues - probably fixed by nowi really wanted windows 10 on this or at least win 11 pro i used a spare M2 drive with win 10 from another system that needed a bit of tweaking in BIOS to get it to run it ran hotter than win 11 not a lot from my testing but enough to cause concern - it wasnt a solid scientific test so if you want win 10 and have the knowledge means and license do it at own riskto access BIOS i think it was hold the F1 or maybe F2 before pressing power - this wasnt intuitive and most people have no reason to do thiscons: windows 11| CPU runs hot but you wont know unless you install software for that or check bios | fan runs a lot so battery life takes a hit | screen will sometimes shift in color/brightness for no reason - min is set to 100% native resolution | wall wart charger | location of power switch/power light | battery life with 80% charge is about 3 hours light duty | USB-C port is pretty useless as it doesnt work with some pretty universal port replicatorspros: price | better than average keyboard for price | fingerprint reader works fairly well | bright screen | light weight | 3 USB A ports & USB-C port | not uglyfinal thoughts: get this if you can keep it plugged or dont mind charging often - most would be better served with a chromebook.  i regret not buying laptop w a ryzen CPU.  because of heat im pretty sure this wont last more than 2 years for most
5,This extremely small and beautiful Laptop is extremely fast and very much worth the price. Thank you to Amazon and the Seller for this sale to South Africa and for all the other Asus Laptops and Asus Routers.Thank you.Mark Mahaffy
2,I bought something with limited use
1,This laptop comes with Microsoft Edge installed which is junk and it has “S Mode” enabled on it which inhibits the user from installing any software Microsoft hasn’t “verified”It gives you directions on how to turn off S Mode which leads you to a page in the Microsoft store that is nonfunctional.Microsoft has made it so you’re not able to use software products that aren’t theirs and has made it so you’re unable to turn off the restrictions. Absolute joke.
1,This is the most unresponsive slowest computer I have ever seen. It BARELY functions out of the box. It can’t keep up with typing in an email address it cannot stream any service tried (Netflix Hulu Disney+). The delay is infuriated and this was a total and complete waste of money. DO NOT BUY.
1,Started malfunctioning right out of the box. Returned.
4,This laptop is a no fluff basic computer that doesn’t have a ton of storage and isn’t super fast but it is perfect for doing school work and streaming tv and movies. If you are a big gamer this probably is not the #1 choice but I just wanted something that was easy to use and I could do work on and watch Netflix. This has been great so far and is lightweight and has a decent sized screen. It’s a great option for college for writing papers. Windows 10 runs smoothly and it’s great for just browsing the web. Overall a good basic laptop and a great price!
5,This review is for the ASUS VivoBook 14 F415 Laptop Computer. It has a 14” FHD Display Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor 4GB DDR4 128GB PCIe SSD and a Fingerprint Reader. You get the laptop itself and a charger in here not much more. This laptop only has 4 GB of ram and uses a Tiger Lake mobile cpu. It does come with built in UHD graphics so it will run some games for you however do not expect it to run anything demanding. If you want to play Minecraft Roblox or Runescape - this will do it with no real issues.This computer comes with Windows 10 version S. This prevents you from installing any apps or programs that are not contained on the Windows App store. This special Windows mode is made to help lower end laptops such as this run Windows 10 without an issue. However the specs of this are plenty to run regular Windows 10 so I went ahead and disabled S mode which allowed me to run whatever programs I wanted on here. I have not had any issues with it running too slowly yet.I have personally been using this laptop to run my laser engraver and it has done a fantastic job at that. It is able to do the image editing I need as well as run LaserGRBL and Lightburn. I am also using this as a car computer as it is just the right size. I have a tuning program on it for my Honda and am able to tune the car in real time this lap top is wonderful.Overall I am very happy with how this has been working so far. The screen is small which was a desired feature for me as it helps a lot with battery life and portability. I would absolutely get this computer again as I find it has a great value to it.
4,In terms of functionality it works very well and is capable my only qualm is the screen which changes color at every shift and feels fake so just beware if you are doing visual work
5,I deploy and setup a lot of computers for my work as I work as a consultant for small businesses taking care of their IT needs. The case is okay nothing to really write about it's functional and mostly plastic so that helps to keep the cost down in the manufacturing. I do like the layout of the components on the mainboard they placed the fan on the right side of the unit and then created an air channel by making track which guides the airflow across the CPU over the heat pipe and then exiting the laptop by passing through the heat sink fins. The CPU is placed over the keyboard area and not the palm rest portions of the laptop. This keeps your palms from heating up and sweating during the warm summer and fall months. Dell and HP uses to place the CPU underneath the palm rest area to keep the heat away from the  other components of the laptop but ergonomically it wasn't a good idea. The M.2 NVMe card could have been replaced with an 22x42 card instead of 22x80 and placed inside the track of the airflow for better cooling.The laptop cover is easy to remove just 10 screws to remove and you can use a plastic gift card or your nails to separate the bottom cover from the base of the laptop. A normal credit card is too thick to slide in-between to start separating the cover from the laptop.What I like about the laptop:1. Memory is upgradeable the response for ASUS is 16GB I'm assuming one 16GB DDR4 2RX8 SODIMM upgrade. I upgraded the memory from 4GB base to 12GB using a single 8GB DDR4 SODIMM 32002. M.2 NVMe drive is upgradeable no mention of the maximum size but I'm guessing no one would put more than 2TB drive because any larger size drive would cost more than the entire laptop which is $350 for the 128GB SSD and 4GB DDR4 memory3. Good layout for heat transfer4. i3 processor is better than the Celeron N series from Intel but the AMD Ryzen would provide better performance for price per dollarWhat I think could be improved:1. The 4GB option shouldn't even be offered with Windows 11 as the computer runs dog slow with only 4GB on Windows 11 even in S mode2. The blank slot were another 2.5 inch SSD could be installed or additional battery was left without any connectors. So even though it has the drive bay no connectors means you cannot easily upgrade the disk.3. No TF/microSD card slot included the disk drive being small at only 128GB on this model an TF/microSD card slot would be useful to store files music or movies but none was included4. Refresh rate of the screen is only 60Hz so no gaming and the screen is only medium brightness 140 nitsThe laptop comes setup with Windows S mode by default which is good for younger kids so you can give them the laptop without worrying about them downloading and infecting the computer with malware or viruses. The downside with S mode is the laptop cannot be used for most business applications because typically you need to install some software that not in the Microsoft store like anti-malware from Malwarebytes or games or business software the Microsoft ecosystem is too small and limited to for a general use computer unless for kids or students or you want to connect this to a HD TV screen to watch movies but there are many more better options than using a laptop for this.
5,This ASUS VivoBook 14 F415 Laptop works perfectly for what I got it for! I wanted something inexpensive but still usable for my 10 year old I mean if I wanted to keep him off my $3000 XPS then he needed something of his own. Basically I got this for him to practice typing of course doing other things like playing Minecraft…lol.Anyways I wasn’t really expecting much I mean it’s $350 laptop so I figured it would be a lot the quality of the school issued chrome books that they give the kids during the school year. But it’s much better than that! This is basically a full blown laptop and not a cheap little chrome book! The screen is actually quite good for the price it’s clear and easy on the eyes no it’s not going to compare to your HD tv but it’s still a good screen. This laptop is actually pretty quick too things load much faster than I anticipated and we have not had any issues there at all. As far as battery my son can get a good 4-5 hours of Utube videos out of this (not all in one go I promise!) before it needs charged. I think that’s pretty great. It’s also pretty light weight yet feels solid and durable.Overall I’m totally happy with this. Its definitely way better than I expected at the price point you really don’t have to spend an arm and a leg these days for a solid and well functioning laptop it seams: highly recommend!
5,This is all you need for basic web surfing work or school. I like how quickly you can access it with the touch of the fingerprint sensor. The keys seems small while typing but good enough to use and enjoy. The backlit keyboard can easily be adjusted with a few brightness levels to choose from. It's compact feels light and slim. It runs smooth! I wouldn't try any gaming on this one in particular but it's a great laptop overall for general use.
5,This is a decent basic little laptop. Perfect for student use and other typically daily tasks. Not for hard-core gaming or photo editing stuff like that. For basic surfing web use streaming  it is a good choice. Easy to get set up and straight into use so you don't need to be a computer whiz to use this - which makes it good for younger kids as well as individuals who are not so computer savvy. Overall not bad. Don't expect a work horse and you'll be happy with it I think. It is basic yet efficient.
5,This is a good value laptop.  Great for students kids grandparents travel web surfing etc.Quick points:  • No touch screen but then it was not advertised as having one.  • Screen is decent not super-charged but definitely adequate.  • My unit was fast and responsive.  Considering its price-point no issue with the speed or capability.  • It is pretty light at 3 pounds 3 oz (1.4kg).  • The power cord power supply is small which is great for travel/carrying in a backpack.This unit come with Windows 11-S which is “Safe” mode.  This basically means you cannot install any software that is not in the Windows store.  This supposedly limits people from loading “bad” software.  However it is very easy to get out of safe mode I did it in about 30 seconds and it easy to find how on the internet.My unit came with 128G (SSD) hard drive which gives you 117G of actual space.  This is not very big but then I didn’t need to install or store too much.  Win11 takes up about 30G of the hard drive so you have about 87G left.
5,Super easy to start beautiful presentation of box and products. It’s super light and meets 100% of its characteristics. It's very fast and super fast charging I love it.
