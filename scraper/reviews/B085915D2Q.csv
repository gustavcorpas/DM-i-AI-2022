5,After a very thorough amount of research and due diligence I purchased this backpack for international air travel with hope it would replace a bulky carry-on suitcase.  My expectations were exceeded and this bag is the best backpack available.  I've used it daily for six weeks and if for whatever reason it were to spontaneously combust on my back I would still reorder it.This bag is expertly designed.  Tremendously useful pockets pocket placement and pocket access.  Due to the number of pockets and the way the backpack opens the amount of stuff this bag holds is incredible.  I was able to fit a laptop iPad two phones over-ear headphones charging cables a bag of my toiletries keys 18oz water bottle wallet passport notebook novel a pair of flats and a change of clothes into this bag.  And even packed this substantially it was still wearable.  While it's most comfortable when it's not packed to 20 lbs the padded straps still offer support at this heavier weight.  The bag fits easily under most airplane seats and the luggage strap also works very effectively if you are carrying additional luggage.I was so impressed with this backpack for travel it just became my day bag.  I take it to work; I use it for errands and groceries and I even sleep with it (that last part isn't true).  Look no further for the best backpack.  Just order!
5,I'm a college professor and I bike to work.  I've been searching for the perfect backpack for years.  This is what I've been looking for.Why I love it:1.  Professional looking (I got the dark grey with black)2.  Comfortable (straps and back have decent padding)3.  Perfect number of organizers and pockets for me:--  front pockets for my phone keycard Airtag masks-- main pocket has pouch for file folders (grading) and my iPad Air as well as space for my lunch a sweater my webcam and anything else I need for the day--two side pouches one for my water bottle and one for my Overnight Oats bottle4.  The "doctor bag" frame keeps it open while you are packing and unpacking it.  I've never seen this before on a backpack and it's genius.I love this bag.  I have bought and returned several others with much higher price tags before finding this one.  I almost kept the Peak Design (I do love Peak Design) but the lack of water bottle holders killed it for me.I hope this helps you in your decision!
5,Stylish and functional. I'm a middle school teacher and I've used a lot of different totes and bags throughout the years. This one is the best by far! It has excellent pockets a luggage strap high quality zippers and roomy water bottle pockets with elastic to keep it in place.I would take this on a trip as a carry on but mainly I use it to carry my laptop and 3 notebooks to and from work every day. I carry all my essentials like wallet jets sunglasses chapstick lotion pens & pencils highlighters sticky notes you name it!My one complaint is the tablet sleeve will only fit my iPad if I take the case off. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning. It's a SMALL tablet pocket.I ordered the green and black. I was worried about the satin sheen look but it's actually very nice and durable. I love the color and style and it has a nice striped lining too. I'm looking forward to having this bag for a long time!
5,There's a reason this bag has such good reviews. I needed a new laptop bag for a work conference. I remembered reading a few years ago that Hap Tim was a good bag for a lot of different uses. When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised at the size. I kept worrying that I was going to run out of room but it fit all of my printouts/documents and my personal and work laptops.My single complaint is that the water bottle pocket on the side could be deeper or more secure. My water bottle kept falling out every once in a while when moving between sessions/meetings. Other than that it's a gorgeous back with plenty of space and is comfortable to wear.
5,I bought this to use as my personal item bag on a trip to Italy. It has a lot of storage space and the pockets were perfect for easy access when I needed to get to something quickly. It’s also helpful that the inside lining is light colored so I could easily find things. The zippers are nice and smooth and I love that it has a luggage trolley strap in addition to backpack straps.
5,I use this as my teacher backpack and I am able to fit everything I need in here and more!  It is incredibly sturdy and opens up nicely to view everything that is inside with ease instead of having to dig around to find things.  I love the color options and have recommended it to several teacher friends and co-workers who have been looking for something just like this!
5,This is a perfect bag for school I use it to hold my laptop cables notebooks. The pockets are perfect for easy access and storage. I love the wide open zipper top so easy to see all the way to the bottom. This has been the best school purchase. Highly recommend!
5,I have been using this backpack for work for a few months now and love it. I mostly love how the compartments inside for the laptop and tablets are so padded. I use my laptop a lot for work and love that it feels secure in the pocket. I also have a iPad coming soon and so I am happy that the pocket in front of the computer pocket will work well for it.I also love that the straps are padded and this makes a huge difference for me because as a former student who carried lots of files books and papers in addition to my laptop I know how much weight can press on your shoulders. I carry a lot of files and my laptop for work so I appreciate the good padding on the straps. I also love that it is waterproof. I will be using this backpack for travel in the future cause I can tell it will be sturdy and roomy enough for all my things especially for shorter domestic trips.
5,The reviews were spot on and the videos helped so much.  This is exactly what I was hoping to find and such a great price!  I carry a water bottle in the side pocket-it does not fall out.  So roomy inside it’s hard to believe what can fit in there!
5,After searching for tons of laptop bags for women I finally pulled the trigger and order this. No regrets at all! It protects my laptop nicely and fits a lot of stuff without looking bulky. It looks expensive too.
5,Very durable I have the gray and my husband has the black one.  They have lots of pockets  a place to carry a laptop on the inside with a velcro closure pockets on outside to carry water bottles.  Love how versatile they are.  Great for travel
5,I absolutely love this backpack! It fits a ton of books and folders and has plenty of pockets. The wire frame opening makes everything inside so much more accessible. I have been using it daily for a few months and it still looks great and is holding up well.
5,I love this bag I use it for work I can take it in the thing and throw it in there I like the pockets and the different compartments this is a very good work backpack especially when you work in the medical field.
5,Excelente la capacidad que tiene para llevar todo lo que se necesita en un viaje corto. Es cómodo de llevar y resistente. Me funciono en estas vacaciones por lo que superó mis expectativas.
5,Really nice looking back pack. Couldn’t believe how much it holds. Used it as my personal item on plane. Held my purse tablet phone toiletries two pair leggings & two tops & hoodie. Fix great under my seat on Delta
5,This is a great backpack. It looks good and professional. I don't feel like I look like a child carrying my stuff into work. I bought the green one and I really like that it is just a little different than the traditional black or blue that usually signals professional attire but I'm going to probably buy the blue or black one as well for more formal meetings.As far as functionality goes it is great. The top opening bag is wonderful and you can pack so much stuff it is really amazing. It is also so nice to have side pockets in the main compartment which a lot of backpacks don't offer and you suffer without a way to organize.I know what people are saying about the pack falling over from the weight in front pockets but I really like the many pockets on the front again to help with organize. I also like the look of this backpacks front pockets. Some similar backpacks have boxy looking fronts or are wasting space by only having a lower pocket. I just lay the backpack in a kind of reclining position when I sit it down and it balances pretty well.I really feel like when I'm wearing it the load is balanced well and it is snug but very comfortable on my back. I have disc problems in my neck and my shoulder can act up. It has been "triggered" by some other backpacks that I have tried usually because they are slouchy and the load hangs and pulls. This pack has good structure that prevents that and I find it very comfortable. I'm a 55 year old 5'3" female.If I could say one sort of a hoped improvement it would only be that I would be very willing to pay 50 60 or even 80 bucks for the same design that had a bit better quality. Not that the quality is really lacking especially for the price - honestly this is a steal but I have had one snap break and would pay more for a pack that has better quality. However I can't say that I am not pleased in any way. This is a great backpack. I'm going to show my daughter when she comes home from college and encourage her to get one.Thanks for making a great product!
5,I recently traveled to California and needed a personal bag. TSA approved personal bag. i've received many compliments on the bag. Very spacious i was able to fit quite enough stuff that didn't fit in my carry on. You can only tell its green depending on the lighting but i had no problem with the color of the bag It neutral and good enough for me.
5,I always have so much to carry as a teacher and this is the backpack for me. There are so many pockets and the opening is wide enough that it’s easy for me to find things. I am in love with the comfortability look pockets and overall design of this backpack.
5,This is a great bag...deep holds a lot of items can store under the seat on a flight. Tons of compartments. Love it.
5,My daughter needed a new backpack and wanted something that looks mature stylish and classy (she got the dark grey). And it does. It's really pretty and so far has been durable for all of her heavy books.
5,I liked it so much as did my co-workers we order 88 of them as gifts for our staff!!!  The large opening is great to find things my 15 inch laptop fits perfect and there are lots of pockets!!
5,Love! A back back that stands up nicely by itself roomy but not too big water resistant plenty of pockets but I’m not losing my stuff and cute. I was excited for it to arrive but my expectations have been exceeded.
5,I work from home and because of that I take advantage of my free time by traveling and working from hotels often. I've been on the hunt for a bag that can hold my laptop and my extra screen. As much as I love and need my extra screen it's a bit large/bulky. It needed to be a backpack that has a luggage strap.This bag seems to be just what I needed. Both my screen and my laptop can fit in the laptop sleeve. I can fit my keyboard planner and a book with plenty of room to spare for miscellanous travel items. The shape is great when it zips up it slims down. It's as close to perfect as I think I can get at this price point. Hopefully it's also durable!A decent sized water bottle can fit on each side. The last one I tried that was similar shaped to this one couldn't fit a water bottle in the side pocket once it was full.There are a lot of pockets in the front that seem useful.I haven't had a chance to use it yet but I will in a couple of weeks and will report back if it doesn't hold up well.
5,I bought this backpack for a week long trip that I took to California. I did not want to check my luggage as I had a connecting flight. This backpack was easy to pack (it opens at the top and stays open while you pack it). It then zippers shut. It has will thought out compartments for a laptop and items I wanted to be able to retrieve quickly. It fit securely on my carry on suitcase. Once on the plane it fit easily under the seat! I am unsure of its durability as I just purchased it; however it appears well made. Highly recommended!
5,This bag is so cute!!! It is very spacious inside & seems to be well made. The green color is a nice neutral color & I love the black with it. Very happy with this purchase & would totally recommend it!!
5,Works great. Very spacious. I use this for work travel and it is wonderful! I have received several compliments on it at the airport.
4,I ordered the green/black. The green is not an obvious green like in the picture. It’s more gray which was pretty disappointing. I was looking forward to the green color in the pictures. Might exchange for a different color. The quality is good. I like the overall bag!
5,I used this as a carry on.  It has so many useful pockets and the way it opens up is handy for packing. Lots of room. I love it!
5,Bought this for a long flight and Alaska cruise. It worked great. It’s now my daily work bag. It holds my laptop has tons of space and great pockets. It is comfortable to carry and it stands up on its own when the top is open. Can’t recommend this bag enough!! Just buy it.
5,I bought this backpack to use at a music camp with my kids.  I had to carry everything for myself and my two kids for the day and this backpack was perfect.  It has a ton of pockets which helped keep everything organized.  I was able to carry all of their music books my iPad two water bottles my coffee cup a couple of notebooks snacks chargers and a knitting project and there was plenty of room for more stuff.  It also looks great and I could use it in a more professional situation if I needed to.  I have only used it for one week so I can’t comment on durability long term but it seems to be in great shape after a week of constant heavy use.
5,Cute functional and good quality
5,I love this bag! I need to bring home items from work daily…this bag allows me to easily move items from home to work.  Best of all it doesn’t hurt my back.
4,Love the backpack itself for hauling my laptop and gym clothes around campus. It’s sharp-looking but the green is most definitely gray- FYI. I would still recommend.
5,I love that this bag has a metal rod on the top by the zippers to hold it open when I’m trying to put stuff in or find something inside.  All the pockets are perfect size and my laptop and tablet fit perfectly in the back sleeves.  I also like how it has a luggage strap on the back so it can fit on the handle of my suitcase for traveling. Great bag!  10/10
5,I bought this backpack for travel.  After an hour or more of looking I chose the Hap Tim because it seemed to have the roomiest interior for packing extra clothing and shoes.  It came today and it didn't disappoint.  Besides the open center area there are several other zipper compartments and many pockets to keep things organized.  I won't be taking my 17" iPad this trip but it will fit nicely for another trip.  At this point I can't attest to durability or how waterproof the backpack may be but it seems well made and I think it could shed at least some rain.
5,I loved this backpack  especially traveling on several connecting flights.  I loved the shoulder straps-very comfortable and wide. The main compartment is  spacious and you  can add pack clothes toiletries small purse and laptop or ipad devices.This backpack is the perfect and comfortable for petite woman traveling on the go in unexpected weather conditions.  This is my 1st waterproof backpack. Loving it!
5,At first I thought it was going to be too small but it's perfect for traveling.  Holds a lot much than expected.
5,The roominess
5,Love this bag. Lots is storage. Great for school work or traveling. Water repellent. Comfortable to carry even when stuffed full.
4,I was so excited about this backpack because of the style and the large capacity. I’ve had the bag since Monday and the strap already broke today (Wednesday). I’m so sad because I really love this backpack but need a bag that is more durable I can hold my work binder & papers. Giving four stars because the bag as a whole is great the durability in the straps needs to be improved.
5,I absolutely love this back pack it easy to travel with and stores alot
5,This backpack is great. Roomy with lots of pockets. Very functional. I bought it for a recent trip and loved using it. Unfortunately on the third day the snap that holds the loops at the top broke. It's a little leather strap and the snap fastener broke. Would love to get it fixed or replaced.
5,This is a great backpack I was hesitant and not sure if it was what I needed but it is great! There are enough pockets to stay organized but still fit a decent amount of things in there. I use for work and fit a lot in here (laptop purse gym clothes book notes snacks) and still have room. The material and zippers seem to be durable and of good quality. I have not travelled with this one yet but I am confident it would work very well especially for a short single bag trip OR if you just need easy laptop storage. Very happy!
4,The outside zipper broke but other than that it was a good size to bring on a plane and store all my electronics etc. in it and was not too bulky for a 60 year old lady to carry.
5,I’ve been on the hunt for a travel backpack with large water bottle pockets and I returned 2 different ones and finally found this one! This is a great travel backpack. It’s super cute too!
5,Very durable easy to clean. Kept the laptop safe and dry. Worth the buy.
5,My daughter got this backpack in 7th grade and is still using it as she is going into 11th. she loves this backpack and uses it for everything! any stains come out good with spot treatment we have put it in the washer before and it came out fine. there is so much storage and plenty of extra room after you have all the school stuff in. I totally recommend it to anyone in the market for a durable and long-lasting backpack. she got the blue-gray.
4,This bag has a lot of room and numerous pockets to organize your items. I used it to travel abroad and it was a great carry on. The opening is wide and it's easy to pack/unpack items. I like that the handles can be buttoned together so that the zipped portion is harder to open. I wish the fabric was different but I think for the price point it works.
5,Great backpack! Sturdy and roomy
5,It has the right amount of storage and size for work items!
5,Purchased this for traveling around Europe for 5 weeks. LOVED it! The fabric is strong no marks on my bag. The multiple pockets were incredibly helpful to stay organized. The strap on the back to attach to my luggage handle was a godsend saved my back. And I love how the main compartment can stay open and has the 2 handles for the option to carry it.This survived planes trains busses cabs stairs and lots of cobblestone streets! 100% recommend!
5,I love this backpack it stands upright and does not sag when you are searching for items. Lots of pockets and room for laptop. The side water bottle holder is just the right size for my hydro flask.
5,Used the backpack for travel on my trip - it fit perfectly. The backpack has plenty of room and "compartments". Really like the color as well.
5,Very nice backup perfect for traveling on the airplane
5,I love this bag. It has great storage and is very durable plus cute! Highly recommend!
5,Used as a laptop bag and a travel bag. Big pockets means easy access.
5,This backpack is great for daily commute in NYC. I’m a massage therapist has room for change of clothes umbrella water bottle coffee and lunch. Don’t have to worry when it rains. It is a bit on the large side of a backpack but it squishes flat! Very good buy. Would recommend to fit a ton of stuff
5,I really like the durability of this backpack.  First the laptop sleeve is padded and keeps my laptop safe during travel.  The other pockets are perfect for notebooks wallet my glasses pens etc.  The charging bank portal is fun for charging my phone with my portable charger.  All in all very happy with this purchase. Professional and fun.
5,Love it plenty of space. VERY stain resistant. I've dumped my coffee on it on several ocassions and coffee wipes right off. Very light weight and extremely practical.
5,Very light weight and roomy
5,I rarely write reviews but this bag is awesome.  I took it with me for a 1.5 week international travel.  Great on the plane & fir car trips. It’s the perfect size and holds so much! It’s also comfortable and made well.  In can’t recommend it enough.
5,Perfect travel bag or for every day. I went long haul with this bag as my carry-on. It opens up so wide you can get a lot in there. Lots of great inside & outside pockets. And it looks super high-end. Received compliments. Super sturdy. Now I use it for my every-day backpack for work. Love it!
5,Love this backpack! Light enough room & compartments including for a water bottle and umbrella - and stylish as well. It fit nicely under the airplane seat and didn’t dig into my shoulders when walking “miles” through the airport. Highly recommend.
5,I used this on an international flight.  I loaded this bag full and it still fit under the seat.  The best part was when I wanted something out of the bag I was able to zip open the bag and it stood upright which made for easy retrieval of wanted items.  It was also more stylish than a stand backpack/daypack but just as sturdy.  The only drawback was the zipper compartments on the front could not be secured like some travel purses I own.  I solved the problem by sewing a cloth pencil bag inside the main compartment for securing my travel documents.
5,Of all the backpacks that I have owned this is my favorite! It's big enough to carry what I need to take to work  but not too big. I can fit my art supplies lunch tablet crossbody bag glasses masks 22 Oz water bottle charging supplies toothbrush and a few toiletries. I am a seamstressso I also carry my current sewing project with me which is usually a really full skirted dress.  haven't traveled with it but I feel like it's great for that as well. I have already ordered another one.
5,Seriously obsessed with this bag. We bought it for a trip but honestly I might switch it for our regular diaper bag. So many pockets cute color durable and lots of storage. I’ve already recommended this bag to lots of people.
5,I've used this backpack for weekend trips and as a bag to commute back and forth from the office. I have received many compliments on this bag. I can fit my laptop as well as multiple binders comfortably. The separate pockets in varying sizes are perfect. I wish I had a bag like this when I was lugging around a diaper bag. I have had this on while walking in the rain and it seemed to repel the water great. Comfortable straps and durable fabric! Great value for the money and a professional looking bag. I purchased the green and black bag and the color is exactly as pictured.
5,I bought this backpack for a trip and am so glad I did. I research everything (it drives my husband nuts) and landed on this one because of some glowing reviews and the number of pockets and sleeves it had. It was also nice looking which is a plus. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to a friend (in fact I did during my trip). The main compartment is very roomy and has two padded sleeves on one side perfect for a small laptop or iPad. The other side has an unpadded sleeve perfect for magazines books drawing pads etc. The center of the main compartment between the sleeves is very roomy - I could fit a lot in there. The outside has several pockets - a small one at the top perfect for keys mints etc. There's a large flat front pocket with a snap button that makes it easy to get into quickly (great for a pack of sanitizer wipes and a mask while traveling) and the larger pocket on the front has a good amount of space for stuff plus two mesh pockets to secure your phone or whatever you want there. The only problem I had is remembering which pocket I'd put something because of the many options :)
5,Great quality for the price. I got it for when I start grad school in the fall and I can tell it’s going to last. Just used it for an overnight trip to visit family and it fit everything I needed to bring plus had room for more. Overall I am very happy.
5,Worth it . Good Quality
5,Perfect for plane travel. Fits easily under the seat. Plenty of pockets.  Love that it opens at the top rather than a traditional backpack especially on a plane.  Recommend highly!!!
4,I ordered the green and black bag during the prime day sale. That bag is great and I love it the only reason I’m giving it four stars is because of the color. The green part of my bag actually looks more light grey to me instead of green.
5,I have been looking for the right diaper travel bag for a while now. Really glad I came across this one. It has several well placed pockets a great large compartment laptop pocket tablet pocket and a luggage strap along the back (this was a must for me). I can’t wait to use it on our big international trip coming up!
5,Fantastic bag.  Love the wide opening.  Lots of compartments.  Durable fabric
5,After only 1 week of ownership I can already tell this is the perfect work bag for me. Very roomy but not too bulky. Easy access top pocket and big side bottle holder make this a great bag. My laptop and files fit easily in the padded inner pocket with room for the power cord and accessories. Give it a try - you won’t regret it.
5,This bag was one of the best purchases I made for my wife. She fits a some of her case files as well as her laptop and charger in the main part.there’s plenty of room for more. She can also fit charging cables for her phone as well as headphones pens etc. in all of the little nooks and cranny pockets that this bag comes with. Super durable as she took it in the rain and nothing was ruined or messed up not even through the zipper part -and the rain was coming down pretty hard. This bag was overall great it’s got a lot of room plus it’s really light weight as she has multiple sclerosis so she’s not able to carry as much weight on her back.
5,Backpack is super cute and great for travel. The strap in the back helps it slide over a carry-on very easily. It has lots of pockets and places to put things good zippers. The only complaint I would have is that the zipper at the top needs two hands to zip and unzip it; it can’t be done with one hand. But this is by no means a dealbreaker.  It’s great for my laptop and other things that I want to bring. I used it for travel and it was excellent.
5,Plenty of space in the main pocket. I used it for traveling and it was the perfect size for a carry on. Now I use it for work and it works perfect.
4,Haven’t used this backpack yet! Want to use it for travel and I love all the space and compartments! A place for everything! Very lightweight as well!
5,This is probably my favorite Amazon purchase EVER. It’s a great bag looks nice lends itself to organization and is great for travel. This is the best backpack I have ever owned. My husband likes mine so much he bought one too.
4,I love this for traveling. My only complaint is the large zipper in the front- it opens all the way down so the flap comes down- which some may like- but it is a risk of items falling out during access while traveling.
5,The features and look of this bag are perfect. I was disappointed that the green color I ordered was more silver looking and therefore not as feminine as I expected. The light weight and generous pocket sizes plus the well organized interior space and strap to hold it on a luggage handle make it my new favorite "personal item" for travel.Customer service was phenomenal I reached out about the color and had a reply and resolution within hours. Very impressive it makes me want to purchase from this company again.
5,This is a great backpack.  It stands up which is very nice.  Has a large opening which makes it easy to pack.  Love the double drink holders.  There are lots of pockets to store various items.
5,I was looking for a daily bag that I could take to work and my girls dance and volleyball and this bag is perfect! Tons of room without being bulky and sturdy!
4,Strap broke after one trip out of town  mostly on my back really handled well.But it snapped off one day and split and now I can not tighten the strap .Aka hints for this comment -Other than that great Bag… hoped it lasted longer than a month
5,Works as I wanted it to
5,Fits a ton and is very comfortable to wear. Wish they had versions in all Black and all Olive Green.
5,I plan to use it while traveling
5,I love the affordability and space! I'm currently using it as a teacher bag. Fits everything I need to bring with me daily and more!
5,Was looking for a basic backpack to travel with and am very pleased with this one. There are plenty of pockets storage places large main section. The size is standard but not oversized which I like. Would buy again.
5,Love this backpack! Lots of compartments. Perfect for a laptop and can fit paperwork and a 2nd laptop. Very happy with this product!
5,Hold everything I need for work.LaptopMultiple note padsChargerAnd more!
5,I love the way the largest compartment opens! Plenty of space and pockets! Strong but still lightweight!
5,Great space for all of your needs like a special area for your computer. It is sturdy and has shape so it sits up and stays stable when you set it down.. no digging and searching for items.. excellent product.. just returned from Europe and used this bag. Loved it
4,This backpack is nice for the most part. It definitely needs another zipper for each zipper compartment so you can open from either side.  When it gets heavy it loses its shape a little.  Overall it is nice and I would recommend.
5,Not that I needed another backpack but after hearing about this bag so glad I purchased it! Lots of pockets for organization and I love the wide opening for the main compartmemt. I do wish the zippers had 2 way zipping. Inside lining is a little noisy when you are digging through it in the middle of the night and trying not to make any noise. The laptop pocket holds my iPad my laptop and my work tablet which is good because the smaller pocket is too small for my iPad. Even with these nitpicks I love this backpack.
5,I was thinking I may not like the "green" thought it may be a little to "mint".... nope it's beautiful!!  More of a sage green. The inside striped pattern is so nice too!  I love the color love the design and would totally buy this again  The wide top is perfect for access.  It holds my Macbook (very nice the pocket is padded) and iPad and still has plenty of room.  I love all the pockets and I was especially happy the side cup holder pockets are big and deep enough for a larger water bottle.  As I will be using this for travel the other feature I was looking for was the strap on the back that will secure it to my luggage.  I honestly can't think of anything else I would need in a backpack! Thank you!
5,I ride public transit every day & walk from the station to my destination regardless of weather (last week I walked through pouring rain with this bag). I love that this bag is truly water proof easy to disinfect and fits whatever I might have with me & don’t want to put down in public spaces. The bag offer lots of options for easy access on the front as well as more secure inner pockets. I wish I had bought this sooner.. I have used it every single day since I bought it about a month ago & I haven’t noticed any signs of wear.
5,Perfect size for traveling.  Lotsa pockets to store snacks electronics personal items
5,I love this backpack. I’m back to clinical work at inpatient hospital it hold all my needs and is sturdy so far it’s been a few months. I haven’t had any issues with straps loosening or anything. I think this is perfect for a flight carry on also. Just haven’t been able to use it for that yet!
5,This is a very nice and versatile bag! I bought this to travel because I like the style of a backpack but the ones I had didn't have the strap to fit on my rolling bag and were either too big or too small.  I've begun using this backpack as my everyday bag to and from work and can fit my lunch my gym clothes and all my necessities in it every day.  Great backpack! Soooo many pockets! They definitely help to keep me organized.
5,I use this bag for work and it has simplified getting to and from home. Holds laptop notebooks and ALL my purse items! Top opens very wide to see EVERYTHING at once. Love it!
5,For traveling. Will see how it holds up.
5,Backpack has tons of space within and honestly surprised me! Will be keeping this at the top of list for back packs.
5,I love this bag! So much space and lots of compliments! I returned a different bag for this one and don’t regret it one bit. I may purchase another as a gift.
5,I have been looking for YEARS for perfect traveling backpack I have found it!!  I have a weekend full of stuff including 2 pairs of shoes and makeup in this and it’s perfect. It also is amazing for an airplane. The top unzip feature is a game changer. LOVE LOVE LOVE this backpack!!
5,I bought this for cross country flights. I was looking for something cute to use as a carry on that would protect my computer and have enough separate storage to keep my various things organized. It was perfect. I love all the pockets and the larger side pouches for water bottles that fit my hydro perfectly. My only issue with this bag is that the color is much lighter than in the photos and I wanted a deeper mint color. As far as function goes it’s been perfect.
5,This bag was perfect for travel. Everything was as described. It doesn’t seem cheaply made which can be a gamble on Amazon when you can’t see or touch something in person. Was not at all disappointed. Looks and feels classy. Comfortable to wear. Recommending it to anyone who has to fly. So easy to hook on your carry on and get stuff in and out of without dumping your stuff everywhere. Couldn’t be happier!
5,Just like the picture. So many pockets perfect for students or moms! Very stylish
5,Just get it
5,Both my partner and I have this bag and love the separate compartments. So much better than other bags we’ve owned  a great wrk bag. You won’t be disappointed
5,This bag has plenty of room and plenty of zippered pockets. Yet unlike most backpacks it doesn’t scream  “bearded man hiking” — its aesthetic is somewhat feminine/fashionable. My 16” laptop fits easily with room to spare. Only one small suggestion for improvement: the piggyback strap barely fits over my roller board handles. So tight in fact I gave up trying. Still I love it. It’s going with me on every trip from now on.
5,Great product and quality just like the pictures. Love it!
5,This bag was great. I purchased it to use as a carry on. I had this stuffed to the brim and it held up beautifully was comfortable on my shoulders and slipped under the seat in front on me with no issues whatsoever. It had a lot  of compartments which was helpful in keeping everything organized.
4,I got this to be a personal item when I fly and it works great! I am able to hold anything I need in it (work and personal laptop kindle headphones thin blanket snacks and Nintendo switch for the kids)! My ONLY grievance with this backpack is that because of the structure and the square-ish top it can be difficult to zip up especially if you only have one hand or on the move. I typically need to step out of the way and set it down so I can use two hands.
5,Great product!
4,I was excited to use this bag on a recent short trip.  My need for this type of bag was that I wanted a personal item size bag that I could easily carry but that could also fit over a roller suitcase handle.  My previous small duffel was great but carrying it on my should was painful when doing long terminal walks.  This bag solves the issue because it is also a backpack.I packed a 15" computer and a 10" tablet along with toiletries clothing and electronic accessories.  The internal padded laptop pocket cradled my 15" laptop and the internal pocket on the other side housed my tablet.  Once those items were packed there was plenty of room inside to pack the other items.  The external zipper pockets are easily accessible and I was able to sort those items I need to grab quickly.  I did find that my cough drop bag slipped down in the front packet so that they "hid" under the fold of the bag.  The 2 side pockets held a collapsible cup and a purchased soda bottle The soda bottle fit into the side pocket but didn't fit perfectly and ultimately I lost the bottle either when I took the back out from under my seat or when I was running through the airport terminal.The fully loaded bag fits nicely under a passenger seat even the smaller aisle seat.  The blue-gray color is mostly gray. The stitching is good and the bag seems to be well made.  The zippers glide easily. Used as a backpack the bag carries like a stiffer backpack and used as a secondary bag over a roller bag this bag fits well and doesn't budge.The top hinges open like a doctor's medical bag and it is easy to see the contents inside.
5,I just received this backpack a few weeks ago and have used it for two trips now. I'm definitely impressed with how much it can hold and is still comfortable to wear. I'm 5' so finding something that fits well can be difficult and recently returned a much more expensive bag.The one thing that I dislike about the bag is because of the frame I can't zip the main compartment with 1 hand. Other than that I'm happy I bought it.
3,I really enjoy this backpack but just last week the clasp that adjusts the length of the left strap broke.  This makes an otherwise great bag not functional as a backpack especially as I want to be able to bike with it. Maybe I could tie the sting somehow but after only two and a half months of using this backpack this is really disappointing.  Otherwise I have nothing bad to say about it which is a shame!  I like that it is waterproof I like the compartments and I like the laptop sleeve inside.  I have the green version and it looks nice and gets a lot of compliements.  Unfortunately now I can only use one strap to carry it around so I will have to go back to using my old backpack.
4,Overall good. Top handle snaps broke within a week though.
5,This is by far one of the best bags every! I used it recently for a 2 week trip to Portugal and it surpassed all my needs! It’s so roomy lightweight and comfortable. You can put so much in it and there’s easy access. I’m headed to buy another one in a different color now.
5,This has a metal frame inside which helps it stay upright when you open it. Very nice touch! Lots of pockets on the outside for easy access to things like a phone and wallet. Takes up a lot less room than my big shoulder bag but somehow holds more (?!) like magic!
5,This is perferct for work and travel. I have a lot of health issues so its important to me to be prepared for any one of multiple issues and so I was looking for something that would hold any and all items I may need while also being able to cart around a work laptop gym clothes and my lunch. This thing meets all the critera I needed. its secure and spacious! 10/10 recommend. Came a bit damged on one of the front pockets (just asthetics not function) but it has held up great and I love it so much!
5,I totally love this backpack!  -- I don't usually waste my time with reviewing but I feel compelled to review this one to share the good stuff.I am usually quite particular with details and this backpack surpassed my expectation in all ways! I feel  so so lucky to pick it! Like how you can only pray for a perfect swimming suit I feel the same way with this backpack.It is very light weight but it looks sturdy. they really paid attention to the parts that need strengthening and made sure the connecting spots are securely sewed.the design is elegant yet it is spacious -- it fits my 13' Mac and I can easily fit 6-8 books and notebooks and it doesn't look ugly when filled that full.the strips are thickly padded so that the weight doesn't cut into my body.The only (semi) shortcoming I would comment on is the water resistance performance. the material in the main body does pretty well in resisting water but the strips of cloth on the top -- usually the part exposed to the most rain water is not water resistant. but I guess I won't walk in heavy rain for that long so I guess this should be fine.I like it like it like it!
5,My husband is rarely jealous of my purchases but I’m pretty sure he just ordered his own bag because he’s so envious.I LOVE THIS BAG. No one should be this into their work laptop bag but this bag is worth it. Nothing compares to the ease of having that “Dr. bag” wide mouth opening of the bag. It causes the inside to be this cavernous space where everything  is easily found. With this opening there’s none of that flopping side of a bag when you are digging through a normal back pack. This bag stays upright while you are poking around in it. The laptop spot fit my clunky 15” laptop with ease( along with some take hone folders. Also- it’s so much more lightweight than any (rather expensive) Ogio bags that I’ve had throughout the years.  The material feels nice the bag has zero bulk to it it has so many pockets to keep me organized it looks awesome and it fits on my carryon suitcase handle….and it doesn’t cost $100!!!! I’m so stoked to have something this easy to lug all of my stuff I’ve never had a better work bag!!!(Ps- not sure why this is labeled specifically to women- I have the gray and it’s not in the least bit feminine!)
5,Love this bag.. color is great.. works well for travel and fits a ton of things
5,This fits my laptop plus extra monitor with plenty of leftover room for everything else.  Straps are comfortable.
5,I bought this for a trip because I typically use a regular backpack when I travel and I always end up digging around my bag stuffing it full and it’s just a pain. THIS backpack however has SO many different pockets there’s a place for EVERYTHING. It feels sturdy and looks cute. I got a compliment right after I got to the airport. So worth it.
5,Great for my trip to Paris. Well made and easy to carry and store. Everything fit nicely
5,Hi I am disabled and use a motorized wheelchair. As soon as I got into the wheelchair I realized there was no place to put my stuff.  In fact there is hardly any space for anything except me.I tried various bags tote bags craft bags purses messenger etc. And then Hap Tim Laptop Backpack Travel Backpack came up in my search.1. I wanted something big enough to carry my 15" laptop2. I wanted a trim profile3. I needed water resistance4. I wanted to store drinks5.  I needed one which fits on my wheelchairHap Tim Laptop Backpack Travel Backpack delivered. I have dark grey as my wheelchair seat is black and I wanted some color difference.  I put some pins on mine as I am a child...  So far I have not put my laptop in the bag it rarely leaves my home however I had an organizer for one of my other bags which fits snug into it but as it is just that big it does not allow many things in the side pockets just no room.This backpack acts more like a purse with it's wide opening top and enough pockets. Oh and it feels great to wear the straps don't chafe me nor get in my way.  5'4" 180lbs.The only little thing i would like changed is more padding for the small handles that's it.I recommend this but it has only been a week and it has not been out in the rain nor stuffed full like for a trip. I will update if anything changes.
5,Love the way this backpack opens at the top. It makes loading it up much easier and the wide opening makes it easy to find my items without having to take everything out. Love the colors and it is very well made.
5,With the transfer of my jobs I have to travel to other cities often and have to take a laptop on business trips. Last time I brought my laptop in a messenger bag during 3 days travel it was too hard as you have to wear it with a heavy laptop. I decided to change a backpack style laptop bag which should be light and the capacity should be enough to bring all my essentials of course it has to be suitable for women's style.I have been looking for the backpack a long time on AMAZON most of them are men's style too big not suitable for women. I happened to see HAP TIM doctor bag style backpack. It caught me because its product description meets all my requirements and the price is great I decided to try it.Soon I received this backpack from Amazon it's really good I love it. It is a professional laptop backpack. 1) It looks very elegant very suitable for girls 2) its capacity is really big It can fit a 15.6" laptop computer a leather folder few clothes for changing mobile power bank power cord and Converter a private toiletries bag and small cosmetic bag. 3) The biggest plus to this bag and probably one of the main reasons i picked this bag over other bags is its padded laptop sleeve is adjustable you can fit a 13" 14" 15" laptop well and this adjustable sleeve will wrap your electronics well you don't need to worry about they will be hurt by scratch or hit. 4) There are a lot of exterial storage pockets --It is really convenient for you to take small things that you often use such as sunglasses mobile phones keys sunscreen cream etc. 5)the fabric of this bag is synthetic it's kind of light and strong fabric also it's water resistant -- I poured a glass of water on bag the water immediately slipped away while the outer cloth was not soaked.According to my personal experience if you are a girl this package is very suitable. Super practical!! For a Men maybe consider more of the look but such a cheap and easy to use backpack I would recommend it to everyone.
5,Was all I expected.
5,Colorway purchased: Green/blackI’m a bag designer and usually very picky about overall construction/durability. I can honestly say that this bag is really well made for the cost. I bought to use as a “carry all bag” for work. Broken down:For Travel: Would mostly only use for work related travel as it is clear upon receiving that this is meant to carry laptop notebooks etc.Water resistance: Left as 4 stars for now as I have not been able to test the water resistance but material looks and feels as if it would be fine if you were walking from the office to your car in the rain.Durability: Overall construction is executed well. Fabric is thick/strong polyester as mentioned in the specs. Zippers are metal which feel more durable. Definitely do not think this is a bag that would wear out quickly. My only complaint is that the interior lining fabric feels kind of plasticy but doesn’t seem like it will be an issue
5,Perfect for fitting everything I need for work. I work in a hospital so I like that I can wipe it down after shifts to keep it clean!
5,I’ve had this backpack for a few months & I am obsessed!! It’s durable super spacious comfortable and affordable. I literally love everything about it! :)
5,I absolutely love this bag it’s perfect for work.
5,I love my backpack! Lots of pockets and very roomy! I love the texture and the color! A lot of compliments! The two side pockets are big. The only issue for me is I can't zip it up with one hand the zipper can be tricky when it goes all the way down.
5,I use this for work. I carry a laptop and other supplies. Plenty of space a s compartments. I really like the size and look.
5,Looks exactly as pictured. I’m a nurse and I have been using this as a work bag and I enjoy how much storage space it has and all the pockets. Definitely a great buy and it would be good for taking on a plane or camping trips or overnighters!
3,very good backpack just disappointed i didn’t  get the one i ordered and when my bag came it had someone’s belongings in it?? very dissatisfied with seller but quality bag
5,I researched purchased and returned half dozen backpacks many from brands in hundreds of dollar price range).  This bag: hands down winner for price construction and style.
5,I have a fairly large laptop and the pocket for laptops is perfect with there still being room for my other school books and supplies. The bag is also very durable. My bag is probably about 15-20lbs with everything I need in it and it holds up very well and the bag is comfortable with the weight (as much as 20 addition pounds can be)
5,Great for travels. I love it a lot
5,I live out of my backpack for work - I have my computer and all necessary paperwork (often a lot) for a week of traveling back and forth between client sites and this backpack is amazing.  What you don't see from the pictures is the awesome way it opens on top.  The top literally pulls open and you have access like you would a tote bag; a wide access into the whole of the main compartment.  My laptop is smaller and the velcro adjustments for that compartment are wide strips from top to bottom - no chance they will get worn and less effective over time; my laptop is snug and safe.  The straps are super easy to adjust the water bottle holders on the sides are wide and easy to access and the other pockets are great sizes - one larger one that again opens very wide to make it easy to store and find what you need (with mesh pockets inside) a smaller zipped one that's perfect for you phone or keys - no way to lose them because it zips but super fast access when needed.  On top of it all are the easy carry handles that are larger than most backpacks and make it easy to pick this up and move it from one meeting room to another.  Also when the main compartment is totally unzipped and you need to pick up and go you can do it without having to zip up first.  Other packs would flop open or spill the contents but because of this design the top just closes and you can move easily without stopping to zip it up first.  This is the best backpack I have owned.
5,This backpack is AMAZING...I love the look has plenty of pockets and space for my work/textbooks/clothes!  The water bottle side pocket fits my 32oz Takeya. I highly recommend this bag!!
5,You cannot beat the quality of this backpack for the price. I’ve gotten many compliments & easily convinced others to purchase it. I use it to carry my laptop iPad textbooks chargers water bottles the list goes on. Functionality is 100%!
5,Opens at top - wide opening and will sit open while you pack/ unpack it
5,holds a surprising amount and I appreciate all the different pockets for organizing various items.
5,I use this bag 5 days a week for work. Love how sturdy it is (doesn't flop over when I empty it). Spilled coffee all over it the first day I had it wiped right off. Great colors comfortable to wear even full.
5,Fits plenty the zippers and buttons are very sturdy. The side pockets to hold personal beverage containers are wide and fit up to a big size. Overall 10/10
5,I bought this for traveling. It’s perfectly sized and it feels high quality and durable.
5,I’m a nurse and I use this as my work bag. It has so much space. I can not only fit my whole lunch box inside but also extra sweaters and supplies. I am very impressed with the water bottle holder on the outside. It fits my large yeti water bottle no problem. Definitely recommend
5,I have had this bag for three months. It goes to work with me every day on the New York City Subway and I have made four trips with it. It is amazing! Room enough for everything I need. Great laptop holder that really protects your computer and it easily fits under the seat in front of me on any flight.  It fits so much in it that on my last two weekend trips I only took this bag.People have complained about the zippers on this bag which almost kept me from making this purchase but I have not found the zippers to be weak or bent or easily broken. After three months of perpetual use all of the zippers are still as they were the day I bought it.One minor item worth mentioning - the front pockets (there are actually four) make the bag front-heavy. When it's packed it doesn't stand upright it typically falls forward. When I'm traveling with my roller bag this not a problem as the back strap easily keeps it in place on the handle of the suitcase.I was stopped today for the 5th time by someone wanting to know what kind of bag I had and where I got it (which is what prompted me to write this review) because it is so stylish. I am an executive and am usually dressed in a suit and this bag looks as professional as I do. It's also great with my jeans on my weekend trips...just a really great purchase!
5,Needed something that wasn't too bulky and would accommodate enough for overnight business travel; this backpack is all of that plus it looks as good in person as it does in the pictures.
5,This is my 3rd try of a backpack to accommodate my laptop and necessary files.  True:  the third time is the charm.  Plenty of pockets and love the netting to hold cords and mouse.  What is most impressive is the main part of the bag which keeps my laptop absolutely secure and protected.  The laptop strap and pocket are adjustable; the best thing EVER!  The body of the bag is large with exceptional easy access; it even holds a binder without any struggle at all.  (All my previous bags required adjusting and moving to get the doctor opening to cover and close).  Back and strap padding are more than adequate; no bruises points of stress on the old bones and flesh that covers.  I know this seems like a small thing but the pocket on the side actually securely hold the water bottle (AND my tea travel cup).  My other bag required tipping the bag on the side to move the things inside to properly "seat" the bottle in the pocket.  Not so with this.  Smooth inserting in the pocket (no adjustment necessary) and it is held securely.  I ordered the blue gray only because I didn't like the lining of the black.  My greatest fear?  That the mfg. will stop making this bag if and when this one ever "wears out".  (I travel a lot for work).  I'm going to order another one just in case.  And I am SO not kidding!  I hesitated buying this because after all the previous 2 worked but not ideal.  This is the IDEAL backpack.  Don't hesitate.  Price is better than the other bags I purchased and is far superior.
5,I bought this bag for my daughter in high school. It's durable and very roomy
5,So I bought this needing a slimmer travel bag that wasn't so bulky but could hold all my stuff and be able to just act like a bag when I went to eat or anything in the city.Well when this arrived I knew it was the one! For one it had 2 extra pockets that I didn't even notice till after I put everything in it perfectly and then couldn't believe I could get things even more organized!!! (I love being organized).Main compartment has 2 pockets on each side which I find so great! My last bag had the main pocket and a sleeve for a book or tablet then one from a laptop right behind it this never seemed to jive well with me and I didn't like how things say in the bag because of it with these sperate I can put my book in the pocket behind the front and I don't feel it oddly on my back!There is a metal frame to keep it rigid and upright when I set it down but it also keeps a slimmer profile since the pockets on the front went weigh it down or cause the front to look frumpy and a jumble. I like knowing my stuff will stay in place because the bag wont fall over.I put everything in my backpack into this one. Things are better stored and much more easily accessible! I could even finally carry my DSL camera in here and have enough room and know things wouldn't move it around. And it's comfortable when I where it. I'm not used to writing reviews so I'll just say buy it if your in the fence because you won't regret it!
5,Amazing bag! Really great quality. Fits all of my nursing essentials. I can even fit my lunch bag in the bag along with my nursing gear. I love all of the different pockets and storage compartments. I’m extremely happy with this bag.
4,Very spacious!
5,I got this backpack for a two week vacation. It was perfect! It has a ton of space and pockets. It is extremely well made. I would take it to the Beach and it wouldn’t hold water or sand. This is my backpack for everything now.
5,I'm an elementary school teacher (3rd grade) and I've used this bag over a year now. It changed my life from being a bag lady to suddenly having free hands to carry lunchbox keys phone coffee etc.I don't like carrying a purse so my personal affects have their own pockets. It opens easily and can fit papers to grade has a padded pocket for laptop or other electronic devices.The top handles are flimsy and stay out of the way which is nice while zipping/unzipping. I get flustered with the stiff straps that stay in the upright position and hinder me from getting into my bag.I would highly recommend this bag.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I am an elementary school teacher and have used this backpack daily for three months now. I carry way too much but this bag allows me to have everything I would need to do my job in one place. I pack it heavy each day and I am amazed that it looks as good as the day I got it. The straps and handles are solid and strong and it sits comfortably on my back. I love the convenience of having a bag that has loads of storage space and allows me to be hands free. You will love it!
4,Great laptop backpack! Roomy even with my laptop! I love the pockets in front & the side pockets accommodate for a 1L water bottle. The handles are sturdy & the fastener on the handles is great for attaching my umbrella when I needed it quickly. There is room for 15.6in  laptop & tablet.. Also there was room to do a 4in embroidery on the front. Great for travel IS NOT water resistantbut is very durable. The plastic strap holders were cheaply made the colors were limited & didn't come in a solid black.  It does not hold its shape & is top heavy so it'll fall forward if the front top pocket is full. Overall it's well made for the price! Just wish it came in a solid black so I can reorder.
5,When I say that I spend an hour + online trying to find a backpack that will work for me it's the truth. I am so happy with this find. On the inside you have the main compartment which is huge and then you have 2 thinner sleeve-like compartments where you can easily fit a 15" laptop or some folders. On the front of the backpack you have multiple smaller compartments. I love these because I am able to access keys my phone pens etc swiftly without having to dig. Overall this is for someone who likes to stay organized. Highly recommend!
5,I have used this bag for the past 5 years and it still does everything promised! The water-proof feature was a need when purchasing and this product follows through on its promise! Loaded with pockets decorated in a modern style and serves any and every thing you need for a back pack. The extra electronics padding has also given me piece of mind when traveling as well. 10/10
5,I really love my new travel backpack! I've only used it once so I cannot speak to its durability but it had more than enough room for what I needed to bring on my flight very comfortable to wear and fashionable in appearance!
3,The inside is very narrow and you can’t put much in it. Pretty useless for my trip out the country
5,I use this for going back and forth to work.  Sometimes I have my laptop and there is plenty of room for that along with other files.  Very pleased with this purchase.  Sharp looking bag
5,Love this backpack for carrying laptop shoes lunch - you name it.  Comfortable shoulder straps or handles for carrying.  Dividers inside to separate the laptop from other items.  Well designed.
5,I love that this bag stands up on its own and opens up completely. Holds many items with 2 very large water bottle holders on the sides and a tablet and laptop protective sleeve. Laptop sleeve fits my Macbook Pro 13' with a protective case around it. It is also waterproof! Would recommend to anyone!
5,****Update: I have been using this bag heavily for two years solid. The picture attached is what it looks like currently. It’s still in absolutely perfect condition. It’s unbelievable how well this bag has held up and what a great bag it has been. Top notch quality****I just received this bag today so I can’t speak to it’s durability over time although it does seem built to be very durable. I am surprised at how great this bag is for just a little over $30. I bought this bag for work. I’m a nurse and often work 13+ hours. I love the big open main bag. It will be easy to put in things like food or a change of clothes. The other pockets are going to be useful for the other things I need. I’m kind of wishing I had used this as a diaper bag instead of the $180 Jujube one I did have.****Update**** I have had this bag for several months now and I am still in love with it. It’s still holding up as well as when it came. It has been very durable and incredibly flexible in the troupes and amounts of things it can carry. I couldn’t have ever imagined getting such a good quality bag for this price!
5,Love this bag for traveling! The top is great for saving time digging around in your bag. I love the two laptop sleeves and all the pockets.
5,This is lightweight and spacious on the inside. The style is perfect for working and taking it out after. The tiny pockets are great for storage.
5,I spent weeks trying to find a backpack/briefcase type style work bag that would work in a professional setting. I opted to not go with a briefcase and tried this bag instead. I am so happy with my choice.-good for travelling to work and not straining the shoulders. Straps are very comfortable. I walk to work and needed something durable for weather + comfortable for a ~30 minute walk.-Big enough to fit all of my stuff (laptop many notebooks makeup bag chargers books) and yet doesn't look ridiculous on my 5'3" frame. I can tighten the straps so that the bag is right on the lower back and doesn't sag.-Aesthetic: It looks even better in person- very professional in the work place but with a little style to it.-Most bags are saggy (ie. when you put it on the floor the bag loses its shape and it becomes a sack.) What I love about this one is that it has a very strong and sturdy foundation so that when I open it the bag keeps its shape and doesn't fall to the floor.If you are looking for the perfect work bag and are picky like me- look no further! highly recommend!
5,The best thing ever!!
5,This is one of the best looking and most practical backpacks out there. I bought a couple of them. Highly recommend.
5,I used to like the backpacks with a million compartments but I learned my lesson after many trips that it is a pain to look for stuff. I am alwasy prepared with a ton of items and then forget where in the labyrinth of the bag I put it.So I decided I'd try a simpler backpack and I am so glad I did. I love this backpack! It looks really sleek and stylish. My favorite feature is the opening I haven't had a backpack that opens up to a big easy accessible square. I can see right where everything is in the bag. The top opening is a big outward opening square so no trying to push in bigger items or the laptop. It all slides in easily.Considering this was also half of the price of any backpack I EVER bought I am super happy with this one! I would purchase this one again in a heartbeat.
5,So many pockets. Everything I have fits perfectly. I love that it has 3 sleeves inside the large pocket and the water bottle holders do not take up space within the large pocket like on some other bags.
5,I love this backpack and it deserves recognition. First I spent months searching and comparing many different backpacks before making my decision because things online can be deceiving/disappointing and I'm super picky. This backpack "checks all the boxes" in that it's an ideal size (not too big or too small) has a protective laptop section (fits my 13 inch laptop that's in another cushioned sleeve) numerous pockets for organization has water bottle holders on each side (fit my 32 oz bottles) it's made of durable material etc. It is surprisingly roomy inside and the doctor bag style opening is a sophisticated touch. It also has a sleek and professional appearance (I chose the blue grey color) and doesn't feel or look cheap at all so it's great for work and college. Not to mention it's versatile and can equally suite a large man or a petite woman and everybody else in between. I can vouch for it's practicality and usefulness at an airport too! It helps make your travels a little less stressful by having a place for everything important so you don't have to rummage through stuff when in the security line etc. Overall I'm happy with this backpack and would recommend it to anyone!
5,I’m a teacher & this works great for traveling back & forth to school! It is the perfect size & keeps everything organized!
5,Purchased this in mid March.  It was great at first a little heavier than anticipated but definitely liked the style of being able to open the top part of the backpack to see everything.  I used this backpack to tote my small laptop back-and-forth to work.  Very good unisex style that looks nice and not cheap looking.  I never overstuffed the backpack and it was used pretty lightly.  Nicely organized pockets.  Unfortunately the backpack plastic buckle portion did break after two months.  Not sure how it happened but it did.  (Thinking about it I probably could have easily replaced this with an after-market buckle.)  Instead I let the vendor know.  Despite the fact that it was after 30-days the vendor responded to me right away to inquire about the quality issue.  They really wanted to understand and to fix the issue.  They even offered to send me a replacement backpack free of charge.  Wow!  Excellent customer service across the board.  How many vendors are able to go this extra distance to make things right and have a valid shared concern for the customer.  Thank you for making it right.
5,Bunch of storage space! And little pockets. Love it.
5,Must have back pack! Great for everyday use or for traveling. My friend called it the Mary Poppins bag since I kept pulling things out of it. Lots of compartments and the main bag is great for clothes or other things. I recently took it with me on a trip and fit under the seat on the airplane just fine especially with all the stuff I had in it. I love that the top opens up so you can see everything in the bag. The nooks for your laptop or tablet are nice. The straps are comfortable when carrying on your back and it has another strap you can use to put on your luggage.
5,Okay so I move around my school a lot throughout the day and I wanted nothing more than to avoid becoming the “cart lady” that wheels around all her supplies from class to class.This bag literally fits EVERYTHING.Laptop- easyTextbook-easyFolders class sets of highlighters pens and pencils two bottles of water a binder- all EASY and with room to spare.I never write reviews but this bag for that price= unbeatable
5,There is a lot of space and handy pockets for everything. Compact light and stylish. Great book bag for college students.
5,I work for emergency services and constantly moving from one client to the next and this bag holds everything.  Its light. It's strong. It's cute! Great purchase!!
5,I purchased this bag for work trips and it has worked great! It holds all my electronics securely and has lots of extra space for my personal items. Love the convenient pockets on the front for quick access.
5,I got this in October and have been using it for work and travel ever since.  It still looks new.  I love the size the way to top opening is held open all the pockets.  I carry two water bottles on a daily basis so love having 2 deep pockets for those.  My water bottles don’t fall out.  This is an outstanding backpack and I highly recommend it.  Attractive professional looking functional sturdy durable and much lighter weight than my old backpack.  What’s not to like!Update March 2022 - Use it daily and for trips and still looks great and functions really well.  I have had no issues with any part of the backpack.  I highly recommend.
5,Of all the backpacks I've had over the years (basic to custom) this one is by far the best.  It's the perfect size to fit everything I need for my daily commute to/from work and holds my laptop with no problem.  I like how it sits on my back and doesn't pull or feel heavy on my shoulders.  It's not too big causing things to get lost or end up at the bottom.  The structure of the bag is great so that it sits upright and my favorite part is the wire framed top that allows the bag to stay open when sitting so that I can easily access what I need or quickly throw things inside.  I've not used it for travel but I do like the extra strap on the bag so that is can slide on to a luggage pull.  I've only had it for a few months but it is holding up well.  Such a great price too.  I would definitely buy again!
5,I had this bag for my laptop and commuting but then stopped that job. My daughter’s company started travel again so she needed a bag. I gave her mine since I wasn’t using it currently and she loved it so much I let her keep it and bought another one for myself! Highly recommend this bag!
5,I love the color! Great as a work bag to hold laptop 2 iPads and files
4,I purchased this for school (I’m a teacher). I travel between classrooms and buildings. I wanted a backpack but I was looking for something more grown up looking. I love the style and capacity of this bag. I like the large padded slot for my laptop. Outside pockets are nice and I am glad it has the luggage strap. It does have a slight but strong smell. I’m hoping it goes away. It doesn’t bother me too much but my husband says it’s strong.
5,I use this backpack for work. I can fit so much. I take my laptop journals charger. My lunch and have so much space left over for my jacket. I love the quality of it. It has good zippers and it looks good on me. When you sit it up on a table and open it it holds its rectangular shape. I love it and would recommend it. Buy it.
5,I purchased this to carry my laptop textbook and extra cords to and from work. This backpack is amazing! Very roomy tons of pockets. Durable. Adjustable. I have a 15.7 in laptop but it would very clearly fit a 17” as well.
4,This bag was bigger than I thought which is great! :) I haven’t put it to use yet But I can’t wait to use it! I specifically got this for when I start my LVN program this November of 2021 :)
4,This backpack is exactly what I wanted.  I was looking for something very simple. I wanted an everyday laptop backpack roomy enough to hold my laptop and my insulated lunch bag.  I did not want a backpack with dozens of zippers and compartments. I ordered a couple other backpacks and returned them before buying this one.I took this bag on a business trip just days after I got it and it performed well.  It was simple and quick to slide the laptop out for TSA inspection.  It fit under the airline seat.  It's got big side packets to hold a water bottle.  I could access my wallet easily.  It's got handles on top to make it easy to carry like a brief case.  The strap across the back slides easily onto the trolley handle of the suitcase but still fits snug. About the only criticism I have of it is that it falls over when placed on the floor.  I order for it stay upright the front has to lean against something.
5,Got this backpack for work I work inside of a correctional facility where our bags have to get quickly searched before entering and after leaving. This bag allows me to keep it on my back while officers can quickly see what is inside. It is super roomy with lots of pockets that allow you to organize your stuff any way you'd like. Great purchase have already have several others ask for the link to purchase this item. I would buy again.
5,I bought this bag to use for work and work laptop. The quality is great for the price and I like the layout. Definitely recommend!
5,I travel for work and have used several bags over the past few years.  This has been the best!!  It is organized in a way that is useful.  Has an area for bottles on the sides that expand and are useful for other items.  It is light weight and has a depth to pack extra clothes if needed.  It is comfortable which for me is important as I have neck issues. I am able to safely carry my kindle my computer as well as all my other carry-on items.  I was not sure I would keep this bag!!!  It was definitely a keeper and exceeded my expectations.
5,Love this backpack! It looks great had multiple pockets and holds a lot of stuff. I tried several different ones and this one fits all my needs. It also looks great.
5,Great backpack with lots of pockets for organization and a clever laptop sleeve that can adjust to different sizes (so I can use it for my work laptop or my personal one). I’ve been carrying my laptop to work separate from my purse and hated having two things to carry plus I forgot my laptop a couple of time which was super annoying. So I was looking for a nice option to carry all my stuff at once. This bag serves that purpose wonderfully and has plenty of space for a lunchbox as well - so now I can start packing more lunches without the annoyance of bringing in 3 separate bags to work. I think it looks nice and feels well made. The zipper glide smoothly. The clam shell or doctors bag opening (or whatever it is called) makes it easy to see everything in the main compartment of the bag at once. So far it’s everything I needed!
5,I absolutely love this bag.  I was searching for something that could serve all purposes for me for the office on a daily basis as well as serve as a carry on for work travel. Both my IPad and my large laptop can fit in the protective sleeve and I can carry a notebook and papers in the separate large interior pocket.  I also still have room for lunch chargers mouse a book in the central compartment.  The side pockets have tons of room for a 32 ounce water bottle and the like.  I can keep everything organized and yet still have a non-bulky and easy to carry bag with the large center area complete with the wired frame to stand open easily.  I carry as much or more as in my prior “professional tote” but with much more ease and organization given all of the separate pockets and compartments.  And at this price!  I’ve been sharing the info with all of my coworkers.
3,I really like the size of the bag and how large the opening is at the top. What I don’t like is how heavy the bag is before you put anything into it. By the time I put a few items into it and a water bottle into the side pocket it gets uncomfortable to carry. Great concept love the size and convenient pockets it’s just too heavy.
5,This is the best backpack I’ve had in a very long time it’s sturdy and durable it’s water resistant I walked in the rain and didn’t worry about my laptop everything inside was super dry. It’s cute has great pockets pretty comfortable and has the suitcase strap for traveling.
5,I bought this because it had a high star rating but I was still a bit hesitant because I wanted more of a messenger bag. I am beyond pleased I got this!! It is absolutely the best bag I’ve ever had!! There are so many pockets and the main part holds so much. I currently have a chromebook in it’s case a MacBook a 3” binder and a couple small notebooks along with a bag of pens and all the cables for both laptops plus there’s still some room. Then I have various other things in the other pockets. The straps are cushioned and comfy. I could not recommend this enough! I want to do a infomercial for this bad I love it so much!
5,Like many I have searched for the perfect bag for a while now and have certainly found it with this backpack. Has ample pockets easily opens at top and is quite sturdy. I have put it through its paces on several shorts trips. Quite happy since I have been using this almost two years now which is admittedly a record for me using the same bag.
5,A friend has this bag and I liked the look of it so much I bought it. It hasn’t disappointed. I loveHow the top opens up all the pockets and it’s super classy looking. Two other people have ordered it since seeing mine. The price for this backpack is super reasonable for what you get.
5,I love this backpack so much! Its many compartments are very useful and it fits so many things! I use packing cubes and am able to take this backpack instead of a small suitcase!
5,i enjoy my back bag. A+
3,I had ordered this same backpack over a year ago and loved it for traveling. So I ordered another one for my husband but this one is not the same-I think it will be OK but we'll see on our next trip.This one does not have the 2-zippered pockets on the outside  but the top zipper is still 2 zippers coming together--a nice feature so nothing falls out to the side when opening.Also this one does not have the 2 leather "feet" on the bottom of the bag to protect the fabric some.It does still have the beige/brown stripped interior lining which makes it easier to spot things in the backpack unlike those backpacks that have a black lining. Straps are still padded so should be comfortable.Will try to remember to give update after using it a couple of trips.
5,This back pack looks great and is water resistant. It has a rigid frame so it doesn’t crumple when you’re looking for your items hunched over in your small seat on a bus train plane etc. Fits nicely under the seat at your feet on a plane and was my personal item for European travel. Love that it fits onto your luggage handle. I used this bag traveling to and from Philly and also to Ireland. I did not use it for hiking and site seeing as I felt it was a little too bulky and rigid for that kind of use. I can see this being a great bag for a computer for work on a daily basis though. Currently using it on family road trip from VA to FL and it is working really well in the back seat between the kids to have their books and electronics organized and easily accessible.
4,Great roomy back pack! I bought this for a trip to the Tucson Gem Show I anticipated needing to carry a lot of small but heavy items! This bag had plenty of room for all of my purchases and held up great. It has lot of pockets and storage space. I love the strap on the back that allows you to strap it to your luggage handle it stays put and doesnt slide around. The inside pocket protectors are great for laptops tablets and documents you dont want crumpled  like photos and magazines. The only thing I didnt like was the back pack itself is a but on the heavy side making it heavier with all my stuff in it. But it wasnt a deal breaker. I would have liked a chest strap too to ensure the shoulder straps dont slide.
5,I received this backpack for Christmas last year and I am obsessed!  I use it every day for work and it is great.  It comfortably holds my laptop mouse charger lunch box and two notebooks with room to spare.  I love all of the pockets it has - great for holding headphones pens business cards you name it.  I have traveled twice with this and it worked well!  The back side of the backpack where the straps are has a band across the middle of it so if you set it on top of your suitcase you can slide the band over the suitcase handle and it will not fall off - awesome!  I would recommend this backpack to anyone who is looking for a stylish not loud every day backpack.
5,I love love love this backpack. When I commute to work I have to carry my water and umbrella my food and other things that must stay dry.I have to say this backpack not only holds everything I need to carry but it has a soft "frame" to it. It does not land in a heap on the ground when you set it down. It can stand upright!It is water resistant/proof as I do walk to work in the rain and not always have the umbrella out. The zippers work very well and the structure of the bag makes it so the zippers are always easy to open and close. Several people have commented on how nice this pack is and looked into buying one as well. VERY worth the money.
5,My parking ramp is about 1/3 mile from my office.  I don't want to carry multiple bags and I have a laptop iPad work papers a bag full of chargers . . . the usual stuff.  This has just the right amount of pockets.  They're all just the right size.  The openings are just right for seeing and reaching in.  It does not feel enormous and yet it holds a TON of stuff.I LOVE the two loops at the top for when I have to pick it up like a bag and not a backpack.  The two side outside pockets are perfect for a water bottle and an umbrella.  There's a little caribener in the top outside pocket perfect for my airpod case.  It looks professional.  It has made my parking/office walk SO MUCH BETTER.  Plus it was a totally reasonable price.  Everyone who has to carry anything anywhere should really get this.
5,I’ve had this backpack for a year. I carry a MacBook Air iPad Pro and keyboard and accessories and books. It has been fantastic because of the big wide-mouth pocket in the top. I love it. Recently though one of the pieces of 1/8” wire that give it it’s shape has poked through the bend in the material. It has become a little difficult to use because I’ll get scraped by that wire when I swing it onto my back. I’ve reached out to see if they have any suggestions. Hopefully there’s a fix because I really like the backpack.4 days later...Even though my backpack was beyond warranty they offered me 40% off a new one. I am very impressed with their customer service.
5,I had low expectations of this bag working out after purchasing several other laptop bags that ended up getting returned for various reasons. This bag was a different story. It has pockets in all the right places and easily fits everything I need for work. I have been using it on a daily basis for over a month now and I think it still looks new. I am not wearing this bag throughout the day I would like to point out - I load it with my laptop notebooks mouse etc. at the end of the work day take it home and then bring it bag and unload and start over. So I wouldn't say it's getting heavy use. If you are looking for a bag that will get worn throughout the day with a heavy load I'm not sure this is the bag for you. It doesn't offer back support or padding but for just back and forth to work wearing it minimally it works great for me!
5,Great bag! I can put my 15.6 laptop in the padded sleeve easily. Still room for ring-binder and several textbooks. Love the pockets!Exterior and zippers all seem durable. A strike against: not the most ergonomic for long term backpacking. Im not sure these types of laptop backpacks ever are though. I only use it to carry items to my car.I really like the side pockets for beverage containers; thick expandable elastic.Interior has a nice quality feel as well. Besides the padded pocket there is another pocket where full-size documents can be put for added protection.This bag design would work for guys as well. Its just an all-around great backpack.
5,I really like this backpack.  I read tons of reviews and looked at lots of other options available.  This one definitely fit my needs. Pockets make for easy organization and I like the fact that it is lined with a light color fabric - makes it really easy to find things.  With other backpacks I have used if the lining is black it makes it impossible to find power cords chargers other items that are black - for those it's much like staring into the abyss and not being able to find anything.  This one having the light colored lining made a big difference when trying to find something in the main compartment or pockets.  Not sure on the water resistance yet or the durability but the design and function was as expected.
5,My daughter is a Senior in college and loves this.  She appreciates the side pockets for her water bottles. Easy to use.  Also the way it contains her laptop.
5,Very stylish versatile able to hold a lot.  Perfect back pack for school hiking road-tripping work diaper bag etc.
5,Fantastic travel bag that is comfortable stylish and well organized. Loved the pockets and two  bottle/cup holders on the side. This bag has well laid-out compartments for all your electronics and personal items with smooth zippers. Highly recommend!
4,This is a personal preference but the form of the bag slouches when I place it in a standing position even when it's filled with books and my computer.  I like a bag that is slightly firm so that it can vertically stand on its own when I put it on a chair or the ground. Because of this it's not balanced and the bag often falls flat unless it's resting on a wall or an object to keep it standing up.  It's also slightly more bulky than I expected. But overall the material is great quality and durable and I love all the pockets.
5,Great bag! Love the structured top the padded laptop sleeve the number of compartments. I carry around two laptops with all of their accessories as well as spiral notebooks my lunch and a water bottle with plenty of room to spare. The luggage strap on the back will make it great for traveling too. I wondered if it would be harder to find things since you can’t unzip all the way down the sides like a traditional backpack but I find the more structured form actually keeps things more organized. I read reviews for many (many!) of the other backpacks on Amazon in this price range and I’m very happy with my selection.
5,My feeling is that everything about this bag is stylish and functional. I'm just back from a trip and found it very easy to manage for airline travel. I love the wide top opening  the carry handles that snap together and the light color on the interior (easy to see into the bottom of the bag). The smaller front pocket has a small clip for your keys - handy!  I never did try it over my larger suitcase handle but I'm glad it has that slide through option on the back. My only negative is that the shoulder straps were a bit wide for me - but I'm not used to wearing a backpack - maybe this is a standard width.  (I'm 5'4 woman medium build 125 lbs). My tip...I used small organizer bags for the items I put inside - made it so easy to find things.
4,Love this bag except for the odder.  Fresh out of the box it wreaked badly. I am into day 3 of out gassing the bag out doors. This is what I do like.  While I don't have a laptop or any other device other than my Galaxy S7 I do have bulky medical equipment. Everything fits with room to spear.  I appreciate the 2 side pockets for water bottles or a large diabetes pouch. My purse fits in the bag along with my nebulizer.  All the zippered compartments are very handy.  The back straps are a bit large for my small-narrow shoulders and a bit stiff.  I think I can get around this small discomfort for the other advantages. I like that I can hang it on my wheeled luggage and it stays securely.  other than the really terrible odder it is a wonderful bag.
4,It has a lot of pockets opens WIDE to put a bunch of stuff in i do love that about this bag! Its good quality and the sewing is real good so it doesnt unravel on any parts. I pack a lot o stuff and it holds very well. The only downside was I packed a tupperware of soup that was suposed to be a leak-proof tupperware but wasnt. The soup leaked thru the bag it was in and then continued to leak thru the bottom of my backpack. Yeah that sucked. So even tho the top or outside of the backpack is waterproof from rain it is not leak-proof. I wasnt looking for that quality in a bag but now I realize that couldve been a plus considering the mess that came thru. I still use this bag everyday for work and I get so many compliments on it!
5,Great for work and nursing school! Holds all I need for work (extra uniform bandage scissors stethoscope 20 pens pen light notebook drink snack and toiletries) I love the different pockets it helps me organize! It is wonderful for my nursing classes also it is a very roomy bag and the straps are padded well I’m so glad I bought this bag!
5,I love this bag! It’s HUGE on the inside. After purchasing as a diaper bag I selfishly used it for a one week trip and had plenty of room to even make a few purchases on the trip. I honestly can’t wait to use this as a diaper bag. It’s going to be perfect for both her and my things.
5,Forget tumi choose this bag!! It’s a nice bag to carry a amount of things. I am a teacher i have to walk from building to building every day so i need needed a backpack that was light durable and classy.I love all these features:- The fabric seems pretty sturdy and durable.- Adjustable computer pouch -actually it can fit any size laptop whose size less than 15.6""- Really roomy It fit my 1.5 inch binder 15.6 inch laptop purse laptop charger pencil bag plus water bottle and umbrella on both of sides of the bag- Stylish for women. I feel like it has more of feminine touch to it but anybody could honestly rock it.- Comfortable this bag is light with thick sponge padded back and shoulder straps you will feel very comfortable wearing it.- Luggage strap on back -- you can very easy to fix your computer bag onto big pulley suitcase and free your hand.So this bag is definitely a good bag to carry a amount of things for work or travel.
5,I needed a new backpack but I couldn't spend a lot of money. I was struggling trying to figure out which one to get. I was concerned because some people mentioned a smell. I have a very sensitive nose and it smelled nice and fresh. I love the fact that it stands up so easy to pack with lots of room. It's also very easy to zipper closed in comparison to regular backpacks. It will also hold my umbrella on one side and my large water bottle on the other with no worries of anything falling out. All the compartments are perfect my laptop is easy to take in and out and is protected and does not move around. It's really well- made and lightweight at the same time. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,I purchased 2 of these type of backpacks.  Holds a lot.  Very roomy.  Great for office bag.  Great for travel bag.  Just a great bag.  I just wish it had a connection to charge my phone like my other bag.
5,I use this product for home care nursing. I needed a bag that was large enough for my supplies but not too difficult/heavy to carry around. I prefer a backpack style as opposed to a messenger or rolling bag. The front pocket on the bottom is perfect for vitals equipment the padded computer pockets fits my 15" laptop a legal pad + pocket folder fit in the pocket across from the computer and I carry 2 gallon size Ziploc bags with extra supplies and room to spare. Top of the bag has a hinge opening so you can see what you are pulling out of your bag vs. digging around. I have been using it for a month now and it is holding up well no signs of wear at all. I have only been out in light rain for a few minutes and had no leaks. Two other nurses in my department have now purchased this bag.
5,I love the top handles on this.  I bought a second one.
5,Used this on a cruise as my carry on and for excursions. Plenty of space and lightweight! Much better than I expected
4,I wanted a nice day pack for travel/touring days at home or vacation. My complaint with other backpacks that held computers or tablets is that the compartments were too small to hold other bags (shaving kit lunch bag camera bag). This backpack has an open comparment that held my tablet drawing supplies books headphones small first aide kit and lunch bag without a problem. The front pockets organize charger and cords well with another spot for my wallet and keys. Plus another spot for my phone. The side pockets held a water bottle and umbrella with no problem. My only complaint is a waist belt might make it more comfortable to wear but it is really designed more to be placed on a rolling bag. But I am still happy with it.
5,This is the best backpack. So much room!  Such a great quality. I’ve been using this for traveling And this has been so great as a personal item on a plane. I’m in love with it. Side pockets for water bottles. Huge compartment for all your stuff and a travel strap to go on the luggage handle without it falling out. Love it!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This bag is awesome. First let me say it is very accommodating to a large laptop and multiple books. It is also cushioned and protects your device from every angle.The bag offers large cup compartments with elastic expanders so any size cup or jug will fit. In addition to 4 front pockets of various sizes.The bag also has a travel/luggage expander so that you can securely place it on top of your luggage and roll through the airport or subway.The bag is waterproof and appears to be durable. I have an expensive bag from OGIO that was previously purchased and it doesn’t compare in size and there isn’t much difference in quality.The only thing I would change is the handles. I would add cushion to the top handles.I look forward to using this bag often.
5,love it
5,Best bag I’ve ever owned. I use this as my “purse” with a wristlet inside as my wallet so if I just need to run out real quick I just take that but let me tell ya this backpack doesn’t look big but omg it holds ALL MY MOM STUFF with room to spare! I’ve had so many compliments on it. And two friends at work have ordered and have been just as impressed. I’ve had it for several weeks now and no issues with ripped seams or stitching and let me just say I carry around A LOT of crap. Kids. You know how it is. For this price I don’t care if it does rip in a few months I’d get the same one and hey a great excuse to try a different color. I got the gray.
5,I love how it opens up wide for easy access.Perfect amount of pockets for keeping items separated.
5,I purchased this backpack after one of my coworkers showed me theirs. I love all of the compartments the fact that it can slip over a carryon bag handle and how much it can hold.We both took them on a business trip and two of our other coworkers are now going to buy it too. You won't regret it!
5,I love this backpack! It fits my MacBook with plenty of room to spare. I got this to replace my laptop bag lunch bag purse and etc that I had to carry separately each day to work. The inside can fit all this and more. The water bottle pockets on the side fit my wide water bottle and there’s TWO of them! I got the dark gray and leather. It looks more black than gray which is what I was hoping. Overall I think it’s a great purchase for the price.
5,I bought this to take as my 1 personal bag for a plane ride. I stuffed it pretty well and it fit perfectly under the plane seat. It has a lot of different compartments to fit all sorts of items. Fits comfortably on your back. I highly recommend.
5,I’ve had this bag for 6 months and I’ve taken it on hikes through European cities and countless airports in America. I travel ALOT for work so lemme tell you this bag is dope. It fits under any airline seat no matter how much you stuff in it and it holds SO MUCH. I stuffed it once with two laptops a days change of clothes sandals a rolled up down jacket 2 books toiletry kit some snacks and my small tech bag. Plus the small pockets hold my small set of medicines (bandaids tums Advil) and my bamboo cutlery. It still all fit in the bag and under the seat. It fits perfectly on a carryon bag is comfy on the back and super durable. And I got 3 other people to buy this bag and they LOVE it. Just do it.
4,I hate switching bags or carrying multiple bags so I wanted one attractive and security checkpoint friendly bag that I could use daily  but would also be easy to add stuff as needed. Material is nice interior is roomy and laptop pad is really well-designed. Gate top opening makes it easy to load and remove things and to see what's inside. The problem is balance. I put everyday smaller items in the front pockets for easy access - phone pens wallet and keys - but unless it's jam packed on the interior the whole bag just keels over forward flat. I tried to love it but it ended up being more of a hassle for me. If you always carry a bunch of larger stuff it would probably be great.
5,I cannot rave about this backpack enough. I have had it for over a year and it still looks brand new. I use it daily for work - it gets thrown on the floor or in the back of my car and on the floor at work. I usually only use one strap for a quick grab and sling and most backpacks the one strap starts to wear and tear. This one hasn't. It's still going strong! Holds all of my stuff plus more! I carry a huge water bottle and it fits in the side pockets no problem. Protects my laptop wonderfully and cleans easily. LOVE IT!
5,I'm a traveling nurse aide and needed a bag to suit my needs. This bag has exceeded my expectations. It holds everything I need plus more. I even bought a second one for my mother as a gift who also loves hers too. I would definitely rebuy once or if it ever needs replaced but so far it's very durable.Side note: I have had several colleagues along the way ask about this bag and are now purchasing.
5,My son wanted a backpack that opens on top instead of zip down. His school requires binders but it fits with most of his school stuff.  The only thing that doesn't fit is his lunchbox. He loves it and his water bottle fits in the side pocket ok but it's skinnier. It has been used for a couple months but it hasn't really rained yet so I don't know about waterproofing. Overall he loves it and it works great.
5,I love the size the color and all the pockets. I can’t speak to the durability as I just got it but at this price even if I had to replace it once a year it’s not a loss. It has so many pockets I forgot about the bottom front zippered one and thought I left my ID badge and pens at home before I noticed it lol. I am using it for work w a laptop and supplies. And I’m debating ordering one for personal use.
5,Great bag; super happy with it!
5,I finally ordered this Hap Tim laptop backpack as the price was so attractive and i love the sleek shape.  I’m actually happy I did. I keep my 15.5” laptop in a laptop bag/sleeve which is adjustable there are still a lot of room to spare.This is a doctor bag shape backpack it stands on table with big rectangle open (there is a metal frame on the open of bag) you can look inside everything is organize well and very easy to fetch out what you want.Many external pockets very practial for me to put my private stuffs like sunglass sunscreenmy keys iphone......as well as a big front pocket for your electronics devices like power bank charger power adapter....This is made of good great material. Super chic and the top handles of the bag comes with a clasp.There are 2 side pockets for bottle of water or umbrella.Very good bag for me. I love it.
5,I bought this for my daughter who is a teacher.  She raves about the roomy interior laptop sleeve large pockets and padded straps.  She also loves the "stay open" top.  I don't  know about the durability  yet but it seems sturdy and well made.  My daughter also loves the fact that it has water bottle pockets on the outside because many of the backpacks don't  have them.
5,I love my new bag! The material doesn’t seem super durable but I also haven’t had it long so I don’t want to give a bad review if I haven’t experienced it.Update: two years later and the bag has held up wonderfully. It is my favorite accessory - hold the laptop purse phone and comes with water bottle holders too. I like the multiple compartments and strap to slide over my luggage handle. Mine is gray but I bought this in red as a gift for a co-worker. She loves it too! Great value!
5,I purchased this backpack for work. I am a speech therapist for the public schools and I can fit a lot in this bag. It has been handy carrying some therapy materials back and forth to work for virtual learning. I like how it stands upright and has several different pockets. I have no complaints so far and I’ve been using it for months
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love this bag! I purchased the great backpack that has excellent padding on the handle straps and on the back of the bag and I used them on an almost three week European vacation. I love how many pockets it has because it helps to keep everything organized. It's made of a very nice material and the zippers slide very nicely.  The bag is very comfortable to wear for long periods of standing around and waiting in airports and train stations. It was well made; sturdy yet lightweight. No regrets at all. If anyone is looking for a backpack this is what I am going to recommend. It's nice looking and a great price.
5,This is a great bag.  I'm a night shift nurse. This bag holds all my things plus my portable heater.  I love it.
5,I love this backpack! I am a mom of a 3 & 4 year old and I have been looking for a bag that would work for all three of us but isn’t a diaper back. I love how the top of the bag opens wide so I can see inside and organize everything. It also stands up really well but so am not store a laptop in there iPad sometimes and kindle. The side pockets for water bottles are perfect. Small zipper pocket on the front is great my phone and all the pockets are great for all the little things necessary for daily stuff with kiddos.
5,For the price point this bag is outstanding.  It has tons of storage and features that you'd find in a much more expensive bag.  I hate heavy and bulky bags so I'm always on the hunt for bags that are the right balance of lightweight yet substantial.  I tend to wear blacks and grays so the more muted color scheme of the dark gray bag is perfect for me.  The only potential negative is if you want to use this bag for travel in warm climates.  There's nothing ventilating about the back and the fabric is dense compared to more breathable water resistant fabrics.
5,I'm using this as my carry-on bag on the airplane. The bag is well made with strong materials and adequate pockets. I love the opening at the top. It can fit lots of stuff but it looks small and neat from the outside. The laptop compartment is quite protective because it is padded. The zippers are strong and run easily.I'll be working as a teacher in a foreign country soon and I'm planning to use this as my everyday school bag. It's roomy enough to hold books my laptop and Tupperware containers of lunch. There are two small ribbed rubber soles on the outside of the bag so that it can stand upright.I think this bag can also be used for hiking/ weekend/day trips too.
5,Wonderful for travel. Just the right size to fit all the In flight necessities. Fits on rolling bag well and with the strap to go over the rolling bag handle it stays put. Just the right amount of pockets in the right places to be super convenient.
5,Love how big and roomy the inside is! It’s perfect for a college student with lots of books and notebooks. Large enough to hold a change of clothes with all the books.
5,The dislike I have is that they need more color to be available.
5,I get more compliments on this pack and have most likely sold 4 or 5 by sharing how awesome it is. Love the number of compartments wide bottom that allows backpack to stand up on its own. Front flap with magnet is handy. Second compartment with places for pens opens all the way for easy access. Love the top pocket that is shallow enough for easy access (i.e. passport boarding passes etc.) inside has a pocket for computer and another for keeping papers flat. Lots of space in the middle. Such a great value! I would have paid twice the amount to buy this. Just wish it came in more colors.
4,It’s cute and durable. I do with it had a little more back support. I use it for my laptop during work. Also great for a purse/carryon bag when flying.
5,I would order it again!
5,I’ve had this backpack for 2 years and it still looks brand new. It’s been to 9 states and 3 countries and does a phenomenal job of keeping me organized. It’s a perfect travel bag!
5,What a relief to discover this backpack! It meets my needs perfectly.  I am an educator who daily lugs all kinds of things to work including laptop ipad phone books student folders lunch a large water bottle etc.  Working downtown I end up parking several blocks from my school.  In the past I felt like a pack mule carrying various totes bags computer case etc. but this backpack has changed everything!  I can easily fit all those essentials into this backpack.  It is has lots of great pockets and the doctor bag-style opening of main compartment is perfect.  It's easy on the back well-made comfortable and stylish.  Best purchase I have made in a long time!
5,I saw this style of backpack on many people when I traveled to Australia. It opens wide at the top like a doctor's bag because it has a metal frame lining the opening. It doesn't flop over like many other backpack styles. I am a teacher and needed a new bag for school. I wanted a backpack that would go with everything and yet be stylish too. This gorgeous bag fit the bill!  It holds my macbook air securely 3 large text books daily planner 40 ounce water bottle and wallet phone keys snacks etc with room for more. It has a snap key ring in one of the pockets. It's comfortable to wear.  I couldn't be more pleased.
5,I am very picky about the bag I carry to/from the office.  This bag is perfect!  It holds my MacBook easily secured in a padded pocket.  Plenty of room for day planner my office Surface etc.  Even a pair of shoes!  The inside is light fabric so easy to see.  Outside pockets are great for smaller items like chargers etc.  And the two pockets on the side are big enough for a good size water bottle.  I carry this thing everywhere and love it.  Will use for travel as well.  Highly recommend.  Great price too!
5,I LOVE this bag!  I gave my daughter my old travel backpack and needed a new one.  I bought a DSLR camera insert for it as well.  This baby holds the DSLR 2 lenses a laptop 2 iPads my wallet and still has room to spare.  You can also put a charger in the front pocket and run a cable through the headphone slot.  I lugged this thing around for a camp this weekend and it was perfect.
5,Awesome backpack. I will be using it for work and for travel.Plenty of storage and the top opens up wide - you can see clearly all the way down. The extra pockets are nice and sturdy. Not sure about the water proof durability yet but I will update once I use this bag for my trip!
5,I got this backpack a little over a month ago for my daily commute to work on public transit as well as traveling for work and it's amazing. It's attractive and professional looking but also durable. I wore it in the rain yesterday and the contents of my backpack stayed dry. Straps are very comfortable even when I load it up for overnight travel. I can fit everything I need for one to two nights in it. Stands up on its own well and the doctor bag opening makes things easy to get to. If you want a great reliable bag but don't want to spend too much money this is absolutely the bag for you.
5,Looks great.  Only used once so far for a trip overseas.  Fits a lot of stuff and the compartments are very nice.  I like that it has rubbery pieces at the bottom so when you put it down the fabric is not all on the floor.  The side pockets held a water bottle well with a little elastic to help.  The straps are comfortable and well designed.  The only thing I would add is a zipper pocket in the back that is against your back for more security.  The color is nice too.  Love the 'doctor style bag' opening at top.
5,I have been looking for a work bag that had great organization and this is it! I love all the pockets. Great dividers in the large compartment. The 3 smaller pockets provide lots of options and the side pockets stretch to easily hold a water bottle or umbrella. The trolley strap will come in handy when traveling.
5,I absolutely love this backpack! It’s so functional and I get compliments on it all the time. I’m an itinerant teacher so often carry a lot of things with me and this backpack really supports the weight without killing my back. We are traveling to Disney soon and I plan to take it there as well!
5,I have had this for about 18 months and it has held up beautifully! I travel monthly with it and also used it daily when going into the office (pre-Covid). It is great for my large Lenovo P50 laptop. Love that the pocket to hold the laptop is adjustable. Well worth more than I paid! The only thing is you can’t do is fit your lunch in it unless you shimmy in a sandwich or something flat.
5,I love this bag.  I use it to carry my laptop to work. It is chic and professional.  Doctor style bag makes it easy to carry gym shoes and lunch in one bag.  Light fabric with doctor style hinged opening makes seeing what is in the bottom easy.  I specifically looked for 2 side bottle pockets - one is for my water bottle the other is for my umbrella.  I liked the charging cable hole.I've been using this bag for months and I still love it.  My co-workers offered multiple compliments.
5,My favorite backpack! Its so comfortable on your shoulders and can hold a lot of weight. Originally bought it as a carry on for a weekend vacation and I use it all the time! Fit perfectly under the airplane seat and a weekends amount of clothes and toiletries. It's also cute! So many pockets and zippers to put various items in.
5,This is my work bag. I LOVE the top opening.  It has a sturdy "bar" around the edges that help it stay open somewhat making it  easier to go in and out of when reaching in from a sitting position. The little velcro strap inside is useful to keep that section tight and tidy so you can rummage through the open area. Good design. I'm very happy with this purchase.
5,Love this backpack!  Made well and is exactly as described. Fits on the handle of my carry-on.  Comfortable and lots of room!  Well done Hap Tim!
5,I looked everywhere for a trolley bag that was comfortable lightweight and could fit everything I needed for a work trip. This feels pretty slim but when you open the "doctor bag" center portion it becomes vast! Even I not a spare packer could probably get by with it for a 1 - 2-day business trip. My laptop not small fits comfortably and safely since the sleeve is customizable. Everything I need seems easily accessible in all the smart pockets. And it's not ugly. Everyone I know who travels a lot for work sees it and wants it. Feels like it will last a while--I hope so.
5,Buy it.  It's great. I love the hinged top design all the pockets the luggage strap waterproof material and the stripe interior. (so many are black inside so things disappear. )  The straps are a little long for me and the snap on the diagonal pocket are misaligned in my bag but that is probably just mine. I love it anyhow.  Perfect plane bag.  I have had it 2 years and no busted zippers.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This backpack has exceeded my expectations met every knee that I was looking for and that was a top open backpack with the carry handles and adjustable backpack straps as well as a compartment that can fit my 15.6 inch laptop
5,I love this backpack and my favorite feature is the wide opening and that it will basically stand on it's own. It is a clean looking sturdy and versatile backpack that can hold a lot!!! I recently traveled with this as my personal item / carry on and it held all my gadgets which were easily accessible on the plane because the opening opens so nicely. I easily had 30 lbs of items including my extra large and heavy laptop. Additionally the strap for luggage attachment worked excellently. Once at my destination this backpack converted nicely to hold all of my camera gear lenses and drone. I highly recommend this item.
5,I like to use back packs when traveling to keep my hands free and prevent shoulder pain with arm bags. I dislike regular back packs that have no stability where everything gets messy and piles up at the bottom of the bag and doesn't sit upright. This back pack solves those problems. It stands upright no matter what. I don't really plan to use this to carry a laptop but can confirm that it fits a 15". It's a pretty decent size to hold a bunch of items that you want to take on a plane with you and stays organized. Love all the zipper compartments and the bluegray color. It's comfortable to wear without hurting my back. Definitely a must have for travel.
5,My bag survived 3 plane rides over stuffing the over bin and under the seats all within 16 hours to Hawaii. If I have to use this as a school bag you definitely know I will.I have stuffed a thing of huggie wipes 10 diapers 2 water bottles on one side a thick binder 2 things of clothes laptop charging cords for laptop phone and tablets mouse camera everything I needed for a trip.
4,Love this backpack. I frequently use it on the weekends and love using it at the airport- the luggage strap is perfect for convenience. Only downfall is the way the mouth of the bag opens. It can be a little awkward to open and seems fragile like the mouth if bag will break especially when its packed full which it frequently is. Overall I've had this bag for over a year and no tears yet! The zipper is still strong despite feeling like it'll break! And I love all the pockets! There's plenty of space for work materials or a relaxing outing.  Overall I love this bag and would purchase again.
5,Very sturdy good for traveling when adding additional items with laptop so can be carried all in one bag.
4,I purchased this for free "personal item" on Spirit Air. All my other backpacks were too large for their size restrictions. I ordered this because it was waterproof and there was a strong chance of rain. It didn't rain but a water bottle did spill and everything inside was kept dry. The size fit perfectly under the seat. I love the opening because it made it easy to pack. I only rated 4 stars because the strap adjusters rubbed my arms and were a bit uncomfortable. But overall it was a GREAT find. I am now using it every day. I highly recommend.
5,I am a teacher and use this to hold my laptop and papers/binders. It holds a lot and is very durable so far. I have used it everyday for several months now. It still is in like new condition. I pick this one because I liked the size of the beverage holder on the sides because I take a bigger water bottle to school and other backpacks did not seem to have the pockets that would fit a normal size bottle. I definitely would recommend this to anyone.
5,Beautiful!!! Spacious!!! Comfortable straps!!!  I bought the mint green one and love the color.  Absolutely love this bag!!!  The zippers are a little rough so I’ll probably slide a white candle on the zippers to make it glide easier.
5,Have only had the product for 3 months but it’s worked wonders. I work two jobs consecutively so I needed a convenient way to pack all my necessary items for the day. I love that this backpack has a laptop compartment. Sleek design with lots of pockets for organizing. The water bottle pockets also stretch quite a bit and manage to fit my bigger reusable water bottles. Even with all the weight I keep in the backpack it’s managed to stay sturdy and durable. Would definitely recommend.
5,This backpack is PERFECT. I used it to travel around Paris and London for 10 days and it’s still in excellent condition. The features are amazing: the strap on the back to slide onto a carryon suitcase is the Best feature! (I have a hurt back and it makes walking around with it on a 4 wheel suitcase such a breeze)It fits so much. And has an easy carry handle laptop compartment and several different internal and external pockets. I’m obsessed! Especially for this price 🙌🏽 The ratings didn’t lie. I highly recommend and got so many compliments!
4,Love it! So easy and accessible - the reinforcements around the main compartment’s zipper makes a huge difference. The capacity is great. I might ask for one more big pocket to help keep thing organized but overall this is fantastic! Helps with back pain so much! I used to have an aching back from carrying half the load that I carry with this thing - still get achy every now and then but not nearly as much!
4,This bag is great. Only thing I don’t like it is that it smells like plastic when you open it. I put some essential oil on a Kleenex and put one or two in every compartment.  I left it that way for two weeks.  Mainly because I didn’t need it as of yet. The smell hasn’t come back after I used it for my disaster deployment with the Red Cross. One lady even liked it when I was deployed and was going to order one for her.
5,Material workmanship and functionality on this bag is fantastic! I use it for both work and travel. It is water resistant outside and the lining inside has padded shoulder straps and durable zippers. Work: Multiple pockets for organizing tech pocket padded laptop / file sleeve side pockets for water bottle(s) wide framed opening for viewing and packing. Travel: It fits 2 small / 1 medium size packing cubes and toiletries. Enough stuff for a 5+ day trip! It will also fit under the seat on a plane too! It's not a lightweight bag but very functional which is best in my opinion.
5,I love this bag!  It's the perfect teacher bag -- comfy straps big pockets and the main compartment fits my very large MacBook.  I can put a cold drink in the outside side pocket and the sweat doesn't soak through.  I was so tired of carrying multiple bags to work and now I simply grab this backpack and I'm good to go.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This backpack is wonderful out of my expectation! I love its fashion look and style! The quality seems great. It has a large capacity with a compartment inside it which can protect your laptop well and it's easy to organize your things. It has SO many pockets it expands to hold many extra items. Great for travelingI used this on a business trip. I had to take a lot of computer equipment / accessories. It held up very well. Very sturdy strapsand overall very high quality. Love the bag and would recommend for business/travel/college！！！
5,I purchased this recently to travel to Europe. I have used several different “personal item” bags for my trips but I loved this backpack!  All the pockets and compartments made keeping my items organized easy. I loved the way the large main pocket opens which allows larger items to easily be taken in and out. It was also very comfortable to wear. I love the look of it and so far it seems to be very durable. The price is amazing for the product. Very happy with my purchase!
5,Perfect for a lot of bigger items. I looked at so many backpacks and any my daughter liked the dimensions were too small to fit her LARGE zipper binder. She loves that this not only fits everything but also opens in a way it is easy to load up with out a struggle. It is very stylish and I think the style is not something she will outgrow anytime soon. I like it as an adult. Seems sturdy and she says it's comfortable.
5,I am a nurse and I bought this bag for work. This bag is perfect! There's plenty of room for my stuff and I love that there are water bottle pouches on the side.
5,Perfect work backpack. Working from home some and this was a great purchase for me to carry my laptop and work with me. This is much easier than a bulky briefcase style bag I had. But I think my favorite part is the closure. Very sturdy with wire that opens and forms a rectangle. Very well made and stylish for the price!
5,Got this backpack to carry my things to work (lunch purse etc). I specifically wanted a wide open top and a little structure. I like the cell phone pocket on the front keeps my phone from getting lost in the bag and there is plenty of storage. I look forward to using this bag when travelling as well!
5,My favorite part is how wide it opens. There are SO many compartments with nice zippers. The padding on the straps is very comfortable. I honestly can’t find one thing I dislike about this product. Oh and it shipped in a timely manner as well.
4,Looked just like the photos had a bunch of pockets as promised and opened up in that nice boxy way. Tested it during rainy days and my laptop was dry. Bottle holders can handle a large boba cup. The only problem is that the bag keeps falling forward when placed down unless the main compartment is 60% full to even it out. That's a problem when I have nothing but my laptop and pens in there.
5,Great backpack durable compact with many pockets. Love it!
5,Bought for my daughter who is a 3K teacher. Very durable and holds up. She has been using it for several months now and loves it. She had to have a heavy duty one that would hold up for a laptop and books...this works great!! I had bought her another bag and it was made cheap. This one is sturdy and is wonderful because it is also freestanding and doesn't fall over.  The quality of this one is great for the price paid and i recommend.
4,I ordered this backpack for a trip to carry some of my stuff and my 3 year old's. Fits underneath an airplane seat nicely. Very roomy in the bag and you can fit a lot of stuff in there.  So it is perfect for moms when traveling with a little toddler.  The backpack was thicker than I expected however that means it is well padded all around. The backpack is easy to carry and the straps are wide enough that they don't hurt your shoulder even though you're carrying it longer.
5,I have the HapTim diaper bag for over a year now and it’s been fantastic. So when I needed to replace my purse backpack I thought I’d give it a try. It fits everything and more (even two diapers& wipes) without becoming big and bulky.For the price you really can’t get anything better!
5,This bag is fantastic! I fly a lot for work and this is the perfect carry on personal item backpack  with a clean look that allows it to be my work bag once I get to my location. I had a similar one by Kroser that I completely wore out over about a year and this was my replacement purchase.  All my dislikes from the other bag are taken care of with this one. This has a roomy interior lots of pockets a luggage strap and stretchy water bottle pockets. Highly recommend!
5,Husband and I went on a 2.5 week honeymoon. 6 countries 11 cities...4 planes 3 trains a people mover city buses and multiple uber's later....I can say this is the absolute best bag. I love the way it stays pretty square inside which allows you to pack things into it really nice and organized.  The top is so incredibly convenient when maneuvering in small spaces and good lord...the amount of pockets... it's just phenomenal. Quality is great. Literally looking for an excuse to use this bag again. 😍
5,I bought this to go to Universal Studios and it was perfect! It was the right size to take on the plane and into the park. The various pockets kept everything organized. It’s a great bag and it looks great too! Love!
5,The first one was for my 14 year old son to tote schoolbooks.  The second one was for my daughter who is using it to transport books and a computer around her college campus.  I like how the top opens up wide making it easy to place books and a laptop inside. The top strap makes it easy to pick up.  These backpacks have not been given the test of time yet so I cannot comment on durability.  They seem well made with a tough fabric.
5,Got it for my daughter for school! 8th grade- she loves it. Lots of room for everything including her laptop.
5,I have an older/larger laptop and it fits! I have been able to use it for school.  I am able to fit a laptop 1.5" binder 3 notebooks 2 textbooks charging cables and a tablet all in the main compartment. I love the wide mount opening of the big compartment.
5,I purchased this backpack for an upcoming trip to Alaska and I must say I am very pleased with the size and quality and it is very stylish with many storage areas. It will easily fit my laptop camera binoculars clothes water bottles umbrella etc. Also has a strap so you can put it over your luggage handle. I haven't actually used it yet so can't attest to water resistance and durability but am looking forward to using it for my trip.
5,It’s attractive yet looks professional. I hope it will hold up but it has not been exposed to much since I began working from home.I really like that the main compartment opens wide and stays open making it easy to load unload and look for things. Although it would be nice if one of the front pockets was full-sized.
5,I love the look and practicality of this backpack!There is one main compartment that opens at the top and lets you see everything inside. The zippers have a large enough opening that you can slide a luggage lock through.It has the ability to slide it over a suitcase if I don't feel like wearing it. This may be my most favorite feature for traveling. An added bonus are the handles at the top that snap together.The seam stitching is a little messy at the front top pocket but it's not a deal breaker for me.
5,Overall we like the look the feel and the color. The zippers are good and the bag is holding it’s shape well after a couple months of use.We purchased this bag for our teen daughter to tote her many art supplies around in. She’s traveled with it a few times and far it’s holding up well.It’s a very nice bag and I’m considering getting another one for myself.
5,I bought this bag to safely hold my laptop and to evenly distribute weight between my shoulders - as my single shoulder bag was causing a lot of neck pain. I love this bag. I now take it on flights and it holds everything I need with extra room fits easily under the seat in front of me and has this awesome strap that allows me to stick it on my luggage.My favorite thing about it is that it has lots of little compartments and pockets for organizing all my stuff. Highly recommend!
5,There is plenty of room in this backpack for my laptop my planner and more! It’s well made. No complaints!
5,I LOVE this bag! It is SO spacious. I get a love of compliments on it. It has good pockets. The zippers seem durable and good quality. I’ve had it about 3 months and use it almost daily.
4,I love it! I just got the product and so far Im loving it. Im gonna use it as my work bag. It has a lot of compartments to organize my stuff well. Im not sure about the durability cause I just got it but the material looks good.
5,I like all the pockets
5,Perfect nurse bag. This bag fits everything plus lunch. Side pockets hold water bottle one one aide coffee cup on the other. I have gotten so many compliments on this bag
5,I love this bag... I use it for a work bag I’m a full time breast feeding mom so I was looking for a bag that I can pack my pump and all of my other items that I take to work and to minimize the amount of bags I carry to work... this bag is perfect and very durable. I highly recommend this bag.
5,This is the most amazing bag I have ever owned. I wish I had one for high school/college.It opens up VERY wide to fit so much: lunch box books notebooks etc. Two "laptop" spaces. Great side pockets that expand to fit a LARGE water bottle. Other pockets that are easy to access and fit a lot.I guess a downfall would be that the straps are a little thin but honestly I am being picky.MUST BUY!
5,Really great backpack! HUGE bargain on price! At first I was thinking this backpack was too big but when it came in the size was perfect! I use it to carry my work laptop agenda books water bottles and everything in between. Nice design and has lots of pockets!
5,I love everything about this backpack! I've been searching for a while for the perfect work travel and weekender bag and this is it. So far I've gone on a 4 day trip and fit all of my things perfectly. All of the exterior pockets have alot of flex and can fit bulker items with ease. The giant middle compartment is very roomy and also easy to grab stuff out of. Love love love
5,I bought this for school bc I am a teacher and I have been using a laptop since the pandemic. It is awesome it holds everything you would need and has several different pockets. I am a female and it would easily hold purse items too .
5,I bought two one for me and one for my husband; we used them for a two week trip to Europe in September.  These were exactly what we needed.  They hold a lot of "stuff" including laptops/I-pads cell phones extra clothes water bottles etc.  They are sturdy and comfortable. I even carried it in front of me to minimize the risk of theft and it was comfortable to use in this way.  Love this bag!
5,The color of the product is different in reality than in the photo !!  Turquoise is not a bright color it is closer to gray. And so the capacity of the backpack is good comfortable on the road.
5,I am a college professor. I use this bag every day and I love it. Easy to access pockets. I have dropped it several times and it has protected my laptop well. I love the stand-up feature (though it will slouch from time to time). And I really like the “doctor’s bag” opening at the top. I will never buy a backpack with a regular opening again. I took this as my carry-on for a trip across country. It was excellent!
5,I got this backpack in today and so far so good!  The zippers are nice and not cheaply made there is plenty of room for all the things and the color of the backpack is just like the photo on Amazon! I’m hoping it wears well and lasts for a while!
5,This bag is awesome. Has a bunch of pockets for organized people. It's also surprisingly large. It can fit my work laptop planner and notebook and there's still plenty of space if I want to carry more books. In the smaller pockets I carry my wallet phone chargers pens a smaller notebook small make-up bag laptop charger and headphone case. The side pockets are also great. It can fit my 32 oz water bottle which was a problem with all my previous backpacks. This one can actually fit a good size water bottle.
5,I wanted a professional looking backpack to carry to work. This one is fabulous! Lots of pockets and compartments and the water bottle holders are large. Perfect!
5,Amazing quality on this bag. It's probably the roomiest bag I've ever seen. The quality is outstanding especially for the price. It has many pockets and zippers. We bought them for operation backpack that helps kids in need with school supplies. ALL of the supplies fit and there was plenty of room leftover.
4,Ok. Let's be honest. For the price I wasn't expecting much. But I am surprised. The bag quality is amazing. It is very roomy. I fit my ipad daytimer and day to day necessities. It stands on its own and the top pocket is wide and stays open. Lots of room for two water bottles on the pouch on the sides. Lots of great pockets on the outside. The straps are padded and comfy.I'm not sure how waterproof it is but at this point it isn't a deal breaker. I really like this bag and would recommend it!
5,Love this bag the pockets make it easy to organize everything. It’s amazing especially for zoo trips with my 4 year old.
5,This bag is a smaller backpack that I use as my personal item on airplanes.  It is just large enough to carry every thing I need (my goal is to stop over packing). You will not be able to stuff this the way you would the traditional backpack because of the doctor bag type opening. I have not have the opportunity to discover it the bag is truly water resistant yet. Please remember that something being water resistant is different than something that is waterproof.
5,I work in school's and this bag has been great to throw my laptop iPad and any folders or other things in. Lots of space! It is durable while also sleek enough to look professional. There are tons of pockets and storage. So far I have no complaints!
5,It’s pretty big which is what I needed because my textbooks are huge. And I like that I can put my laptop in there comfortably. There is plenty of room for more and it’s really pretty too. It has enough pockets for all my little extra stuff and the side pockets are roomy. I could definitely fit a water bottle on each side with a full bag. The material feels nice and strong. Would definitely recommend if you need something with a lot of space.
5,This is the first time I used a backpack for air travel; in the past I have always carried some sort of tote with all my in-air needs.  What a difference it made in the comfort of my arms.  I love that it has so many pockets and places to put all my stuff safely.  Just have to remember where everything is...  Can't speak yet to water resistance and durability but so far I have no complaints.
5,A great bag for a reasonable price.  I like the stay-open "doctor's bag" main zippered compartment and the light colored lining which help you to find items inside.  Water repellent side bottle holders luggage strap magnet closing front pocket inside key fob clip interior padded sleeves and useful zippered compartments.
4,The bottom button doesn't work at all and the top wires broke like when your bra wire pops out but the inside is nice and it fits my laptop and textbooks nicely.
5,I got this bag becsuse it has multiple pockets but never expect to be very spacious. Also there's a hidden wire frame at at the zipper for the large compartment which i like the most. The frame helps distribute the eeight evenly and keeps the bag in shape.
4,Just got it yesterday so I don’t know yet how it will hold up. It has a large capacity since it sort of opens like a long upright rectangle. I’m hoping it’s not too cumbersome to wear while I take day trips while traveling this summer. Good for the plane though. We shall see!!
5,I saw a friend with this backpack who said it was great for traveling for work. I thought I'd like it ok I absolutely love it. It's more compact than my last bag but has a lot more room and practical pockets and slots. My work laptop fits in the laptop pocket while my work planner fits in the other slot. Allowing for ample room in between. And that's just the main pocket.
5,I had not herd of Hap Tim and the price seemed too good so I was a little skeptical.  I was wrong great backpack!  Holds everything perfectly.  Slim profile looks nice.  I have received many compliments and questions.  You cannot beat the price.  Highly recommend.  I use is for everyday work and as a weekend bag or small trip bag.
5,It looks nice has lots of pockets opens on the top and was reasonably priced
5,Best backpack I've ever owned. I'm so happy with how much easier this bag makes traveling for me. Fits so perfectly on my suitcase. The flat bottom in addition to the back strap help hold it securely in place. Love the handles on top for added support while on the suitcase. Back padding is good. Wide top opening is great. Perfect amount and size of additional pockets with closures. I honestly don't have anything negative to say. 🤷🏼‍♀️
5,I love this bag!! It fits my huge medic textbook plenty of folders my laptop and has plenty of compartments for other stuff. The pink and blue looks really nice. I was a little unsure after ordering it but it really is a great backpack! Happy with this purchase
4,I just got this but positive first impression. It’s roomy. Has nice amount of pockets and fits well on my back. Doesn’t look expensive or cheap for that that matter. It will serve its purpose as a laptop bag to follow me back and forth to work with every day. Nice upgrade from the old-school padded shoulder strap horizontal laptop bag I had before.If I do not update this review in the near future then you can assume that it passes the quality / duration test.
5,Exactly as pictured and holds so much stuff. This is a killer travel backpack or great for every day use.
5,The laptop compartment is tucked in the back and keeps your laptop snug. The middle of the bag is a wide open space. The bag is just the right size to count as your personal item when traveling. It’s roomy and holds a lot. It’s got straps so fits over a luggage handle easy. I’ve gotten complements on this bag. Love it!
5,The bag is perfect for travel. For the airplane it held my laptop kindle chargers. Lysol wipes gum snacks...and so many pockets but not too many. Things that can be improved... the luggage strap is too low and makes it top heavy when on the carryon. I used the top handles over the carry on and that helped. Beautiful  durable bag.
5,I've used this backpack for 2 semesters in college. It still looks like new and will be used for my next semester. Every day I carried 15" laptop iPad pro 12.9 a plastic paper case for A4 size 20 oz Hydro flask bottle an umbrella gadgets(Bluetooth mouse keyboard cables charging block earphone) writing supplies toiletries and more. I had space left even after adding a thick textbook and a portfolio folder. Still the backpack maintained its shape with all these stuff in it. I highly recommend this backpack.
5,This bag is sturdy water resistant and it opens wide so it is not difficult to retrieve smaller things at the bottom. The pockets on the side are awesome you can carry a water bottle on each side. There are plenty of compartments and a little slot to easily retract a charging cord out of the side. A+ great bag lots of pockets ability to secure a laptop of tablet within it and it doesn't take much room inside. I'd buy this bag again!
5,I've been looking for a backpack for months now that fulfills a few of my biggest requirements and this is the holy grail! My criteria:- Looks professional for work- Has plenty of interior storage- Can fit a standard laptop- Has outside pockets that can hold a 20 oz reusable water bottle/coffee travel mug- Has plenty of organizational pockets inside/outside that are easily accessible- Comfortable and low-profile designThis bag checks all the boxes!
5,Love the square opening for packing. Used for weekend trip fits decent under plane seat lots of nice compartments. Looks clean and classy for a "back-pack." No questions asked by security for size to bring as a "personal" free carry on.
5,I absolutely love this backpack the quality is great. I carry my computer and so many things and it still feels light . Definitely made a great choice when I pick this one . Recommend 100%
5,This is the best backup I’ve ever had! It’s spacious beautiful durable actually repeals water & efficient. I love it and recommend it. I use it for work to carry my laptop and other things and I’m constantly getting compliments and being asked where I got it. I’ve referred several other buyers! I will buy another color soon!
4,Love this bag very roomy and super cute. I used it as a carry on and was able to keep it under my seat worked great very comfortable to wear and kept all my stuff organized.
5,This is such a great bag love the toughness of the material and What I really LOVE is that it has lots of compartments. I used the bag for a vacation on a flight as a carry-on and it was not bulky and I really packed it with stuff. Great quality material. Very spacious very lightweight and chic. I like that it has a strap to hold on a suitcase and also to hold the shoulder straps. I appreciate that they really pay attention to the customers needs. I really recommend this bag and give it 5 stars.
4,I love this backpack. I needed a new backpack for school that I could also use in the workplace. The water resistance is great because it rains a lot where I live. The laptop compartment is great and doesn't take up as much room as my laptop sleeve did. The only negative thing about the backpack is that it is a little heavier than what I'm used to but I'll get used to it.
5,This backpack is being used for school but would make a great travel backpack as well. It's very spacious and has a very wide opening across the top of the pack.  It appears to be very sturdy and well made.  The snap on the front looks a little like a flower and I was afraid my son would think it was a girl's backpack but he didn't notice and took it to school without any concerns!
5,I bought this for work travel and it is perfect! Between the wide mouth opening and all the zippered pockets I couldn't ask for anything more. My laptop is snug and it fits my lunch bag purse and notebooks. I'm hands free. Good cushioning for back comfort. Nice big side pockets with elastic for water bottles etc. Everyone loves it when they see it. I am very impressed and would not hesitate to recommend it.
3,Bought this backpack during summer for school in the fall. I'm a medical college student so I needed something that could withhold heavy text books and a laptop which it does great! The issue I have is the small front top pocket. A week after using it and a week after my return window the zipper separated from the faberic which does not allow you to unzip the zipper. I had to mess with it for a long while to get it to open again. And now I cannot return it or exchange it. This pocket was perfect for my cellphone and wallet  but guess it will be useless space from now on. Something to consider when buying zippers are crap. I'd also like to note that this isnt a pocket I would open and close often so I wasn't over using it either in the week that I had used it.
5,Awesome backpack! I used it for airport travel and a  road trip and it was perfect for both! I got countless compliments too! It has a huge capacity and the opening makes it easy to find things. Many pockets and I love the side pockets for water bottles.***note there is a strong plastic smell that comes from it when you first get it. I let it air out a while before using it and sprayed fabreeze.
5,I bought this before I moved to Germany because I needed something stylish waterproof and lightweight.  Check on all three. I spent several hours in Seattle and in Germany in the steady rain. Not a drip inside. I rise my bike everywhere and it is comfortable and easy to have on my back as I travel around on my bike.  I highly recommend.
5,I've used this on domestic and international flights as well as normal day to day activities. I love it. It's great for travel just don't overload it or itdoesn't fit very well on your roller bag handle. I'm able to get my 17" laptop in with a few extra items if I don't put it in the padded sleeve.
5,I needed a new backpack that I could use everyday for work.  I'm on the smaller side (5'4") and honestly it's a little bigger than I would've liked for everyday but it double duties as a great travel backpack so overall I love it.  It can fit so much and has so many pockets to keep everything organized.  It's my go to for weekend trip and as my personal item on flights.  Great buy for the price!
5,I’ve been using this bag for about two months now at college and it’s held up pretty well. The only thing is that the Velcro that holds the laptop compartment shut is starting not to stick anymore.  It’s also waterproof EXCEPT where the zippers are. Water leaks in and can get stuff wet. This is kind of disappointing because otherwise this would be the perfect backpack.
5,I love this back pack so much.  All the pockets and design elements just make sense for me.  I use it for work but recently took it on a trip abroad and it AMAZING so much room and the doctor bag opening along with the treads on the bottom allow it to stay upright which I LOVE ! The material is great too—well made and doesn’t look cheap.
5,Ordered it on Dec 26 and I got it on Jan 7. It was alot bigger than I expected but im actually glad since it fits my huge Med-Surg Nursing book binder hesi book and drug book with plenty of room for my 13" laptop and more. Comfortable on the back and doesnt feel too heavy. The material is nice and thick. A few loose stitch work here and there but nothing major. Overall im happy with it... I'll follow-up with an update review after I've clocked some miles on it.
5,This bag is great! Lots of space due to the hinges opening. I get lots of compliments from others on how professional it looks. The adjustable laptop space is convenient and it has so many pockets. The only thing to be aware of is that the bag when empty still has some weight to it due to the metal hinge top and thick material.  Not a problem for me but if you have a lot of heavy stuff in it that might be heavier than you expect. It is perfect for a carry-on bag too.
1,I did not even get to take this bag out of its packaging.  It arrived in taped up plastic that had condensation on the inside. Upon opening the plastic packaging further the item was wet covered in mold.  I had ordered two different bags that arrived in separate boxes. Only this bag arrived wet and covered in mold.  I have returned this bag but it is unacceptable to ship an item that is covered in mold.
5,I bought this for my new job where I have to walk a few blocks from where I park to my office building. This is a great backpack. It looks professional (I’m in my 40’s) and holds a lot. I love all the outside pockets and the interior ones too. The bonus that it has a wide opening is great for when I have to pack binders home with me. It rains a lot where I live and it really is water resistant but I generally use an umbrella too.
5,I ordered several backpacks to try and this was the winner-holds plenty-big enough laptop section for my big MacBook still will fit a pair of shoes and food and pretty much anything else I want to carry.  Zippers are good quality lots of small areas for organization.  Perfect bag.  It also will be great for travel.  Held up to the rain in Salem OR on my walking commute.  Actually cannot think of anything I would change.
5,Great quality for a great price. I love this bag! Way more space than I thought. I can even fit my Nikon SLR with lens in the front zipper pocket (just camera-not in case) for easier access while I travel. There are plenty of pockets. My only dislike is the pocket for a laptop as I won’t be using it but it isn’t in the way like some other bags and it provides a little extra padding on the back. May return so I can get the blue grey color instead.
5,The notebook compartment is nice this backpack packs so much (office binders etc.) and is perfectly sized and designed to make the best of the small bag. All pockets are placed well and the main chamber has no internal protruding pockets or dividers  loading binders is easy. Keychain is always a good thing.Cons:There are 2 pen holders only.It is difficult to close the top zipper with one hand  when fully open.
5,This backpack was easy to pack and carry  I enjoyed using it on my last trip.  It fit under the seat on the plane.
5,So I've waited over a month to leave a review because I wanted to make sure that I really enjoyed this bag and I can now say confidently that I do! I went back to school this fall and this backpack has been great for all of my college textbooks and computer. I have four different textbooks my computer and a few notebooks along with pens and pencils and there is still room for more. I've even had a bottle of water accidentally knocked over on it and the water just beaded up and rolled off!
5,This bag fits everything it has tons of space. Stylish and good price.
5,I have been searching for a "dr. style" bag for months.  I had ordered and returned one from Amazon and another from a local store.  This is the best by far.  The quality of the zippers and overall material is very good.  It looks very nice and is perfect for my business travel.  I highly recommend this bag is this is the style you are looking for.
5,I'm impressed with the great quality of this backpack and the space it has! It is extremely useful with all of the extra zippers and it's a very nice backpack.
5,I loved this backpack instantly. I'm an artist and there is more than enough room for me to fit sketchbooks of different sizes my supply pouch and a few other bigger palettes. My 15.6 inch laptop fits in the sleeve for when i need to take my homework with me. It is sturdily constructed and nicely designed. There are two different bottle holders one for my paint water bottle and the other for my drinking water. I just....really seriously love this backpack.
5,Something I never realized how bad I needed. I am a traveling teacher and this back pack is so convenient. Everything fits! My laptop my gradebook planner paleres to grade & graded papers. All my pen! Two drink holders glasses mouse and even my snacks. Best thing I've ever purchased
5,I just bought this and have been using for about a week but love it so far. My laptop fits perfect and I love how the top opens wide to be able to find all contents of the bag. So many great pockets very practical! I also have this backpack in the diaper bag version and love it!!
5,Bought for my staff and put my office logo on them! Turned out great and all love them!
5,I have been using this backpack daily for several months I love it.  I especially love the design pockets and the opening is super wide.  Easy to use!
5,I have brought this backpack with me to clinicals since January 2019. Nearly 11 months later this backpack is still sturdy and works amazing holding my several medical textbooks. The straps have remained stitched tight and is still relatively comfortable despite the heavy weigt I'm carrying. I get compliments on the look and it holds all that I need & more!
5,I am very happy so far. The laptop fits securely into it's slot with a flap that holds it in place. With the "doctor bag" opening at the top I can easily slip in at least two baskets of papers with room to spare. Additional pockets for wristlet wallet cell phone all chargers pens etc. The design is clean and sharp.I would recommend this bag to a friend.  As for the bag's durability I will report in at the end of the school year.
5,This is a nice bag. Looks sharp. I usually like to put my computer a tablet zipper bag of charges my cross body purse and a jacket inside which is a a bit snug. But it's a perfect fit for travel or school. I carry a tervis water bottle and a pop babies blender in the side pockets. The or front pockets are roomy also and keeps me organized.
5,I LOVE this backpack. I am a teacher and always need something that is durable and roomy! This backpack definitely has plenty of room. It is comfortable to wear and the nylon material makes it pretty durable.
5,Excelente tela fortaleza en los brazos y resistente. Me encanta!
5,I love this bag for work and travel
5,This bag exceeded my expectations! It is a lot roomier than I had anticipated and it looks great. Very happy with this bag!
5,Love this backpack. It’s perfect size. Use it as a diaper bag for two kids. I’m very organized and find this so perfect; from two water bottle holders on the sides to all the little pockets. Excellent customer service.
5,I bought this to replace my run-of-the-mill backpack in an effort to make more space for my lunchbox and laptop.  I commute via the train so I like to keep everything in one spot instead of lugging around various bags.This was exactly what I was looking for! There are many more pockets/compartments than I had realized.  The top opens up wide so that I can see what's in the bag with my eyes and not my hands.
5,I currently use this backpack for work. Holds everything I need it too plus is very water resistant.
5,Had no problems with delivery and it was well packaged. Fits my laptop and fits in everything I need for work. Does keep items dry inside when it rains.
5,I love this backpack. I’m an ESL teacher supporting two schools and thus I move about often. This backpack has allowed me to carry everything I need wherever I go and not strain my shoulders like my other “teacher bags” have done in the past. It’s durable water glides off it in the rain it’s functional and attractive. Great purchase!
5,I love this bag.  I had one that was styled similarly but not as large and not as well made.  This bag is durable well-thought out with plenty (and I mean plenty) of room for everything you might want to have with you on the plane -- laptop magazines a sweater electronic gear neck pillow (yes it will fit IN the bag) PLUS everything you might regularly carry in your purse/handbag.
5,We bought this is use as a diaper bag for our newborn and toddler. It’s been great so far! Love the handles and the backpack straps both come in handy. We travel a lot as well so the luggage strap was a must as well. Nice size pockets for what we need. Fits our water bottles nicely too. Overall very happy with this product!
5,Great laptop backpack! Seems to be waterproof wipes off easily and expands for a ton of room inside! Definitely a good low cost option to keep your computer and accessories stored and safe. Would definitely recommend!
5,I am a teacher and I purchased this to use as my teacher bag. I wanted something that could fit a laptop if necessary plus a few books and a binder or two. I love all the pockets for pens and other personal items. The quality of the material seems really durable. I've only had it for a few days but so far so good!
5,I chose this bag for work and it is great to balance out m heavy bag and very roomy
5,This backpack has lots of pockets and plenty of room for everything I wanted to put in it. I just used it on vacation and even fully loaded it fits under the airplane seat just fine. I was hesitant to order the blue grey color but like other reviewers noted it isn't actually blue at all. It's just a slightly darker grey so I'm glad I got that color!
3,Unfortunately the the strap that is supposed to fit/ slid over the luggage handle is to small and doesn’t stretch.  The lovely cup holder on the side is elastic.  The strap on the back should also be made of this.  The rest of the back pack is great.  However I bought it to slid over the luggage hand and it’s too small.
5,Seriously fit so much in here. I am impressed by the space the pockets and the quality of the material. Fit under the plane seat and held 5 days of lite outfits shoes and hair tools etc. great buy!
5,This backpack looks professional while being spacious and functional as well. The material is very durable and can withstand heavy rain. This backpack can also fit a lot and has many pockets for organization. The pockets for water bottles easily hold my 32 oz hydro. High quality backpack for the price.
5,I got this for travelling and I see it as being very handy. I do wish they had it in black but dark grey is not so bad. I love that it's wide open so it gives me a lot of room. It stands up on it's own without any assistance. I would've liked it more if the strap in the back for suitcase handle was a little more wide.
5,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price point. The bag fabric is waterproof and strong It is very roomy and does fit my 15.6 laptop. There are many outer pockets well designed for storing power bank cords charger and other relevant device. Everything were staying on their own places. These outer pockets are for quick access and very helpful i don't need to dig out my small private things from bottom of bag. I Love it a lot !!
5,Lots of room love the color (as expected) water resistant wish there were at least on more compartment in large part of backpack
5,I love this backpack. The are many pockets and plenty of space. It fits my 17” laptop even though it states 15”. This bag exceeded my expectations. I work remotely often and prefer to use a backpack to haul all of my stuff. I have been using this for 3 months so far and have 0 complaints.
5,Love this backpack! Use it for work. Holds a ton lots of pockets. Really durable and so nice!
5,Great size. I like that the side pockets are a good size to fit my coffee thermos. There are good number of pockets. The laptop part is out of the way and I can keep my notebooks in the opposite pocket leaving a nice amount of room in the center for my shoes.
2,I wanted something with easy to open/close compartments (i.e. one-handed operation easy to shove a laptop and files into and store small accessories like chargers/cables in the style of a backpack and not a messenger bag.This bag does fine as far as holding everything I need it to hold. The problem is that the style of the zippers and shape of the compartments make two-handed operation a requirement and can be quite frustrating to use. The metal wire frame around the main opening does not add functionality but makes it difficult to open/close the main zipper without firmly holding the end of the zipper.Also there's a convenient pocket for throwing some files into but there's no stiffness in this part of the bag so the bag will fold over on itself and bend your files. Also forget about just leaning it up against something as you sit down to work. The bag will fall over on itself every time due to just the odd shape of it.Wish I didn't have to waste my money experimenting with yet another bag. One day I'll find one that just works.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this bag!!! I bought this for a bag to take along on a trip. It fit everything I wanted in it for the plane ride. It fit under the seat. It fit many things plus my iPad and 2 other tablets. Very comfortable for a back pack and can carry it as a regular bag with the nice handles. I’m thinking about buying another just to have.
5,We have been searching for a backpack! My 13 year old didn’t want the athletic brand types as she likes to be more fashionable. She carries around binders and a chrome book.  We couldn’t find anything to fit it all until I finally came across this beauty.  And the price is great!  I never write reviews!
5,Bought this for myself for work. It has so much room and very durable and stylish.
5,Me encanta es cómoda! Es espaciosa como lo indica en el vídeo! Resistente al agua y se amolda muy bien a los hombro y espalda
5,Bought this bag for my wife for her work and travel. She loves it. Loves all the pockets to organize all of her things.
4,I was looking for a pack with a wide and deep base which was difficult. This back pack met what I needed. Only 4 stars because the shoulder straps could be more comfortable. Hopefully breaking it in will make the comfort level a bit better.
5,Perfect commuter back pack. Large interior(maybe too big for some folks) well padded laptop storage nice arrangement of exterior pockets. Very sturdy after 6 mos of almost daily use.  Not waterproof but good water resistance. It's fairly large overall so probably not well suited for small framed people.
4,Wonderful bag! It does hurt my shoulders sometimes due to how heavy the items I have in it are. I usually carry a chromebook a 5 subject notebook a small textbook and small medication bag. It has lots of room
5,Love the size if there’s not much in it it goes flat but it has the ability to expand to fit a change of clothes water snacks  laptop which is exactly what I needed plus the stars are very padded and comfortable ...
5,I use this for traveling between home and office it’s enough room for laptop paperwork lunch spare sweater with room to spare.
5,Love this backpack I get lots of compliments. It has many compartments for everything and the laptop section is sizable to your needs so it's really the perfect backpack. I took it on an international trip as well as a carry on and it was allowed as an under the seat carry on so there's that in case anyone was needing that info.
5,Love this bag. It stands upright and the main compartment opens wide and doesn't require assistance to stay open. Lots of places to put stuff and two generous sized side pockets for my yeti thermoses. Straps are strong and pack fits comfortably even when full
5,I never write reviews. However I love this back pack! I purchased it for a trip and it was perfect. It seemed small when it arrived  but it really has a lot of space. I love that it opens wide and has lots of functional pockets! Great bag!
5,I love this bag. I bought this to use for carrying my lunch and everything else I need to commute to work and back. It's the exact size I needed and when open is like a tall grocery sack. It has several pockets that are of different sizes for storing smaller items. The color and material is great while still being waterproof. Very happy with my purchase!
5,I loveee the flat squared bottom.  Never had that in a bag before and it is really convenient.  It is extremely waterproof and durable too.  For the price this is a great bag with tons of pockets and storage.  Highly recommend!
5,Awesome bag. Using it to bring laptop and work back and from the office to home. Im really pleased with this bag.  Lots of storage and pockets
4,Great backpack. Lots of smart storage stands up nicely on its own seems durable easy to to fasten onto other luggage. It is a little heavy on its own though. Small thing but if you need things to be as light as possible that is something to consider.
5,Awesome backpack roomy but not bulky. Very well made I’ve used daily for 2 months and looks brand new! Can’t go wrong for the price with this one!
5,Still looks just like new and I use it daily with much abuse. I have recommended this to all my friends and they love it as well. You won't regret this purchase!
5,It works as planned.I had a Krosser before and always ran out of space on my daily commute (involving a train and a bus).This bag has allowed me to now only carry one bag (this one) vs. 2 as I had with the KrosserLove it.
4,Love that it has so many compartments. As a teacher that teaches in two different rooms I have to carry many things so the different compartments are great.  However it is very heavy even with nothing in it making it even heavier once you put things in it.
5,I use this bag for work. It holds a TON!  Super durable.
5,The backpack is a nice color. It's perfect for college student's it's very spacey and has a lot of useful pockets. The material isn't cheap it's very durable. I can fit my laptop college textbooks my lunch and still have extra space. The straps are comfortable! It was a very great buy I don't regret it one bit.
1,I loved this backpack and took it on a trip overseas. However the zipper broke within days of my trip and it was not over packed at all.  I had my laptop a notebook and a wallet. I loved all the compartments the color and how it would stand open but was very disappointed in the quality of the zippers.
4,Really like the bag it was great on a 10 day trip it fit under the planes seat as advertised. the Velcro for the laptop is already fraying from 10 days of use. Not sure it’s as water resistant as it made it seem.
5,This back pack is very sturdy and all the zippers and snaps work correctly. It has many pockets and features. I don't know yet how water resistant it is yet but it's not any cheap type of material. Good quality for the price and very stylish.
5,Love this backpack. I am a personal trainer and was looking for a backpack for the gym that can be all my stuff and keep it organized. This worked out perfectly for me and it's very well made. Love it!
5,Very nice bag. A bag you can have organization in. Lots of room. Just what I was looking for.
5,I bought this for my daughter she loves it working in the medical field she carries her laptop water bottle.  She doesn't carry a purse when she uses this backpack so she loves the small pocket in the front.  It has lots of pockets and comfortable to wear on your back.  Would recommend this to anyone great purchase!
5,Nice looking backpack with plenty of pockets to be organized comfortable to carry on the back. Love it!
5,Love this backpack! Bought to travel back in forth from Texas to Cali. Roomy and so easy to look inside and find your junk!
5,Me encanta es exactamente como la describen tiene todos sus compartimientos es espaciosa y muy bonita. Mi laptop cupo bastante bien es muy comoda.
5,Looking for a backpack to haul my many meds purse items as well as laptop when traveling by plane. This is perfect. Sits flat on bottom and top opens wide and has a luggage sleeve to make hauling easier in airport. Will re-evaluate after our next travels.
5,Perfect for traveling
5,I used this backpack everyday for work. It is fantastic and holds a lot of stuff
5,I used this to go to San Diego. Worked perfectly as a personal bag for the flight. I absolutely love the different pockets. I felt that my computer was safe which was extremely important to me. I will continue to use this bag and when it wears out I will buy another. I definitely recommend this bag.
5,This is such a great backpack. I got it to travel it’s roomy durable and did I say cute!
5,Great backpack and great for travel with the luggage strap. I took it on a snorkel trip and it got wet on the speed boat. The inside didn’t seem to get wet but I’m not super confident it’s actually “water resistant”. Overall it’s a great backpack!
5,Perfect size for traveling for work with space for laptop and Ipad. Plenty of room for 2 day overnight stay. Plus it fits 2- 32oz Hydro Flasks. One on each side. Lots of smaller pockets for odds and ends... love it!!
5,I use this bag for school and will also use it for traveling in the future. I just love it so much. It's easy to carry either on my back or just holding it with my hands. I can fit all of my books and binder in it perfectly. I also love the way it opens its the whole reason I purchased this bag and it doesn't disappoint!
1,So disappointed. Ordered this as a gift for someone and it arrived with a food stain. An attempt was clearly made to clean the stain beforehand. It appears to be peanut butter which is even more frustrating as there are peanut allergies in the recipients household.
5,Great bag great size.
5,Just what I wanted! Great for nurses vet techs anyone really! SO much room!
5,I’m a nursing student and this bag is great for my books and equipment!
5,Great for organization. Working perfectly as a nurse working in a hospital!
5,I'm so glad I purchased this bag  has just the right amount of pockets  holds tons of my stuff  easy to carry.
5,I LOVE this backpack!!  I can fit my laptop lunch box book and other random things in it!  Love the little outside pocket for my work badge so I always know where it is!!
4,Everything about it is great and as described. It was actually larger hen I expected but it should fit under the plane seat which is what I need.
4,Great bag for traveling but it’s very bulky and stuff. I’m sure that will change over time but I wasn’t prepared for that. It was a pain in the airport but fit nicely under the seat. I could see it working for larger-framed people.
5,Love love love my backpack! Great quality! I use it as my work bag everyday.  So happy with this purchase.
5,I love being able to slide this bag over my suitcase handle. And it stands itself up which is nice even when there is a laptop in it.
2,After about a week the cute decorative piece fell off after about a month the magnet fell off and one of the handle strap came off within a couple months. My daughter is getting frustrated with this backpack as it was expected to last all school year. Hoping it doesn’t continue falling apart and losing pieces.
5,Worth the purchase!
5,Looks more like a briefcase because of the shape which is a plus since I use this for business. Very roomy with a number of outside pockets.  I get a lot of compliments.
5,Exactly like the picture! Although I knew the dimensions I thought it would come smaller since that's how things sometimes work on Amazon but I was pleased to see it is as pictured. It seems like the material will last a long time! I cant wait tonuse this for trips to the zoo soccer games traveling and as my work bag!
5,I am a traveling teacher and this backpack works great! I needed something that didn’t look “kid-ish” and had adequate storage. This bag meets all the criteria I was looking for. It’s sturdy has loads of pockets and an adjustable Velcro computer pouch. I’m obsessed! Great purchase for the price!
5,Very helpful for walking to work!
5,I bought this back back for my teenage daughter. She loves that the backpack opens at the top and not the front. Very durable multiple pockets. Definitely holds up to how many books she has to carry. This was a super buy!
4,I really love the look of this backpack and all the storage. Just curious if anyone else’s bag has this coloring on the stripes on the inside where the laptop sleeve is? The white part is tinted red.
1,The bag itself is nice however the colors are nothing like the picture so beware! I ordered the green and black and the picture shows a nice light green color but what I received was a ugly gray color and black. No way can this color be mistaken for green of any color!  So back it goes.
4,After a year of use for high school life and family travel the bag is holding up well but the outside does get dingy after a few months.
5,I love this. It’s very spacious has great quality and will be a perfect backpack for traveling/tourism. The cup holders in the side can hold small or large beverages.
5,Fits easily under airline seat.  Easy acess.  Spilled my coffee on it and although cloth outside was wet inside remained dry.  Saw another couple with a young child use same bag as a diaper bag
5,I bought this for traveling with my laptop. I have used it a lot and works so great!! Has great pockets that are so useful and I have even used it as a baby bag. And not to miss that the style and look of it is so good!!
5,This item is perfect and just as described. It has plenty of room for all of my stuff and is well built. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Like the big open pocket for school books and art supplies easy to access as well as padded pocket for laptop. Our college student is using it.Only con: had to open it and air it out a few days due to chemical smell. 🥺
5,Very nice 👍 Thank You!
5,This backpack is amazing! I had been looking for a backpack or tote bag for a very long time! When I found this I was ecstatic! I can fit everything I need for the day in it and keep it organized! That’s the best part! It has a handle on top if you’d prefer to carry it and it’s comfortable to wear!
5,Love this backpack! It has so many different compartments. I love the top opening.  The strap to put it in your carryon is great but it also comfortable to wear in your back.  The blue gray color is great too.
5,I am using this bag for nursing school and it has been great for organizing my books and nursing school supplies. I haven’t tested the water resistance part yet but it has been a great purchase so far. Very durable with the heavy books I have to carry for nursing school.
5,This is the best back pack I have ever owned. I love the opening and the interior is awesome.  You will not be disappointed.  For the price its a no brainer and I'm really happy that I own it. So much room.  Really well made.

4,Looks very nice appears to be quite sturdy 15"screen laptop fits perfectly.
3,I know I am going to love this bag for traveling. It has all the features I was looking for. This is the 4th bag I had delivered to me with the free return from Amazon on the others. The one thing that is bothering me as I am opening it for the first time is the off gassing. I will have to leave this open and out side for a week before I bring it back in and use the bag I will be putting baking soda inside and leave it our side. I will get back to continue my review when I start using the bag
5,Well made and holds my laptop charger cables snacks water bottle  umbrella phone tablet scarf and small purse with room to spare. Holds its shape nicely so it doesn't turn into a blob. Outside pockets and wide frame opening make it easy to find things. Normally I  hate backpacks but I love this one.
5,I really like the shape of this bag. It lets you fit a lot in but the shape and structure keep the bag looking nice.
5,Great backpack. Lots of space and unique and user friendly pockets. I bought for a trip and have loved using it since. 3 of my students have now bought the backpack too.
5,Heard about this from a client who told one my colleagues who told me and now I've told a dozen or so people. Word of mouth works and this backpack deserves high praise.
5,I ordered the blue grey color and its great!The size is amazing I wanted something that could fit my 12.9 inch ipad with space to spare.The shape makes it look professional enough for work.I really love the amount of pockets and the fact that there are two water bottle/drink pockets instead of one.
5,The one backpack that’s large enough to hold  my laptop workout clothes and lunch for daily NYC commute. It’s so much better than carrying large totes. Also prevents back pain.
5,Best backpack ever! It looks professional and what’s more I can easily find all of my things.  Highly recommend
5,Love this bag!  I use it for work and need to have a light weight bag due to back issues.  This is professional looking and has room for everything I need.
5,I took this with me for a week as my only travel bag and it really did fit everything I needed. When I got it I thought it was going to be too small but it was perfect.
5,Great backpack for traveling held enough to be a carry-on for a trip to Alaska along with kid snacks spare clothes breakable items we brought back on-plane entertainment books/coloring & purse items. Also worked extremely well & was comfortable to go on adventures in the Alaska mountains.
5,What a great little backpack. I've gotten so much use out of it since I purchased it last year. Comfortable on the shoulders. Perfect size for what I need.
5,Not really sure about water resistance. I am taking this backpack traveling and put all my dogs necessities in it. Plus holds my lap top snacks paperwork and much more. Love it so far. Have only used it once.
4,I love the backpack but idk how water resistance it is. Because when i got it wet my things still go wet inside. But overall for school and traveling it’s great!
5,Love love love it! I am a teacher & carry a backpack full of books papers & my laptop back & forth every day. It’s perfect! Has held up well. Love the special spot for my laptop to slide right into.

5,I like it! Use it to travel - perfect “personal item” on a plane.
4,Good quality have used it for hiking multiple times and it has held together very well can fit a lot in it. really like it would recommend
5,For the price it is a very good bag! It holds my laptop iPad notebooks chargers and whatever else I need. I've only had it a little over a week so I can't speak on it's durability but I can tell with the material it'll hold up for awhile! Cute color and so many pockets!! Love it!
3,I really loved this bag. Initially got it to use as a carry on while flying but recently had to use it for a few quick overnight trips and had all my toiletries and clothes in the bag. It has plenty of storage and pockets which is nice. But just noticed after a few uses that there’s discoloration on the interior pockets. Not sure why... just sad that the quality isn’t as good as anticipated
5,Love the stiff zipper top that stays open when putting books in.  Fits all my books even my large three ring binder.  Padded straps are comfortable.  Lots of pockets for accessories.
5,Bought this bag for work. I'm a visiting nurse and am always carrying a large side bag. My shoulder couldn't handle any more and have been looking for the right backpack for a while. This one was perfect. Good large size. Many pockets and is very confortable. I would buy it again if needed :)
5,Great amount of space. Durability is awesome. I do wish the shoulder straps and back portion of the backpack worked better for weight distribution though. I definitely feel it when it’s a little heavier than usual.
5,Love this bag!
5,Love this bag! It’s perfect
3,I bought this backpack originally for traveling. The material is great and it is durable. I found it hard to open and close the main compartment. It became a problem having to continuously set my bag down and open and close it a certain way in order for the zipper to properly function. It's great backpack just not exactly what I needed.
5,Love this bag! I like the way the top stays open while I load it with laptop cellphone lunch and wallet. Fabric is a nice quailty and side pockets are deep.
5,It is surprisingly large. It can accommodate a lot of stuff.The top unzips and then opens wide. This makes it very easy to reach inside to get stuff out.

5,Love this bag! The main compartment is easily accessible and hold a lot. I use it daily for work and can’t wait to use it for my next vacation.

5,I originally had an Under Armour backpack that was white (bad choice!) and when I went to buy a new one I LOVED the look of this one.  It's great quality and it won't get dirty like my old white one!  It's unique and loving the style!
5,I have had many travel bags but this one takes the cake!  Light easy to store many items including my 15" MacBook Pro!  Great layout and the charging access port was a total plus!
5,My two sisters got themselves one. I liked so much that I had to have one too!

2,I bought this backpack because I wanted to use it as a personal item for when I’m traveling. The picture says that the height of the backpack should be less than 17 in but when I measured it I got a little less than 18” which is much bigger than the standard backpack. I don’t understand why it’s so tall.Other than that it seems to be made pretty well. The straps are comfortable and there are lots of handy pockets but I’m returning it because of the misleading measurements.
5,Holds a ton of things.  Very durable. Taken on several plane trips and no problems.  Very NICE
5,I use this bag for school and I absolutely love it!
5,Material is made of high quality cool pockets. I like how the opening is square. It fits my 15.6" laptop perfectly with plenty of extra room for textbooks and notebooks.
5,This backpack is awesome and can hold a lot so you have to be careful not to make it too heavy to carry.

5,Holds a lot and great quality material. Highly recommend.
4,I really like this backpack. It is very sturdy and seems well constructed. I bought this backpack thinking I was getting a black and lovely mint green exterior. Many of the pictures of this backpack on the website show a lovely mint green color in combination with black. It is definitely NOT a lovely mint green as shown in the pictures. It is more of a grayish-greenish not very pretty color. Overall I like the backpack but now I which I had chosen a different color.
5,I love this backpack so much. Perfect is size. Material is very nice and durable.
5,So much storage and space. It’s super lightweight. I use for laptop and also as a diaper bag!

5,This has been the perfect bag for work and travel. It’s well made easy to access all the compartments and stylish. Love it!
5,Has exceeded my expectations  love the versatility!
1,I did not like this backpack only time its a good use if you have bunch of notebooks/laptop to put inside or like clothes if you use it to travel it looks super awkward because its always leaned/bent forward I keep my work laptop and 2 notebook and a water bottle on the side but even with those it still cannot hold its weight and every time I put it down on somewhere it just falls forward SUPER annoying.… I wish I could return it but its too late to return it so this will be by travel bag where I only carry clothes I am about to order a different bag. Waste of my 30$.
5,Perfect for a modern briefcase especially traveling.
3,This bag is most definitely NOT waterproof. I had a water bottle bust that was in the outside bottle pocket and it ruined a laptop and a textbook that was rented for college!
5,Great carry on bag for air travel. Great size with nice outer easy access storage compartments.
5,I use this bag to travel. I travel for work and use it for my carry on. Fits under the airplane seat perfectly.

I love the wide nicely padded straps and that my 32 oz water bottle fits great 👍.  It will fit a larger bottle  if needed. I'm also loving all the POCKETS...SO MANY to put small personal items into.  I'm very pleased. Another great feature is the hard wire in the top to support it while it's open.

5,Work
2,I really want to love this backpack but I can't.  The bag does not sit up straight so it flops over every time it is sat down whether it has anything in it or not. I would not buy again because of this.
5,Amazing products
1,I would give this zero stars if I could. This was a replacement to the one I bought two years ago.  I loved the first but the quality on the second is terrible. The fabric doesn’t match the photo and is a much lower quality. I am now using the old one with the strap knotted when I broke the plastic off. It’s still better than the new one.
3,I like the looks but not enough compartments.
5,Awesome
2,I bought this bag in February and the wires that prop the bag open are coming out of the stitching. Super disappointed with this purchase.
2,This backpack weighs a lot! Then you add your personal belongings and it weighs too much for me to carry!!
2,Poor Quality.  Will be calling Amazon to try and return.
2,I didn’t like this backpack. It’s quite heavy empty and is very stiff. I will be returning
5,This bag was exactly what I needed. I work for a company that requires me to carry a good amount of things papers lab top label maker screws bolts etc. I am very please with this purchase of with standing the weight that it does. I have had this now for several months and no issues.
1,Super bummed! Initially I liked this backpack but after about a week the top zipper broke beyond repair. I tried initiating a return but I was traveling and could not return it before the window ended.
5,I wanted to write a review after using this backpack for a year so it would be a fair assessment. I am a middle age women that has worked in the business world for over 25 years. I have owned many laptop bags and backpacks that I carry daily into the office plus I travel through airports fairly often. I was always looking for a “better” bag option. Well I finally found it! This is my favorite and is truly one of the best values you will find. Here are my favorite things- Modern look waterproof light colored liner and wide opening make it easy see and find things. The pockets are strategically placed and the sleeve for the laptop holds your computer securely. I love this bag so much that when my two daughters told me they were pregnant “and due only a day apart” I went on a mission to find them each a new diaper bag for Christmas this year.  I started researching all the options and was so excited to see there was a Hap Tim diaper backpack. The cost was higher than many others but I went with my gut feeling on how much I loved mine and ordered them. I received them and was pleasantly surprised at how functional and sturdy the diaper bag version was. I gave them to both my girls for Christmas and they loved them. Now they just need to wait until May 2020 to use them :) Ironically one of my daughters that carries a laptop bag for work told me today she ordered the Hap Tim laptop backpack for work because she liked the diaper bag I gave her for Christmas. I order a lot from Amazon and don’t typically write reviews but I wanted to take the time to share how much I like this bag. It’s a great value so if you’re on the fence and struggling to decide this is your bag!
4,This bag is awesome for the price and I've gotten tons of compliments on it. It's withstood a year and a half of grad school which means it's carrying heavy textbooks my laptop toiletries groceries the occasional change of clothes the emotional weight of my future etc. and it has held up well. The pockets are conveniently arranged and fabric inside is easy to wipe clean. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is that it claims to be waterproof but I would argue that it is MAYBE water resistant - the laptop pocket is far enough back that it stays dry but I've damaged a few books and notecards left in the front pockets. Also it might be important to note that the shoulder pads have thinned out significantly in the time that I've had this bag (which is maybe to be expected given how much I've used it). I'll honestly probably buy this same bag again in a few months when the straps become uncomfortable.
5,When I'm at school I usually carry my 13-inch laptop three notebooks two folders with lots of paper in them a pencil case a water bottle an umbrella and lots of stuff in the pockets. Everything fits with extra space. I also like that the backpack is angled so that it flattens to the amount of stuff you have in it and the side pockets don't stick out too much when you have a regular-sized water bottle and umbrella in them. In other words it doesn't look bulky when you don't have a lot of things in it.I am also a small person at 5' and this backpack does not feel too big even when I stuff it to the brim. I tried three out backpacks from Amazon this past year and this was by far the best one. The color is great (I got dark grey) it's durable (I've used it for 6 months) and it's comfortable. I also really like the minimalistic look. It's not too flashy but it's still stylish. I added a keychain and a couple of buttons to  mine to personalize it. Overall I would highly recommend this backpack.
4,Just got this bag with a lightning deal.  I've been using a similar style bag that I really like but was looking for one with more interior space a wider variety of exterior pockets and better water resistance.  This is the one!  It seems to be very well constructed with all double zippers that work smoothly.  The only complaint I have is that it feels sounds and smells kind of plasticy.  I suppose that's why it is so affordable. I hope with time/use it will soften up lose that crinkly sound and feel more natural.  More color options would be great.
5,I purchased this bag for a trip. I needed a big backpack to use as my carry on. I picked a nice one! this bag has tons of room and its very cute. Love the strap on the inside to keep your laptop or tablet from sliding out of the pocket. Love that the water bottle pockets expand I carry 2 large water bottles and these pockets are amazing. I received sooo many compliments on my bag. Couldn't be happier.
5,This backpack was given to me as a Christmas gift. I love it! It is definitely a professional spin on a backpack it looks smaller than my previous backpack but because of the great design it actually holds more stuff and keeps it all organized.  The top open concept is already an awesome concept and this backpack makes it even better. While traveling after Christmas it held 2 sweaters 2 pairs of pants 2 vests laptop cords and laptop and could have easily fit a few more things. It is perfect for a long weekend trip or a busy day going from the gym to the office. My only recommendation is to have the clasp that holds the top straps together wrap around once before fastening. As it is designed now the button clasp comes undone too easily when carrying the bag.
5,I bought this bag to carry my laptop and paperwork back and forth from CT to FL as I was caring for my ailing father. I took at least a dozen trips in 6 months and this bag did not disappoint.  It’s incredibly well made and durable.  It has room for everything essential and fits under an airline seat with ease. The top zipper makes it easy to access the bag’s contents when it’s under the seat in front of you which is so convenient.  It has two side pockets for water bottles which are durable and sturdy.  I still can’t believe the bag costs less than $40.  It’s a real bargain.
5,Absolutely love this backpack! I have had a lot of different backpacks and this is very good quality for the price! Have not had this style before and so far loving it. Very nice durable material and the zippers are good quality. Love the wide opening to be able to view all of my stuff in one location and have the other pockets on the front for organizing smaller items! The straps are nicely padded. I think I finally found the perfect backpack for work. So glad I came across this backpack! Once again very impressed with the quality and function of this backpack!
1,Cheap and shoddy. Absolutely nothing anti-theft about this product.
5,I was gifted this bag for Christmas and I am a big fan. I take a lot of things back and forth to work and have a young child this bag keeps it all organized and easily accessible while keeping shape and still looking like a stylish backpack.
5,This is one of the best items I have purchased on Amazon. This item is not only an attractive backpack but it is durable compact multi-functional and reasonably-priced. I may just get another because it's that valuable an item.
5,Bought it for work and it’s perfect for my laptop water bottle and various items. Comfortable and has a ton of additional capacity if needed. Quality product
5,So far this has held up well and works great for a office/work bag and laptop carrying case
5,Perfect for my work commute Its able to blend in with the crowd but still cuter than most
5,I use this bag for work. I really like all the compartments.
5,Perfect backpack for traveling! I also use this bag for work!
5,Awesome bag .. fit for ofc and small travel stuff
4,Great backpack!! I’d only add double zippers so I can open it from both sides. #lefthandedissues
4,Fits a lot of stuff
3,I got this bag for a new job and its been great until I picked it up by the shoulder strap and I heard it rip...
5,I researched multiple  laptop bags before purchasing this one.  I wanted a laptop bag that can fit multiple items  while on travel.  The thing that I love about this bag is the widemouth opening.  Things easily go in and out without too much digging around.  My laptop fit securely in the pocket with a Velcro strap.  It has plenty of pockets for me to put my charger and other items.  I like that the side pockets  are deep and will hold a drink without tipping over and falling out.  It fit nicely underneath the airplane seat on multiple trips.  Definitely a great purchase and a great price.
5,I was looking for a back pack that didn’t fall over and that had width space. I use this for work everyday. Iv’e used it for a month or two so far. I pack my lunch and water bottle work papers and a slim laptop. There are plenty of pockets on the outside for organizing and there is a lot of space on the inside. I bough this specifically because of how the back pack opens. Unlike a normal Jan sport backpack when you open it the flap doesn’t fold down and lose it’s stiffness. The only thing I would add is a hard bottom to make it stand up better.
5,I love this backpack! It’s very sturdy and holds so much stuff. There were even more pockets than I realized. My old backpack was full. I moved everything into this one and it’s not even half way full yet. Has a strap to attach to Your luggage for travel.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!  Stylish and functional. I am in love with this bag— bought for my graduate studies. It fits my tablet binders pencil bag and chargers perfect. I’ve only had it a couple of months but it is holding up well. Plan on using it for a flight next week. If you’re on the fence... buy it!
5,I had been looking everywhere for a durable bag with lots of room for work. (ICU RN) I am so impressed with the size of the bag vs ALL THE ROOM in it! The material is very attractive and sturdy. Ecstatic & impressed and coming from me that's alot.
5,I'm happy with the appearance and I've received quite a few compliments on its styling. I use it for work so sometimes it's carrying my laptop and heavy files. It's holding up well so far.
5,This bag is so stylish spacious & I love all the pockets! It was pouring rain the other day & the inside wasn’t wet! I’m so happy with this purchase! Thank you!
5,I love this bag! I’m in health care and travel a lot. Very happy to be able to carry all of my things in an organized fashion. <3
3,I like the backpack . The only problem was I thought I was buying a new product not a return.  It smelled of perfume and There was Kleenex and a lifesaver candy in one of the zippered pockets .
5,I haven’t changed my backpack since I bought this one! I love it! Helps you stay organized
5,It’s perfect backpack!! It has so many pockets for everything. I have few backpack but this is my favorite. I highly recommend.
5,Living in the city and not having a care I walk or use public transit to get groceries every couple weeks. So having a bag that can hold a lot is key. This bag is incredible! Holds so much! Inside fabric is easy to wipe down incase of accidental spills. Overall great for anyone who lives in the city and needs a durable bag to help on big hauls from the grocery store or famers markets.
5,I love how much space it has and it seems very durable. Can’t wait to use it when I go to Disney!
5,I am a traveling teacher and use this backpack to carry supplies and my laptop. I am in and out of schools all day and this backpack has been able to withstand everything I put it through. It has enough pockets for all my supplies and allows me easy access to everything. I’ve been using it for 2 years and it’s still as good as the day I got it!
5,i use this every single day for work and i love it
5,This book bag fits all the things I need its great to travel with love it
5,I love this bag! I wanted an easier to carry computer bag that was cute and backpack style fpr work. The added bonus is that this bag is water proof! There is plenty of room for my computer planner and graded papers. So much nicer than the computer bag I was given from my district.
5,I absolutly love this backpack. I have a hap Tim diaper bag I purchased almost 2 years ago and it's still in near perfect condition so I was confident this backpack would be quality. I use it daily for work packing a tablet coloring supplies feminine supplies chargers basic hygiene items chapstick deodorant etc my small purse and several other small items and it's never full! I love the wide open framed top and pockets are all huge! Flexible bottle pockets hold all my different cups and this is the best backpack I've ever owned.
5,I cannot say enough wonderful things about this backpack. I love the color it has been very durable it is truly water resistant (I have had a few spills) and it is very easy to clean. I originally bought this for traveling but I have ended up using it all the time! All of the different pockets and zippers make it easy to organize your things and find what you need easily. I would highly recommend!
5,It is stylish and easy to clean. As well as holds quite a large amount! We took this bag to Disney world and it worked great. Held lots of snack for the kids a change of clothes and extra drinks sunscreen etc.We were able to sanitize and wipe it off easily everyday. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,Good bag spacious I like the pockets the zippers are good
5,I am a Hospice Nurse which means I carry a ton of things with me. This bag fits all of the items I need and then some! This is an amazing bag!!!
5,Good bag. Exactly as advertised. Nice colors well built. Slightly smaller than expected but plenty big enough to pack for a weekend trip.
5,Durable easy to wipe down small enough for city travel. Fits a tremendous amount of items including a bulky lunch bag
5,Bought this backpack for school and to replace my medical bag and it is doing a great job. It’s the perfect size cute and had just enough pockets for everything that I need. Great deal for the price
5,The problem with my standard backpack is once i throw everything in I'm left digging through it to find something. This bag solved that issue for me.It has numerous front pockets and there's sleeves on the inside too. I have assigned each pocket to be designated for certain things like electronics toiletries random documents etc. I no longer have to dig in my bag for anything! It's extremely spacious it fits my giant 2-story bento box and there's plenty of room for more for whatever i want to take. It's naturally on the stiffer side and remains upright when you set it down which is nice also. I can see myself traveling with this in the future. It looks well made there's double stitching on areas that would most likely tear. Highly recommend.
5,Durability is great. I wear it every day and am constantly taking it on and off. I’m very hard on my things and  not delicate AT ALL! The straps have held up well and it’s water resistant. I have a few stains that I can’t get off but that may just be the type of material or that I am not crafty enough to remove stains haha
5,Typically I don’t take the time to do a review but this back pack is absolutely perfect!!! Exactly what I was looking for for a weekend get away.  Plenty of room for clothes toiletries and my laptop.  So happy with this bag!
5,this backpack fits everything i need it to! today I put:- laptop- iPad- planner- textbook (~3in thick spiral bound)- notebook binderand on top: lunchbox. It was a little tricky to close but it all fit and worked perfectly! The little diagonal opening pocket is very nice for keeping my dissecting forceps and field vials (I am in an entomology course) the main bag has LOTS of room and the side pockets will hold a large hydroflask.
5,Beautiful design. Exactly what I was looking for! Will be using it for work to carry 3 water bottles and lunch prep containers. The material is easy to clean and pretty!
5,I took this backpack with my to Italy. It was a super easy backpack to use and was lightweight. During the 9 hour flight I had comfortable access to my books chargers neck rest and snacks. Nothing spilled out of the bag while trying to access various items. The small top zipper pocket fit my translation book and it was great for quick easy access. I kept my plane train tickets there as well.During my travels I took this backpack with me to every outing. It held 2-32 oz water bottles sunglasses sunscreen two large beach towels for beach days (could not zip but the clasps made it secure) and other items.Once back from vacation I use it daily for work - it had my laptop charger notebooks and water bottle.Absolutely recommend this to anyone that travels and anyone that needs a backpack for work!
5,Very functional! For work lunch and gym!
5,Took this to Italy Germany Spain and it worked beautifully. Fit under all the plane seats and holds a ton!! With luggage problems lately packing outfits in my carry on was a breeze. Would definitely recommend!
5,Just received this backpack & it's exactly what I was looking for. Light weight water resistant has a nice feel to the fabric and SO much room. This also has a feature I have never seen on a backpack the top has a hinge on the main opening to the inside space so the bag stays upright and open to pack and find items inside. It's large and roomy even with a lap top and all the accessories. The outer bottle pockets are large enough for my 32 oz iron flask thermos with the neoprene cover and there is one on each side. The computer pocket is large and deep and there are zippered pockets all over so every inch of space is utilized. If it doesn't hold up on my trip I will update this review but for now I am very satisfied with my purchase. Plus the design is so shiek.
5,Easy to open and access all the items while in a very small seat with bag on the ground. Very spacious main compartment and various pockets were great for organizing. I even kept an umbrella and drink container in the side compartments which did not come dislodged as I used for the flights. It probably works well for a daypack as well but I had another small bag with anti-theft engineering.Will definitely use again.
5,I bought this bag for work to bring my laptop to and from the office and I have gotten so many compliments!! I also use this bag for weekend trips and it holds everything I need!
5,Perfect bag  as I work remote and in multiple office locations. I figured out a filing system that works great using a magazine file box that fits perfectly as an insert in this back pack. This backpack doubles as my purse also so it’s great looking and super functional. Highly recommended!!
5,Exactly what I was looking for!
5,Traveled with it loved the wider opening! and the pockets!!!  Was perfect !!!
5,I love this bag for school! I’m on campus all day 5 days a week so I pack for the day. This bag is large enough for 2 laptops + cords a 3 subject notebook and 2 class books. And that’s on top of the usual day to day stuff that I carry around anyway. The straps are better padded then I thought they’d be when I ordered the bag. The various pockets are useful and well thought out. I’m in the PNW and this bag is water resistant enough that I’m not super panicked about my electronics if it’s raining. I don’t think this bag will do well in a downpour but for steady/misty rain it repels water well. The biggest thing I think needs improvement are the zippers- which are a definite leak point for water. If the inside of the bag gets wet it’ll be because the zippers let water through. I still recommend this backpack for college students and I’d buy another if I needed 2!
5,Backpack was as expected. Lots of room inside and plenty of pockets for storage of items.
5,I purchased this for a trip. It was perfect. It held my 12.9” iPad Pro no problem. It has lots of useful pockets. I had room for a book sweatshirt chargers and some snacks with plenty of room to spare. It fit nicely under the seat in front of me during flights. I really enjoyed using it.It is lacking a lock so I wouldn’t use it for international travel but I will get a lot of use out of it for local traveling..
5,I would definitely recommend this for anyone
5,Very stasified! Great product
5,This backpack is great!Really good quality and can hold quite a bit.My wife uses this for work and it holds everything she needs in it. Just like its meant to do.
5,The pictures does the backpack no justice. It is really beautiful and nicely made. I hope it lasts. I only bought it because of the wide opening. Schools have these kids carry so much! It does the job and is a beautifully crafted backpack.
5,We love traveling and hiking and this backpack was beyond useful for that purpose but would be amazing as an everyday backpack as well. It has so many different compartments and hold a lot more than you think. We took this backpack everywhere and are completely amazed with how much we can fit in it great for weekend trips and airline companies that only allow a personal item
5,Love the design and the “wide mouth”Holds alot and is very attractive!
5,So happy I purchased!
5,I am just so happy with this bag. I initially worried that it will be too large or bulky looking as I'm only 5ft petite but it's perfect. Feels perfect. It's like a normal sized backpack with a ton of storage! I will be using it as my nurse work bag travel bag. It's a win with this one ! Love it. The design is simple sleek. A high quality bag at an amazing price.
5,So roomy with many useful pockets. It even fits my large 32 oz. water bottle! Would definitely recommend!
5,I use this as a work bag unfortunately it looks just like my grandsons diaper bag. Wish I would've got a different color
5,This backpack met my needs for a travel backpack. My 15” laptop fits! My planner fits! So much organization! My Simple Modern water bottle fits in side pocket! So much room remained that I was able to fit my lightweight fall jacket inside...and still had room to spare! Best part... the durable strap on back to attach to luggage handle! I highly recommend!
5,Awesome tech bag.  Now I can organize all my tech accessories in different compartments and still have room to fill in the main compartment with a sweater or any non-tech item.  Love the two wide bottle holders on the side; since I have a 40oz bottle that fits easily in.  The best feature of all and surprised of was the top file like wire opening of the bag.  Really good quality so far and the bag holds its shape because of the top wire feature.
5,I absolutely love this backpack! I use it for traveling for my laptop. I have a 15 inch laptop and it works perfectly. I have no issues with it. Plenty of pockets and room.
5,I loved this backpack. This has so much space it fits my 15.6 laptop and all my notebooks and still has space for so much more. It doesnt look to big which is great since I'm only 5'1 and most backpack are to big. Overall loved this backpack.
5,I love this item. I will use it in one month when I go to Europe . It’s beautifully designed and well constructed.
5,I bought this to travel for three weeks and after heavy use on the trip it still looks like new. The design is very functional all the pockets were perfect for what I needed. It’s excellent quality and looks great also. I have gotten many compliments on it.
5,I am in llooovvee with this bagpack. It has everything you need and more than what you Think you need. I have a surface go and laptop I bring to school constantly. They now have their own perfect compartments inside. No need for them to clank against eachother.The amount of other compartments are perfect. They're snug and with purpose that I have a place for everything. No need to open 5 deep sized pockets wondering where the hell you put your wallet/keys/lipbalm.You also have two holders for a Waterbottle and another bottle of your choice! Helllooo protein shake+water combo.The straps are very comfortable too.Trust me it's the little details you would've never thought important. Like how the bag zips open widely when hung against that toilet door or a hidden zipper of a small compartment perfect for your wallet and keys.You will not be disappointed. If you are... Go use a plastic bag for school.
5,I love love love this backpack. I really wish I had come across this one sooner before I bought a few other older backpacks for university but now that I have it it's a life-saver. It's roomy very comfortable to have on even when it's crammed full of books holds my 14" laptop books lunch and pencil case has big side-pockets to hold my umbrella and tumbler and plenty of extra pockets in the front for wallet bus pass lip balm and more. Plus it is water resistant - I've tried it out in my rainy hometown and it's held up nicely in a bit of rain (not entirely sure about full-on downpours). All in all a really solid backpack and one that seems built to last me a long while too.
3,I've been using this bag for a while now and it's nice having so much room to carry things to and from work but the bag is unbalanced when it's just got my laptop in it or if it is empty. It doesn't sit flat and instead leans forward to the point of tipping over. When you've got something heavy in the main area of the bag then it's fine but a laptop in the laptop compartment wont be enough. The zipper is also a bit of a pain to open as you need to hold one side with one hand while you pull the zipper with the other. The number of compartments is also lacking so I really just use the main area to keep everything.Despite that it's a solid bag that I use every day and it was pretty cheap. There is plenty of room and the main compartment opens really wide to even fit in quite wide and tall items.
5,I have just received this bag it hasn't been stress tested but I am planning for this bag to be my everyday bag. I will adjust my review accordingly after seeing how it holds up at school. I currently carry roughly ~18lbs of materials with me and as you can see there is still more room. The bag is spacious enough to carry two 14 inch laptops and roughly 700 sheets of paper there's plenty of room to carry several electronics and their power cords as well.Pros:Spacious and high carrying capacityNice materialQuick and easy access to everyday itemsCons:None as of yet will edit for in the future.
5,I truly love this back pack! I love the way it opens like a doctor's bag on top. There are so many pockets for me to fill. I'm going to Mexico at the end of this week and it fits everything perfectly as my carry-on. I got the dark grey and it is sooo pretty and the material is excellent. It's pretty and well made.  This bag has a strong structure that I know will hold up and last me many many years. I am very picky and I am honest in my reviews and I myself follow other's reviews here on amazon.ca. I got this on sale for $10 less than actual price. It's the quality of a $60 bag. I would buy this again!
5,I'm a university student and I have to carry thick books papers laptop etc. The square frame of this bag makes everything so easy when looking for something in the bag. Papers can be compartmentalized so they stay clean and don't fall on everything else in the bag. Laptop/tablet fits the size you need because it's velcro adjustable size and we'll protected. We still have room for at least two to three binders in the middle. Bottlewise I have a big water bottle that didn't fit/stay still in my other schoolbag but this one is made for all bottle sizes and high as well so it stays still. The extra compartments are awesome because it can fit a lot of stuff which unclutter the main compartment of the bag. Water resistant. Zippers and fabric are good quality. It isn't bigger than necessary because of the way it's built.Only thing I can see it could be improved it's the quality of the shoulder straps. They are ok but could be made a little bit more solid and comfortable. Yet I haven't used it for a long period of time so it still can surprise me.Sum up: no regret at all!!! Looking forward to use it more often!
5,I've had my backpack for 6 months and I still really love it.  The quality of the materials and the workmanship are excellent and it has held up perfectly under daily use.  The top-loading "doctor's bag" design is really convenient.  The abundant pockets are roomy and well placed and all the zippers are smooth to operate and durable.  The volume is quite good - you could fit a pair of running shoes work-out clothes towel & toiletries for the gym but that would pretty much fill it up.  There are cheaper backpacks out there but for what you get I think this is a good value.
5,LOVE this backpack.  I was looking for a slightly feminine take on a laptop backpack and this fits the bill nicely.  I carry it for business much more current than my old Targus business bag.  Not too heavy and well made.  The only downside is the lack of inner pockets in the biggest section; there is one for the laptop and another thin one for tablets but that is it.  And no pockets for credit cards etc in the front pockets.  However it does have fantastic side water bottle pockets that fit large or small water bottles (not cheap mesh) and a headphone or phone cord hole.
5,This is exactly what I have been looking for: a stylish yet roomy backpack that is quality-made with lots of convenient compartments and pockets! I have not been in a downpour but it has resisted rain and was not soaked through at all or even looked like it got wet. I love all the different zippered pockets for organization and easy access to things you need quickly. I wasn't sure at first about the doctor-bag opening but it allows for so much room and easier packing. I use this for work and is large enough to fit my lunch bag. I can see this would also be good as a carry-on bag when travelling. The straps are well padded as is the back and one of the most comfortable backpacks I have ever owned. I am 5'3" and even with the bag laden with groceries I find it very comfortable unlike other backpacks I have had. I am so happy with this purchase! I love it and have only had it a couple of months but hope it is durable. The materials seem sturdy and the zippers are not cheap so I expect it will.
4,Updating from belowThe bag is good but noticed the bottom needs to be better enforced. There is durability issue. Long term books and it's corners will tear the corners._____________________Thanks for all the other product reviews. It helped me to buy this bag. The capacity is amazing! I needed one bag for work and for gym. I got tired of lugging my sneakers and clothing in my gym bag while lugging my work laptop.By comparison to my other Tzowla knapsack also bought on Amazon while great and excellent quality with TSA lock wasn't configured to take on capacity.The new bag feels durable - as durable as the Tzowla. I will write back if this starts to fall apart. Great travel - short business day trip bag. Very happy.
5,Great product  fast delivery and a lot of space. I bought it yesterday for my school.I received it today and im so happy how big it is. I put inside my running shoes books  clothes for gym & laptop hp. It close well and still have place left. I will definitly use it to travel. And its comfy. I just need to see if its waterproof and durable.
5,I researched for days and looked at a tonne of backpacks for work travel and this was the winner. I have not been let down. It's great sturdy and has the right number of zippered pockets so my stuff is organized and doesn't fly around in the overhead bin on a flight. The straps are comfortable the backpack is really nice looking and sleek and it fits so much stuff! I switched to a backpack to ease shoulder pain and should have done it way sooner.
5,Love this bag! I bought it for Xmas for my 6 yr old son. He’s not into “kid stuff” but wants “cool stuff”. 🤦‍♀️ So finding him the right backpack was a struggle. I’m not going to say how long I spent searching for the right bag. 😬I was really impressed with the quality of this bag. The fabric is sturdy and the pockets and zippers don’t seem cheap at all. I love that when you open it it actually stays open and it makes it so easy to find everything.I bought my son this bag to use in the car & travelling. (It’s too nice to spend to school where he’ll wreck it for sure.) I specifically wanted something that opened wide at the top and had lots of organizing pockets for all his random stuff. We did a big road trip over Xmas break and this bag was awesome. Not once did he whine he couldn’t find something or that he lost something.We travel back and forth to our cottage weekly in the summer and I’m excited for him to have a bag to keep all his random stuff organized.
3,I have been using this bag for a month now ... I love it. It is amazing BUT yesterday we had heavy rains in eastern Canada. Unfortunately all my paper works books notebooks were deep WET and ruined. I couldnt believe it. I had to go back on Amazon to make sure it said WATERPROOF for real. that is the only negative thing I have. We have crazy winter here I am afraid during crazy winter storms I will have to buy other notebooks and have my notes ink ruined. FIX IT please
5,Twice a week I have to work in the office which means that twice a week I have to tote a (heavy-design) laptop along  with a ton of papers and other items. My old backpack was good for this but it was bulky and decidedly not lightweight. So after reading some reviews I opted for this one. And I'm really pleased. This bag probably weighs about half the weight of my last one; it doesn't have 'flaps' protruding from the straps (as my last one did); it's roomy it fit my bulky work laptop and all other items; and...it's pretty nice to look at. My only regret: I wish I'd bought it long ago. Well worth the money!
4,can fit a ton of stuff.  bought it as a replacement to my kids nappy bag.  I'd bought the hap tim nappy bag backpack style 3 years ago and it was great.  we took it every where travelled extensively with it generally abused it.  the zipper finally broke after over filling it one too many times so bought this one as a replacement since we didn't need things like bottle holders anymorethe quality of this bag is rather lower than the first hap tim.  it's fine. but because of our original experience I was expecting more.  there's a few cut corners in manufacturing such as inside mesh pockets have a top finished seam of zero stretch nylon so 1) you can't get much in them 2) things just slide out.  in our first bag the comparable inside pockets had an elasticated top so it was a much more useable pocket. I bought 3 small packing cubes that fit nice inside to help keep things organized. this works well.the interior pocket is huge can fit a ton of stuff and I love how it opens to a wide mouth so you can see all contents.also super super lightweight - nothing worse than when your bag is 5-6 lbs before you even put stuff in it.hoping it holds up despite some noticable changes in quality from our first bag.overall I'm happy with it and for the right use case would recommend it - especially for the price.
5,This is a really great backpack. It has lots of extra pockets for smaller items and for devices like laptops and tablets. The zippers all work well. I love that the top opening has wire edging so that it stays open while you're putting stuff in and taking stuff out of it. And the double handle at the top is really handy for when I need a break from carrying it on my back. I highly recommend this bag. Especially for the price. It's fantastic.
5,I absolutely love this bag. Bought it to carry my heavy Thinkpad. Laptop compartment is adjustable so I was able to expand (added another laptop) or shrink it to keep it snug. The main compartment opens up nice and wide making packing and seeing everything inside much easier. It is a deep bag. So many other useful sized compartments/pockets. Was  able to fit 2 iPads in another pocket that was a perfect fit.This bag is great for use as a carry-on or people with young children. We always need to carry around lots of things for them too. I wish I found it when I needed to carry diaper bags around.Quality seems good too. Would definitely recommend it to friends.
5,I absolutely love this bag! It compliments well with my E-Tree Messenger Bag that I purchased a month or two ago for work. The Hap Tim bag fits my Lenovo Thinkpad T495S (14") my iPad 2019 model five 1" binders one textbook (but I could probably squeeze another or two) and still have a little wiggle room. As a university student I don't carry all of my textbooks or binders just the ones that I need. Most of my notes are taken on Google Docs anyway so I don't find myself carrying binders just the textbook. I do carry one binder (a purple one) which houses looseleaf paper but since I have the iPad now I don't think I will be using that binder much often.The Hap Tim bag has a lot of compartments as seen in the photographs attached. In the second to the front pocket I can fit my Pro Case pencil case my iPad lightening cord my laptop charger and my RAVPower PD Portable Charger to charge my laptop and cellphone. If I'm at school for a portion if the day I only bring my portable charger to charge my laptop if need be. I only bring my laptop charger if I know I'm going to be on campus from morning to midnight. I do however bring my portable charger's charging brick with me just in case I need to charge the portable charger in between classes so technically I don't need to bring my charger but I do again only on days when Im on campus all day which are Tuesdays.This bag is wonderful for university students as it isn't "basic" like Jansport or Herschel bags. Its much more affordable I got mine at 45.99$ with a 3$ off and an 8$ coupon. So in total I purchased this bag for 34.99 free shipping. It is water resistant which is amazing considering my old Big Student Jansport bag wasn't and when it rained my textbooks and binders were soaked and my old laptop had water damage. Note to future students: check the weather before leaving your apartment!So far this bag is holding up but if anything changes I'll be back. On a final note when I revived this bag it smelt sooooo good. It didn't smell like a "new backpack" but it smelt like fabric softener or those Downy Unstoppables. I don't know if this bag was used but it smells really good.The dark grey colour seems more like a charcoal colour to me which is good because it matches my E Tree bag.
3,Its a pretty sturdy bag. I have been using it everyday for work. There have been a few times where the rectangular metal rods that give it shape at the top with the zipper have become displaced and I've had to shape them back into place. Its very roomy otherwise. Wouldn't expect it to last through a thunderstorm but with an umbrella I'm fairly confident it will keep my books and laptop safe and dry. I don't think I would buy it again.
5,Was waiting to use this bag on a travel trip to Iceland and Berlin before writing a review. And this bag is awesome. I use it for work primarily. Fits my laptop lunch gym clothes/shoes and more.For travel it’s great too as you can fit a lot. And it helps having the strap in the back to put over the handle on the luggage. Just be cautions tha the bag tends to fall forward so when you place it on the carry on luggage it may tip over. But other then that! Love it!
5,I was looking for a stylish functional additional bag to my carryon for travelling which has lots of pockets and something for my iPad Pro to fit in when travelling and this was the perfect bag for it. Holds so much and has side pockets for water bottle/umbrella. I especially like how it opens.  I own many backpacks of all sizes but this one will be my go to for air travel. Highly recommend.
5,The backpack is good quality material and well built.  It's able to hold a couple 2" binders and a few textbooks in the largest compartment.  The doctor-bag style is different from the average backpack but a nice touch.  It makes it easier to zip everything up and add/change out binders notebooks and textbooks.  It may not have as much room as some backpacks but it's very close and what it lacks in space it makes up for in quality.  There are three smaller compartments on the backpack great for placing phones personal items and school supplies in.  The laptop pouch seems to be well protected and fits a 15.6" laptop - it would not be able to fit anything larger as the length of the laptop reaches just below where the backpack closes and zips up.  It's been tested against a twenty minute walk in steady rain - the outside of the bag was wet but it dried quickly and the inside and its contents were safe.  The only adjustment that would make it all the more better would be additional padding on the back area and straps.  Other than that this backpack makes for a worthy purchase.
3,The top design of this backpack was quite intriguing to me however it doesn't function well when you are trying to balance the bag on your knee and zip it up with only one hand eg. At the grocery store.  It looks stylish; however the lining feels a bit cheap. I haven't had a chance to test how waterproof it is yet.
5,Got this for college and I am not disappointed!!!!!!!Made with good quality.Fits 6 text books computer water bottle (1 on each side) and so many little compartments.Super durable and water resistance for those snowy/rainy days.Super comfortable to wear.Love the light wash black color.10/10 in my books and would definitely order again !!!
5,I wanted something that wasn't super bulky yet held a lot. I tried some pretty nice messenger bags (sorry for the returns Amazon!) but they hurt my shoulders too much once loaded.I have a hiking backpack that works good for me but its not super convenient to take places with my laptop/books etc. and it stands out terribly.  This holds a lot and is reasonably comfy to wear. It smells a little funky but I'm sure that will disappear in time. Since its -40 here I have no idea how it holds up to water... I'll get back to you on that!its super handy to have the top opening like a doctors bag. You can set it next to your chair and it get your things in and out easily without having to lay it down.Really it's worth the money.
5,I looked all over amazon for the best laptop bag to carry my laptop + xbox phones tablet and cords.This firs my 16" MBP xbox one+controllers and all the cords i need with extra space left over.A+ if you see this order this before any other laptop backpack on here super high quality has not ripped carrying 50lbs in it.
5,I absolutely love this backpack. It has a sturdy thin metal framing at the top of the bag that allows you to open and close the bag with ease as if it was a luggage. The zippers are durable as well as the bag material itself. I could easily see this lasting me a decade at the way least!! There's so many small compartments that I can't praise enough. Right now Inside my bag I have 4 notebooks 4 novels a portable led reading light an automotive inverter secondary external battery pack for my phone a couple of charging cables for my phone my medication my moisturizing cream my pain cream and several pens.If you want a space saving bag with many compartments for all your items then this is it.
5,Love this bag. Perfect size and great design it holds so much stuff - great for travel. Recently used it while at a big conference and easily carried my laptop files notebook water bottle snacks and all the extra things. Day to day it’s great for me because I’m a remote employee and change locations regularly so this bag is my office/desk in a bag. The price is reasonable too. Love the waterproof quality: I live in the northwest we get lots of rain! The doctor style opening I wasn’t sure about at first but it’s grown on me and it helps me see everything in the bag way better than tradition pack designs. Very good buy.
4,I was looking for a backpack that would look serious and stylish but would also carry quite a bit. In these regards I am quite happy. I enjoy all of the compartments and I appreciate the separated laptop section. The reason I am taking off one star is a big one for me - the water bottle compartments. When looking at pictures and reviews one of my biggest worries was how this backpack would hold my water bottle. My water bottle is a regular size - no hydroflask or huge thing and it just falls inside the compartment with lots of room around it. The fact that the holders have an elastic component is almost laughable considering that they wouldn't need to constrict anything unless the bottle were quite large which I don't think it usual. Even my umbrella would fall out if the backpack were not held upright. This is not too big of a deal because the holder is so tall that it easily contains my water bottle but I do with it were tighter and would serve more of a purpose. This is a bit tangential but I wish I'd read a review about this because for me it is a bit of an important feature.Regardless nice backpack ok price and 4 stars.
5,I absolutely love this bag. It’s stylish and perfectly sized. It not only fits my laptop but also my lunch to go plus water bottle keep cup and some books n things. It has different little pocket areas to keep  bits n pieces nearby at the front and doesn’t weigh as much as my old clunky bag which could only fit my laptop. I am so glad I purchased as it’s a great all round bag. I couldn’t be happier!
5,Seems to be a really good quality bag.  I like the fact that it has "bottle holders" on both sides and a strap to attach to roller-bag luggage.  I can't speak to the quality of the water-proofing as I haven't tested it out but the material seems really good.  I also really like the "doctor bag" style opening at the top.  The photo depicts a couch cushion inside the bag to see how it fills out.  Very satisfied with this purchase so far!
5,I cannot say enough about this back pack! Everyone compliments it. It's well made and really comfortable. I love that there are enough pockets for organization but not so many that you cant find what you're looking for. Holds a lot - great for a college student.
4,I bought this bag to take as a personal item on short trips rather than a carryon suit case. After a few uses I can say I’m very happy with it. The straps do dig a bit when it’s full but I wasn’t doing much long distance walking while wearing the bag so it hasn’t been an issue yet. I could fit a good amount in all the pockets but the main area isn’t as big as I expected. Overall it’s a great deal and I for sure buy it again.
5,Purchased this laptop backpack to carry my books spare equipment and lap top for Bagpipes.  I love the way it opens wide and allows easy access to the contents of the backpack.  Very comfortable to wear on your back for long distances.  I just love this backpack!
4,Not sure if it's water resistant. I like the colour great for traveling however its just a hassle for opening and closing at the airport when taking my lap top in out for security check. I need to use both my hands to zip while holding the laptop. Because of that I will not use again for traveling it's totally great for other reasons though.
2,One zipper broke with first use which is why i give it 2 stars. I bought this as my personal carryon on the plane to store laptop etc. one of the zippers broke before i even left the house but since it is double zippers i was still able to use the zipper on one direction only. It’s a very practical bag padded for storing electronics and lots of extra pockets to stay organized.
4,Just received this bag and so far everything seems promising. In-person the bag looks small (to which I thought was bigger due to how the bag was described as being large capacity and other reviews being able to fit in a lot of items in it). The ease of use of opening the bag having everything displayed to you is a PLUS unlike other bags having to scramble just to open it. My MSI GS65 (15.6" slim laptop) easily fit no problems at all and a small water drop test proved the bag to be water-resistant (to a certain degree of course).Pros/Cons/Nitpicks:+Large Open/organized design (Bag's rectangular skeleton allows for quick access for many or large items)+Small footprint for its capacity+Water-resistant+Side pockets for large water bottles/umbrella+Appropriate amount of accessory pockets (1 quick access 1 small/medium/large)-No cons thus farSide pockets should be able to be tightened for smaller objects so they don't fall outAn added small hidden pocket behind back would be usefulAn added waist belt may be useful(More) Padding around handle/straps/laptop pocket would make this bag VERY competitive as well as the other nitpicks if they were added.8/26/19 Bag bought for $39.09CAD
4,Haven't actually used yet but seem to be made of good quality and has lots of storage.  Bought to use on my trip to Newfoundland look like I will have lots of space to put in my rain poncho wallet camera extra battery food warm sweater  and lots of other stuff.
2,I bought this because it was the correct size for discount airline personal item on Euro flights.  It's not a good option for travel.  it's just horribly uncomfortable. Poor straps. bad weight distribution and doesn't breathe.  Suffered for 2 weeks with the damn thing.
5,Love this! Little pocket up top quick access for bus card in pouring rain lower outer pocket flap with magnetic close for the phone inner massive waterproof lined space nice and bright so can see stuff. Stays open and stands up on its own when loading. Survived steady drizzle but haven’t tried torrential downpour yet... I bought this as acommuting backpack- didn’t realize it was a diaper bag ha ha so not sure what to do with the small changing pad ha ha. Very intelligent bag with tons of pockets and nice light grey exterior.
5,I didn't receive my order and got refunded promptly and customer service offered me more help amazing I will be writing a review on bag once received. I have red other reviews all good. I also have order other backs that do not compare in the space this bag has. Just received my bag amazing bag from other bags the pockets outside is lots of space and inside is amazing. Very nice and comfortable bag. Received it fast nice size bag. the description is right on. Thank you
5,I absolutely love this bag ! Plenty of space for computer  cables  lunch and very large water bottles in the side pockets ! I carry EVERYTHING I need for a day at work of a day away ! I liked it so much i recommended it to my sister and she bought one too & she loves hers too ! This bag will NOT disappoint ! Great product
4,We bought this for our teenage daughter to take to school and she really likes it.  it holds lots of stuff (which I'm told is important); it's durable convenient and she likes the look of it.  Nice!
5,Have not experience rain or snow on the walk home yet but overall I love this backpack. I use it instead of a purse now I take public transit and have to pick up my daughter so it's easier to have a backpack filled with treats and games. I love it.
5,I LOVE this backpack. The quality is amazing and you can literally fit EVERYTHING in it. I love how many compartments there are and it’s also so pretty. If you are looking for a bag for college or work something that will hold all your belongings comfortably and with support I highly recommend.
5,Le sac est parfait : beau plein de compartiments parfait pour le voyage ou le travail. Il n'est pas imperméable mais bien résistant à l'eau étant donné que les zippers et les coutures ne sont pas scellés. Néanmoins je l'adore il reste juste à voir s'il sera résistant au temps et a l'usure normale mais ma belle sœur a le même depuis un moment et ça semble être très bien
5,It fits my laptop perfectly and securely. Has many pockets for organizing things on the go. I used it when traveling for work as my carryon luggage. Very convenient at the airport comfortable straps and luggage strap worked well. I would definitely recommend this one to others.
5,I used this for a trip to Cuba and it was great! Lots of room and various pockets kept my ipad secure in the laptop area and fit under the seat in front of me nicely. It was great to have a backpack instead of a bag or small suitcase as it was on my shoulders and I had my hands free to hold anything I needed at the time. I would highly recommend it!
5,Is there an option for 10 stars? This bag is amazing!  Great quality and size.  Love the opening from the top it's great for commuting from office to home office and bringing my files home too. Lots of pockets and it's very stylish. I'm in love with this bag!!!!
5,Fantastic product I love all the pockets the light colour inside helps with seeing small items that may have fallen to the bottom.  It was however suprisingly a bit heavier that I was expecting.
5,I wanted to carry my heavy laptop lunch bottle combined with my everyday bag items (purse cosmetics keys glasses sunglasses and all the silly things I carry along when out of the house. :)Last week was a success! instead of having a laptop folder + lunch bag + everyday bag I could carry everything in one comfortable backpack.I would have choose a lighter / more fun coulours if available.Let's see the quality of the materials in time.Cheers.
5,Ce sac est mon sac de tout les jours pour le travail il tient parfaitement debout sur le siège passagé de la voiture et s’ouvre comme une valise de médecin. L’intérieur claire fait qu’on voit clairement ce qu’il y a à l’intérieur.
5,Nice backpack.  LOTS of room and pockets to keep track of items.  We are using it as our airline carry on bag. Looks just like the picture in ad.  I'd definitely buy another if needed.
4,Great bag for travelling the doctor bag opening is great would have given it 5 starts if there was another compartment (zippered) inside that would be useful for putting smaller items.
5,This backpack is perfect for a student.  There is a lot of space and different compartments for other stuff like power banks.  I didn't test the water resistance but I live in Vancouver (where it rains a lot!).  And the laptop hasn't got wet so far.  This is not the most comfortable backpack but it is decent!!
5,very convenient for office and travel - like the way it opens from top like a bag rather than traditional backpack - very well consstructed
3,Perfect for office / lunch box or travel use if you prefer bag pack vs mailman style. Lots of pockets and been using it everyday! Price point is a lil high.
4,Great laptop bag! Lots of space and easy access. Quite durable and stylish. I have received many compliments on the bag.
5,Love this pack! Holds everything I need for my daily trek to work and comfortable too! Only wish it came in more colors!
5,Perfect size for a carry on back pack ! Love how the top opens up wide so you have easy access to everything ! Wish it came in black but the dark grey is good too :) durable straps  doesn’t feel too heavy when bag is fully packed . Love the many compartments
1,Thought it was great when I first got it. However it did even last getting through the airport. The stitching pulled apart after just 2 hrs.
5,Really nice bag. Lots of pockets and organized storage. Opens and closely well. Like that I can easily go through it to get to my files unlike traditional bags that flop down when opened. Not sure about water resistant as I have t tried splashing it
5,This backpack is great and definitely multifunctional. I use it as my work backpack for day trips packing up my dog and could even be used as a diaper bag if needed.Snaps and zippers seem pretty sturdy and the picnic top is so practical!
5,This bag is really well made and has a lot of space to hold my laptop binders and textbooks. It has multiple pockets that are easy to access. I’m very happy with my purchase.
5,Bought this for work related travel and it is perfect!! Keeps the laptop protected yet easy to grab when going through security and has plenty of space for a sweater or scarf books water bottles tablet and more!
5,The bag is much larger than it looks! The computer fits perfectly and it does not even appear when you open the bag. There is a spot for the tablet and another one for the mobile phone. you can even add some clothes books food. I'll test if it is resistant during the trip and will change my comment accordingly. For now I recommand this bag.
5,Exactly as the description. Lots of pockets for storage great material durable compact but large enough to fit lots of clothes for overnight bag or for traveling as carry on. Luggage strap super convenient
5,Had this for several months now and it still looks brand new. I love it. The wide open top is awesome and it doesn’t look like a school bag. It’s professional enough to wear to work!
5,Backpack is very big and spacious but still fits perfectly on planes as a personal item. There is a strap on the back that will help attach it to your luggage and the many pockets have proven to be very beneficial. Overall one of the best backpacks I have ordered.
5,Perfect!As described I’m very pleased and I’m walking a lot with heavy camera gear and back pain! No problem since I’ve been using this backpack.
5,The wide opening top makes it so easy to find anything in my bag and it has a ton of pockets.  The material is durable and it looks great.  This will easily become my go to bag for day to day.
5,Great size durability so many compartments and feels like a solid bag! Useful for carrying my lunch to work everyday and big side pockets for my coffee and water bottle.
5,Bought it for work. It can carry all my paper works and my 15 inch laptop. The laptop compartment can be adjusted to the exact size you need. It had lots of easy access pockets.
5,I love this backpack! It has the perfect balance of storage pockets and open space to carry whatever I need with me and the bottle pockets are wide enough to my glass water bottle!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Excellent quality! I am so happy with this acquisition. Best bag I've ever had. I definitely recommend it to anyone. It will be useful for any situation (school work travel baby staffs)
5,This bag is FANTASTIC! I bought it for school and it holds all of my textbooks and binders. Large lots of pockets and compartments. I get a lot of compliments on the "doctor top" of it. Would buy it again hands down great product.
5,Love the style. When you open the backpack you see everything you have in it. Very good for having an organized backpack.
5,Love this backpack for daily work life. And when travelling. There is so many compartments and room.

5,Love this bag! Perfect size for almost anything- work travel school picnics baby stuff. Comfortable to wear and so many compartments. Highly recommend.
5,Just love this bag!  Top opens wide like a doctors bag.  Lots of space two padded areas for laptops.  I bought the dark grey one with a classy stripped interior.  Highly recommend.

5,i bought this backpack cause it was super chip and big when i received it i ordered 3 more for my friendsperfect for travelling and safety for your devices highly recommend it
5,A friend at work bought one loved it and sold the rest of us on it. I have bought 3 1 for me and 2 for gifts!
5,Love how it open to see everything in your bag and nothing falls out ..... other knapsacks need to be unzipped.Fabric is much nicer than anticipated.  I did not want it to look like a diaper bag.Cannot wait for my vacation.  Perfect personal carry on.
4,snug fit for a 15inch laptop. very functional pockets overall good quality and value for money if on a discount. One think i dislike is slightly stiffness of the bag but im pretty sure its bcos its not seasoned yet.
5,Bought this as a work bag as travel for work. Has great support on the stars and love the multiple pockets. Everything has a home!
5,Parfait! Beaucoup d'espace et de compartiments. Laptop sac à lunch et tout ce qui va habituellement dans un sac à main. Sac parfait pour le travail ou l'école.
5,This is the perfect backpack for our big trip to Europe!  It is exactly as described.  Very good quality too!
5,Fantastic especially with the top grab handles! Lots of space and great quality! Love it!
4,I used it for the first time today and have to say that I am quite impressed with it.  It holds a lot and I cant wait to start using it as a carry on.  Just wish it didn't have a frame to it.
5,Sac à dos parfait pour l'utilité que je voulais en faire (travail). Plusieurs compartiment et on peut facilement y glisser un lunch sans que tout les contenants vire à l'envers !!!Encore mieux qu'espéré
3,this is my work bag and i love it but its a touch too big for my personal needs its more of an over night or weekender bag i love the hinged main compartment opening
5,Exactly what I was looking for - great quality (similar to the Herschel which is at least double in price).  Love love love it!
5,I love this! So handy and I love the striped pattern inside! I use it for my laptop and it fits perfectly
5,Beaucoup d'espace pour ranger ma boîte à lunch et plusieurs poches pratique. Il est vraiment imperméable testé sous la pluie. Impressionnant j'adore!
5,The bag is well made. The zippers run smoothly and there's plenty of room for my computer books and a 2 inch binder. It fit my 17 inch laptop easily.
4,Great bag!  Durable.  Holds a lot.Downside is that it’s quit heavy when empty so had to limit what I put it in to lighter things.
5,Ma conjointe est enseignante et elle adore ce sac à dos très utile et pratique. Le tissu est vraiment de qualité et il y a plusieurs compartiments et poches.
4,Very good quality. Carries lots of things. Good pocket design.

5,Tatsächlich ist dieser Rucksack für mich perfekt! Ich suchte einen Arbeitsrucksack in dem ich mein 14 Zoll Laptop und mein Tablett sicher verstauen kann der mir Platz für  weiteres lässt ohne zu riesig zu sein - was hier genau zutrifft. Was ich am tollsten finde ist die Art der Öffnung die Reißverschluss oben ist mit Metallstangen unterlegt und deshalb lässt er sich oben richtig weit öffnen so dass man immer den Überblick behält. Die Tragegriffe sind auch optimal in Größe und Platzierung die aufgesetzten Taschen vorn auch gut. In die Seitentasche bringe ich auch eine große Trinkflasche (075l-Flsk) - beim Vorgänger (andere Marke) fand hier nur eine 05l-Flasche Platz. Wenn man wirklich auf ganz hohem Niveau etwas negatives sucht dann sind es die Gurtbefestigungen der Träger diese verrutschen mir manchmal d.h. es sind einfache Standard-Plastikteile. Wenn  man ihn immer gleich trägt könnte man die wahrscheinlich etwas befestigen ich trage ihn mal als Rucksack (dann will ich längere Träger) oft auch nur als "Tasche" (dann will ich dass die Träger nicht nach unten hängen) deshalb lasse ich sie verstellbar. Ich habe ihn jetzt seit einigen Monaten im Einsatz und er sieht noch aus wie am ersten Tag würde ihn in jedem Fall wieder kaufen.
5,Muy buena compra igual al de la foto muy espaciosa. De buena calidad la lave una vez en la lavadora y salio igual de bien cuando se seco seguía siendo robusta. Tiene muchos compartimientos y dentro de la mochila tiene un bolsillo especial para ordenador y es bastante grande puede servir para ordenadores grandes. Tiene a los lados para poner botellas y también caben botellas grandes.
4,Ich habe mir den Rucksack für die Arbeit angeschafft. Reinpassen sollten ein 15" Notebook die Lunchbox Getränke ein Regenschirm und diverse Unterlagen - und das ist kein Problem. Selbst als Reiserucksack lässt er sich durch die vielen Fächer gut verwenden. Einen Minuspunkt bekommt er allerdings wegen dem Reißverschluss - dieser klemmt nämlich des Öfteren. Zudem lässt er sich wenn der Rucksack wirklich voll ist schwer schließen. Der Tragekomfort ist in Ordnung für paar Stunden OK. Die Farbe gefällt mir nicht zu auffällig eher Business-mäßig in dezentem grau.
4,Wirklich ein Zaubersack.  Es passt so viel hinein und er ist trotzdem angenehm beim Tragen. Sehr viele weitere Innentaschen und Mappen. Leider ist bereits beim ersten Einräumen eine Innentaschennaht gerissen und schwer nähbar.  Auch Dreck- und Wasserabweisend und gut zum säubern.  Das Design ist gut gemacht und verarbeitet. In der Arbeit  Schule und unterwegs immer dabei und zuverlässig.
5,Super Rucksack für Kurzsbesuche oder das Notebook samt Brotzeit etc für den Gang ins Büro. Passt viel rein Aufteilung ist gut und für den Preis auf jeden Fall weiterzuempfehlen!Endlich keine Notebooktaschen mehr und optisch kein reiner Freizeitrucksack.
5,Backpack as described I love it! Very good quality and material nice elegant and sporty just the right size. Enough front pockets each with two (quality) zips strong side pockets with safety elastic bands. Large main compartment easy to pack easy to see what's in and nice material inside aswel. (Maybe i would put an extra elastic band/strap inside to fix standing a bottle)  In summary it's the first backpack -among a lot- i am very happy with.Re-review in Oct.2020: Ising the backpack continuously carrying in it a lot of material for my work and it's still the best backpack I ever had.
4,I bought this backpack for travelling long distance. When I received the backpack the material was really wonderful quality and it is very neatly created. There are pockets and pockets and pockets for any and every thing. It is quite heavy and I wish the straps were just a bit more padded as once loaded up with your stuff it does hurt if you carry the backpack for a long time.It is lovely and worth the buy. Very practical.
5,Der Rucksack ist sehr schön gestaltet und bietet ausreichenden Stauraum. Durch die vielen Außentaschen lässt sich das Zubehör wie Ladekabel Headset etc. übersichtlich verstauen. Außen sind auf beiden Seiten Vorrichtungen für eine Trinkflasche oder den Coffee to go - Becher die finde ich sehr praktisch.Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Rucksack und würde ihn jederzeit wieder kaufen.
5,...für den Laptop das Tablett Ordner Kalender Kabel und viele mehr. Er ist sehr geräumig und hat viele einzelne Fächer sodass man den Inhalt sehr gut sortieren kann. Ich finde die Öffnung sehr gelungen der Inhalt ist sehr leicht entnehmbar und packbar. Der Rucksack trägt sich sehr angenehm. Die Riemen sind breit genug und gut gepolstert.
5,Ich bin Lehrerin und hatte jahrelang eine typische Ledertasche zum Umhängen. Da ich meinem Rücken etwas Gutes tun wollte schaute ich mich nach einem Rucksack um und bestellte mir zwei zur Auswahl: diesen hier und einen von Windtook. Dieser hier ist nicht zu groß nicht zu klein außen wie innen schick nicht zu sportlich. Ich will ja nicht aussehen wie auf der Wandertour ;-) Die türkise Heftbox ist von Satch die hatte ich dazu bestellt. Sie ist nicht dabei. Aber ich finde sie sehr praktisch.
4,Muy comoda y con mucho espacia
5,Super toller Rucksack mit mega viel Möglichkeit um die Sachen zu verstauen.Der Rucksack ist angenehm leicht und sitzt gut am Rücken.Schön ist auch die Öffnung des Rucksackes.Ich hab lange Rucksäcke beobachtet und angeschaut bin immer wieder zu diesem Model zurück und muss sagen dass ich diesen Kauf nicht bereue.
5,Justo tal como se ve en la foto.Buenisima relación calidad-precio.
5,Auf den ersten Blick sieht alles sehr wertig aus und fühlt sich auch sehr robust an. Sehr viel Stauraum passt eine Menge rein. Nun wird sich in den nächsten Wochen und Monaten zeigen wieviel "Stress und Belastbarkeit" er wirklich verträgt.
5,Sac acheté pour mon fils de 10 ans qui doit prendre son ordinateur à l’école. Il est très spacieux et très confortable malgré le poids du chargement. Ravie de mon choix! Excellent rapport qualité prix!
5,Todo perfecto. Tamaño adecuado muchos bolsillos que te permiten la organización (auriculares ratón cables mvl etc) y además buenos acabados y el interior hay un bolsillo acolchado para el portátil.
5,Ich habe mir den Rucksack gekauft für die Arbeit und man dann auch noch schnell was Einkaufen gehen . Es ist genügend platz vorhanden . Und es war auch alles ganz.
5,La relación calidad- precio parece buena (aun no la he usado) y el tamaño es más grande de lo que pensaba así que para viajar (que es para lo que la quiero) es perfecta
5,I absolutely love this! It is functional has lots of compartments and I can fit in a laptop a big notebook a pair of sneakers gym outfit a small makeup bag my wallet a water bottle with no issues! Not the most stylish but compared to any other functional backpacks this is the best I found!
5,Ein wirklich sehr schöner Rucksack mit viel Stauraum. Ich habe lange nach einem geeignetem Rucksack für meine Hausbesuche als Ergotherapeutin gesucht. Dieser Rucksack ist perfekt. Es geht viel rein er trägt sich super und man kann ihn sogar innen auswischen/desinfizieren aufgrund des glatten Materials.
5,Used for an overnight work trip fitted in my laptop clothes etc with no problem. Large enough for everything and still fits under the seat for hand luggage. Suitcase now retired for work trips! Cannot day enough how much I love this and was asked about it by two fellow attendees!
5,Muy buena mochila. Ideal para llevar el portátil y los documentos. Cabe mucho y tiene muchos compartimentos. La recomiendo
4,très pratique et confortable
5,Sehr schöner Rucksack  viele Fächer... bin begeistert
5,La compre para regalar y esta encantado . Muchas gracias x vuestro servicio .
5,Der Rucksack sieht gut aus ist sehr geräumig und stabil.Empfehlenswert
5,Super toller Rucksack mit großem Stauraum.Dank der vielen Fächer muss ich nicht imerst den gesamten Rucksack auspacken um meinen Schlüssel zu finden 😉Perfekt für die Arbeit!
4,I use this for work and no issues. All folders notebook pens and of course laptop fit great.
5,After looking for many laptop bags that works for my different daily options for adding my laptop clothes books and others. At the same time to be nice looking and small in size. I found all my wishes came true with this beautiful bag. Thanks.
5,Me ha encantado muy practica utilizable genial
5,Super Rucksack. Robust passt viel rein. Und sieht dabei richtig gut aus.
5,Genial grande muy bien acabada y precio increíble
5,This bag is fab. Roomy loads of useful compartments comfy to carry even when fully loaded and I love the top opening feature.  Best work bag I've ever had and good quality.
5,Für einen kleinen Wochenendausflug optimal. Ausreichend Platz und genügend Stauraum. Fürs Büro ebenfalls geeignet wenn man Laptop und Zubehör mit nehmen möchte. Öffnung groß genug um einen leichten Überblick zu erhalten.
5,Me ha gustado buen tamaño gran capacidad y resistencia.
5,Hat alles wunderbar geklappt Qualität war sehr gut für mich war der Rucksack nur nicht der Richtige die Fächeraufteilung die ich benötige war so nicht vorhanden habe mich deshalb für einen Anderen entschieden.
4,een beetje zwaar van zchzelf maar erg handige indeling heel praktisch
5,Le produit est conforme à la description à voir à l'usage
5,Ich liebe meinen Rucksacker ist mein täglicher Begleiter. Alles sicher und gut verstaut.
4,Sac très fonctionnel mais un peu trop lourd. Pour la solidité il semble solide mais il va falloir un peu attendre pour le vérifier......
5,Absolutely fantastic :-)! Great value for money really great 👍
5,Ottima qualità. Preso per viaggiare. È capientissimo e ci entra tutto il necessario per uscite di 1/2 giorni. Davvero uno zaino comodo e versatile.
5,Es geniaaal!
5,Fonction de cartable: me permet de mettre ordi cours pique nique et bien d'autres choses. Chaque élément y trouve sa place. Il reste bien droit lorsqu'il est posé au sol.... il a de la tenue.
5,Der Rucksack ist super. Preis–Leistung passt sehr gut. Er wirkt qualitativ hochwertig.
5,Gran capacidad.
5,Sac très confortable et bien confectionné. Des compartiments bien pensés. Idéal pour protéger les éléments que l'on y range.
5,tres tres beau   bon qualite  semble solide  il ne semble pas grand mais quand on essaie， reellement mettre beaucoup de choses.
5,Nickel
5,Use it for carrying my laptop. Very well made sturdy and great design. Love it
5,Me encantó! Es super espaciosa y ligera! Ideal para viajar con lap y otros accesorios.
5,I bought it as a gift for my daughter. There are a lots of room for her school supplies. She loves it.
5,This bag is very high quality and worth the hype in other reviews. Love everything about it. Looks very professional
5,Great all rounder. Use it for work at present. Can’t wait to try it out for travel
5,I use a backpack instead of a purse and this one is great!! I ordered the dark Grey charcoal colour.  It's very neutral  a man or a woman  could easily use it.  I love the wide opening top! It makes it so easy to see what's inside and find stuff!  The zippers seam solid hopefully it holds up!  First impression is great!!!
5,Straight up the best backpack I've ever owned. It's got heaps of space for my laptop chargers books etc. But it's also got heaps of space to put groceries in when I'm going shopping. I've had 2 people ask me where I've brought it from and a number of friends comment that they really like to look of it. Overall can't fault it and would 100% recommend.
5,This thing is really roomy with great pocket layout. I am seriously happy with it. I didn’t like the two little brown leather accents at all I prefer plain black so I just unpicked the stitching to remove them.
5,Like everything about this.Using as inflight luggage on upcoming flight
5,Great bag. Well made.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Es super espaciosa!!!! ❤️ Me encanta el color y trae un cargador portátil chiquito extra que se agradece. Montones
5,I have loved this knapsack since the day it arrived over two and a half years ago. It is durable and water resistant and still looks really good. I use it every day and the zippers are still perfect and the bag barely shows any wear. I am so pleased with my purchase.
5,I bought this for myself and have received so many compliments. Have ended up buying additional ones as gifts for a few people who all love it as well. Great design sturdy and comfortable to carry.
5,Me gusto mucho cuando la vi pensé que no le cabría todo pero siiii.Súper espaciosa cómoda y bonita.
3,Bought this bag for school as an adult I thought it had better structure to sit up right.. unfortunately when I take my binder out it just falls over (even with something in the front and back). Bit disappointed.Other then that the zippers are nice love all the pockets for organizing I do love how wide the top opens up.Overall I'm happy and excited to use it I've been eyeing this bag for a while. Hopefully I can figure something out to keep it upright when my binder is out.I'll update after I use it for a bit.
5,Bag is so good after I got mine I had to order another for my mother (a teacher) and then once my brother seen hers I had to order him one too!Pros: sufficient pockets stand up on own opens wide deep hold water bottle comfortable I could probably go onCons: haven’t found any yet after 6 months!
5,This bag is huge  like a Pandora's box lol
