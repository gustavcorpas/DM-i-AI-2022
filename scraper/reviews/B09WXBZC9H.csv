5,Very straightforward and I'm a tough grader when it comes to Amazon products because some of the products are a waste of money. But this phone stand is very high quality at a great price. The base is nice and study easy to put together and very functional. My gf has not put it down. I choose this stand because you can turn the phone sideways and it stays in. Very happy with this product A+
5,Surprised by the excellent quality. Best part is the 14‚Äù height adjustment.Would like to have an option to ‚Äúrest‚Äù the phone on as opposed to having snapping it in and out.  Easier access to phone when not filming.  I like to rest my phone on a phone holder the entire time I am at my desk so I can easily find my phone.üòâ
5,I love the Cooper ChatStand for a cell phone. It's very stable because it's metallic and I carry it everywhere in my apartment. The first I bought it for myself then I bought it for my both sons. After I bought three more for my three friends. Everyone is really happy with this product. Also it comes in black and white color so you can choose what you like more.
5,I like this one better than others I have tried/purchased.  The base gives it stability.  The telescoping arm provides flexibility in height.  The phone holder angles easily to adjust bass on background lighting changes (sun setting etc.).  By far the best addition and high value!
5,I was looking for a phone stand for my desk that wouldn‚Äôt take up so much space. THIS definitely exceeded my expectations! Will recommend to anyone who‚Äôs looking for a minimal and sturdy phone stand.
5,It great to keep my phone in one place. And I can watch or talk without holding my phone but I just waist it has a button to adjust to put the phone in and out . other wise I am using it every day.
5,It's the perfect height and it stays in the holder if the stand tops over.  I used to get so mad when I set a stand down and it fell out.  Thank God it doesn't do that anymore.  It stays safely in the stand.  I can grab the stand and my phone won't call out.  I bought another one.  My long search for one finally ends!!  Thanks!!
5,Easy to put together and a simple but sturdy design makes this stand a winner for me. My previous stand was non-adjustable height-wise and easy to tip over.This cooper stand adjusts by height by angle and it rotates the phone 360 degrees. The clamps hold my samsung A52 very securely even with the case on it. Video calls will be a lot more enjoyable with this stand.
5,Sometimes I like to review items I buy online. I find it calming. Like somewhere Eventually someone will read this and it will be as if we are interacting. I don't talk to people much anymore. But when I do I do it by way of my cellphone. Sometimes my hands get tired holding my phone and then I drop the phone. It makes conversations difficult. But then this showed up one day after I bought it and I have found that using this product is convenient.
5,I purchased this stand for use by our hot tub - so I can watch news a movie etc. while relaxing. Sometimes you're not sure of build quality when buying things online but this little unit does not disappoint. It holds my iPhone 13 pro max in it's case and easily pivots for horizontal or vertical viewing. The shelf near the tub was below eye level so the extension brings the phone to the right level. I should have bought two.
5,This is perfect for what I needed! In a world of FaceTime and zoom calls I can pack it in my computer bag and go
5,It holds the phone firmly allows any orientation and height adjustment effortlessly it's sturdy and stable on table not all similar products have these attributes. The appealing packaging is a hint to the quality of the product inside.
5,I initially set this aside because my phone case was too thick. After removing the built-in stand/case I have found this chat stand to be flexible and reliable. It has also helped me keep track of my phone
5,I don‚Äôt know how to put the part that the phone goes in on the stand and there‚Äôs no instructions for that either. Other then that 10/10 recommend. Perfect for zoom meetings  FaceTime. This stand is adjustable and sturdy what more can you honestly ask for ? Just please include the instructions because not everyone is a handy manüò´
5,My Samsung A13 has a heavy case. This product is sturdy and easily holds my phone with its heavy case. The base is metal.
4,I like this stand better than the one I was using but it could be heavier.  Like the previous one I had to use velcro on the bottom to attach it more firmly to my desk.  Not bad though.
5,Easy to use sturdy and definitely worth the money spent
5,Me gusta el funcionamiento es muy √∫til para mi
5,Very convenient
5,love love love it
5,easy to assemble simple to operate sturdy attractive and functional.  Great product.
5,This was exact what I was looking for! Phone can be charged at the same time of use! Very stable design
5,It was easy to assemble and feels substantial like it will hold up well.
5,Buena calidad
5,Excellent product well balanced. I love the extention up to almost 15 inches.. price is a giveaway for this quality of product.
5,Love this gadget!!  Was looking for something to hold my cell phone on my desk without having to pick it up and down throughout the day.  This was certainly a good choice.  You can raise the bar up or down to adjust the height the clamps that hold the phone are adjustable and secure and best of all the phone can turn any way you need it to...like that poor girl‚Äôs head in the movie "The Exorcist." (lol)  Highly Recommend....Thanks!  Todd
5,What a great find! Great weighted base. Easy to use. Nice simple design. I have a heavy phone and I do have to take it out of the case to use this but otherwise it has no issues in the stand. I do live online sales and this has been the best helper to free up my hands! Very nice quality! Good price!
4,Easy to use fairly sturdy great for conference calls
4,Just as described
5,Great product. Personal use
5,Perfect for what I needed it to do
5,Excelente
5,I like everything about this phone stand but mostly how it really holds the phone securely and is very easy to use my phone when it is in the stand making video watching a video or just scrolling.
5,Me encant√≥ lo facil de armar muy bien empaquetado todo en su lugar  con instrucciones en todos los idiomas. Es una maravilla! Lo recomiendo!
5,Muy buen producto
5,Best thing ever  highly recommended!! Is perfect while your eating studying cooking or just like me to read üëçüèª‚úÖ
5,A little difficult to set up but works well. I needed to contact the seller for instructions so I would suggest they put it in the package with easy to understand terms
5,This stand is really good quality. And the presentation was very good. Nice packaging easy-to-read materials with proper grammar. The sellers really seem to care about their products.
5,Love this
5,I love this phone stand  .It does everything suppose too .Great product will recommend it.I will be buying another for my home office.
5,Facil de armar realmente perfecto!!!! recomendado 100%
5,Love everything about this stand.üòä
3,This item is good only if the device it has no case onTo make it better it needs a longer grabber or extendable grip and  another grip on the bottom
3,Se cae el celular.requiere mas espacio.no lo tiene muy limitado.no lo puede agarrar bien.
3,Not ideal for a I phone 13 max but regular I phone and I can assume smaller phones would be just fine.
1,Seems to be a sturdy base but was missing parts for it to actually stand super annoying.& now gotta wait another week for a simple screw that is 100% needed.Won‚Äôt purchase again.
4,I spend 20-30 hours a month on zoom. So I have started using my iPhone (because it has a better camera) as the camera instead of the built-in camera on the Macbook Air (I have the 2021 M1 Macbook air).With the new ios 16 and the Mac OS there is a setting that you can wirelessly connect your phone to your mac as camera and it works great. (I am doing with betas right now).The problem is how to get the phone in the right place so that you don't look like you are looking above the other people on the video call all the time. So you need the cameras on the phone to be as close to the screen as possible. I have tried to do things on my own but finally gave up and got this stand. It is adjustable and I can get it exactly where I want it. When I am working on my computer or presenting then I put my computer flat on my desk and I am looking slightly down.When I am just talking then I raise my computer up about 6-8 inches so that I am looking directly at the screen instead of down at the screen.And this stand is able to manage both positions just fine.
4,The box came a little crushed. it seems to be OK inside. There is no instruction on installation. The little brown bag contains a screw and a small wrench this will allow you to screw to base to the poll. Then you need to take to cap off the holder and press the ball into the holder. Once you know the installation is not hard. I do however had hard time putting my Samsung S21 in the holder as it's very tight and I have phone protector which the edges don't fit totally. Once it's in. It holds tightly and adjust easily. But getting in and out takes some efforts. I  like the look. The base is heavy so it's stable.
5,This holds phones really well and can rotate 360 degrees. The base keeps it from toppling over and it also extends in height. I really like it because it provides much more versatility than the little flip top stands. Very happy and would recommend!
5,I got this because I wanted to be able to FaceTime without holding my phone the whole time and to use while I‚Äôm cooking to read recipes keeping my phone off the messy or sticky counter as I go‚Ä¶ This thing is FANTASTIC! It‚Äôs sturdy and holds my phone at any angle or height I want snuggly. The base plate is heavy but not too big or too small. I want another one in black for my home office!
5,This was just what I needed for zoom calls. It has a nice sturdy platform and I like that the pole adjusts so you can have it low or high. The phone holder works just fine and rotates to get the angle right. This is a nice small stand for table or desk top
5,I picked this stand up to use with my phone in combination with a USB C dock for potentially working exclusively with my phone via VMWare this fell through due to issue with the dock but no big deal.With work we utilize Teams and Jabber for meetings and phone calls. This stand keeps my phone within reach and at the perfect level for video calls and meetings while working on other projects and tasks and freeing up my 3rd display on my desk for other things.It may seem kinda useless in this regard but has come in handy for meetings and presentations while also working from my laptop to handle emergency changes.Solid build quality and wonderful utility make this a solid buy for my use cases and I highly recommend it if you have a similar need.
5,I do a lot of recording from my phone and while sitting at my desk. This is perfect. The sturdy base is great. Fits my phone perfectly. Great height adjustments.
5,This is a great stand for your phone. Assembly is super easy and it comes with an hex key to install the single screw. The base has an anti-skid rubber foot and is made from metal and is heavy keeping the entire unit stable. The rest of the stand is plastic but sturdy. The riser uses a friction fit that has 5‚Äù of vertical adjustment and there is a ball and socket to allow you to adjust the phone position. This is so much better that chatting from a stand that sits too low on your desk. At just 10 bucks you can‚Äôt go wrong.
5,This phone stand is so cool! I love it! It also adjusts which is great for the videos i make!
5,This is easy to assemble and fit my phone perfectly
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Cooper ChatStandUnfortunately my husband I live 750 miles from our daughter and her family.  When we have a call with them it is always on my cell phone and sometimes its a video call with our grandchildren.  I always end up trying to hold the phone out at arm‚Äôs length so we both can be heard on the call or that we are both centered on the screen for the video calls.  This stand will make these calls much more comfortable.It is easy to secure the phone in the stand.  It holds it firmly and touching the phone or stand does not knock it out of place.  It was very easy to assemble using one screw and the included allen wrench.  The part that grips the phone has a strong spring that holds the phone tightly and can accommodate phones of varying widths.  I have an iPhone 12 Pro and this holds the phone securely so the phone can be positioned for photos in portrait or landscape mode with ease. The stand at its lowest height holds the phone at 7.5‚Äù but can extend up to 10‚Äù.The base is weighted and the phone holder is positioned so it is well balanced.  For people who use phones for personal calls or even Zoom business meetings this stand will be a very handy tool.
5,I use this while I am at my desk working on my computer. Super handy to be able to text without picking up the phone off the desk. The stand has a firm grip on my phone no worries of it falling out
5,I ordered this item because ive been doing nails for years and im starting to look into making videos for ig and youtube and tiktoc. This stand was exactly what i was looking for- it holds my phone for me and records videos of me doing nails.Its pretty sturdy easy to adjust and easy to use its a great product
5,Sturdy cell phone stand. Works for any phone except a caseless iPhone 13 mini. The iPhone 13 mini is too small and it slides through the rubber mounts of the mount. However if you do use a case with the iPhone 13 mini then it will hold just fine.
5,The Cooper ChatStand is well made and sturdy. The base and tube are aluminum and the rest is plastic.  It adjusts from about 7 inches to 12 inches high.  This is a  good basic stand for a price you can‚Äôt beat.  I recommend.
5,Great product I like it. Easy and fast install and I like how it got a magnet at the base so when you put your AirPods on top of it it wont fall out.
5,I am a sales rep and I do frequent lives featuring my products‚Ä¶ this is the perfect answer for those quick lives‚Ä¶. Love it!

5,Muy buena calidad recomendable
5,I Use it all the time.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I bought 2 of these. One for my son and the other for myself and I love them! Very sturdy and strong and it snuggly holds the phone. I have an iPhone 7plus and my son has iPhone 11 and the grasp is more of a spring that fits snugly around the phone so no need to manually adjust the size based on the type of phone being held. I'm very satisfied with this purchase!
5,Adjustable height stable and hands free great for watching yt or long chats. Definitely worth the purchased at a decent price.
5,First one came without a screw but the second one arrived in ~2 days and had a screw. Otherwise great product that does exactly what it is advertised for.
4,Nice product and easy to use only down fall after 3 weeks of using last night my neck piece came off when I was extending it hopefully I can have it fix. üáØüá≤
5,I was thinking for the money they are going to be cheaply made was I wrong they are great and so so well made I have one and my wife has one.
4,This chat stand phone holder is a bit bigger than I'd expected It comes in nice protective packaging; it needed assembling by attaching the base of the stand by a screw; that comes with it; the base is quite big; I would prefer it to be a bit smaller.Also the 360 degree moving phone holder needs to be put onto the stand; the phone holder has a screw on mechanism that can be loosened to move and be tightened to lock the phone holder into a position it also has rubber padding on each side to be able to hold the phone more securely.The stand extends in hight and the materials used to make this phone stand is of good quality and  it has a little bit of weight to it incomparison to some other phone holders but it's not heavy. Overall it's a very good phone stand that I enjoy using.
5,Holds firmly strong solid base telescopic to match the height it's the perfect tool for static photography!I've used it for long exposures of seasides for close up portrait shots of interesting bugs and quite a lot of other things.Of course it will work perfectly fine for just holding your phone at your desk too!
4,Arrives in a boring brown box üì¶ with ‚úçÔ∏è  on it. Inside the box üì¶ there is a nice looking booklet. However I couldn‚Äôt find the instructions to assemble it and I could not work it out   so after 5 minutes I looked on this page well I couldn‚Äôt find instructions so I gave up. Ideally I would have preferred it if arrived already assemble.  Due to unnecessary in convenient of this product I can I reward ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
4,I ordered this stand to make it easier for video calls as usually i am leaning my phone up against the bread bin also i wanted to use it for taking tricky picture shots so i can be hands free. It is easy to fix together via the small hex screw and hex key that is included. The underside has a soft bottom that can protect surfaces from scratches and also helps to keep the holder in place.As my phone is on the smaller side i had no problem getting it to hold but the issue i had was the very tight pull out component part i found it really awkward to be honest and snapped a nail whilst attaching my phone! You have to hold one side and then the other side whilst attempting to manoeuvre your phone into place. The phone once in place can be swivelled around in any direction sideways and lengthways and the pole can be lengthened  or shortened to suit.The stand is sturdy and the base has a nice weight to it. Even though i did struggle to attach my phone in place i am going to persevere as this is going to be a handy gadget for me and useful too.
5,The COOPER Chat Stand is not unique I do have a couple that extend or are nearly as tall but it is a slightly more unusual stand than the majority of phone stands out there. Even so it is no more expensive than the plethora of small phone stands/holders available but I think there are few others that are so well built for the money - it's no more expensive than a standard height stand.There is a very minimal amount of assembly required. The base of the pole has a rounded rectangle which aligns and fits snugly into the large flat metal base. A supplied Allen Key is then used to tighten a small chromed screw to secure the two parts. The other 'assembly' is the phone holder to the top of the stand's pole. There's a plastic ball-head rotatable bracket and you should unscrew the collar on the phone holder pop it over the ball head and then push the phone holder firmly onto the ball head. Then re-tighten the collar and adjust to the degree of tightness that you need in order to either lock the holder into a position or slightly looser if you want movement and switchable portrait/landscape phone orientation.The base is plenty heavy grippy with its totally rubbery covered underside and large enough to ensure that the stand will not easily topple even at it's tallest position (the height is simply adjusted by pulling up or pushing down the top section of the stand's pole). In fact I was surprised how jolly good the stability of the COOPER stand is.I love the build quality of this product and think that the manufacturer has come up with a fairly unbeatable value-for-money phone stand that has the benefit of adjustable heights. A top notch phone stand that will be living on my desk for sure! Highly recommended.
5,Cooper ChatStand Height Adjustable Cell Phone Stand for DeskJust what I need to do ‚Äúhands free‚Äù videosThis handy little gadget comes packed in cardboard boxThe stand is adjustable height wiseThe side grippers hold my IPhone XS perfectly and safely in landscape or portrait modeBuilt very well and solidThe base is rubberised so will not mark your furnitureWill also be useful for ‚Äúchats‚Äù on zoom and suchlikeLovely quality and such a good price at approx ¬£10Highly recommend(Hope you found my review helpful)
4,This phone holder does the job quite well. You simply assemble it with the screw it came with which connects to a weighted base.  This does a good job at keeping the stand balanced. It can be height adjusted but not my much.  The clamp does a good job at clamping the phone. I tried it with a s21 ultra and it was fine but slipped slightly when using the case. You can also rotate the clamp so the phone can be portrait or horizontal. The stand is metal but the rest is plastic. Did the job ok and I liked that you can also tilt your phone and angle it.
5,I‚Äôm so happy with this phone stand no more using glasses to support the mobile when talking or watching something on the phone. Very sturdy and simple to put together. Very recomendable definitely something I‚Äôd buy again without a doubt
5,This is perfect for making tiktoks taking photos or content creating. I can easily put this on my table and create content without having to grab my huge and bulky tripod. This wouldn't work for outside photos at different locations as you'd have to stand it on a surface but perfect for day-to-day video and photo taking. Great height build quality and aesthetic too
4,This is far better than supporting my phone against a stack of books. Very solid it works great. Spot on.
5,This is a really robust sturdy phone holder. The height can be adjusted. I have shown the minimum and maximum height in pictures. Holds a phone really well can be portrait held or landscape. Can be tilted when your phone is in the holder. Keeps it securely in place. Great for video calls or watching videos on your phone when in bed like my daughter does
5,I was unsure whether to send for this stand as with most gadgets it is always geared to IPhones or Samsung mobile phones.To be fair though the seller does state in the description fits most models.I have iPhones and android phones as I am a bit of a techno geek.The one I am demonstrating with is my Android Sony 1 (111) and it‚Äôs the tall one. You will need to use without the casing obviously.I can use sideways and lengthways if on zoom or another call.Pull the sides to fix well and turn the knob to fit nice and snugJust ensure before tightening up you can use the phones functions ie passcodes patterns volume etc.Took two minutes if that to set it all up didn‚Äôt even use the instructions as very easy. Don‚Äôt lose the Allen key as needed for the screw on the base.The white base is quite sturdy and feels safe when the phone in situ.Fits the iPhone 6s 7 10 & 11 that is the ones I have tried and also my other Sony XZ3.Really good price and nice to be handsfreeI do recommend because it is made well and so useful.‚≠êÔ∏èThank you to the seller‚≠êÔ∏èI hope my review helps you
5,Perfect for my iPhone 13 and the holder bit is spring loaded so will fit many other phones.Solid and easy to assemblePerfect thanks
5,ADJUSTABLE MOBILE PHONE STAND. EXTENDS BETWEEN 9-14 INCHES IN HEIGHT WITH 360 DEGREE ROTATING AND TILTIN PHONE HOLDER. STRONG STABLE BASE WITH NON SLIP BASE. GREAT FOR READING RECIPES WATCHING VIDEOS ETC. IDEAL FOR HOME OR OFFICE.
5,A good stand for your phone. Very sturdy. Adjustable height. Well made.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I simply hate the pull out mechanism It is really annoying to put a phone in with the case when you have to pull out one side while holding the other then moving the phone onto it I catch my hand in the slots almost all the time and its annoying. I would have prefered it to press a button to open it and then press it together to lock it in place.Aside from that it was good sturdy heavy base easy to install just screw with allen key both provided the neck extends a bit further if you press the button on it sorry I forgot to show you that in the video. all in all was okay I did find another problem with it though which is the grip length isn't long enough and my other phone had trouble clipping on because of the wallet its attached to the grip length should be twice or 3x long and wider and much heavier base then it be able to hold not just phone but tablet and Nintendo Switch too.It was wide enough and held well just for my samsung s6 Edge and older Iphone. I wouldn't trust it to hold my S22 Ultra with a barge pole though.
5,I use this phone stand mainly for videoing my self practicing guitar and ukulele. It just sits on the desk sturdily. The best part is the adjustable height. It can rotate to a horizontal or vertical way . That's exactly what I need. The base and the stand are very well-made. Good strong stand with a heavy base. I do like using it !
5,I am really impressed with this. Its solid has a good weight to the base and the clip is nice and tight. You can use it in a variety of directions and it stays put. You can also carry it around with you and its perfect for zoom.I got the Black one and i would like to see them do a tablet sized one if they did i would buy it again.
2,Quite flimsy and not very good for a bigger phone.
5,Great quality and easy to install. It is very comfortable level when sit on table for a meeting when I work at home. Also to watch films videos when we have meals. Absolutely recommend to everyone!
5,This is an excellent product that has met all my expectations.
5,The Cooper ChatStand has a great build quality is sturdy and holds your phone securely while you FaceTime or in a video call. The height adjustable stand extends more than 30 cm very handy for eye-level video calls. The base is a solid metal design that is weighty and has a thick foam pad on the bottom. The adjustable stand is aluminum that is smooth to extend and shorten. The spring load phone holder holds your phone securely and you have some limited ability to adjust the angle of your phone. You can also rotate it 360 degrees depending if you want your phone portrait or landscape. At less than $13 this phone stand is a great value and is comparable to the quality of the Lamicall phone stand which is nearly double the price.
4,I do a lot of face time and meetings with my phone and up till now it was a bit if a pain to either hold the phone or find something to prop it up. So when I saw this little unit I just had to try it out. The stand arrived quickly and in good shape. Inside the box was the stand in a couple pieces with the manual and a hex key. I was actually surprised to find a hex key included in the box and was a nice touch. Following the manual I quickly assembled the stand and mounted my iPhone X in it. It held my phone very well in both horizontal and vertical orientations. I also tried my wife's iPhone 8 in it and the stand held that very well too. I did find it a touch difficult to raise and lower the phone by extending the back of the stand but I would rather it be a bit on the stiff side than being too loose and not holding the phones up at all. If you are like me and use your phone for face-time and teams meetings or similar this thing is a must and highly recommended! Thank you.
5,Very well made unit.  Easy to assemble.  Perfect as a gift for family and friends.  I use it for work video conferencing as well.
5,Great product great quality good price received quickly works well!
5,First impressions:- Extremely well packaged and made out of recycled materials!- Came with everything required - Allen wrench screw etc- No scratches on any of the parts- Handy instruction manual is ALWAYS appreciatedSetup:- Very easy the clasps open and close quickly and the nozzle turns smoothly both vertically and horizontally- The base is stable and does not fall over even with the weight of the phone- The normal height of the stand is at a very good eye level without any adjustmentsI would absolutely pay $12.95 for this stand and I do think it's a useful investment to help organize and upgrade your space!
5,Great quality. Metal. Heavy base that doesn‚Äôt tip over even with my phone wallet still attached to it
5,The stand is really simple to put together and a great addition to my office. Definitely recommend will be buying another for a family member.
5,Got this for my mom to be able to video call our other family members she kept complaining about having to hold the phone up. I never even knew these existed but it makes so much sense!It comes in a compact package and is easy to assemble. The large base makes it very sturdy and feels well constructed.
5,Nice little phone stand. It comes in 2 pieces and just needs to be screwed into place. The metal is heavy and strong. Not going to bend even when its fully extended.  The clamp is tight but safe for your phone. Its not going to squeeze it rather just hold on with a firm grip. You could throw it in the air and it wont fall out... I tried. The clamp rotates 360 as well up and down roughly 45 degrees either way.Its great for facetime or just watching something on the side while you work.10/10
5,Really well madeEasy to set upHolds the phone really tightly in placeI used it for recipes while I‚Äôm cooking it for watching shows while I‚Äôm cooking so the height is greatOnly slight drawback is that I have a very heavy duty case (otter box) and it won‚Äôt hold the phone with the case on so I have to remove the case not really a big deal for me‚Ä¶Very pleased with the stand.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Got the white version of the Cooper Phone Stand. It‚Äôs a desk phone stand. It can extend to a good height for zoom calls and recording videos.I like the quality of the Cooper phone stand. The material feels good it weights enough to hold your phone in place the parts lock in or connect well (no loose pieces) and the design is simple and modern. It looks nice on the desk and the options of either the black or white version could easily match your desk setup. Keep in mind the pole of the white version is silver. Personally I‚Äôd prefer all white but it‚Äôs fine.The phone holder and the ball head it attaches to is plastic. It is easy enough to put your phone in the holder with one hand. There is foam padding on the holder but I‚Äôd recommend using with a case if your phone is slippery. The ball head allows you to use your phone in portrait and landscape.The telescoping pole feels like light and thin but sturdy aluminum. The pole only adjusts up and down. You can‚Äôt twist it left and right because there are indents to keep you from doing that. It holds up well to the adjusted height.The weighted base feels really nice and sturdy. It could be a nice spot to place your earbuds or watch. The bottom is fully covered with thick foam padding to protect your desk and keep the stand in place.There is space for improvement. The ball head allows for a good range of angles but is still limited. You can‚Äôt have your phone facing higher and lower angles or have it fully perpendicular to the desk. This would‚Äôve been a nice stand for filming almost top down for drawing. Also neither the ball head nor the pole allow you to turn the stand around 360 degrees. You have to rotate the whole base.Overall good quality and useful stand.
5,Put the order in over the weekend and got delivered on Monday. Super fastüòÉ my 3yrs old loves it light weight and steady. He‚Äôs been carrying it all over the place of course with no care‚Ä¶definitely a durable phone stand.
5,A quality product. Works as described. On time delivery. No drama purchase.
5,Good quality product. Easy to put together and easy to use. My phone fits nicely and it is very versatile to use
1,Not easy tu use with big phone arms hard to slide with one Hand.
5,It needs a little assembly but apart from that this phone stand is very solid and stable it holds your phone very well i suggest buying
5,Got it in a day set up in under 10 seconds! It works perfectly for my home office to support my iPhone 13 pro while I zoom my colleagues or check the news. You can also change the height which was a great surprise - I didn't read properly the product to be honest I just liked the look and ordered quickly on Sunday night... I'm thinking my kids could use it as well when watching videos - will give it a try :)Highly recommend!
5,I was tired of holding my phone when chatting with my friends and family so I got this stand and I really like it.It holds my Iphone 12 perfectly I can adjust the height easily and it‚Äôs very stable. You can turn your phone 360 degrees and you can adjust the angle depending on your setup.The packaging is nice and the pamphlets are of good quality so it would make a nice gift it doesn‚Äôt looks cheap and the price is good.
5,Easy to put together. Modern design. durable and reliable. Great value for money. Very happy with this purchase. I use it heaps for Zoom/Facetime calls
5,Pros: compact sturdy simple design functional height adjustableCons: none.Verdict: recommend for those long face time with family and friends. Lol
5,Solid stand.8 inches is about the lowest position and 14 inches the highest.The base is weighted and has a nice foam pad underneath.You don't need to pinch nor press any button to change the position.The head fully rotates in every direction.The clamp that holds a cell phone opens up on both sides adding width.I personally love it.I film things close up and have my hands free.I also use it for video calls.I do have to say it's top quality material and craftsmanship.
