4,Have a home ceiling speaker system  totaling 7 separate connections and this 6 channel amplifier is perfect for my application as it is able to drive them all at the same time. The 750Watt capacity is also just enough for the speaker for turning up the volume without any risk of accidentally blowing out the speakers. Though I have not tired this but it appears to have stereo L and R capability which is also a bonus. Though the instruction manual that came with this amplifier appears to be a little lacking in details so you kind of have to explore how some of the function works. E.g. FM radio.  I am also guessing on the stereo L and R option and I will have to try it out. It would be nice if there was a more thorough manual that came the this amplifier.
4,So far so good.  Fairly easy to hook-up. Using Aux1 and Aux2 and the built in bluetooth.  Range of bluetooth is limited but I do have it in a fairly heavy duty cabinet outdoors which undoubtedly is part of that problem.  Have it hooked up to two sets of speakers. One set on the porch and one on the pool deck. Over all I'm pleased so far.  Have only had it hooked up for a few hours.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Pyle did not disappoint much here. I have this mated to my home Sirius Sat. radio and six 8 inch Polk Audio speakers mounted in my ceiling. This drives them effortlessly. People who come to my house are impressed with the quality of the sound. Of course Polk is great too. I can switch between all inputs instantaneously. Bluetooth volume is a little lower than Aux 1 2 and the üì°.The only real issue I have is; the USB starts up irrespective of whatever I'm switched to and playing when I turn on. I have to always remember to stop it manually each time I switch on. You don't hear what's on the USB but because it's playing you can't start from where you left off when you decide to play the USB again.Besides this everything so far is perfect. I love that I can control the individual volume of each speaker so I can completely customize the sound in my house. For example I can drive the speaker outside my laundry room louder when washing and kill the volume elsewhere if others are sleeping or are watching TV in their room or the great room. In the video I was in a room that has no speakers so the sound your hearing was coming from another room. The line out volume from the Sat radio was at 0 and the gain on the Pyle was at 25% only.I was also surprised that the FM radio on the unit worked inside my house owing to the category 5 Impact glass windows and doors in my house. Great product 5 stars.
4,Sounds good looks good. Display is absolutely useless...
5,I have several Pyle products both inside and outside the house. They work well and this one has the power I needed to push 6 speakers. Installed in my basement bar and now i have no dead spots for sound.
5,I bought this amp and four ‚Äúrock‚Äù speakers to be able to have music outside.  I placed the 4 speakers in two different locations. After burying the underground wires I ran themInto my garage where I placed amp. I set it up so each speaker has a master volume control.The amp immediately finds my phone via Bluetooth.  My phone also provides a volume control. Once I balanced the bass and treble the sound was beautiful. I am very pleased with this amp. It was exactly what I wanted.
5,did exactly what i needed.  Bluetooth connectivity was a bit week but I have other ways to connect so it wasn't really an issue for me.
5,Bluetooth works really good. I like the volume controls and the sound is very good.
5,This receiver has very nice controls and outstanding features plus the power delivery to my speakers are satisfying sounds and no flaws.
5,Simple to use. Works great. I used it in a garage and fit the need.
