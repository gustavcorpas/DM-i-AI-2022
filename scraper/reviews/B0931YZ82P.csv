5,I have only had this dashcam for at most a week now so I will come back to update if this dashcam fails me.I've used around 5 or 6 different dashcams in my 8 years of driving and I have to say I've learned a thing or two about what you want to look for when purchasing one after being burned so many times. I've used a few top sellers on amazon which turned out to be crap. I then tried Vantrue which also ended up corrupting all my files and never saving them after only a few months. Then I got on the OwlCam train and got really burned by it. Not to mention too expensive for such a piece of crap machinery.Now this dashcam I put a *lot of thought* into before buying. I can't stress enough how many times I've been burned. I decided to look based off of the following features:1) is the company that made it real? Like real with their own website?- Most of them aren't but Garmin has been in the game for a while with car products so I figured hey give them a try.2) Can the dashcam connect to an app/my phone? If yes look that app up see it's reviews in the app store.- This camera as of writing uses the Garmin Drive app and this app has 4.5K reviews and 4.7 stars on the iPhone App Store. No other app I could find connected to any dashcam had so many and such high reviews. This gave me hope.3) What is the actual recording resolution of the camera? Some companies lie and it's not actually 4K or whatever they say. Look at youtube reviews with proof of the file format.- Garmin they did not lie to my knowledge. I can see it. I can't read license plates but let's be honest. None of the dashcams you can find will. Maybe some in some bizarre cases but no - don't expect to be able to catch a plate. If something happens just yell out the plate State and Number so you can hear it in the recording later. Also don't be stupid get UNDERinsured driver insurance AND UNINSURED driver insurance. From experience this saved my sister's literal life.4) Can I have a Live connection to the camera somehow?- NexarOne and Owlcam both have these options but fail horribly at them. Garmin has a different version of live and given that this dashcam checked enough of my other boxes I said fine to this. Better not to be forced to pay some subscription fee anyways. Their Live option just requires some internet connection so I connected mine to my house wifi as it sits in my garage. Those who park outside/away from wifi would just have to let it use their phone's data when they are near it instead (which is nice when you are away from home if something happens).Here's my experience so far with this camera:- Placement in the windshield -> I placed it in the center directly behind my review mirror. I can't see the screen of the dashcam because of where I placed it but I don't care personally. It blends in with the black interior of my car you wouldn't know it's there unless you look hard. This is great to not attract as many thieves. It's also SO TINY I am amazed.- Recording--> After trying the different resolution options I picked the 1440p one. It's the highest def. I also am amazed at the 180° view. You can really see the sides of the car if someone came in to t-bone you I am sure the camera would catch it.--> It starts recording as soon as I turn on the engine and I noticed in the video recordings that it ironically records my speed as soon as I throw it into drive. I don't know if this is coincidence or not but I like that it records my speed.--> I like the feature that tells you "Traffic is in motion". Sometimes I zone out at long red lights and this feature is also on my Subaru but it won't be on my new car when it gets here so the fact that the dashcam does it is a huge plus to me.--> It has a feature that beeps quickly at you if you cross a solid line. I think it was created to alert drowsy drivers but I personally don't mind it going off. It's so quick it only takes your attention for a second or two.--> It also has a feature to yell at you if you're tailing someone to close and it could result in a bad accident. Mine has never gone off but I also don't tail people. I think it might annoy someone but at that point don't drive like an ass LOL.- The App & My Phone--> Now I don't know if this thing has a battery in it. I am assuming by it's size that it does not. My car is newer so it turns off all the ports after I shut the engine off. This camera uses a USB (i have usb ports in my car it works with those) and comes with an adapter so you can use it.--> I don't have to have the app open unlike Nexar for example for the dashcam to work. The dashcam basically works on its own and has a great integration with the app. You have options to use it basically (whether you want the app or not). I personally prefer the app as it is easier. I make sure to leave my car in electric mode before I turn it off to double check that the footage was recorded. It's so nice you just connect to the dashcam via it's "wifi" signal and then you can view the footage on the memory card (or you could plug it in to your computer really easily but I haven't found a need to do that).--> On the app you can choose a video that was recorded and upload it to the "Vault" from the memory card in it where if you have a "free" subscription it will delete in 24 hours. You really don't need footage unless you were in a wreck so the only way I could forsee someone being screwed over is if the camera footage is only accessible via the app for some reason (maybe the camera was nearly destroyed in a wreck or something) and the driver was unconscious and couldn't get the footage before being taken away. Then again I could see how you could still get the footage back later because the dash cam won't overwrite footage that's been labeled "accident detected". You're just screwed if your car is robbed and they take the camera with it.--> *AN IMPORTANT NOTE* is that the dashcam will show you lower resolution footage in the app but if you "export" the video it will compile the actual higher definition footage to which you can easily push it to the "vault" (cloud) or to your phone's storage (so the Photos app on iOS).- Things that I didn't expect but love--> This dashcam is the *first* that I've had that can handle how loud I put my music and bass. It doesn't mess the volume up at all. It just lowers the music volume in the recording but my voice is still loud and clear. AMAZING.--> How tiny it is so easy to hide. Tuck the wires for it into your side panels super easy.--> that it uses USB not hard-wiring. Now when my car is in the shop it will still record what's happening instead of needing to be unplugged to do data updates and smog tests.--> that you can connect multiple cameras to your account on the app. If this camera holds up well for 3 months I will buy another and put it as my back camera. They can sync in the app to give you a two in one video with both angles.--> that it doesn't use a suction cup but rather a strong tape so it won't fall off the window on you. You *can* buy a suction cup attachment for 15$ from garmin if you want--> garmin's website has an interactive manual which is super nice and easy to use.TLDR: I did my research so far it's paying off. I hope i don't have to come back and give a negative review in a while when I've been putting it through wear and tear. This dashcam has worked the best out of all I've used but I am a Computer Scientists so tech comes very easy to me. I want to say it's fairly simple for non-techy people to catch on to though.
5,Just installed it in my car played around with the app a little bit and so far so good! One thing that surprised me is just how small it is!! I read reviews of people complimenting the size and discreetness but I didn’t realize HOW small it was until I opened the box and was pleasantly surprised. It mounts well and is pretty well hidden behind my rear view mirror. I have just enough space to hit the save/mic button if needed or I could use the voice commands. I checked from outside and it is difficult to see it especially because it blends in well with the black mirror backing and also the sun glare on the windshield. I agree with another reviewer who said it’s hard to see unless you’re looking for it.As for wire management I had to snake the long wire around the side of my windshield using those tiny Command hooks but I had a bunch on hand because I recently hung up some fairy lights using them as well. They’re clear so they don’t stick out too much and the wire is able to hide snuggly along the window like in my pictures. I ended up routing it all the way to underneath my glove compartment and stuck all the excess wiring between the passenger seat and the middle console.In terms of functionality I’ve only tested it a little so far but it starts recording about 5-6 seconds after I turn on the car and stops right when I turn off the car. I tried the “ok Garmin” voice commands to turn on/off audio recording and also take a picture. In the live view on the app the video isn’t as high quality but I read on other reviews once you save video it uploads to correct quality. Also the picture I took via voice command showed up crystal clear in the app when I viewed it. Could perfectly read my mom’s license plate that was sitting in the garage in front/diagonal left of me. I imagine it would be as good on the road to take a quick pic.Also the beeps it makes are very subtle and satisfying to know that it recognized something. It beeps to turn on/off also when you say “ok Garmin” and then once again after the command following. I could see it getting annoying if you use it a lot but for me it’s very comforting to know that it heard 1) me calling it and 2) what I wanted it to do.I’ve read people complaining about the app and while it’s a little slow it’s not that bad. Like another review said give the camera a minute to connect to your phone when you’re pairing it. I haven’t tested video download/upload speeds yet but I don’t think it’ll be that hindering even if it is slow because the only case you’d want to download videos is when something happens. By then you just gotta be patient the whole process of an accident is going to be stressful and video download speed is not the top of the worry list I’m sure.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The Garmin 57 is great little cam.  I love the size – it’s actually smaller than the EZ Pass (brand name for the transponder for toll roads on most of the East Coast) mounted to my front windshield. The picture isn’t bad - it’s clear enough to read overhead road signs when fairly close to them & license plates (from about half a car length).  The night vision is “ok” – it get’s the job done.  Road signs (being very reflective) are quite visible at night but I’m not really reading license plates at night (I believe my headlights are washing them out.)  There is a setting for “exposure” which I keep at the default setting – perhaps I could improve the visibility of license plates at night by adjusting the exposure.  But for the “bigger picture” (who pulled out in front of who who sideswiped who or who ran the redlight) they’re very effective.I am using a 256 GB micro SanDisc Extreme.  I get tons of hours of driving time - not sure exactly how many hours – Garmin says 256GB will store approximately 18 hours (see Garmin’s chart in my attached pics).  That’s a lot of driving time.  I am using the parking mode & powering the camera through my vehicles OBDC port using an adapter (acquired from Amazon) that allows me to select 5 minutes of parking time or until my vehicle battery reaches 11.6V.The setup for the camera has quite a variety of options that allow you to tailor the operation of the Garmin 57 to meet your needs.  If there’s something you want the camera to do look carefully through the set-up options – it’s probably there.  I am using the driving alerts which I kind of like.  They include lane departure following to closely telling you when the traffic in front of you is moving at a stop light etc.  They’re not bad since I’m driving a Jeep Wrangler which notoriously have very little to no similar  technology.The Garmin App (in my humble opinion) is absolutely worthless – I don’t think it’s possible for ANYTHING to work SLOWER than the Garmin App.  I tried using it on Day 1 gave up & never looked at it again.  Anytime I want to view a file I do it on my PC.  I just pop out the Micro SD put it in the adapter that comes with the Micro SD & pop it into my PC.  The .MP4 files are located in the DCIM Folder & if you specifically asked the Garmin 57 to “Save” the file you will find them in the “Saved” folder or otherwise in the “Unsaved” folder which will be overwritten when the Micro SD is full.  I usually just go to the ”Unsaved” folder & view everything from there using Windows File Explorer. If there’s anything I really want to keep I simply copy it to my PC.  The .GLV files are basically worthless to me at that point – they are just a very low resolution videos - I think intended to work faster with the Garmin APP – so I just delete then by doing a sort selecting them as a group & hitting “delete”.  It frees up a tiny bit of space on the Micro SD but also gets rid of HUNDREDS of files that you don’t need.  When you select a group of .MP4 files go to the top one right click & hit “Open” your selected viewer will automatically play one after another in a “continuous” fashion.  So you could highlight a whole group from a recent trip & watch the trip without touching your keyboard.So in my “title” to this review I pose the question is this device overpriced.  I definitely think it is. I purchased the Garmin 57 over the more expensive models (67W) which provide a 180 degree view not because it is less expensive but because the 180 degree view was too distorted for me.  I watched a super video on YT where the reviewer was showing the videos from each of the cams side-by-side & very quickly took the 67W out of my shopping cart & replaced it with the 57 model. But here’s the reason I think these cams are overpriced.  My home surveillance cameras (Wyze V1 - $25 & Wyze V2 -  $35) (I have seven of them) have a MUCH better image than the Garmin 57.  They have much better detection capabilities and VERY FAST continuous playback through the app.  These are $25 & $35 cameras & I think for the main purpose of a video camera (recording video) these cameras blow away the Garmin 57.  Now you could say that I’m comparing apples & oranges but there are actually people who use the Wyze cams in their vehicles & when it comes to video recording – they get awesome results for a tiny fraction of the price.  If they can produce a surveillance camera for such a low price that provides a better picture these Garmin devices are way overpriced !!!
4,Never had a dash cam before so was a little concerned and read all the reviews I could find.This Garmin Mini 2 fit the bill for what I was seeking.Very small and not able to be seen where I have placed mine from the driver's seat or from the outside looking in.  I have tint on my upper front so I did have to place the sticky pad just below behind my rearview mirror.I used the Dongar plug for my Murano's rearview mirror and 100% absolutely recommend if you have the 10 pin connector. So easy I installed it in... less than 30 seconds really. Hardest part was zip tying my wires together after I hooked it up.Right out of the box simple and straighforward. TINY camera. This is exactly what I wanted. I did not want any LCD monitor to distract me. I mean I can already see out the window I didn't need a screen also. Unit is about the size of my key fob. That's it.I did connect it to my Mac and updated the software and registered the camera before I took it out to the car. I set up the wifi connection to my home so that when I get home it can auto upload to the Vault anything I felt was particularly worthy.Order a 256gb micro usb if you're buying this. It can take up to a 512 but I couldn't justify the extra cost. I doubt I'll need more than the 256 if I'm uploading the worthy materials when I get home. It pops right into the side.Because it is plugged into my mirror it auto turns off and on so I don't have to do a thing. I like that.There are two lights on the camera one is on the side and one on the back which faces you. Because it is behind my mirror it doesn't bother me a bit. But if it becomes an issue I will slip a square of black electrical tape over it to my liking. No biggie.View was surprisingly good. I took the microSD card inside and loaded it on my Mac to see what it looks like. Pretty impressive for a little camera. I can see easily for about 1/8 mile in the country.  In town I can read license plates in front of me. Sufficient for my needs.It does have the audio recording ability which I promptly turned off. I do not want it recording my conversations nor my singing in the car. I feel that's a little too close to an privacy issue for my friends and family. It is a button on the side. It can also be turned off and on by the GarminDrive app on my iPhone.Speaking of which you'll need. It is a decent app that gives you all of the settings and commands you'll need. It also helps get things into the Vault online storage. Only downfall is it doesn't work when the camera isn't on.Vault Storage is a little hinky. Garmin gives you 24 hours of Vault storage for each saved video. If you want to keep it longer than that you have to pay.  An alternative is to take out the card and upload it to your computer where it won't be lost. But if I'm in an accident and incapacitated for 25 hours..... I guess no one can see the video?? I'm not liking that part.  $4.99 monthly gets you 7 days of video storage and $9.99 monthly gets you 30 days.It does have the parking sensor but I believe that it has to be connected to always on power. I did not want that so I've not even checked into it.  My vehicle is garage kept unless I'm in public.  I'm sure it may be very important for others.Overall I liked the price point no LCD screen super easy connection tiny size and video clarity.  Not a big fan of the Vault pricing.Would I buy another? yepWould I buy the Dongar connector next time? absolutely
2,UPDATE: In addition to everything below the app periodically logs you out of your "session" so if you have an accident and want to manually save a clip you might open the app and be told you need to log in again so you have to dig around to find your password. AND you need to receive a verification text message code.Overall it doesn't seem like a good deal for the hardware you get. I kept this camera mostly because I had to. The dash cam market is a mess. I don't want the kind where the display and camera are both hanging down in the middle of my view of the road. I don't know why the standard dash cam design isn't a separate camera you mount to the window and the wire runs to a display/setting device you can mount under the dash.I am going to use the next few paragraphs describing what I think it the worst thing if you plan to use the auto-save features. It seems like an absolute failure from a data-preservation point of view.Marking video to be saved (done by save button voice command or crash detection) saves a separate 30-second video file centered on the time the save was triggered. So if you have a crash at 1:00:15pm you get a saved clip covering from 1h:00m:00s-1:00:30.BUT!......there is now a period of 7 seconds missing from the main video recording right from the point the save was triggered. If 15 seconds on either side of a point in time is not enough and you want to manually select a larger clip to save there will be 7 seconds of reality missing from that new clip. It's like the camera can't handle copying the previous 15 seconds to the new file and also continuing to record new video to the main string of video so it just gives up on one of its jobs for 7 seconds. There is a clock displayed on the video and you will see the video skip ahead and the clock will jump forward.Everything is still recorded SOMEWHERE but 7 seconds of critical time will exist ONLY in the auto-saved clip... which the manual trimming feature of the phone app can't splice in. If you try to manually cut a longer clip in the middle of playback the video will jump ahead 7 seconds. It will not be possible to save a new continuous clip which includes more time before or after the auto saved 30s clip.Suggestion to Garmin: Why not just have the save function mark the current file as protected (along with either the previous or next file if the current time is too close to the beginning or end)?The camera also includes a handy voice command to "take a picture". This saves one frame of the video as a separate picture which is much easier to transfer to your phone if that's all you need. BUT!... this ALSO interrupts the recording process though for only about half a second. While this is much less than the 7 second skip from saving a video you now have a fraction of video fully missing which does not exist anywhere!OK now some various comments:I like having display and controls separate from the camera. It's ridiculous how most dash cameras force you to have the camera and the controls in the same location. I don't know why there aren't loads of dash cams made which have the main good camera on the end of a wire and a display/button unit mounded on your actual dash (or under it etc).App instructions are unclear. To connect to the camera you need to turn on 3 things on your phone:1. Wifi (NOT your phone's hotspot feature wifi like you don't have Internet service but used to transfer videos)2. Bluetooth (uses for basic commands)3. Location (I have no idea why but it won't connect if you don't)The app is mysteriously slow at establishing the wifi connection to the camera but it does not bother trying to connect when you open it. It waits until you do something which NEEDS it. Why not start working on that in the background as soon as I open it?Initial setup was confusing because by default it was set to only use a wifi connection (not cellular data) to upload to the vault. If I am in a crash what are the odds I happen to be connected to an existing wifi spot? I was not prompted to choose this when starting it the first time it was just set to this absurd option in one of the menus.Video quality is medium. Not great for night OK for day. Expected for a midrange 1080p sensor.The included USB cable is for power ONLY. Annoyingly you can't unplug it from the power block and connect it to a laptop or USB OTG adapter to transfer stuff to your phone without wifi. To do that you will need to disconnect the cable at the camera end and use another USB cable.When saving a video clip it is not always clear what is happening. FYI the export screen's status bar means loading to phone. Upload to cloud status is not shown and happens in the background.The clip-cutting setup of the app is great (as long as you haven't lost 7 seconds of time from an auto save). Videos are all grouped with a single icon per day. A day is then displayed as a single timeline and there are sliders you can use to select start/stop points for a clip to export. Tapping and holding the sliders will zoom in on the timeline so you can be precise.Something which makes up for the terrible auto save feature (which I disabled) is that this camera supports HUGE 512GB SD cards. Buy as much memory as you don't mind paying for and you don't have to worry about critical footage being overwritten any time soon. A 64gb card holds about a week worth of driving for me.Accessory note: Garmin sells a separate polarizing filter which reduces glare. For what Garmin wants for this camera they should have included it for free.Cloud storage: If you upload a clip to Garmin's cloud storage they save it for free for 24 hours. You can generate a shareable link to the file and email it to people. They have a monthly subscription option if you want to store videos on their server longer otherwise there is no fee for any features.App warning: You need to be logged into the app to connect to the camera (yikes). Save the password somewhere on your phone.App warning 2: There is an option in the app to set the camera to delete video after only 3 minutes! Make sure this is not turned on. I have no idea what kind of wannabe secret agent is using a phone/web-connected dash cam but also thinks their driving history is so secret it must vanish after 3 minutes.
5,I have the Garmin Dezl 800 GPS for my truck and wanted to get the camera which is 'supposed to' work with the GPS.  I guess it does for the most part.  I know there is a way to connect via bluetooth or WiFi just the camera and GPS - however I have been unsuccessful.The camera is small.  It does have the old style micro USB power plug.  The micro SDXC card is easily installed.  My camera came with a 16 gb generic card which is effectively useless.  It would only store 20 minutes of video before looping back and recording over everything.  I purchased a Samsung EVO Select Micro SD 512GB microSDXC MB-ME512KA/AM and use it instead.  Yes a 512 GB will work just fine.  Once I put the new card in the camera it asked if I wanted to format it - I hit "yes" and the card was formatted for the camera.  Pretty easy.  Garmin does state the camera will work with up to 512 GB SD cards.  If you want to format a new Micro SD card for the camera on your computer you need to format it in FAT 32.The camera comes with a glue on windshield mount or you can purchase separately a suction cup mount.  I got the suction cup.  There is no lens cover so keep your fingers away from it.  The menu on the camera is pretty easy to navigate - which I found amazing.  The default video quality is 1440p 30 fps and sound recording on.  You can password protect entering into menu so only an authorized person can go into any of the settings.  Requires use of a phone.The camera does want you to use the Garmin app Drive.  This connects to the camera and allows the camera to upload video to a data vault.  I do not use this option.  The data vault is a paid service - and I know nothing of it.The camera wanted to update itself immediately when I first connected it to my laptop - it uses another Garmin app to register itself then download the 2.80 software.  There are a bunch of other language and mapping software that can be downloaded.  Was actually pretty easy to do the update.Overall - I'd say the Garmin v67 camera is pretty good.  Its geared more toward fleet vehicle operation.  You can use it on your own if you like.  Don't ever expect to view any video from the built in 2" screen because it just not possible.
4,I had some problems getting the camera properly connected to my phone without losing the audio channel through the speakers. It took a few tries and some reading but I got it all going on my phone.The camera is tiny and difficult to see especially if it's around your mirror. It has a red light that shows it's running.You can use voice commands to save a video clip or take a still image with the camera.If you want to see what you're capturing in real time you can open a WiFi hot spot with your phone and connect the camera. Storage is limited to space available on your device unless you get a storage subscription.Garmin holds your video for 24 hours. They charge $5/month to keep video for a week $10/month to keep it 30 days.I'm pleased with the camera. It's physically simple to install easy to adjust and image quality is acceptable.
4,UPDATE 30+ days laterThe app is pretty stable unless you need to review a video where you need to connecti via the wifi from your phone. Reboot both device and your phone seems to be needed to guarantee it connecting. To download the videos either you have the Garmin unit powered on for an extended period of time so it has time to upload to the Garmin vault or pull the SD card and extract with a PC. On about three occasions the device does not boot up properly. A force power off and on fixes that. My other non-garmin non-wofo capable dashcam doesnt seem to have this issue. Via the app the Bluetooth connection means you can command dashcam to take a photo or save a video. The use of hey Garmin doesn't work if there is a lot of ambient noise (e.g. driving above 40 mph with windows closed and HVAC on). So be mindful when considering all of thosw features. I did add a polarized lens and I still recommend that however it is over priced but the form factor is what I liked about it while not having to make my own.It's not very noticeable. I decided to buy the over priced polarized lens as driving towards the sun is challenging for these tiny camera. When you unbox the unit be sure to insert a SD card before trying to connect directly to the device which is required to upgrade or remote view. Like others have said if there is a lot of ambient noise like high fan speed loud radio playing or Windows open the voice recognition can be challenged. I wanted a dashcam that I could access via an app and that the app is China-sourced. The app did not require ridiculous permissions and support should be pretty decent. I do own other Garmin products like their smart watch so I expect the same level of quality. What's unclear before buying was what comes in the box. It comes with two cables lone and short. The long cable was able to go from the center top of the windshield to the driver side fuse box. The cable is extra thin which make it easy to route around the pillars behind the dash and center console. The box contains a two port cigarette lighter plug plus another shorter cable for updating the device's firmware via the PC and Garmin express or for downloading stored photos. Since the camera is wifi capable if it's in range with a wifi network it can upload recorded videos and photos up the vault. I preferred to have a 4k camera but the price delta was not worth the extra resolution and the detection features the fancier units provided. Unlike in the other vehicles where I have front and rear recorded I am using the mini-2 as the front camera.
5,Although I wish it was 4K resolution the Garmin Dash Can 57 is exactly as advertised and I'm very pleased so far. The Garmin Constant Power Cable that connects to my OBD-II port also works perfectly. Concealing the wires in my roof liner and panels took less than a couple of minutes. The 140 degree field of view is perfect. Decided not to go with the 67W because of the extreme "fish eye" effect the 180 degree field of view creates. The constant power cable allows me to keep recording 24/7 even after my car is parked which is a nice piece of mind. I also keep a wifi device in my center console that stays connected to my Garmin which allows me to remotely view my dash cam from my phone wherever I am. The voice controls work great too.
5,I spent a few months trying to find a small cheap yet good quality dash cam and after doing a lot of research I settled on this. I have to say it is easy to setup download onto computer and the best part I like is the app that syncs to your phone so you can see what the camera is seeing.It is nice and small so very inconspicuous whether you are looking at in from the outside of the car or the inside. Pictures quality is not the best of the best but it is definitely serviceable and can make out the important information such as signs and other vehicles license plates.The packages came with an extra suction cup and with another micro USB to USB cable you can easily move this camera between two vehicles if you wish with minimal effort.
4,So overall I am happy with the camera I just have a few small gripes.the good - decent image (only 1080p) easy to use interface reliable connection for reviewing and dowloading video (my old camera never gave me one clip I really needed so its a huge improvement there) It works well with the dongar usb adapter that takes power from my mirror so I don't have to wire a cable through my headliner and A pillar.I was also worried about it having no screen but its really not a big deal and I actually prefer it since it helps keep it lower profile.The bad - no included SD card. It mentions it in one of the pictures in the body of the listing but it should also be listed in the bullet points to be extra clear if you don't look at every picture you won't know it doesn't come with it.Also the LED is super bright at night. It doesn't dim compared to daytime. During the day its barely noticeable but at night if the camera is in your line of sight its very bright. Luckily its mostly behind my rear view mirror so its not too bad for me but as a passenger it would be annoying.No USB C - I think they kept it micro usb to keep in line with their other accessories but in todays world I would rather have usb c but its not a huge deal.Since its not a wedge style camera you do get a bit more glare compared to other cameras that get closer to the glass but its not a huge deal. You can get a polarizing filter for it but haven't tried it yet.
5,After watching so many youtube videos of car crash compilations I decided to look up the best dash cams on the market and was recommended by a couple sources (tech radar etc.) on this particular dash cam. While the price is a bit high compared to other products I'd say it's worth the cost for the high quality video and reliability of the product to essentially insure/protect your car from any insurance scammers/sticky situations. After all I would be appalled to find out that if I had bought a cheap dash cam by a weird company that it didn't work/failed to record after an accident that might just ruin my insurance costs.
4,Finally! A really small dash cam. I have no idea why they are all so huge with screens and everything. For those of us who just want simple recordings...set it and forget it and not looking to play around with it all the time like it's a Go Pro or something.I tried a Thinkware front and rear cam setup. The experience was horrible. Especially with the app. This is so much better! I bought 2 of these  Garmins one for the front and one for the rear. Used one of the included dual outlet USB plugs (which I have a 12v socket wired at the fuse box under the dash). The app connects them super easily pretty much by itself. The Thinkware was so difficult to connect and you had to repeat the process every time.These are so small simp!e and high quality...and the price is great too! Dual 12v outlet 13ft power cord 4ft power/data cord very simple instructions and an extra mount(not sure why or how you would use this) all included. Also a very good and easy to use app that's very intuitive. Put in and format your SD card stick it to the glass plug it in and you're ready to go.  The voice  commands are excellent. And work really well. I Highly recommend this cam.3 things they need to fix:There is no way to dim or turn off the indicator lights.There is no way to choose what audio indicators to have active i.e. disable the power on/off sounds but keep the voice command sounds.There is no way to rotate the image in case you need to mount a cam upside down (or even sideways). The Thinkware had that for the rear cam.I hope they fix these issues with software updates. I will definitely come back and change my rating to 5. Even 6 if I could.
4,Good video quality but I was honestly hoping for better 2K or 4K video quality with the price I paid for this little piece of thing. On a sunny day the video quality is nice. But I can't clearly read some license plates from about 2 or 3 car lengths away. At night the video is alright. Not the best but it's good enough. This is my opinion only. Garmin fans please don't hate on me. The video quality is my only gripe. I do like the small size of the dash cam as it doesn't interfere with your windshield vision unlike other bulky dash cams out there. I also like that it's able to take in 512GB micro sd capacity. I also like the little magnet the dash cam sticks to. It's convenient to take the dash cam off and place it back on the windshield. The little magnet has a glue on on side that sticks to your windshield and the other side is the magnetic side that sticks to your Garmin 67W dash cam. It's a very strong magnetic grip and you don't have to worry about your dash cam moving around. The dash cam can also connect to the Garmin Drive app via bluetooth connection. I don't use this feature since my videos are stored locally to the 512GB micro sd. But if you want to transfer videos instantly to your phone then you can use the Drive app to do that. I also like the voice control of the dash cam. You can say "Okay Garmin..." then you have option to take a picture or save video. I haven't bought the parking cable or the OBD2 constant power accessories for this dash cam. At least not yet. Maybe I will in the future.
4,It takes so long to get this to sync the live cam to the app its crazy. I spend 20 minutes every few weeks making sure its adjusted correctly it seems.  Works great when it's filming and all but the app is garbage and having to sign in is even more stupid.
5,A very good video quality and dependable in the sense that once the recording mode begins it will record as long as there is a space in the memory card. I don't like the fact that Garmin piecemeal the product by selling forward camera and then sell rear view camera and then rear facing camera etc.
4,This camera is small light and easy to set up and install.  It works by voice control or with the use of an app.  The connectivity with the app is probably the best because the voice control sometimes is slow and it gets confused at what you were or are requesting.  The overall image quality is not too bad from such a small extremely wide angle lens and overall I am happy with it.
5,I bought two Garmin Mini 2 dash cams and installed them in front and back of my car. I bought them because they are basically "set 'em & forget 'em" coverage are small/unobtrusive easy to use and install. They worked perfectly.  Three months after purchases I was involved in a highway accident at nighttime in an area that was under construction yet had no safeguards. My car was totaled and I broke my neck among many injuries.Apparently I was the second accident that day in the same spot. Construction continued and the area has since changed. Thankfully my Garmin preserved the circumstances on video and I can prove my case in court and get my medical expenses covered.When I originally made the purchase my husband was irked because he thought it was an unnecessary expenditure. NOW he says I was brilliant to have thought ahead. I'll never go without a dashcam again. There is no reason NOT to have a dashcam. My next dashcams will definitely be Garmins.
4,Video quality is good enough. I like the voice activated controls especially the audio option so you can record a license plate or conversation with someone (law enforcement etc). Easy to install and I like the small size.How it could be 5 stars:1. 4k video2. Allow videos to wirelessly transfer to phone (currently only way to access video is by removing the memory card or purchasing a subscription to their “vault”)3. Improve the app
4,Camera quit working after 5 months. It started to continually turn on and off. I tried a lot of troubleshooting only to waste my time. I called Garmin and they said they would replace it after I returned the broken one. Life got busy and I forgot to remove the SD card before mailing the broken camera back to them.  I called Garmin and they don’t have a way to communicate with their warehouse or to return the package to me so there was no way to get my SD card back. They have poor internal communication. I am probably not the first person to forget to remove the card before returning a broken camera.  If the camera didn’t quit working I wouldn’t have had to return it. However  I did get the replacement after about one week. We will see how long this one lasts. Also when connecting to the camera via the app I have had the app randomly close a few times. When the camera and app does actually work it is pretty good.
5,It’s likely the best camera on the market. It’s very small but has a great sight picture. Installation was easy. I haven’t got the camera to connect to the app yet though.
5,I initially bought both the Garmin Mini 2 for my rear window and the Garmin 67w for the front window.  The Mini 2 is great it's tiny picture quality is excellent definitely get it if you're considering that.But the 67w is not good.  The 180-degree view was nice capturing the sides and all.  But the picture quality was horrendous.  It was pixelated and grainy and it was difficult to read license plates.  I knew it was definitely an issue with the camera itself as the Mini 2's picture was much crisper and clearer.  And yes I did update the firmware and am using a SanDisk High Endurance SD card and whatever other excuses Garmin Support might suggest.So I bought a 57 and the 57's picture is much crisper and clearer than the 67w (just like the Mini 2). The downside of course is no 180-degree view but obviously the 180-degree view is worthless if the picture itself is poor.  As an added bonus the 57 can support Garmin's polarized lens cover to cut the glare (which the 67w can't support).I am keeping the 57 and will be returning the 67w.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 the good .. super simple to use and operate ... the bad if license plates of cars going by is a must  this camera doesn't quite have the resolution required to get a good id of the plate ... quality of image is good  but i expected to have better definition of the plates  ... unless you stop behind someone 5 feet in front of you  it gets sketchy trying to read plates. ... other than that it's great  ... i can never remember the phrase to capture events  but the bottom button is quick and easy to find if you remember to do it as soon as an event occurs  ...video of someone pulling right in front of me attached .. it was close enough to engage the collision avoidance on my truck ... can you make out the plates ? the mustang to my right  frame by frame maybe .. the others ..not so much ... ps. camera set to max resolution.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I like the feature set available for this camera in terms of the level of customizability.  I installed this in my wife's car (2018 Subaru Crosstrek) and initially she rejected it because it was regularly beeping at her and otherwise making noise.  I was able to go in and shut all that off without compromising the ability of the camera to passively record what is going on around the car.The camera is also quite small (maybe 1" x 2") so I could easily tuck it up behind the rearview mirror so she also cannot see it while she is driving.The default view of the camera includes a full 180 degrees of visibility which is both good and bad.  Good because it can see nearly everything the driver can and bad because it distorts the image somewhat and also takes the notion of "objects in mirror are closer than they appear" to the extreme!  For example I captured the attached video on a short test drive after replacing the struts and springs on the car and the oncoming Toyota Tundra doesn't look very close to my car at all.  It was quite close in fact.The ability for it to obey voice commands is nice and it is very responsive but I doubt I'll use them to "save video."  Unfortunately when you do that it actually clips a chunk of time from the general timeline and saves it separately (rather than just having it both as standalone and in the general timeline).  As such if you want to build a video from the footage using a longer duration than the "saved" video you cannot do so easily or without a timeline interruption.  To that end I recommend using a 256G microSD card.Overall for the cost I think this one is a keeper.
4,I’ll start off with saying that all around I’m very happy with this camera. I was using a cheap cam before and was having a lot of issues with it so I figured I’d shell out the money to get something a little higher quality. I could say some nitpicky things about it see the pros and cons below if interested but all in all it’s a great dashcam.Pros:-Easy to install-GPS-Screen is big enough you can see and navigate it just fine but it’s not distracting while driving-Garmin Vault is nice it uploads the videos when connected to wifi and stores them for 24 hours—just make sure you have wifi connection where you park your car-I noticed sone complaints about the app but it works fine for me so far and has some features I like such as the live view. I think it just could use a little optimization though-All around feels like a quality productCons:-A little pricey and to store footage in Garmin Vault longer than 24 hours it’s either $5/mo to store for 7 days or $10/mo for 30 days-I haven’t gone for much night driving but from what I can tell the picture is a bit grainy at night-The included microSD card is only 16GB so you might have to purchase a larger card if you want to be able to store more footage-If you want to hardwire install it you need to purchase that kit separately and it only works with the Garmin brand “Parking Mode Cable” so no third-party installation kits.
4,This is the smallest dash cam on the market right now so it can be mounted inconspicuously in some cases between the rear view mirror and the windshield. That was not possible in my case but it’s still non-obtrusive where I mounted it. (See picture) Like virtually all Garmin products it’s relatively user friendly with only two buttons and it can be also operated by voice commands. I have found that although the voice commands work fine when parked normal noise on the highway prevents them from working reliably. But the written instructions that come with it are really inadequate—and that’s also typical of Garmin products. The best source of “how to” instructions is in their website videos and in private videos on YouTube but not with what comes in the box.On the plus side it takes clear pictures with a wide angle lens that doesn’t distort excessively. (See picture—that’s a Wyoming ground blizzard)) It also comes with two mounts as well as two connecting cables. I was able to put one mount in my car and the other in my Class B motorhome and to make use of the longer cable in the car and the shorter one in the motorhome. The mounts have an incredibly sticky and strong adhesive.  It’s quite easy to remove the dash cam from the mount and pop it onto the mount in the other vehicle. So far neither mount has loosened from the windshield.One major complaint: it has two LEDs to indicate that it’s operating—and they are incredibly bright and annoying even in bright daylight. I found it necessary to tape over most of the primary LED’s lens—still visible but only a tiny part of it. Garmin should include some way of dimming the LEDs but if they do it’s not in the instructions. Perhaps it would be less annoying if it had been possible to mount the dash cam behind my mirror. But with most newer cars having electronics boxes behind their mirrors my installation will be pretty common I think.One last comment: it has a “ding” sound whenever it turns on or off or starts a recording. I’ve read of others who found that annoying but compared to the other warning sounds in both of my vehicles it’s pretty unobtrusive.The reason for my overall 4 star rating is the inadequate instructions and the excessively bright LEDs. Garmin can do better.
4,1st PROBLEM: I had trouble formatting the micro SD card on my Mac.FIX: Garmin rep said you have to have powered through the car. Formatted quickly and connected to WiFi quickly.FIRST DRIVE: Worked well! With the car on the App showed multiple vids it took so success!CON: I don't like how the app asked to 'connect' to the dashcam each and every time. APP is VERY slow.ALL IN ALL: seems like a good little dashcam for cheap and installs very easily. Look up the OBD2 cord on amazon. Works well to power it!
4,I purchased the filter to go with it because it was a little too bright.  It does take a few minutes to get it connected to your phone.
5,For the money it's not the best nor the worst.
5,I bought the Garmin and Nexar NEXC1 at the same time for my wife's and daughter's cars. I think both have the same quality picture at least during the day. I haven't looked at any night time videos.The Garmin is great in my opinion because 1) it is so small you can't even tell it's there 2) no app on your phone is needed and 3) I know how to manually save videos!The Nexar is big in comparison and doesn't fit in front of the rearview mirror as the Garmin does. Nexar's documentation makes it sound like you have to download their app to use it. And I'm not sure if I'm saving pictures or videos when I place my finger on the Nexar. It's not a physical button and doesn't always trigger. This isn't a problem for the Garmin because you can use your voice to save videos.I really wanted a "set it and forget it" dash cam that my family wouldn't mind.I think the only thing the Nexus has that Garman doesn't is a suction cup instead of just a sticker. But the suction cup is very large and the sticker has held up so far without issues.
1,Update: I decided to try a replacement Mini 2 since Garmin thought it was just a defective camera.  I put the memory card from my 57–which has never reported an issue—into the Mini 2 and within 24 hours of recording this Mini 2 had the same issues as the last (reports that the memory card is slowing down and requires formatting).  I was hoping to avoid the bulk of another 57 but I suspect I will be making that exchange soon.—I have a Dash Cam 57 for a front camera and a Mini 2 for the rear camera which I am returning:• 57 video quality is acceptable (can somewhat make out plates that are within a car length)• Mini 2 quality is less acceptable (unlikely to get a plate number unless placed at the bumper)• Either are better than the 67W (wide/fisheye) which makes everything seem far away—distorting distances for incident purposes—and makes identifying a plate nearly impossible at the resolution of the camera• Voice controls work well as long as you are within 3 feet and not in a downpour/on the highway/playing music/etc.; otherwise expect to shout• Though their marketing and app would lead one to believe that there is some coordination across the up-to 4 supported cameras in “Drive” there is no support beyond the export of picture-in-picture video—if both happened to be within earshot of you using the activation (“Garmin”/“Dash Cam”) and “Save Video” commands; otherwise you have to have a large enough memory card and hope you can go back in history to retrieve the individual camera recordings (spotty at best—many are unretrievable via the application despite showing in the history list though they can normally be recovered using a computer)• The incident detection works [mostly] but otherwise you have to be within reach of the camera to press the record button within earshot (as mentioned) or using the app but this often does not connect and requires repairing which isn’t going to happen driving down the road• This means that a camera in the back of a truck or large SUV will not work well except for incident detection (sudden deceleration/bump) or if retrieving from history (if able to)• Bluetooth connectivity (for settings) is reliable on iOS 15; WiFi (for video retrieval/live view) is completely unreliable and requires ridiculousness to work (only works on a fresh boot of the phone after clearing pairings and shortly after booting the cameras); did not test WiFi hotspot (for video upload)• Both caneras are the current generation so they have Garmin’s vault support though that offering seems to provide little value—at least for my use case—and at a reasonably high cost for very short-term cloud storage; vault usage is not mandatory• Parking guard is mostly useless (with constant power from OBD2 or another 12V source) because it only detects when someone smacks into your car (low sensitivity=virtually no detections; high sensitivity=false positives and a memory card that gets filled up); if you opt for splicing/piggybacking in the parking cable it adds a motion detector that will quickly fill your memory card (no incident recording at that point) if there is actually any volume of movement around (it is an old school/non-computer vision based solution and very inefficient)• The OBD2 power solution is decent and has settings (a physical switch) to keep the camera on for 10 minutes 24 hours or indefinitely after shutting off the vehicle—down to the preset low voltage level; however the power state can get out of sync (e.g. with remote start if entering and exiting the vehicle multiple times if switching between accessory and start more than one time etc.) meaning the cameras go into parking guard instead of turning on when starting a drive; sometimes one will be on and not the other (would be wonderful to find this out after an incident)• The Mini 2 gets ridiculously hot no matter what power source is used (12V power point/cigarette lighter adapter OBD2 adapter or computer USB)• The Mini 2 continually says that the memory card is slowing down and needs to be formatted (typically within 24 hours of recording) and this is on the latest firmware (released Dec. 2021); the card is a brand-new freshly-formatted high-end Sandisk Endurance Max 256 GB which is stated to be compatible with their cameras; the same type of card has no problems in the 57• The polarized filters provide little improvement with glare issues• The suction cup mount is not compatible with the angle of the Mini 2• And if the above weren’t enough they decided to raise the prices $20 (inflation/profit opportunity?—you guess)Dash Cam Mini 2 is unreliable at best and a waste of money at worst.  Just look at the other negative reviews for the Garmin Dash Cameras combined listing on Amazon and note how many are for Mini 2 purchases (most).  The only reason why I would recommend the 57 (and only the 57) is that the image is acceptable and non-fishbowl the Vault functionality is optional and Garmin’s app and policies appear more trustworthy than the import camera apps and policies.  I might get a second at Garmin’s new ripoff pricing to have a rear camera that—you know—works… at times.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have owned several dashcams over the years.  Some more expensive than this others less so.  In the end I frequently find myself recommending Garmin simply because they are devices that work well and that you can depend on when the time comes where you really need that video footage.Everything on this works well and I can not overemphasize the importance of that.  Other units may look cooler  may have more features  or may claim better resolution.  That is great but many of those are riddled with glitches and may fail you when needed.This unit offers everything most users will ever need.  High quality images fast and accurate GPS wifi and Bluetooth connectivity that actually works an app that actually works and more.The form factor is very compact and it has a great mounting system.  While I like the look of some wedge units I find it much easier to actually use the screens and buttons on the Garmin.  Likewise the menus and UI make sense and are simple to navigate.There are also some well thought out touches such as providing two cables which point in different directions to accommodate wher you have mounted the unit.  I wired it to my overhead panel using a 12v to USB converter.  There is a separate hard wire kit available.The Garmin has a battery which will last for about 30 mins without power.  One nice thing this enables is short term parking monitoring without being hardwired to constant power.  I do not park outside overnight so this works great for trip to grocery store etc.  No worries about draining your vehicles battery.I do not use the Lane Assist or collision warning as my vehicle already has this feature.  I have used it with other vehicles and it mostly works well with a bit of excessive nagging.One nice thing with the Garmins is that you can run multiple cameras and it will keep them in synch.  No need to hardwire them all together.  This makes it easier to install a multi camera setup.  I will be putting a mini at the rear hatch.The video is excellent during the day still very good at night.  You can mostly read license plates.  I am attaching some video but note that posted videos have lower resolution.  When you view the full res videos they are very impressive.Again everything simply works well which is the most important factor when selecting a web cam.  It is backed up by a proven and reputable manufacturers.  Others may claim better PQ or offer space alien detection mode.  Decide what is most important to you and go from there.
5,We got this as a gift for our son.  He seems to like it.
4,So it took me maybe a half an hour to do the wiring myself with a USB extendor. The camera catches cars and things around.I got the same front and back so it's nice to use one app.All the cameras on the market only capture licenses plates when they cars are in certain positions. I was debating dropping more money to get a high quality camera that would capture a licenses plate but from message boards and reviews they dont work in all situations. My solution is get a camera that's decent and shout out the license of who ever hit you. I got the lens for the front but not the back. Don't pay over $20 for it.You can turn off the beeping but the lights at night make it obvious that something is recording. It pays for itself if you get into a accident.In a month I caught a instant karma police pull over and many idiots. I think its worth it.
5,Camera arrived perfectly as expected. I purchased this camera in preparation for a cross country drive. After mounting and sorting out my wire tuck nobody even notices the camera. I have mine set to extreme sensitivity and it works great. Asuiron and visual are crystal clear.I can review any saved clips directly on my phone.I might be getting a second one for my motorcycle!!
3,First off it's smaller than I expected. It's very easy to hide behind your rearview mirror and the mount is adjustable so you don't have to worry about getting the sticky side mounted exactly straight like other dash cams.The magnetic sticky mount has a very small surface area however and I worry that a hot summer day will make it fall off the windshield. That said being that it is magnetic it's super easy to remove and remount when needed.The lane departure forward collision warning and the alert when traffic in front of you starts moving all appear to work flawlessly so that's definitely a plus.But here's the bad...1. The camera only saves videos in 30 second increments and only when you push the button to save one. When you push the button the previous 15 seconds and the following 15 seconds are combined into one 30 second video. If you push the button again before the second half of the recording is completed it will start a second recording so you'll have two overlapping recordings. There is no way to make this time increment longer and there is no way to make the camera record in loops like most other dashcams. That means if something happens and you forget the push the button or can't continue to push the button every 15 seconds you'll lose all of that footage which is crazy to me. That said it will detect a crash and automatically save a video or "event" but even then I'm fairly sure it only records 30 seconds.There is an option to make time lapse types of recordings but even those aren't really useful when you have something happening in the 1-5 minute timeframe and don't want to have to hit a button every 15 seconds.2. Video quality. For over $200 I was expecting a little better from this camera. I bought it because of the brand but my old 4k Rexxing was better BY A MILE. I changed to the Garmin though because of the constant issues with the app and the camera working / connecting to my phone.  I have downloaded videos from this device and reading license plates is virtually impossible unless the car directly in front of you is stopped at a red light.And here's the good:The app... The app... The app is on fire!! I've owned a few dash cams and the apps and methods of getting video off of them is like pulling teeth. The Garmin drive app however is fantastic and is enough to make me recommend this to friends. There really isn't a better one out there!***************************All that said if you want really good video quality that records in loops and don't mind dealing with a finicky app or removing the memory card when you want to access the videos go with a Rexxing.If you're looking for a fantastic user experience on the camera and the software/app some safe driving features and your speed stamped on your videos go with the Garmin!
5,Does what it needs too. Super small so it doesn’t attract thieves.I just plug it straight into the lighter plug and let the cable hang.
4,So I've owned multiple dash cams in my life that have made promises of helping me out to only be fooled into having broken windshield decoration when I needed it the most.After weeks of research I ended up settling with the garmin 57 for a couple of reasons.1. Ease of set up2. Picture quality3. Parking mode feature4. the ability to pull footage off the camra to my phone5. quality constructionAll of these things are what my previous dash cams also boasted but sadly couldn't live up to. The reviews on YouTube for this camra said this could do that and more.I gave it 4 stars as I was able to test 12 and 4 of my points above out and the reviews on YouTube held true and the 5th looks to be correct but only time will tell.At the year mark of having this product I will come back and update my review. To see how points 4 and 5 have worked out.
5,Records well so small that's not in your way
3,The devices themselves are great.  The picture quality is clear and accurate.  The voice control and vault features are great.  This would easily be a 5 star product if not for the horror that is the app.  It genuinely is terrible.  When setting up the cameras it can be a crap shoot.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  However the real issue comes when trying to connect to the feed to live stream a camera.  On average it manages to connect 2 our of every 10 tries.  Things that help are clearing the app cache restarting the phone or restarting the camera itself but there really is no guarantee that any of those will work  Also exporting clips in unbelievably slow.  It's much easier and quicker to eject the SD card and plug it into your phone using an adapter.Overall I've purchased four of these cameras for two cars because they're convenient and unobtrusive but when it comes time to get new ones I definitely won't be sticking with this brand.
5,I bought this for my son who is an over-the-road truck driver. Two weeks after putting this in his truck a car pulled out in front of him and he hit the car and demolished it. The camera caught everything. Hopefully the other driver was uninjured and maybe learned not to pull out of a line of stopped traffic without looking and not to pull out in front of a moving semi. "Stupid should hurt". People don't realize that a loaded semi weighs up to 80000 pounds it cannot stop on a dime like a car or pickup. Thanks to this accident and this camera the company that my son works for is installing cameras in all of their trucks.
4,I have a 2017 BMW- the USB port is located in the back center console closed compartment  and the cigarette lighter is in the front center console. No way to hide the wire to get to USB so mud use cigarette lighter. The one that came in the pack- does not work! Don’t know if it’s not deep enough but is not functional. Had to get another cig lighter adapter; camera works fab but when I look at live viewIn iPhone it disconnects or messes up you car connection to your phone so if you r navigating using the maps. U can’t drive and watch the live view to aim the camera cause it messes up ur car connection. But all in all a gr8 camera; easy connection although it took a few tries; easy app to navigate; love the voice control. Just need a different cigarette connector!
5,Installation is easy sleek as an Apple product so far so good but will see.
3,This camera is nice and small and was easy to install. I ended up returning it though because Garmin has begun to use a confusing new term for their parked car abilities.Some cameras from Garmin include “Parking Mode” which allows you to setup the camera to be trigger by either an impact to your car or when it detects motion in the video frame.This camera and many of the newer models only include “Parking Guard”. Parking Guard is NOT triggered by motion detection and will only record video if it detects an impact while your car is parked. This means that if somebody vandalizes your car or damages other property within view of the camera your dash cam will NOT record anything. It will only record if there is enough of an impact to your car to trigger the impact sensor.To make things even more confusing all of the cameras both the ones with Parking Mode and the ones with Parking Guard require a cable that Garmin has branded “Parking Mode Cable” to hardwire them to your car.I ended up returning the camera because of the lack of motion detection. If you’re wanting a camera that can record motion while parked then this isn’t the one.
4,this review relates to the combination of the camera and the associated app. if you put a micro sd card in and hold the button to reformat it will blink for hours never seeming to finish. if instead you use the app and tell it to reformat it seems to do ok. It kept failing to update the firmware until such time as I turned off the bluetooth headset I had paired with my phone then magically it updated. Still having trouble getting it to connect to my wifi I suspect I have to do the old trick of forcing my phone onto 2ghz wifi band but have not gone to that trouble yet. it tells me to re-enter the password but gives me no place to do that in the app. why do manufacturers still produce 2ghz devices and then try to feed them 5ghz channel numbers from their apps? just give the SSID and password over to it and let the device find the router in its limited band.my desired use for this cam is just to let it run while I am driving and only in some unusual situation do I plan to interact with it. simple always-on-while-driving then go get the footage later in some unlikely event.as for the post-setup part of this review I like the simplicity of touching one button to save some video where it won't get overwritten and the mic on/off button extends the simplicity. no screen to fuss with and distract you.  The normal cord was plenty long to cover the extra distance needed for my cargo van.the width of coverage looks good so far but the curvature of the images takes some getting used to. I'm not sure I want to talk to my camera but time will tell.
5,I got this dash cam for my 2018 Ford Edge Sport as traditional larger dash camera were too big with the housing around the mirror. This camera is nice and small allowing me to put it in the top corner of the passenger side of the windshield where it is out of your vision. Setup was very easy and the quality seems to be great both in the construction of the camera and in the image clarity.
5,I was going to get the 67W for the wide view but I decided I didn't want the distortion so got the 57.  This works perfect in a suburban and gives me window pillar to pillar coverage.
5,The product itself works wonderfully and was easy to use once I abandoned the app. After initially connecting inside my house and getting all the settings right I could never get it to connect to my phone outside of my house not even in the garage. It would just load and load forever. The way I found around this was to buy a SD card reader to use with my iPhone so I don’t need to look at videos on the app anymore. It just plugs in my phone select the vids you want to import and look at them that way. So other than connectivity issues with the app it’s been great. 👍🏼👍🏼
3,Picked this up to replace another camera that would constantly reset the clock making videos impossible to find. The Garmin camera is compact and seems to store video ok but the app is absolutely awful. Incredibly slow and constantly loses connection to the camera. I was hit the other day and it took multiple hours to finally get the video exported. No chance it would stream to my phone.
5,Had a little trouble with the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone. After troubleshooting with support it turned out my phone had a VPN from Norton virus app turned on that prevented the connection. Once that was disabled it was a breeze. I Highly rate this dash cam!
4,Decent value.  Decent night vision.  Slow to connect to wifi and Bluetooth on phone and hard to tell whether or not the red light on the side is muted or sound enabled 9 on recordings.  But decent so far even in 107f heat wave in Atlanta lately.
4,It's a great small dash cam easy to install if you are mechanically inclined. I've had this for a little over a month now and I noticed that it has it's quirks to it. Sometimes it freezes the light would stay solid red even when I unplugged the power from it. Letting it power down by unplugging it till the light goes off and plugging it back in will reset the device. Works perfect right that is done and also one day it just wouldn't turn on no light indication. Tried the unplugging method didn't work. Unslotted the memory card and put it back in came back to life. Might have to deal with what I went through at least once a month that's no biggie. All in all it's a great product which is why I gave it four stars.
3,I am a professional photographer with 40 years experience doing technical photography. I have discovered after owning several dashcams that one of the primary factors in video quality is how close to the windshield the dashcam lens is.  Ideally the dashcam lens would be within 1/4 inch or 6mm.  The Garmin mount places the camera about 1.5 inches 40mm from the windshield which results in a lot of unnecessary reflections and car parts in the field of view.
5,though it is just a small camera but with huge  result on quality night and day!
3,My long time friend a Garmin nuviCam LMTHD gps/dashcam decided to stop working after 6 faithful years of service. I was disappointed to learn that Garmin no longer makes a combination gps navigator/dashcam. I would have to buy both separately. I opted to get the 67W as it seemed to have all of the bells and whistles.Upon opening the box and trying to connect the 67W to my MacBook Air using a USB dongle (Apple has recently opted NOT to include USB ports on many of their laptops so you have to use a USB dongle) I found that the Garmin Express app would not locate it. I wanted to check that the firmware was up to date and ensure that I would be able to download any saved footage I may need in the future without issue.After several attempts to connect the 67W to my MacBook I gave up and contacted Garmin support. I explained the issue and the associate said this was a known issue with the new MacBooks that do not have a dedicated USB port. A dongle attached to the USB-C port is not supported. He suggested I simply use the Gamin Vault and download any footage I wanted via the cloud. He did say that I would be stuck with the existing firmware however.I opted to purchase the Garmin Mini 2 Dash Cam and have found that I can connect to the Garmin Express and Garmin Drive using the dongle and/or wifi and can update and download footage without an issue. Let's hope that Garmin fixes this software glitch in the future.
2,Video quality isn't great but it is tiny and with the Garmin name you should be able to expect it to last.  However it fairly often (1/5 or more) does not want to start.  It is not related to heat as it happens both in the heat when parked outside and also on cool days or even when in the underground (and always cold) parking garage where I live.The Garmin support suggest using only their cords using only their power supply (which is sold separately and has to be kept on your OBD port) and also to try swapping between the cords they provide in case only the long one works.  I also tried carrying a battery charger with the same connector so I could test if the power supply was the issue but regardless of which I was using (wired into battery power point or their OBD connector) the battery charger booted up every time but then plug the cam back in and nada.  I kept trying things (bc I like that it is small and hoped once I found the fix it would work long term) but I don't drive every day so it took a week or so to try each test before it would die again.  Without realizing it return window ended.  That's my bad - I should have kept track and just returned it.I've seen complaints about them not turning on and the fact that their own support says to keep swapping power supplies and cords infers that it is a known issue to them.  Hopefully they are good about warranties - I've had a few Garmin products (including their pricey BMW moto nav system) and have never had an issue with one before.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 cough a guy running a relight the fast few weeks of owning the Mini 2Easy to set uponly needs your phone and the app ONCE.use Live View to get the camera angle just rightyou can just delete the app after that and use it as is.NO GPS (speed can be used against you in court)sound can be turned off if needed.can get setup without a phone if you hate phonesI used the  Lens Cover: 010-12530-18 to reduce flairs
5,Easy to install and works as advertised.  Just wish they had better documentation and it save travelapse recordings to the cloud.
5,I tried another camera with high reviews before this Garmin but it had many issues and the app was worthless. The Garmin works right out of the box. I didn't even have to format the included SD card. This camera and app is perfect. Well worth the money.
4,Love this little gem only thing that doesn't work always is voice recognition but not a big deal anytime I brake hard it reacts.
5,Mounts easy. Easy to set up. Easy to get the video out of it. Takes up a tiny amount of windshield. Uncluttered by optional extras.
4,Camera is small and easy to install with a great video capability and quality. However the Bluetooth connection to my phone is flaky sometimes not connecting and sometimes freezing when switching apps on phone. Better software would make this small and powerful camera 5 stars.
3,Just wanted to have a simple dash cam that worked. Installed onto windscreen formatted flashcard then wanted to make sure cam was aligned okay so I had to of course pair with a smart phone for that. Wouldn't pair with my new Android I just bought this year. Had to dig up an old Samsung S7 -- that paired but now I have to have internet access on the phone to sign up for an account -- such an unnecessary hassle. Did that tried live feed didn't work tried it again worked and aligned the camera before the connection gave out. Shouldn't be that much of a hassle. Not everyone keeps their old phones kicking around as a backup for devices like Garmin that might not connect to newer ones.
3,There is nothing special about this dash cam the only thing to say is that it is small and unnoticeable. It works well in day time with good light and it is “plug and play” so set up is as easy as plugging into a USB A slot. Picture quality is fine. You won’t be able to catch a license plate with anything but sun tbh and night time? Forget about it lol. I will likely upgrade in the future but this is just for somewhat peace of mind. Yes dash cams can and are be expensive but I think it’s worth it after seeing it first hand.
4,5 months stops working completely- Garmin flash on screen over and over cannot reset cannot fix - customer support refuses to engage and work with me.-Updated August 2022 -Finally spoke to support returned and replaced so far so good!
3,The collision avoidance is annoying. Oncoming vehicles on a curve set it off. Event sensitivity is too sensitive. The app to access saved videos requires a password the WiFi has trouble connecting to my iPhone. Just way to finicky for  me !  Voice activation is about the only thing going for it.The VIOFO A129 pro is easier to set upWiFi connects quickly and easily and more available settings on the camera.  Don’t waste your money on this turd !
4,I needed and upgrade from a cheap Vava I had used for a couple of years which just wasn't reliable. I had several close calls which weren't captured. Bought this for it's small size and it works as advertised. The app is a bit wonky with connections and I had to tweak it (on Android) such that it wasn't always on and draining the phone battery. Picture quality is good. I installed it in front of the rear view mirror so it's almost invisible  to the driver and passenger. The led indicator and notification beep verify that the camera is one and good every time you start the car.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've been putting off getting a dash cam for years but I finally committed. The Garmin Mini 2 is a fantastic starter cam. Sure the video quality leaves a little to be desired in terms of sharpness but unless you want to get into the higher end models then most cameras at this price range are not going to be sharp enough for you to read the license plate on the vehicles around you.Highly recommend for anyone looking to finally commit to getting a dash cam. You can always upgrade down the line.
4,Tough to connect to but still the best choice in screenless dash cams.
3,I like the camera.  It was easy to set up.  Upon opening the box it was missing one of the two cables and the SD card was not there.  Yes it was supposed to come with it.
3,This is a good dashcam that connected with Garmin Drive app without any issue. I connected Garmin Dash Cam 47 with Garmin Constant Power Cable for always on power and Home wifi.What I like:1. Comes with memory card ready to use2. Longer power cable3. Decent quality camera4. Easy to pair with phone using Drive app.5. Once paired all settings can be managed using Drive appWhat I do not like:1. Device wifi do not connect with public wifi hotspots (eg: xfinity hotspots airport wifi hotel wifi) where we need to login using a browser. Even the cheapest travel routers support this feature but somehow Garmin missed it. So essentially we can connect the dashcam only to home wifi or mobile hotspot. Once the device is connected to wifi we can use the Live View and Vault features in Drive app. We really need these features when the car is away from the safety of our home but that is nearly impossible since it do not support public wifi.2. When the dashcam is connected to wifi we can use Live View and Vault features in Drive app. But we can not use 'Photos & Videos' feature to review the recordings within the device.3. Garmin Drive app supports 'Photos & Videos' feature to review the recordings only when phone is connected with the dashcam using Bluetooth. That is possible only when you are inside or near the car. Also dashcam disconnects bluetooth after a few minutes once you park your car even when dashcam is connected to always on power. So basically you can review the recordings using Drive app only when you are inside the car. Once you are inside the car anyway you can review directly in the dashcam screen which is faster than using Drive app.4. I verified all these with Garmin support but it was difficult in dealing with them.
4,Pros: This camera is small. It’s about the same size as my vw key fob and is practically invisible.Cons: It only records in 30 seconds intervals. The picture is not always clear enough to get a license plate # unless you are very close especially at night.Overall it’s a good dash cam if you just want to set it up and never have to worry about it until an accident.
5,I wanted to get a dash cam for my newer vehicle for peace of mind. I have purchased and installed other cameras in the past. This camera and the app are by far the easiest I have ever used. Installed the app on my phone and away I went. I like being able to log into the camera and verify the a and run videos back. In a perfect world I will never need the video.
4,Only works in a non smart port.
4,Pros: discreet compact wifi capabilityCons: not user friendly for multi camera setup.**Don't update the Dash Cam Mini 2.0 stay at version 2.90This Dash Cam Mini was working flawlessly for the past 3 days til I decided to run the software update.I enjoyed the voice command ability to take hands-free take snap shots of photos or video while driving.Updating to the latest version 3.0 renders this function inactive. The mini 2.0 no longer responds to voice commands regardless of Garmin drive app settingsCurrently unable to restore version 2.90 still back and forth with Garmin product support. The only solution was product replacement
5,Still trying to figure it out but it's working.
5,Installed the Garmin Dash Cam mini 6 months ago.  It was easy to install and set up.  The video picture quality is excellent.  When I start the car the camera turns on and records the trip - no need to connect your cell phone unless you want to see the video.  If there is an event it is easy to save the video permanently.  Also the mini is small and fits behind the rearview mirror - so it is inconspicuous to passengers and other vehicles.
5,I have 3 and will buy more. They work great. I've tried multiple different ones this is so far the best. Easy to use
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've had multiple dash cams in the past in both my commercial and personal vehicles and although all of them would record good quality videos downloading was counterintuitive and time consuming.  The Garmin Drive app and the  'Vault' cloud storage makes it really simple.  Just be sure to download your saved video/photos within 24 hrs unless you pay extra for longer storage.  IMO 24hrs is plenty YMMV.
5,wow this thing is small had it a month or so now works as expected looks better than expected. very happy with my purchase
4,Not able to read license plates well. Works well besides that. Easy to set up and use.
5,Excellent product mini size and great value for money!!
5,Works nice. My second Garmin Cameron.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought this dash cam (because apparently they’re just giving licenses out now days am I right?) anyway because garmin is a brand I know and decently trust. For the money I was NOT disappointed I’m actually very  impressed with all the features. Automatically records a bunch of stuff (which is nice) I’m not seeing ANY overheating or malfunctions or anything that any of these other reviews mention. I also find the app to be quite intuitive and is working great! They must’ve added nice updates because it’s working flawless for me! Discreet camera very easy to install and put a card into also very easy to download saved pictures and videos onto your phone and computer not sure what those complaints are about either. Very nice camera even at night will be buying more of these!! What came in the box is also more than I expected you’ll have a hard time making out license plates with this camera but other than that would recommend 100%
5,This is a perfect sized dash cam with all the features you need and none of the ones you don't need. Very simple to set up and install.I see a lot of bad reviews regarding the app but I haven't had any of these issues on my Android. I was able to pair the dashcam to my phone format the memory card and update the firmware within a matter of 5 minutes no problem.That said bluetooth is a poor choice of methods to view video and that's not specific to this device or Garmin. If you want to watch the videos simply take out the memory card and put it in your phone or laptop to view the videos. The bluetooth paring is really only useful for changing settings on the Garmin or updating the firmware.
5,Highly recommended!
5,I like how small it is. Only drawback is no screen but for me it’s not an issue. I just pop the memory card out (you have to buy separately) and review it on the computer. Keep what I want and delete the rest.
5,So my opinion it’s small enough to hide behind mirror and records any incidents that it may detect with the car. And has audio option and you can talk to it to start recording or turn on and off audio recording. But I personally want to know if the Garmin drive storage monthly thing is a good idea? Like is it worth it for the subscription?
5,I was looking for a camera with a parking mode feature in response to a recent raft of thefts of catalytic converters and air bags. I ordered and compared three models: VanTrue N1 VanTrue N4 and Garmin Mini2. The N1 won out--it's the least expensive and in my overnight tests actually turned on faster than the N4 when there was visible motion such as a person or auto came into view. The N1 also has a battery though I haven't figured out how long it will work. The N4 is overkill for my purpose--I don't need cameras inside the car or looking behind--though the N4 offers a higher resolution if I was to use only the front facing camera. One issue with both VanTrue models: the font in the diagram in the User Manual is so small as to require a magnifying glass! The Garmin detects movement in the vehicle but doesn't detect visible motion. At 1080 resolution isn't that good and I'm interested in a higher resolution camera in the future.
3,The camera initial feel is exactly what you would expect from Garmin; premium build quality. The menus are simple and easy to understand and the video had sufficiently quality for my needs.My only issue with it (and the reason I’m returning it) is that it will overheat sitting in FL sun. The camera will reboot itself in extreme situations but generally it will cycle on and off several times each time I jump in my vehicle and fire it up.Apparently Garmin has had these issues in the past from my research. Unfortunately I had to experience it myself.If you don’t live in places where the summer heat is above 90 I recommend it.
5,Works great and has been doing well in the heat currently in Florida and it’s been 90-100 degrees so you can imagine the temp inside the vehicle. The apps been working just fine the feature of deleting older footage when storage is  full is awesome the parking mode is good once you turn up the sensitivity audio recording is good video is what you expect good quality for a camera the size of your thumb. The activation sounds don’t bother me I prefer to know that the thing is on and recording without having to put my hands on it every-time I get in and out of my vehicle.
4,Nice small package. Decent images at day and night. Enough to catch plates and general car description if needed. It auto saves during hard braking and the app is really easy to use. I forget it’s there half the time because it’s so nice and compact. Lil red light let’s you know it’s still watching.
3,Camera itself is pretty good but it won’t continuously record. When I was driving at night pallet came flying over and knocked out my driver side mirror it’s pretty scary I immediately pulled over and tried to find clip it wasn’t recorded. It wasn’t there
5,This was the 2nd dash cam I tried.  The first one needed to be connected to my phone all the time which I didn’t want as I have apple car play on my radio.  This one however works much better.  I installed it and don’t need to do anything for it to work.  If I need to review something I connect to it export the video if needed and then disconnect.  The cord was long enough to route around the windshield under the dash under my center console to plug into the console power port so the wire is totally hidden.  I may be purchasing a couple more of these.
4,This would not connect! So frustrating and hours later after sitting in my car with it on for hours I tried turning my mobile Norton 360 off and that allowed it to connect! I still am trying to figure out how to save a video from the vault.
4,I picked a Garmin Dash Cam because I have been happy with previous Garmin products and the support that Garmin provided.  The Garmin 47 Dash Cam is small compact and easy to install with the permanent magnetic mount.  I used a Samsung PRO Endurance 128GB micro-SD card that worked without issues.  I was able to sync it with the iOS Garmin Drive app and all the functions worked.  The Garmin 47 is a good dash cam and works as described.  But…If the ability to decipher numbers and text on most license plates and other signs is important then the 1080p video resolution is not adequate.  For my next Dash Cam i would opt for a higher resolution Dash Cam such as the Garmin 57.I found that the one-minute interval for a Travelapse Video is too long and not very useful.  An option for a 15 or 30 second interval should be provided.
4,I want to give this a 5 star but the fact I can not use hotspot to see live or access vault is its only fault. Easy set up Pic quality is good and love the voice commands. I do recommend.
3,The Garmin Dash Cam 67W falls short in my book for a few reasons. One the "dash cam" doesnt work as well on your dashboard as your windshield which is puzzling because after all its called a "dash cam." The position of the base to the camera is more suited for use on your windshield than your dashboard. (My state law doesnt allow use of windshield mounted cameras) When you set it on your dashboard the angle of the camera can never be truly adjusted to an ideal position due to its immobility. Secondly when the camera is mounted on the dashboard all the alerts that come up on the camera screen are inverted. Lastly on sunny days the camera screen is not visible. These are the reasons the Garmin Dash Cam 67W gets a 3 star rating from me.
3,Everything else works aside from live view.  Love view will only work if you have mobile data and wifi turned completely off and you aren't auto connecting to home wifi. Even then it seldom works
5,This dashcam works great. And searching YouTube you'll find everything you'll need to know on how to set it up and to use it.
5,Withstands Arizona temperatures.No other has lasted more than 3 months.Great connection to the phone.Good picture quality.So far it does better than the previous dozen other brands.
4,It does the job for such a small device. It works great as it is easily concealable right by the rear view mirror
4,It is a nice small dash camera which is easy to install and operate. Overall it produces good quality picture but due to a relatively low resolution on many occasions it is difficult to read plate numbers of the cars in front of you especially at night. Usually if the car is perfectly positioned in front and center of the dash cam one can read the plate numbers relatively easy however if the car is a little off the center from the camera plates become much harder to read. At night plates are unreadable almost all the time. So if you want to have a camera to record a hit-and-run accidents look for a camera with a higher resolution. Otherwise for most other cases it will do the job.
4,Upon receiving this camera I was impressed with its build quality.  It does require a U3 V30 rated SD card or I received slow memory card warnings and only 5-8 minutes of video from a 20+ minute drive.  I expected better video quality at this price point.I did not receive a SC card with my camera.
5,Update: Started off good but after a few months it started leaving gaps between the video. Sometimes just a few minutes sometimes up to half an hours Contacted tech support to be told I didn’t know what I was talking about and they won’t fix it despite providing pictures of the gaps. I will be selling this and buying a different brand. Very disappointed in Garmin.
4,It’s better than any cheap cam out there. They videos are nice but not the best. You can not read license plates numbers at 2 cars distance. If you need to see a license plate you need to stay right behind the vehicle you want to record. Other than that bigger signs are readable. Night vision is decent. Not the best but it works. Easy to move from car to truck and i use a magnetic charger for it to make it even easier to unplug and plug back in. It helps me to do some paper work while im in line at the port yards waiting for hours to get a load. It makes a loud noise when the truck in front of me moves.
5,Only one small gripe: The Mini 2 came with only the low profile mount that sticks directly to the car window.  My DC 46 came with a low profile mount that holds by magnet to a small octagonal metal disk that sticks to the window.  Much easier to remove the magnetic mount when bringing the Mini 2 in to update its software.
5,I put a dash cam in every vehicle I own. This Garmin Mini 2 is easily the cleanest hard wire install i've ever done when combined with a Dongar technologies mirror USB power adapter which you can get for most vehicles that have an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The whole install took well under 5 minutes is super clean and discreet and completely removable with zero permanent alteration or damage. You can also get a mini suction cup mount if you plan to move it between vehicles or take it down often (purchased separately).The Garmin app works pretty well and is simple to use. Connections worked well no complaints there. A subscription is offered for cloud storage but you don't need it. I have not tried many of the "advanced" features. Picture quality is reasonably good but i've had several dash cams which are better. However the Garmin Mini 2 is absolutely tiny compared to everything else i've used and everything works well and works reliably.
5,Garmin is the best brand and I’m using their products more than a decade. I Never get wrong with garmin! You will also…
2,The Short:Video quality is very good for the price point but it has numerous issues with the software and device itself. I've used other higher cost brands before and never had the sort of challenges I did with this one. I buy these devices to help with liability issues where I live and I can't keep using one with so many difficulties.I may just have a bad one but while searching for the problems I have: I am not the only one with these experiences.The Long:Likes:Paired with the polarizing lens the pictures are clear without hurting the night vision too much.The small size makes it very discreteProblems:Doesn't keep time. Garmin help recommends you connect it to the app to update but it loses it immediately. Not feasible or desirable to have to reconnect it manually every time I get inRandomly restarts while driving or sticks in parking mode causing it to beep constantly as it records everything as a parking incident.Can't view or transfer videos in the software error every time. Have to remove the sim card and move it to a PC.
5,I've had this a few months are really like it.  Camera/video quality is excellent day and night.  My car has as all the safety stuff up around the rear-view mirror so I wanted something small that would not block it or my view or be obvious. It would be nice if I could mount it horizontally instead of vertical but it's not bad. I bought the polarizer lense but it doesn't seem to make much of a difference no matter which way you turn it.  Connecting to the phone app is a little slow.  I would purchase it again if needed.
5,For the price this is a good basic dash cam for those who do not want anything fancy. The picture is OK at HD quality. Setup and installation was easy. Their app is awesome - very reliable and easy to use. I do wish I could change the time interval from one minute to something longer but it's rare I need to pull any video so it's not that big a deal.
5,This thing is a life saver. I know too many people who have gotten partial fault for accidents because they didn't have any proof to show the other parties culpability. With this item you don't have to worry about it anymore. Accidents happen and it's a lot easier for your insurance/attorneys to prove your side of a story with evidence. Should you unfortunately end up in an accident this little item will likely pay for itself multitudes over.Lots of wiring to run behind panels and a bit of a pain for anyone without the proper tools. Installation took me about 40 minutes in total.I like this product so much I will be buying a second camera to install in the rear of my vehicle for another angle of safety/protection.
4,I used to have the earlier Garmin dash cam and was used to the screen size.  This screen is smaller and not as viewable.  I still haven't tried to take the dash cam off of the articulating ball socket so I don't know if you can or not.  There is nothing in the instructions that tell you if you can or not.  I have not tried to hook it up to my computer so I can't say if that works well or not.
4,GARMIN 57 has very good camera quality and is very easy to install and mount. The dash camera came with everything needed to install within about 10-12 minutes everything from formatting the memory card and adjustment of camera settings is very straightforward. You will need to download the GARMIN app to use functions like GPS and WI FI. glad I made this purchase it gives you added peace of mind when driving or when your away from your vehicle.My overall rating of 4 stars is because I think Garmin should provide a better in box user manual instead of the large safety booklet which should have been made available  online or as a PDF download on the GARMIN website.
3,Does not connect to wifi
5,This thing is amazing.Simple to use great quality and picture.Some people complain about having it and a phone in use at the same time.The limitation is in your phone not the camera!This thing is amazing and easy to use. I did add a 128GB card to replace the one that came with it.However that was a personal choice not necessary to operate it and use it.I love the images it takes.
4,Compact camera. Takes a bit to learn as the instructions are minimal. Phone interface could be better. Good picture quality.
5,Lots of dash cams out there to choose from. I went with Garmin for the quality of products and long track record with tech. Tried Nexar first but they’ve got a lot to work out. This camera is small easy to install and does what I need it to. Has many features although many you may shut off. I just want it for protection just in case. Voice activation is great because then you can hide the camera behind the mirror and not have to worry about pressing the button if you want to record or take a picture.
4,The sticker mount seems very secure perhaps better than suction as my suction camera falls from window on hot days.  Video quality isn't good enough to read a license plate but it is otherwise very good.  The wifi connection is very clunky I couldn't get it to work at all and I am very tech savvy.  It is easier to remove camera from car and plug into a PC with USB cable to see video clips.  Not worth the price.
1,What can I say poor camera poor app poor instructions. The only good thing I have to say about it is it's consistently awful in every aspect. They were very thorough in making sure this product is bad in every possible way. Took multiple times to get it to connect. After about a half an hour of shutting down and restarting the camera Bluetooth and the app I finally got a connection YES! Only to be assaulted with log into to the Vault ads  Garmin's subscription service to store the crappy quality videos on. Only I don't want to do this I just want want to check out the camera. So I go own with out it and try to figure out how to use the app. Nothing helpful in there. just take a picture see live video or save a video. So I check out see live video and see a really poor quality video feed of my driveway. Okay how about I save the video. Click video has been saved! Okay now let's check out the video. Go to saved videos nothing meanwhile the vast bulk of your screen is taken up by a huge ad for the Vault that you have to click off every time you move around the app. I leave the app for a few minutes come back and guess what. Now I have to go through the whole torture of pairing my phone and camera again. Just what I want to do every time I start my car spend 30 minute trying to get my phone to pair with a crappy camera. Oh and guess what if you live in a cool climate you need to wait until it's warmer than 70 degrees outside to get the glue to stick to your windshield. So don't bother buying fall through spring. Actually don't bother buying at all.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It was easy to setup using the app. Very simple video quality is average 1080p I love the size of the dash cam. Connecting to the camera using WiFi was easy.Cons so far it records the video in big chunks and it takes too long to download using the app. It’s faster to remove the memory card from the camera and download to a computer.
5,It's really good quality and will help you know if you're approaching a red light camera or if traffic started moving again. On the downside it's constantly making noises and chirping at you and it's a bit distracting.
5,This camera is very easy to use and install. It is nice that this one is blue tooth and does not require a usb cable to retrieve video or use a stupid wifi link. This is the one you want if God forbid there is an accident and you need to easily send the video to the police or insurance company.
2,This dash cam is great. Good features with good picture quality that is easy to mount and setup. I purchased two of these one for a 2016 Ford Fusion and one for a 2021 Ford F150. The one for the Fusion works great! That being said if you use wireless Apple CarPlay like on my F150 you may not be able to have all of the functionality while your vehicle is on.I suspect the issue is that both wireless Apple CarPlay and the wireless connection utilize the 802.11n 2.4GHz on the same channel. Most wireless devices are smart enough to change channels in the 2.4GHz range if they sense another device using the same channel however Garmin nor most auto makers are tech companies.I reached out to Garmin support to let them know of the issue and to request a simple software patch where if it registers interference on one 2.4 channel it switches to another and was met with "unfortunately we are unable to change the band/channel to avoid this. You may need to disable the CarPlay for Live streaming." This is not an acceptable answer because the 2.4GHz band is license free and changing wireless channels within the band is baked into the WiFi 802.11n standard.The reason I rate the Garmin 67W poorly is not because of the actual camera but because of the software and mostly the support. The camera itself is very good but having support tell you you can't use most of the features while your vehicle is turned on is not an acceptable solution.At the present time I would NOT recommend this to anyone using a vehicle with an in vehicle hotspot or wireless Apple CarPlay. If you have a vehicle that is older couldn't recommend this dash cam more it works great.
4,Does as says nice quality pictures. Recommend.
5,I've had several dash cams before and this little guy is by far the best.  It's so small that it becomes invisible to the eye.  The voice controls are intuitive and easy to use. Need to save a clip of an incident just say "Ok Garmin save video".  The image quality is outstanding and with the correct software you can zoom in if necessary.  The nighttime video is also great.
5,The only problem is the location of the control buttons for me. If you put it up close to the mirror it is difficult to tap the buttons. Might be OK in Europe. Overall I'm well satisfied.
3,I have the 66W in my vehicle and it has served me well. I decided to buy the 67W for my wife's vehicle but then I realized that the 67W is the same exact camera with the added requirement to make a Garmin user profile to view any of the footage. What a crock. It simply amazes me that Garmin could take such a great camera and screw it all up with terrible firmware updates.
3,I'm writing this review with specific points on my experience vs comments other reviewers have made.quality - I'd rate it high.  I'd rather have a metal casing vs plastic but still I'd consider it physically high quality.menu - worked fine for me.app + compatibility - worked great with both my iPad && iPhoneresolution - this is my sole negative here I have to comment on.  And I wonder if its just me or something I'm doing wrong.  Resolution seems low and grainy.  I've tried both 720 and 1080 resolution settings.  resolution seems poor for what is being charged for this unit.  Let me know if there is some other setting or if I'm doing something wrong.  Software/firmware is updated to the latest version.Mounts up great in my IH Scout 800A.
5,The cam seems to be doing what its supposed to. Give lane departure and front collision  warnings. I haven't downloaded any video to see the quality of the recordings yet. Appears to have a good view range with 140 degree view
5,I have several Garmin products already and have had good luck with this company over the years.  I decided to add a dash cam to my car and read lots of reviews and comments and decided to go with the company that I have had great results from.  The 57 was easy to install in a Toyota Camry took about 5 minutes.  I am using one of the car's usb ports for now but have ordered the new Garmin Constant Power Cable which will plug into the OBDII port and provide constant power to the unit.  I added the SanDisk 256gb High Endurance Micro SD card and that took all of about 30 seconds to add and format.The first drive with the new unit was fine.  You can opt into the Garmin Vault which will store your videos for a number of days at a subscription of down the videos or pop out the card and download onto your computer.  The video is crisp and clean.  This unit is very small and the screen is mico sized but if you want a live view you can pair with the garmin drive app and view live view on your phone.  All in all I am pleased with the purchase and may update in a month or two after longer drives.
2,Dash cam came rapidly; either Garmin or this vendor did not provide the owners' manual - just a long caution package and a quick start guide which doesn't even mention many of the features shown in the advertising for this.  Eventually found that there is an owners' manual - on the web 30 pages long.  Either quality control in packaging is terrible or this vendor is recycling used items as new items.Magnetic mount is such a joke it comes in the package but isn't even mentioned in the owners' manual. Once you attach the unit to the windshield you can't take it down - have to bring a computer to the unit.
5,Finally decided to get a dashcam after my daughter was hit and the driver tells a totally different story to the police after he realizes the intersection cameras were not working.  This got great reviews and works as advertised.  It’s very unobtrusive almost invisible to other drivers and captures crystal clear images.
5,Love this camera because of its lack of video screen. Who really needs that nowadays? The app connects reliably albeit a little on the slow side. The red lights for audio/video remain steady while filming and are not distracting. Such a tiny camera about the size of my Ioniq 5 key fob. Video quality is decent but at times can be difficult to make out license plates.Knock on wood I don't run into any incidents. But if that were to happen probably best to read aloud any license plates. Hit the camera shutter button. Also may purchase a separate OTG usb card reader.
5,This dashcam is excellent. High quality video and audio as well as voice commands. The app works well I can pull videos off the camera straight to my phone through Wi-Fi so no need to remove the camera from the car. It is expensive but you are paying for the high quality that comes from Garmin products.
5,We bought this when we started driving in a city with terrible traffic. Thank gosh we did! My wife was in a complicated many-lane traffic circle when someone tried to turn into her and hit her (driver's side door). She was so shaken up she totally forgot we had a dash cam at all. Once she got home safe we remembered that we had it and we saw that our Garmin had automatically recorded the incident. What a great feature! The video didn't show the car hitting her (since it was pointed forward not at the driverside door) but it did show all of the traffic circle signage as the incident happened and the other car so it was clear that we were following the rules of the road and the other car didn't. Our insurance was able to use the video to quickly determine that we were not at fault. I am so glad that we had it and can't recommend it enough!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I rarely write reviews unless a product is terrible or amazing and unfortunately this product is absolutely appalling. Garmin is a trusted by airline pilots for their reliability and accuracy so I took this trust to mean that they would release a highly competent dashcam and bought three of these units.The problems start with the fact it is incredibly difficult to pair an iphone to the device - expect to waste 30-40 minutes going backwards and forwards with bluetooth and wifi settings before you can connect the phone.  Don't expect by-the-way once the device is paired it will stay paired or reliably connect to your iphone - it won't.  Expect to spend 30-40 minutes reconnecting devices every time you want to use the iphone app.  This is the least of the camera's problems.The worst part is the picture quality and specifically the ability to read license plates from video footage.  You can't.  Multiple times we've wanted to report an incident to the police only to find that the footage is so grainy it is impossible to read a license plate even for a car almost on your front bumper.  The videos look like VHS tape rendered onto YouTube from the 1980s.We bought these cameras to create a safe environment for our teenage kids and they are worse than useless.  I now question their competence or reliability in the sky if they are prepared to push such a poor quality product to unsuspecting consumers.In the attached footage watch the white truck zoom past on the right and go on to scrape the side of a Lexus SUV.  No chance of getting the license plate of any of the cars despite their immediate proximity.
3,I purchased this camera after seeing many samples of it's footage on DashCamOwnersAustralia's YouTube channel and the video quality is every bit as good as it looked on there.Really stellar picture quality and the audio quality is also surprisingly good (if that matters to you).  The supplied cable was a good length and the magnetic mount is a really elegant and clever design.However.  Your first priority after buying this camera should be to go into the settings menu and disable every single "driver assist" feature as well as the voice command.If you do not the camera will make annoying beeping and blooping noises every few minutes while in use whenever it "detects" something.  It will also false trigger the voice command from lyrics in music or casual conversation.
3,Nice and small very discreet.  Voice control to save pictures and videos is handy.  The software is a bit kludgy and it usually takes multiple attempts to get Live View to work (to aim the camera).  Nice wide angle lens good quality video.  EV is adjustable to compensate for tinted windows if you're using this as a rear camera.  Audio recording is selectable via side button or voice command.  A mini suction cup or some type of mirror mount would be great as this only has an adhesive mount.  Mine seems to get hot when running and apparently a lot of these do run hot.  We will see what that does for reliability - get the extended warranty if you can.
2,My biggest issue was I could not get the garmin drive app to work with my phone (Android Pixel 3a). In order to view recorded videos on your phone or use the live view tool you will NEED THE APP.Without it you will only be able to view your recorded videos by taking out the SD card and plugging it directly to your computer.It worked randomly one time (so I know my settings are right) but it usually hangs in the "connecting to feed" screen.Beautifully designed dash cam but horrible app experience.-------------------------Update 9/13/2021Finally got the app to work. Works wonderfully but just wanted to warn others about the parking mode.The "parking mode" that is advertised works by having the dash plugged into your fuse box so it can receive constant power. Once it has constant power you can set your dash to record while your vehicle is turned off for a set amount of time. For example you can continue to record for 10 20 or 30 minutes after you shut off your engine.Here is the issue. Lets say you leave your car unattended for 24 hours in a sketchy neighborhood. You set to record 24 hours after the car is turned off. By the time you get back to your car most of your previous footage stored is most likely already written over (with 24 hours of parked footage) since it continuously records due to a lack of motion detection or vibration feature. Why on earth would I want 24 hours of parked footage when other dash cameras can easily record only when motion is detected??? Horrible design on Garmins part.Also for anyone wondering about overheating IT DOES OVERHEAT under extreme conditions. I did a 7 hour roadtrip in 100 degree weather and received a warning that the dash camera is slowing down and it shut off by itself.
4,This device is great! Great picture quality voice control intuitive app and interface. There is only one thing that could be improved. If one manually records (i.e.- “OK Garmin save video.”) one can download it from the cloud on the app. However the camera continuously records in one minute chunks. If one wants to view the continuous feed one must read the SD card from their computer. That aside I’ve used other dash cams and this is my favorite.
3,I had this camera for about a month and while the picture quality is great the other features are certainly lacking. The build quality is very nice and the included windshield mount works very well. However the camera's voice features do not work very well or at least they didn't in my case. The camera would sometimes not respond to my voice commands at all. I updated the firmware and still no improvement. Sometimes the camera would randomly shut off and would not start when I started the engine. I checked the power cable to make sure it wasn't a connection issue and sure enough the cable was working just fine.
4,Seems to work fine. No fuss. Conects to my my BMW hotspot with no issues. Had to turn off alerts as they got annoying. Knocked 1 star off because the 12v plug doesn't work but since I have a free usb port it's not worth sending back over something I probably won't use anyways.
4,Compact unit with OK image
4,The dash cam is easy to install and provides a more “safe” feeling while driving on the roads. The night time quality is great. I upgraded from a Cobra dash cam which this Garmin is a much better camera. I just do not like the side positioned buttons it makes it difficult to adjust without accidentally pressing buttons.
5,I have had this for about 2 weeks know and I just got to say wow.I have bought many in the past but they all fell short and/or just did not work.The Garmin mini 2 just WORKS. Camera quality is great voice commands are great it stays in place unlike many others that fall off and you have to mess with it.The only con I have is that it did not come with a memory card.
5,Easy to use and install. Great camera.
5,So to start off I got the 67W because of how much I enjoyed the 66W. The downside was I couldn't get it to format a couple new micro SD card I got (because the 16gb that it comes with is a terrible choice). I tried a 128gb Samsung EVO and a 32gb Samsung EVO but neither was able to be formatted. I tried formatting them to FAT32 on a laptop first with no success and gave the camera 15 hours for the 128gb card before just cycling power to the camera. I got fed up and called Garmin tech support to see if they had any solutions and whether or not this was a common problem. Sadly they were not helpful. Eventually I put the original 16gb card back in because it worked with that. I was going to send it back to Amazon for a replacement. But I decided to see if there were any firmware updates and there were. I updated the camera and to my surprise it quickly formatted both the 32gb and 128gb cards.So try updating the camera first if you can't get it to format your new micro sd cards!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Bought 4 for family vehicles. Captured several reckless drivers and a very close call.Pros: Tiny. Easy to install. Voice control. Good app.Cons: Not 4K. Doesn’t include a memory card. Connectivity between app and camera can be finicky at times.
3,Instructions are not in the box.  You will have to go to the website for instructions.  Great picture and features.  However this is the lousiest software I have ever had the misfortune of using.  The thing is always rebooting or downloading software.  Saved videos/pictures are stored for only 24 hours if you want to store them longer than that you will have to pay a 4.99 per month fee for 7 day  storage time or 9.99 for 30 day storage time.  If I had known there were going to be additional fees for online storage I would not have ordered the thing in the first place.  So far the cons outweigh the pros.
2,So this camera. If the features all worked consistently it would be amazing. But they don't. I constantly get an error message stating the SD card is slowing down and needs to be reformatted. I've tried several cards all the type the manual says to use but it doesn't change. How a solid state memory device slows down is beyond me. And it's no good formatting the SD card because it will just start giving you the same error message like two minutes later. And then sometimes it just stops recording. Doesn't tell you doesn't alert you on your phone just stops. The led lights are SO BRIGHT that I've had to cover them up with tape so they don't blind me at night and since they're always flashing about something it doesn't help me to see when there's a problem or what the problem is. The app is very buggy too often you'll open it and it will say nothing is on the SD card but if you pull the SD card and put it in your computer there will be files on there. Altogether it could be really good. But it's not it's buggy and constantly throws error messages and is unreliable.
2,Initial review after unboxing…- Great size for least intrusive front or rear camera- hardware starts up and quick-start guide gets things going fast- software app installed from App Store but didn’t use the program name listed in quick-start guide- even after only a few hours use prior to install it seems app struggled to connect to devices. It would often take several attempts- did firmware update; took three download tries to get to latest- app is clunky ; I’d expect better from Garmen- only can get live video once out of every three attempts (drops connection and has to re-acquire); also “live” is about two seconds delayed- saving videos over WiFi is very tedious. One has to select the portion of a long video (drive session) to save a snippet of the whole. The selection  sliders are not accurate and sometimes don’t even move.- wow does this thing get HOT. After about 30 minutes at my computer desktop indoors with ~70F the thing was too hot to hold. I am just not sure how this will survive behind my windshield under typical summer sun load.I’ll add to this review after install and some drive testing. I won’t be able to test hot environment operations until summertime.Update: This camera can only be mounted at top of window glass. Cannot install at bottom nor rotate upside down. The mounting stalk restricts rotating to view the roadway when upside down.For SUVs one may have to install camera in the middle of the window to get a clear view where the wiper is clear.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This dash cam just delivered yesterday and I installed it as soon as it came in. This morning on my way to work I hit a deer and it captured it in great quality even though it was dark. The timing of this was honestly insane lol
5,I didn’t want to spend a ton of cash on a dash cam.  This one seemed to be a good buy.  I’ve been using it for about a month now and I feel like I made a good decision.  The picture is pretty good even at night.  I like the hands free operation.  The lane departure collision alert and traffic moving notification is what made this the best buy for me.  I don’t have these features on my truck.  It isn’t bulletproof but it works most of the time.
5,Nothing I can say that hasn't been stated in other reviews. This dashcam worked perfectly for me pretty much nothing I would change to make it better for the price 5 stars.
2,The software is difficult to use. I wanted to save a clip to my phone and couldn't do it. The share button in the app wasn't working so I was unable to download. So I took out the SD card and tried to manually extract the footage. Somehow it lapsed exactly over the time spot that I needed to capture!
1,My wife's car was damaged by a hit-skip in her parking garage so we purchased a Garmin 67W for the front window and a Garmin 47 for the rear window.  I also purchased Garmin's Constant Power Cable (010-12530-23) and  the Extra-Long Power Cable (010-12530-07) because of the so-called "Parking Guard" feature.  I had everything professionally installed by a trusted mechanic so we didn't have wires dangling everywhere.  I added a 512 SD card to the 67w and a 256 SD card for the rear 47 camera and set it up with Garmin's less than user friendly "Drive" app.  Everything worked fine for approximately three weeks until the 67W began to frequently freeze with the message "Starting Parking Guard".  The message stays frozen forever regardless of the car moving or being parked.  None of the buttons worked and the ONLY way to reset was to remove the power cable for about 20 minutes.  After 5 or 6 events I called Garmin's Customer Service.  The gentleman was polite but after a long series of questions he promised to send a replacement dash cam.  As it turns out here's their process:  "Now you can ship your device back to Garmin by using the return shipping label provided in your confirmation email. We’ll let you know when we get your device. Then we’ll process it and ship your replacement."  How long will it take before I receive a replacement?  It's positively absurd that Garmin doesn't immediate ship a brand new camera!  I'll certainly update my rating once everything is finalized but I'd strongly recommend avoiding Garmin's dash cameras.Update 3-13-22:  Garmin did send a replacement within 10 business days.  Unfortunately we have the exact same problem with STUCK ON PARKING GUARD.  To make matters worse even the rear 47 camera is frozen with a message about the SD card slowing down and should be formatted.  I just spent about 45 minutes completely resetting them.  For the moment I'm back to square one but have no expectation these won't be freezing again in 2- 3 weeks.  Its too late for me to get a refund so the only thing I can advise you to do is AVOID Garmin's dashcams.  Maybe someday they'll figure it out but your better off with a $50 dashcam that actually works.
1,I've owned this camera for about three months--I bought it because it was tiny.I've gone through 3 dash cams and this is unacceptably unreliable.Every aspect of the product is horrendous especially the hardware but also the software.I've never seen anything like this before.The hardware aspects: It fails to turn on almost all the time when I turn the car on. It locks up randomly and doesn't recover unless it is completely drained of power. The status LED sometimes shows a pattern not even shown in the manual while locked up.Even if it supposedly works correctly the parking mode/incident detection never works. It is advertised to start recording if the car gets bumped but I've shaken the car pretty violently and even flicked the camera and it doesn't record the carnage. The documentation regarding unattended operation is also horrendous and confusing; I'm not even sure if I'm using it correctly at this point.Software wise I've had multiple instances where it refuses to connect to Bluetooth. It required a hard reset of both the app and the device itself to get it working again.Do not buy this product! As a consumer electronics product electrical engineer myself I am appalled at the horrendous UX of this product. Our company's products would never ever ship in this state.
3,I tried to follow the instructions from the box for formatting the micro SD card.  The instructions just show three pictures without any text indicating that LEDs are green when formatting and red when finished.  However while attempting to follow these instructions I found the two LEDs alternately flashing blue or yellow.  Nothing is mentioned anywhere on what this means.  I finally gave up trying to format the card with the unit and formatted the card on my PC.
3,The camera is great (do recommend to get the polarizing filter).  But in my experience using the device and phone app in the real world is challenging.  To be able to upload videos you have to have your phone close enough to the camera to not lose Blu tooth connection with it and at the same time have a good wi-fi connection to your phone.  That's not easy to do when traveling.The app acts wonky at times. And apparently has been updated from any available instruction guides.  Maybe people more tech savvy than me know how to work around the challenges I've had.
5,I use it every day. Doesn't block my view. Very cute compact size.
4,Park mode only works with special cable. Works on battery but only records a few seconds after an impact. If someone backed into you camera probably wouldn't start until after they were gone. Supposed to work better with special cable but my Corolla doesn't have any free fuse spots for install so you'd have to tap wires voiding car warranty. Good dash cam for driving though. Super clear wide view.
3,Didn’t realize it need to pay monthly subscription for cloud storage to see your videos
4,Using the app was the most frustrating part as it took me about 30mins to set it up with my “spotty” wifi. My iPhone 12 lost its Bluetooth pairing after pairing my phone with the dash cam app so that made this set up even more frustrating.
5,Well I have bought tons of dash cams and I must say this garmin is it for Voice activated great quality highly recommended
5,I’m glad I bought this brand since it’s a well known company that I can trust so far haven’t any issues.  The only thing is I wish that there was suction cup that goes with camera.
2,So this camera has great reviews looks great small and with great options. Well I was wrong. The first camera I got didn't work so I returned it (Amazon you were awesome with this process). Second camera I got working after rebooting it my phone a 1/2 a dozen times I finally got to connect to it. I think went and set it up in the Bronco and I haven't been able to connect to it again on Bluetooth. I got stuck wait for a train for 15 mins and in that time with multiple reboots of the camera my phone the app nothing worked. So I tired again spent 30 mins troubleshooting this with the website and the tools on the app no connection. I'm wondering if you have to sign up for the paid cloud storage for Bluetooth to be useable.  I'm seriously considering returning this and going with another camera.
5,The best for the money
3,Needs longer power cord and different angle for mounting on front windshield cord only made it the side Pilar sux to say after spending a pretty penny I must spend for longer cord fml
4,Not a bad little dashcam! It relies on the Garmin phone app though but you can download the videos directly on to your computer. Also has voice commands!
5,I really like this camera and the fact it works with the same app as my gpa so I don’t have to use multiple apps. Video quality is good and I haven’t had any issues. If I had to complain about anything it would be that it does take little bit of time for the camera to delete videos. It isn’t instant. But not a big deal since it loop records over the older videos.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought this for peace of mind. It tucks neatly behind my rear view mirror out of view. Setup was easy. My video is of a close call but today somebody backed into me and claimed I was at fault. The video clearly shows the scene and has absolved me of liability. It's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
5,Pros: Easy to install doesn't block your view due to small size simple setup and user interface.Cons: The app is ok can sometimes crash or have trouble connecting but overall very usable.
2,I love the size of the camera and the quality of the recordings.  It is also nice to turn on/off the audio recording.  I installed in the fall and had no problems until summer where I find that on hot days I have to turn on the A/C and put it through the window defroster setting otherwise it will beep and turn off.  When it does that I crank the A/C on defrost and the camera comes back on 10-15 mins later.You may think that I live in the desert but nope...I'm in Michigan.  If there is an overheating problem in Michigan I would hesitate recommending this camera anywhere below Canada...
5,I upgraded from the 66w I love the exterior and interior recording. The low light capability is very good my only complaint is the app is a little finicky at times. I would order this one again!
5,Compact and very easy to install. You can’t really go wrong with this dashcam. It gets pretty hot but it’s a 1080p camera packed into a small box also the app is kind of slow and seems outdated other than that this thing is good so far.
3,I'd just look elsewhere.The physical unit felt like some cheap plastic toy almost flimsy definitely not a good physically sturdy dashcam.Also this dashcam (have now returned 2 defective) would at times not turn on/off. Wouldn't activate parking mode at times. And as time went on the thing started to restart itself multiple times before it would even work like 7 times in a row.It would also warn me about a front collision when there wasn't a car in sight.
3,I found two biggest nightmares with the 67w dashcam: 1. The app on iPhone does not work properly. I had to try several times to pair both devices without success. No matter if you have the latest iOS the iphone did not find the dash cam as an accessory . Also when they paired and I wanted to change the camera settings the app closed it by itself. Poor app development. The app is part of the dash cam experience and it is frustrating that you cannot enjoy the camera due to a mediocre app design. 2. Each time read again each time that the camera turns on I need to set up the country on the dashcam. I don’t  understand why.I bought this dash cam having in mind that Garmin should have good design on everything but I was wrong.
5,App glitches have been fixed option to turn off beeping alert on camera very clear 1080p with the polarized lens that’s a must add on. This thing is on point!
5,Excellent dash cam. Good quality video and audio. Days of storage on a 128 card. The download to the app is very very slow. If you need the images just pull the card and load them into a pc or tablet. The parking lot monitor is not worth the additional work to install or the cost of the adapter and wiring kit. Needs the polarizing lens. Unobtrusive on the windshield.  Good camera for the price. Very happy with it.
5,The picture quality is great. Ease-of-use is the best. The features are great. I love the voice activation options. And the one underrated feature that I use all the time is the travel lapse! Just a grade A dash cam.
5,I will be putting up pics soon^Amazing picture quality and I run 35% tint on my entire windshield!It's super easy to set up and hook up to bluetooth!The wire is super simple to hid and it's so small it's impossible for anyone to see it!!!
5,Picture and video quality are good. Not the best. Using on my VW Id.4. It’s small and fits anywhere. Love that you can tell it to save a file.
5,Was a lil thrown off with the price but it had some neat features I was interested in like the voice activation and traffic warning. So far this has been a great cam and was super easy to setup. In addition  to the app and the quick connectivity via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth I see having this for a very long time. Would recommend!
3,Small and compact easy to install and mount just wish video quality was any good.  Can’t read license plates on cars right in front on me or make out faces on people cutting in front of me on bikes and scooters.
4,This is the second Dash Cam I bought from Garmin the first is Garmin Dash Cam 46 it is very simple to use
5,Overall I like this dash cam. It's small footprint really tucks away so you can hardly see it. The Garmin drive software works and doesn't demand weird permissions like the Chinese brands do.
5,Excellent camera very easy to install especially with the magnet feature. That makes it easy to remove and reinstall in the car. Replaced the sd card that came with it with a much larger one and had no issues. You do need to format it though on a pc and then insert it formatting through the camera takes forever.Videos are very good no blurring or distortion regarldess of speed. Overall highly recommended.Did not use the smart phone app so cant comment on that.
3,Garmin support is the worst!  literally have to reset and reconnect this camera everytime we stop for the night.  no good...complicated with the app...could be so much better....
5,Super easy installation and the cam is small enough that it's hidden behind the mirror.  I've looked over some of the footage and it seems completely adequate.  Transfer via wifi to your phone is quite slow but you can always remove the micro sd and put it into a computer or your phone.  Very happy with the additional piece of mind and the unobtrusive install.
2,It’s Garmin so you know the quality is there.  However unless you don’t care if wires are hanging from the top of the windshield and the untidy appearance doesn’t bother you; it costs a bunch to get these cameras professionally installed.I am not qualified to take apart the headliner and molding of my truck to run the power cable into the engine compartment. That’s what it takes to hide the wires and do the job right. It’s difficult to find anyone who will do the work even In a city of two million. I finally found one guy who works at the dealership where I bought my truck. He has become the de facto expert at doing the work . The charge was pure labor for a little over 5 hours work. The charge was $645.00.
3,Tiene y buen tamaño y buena resolución. Pero necesita mejorar su app y la interacción con los móviles. Da trabajo la conexión con la cámara y su aplicativo.
4,Never know when it is recording bought 256 tab and is constantly asking to format I know it was formatted correctly that was the only directions that came with camera
5,This cam is so easy to install and set up. The app works great and saving pictures is easy. I like the extra features like stop alert and lane warning and the options of information to display on playback.
5,I bought this for the compact size and wide angle view. In addition this one had the convenient mag mount. Although the price may seem a bit high it was worth it for me for both piece of mind and safety. I hope I don’t ever have to use it for any mishaps but I will be prepared. In this day and age I think vehicles should all be equipped with dashcams.
5,I've bought 3 dash cameras over the years on business trips to China.  The Garmin doesn't wear out SD cards like the cheap ones and the imaging is far superior.
5,I've used this dash cam for 3 weeks. So far it does a great job! Like Its tiny design which can hide behind the rearview mirror.
2,The camera itself is fine and if you want to save your footage using the microsd card and exporting it directly into your laptop then its fine. But the software is horrid. The interface is ancient and not user friendly. Connecting to save a video never works gets constantly disconnected and is just really buggy. If they could figure out how to make the app and connecting more responsive it would be a 5 out of 5.
3,The camera itself is fine and has plenty of great features. However setting it up is quite the pain. You have to use Garmin's Drive app which only functions if you disable all ad blocking and privacy features on your phone and network. Absolutely ridiculous to have an app that has so much tracking built in it does not function if you don't want to be tracked.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Look to the right you'll see a car running a fence at a dead end and using it as a ramp to fly 20ft in the air.I've shared this on facebook and I swear I have made you guys some money!!! As you can see I drive alot only had this gem for 2 weeks!
4,It's small it's plug n play it's voice-activated and affordable.
5,I was pleasantly surprised by the great quality of the video images and audio captured by this device. Getting two mounting magnets (sticky side on the windshield metal on the interior which meets the magnet in the camera mount) is great. Allows the device to be moved quickly and easily between two vehicles.
1,After much debate I chose to buy my first Garmin product.  Spent the afternoon watching the mason delivery truck make its way around my city.  Made sure I was there to open the door for him to enter my apartment building.  Read the instructions and proceeded to setup my new dash camera the following morning.Started off easy and straight forward I was happy I went with Garmin at this point. Setup my account downloaded the app connected the camera to bluetooth and power.  Things were good.  Used the voice command to take a picture.  It was all coming together.  When I attempted to look at the still picture is when I had some issues.  Th eohone needed to connect to the camera via the cameras wifi.  OK easy enough.  NOPE...  Hours later and my camera is still not connected.  Call Center is closed because no one uses Garmin products on the weekend and the chat center lead me to a conversation with Paul.  His suggestion was to turn the unit on.  No good morning or how can I help.  It was turn the unit on then he sent me a link to the troubleshooting.  Zero accountability or even acknowledgment of the struggle to connect this new piece of technology.  Shame on Garmin for allowing this behavior.I'm returning my first and only Garmin product ASAP.  Already bought another brand and looking forward to not having to deal with this company again.  Garmin is a brand that seems to have grown so fast they forgot about the end customer.
5,Very easy to setup and even easier to use.Great picture quality.Best value for your money
3,The camera and recording capability is great and crystal clear however the app itself sucks. It doesn't connect to wifi on my phone half time to let me pull clips off that I need wirelessly other then that it's a great dash camera.
2,As a huge fan of Garmin navigational equipment I am sorry to say that this dashcam is just not ready for prime time. The first unit I received had to be returned for a replacement because the fully updated unit simply would not format a micro-SD card. The replacement unit formatted the card immediately so no complaints there. The size of the camera is perfect and I have no complaints regarding the video quality. The major failure here is with the Dash App and Wi-Fi. After three days of testing the camera uploaded only one brief video clip to the Garmin Vault and the camera had to be paired every time I started my vehicle; an annoying waste of time especially when you are paying up to $260. Sorry to say but I would strongly recommend that you avoid this item.
5,I bought this for my wife since she'd been asking for a dash cam (I've had a different dash cam in my truck for a couple of years) I wanted something easy to set up and use.  Not that my wife is tech challenged but I really wanted her to have something that she could use without having to remember much.  The voice controls work great the wifi vault sync is a nice feature as well and with the Garmin OBD-II constant power adapter set to 10 minutes the install was insanely easy.
1,This device could have been great but there is a MAJOR issue with it. If you do not open the DRIVE app every time you want recordings it will not remember the date and time from the last time it synced with your phone. You can see on the day that I opened the app it added the date and time but on a day when I did not there is nothing there.This also causes another issue. When I opened the app to look at my recordings ALL of them were dated the last time I had the app open. So a week's worth of recordings all were shown as one day.I pulled the card and looked at it in the computer same thing. It recorded all my driving but had no date and time and the files were all dated the last day it synced not the date and time they were actually recorded.I spoke to Garmin support at length about this and they told me "that's just the way it works". I found this in NO other reviews. I find it shocking that the unit cannot remember a date and time without having to connect to the drive app constantly. Because there is no GPS it needs to sync. It is incomprehensible that the power capacitor cannot hold a charge even overnight to remember the date and time.
2,I purchased the Garvin Dash Cam 67 w and the Garmin GPS with alexa. they do not work together. while the Garmin 67w took good video it was the glare from the windshield and dash that made these videos and pictures terrible. I contacted Garmin and there are no accessories to cut the glare. I also signed up for the Garmin Vault that is to upload your Dash Cam videos for 30 day storage never worked. did not upload a single video over a 2 week driving Trip through New England. While Garmin touts the connection to your phone to watch the videos and live video from the Dashcam you must reconnect each via WiFi to your phone each and every time. this is not a hands free operation and is quite envolved. While i did like the easy metal button on the windshield for a quick mount of the 67w it was always a ordeal for a reconnection to bluetooth on the phone to be able to give commands to the 67W.I can not recommend this product over others as the screen is really useless the storage upload useless and the finals output usually unrecognizable .
5,Super happy so far.  The camera is small and unobtrusive. That the best feature to me. Easy to use good picture but have seen better pic quality. Overall best for my needs
1,I relied on the Garmin name for quality. This definitely is not it. The camera is small unobtrusive and the voice activation is spot on. That's where the positives end. The "Drive" software that connects the device to the phone is buggy and honestly a piece of junk. I'm in IT and after my experience with Drive can't get it off my phone fast enough. The camera has difficulty connecting to the WiFi even within 20 feet of the high speed router. Images could upload via Bluetooth but Garmin chose WiFi.In a couple weeks of use there isn't a single image or video uploaded to the Garmin "Vault." As well even when Drive is turned off it's still running in the background trying to connect to WiFi to the point that my phone's warning comes up that Drive is occupying the WiFi to the point of exclusion of other apps. What junk! I have to restart my phone in order to hard stop the Drive software from engaging the WiFi on my phone. The micro SD card that came with the camera is so bad that after two picture captures it says the card needs to be formatted again. After three formats I gave up.Garmin rested on its laurels with this piece of junk. I cannot return it to Amazon fast enough. I'm beyond disappointed.  For the amount of money this dashcam costs I expected far more from a Garmin product. Never again. Now trying to find another dashcam. Stay far away from this item. Garmin if you're reading this shame on you for releasing a substandard product.
3,Unsaved clips are 60 seconds but pressing the SAVE button only saves 30 seconds. Needs a setting to change the default saved clip length.
5,Good quality product and easy to install. I didn't tuck the wire between windshield and seam as suggested. I just threaded it along the radio seam and dash and secured with black electrical tape. I spoiled the excess and secured with tape. Very good image still learning to save videos and take photots.
3,This works great when it works! But i have to constantly reconnect to my Bluetooth to my cell. To the point I'm going to return this product. Because I have go thru the app to reconnect all over again. It takes forever to do this. I bought 2 of these devices.
1,So you may or may not ever actually catch the event you desperately need to record. It depends on how the camera was feeling that day. You can't view an "unsaved" video unless you take the meme out card out and put it into a laptop/tablet/etc. So if it's an event that didn't automatically save or you didn't catch it and tell it to save...it becomes a hassle. Sometimes it shuts off for no reason and has to be rebooted. It's very picky about what kind of memory card it wants to accept. It's very hard to connect to my iPhone 13 pro. Sometimes it does sometimes it absolutely does NOT. I expected a better product from Garmin. This one has failed me several times and I now have 2 separate dash cams that record independently because I can't trust anybody them. Why can't anybody make a decent reliable dashcam?
5,Just wanted a second set of eyes in auto accidents.  Works exactly as promised.  Great small cam that is easy to use.
5,It is easy to install and has really great video and sound quality. It works amazing with the phone and connection. We had another (unnamed) dashcam and it was horrible.(ノಠ益ಠ)ノGarmin met my expectations and more and I highly recommend it to anyone asking.
3,Generally works good. But every couple weeks is goes stupid. The memory card has to be removed cleared and reinstalled. Not convenient when heading out on a trip.
1,Purchased this to put my mind at ease for 2 reasons.- any incidents that occur in front of me that would be best if i had video evidence to show I am not at fault.- capture any incidents that occur while my car is parked.Luckily I have never needed the camera for reason 1 but reason 2 was a huge reason why I purchased the Garmin.  I figured their name and reputation would be better than going with a random white box dash cam on Amazon.  Well I was wrong.  My car was hit from the side and the culprits pulled up in front of my car before finish panicking and driving off.  My neighbor's Ring camera caught them so I figured I would be good cause my dash cam would capture video for incidents just like this.  Well it did not.  I checked the settings and the sensitivity was set at the default and I cant imagine after my car being hit that hard that I caused it to hop the curb did not activate at all.I unfortunately cannot recommend this product because it did not do what it was advertised to do and it cost me my deductible.
5,Works like it is advertised it's out of the way no issues so far
3,Dashcam’s bluetooth feature is buggy it disconnects a lot.  Video image is pretty clear and the dashcam supports 512 gb micro sd card. Suction cup works great so far since it hasn’t come off the windshield yet.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Small enough it's not obstructing view works great so far can mute notifications app is a little buggy but I'm sure they will improve that
5,Used in Europe and the US. Works great. It’s a snap to install but you must  buy the suction cup mount and polarised filter (to protect the lens at least) to make your experience better. Runs cool and live view works on a 4 year old S9+ no problem.  It’s really small which is a huge plus.
3,Quede decepcionado por la calidad de imagen. En los videos y fotos de publicidad se veía de otra forma.Actualización: luego de unos días usando. Al estar pegada al parabrisa esta expuesta al sol cuando el auto está estacionado al sol la cámara no enciende no funciona. Necesitas estar a la sombra para bajar la temperatura.
2,In my case I received either a second hand open box or used one... Not returning it just because I need it for this weekend but in your case just make sure you order it with plenty of time to return it just in case you also receive a used one like me...
5,I installed this in my Jeep Gladiator.  Nice little unit.  Unobtrusive and you hardly know it's there.  The 1080p video quality is just fine for what it is.  Easy to set up and control with the Garmin Drive app.  I will probably get these for my wife and daughter's vehicles too.
2,Impossible to utilize the app and camera.  I called for help and actually got a human quickly to my surprise but he was like a robot demanding he send a set of instructions...  That did not work or help.  The few images that I was able to get were terrible.  The camera disconnected and locked up making it unusable.  I hope that mine was defective but I doubt it based on other reviews.  The camera got so hot I unplugged it to be safe.  I bought this based on past experiences and the name brand of Garmin.  What a disappointment.
5,I will be anxious to see how well it adheres over the summer when it’s hot. I hate how the wires hang all over the place so we did buy some clips.
5,After a lot of research and reading and viewing reviews I found this best for my new vehicle.Works really well and at a low cost. I’m a little disappointed that the camera went on sale s few days after ordering it!I’m using it on a 2021 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid Limited.
5,Highly recommend; easy setup
4,for the moment it's fine.
1,The camera and video quality are excellent but that’s not very useful when I can’t even export the videos. The camera rarely successfully connects to my phone and when it does the videos do not download. I guess I have to get an SD card adapter for my computer. This is what I specifically wanted to avoid when choosing a dashcam.Update: I tried downloading the video files into my computer but the camera stores them on the SD card as short clips with zero organization and out of chronological order. It is trial and error to find a specific clip from a specific day and even then I have 2 different video files for an event that happened to occur around the file split. This camera is entirely not useful with how hard it is to access the recordings.Update: The camera stopped saving videos to the SD card altogether and no longer connects to my phone. I have changed nothing with the hardware or software setup. This camera is the complete opposite of convenient or user friendly. STAY AWAY!
2,Very small would be awesome if it actually worked.  I had a helluva time getting the SD card formatted their helpdesk didn't have any suggestions but at least I got to speak with a live person who tried.LED's alternated colors that aren't described on the online LED statuses.  With two buttons you're supposed to figure out the combos to work all the features and functions without a display so a consistent wifi connection is kinda important.I bought a second camera thinking the 1st one was bad.  Nope.  Returning both.
3,Came an seems to function as expected but the cigarette car charger died in 5 days of use. Replaced with a quality power supply and works for now.  Hopefully the camera is better built.
5,Very good product surely I recommend it.small and perfect. I am planning to buy one more.
1,If you asked me to write a review after 1 week this would be 5/5.However I have had this now for several months and I can list some problems. The most important is that every couple of days the camera loses its connection with my phone/car wifi requiring me to remove the old connection and redo the pairing. I have done this 3 times in the last 2 weeks. For the record if it’s not pairing the device is also not recording. So you have to check every time you get in the car to see if it works or not.My second problem is when you try to watch a recorded video it completely screws up CarPlay disconnecting you from the CarPlay.Lastly maybe this is the case with every dashcam but you can only watch the recorded videos while you are in the car unless you purchase vault access.Overall nothing is horrible and maybe because this is my first dashcam this is just something that all devices struggle with. However I think if I could do it again I would get another device. Maybe I have an isolated problem but doesn’t seem worth it.
5,This camera has automatically collusion video safe feature if something gonna be happened automatically save the clip in your camera memory card and you can also download the aap in your camera and see all videos and pictures during travel
2,If you are expecting to use this camera with your phone look elsewhere. The only thing you will ever see on your phone is the attached image. No matter how many times you click Join you will NEVER connect. I've tried with android and apple devices. The only option for viewing photos or videos from this device is by pulling the SD card out and connecting it to your computer. And if you're like me and forget to take your SD card back to the car the camera will do nothing but beep loudly and flash it's lights maniacally until you unplug it.Please spend the extra money and get a good camera. Don't make the same mistake I did.
1,I believe I received a repurposed camera. This camera came in an unsealed box. When I opened it everything was kind of thrown in the box. No instructions. The memory card was loose in the box and I was lucky to find it. It is also an 8GB card and not a 16GB card as advertised. Also the camera will NOT under any circumstances connect to the Garmin Drive app through Bluetooth. I can’t say the issue is with the camera as my phone recognizes the camera. It’s the app that won’t recognize the camera.
5,We've been very satisfied. Easy to look at video and great quality video. We're going to buy another one for our truck!
2,1- The camera doesn’t work sometimes and I have to unplug it and wait for 10 seconds and plug it to make it work again.2- When I try to export the video in the mobile app it fails.
5,Best bang for the buck if you factor in the Garmin support and the excellent app its based around.  So often with less expensive dash cams you either lose the recording you need or there was some other hiccup in the system.  This one just works and is well worth it.
5,I did a lot of research and reviews were right...this is a super camera! Just right high quality great images.
2,Day 1 - I've just started using it and I'm noticing it takes a while to start recording. Set up was ok. My car has wifi so I imagine that helps. It would suck trying to be close enough to house to set up. At this point I wouldn't recommend it.
3,I would say it works about 30% of the time. Sometimes I’ll say ‘hey garment’ and it doesn’t do anything. I don’t like that it has to be connected to wifi to work. Thinking about doing more research and getting one that works 100% of the time.
5,Turns on instantly when starting car and records great
5,I’m the first week I had this up caught a major crash that was helpful for police investigation and insurance purposes! Easy to save video to phone and send to anyone!
5,Excellent quality pictures with ease of use and super quick installation. Definitely a great buy for peace of mind and travel protection. I highly recommend this camera.
1,The good:- easy set up.- onboard microSD 16gb.- really good wide angle.- solid voice control.The bad:- What garmin meant to say is that they are charging over $200 for a 1440p dash cam that is really more like 480p camera with an ISO around 8000. The images and video ARE GRAINY AF which means the details (which matter in court) are not present as they are obliterated by noise.- horrid image and video quality. Not even remotely close to whats advertised. First video was from my driveway on 1440p at 30fps and not even moving. Cant even make out the plates or logo on a vehicle. The entire point of ultra HD cameras is to...capture all the details.
5,The picture quality is very clear and the Garmin app makes it very easy to install and connect. This is the dash cam I’ve had so far for the price.
5,Small size doesn't block your view good video quality mobile app allows easy viewing of videos without removing memory card. Parking monitor mode actually works (unlike other dashcams)
1,Read all of the other reviews where people had issues with iPhone connectivity. Thought to myself it is Garmin it can’t possibly be the camera got to be operator error. Well I’m an idiot for ignoring the other reviews. It is the camera. Had to send it back there was zero way around it because you have no built in screen so it has to work with the phone. Really wanted it to work. Tried all of the “tricks and tips” people listed. Paired forget pair again Wi-Fi on Wi-Fi off etc. The form factor was great build quality seemed very good was exactly what we were looking for. It is incredible that they did not catch this issue in the QA process. Garmin should be embarrassed. Phone used was a 12 Pro with the latest iOS 15.5
2,The most important thing to note is that this camera does not have a view screen or any menu buttons. Virtually all functions and setup are via Bluetooth using the Garmin Drive app. Camera status is displayed with different colored lights that require the manual to decode. I got the camera working then the next day it would not connect to my phone or start recording. I ended up returning this dashcam and going with a more expensive Garmin cam.
5,It is discreet easy to install and convenient.I have a Mazda CX5 and I bought also an adapter to connect it directly to the mirror no need of hiding the cable. But it is possible only in some Mazda models.
3,So far this is the best dash cam I've used. It has great image quality and it's really easy to capture snapshots/short videos with one button (bottom right). I also like that it has a Travelapse feature for recording trips. The big downer is the app. It's really terrible to use very clumsy to get the videos you want off the card and onto your computer.
5,You don’t need it until you need it. Picture quality isn’t really great but it will work for me.
2,The camera works fine.  But the app is useless.  It won't let me connect to the camera with wifi.  I can't stream video view recordings or update the camera.  I have to plug the camera directly into my laptop to do anything.  This makes the main reason I got the camera over another brand useless.
3,Not happy with video/photo quality. I cannot see the license plates. It has some nice features but the most important thing it's meant to do it can't do well. I can barely use the photage.
5,Good quality picture and recording features. Super wide angle captures everything. Easy install and setup. Garmin app works great and pairs easily with my S10 Samsung phone. A must for truck drivers. Like having extra insurance.
2,Worked fine then recording began stopping and starting again every 20 seconds. Now it won’t connect to Bluetooth.Out of Amazon return window by 2 weeks trying Garmin 1 year warranty… hopefully works out. Liked it until it broke.
3,Pros:Very compact fairly easy installation decent quality camera and live view from appCons:The display on my unit seems defective and has streaks and lines of distorted color (live view on app is ok) features (lane assist collision detection etc.)  are gimmicky and rather uselessWill update this review when I receive the replacement.
1,The camera is small and has acceptable image quality.It gets very hot at the top and is made of a plastic that could easily be improved.The manual is very bad and you don't have all the information you need.The voice detection doesn't always work well.When I received the camera I had to update the firmware and my Samsung card did not detect it even though it was the type required by garmin. I had to look for a Scandisk for only 32gb that did accept it and I was finally able to connect to the app. Then I had to insert the Samsung and from the app if I could format it but the camera does not allow formatting without the app and the Bluethoot does not always work .... Also it does not seem normal that the camera comes without a protection on the lens so after all this I proceed to return it.
5,Great mini size simple good app
5,The media could not be loaded.
2,Despite the red light being on this does not always record video. Had an incident and went back to find the video and it recorded NOTHING. Completely sporadic functionality. Very disappointing.
2,I have a 66w that I love it captures 1 minute clips that can be trimmed. Bought the 67w thinking I’d love it even more but I was wrong. When I save a video manually it only captures 15 seconds before and 15 seconds after. Therefore when I save a clip it doesn’t show the entire incident. I was told by customer service that they made the clip length shorter because people complained about having to trim the clips. I’d rather have to trim a video than to not have the entire video!!!
2,I really wanted to like this dashcam but I couldn't.What works:The tiny size that makes it stealth.The voice commandsWhat doesn't  work:The picture and video quality.The abysmal app connectivity and vault upload/download experience.
1,By the condition and sealing of the box I got a used device. When I unboxed I realized some elements were already overly used (ie glue of the attachment). Finally after 10 days of use the microSD card stopped working.Per Garmin’s site:“SD memory cards wear out after they are overwritten a large number of times.”In summary: spent $300 on one of the most expensive dashcams out there but it stopped working 10 days after first use.Do not buy.
2,I like everything except the fact that when I tried to retrieve the video when its on parked mode it doesn't work. It just buffering. Freezing and crashed. And   that is the only reason I bought to be able to monitor the car while in the parking lot. The app just doesn't work.  I'll return for refund. So disappointed ☹️☹️
1,Garmin has released a product that by their own admission has compatibility issues with iOS 15; folks steer  clear if you're an Apple iPhone user. The basic truth is it won't work. I bought one and spent hours trying to install it. Seeing the initial positive reviews I figured the camera must be defective; return period had passed so I ordered another because I really really liked the small footprint and the mount. Same thing - worthless. Then I probed more deeply into the reviews and saw the compatibility problems that this unethical company does not reveal before you buy. I have a smart home and have had home surveillance cameras at four houses so I'm very familiar with this technology. I gave up on this relatively expensive camera for a $39 70mai Smart dash cam that does the same thing with equally good camera good app easy to set up good mount - no brainer!
5,Small in dimensions Big in quality and handling. Garmin Drive App is very convenient.
3,You are able to see license plates only at the day light on the short distance not at night  at all.P.s. lense is clean as well as windshield.
2,Picture is great formats SD card for you but it died after a few months. Almost got into a wreck (it automatically saves video if you brake too hard) when it activated it shut off. Tried different wires different ports (USB and car) and tried connecting to the computer (which was hard enough to get off windshield) .
1,I really liked this dashcam but after 5 months it started to reboot and shutoff randomly. A couple weeks later it completely died (of course past the return window timeframe). I can’t afford to spend this every 6 months so I will have to look for a better built more reliable dashcam.
3,Great camera. I installed it in my 21 Subaru Crosstrek with Eyesight.
3,The Mini 2 won't add itself to my Garmin Drive App and the Dashcam 57 makes a high pitch rattle sound when traveling at highway speeds. I am not impressed Garmin. Tempted to return both and try another brand since your support doesn't seem super interested in getting to a final resolution with me.
5,Super small and easy to use!
1,Received item quickly from amazon; followed the instructions for set up and it tried to update the software and ran for 4 hours until I realized it was caught in some kind of loop.  Tried several times to install but same problem.  After some searching on the internet I found this to be a common problem.  Returned item.  Thankfully I ordered from Amazon as the return was easy.
5,It is very nice and small cam. Easy to set up
3,This cam is not Compatible with my 4G smartphone only during installation I got this error message  so I had to return it
1,Edit: new unit does the same. When installed in the car and not between 50 to 70 F the unit thermal switch won’t allow the unit to work. The device does not record display or function when out of the temperature range. The user can force it to reboot but it’s unclear whether it would do anything at that point. Not for automotive use in the cold climates or any hot climates or a automotive environment. Garmin support instructions are to store it in the house which is why this is a good table cam/ paper weight.Unit maybe defective will update if this failure does not repeat.3 day old Garmin does not work in the car at winter temperatures. The unit as described by Garmin Support only operates at 32F to 90F. Current temperatures are lower at 20F and in the summer I can see the temperatures going to 140F in a closed car.So will try a replacement however this cam is designed not to work in a car. It’s better for a table as a paper weight .
2,I usually love Garmin products especially my bicycle computers but this thing isn’t ready for prime time. Initially it took me the better part of an hour to install a firmware update. Once updated and connected to my phone the Garmin app would take too long to become fully connected. I was never able to get live video to display on my iPhone which was strike 3. On its way back good riddance.
5,The dashcam is really good.
2,Camera works ok and does record video but Garmin support is worthless. The device can't be used in the way that it is designed and their comment - "We don't support that" Then why do you even have it as an option? If the device can't connect to a WiFi AP then you should assist with determining why otherwise don't put the feature on the device.
1,3 out of 10 times the camera doesn’t turn on when I start the vehicle. Defeats the purpose of a dash cam if it doesn’t turn on. I have it hard wired with the parking module. Customer service is no help
2,Many people are finding the app has major flaws it keeps searching and trying to use your wifi causing your phone to give you errors/ warnings. Only way to fix problem is to un install app of course then you can not use 98% of the functions of why you bought dashcam. You have to remove sd card EVERYTIME you want to see or copy video. App owners have been unresponsive to everyone's complaints about it
2,The camera features are good. However when you want to download videos most of the videos are not available. There is in 60% of the videos a timer running and not ending. Even after 20 minutes the videos were still not available. It takes to remove the sd card and download them on a computer. Not very helpful when you need immediate evidence after an accident.
1,Worked a little with a Google Pixel 4a. Pixel 6a doesn't connect at all. Wasteof $120. Should have known better than to spend money on another Garmin product.They went down the tubes a long time ago.
2,Keeps malfunctioning. Won't run right? Keeps resetting. Won't stay on. Don't recommend buying
5,Great camera and simple to use! Great app experience and love the Geo tagging and speed tracking too! Videos automatically upload when connected to my home wifi so I can see them in the app. Very happy with this cam!
5,excelente producto.
5,Small excellent video quality and blue tooth capable
1,Received two bars of soap inside the sealed package and box. Requesting refund in progress. Total waste of time and headache and stressful when needing this item for the new car.
1,Hey Garmin Wake up  we are in 2022!If you don't use the App it's a perfect old fashion Dash-Cam. You have to remove the memory card and retrieve the pictures manually to your computers!If you want to have access to the pictures on your cellphone through the Garmin App it literally doesn't have that feature! The App is not working! I have to try multiple times to connect this camera to the App to see pictures! Most of the times I am not lucky just like other users. This is very annoying and I can't understand why Garmin doesn't fix it by pushing a software update.In additional to this issue Garmin is still living in 90s because this camera is recording only 2k videos!
2,Has a hard time finding and loading on my phone
2,I have seen a lot of good reviews on this product  however in my experience the dash cam gets really hot and the weather is not even warm yet.  With that said I would not recommend this product.
1,A discussion of Dash Cameras yielded an adamant Happy Vote from one fellow for the Garmin Dash Cam 57 as being practical and of exceptional quality. It's probably all that but I forgot from a prior Garmin GPS mega-expenditure that after a ton of software installation to use the software a person has to log on to their Garmin account. Since I spend 2/3rds of the time far from Internet or Cell Service it was unsuitable for my intended use and I wanted to remember to never purchase Garmin again. But that was years ago and I forgot. The requirement to log on follows hours of installations - Drive App won't let the Bluetooth part work away from connections. Dad flub it! There is no excuse for Garmin demanding logging in for a Bluetooth connection between phone and camera. I'm furious at myself!!! This new camera will probably rot in a drawer like the GPS did. I suggest that you buy Chinese knockoff cameras.
2,Device connection with the app is very poor. Requiring one to restart app and restart phone and reset cam over and over. Aint nobody got time for dat. I am returning this thing and buying a different dash cam.
1,Bluetooth isnt working. Buttons on the dashcam dont do anything. Lights come on tho. Been fiddling with it so I got the yellow lights to go away but stays solid green no matter what i do. The app cant do anything since bluetooth doesnt work. Meh.
1,If you have an iPhone do not buy this camera. I only saw the many other reviews by others with this problem after I bought the product. Hours of time wasted trying to get it to work.I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max running iOS 15.6. I’ll be spending more time to send this camera back.Posting this to save others with iPhones from wasting their time.
1,For the price and brand I guess I expected this item to always power on and be ready. It seemed like half the time it would power on with the vehicle and work other half didn’t function until unplugging power and trying again. Didn’t always listen for the boot up chime just expected it to turn on when power applied. Retuned unit.
2,Connecting this Garmin Dash Cam Mini 2 to my iPhone has been a long struggle. It appears to be recording  video when it’s powered up but the “Live View” doesn’t work and viewing the files is a major challenge.
1,Still has an overheating problem. I've bought several supported SD cards all of them have issues self overwritting when the card is full. Sometimes the captured video is just a blank white screen. Voice commands are spotty. Sometimes works sometimes activates itself. Don't buy for the garmin name it doesn't exist anymore. Now I'm having issues pulling off video to my phone. Terrible UI for the app. Why am I trying to use a slider across hours of footage? Didn't think to let me enter a time stamp? I bought this to cover myself incase I ever got into an accident. Thank God I haven't needed it because it probably wouldn't work.
1,It worked well until I had it installed for about 5 months then it would randomly stop recording and fail to turn back on when unplugged and plugged back in or when the car was turned off and turned back on. I thought the Garmin name meant I was getting a quality product but that clearly isn't the case. Also don't expect to be able to read a license plate unless you are less than a car length away from the other vehicle.
1,Pretty simple. The camera itself looks good. Records well. But it has terrible terrible software. It randomly clips video footage (literally recorded for 20 minutes and cut one section I needed for an accident) processes insanely slow to export loses connection constantly.For $300 this has to do better.
2,I expected a Garmin product to be trouble free and very reliable. But I am getting a lot of glitches with warnings that the card is slowing down and I need to delete files. It would seem that overwriting old files when the card gets full should not cause operational issues but it does seem to happen. Sometimes the unit will frequently beep requiring a reboot.
5,Really good dashcam easy to setup app works well very small and easy to hide behind a mirror. Tried other non-brand one’s and they were way more complicated big and difficult to use.  Glad we went with the Garmin!
5,High quality dashcam at a good pricepoint
2,It seems with every software update this camera gets worse and worse. The video quality is outstanding no issue there. However this camera used to record 1.5 minutes before and 1.5 minutes after a detected event or voice triggered recording for a total of three minutes. Now it only records 15 seconds before and 15 seconds after a detected event or voice triggered recording for a total of 30 seconds. This is not enough time. I do not recommend this camera. You should look for another brand.
1,First off Install is easy but the app for this device is horrible. Sometimes the videos load and sometimes they don’t. Most of the time I can’t find the video I told it to save or anything it records for that matter. Which obviously that’s a bad characteristic for a dash cam because if you got Into an accident where you needed footage to prove you are not at fault. Wouldn’t recommend ESPECIALLY for the price.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 2nd day of using this cam and caught an accident. This is must have cam for your car.
2,The item description and box states that it comes with a micro SD card but it didn't. The box was also not sealed but the camera itself seems brand new.
1,I ordered this because the description says it came with a 16GB SD card included.  First one I received the SD card was not in the plastic envelope that it was supposed to be in and was only 8GB. I requested a return and another order.  I received it quickly but the next order was the same.  The SD card that came with it was only 8GB and it was not even in the envelope it should have been.  Not ordering again.
2,Very happy at size and the picture good.  Our camera got hot even though it is winter after 20 minutes of driving so we returned it.  Waiting until the next version comes out to try again.
1,It only comes with windshield mount. However product is too heavy to stay glued against the gravity. Since there is no option to mount in the dashboard you'd have to ask your passenger to hold the camera while you drive.
1,I’m a long-time Garmin customer and have nothing but good to say about their products…until now.  The 67w dash cam is flawed in hardware and software.  Its hard to believe this is a Garmin product.Where to start…. Picture quality is dark and shaky.  Compared to the Rove R2-4K it is horrible.  The Garmin app is just as bad.  It boasts of cloud backup but the videos don’t upload fast and the vehicle is off before anything can upload.It sounds great in the product details but you’re spending 2x or 3x as much for an inferior product.  What happened with Garmin?  This is not like any other product I’ve owned from this company.
1,This camera’s size and video quality are great. I really wanted to like it. The problem is reviewing video from the app was an absolute nightmare. Videos randomly just show a spinning circle and never load and you cannot play them back. So 2 recordings are good 3-6 cannot be played back then another good one then another 5 that can’t be played. I worked with Garmin support and through that whole process purchased another “approved SD card” reinstalled the app factory reset my iPhone and even RMA’d the camera. They still couldn’t make it useable so I had to work with Amazon to get a refund. An awful experience.
2,Garmin dash cam 47. These do not record all the time. Mine has missing footage that I needed from a day and was not there and I know the camera was on and recording according to the red light that was on.
1,very buggy app wifi on camera wont work 80% of the time. Camera bugs once per 2-3 weeks..
1,Overall I did not like the camera at all. It says 1440p but can not capture license plates even at the short distance. I changed it to 1080p 60fps and it got worse.Garmin App - I am used to Canon app so I was not having great hopes with the app. But it is worse. I faced wifi connection issues the first time. Had to reinstall everything and worked 2nd time. File transfer takes forever. I could not find solution to transfer videos in Macbook.After buying such an expensive product I was hoping for better overall solution and I did not like this product at all.
1,Will not always start when engine is started. Cannot connect with Garmin Drive. Very disappointed.
5,The dash cam works just fine. Most importantly it's made in Taiwan and not in China so go for it.
1,Bought this one because I wanted something I could trust to always work. Found myself constantly having to make sure it was recording half the time or more it was not. Finally figured out how to fix that then it worked fine for about a week. Went back to being iffy. Now it won’t even get power to the camera. Unfortunately I spent the $140 because I wanted quality and good gear ended up being the complete opposite of that. Will be returning it
1,Bought this for the form factor and garmin brand but holy cow has this been a frustrating experience (and I’m good at setting up IOT devices).The Garmin Drive app seems unable to “add as accessory” even though my phone has added the camera and connected via bluetooth. After several troubleshooting sessions the tech support yielded nothing productive.Garmin must have spent all their dev money on the hardware because the app is unusable and it’s the only way to interface with the device.Steer clear of this or wait for a revision.
1,Garmin support? Useless.Garmin Mini 2? Won't connect to drive app or anything for that matter. Sitting at my desk just trying to get the thing to broadcast bluetooth or show up at all anywhere for the last 2 hours. What a pile of trash.Please do not put yourself through the nightmare that is trying to use the apps on for this device. I wasted most of a saturday afternoon with it. Never again. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING GARMIN. Their apps are utterly useless.
1,This is just a preliminary review. Haven’t used it as yet.Taking it out of the box and observing the cam I would have to give full marks on what I feel is good build quality. I’m rather taken back by how small it is.Here’s where I have an issue. Perhaps minor to some but as a photographer I’m surprised there isn’t any protection for the protruding fisheye lens. They have a removable thin plastic film to protect the screen but nothing to protect the most important part of the camera the lens. Ok so it’s facing down in the box but it should have something to protect it. Because the lens protrudes  out it is very vulnerable to scratches and possible damage. It wouldn’t cast much to provide a plastic cover. Every lens I have purchased over the years for my cameras came with removable/replaceable covers.
1,Promises a lot and doesn’t follow through.The red light camera warning is about the only thing that works. Front impact collision warning is garbage- doesn’t work and it’s the whole reason why I bought this specific camera in the first place. Hard to download the footage it does record too.Overall I wouldn’t recommend this.
2,The description reads that it includes a microSD memory card. None in the box or none pre-installed in the dash cam. Beware!
1,If i buy a 140 dollar product on the internet i want it working when i open the box. what is microsd card that i need? i dont know where to get. i know where to return stupid camera thou
1,I dislike that it never works and always needs to be powered down to work again
5,receive what is ordered.
1,Work great. Out of the box and worked for 1 to 2 days then would not connect. Could not view videos from phone
2,Some company have trouble to jump into the 21 century... Doesn't support SDcard greater than 32Gb because it recognizes only fat32 format... I have to say: this is not funny... Still usable though.
1,I could not get the app to sync after multiple tries and troubleshooting. If you put the camera anywhere else than the windshield the picture will not reorient. Why do they call it a dashcam when it's really a windshield cam?
1,After using this dash camera for a week and contacting Garmin customer service I found out the "Live Feed" feature not working properly and the Camera keeps disconnecting from Wifi. So this important feature is useless. Garmin told me that I have to buy " Constant Power Cable from them for $50.00. I think this company is trying to make money from its customers by misleading them about their products. I most probably return this camera.
5,Makes parking and backing out easier
1,After sticking it on it fell off after one day.  Then it kept falling off!  I ordered new sticky pads from 3M and it fell off less than a day.It is useless if you can't stick it on and have it stay on!So now I don't have a dash cam that is working.
1,Known Bluetooth connection issues.  They shipped a replacement camera.  The second camera still won’t connect to Bluetooth (iPhone).I spent a couple days trying to connect with Bluetooth and no luck (I’m young and build software for a living).  I called the manufacturer and explained the issue.  They immediately said they would send another because it’s a known issue .  I just got the second camera delivered and this won’t connect to Bluetooth either.I have an iPhone.  I fallow all the steps to pair with the app.  When I get to the “select an accessory” step the camera does not show up in the list.This review is for the dash cam mini 2.  I’m using an iPhone to try and pair with Bluetooth.
1,After a week of use it's going back.  The bluetooth rarely connects to my phone and I have no other Bluetooth device issues.  One time the camera wouldn't turn on and needed multiple reboot attempts before it worked again.  Junk
5,Excellent camera
1,The Mini 2 is absolute garbage. First camera stopped turning on within the first week. Had it replaced and the second camera started doing the same thing within days. I confirmed the power source and USB cables were not the issue and it's cool spring weather which eliminates overheating as a factor. Both cameras only turn on about 60% of the time so I can only conclude Garmin makes garbage (still).
1,Could not always get the camera to connect to the phone. Had trouble setting it up but eventually got it working. Worked fine for about 10 days. Went to look at the video on my phone but the camera hadn't been recording for 6 days. The red light was on indicating it was recording but nothing. The WiFi signal it puts out is extremely week.
1,Worked great at first but now the camera randomly won't power on (I've had it almost 3 months). Have to disconnect it for several minutes in order to get it to power on. Then the camera stops saving video. The red light comes on like it should and it will connect to my phone but I'll go to the temporary files through the app and it's empty.  Only solution i have found is reformatting the SD card. This of course only works temporarily and I have to check it every time I drive to ensure it's recording. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
1,8 days after the return window ends and camera is dead. I have owned the day cam for 38 days total and now it is useless. What a waste of money. The previous dash cam i owned was nothing to write home about but lasted over a year. I thought I should buy a name brand unit and Garmin has a good reputation. I have owned many Garmin products and been happy with them until now. Please save yourself some headache and go with anything other than this unit.
5,This product is small and easy install
5,Interface with iphone works well.
1,I bought a class 10 Micro SD card from a local store to get it rolling. It mostly did not store any videos. It would for a little while after a format then just stopped working again. I bought the recommended SanDisk extreme micro SD card to see if that fixed the issue and it's doing the same thing. Even got an alert the card was slowing down and to format it. So I don't think it's the card but a defective unit. My return windows has passed by a couple of weeks so I'll see what their warranty end up being.
1,From the start it has a somewhat cumbersome set up in regards to pairing. One month into using it in my vehicle and the dashcam has now started restarting itself over and over while driving thus rending itself completely useless for the intended purpose. Of course it would start do this just days after the return policy expires as well. Buyer beware.
2,Not clear enough
1,If you are buying this camera for the accessibility the advertised software includes look elsewhere. On initial set up the app worked great unfortunately it has never worked again. initially I was able to watch video and everything. Now it says a software update is ready but it wont connect to the camera to update. It never connects for any video playback. Even when it does say its connected to wifi it still wont connect and and now it none of the replay or live play video options connect nor will it connect and update. It is now a useless lump of plastic glued to my windshield.  I want my money back!
2,Its viewable on your mobile thru Bluetooth except if it is connected to your car audio.
1,The video and picture quality is good. Everything else is overly complicated. The Garmin Drive app is unintuitive. You cannot download the photos/videos on your phone to empty the sd card. If you are able to it takes a lot of time for it to properly connect and you can only attempt one video at a time. The only easy way to download the files is by removing the sd card and plugging it into your computer.  But don't forget to bring back to the dashcam afterwards.
1,Great size horrible cámara if you want to actually read a license plate. When looking at images on iPhone and you zoom and the image is complete distorted. You can see the car but can not make out any license plate.
5,Extra windshield holder
1,I was unable to setup the unit since the software and hardware were incompatible.  The camera would not enter pairing mode regardless of how long the save button was held down.  3 hours of time wasted.
2,Won’t easily connect. Didn’t record when I needed it.
1,
1,Useless. Does not connect to phone.
1,this was easy to install and is almost invisible.picture quality is ok at best.connection to the phone app while in the car works very slow. and that’s if it even connects.remote connection  is so unreliable it’s useless.I expected better from garmin.this camera is an embarrassment for them.
1,Wouldn’t connect to phone seems to be a common issue.
1,Camera won't stay on. Keeps turning on and off and beeping. Have tried talking to tech support and they keep telling me to switch power cables. I've done that doesn't work.Doesn't come with directions and the help section doesn't actually offer anything helpful.
1,Was great all winter and spring then we had one 80 degree day and the thing is fried… what’s the point of a dash cam that only works in the cooler months? What an absolute waste of money.
1,Spent a couple of hours wiring into my truck. Since this is the same one in my wife’s car.  Defective camera after I have cut  and spliced the wires so no returns. FYI bench test before you start to install
1,I bought two of these dash cams for me and my wife. The description says it comes with an SD card. I opened both of them to see that the SD cards were not included and both cameras looked used/refurbished. I returned them and bought them straight from Garmin's website. Spend a little more and buy this from Garmin.
1,Put in an SD card (per their spec) powered it up and it did nothing.  Wouldn't record any images wouldn't pair with my phone.  Life is too short to go through days of debugging with Garmin when there are lots of other dashcams on the market.
2,Im happy with video quality its the playback and access to images functiondoesnt work with out good wifi
1,What a hunk of junk. If I could give this pos negative stars I would. Sure it sets up easily and works with its app. However I get into an accident this morning and it recorded nothing. Not one video. Don't waste your money as it fails when you need it.
1,Not sure if the device is defective or just a piece of junk.  My car will not find it the light will not blink so the pairing process will happen. Two cords inside the long one not long enough to go around your headliner and back to the usb plug. Would need to be a lot longer.  Not sure if I will try this one again and see if it is a fluke or try a different brand.
1,I could not get this camera to work. I like the small profile which is great but the buttons did not do anything. I could not get it to format the SD card nor could I get it to connect to Bluetooth. I used a laptop to format the SD card and then the camera light turned green but it did not record and did not connect to Bluetooth. I am returning this camera and going with a Rove camera instead.
1,The video quality is very bad and it keeps on freezing the video in playback modeThe only good thing about this dashcam it’s small size which doesn’t obstruct the view specially on smaller windshields
1,Pretty much nothing works with this dash cam.  It was a good idea that just doesn't deliver.  I plan to return it tomorrow.It constantly flashes that it is updating.  You can't view video or pictures in the app.  The app is pretty much junk too.It sticks to the windshield well.  I'll be scraping that off tomorrow.
1,I am having the very same problem as many other victims of the Mini 2. The WebView refuses to connect and thus renders the camera unusable. Customer service (Garmin) was useless as was all the google searches that I did. Do Not Buy!
2,If this thing has a feature for parking guard what good is it if there is no battery.....  likely going to return this......  the battery last about 10 minutes max?
2,The software is flaky the connection to mobile devices flaky and the lane and front collision alerts are horrible
1,Bought this months ago. Camera would not pair to phone so I contacted customer service. After providing info about problem including sending event data to them they have never gotten back to me about solving this problem. I would get different camera.
1,Overheats and Shuts off it took a long time to cool down before I could restore power. It constantly losesconnection within the app or it says it's only partially connected. It's too finicky and unreliable I spend tomuch time trouble shooting it to be any kind of satisfied.
1,We had it for close to two months. It stops recording unexpectedly & at times wouldn't even start recording ... Would not recommend.
1,nice little camera but connecting via wifi or bluetooth an absolute nightmare will be replacing with a different brand camera
1,Just unboxed my dashcam and the memory card was nowhere to be found. Tried one that I had and has been formatting for 30 minutes.  Will give it a day or two otherwise will exchange for new one.
1,Purchased prior to a four week RV trip to Utah and Arizona. Unit stopped powering up during week two and no longer works. Sending back for a refund.
1,It said you can monitor your vehicle wile away and send you notifications. You can only connect when in the car or close to it .
1,App never connects to camera to view video. I have tried on multiple occasions. Look elsewhere for a camera because if something happens and you need to show someone the video you are screwed because you can't connect to the camera.
1,after 2 months its not working and dnt waste ur money on this one my return window is close waste of money
1,Great idea and very small but have had three each only lasts about six months.  After that they record but won’t let you view the recordings.
1,The app which is obviously required given the lack of a display is absolute garbage and refuses to run on fully updated Android phones.Completely useless.
1,Imposible to see videos
1,Had to exchange the first because it wouldn’t stay on or connect to my phone. Replacement works better but keeps wanting to formate memory card which erases the saved videos. Bluetooth playback and live video quality is very poor.
1,Camera goes through memory cards and will not connect to app or PC to run a system update.
1,Arrived defective
1,I worked for several days trying to get this camera operational...charged the battery made sure the memory card was in place dowloaded the app...I could never get the camera to work...very disappointing
1,this customer is not the naivest of people but I was unable to set it up. After multiple resets and switching off the device and iPhone a few times it was time to give up. Customer service appears to be non existent. Have just returned it to the Kohls drop off just 2 hours or so after receiving it.
1,I like the size but i dont like the frame rate. Choppy frame rate when reviewing saved vids not as clear as i expected. Frame rate is slow. I expected a more smooth frame rate for the price of the camera i would have rather bought a nexar camera or some other brand available with same if not better qualities.
1,I have 2 dash cams. Both cameras need to be reset every time I use them. It's either memory card slow errors or connection issues. They also cause my phone to have issues with playing music over bluetooth idk how but if I unplug them the issue stops. I bought the recommended memory cards.
1,Trash not real time live view just sit close to camera for live view even you leave Hotspot on your car connected with dash cam go little far app says dash cam not connected for anything
1,So this is annoying.  For this kind of money it should pair to the phone.  I am returning after spending an hour with this POS in the snow.  Done with Garmin products.
1,Seriously who though that this would pass as a quality product in todays day and age?Horrid 1080p quality runs hot and has poor features. I do not recommend this product or other Garmin cams after this attempt.
1,This dash cam does not work on iOS 15.0.1. The installation stopped at Select Accessory screen (after pairing). I tried to use Garmin Express (Mac version) to update the firmware but the software did not recognize the dash cam. I had to return this dash cam and bought the Garmin Mini (older version) instead.
1,I tried two of these cameras and neither one worked.  The first one simply died after about a week of working and the replacement camera would never complete the install and sync to my phone.  Very disappointing as I usually have success with Garmin products.
4,I bought this camera locally instead of Amazon as it was faster and cheaper that way (the Amazon fees for shipping are simply too high for my country).It records sharp 1440p video and is flawless. If you have saved any videos the camera will upload to vault through Wi-Fi when it detects no power. The viewing angle is really wide (wider than your vision but with a slight distortion on the edges). Once again the Vault option uploads saved videos (saved by you or when the camera detects an incident) when it is connected to Wi-Fi and the camera detects no power. They stay there for 24 hours. You can also access the camera feed remotely if it is powered on and connected to the Internet through Wi-Fi.The voice commands work even when there is music in the background but I have found myself repeating the "OK Garmin" word 2-3 times on occasion since it didn't understand me.The camera itself is nearly perfect (disregarding it's somewhat less-than-perfect voice recognition the voice recognition does work but the wake command "OK Garmin" sometimes need to be repeated for the camera to understand) however the reason it is four stars instead of five is regarding the Garmin Drive app.Frequently it would fail to connect fully it would connect but say to wait until it is fully connected. Then would say "repair connection" and wouldn't list itself in the bluetooth option in the app. When that happens I have to go to settings and manually connect the bluetooth (there are two bluetooth connections the first one is the name you have given the camera and the second one goes DC67W some numbers and after that the word BT you have to connect the second bluetooth connection for the camera to be fully connected).Another reason for 4 stars is the unavailability of Travelapse videos in the Garmin Drive app if you record Travelapse videos you need to physically remove the MicroSD card and transfer them that way.If it wasn't for the issue of fully connecting the camera through Bluetooth and the unavaliability of Travelapse videos through the Drive app this would have been five stars.Update: it now shows Travelapse videos in Drive app. Maybe it's because of the firmware update I installed. But it works now.
1,A total distraction having to use your phone to view
1,Bought this brand new the camera works great when it turns on. The plug that goes into the cigarette lighter does not work I try and plug something else in and it works so I confirmed it is only the one that came with the camera now i have to buy a different one.
1,It’s a pos
1,I could not make the Android "Garmin Drive" app work.  I tried two different Android devices and multiple resets and restarts of all the devices.  The app kept saying "Internet Connection Required" but the internet was working fine on both Android apps.I can't return this item fast enough.
1,I read the reviews and it seemed like a good product but the video constantly freezes it's grainy. Not a fan of it.  Returning it.
1,Description says dash cam includes an sd cardbut none was included.  I used a compatible 32gig sd card and the dash cam’s formatting never finishes.
1,First time using this cam and it seems to stick on the connecting screen for a very long time. I may need to return it. This can't be normal.
1,Purchased the vault storage however nothing is ever saved to it. Only infrequent short (30 min) clips are stored to the SD card. I should have stayed with the 66W which saves video much easier.
1,I wanted to love this but the app makes it unbearable and I’m not a newbie to tech. Love the company just can’t with the app.
1,Does not easily connect to phone. Not dependable. A very expensive non working product
1,Terrible product. Won’t pair with my phone even after going through the troubleshooting steps.
1,False Advertising: Memory card is not included.
1,Had to return device because it would not pair with my iphone.
1,Video quality isn’t good at all. This is a $40 camera at most
1,Incompatible with a Hybrid vehicle paired with Garmin Constant Power.Overall Rating: 🚘/5
1,This camera does not work I was an accident and it did not record at all
1,Wouldn't power from a BMW 12v port. I bought this to use with a rental car and was unable to do so. I wasted my money.
1,Don't rely on this . One of the worst Garmin products out there. Hot and cooks up s.d. cards. Horrible product.
1,Compared to my other dashcams this one does not work as smoothly right out of the box. I don't trust it.
1,the box was received and the product in the box was missing.
3,As a small basic dash cam you keep running for that just in case scenario this is a 5-star product.  Unfortunately what lets the Garmin dash cam line down is the Garmin Drive App. Before the last update connecting and viewing your dash cam video was sketchy at best. After the last Android update there is NO connectivity. I have to pull the memory card out and use a computer to view anything. As a long time Automotive GPS and Garmin watch owner I have to admit I could not suggest the Garmin Dashcam line to anyone.
4,Easy to install and operate. And love the small discrete size. However it's very difficult to read license plates
1,Horrible App experience. The customer support (Kari) didn’t helpme. By by.
5,Video quality is nice and the phone connection works when I want to see the screen.  I do miss having the screen to ensure the camera is pointed in the right direction though.  However with its size I was able to put it behind my mirror so there is less of a chance of it being knocked around.Sound queues it gives off work well.  So far so good.I did hardwire it with the (overpriced) garmin wiring kit.
3,The Garmin Dash Cam 67W has the same 1440p video resolution as the Dash Cam 57 but a much wider field of view. I assumed that the wider view would be a positive and that by purchasing the most expensive product I would receive the best video quality. But of course this is not true since with the wider view you have far more content to display but with the same resolution you have the same number of pixels to work with. Accordingly the cheaper Dash Cam 57 has dramatically better video quality than this 67W. You will be able to read license plates with the 57 but not with this 67W.I recommend you purchase the Garmin Dash Cam 57 instead of the 67W. Even the much cheaper 1080p Dash Cam 47 appears to produce clearer videos than the 67W. Search for comparison videos before making your purchase if you don't believe me.
5,Had this little thing for over a year now. Zero problems and the iPhone app is very easy to use.Love how small and discrete this is.
1,I have never been able to sync this thing with the app. I have tried everything on their troubleshooting guide. Not worth the countless time wasted on this!
1,It only recorded 40 mins of a 2.5 hour trip and of course it did not record the semi that cut me off. Utter trash. I expected more from Garmin.
1,I have been waiting for this item to post so I can return
1,I wanted to like this - I really did!  But it would not connect to my iPhone 13 ( with the latest ios) and apparently this is a known problem (look online...many different boards ...)Disappointing - Garmin is a trusted name and this was a huge let down.
1,Motorcycle crash in front of me. Went to check footage nothing there. Just 10 minutes of me parallel parking an hour earlier. Only records intermittently based on cell signal.  No way to know if it's recording. When you need it most it fails. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1,Recently had a collision but pulled the memory chip to view them.  Not a single thing!  Very upset.  Useless.It is good at taking pictures when you push it and for random driving.  Totally useless investment.
2,First off... I didn't buy mine through Amazon. I got it from Best Buy but that doesn't matter. I like the size of the camera the ease of setup and the app. But the battery only lasts about 30 minutes without external power. That's useless. How are you supposed to use the parking monitor feature with a battery that died hours ago? And it doesn't seem to be able to format new SD cards. I wanted more than the silly 16 GB it comes with so I got a 512 GB class 10 card... and it won't work. After software upgrades it won't work. So if you want something that has to be constantly plugged in and has useless memory capabilities... got to the manufacturer. They'll give you something awful but at least they'll install it and maybe add some power.
1,This camera sat in the windshield for 2 months and won’t turn back on…..wow
1,Using three different android devices only an ancient Galaxy Tab S2 can connect to it at all. That at least got the firmware update. None of my android 12 devices can connect at all and the tab connection is a joke constantly dropping. This product is an embarrassment. I have never had so much trouble getting something so simple to work but Garmin found a way to screw this thing up in every possible aspect. From the annoying beep to the constant connection issues this thing is at best a proof of concept not ready for prome time. At this rate wait for the Mini 37 before there's any hope they get it right. I hope I can find the box to send this garbage back for a refund. What a joke.This is probably the most maddening and frustrating product experience I have had in a couple years. To think Garmin was once a respected name only to ship something so clearly and obviously flawed and not ready for prime time.Only by this if you're interested in paying for the privilege of being a Garmin beta (alpha?) tester.
5,This is for the Mini 2. It's easy to install in a Volvo. Thread everything through and plug it into the usb slot. Volvo even has a little ledge to keep the wire out of the way. I have no complaints. It works well and I do not find the startup beep to be as loud or as annoying as others claim. I don't want to patch it into my electrical with the parking wire so the only annoying part is unplugging it to avoid useless battery drain and remembering to plug it in. But I think that's a minor inconvenience.
1,Brand new Garmin Dash Cam 67 Stuck on Parking GuardApp is useless Paul Tech Support NO HELP! RETURN TO STORE! HA! OKAY PAUL WILL DO!!
2,When it worked the picture quality was great and did not have a single issue. Few months later an update was required after the update it never worked again. I tried all the troubleshooting but nothing worked and of course it’s too late to return it.
1,I was unable to pair the camera with an iPhone using the Garmin Drive software. I tried for over 1.5 hours with 2 different iPhones with 2 different iOS versions using every troubleshooting suggestion on Garmin’s website and on the app with no success. There is a Reddit discussing this problem which is not unique to me. The Garmin Drive app needs to be updated to work with the Mini 2 - if you have an iPhone I suggest not buying this camera until they’ve fixed the problem.
1,Do not buy this I sent mine back and they replaced it with a refurbished model that did the same thing. If it sits in the sun for a few hours it will not turn on will overheat super easy. Kind of useless when it won’t turn on from just being in the car. I live in Denver so not excessive heat.
3,It works good when I finally get it to sync with my phone but I have to re do it every time I turn off the car and back in. It’s a pain. Love that is small but man it a glitchy/cranky app. I was planning to buy a second one for the back of the car but just to get this one to work is a pain of continuing to re load.  It forgets my settings every single time.
1,This thing wouldn't connect/sync with it's own app or show up as a bluetooth device  and the customer service reps seemed annoyed and/or clueless as to how to help. I tried just about every solution I could find but no progress. These things shouldn't have to depend on wonky apps & unreliable bluetooth just to function when it could be set up via a direct connection with a computer.
5,I don't review items often when they work well.  This is an exception.  The Garmin Mini 2 dash cam is the near perfect and most likely the best answer for me in my chrysler 2012 town and country.  Small size and practical operation with  the features I desire. I was able to route the cable so that none of it is seen.  I'm lucky with my van in that there is a USB power connection in my glove box which I used for extremely easy cable routing.  Day and night vision are both good with full view left to right.  My only suggestion at this point is that the red LED light that is always on when recording could be dimmed at night to 10% of current brightness.  Iphone App of Garmin connect is practical and useful.  I am not using any cloud services at this point.  To view recordings I remove the micro SD card and put in my PC.  The "save" button on the camera for desired videos to save in a different folder is a good idea easy to do and not distracting when used.  I don't need or desire a screen on my dash cam.  I do like the automatic correct date and time stamp on all recorded videos.  I am so happy with this unit that I am considering an additional rear facing camera.  It has only been a day so far so I will see how the unit does after months of practical use and Southern California heat.
5,This dash cam works great very small clear vision out front of car with wide lens view. The only problem was getting it to work the WiFi between phone and unit . But that could of been me not setting it up right. And no Instructions how to go online please directions to figure out how to install and program the car put something in the box more than a piece of paper with nothing on it. After using it for 2 weeks I see to look at video while in car you need a good wifi Signal. And download video to iPhone.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love it. Exactly what I was looking for.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Smaller than what I expectedvideo’s quality is just oknot very cleareven cannot see the other car’s license plate!Not worth the money over two hundred.
5,This dash cam is built with good quality
5,Compact and easy to install
4,This is a nice camera.  Displays gps time date and speed.  Should have gotten one a long time ago
4,Works as intended. I Gave as gift person loved it.
5,Hides well out of the way with a great view. Very easy set up and install
1,its extremely hard to set up
5,The replaced my Nextbase 522. No issues so far where as the nextbase always had issues and needed constant maintenance. wish it had the option to add a rear camera. A little noisy (loads of alerts) but I’m starting appreciate them/zone them out.
4,Ford decided for your safety can't use pickup bed view cam while moving. Mounted this inside the back window. Using live view thru Garmin Drive app on phone I can see what's going on behind me and cargo in bed. Pic quality is OK connecting is spotty no settings to flip the view (Right is on left Left is Right) recording is turned off when in LiveView.
4,I have a lot of Garmin products and have been satisfied with all. Camera would be 5 star but for a rattle when at highway speed. Must be electronic since it is secure to the windshield
4,I live in Texas where roads are horrible. I had to turn off the sensitivity. I'm also thinking the voice controls may not work. It supposed to give you an audio response after ok garmin so you know it's ready for a command. No matter how loud I say it it does not work. Going to give it one more try and may have to return as defective.
1,bought this camera to be able to connect remotely for when my son drives by himself WELL this was a very disappointing 3 days of setup. first in order to pari it you have to try like 6 times until it finds the camera I tried iphone 10 12 13 and android. then after the 5-6 times i tried and connect you need to buy their subscription in order to access it remotely. thats what is says on the website. there is no way to access this camera remotely as advertised. so brings me to the point just buy any camera that does the same thing for cheaper because in order for this camera to be connected to the vault and remotely you need to have hotspot which it never finds. i am very disappointed that i wasted my time wiring this on my car pay a subscription fee and hustling to connect this on every use.
5,Easy to install.  Replaced another brand that did not record when needed.  Small but packed full of features.
5,I have used dash cams off and on all from Amazon that have good reviews. But none have lasted very long. Recently I have had a few close calls with aggressive drivers but I’ve always had an interest in just being able to replay things I see driving. So I decided to try a Garmin one and hope for some more longevity.The mount it comes with seemed sketchy at first but I actually like it better than the big suction cups. Hopefully this has less issues in high heat or extreme cold. The suction mounts always seems to fall off. I didn’t do the best job with placement initially and I had to get creative with the adhesive metal disc jobies for the magnet to mount to. I actually just used a washer and some Scotch Mounting Tape so I could temporarily test it in more positions but it might actually be a long term solutions. I was able to clean up the metal discs it came with with Goo Gone and apply new Scotch Mounting tape but those are in back up for now.The user interface on the device itself benefits from Garmin’s engineering folks. It is fairly self teaching. I almost didn’t need to refer to the manual except to understand the voice controls a little better. Connecting it to my phone was a little odd but I’ve always struggle with IoT devices and connecting to my phone.Crossing my fingers this will be a good longer term accessory.
5,Before buying this one I bought the cheaper dashcams out there that had excellent reviews. They were complete garbage. They were like some cheap knockoff of the real thing. The menus were terrible and functions did not work properly on the cheap ones. I threw them away. Junk.I have been using Garmin GPS devices since they first came out with them. They are a large company that makes quality products. When I found the Garmin 67W and 57 I had to get them both for my cars.PROS:1. I really like the mounting method of a small magnetic mount that can get easily detached by just pulling it off.2. The collision avoidance warning is fantastic. It warns me when I am getting too close to the car in front and can give a visual and audible alarm.3. Lane departure warning is also pretty good. When I am on the freeway it alerts me when I drift from the lane.4. It has a very clear lens.5. Super clear video and simple and intuitive functions.6. Red light camera warning works great too.7. It alerts you when traffic is moving again.8. Runs on battery so I don't always have to use the wire.CONS:1. The only con for me is that since this is so small playing back from the device is small too.SUMMARYI love the 67W and the 57 they are both fantastic and work great.
5,Exactly as advertised!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Best value for the money features and brand reliability.  Read ahead and watch my video for how to hardwire this unit without any splicing.I’ve learned the hard way not to buy electronics from brands you’ve never heard of.  When a company doesn’t have a reputation it doesn’t have any obligation or impetus to live up to it.  Don’t spend this kind of money on a product from a certain nation that has a general lack of concern for customer satisfaction and long term repeat business.  You’ll just end up with poorly translated software and cheaply made and almost completely untested junk that will not hold up to the excessive temps of a car dash.I’ve also learned that you don’t need screens on EVERY electronic device.  What you need is connectivity to the devices we ALL HAVE our phones.  Screens on dashcams get hot and cold they just break with that stress.  Easier to use an app to interact with it.  Every single dash cam should do this.  Most other brands don’t even have apps at all you have to manually save clips using the screen and their junk software then take the sd card and put it on your computer and manually transfer the files.  Let’s say I witness an accident in front of me.  I hit the save/tag button I connect to the camera with my phone then find the most recent tagged clip download it upload it to google drive or whatever cloud you use and then I can share the link with people in the accident or police.  All in a couple of minutes.The only time that you’d possibly need a screen is if you are a taxi driver who wants people to recognize they are being recorded and so behave themselves.This unit’s only downside really is that it is not 4k.  4K could come in handy trying to grab a plate so I hope to see this feature in future models.  That why I have not given this five stars.The software is easy enough to use with the Garmin Drive app.  Just power up and use the app to connect to the cam using Wi-Fi like you would setting up a smart device.  This does take10-30 seconds every time you want to adjust settings or save and download a clip but you aren’t going to be doing that very often.You can also connect this cam to Wi-Fi networks for quicker connection and to back up clips to the cloud.  Garmin offers a subscription service that I don’t think is necessary for most drivers unless you have to document everything for some reason.  But if you do need it you’ll need a hotspot on your car or phone or have Wi-Fi connectivity wherever you park the vehicle to upload files to the cloud.Unlike home security where you might not know for days you need to look at something they may have been recorded and so need the cloud services those companies offer you’ll either be driving when something happens or you’ll see it within a few hours after it’s vandalized or whatever.  No need for cloud on this device.The device has two buttons one to save whatever it is currently recording and the other to toggle on/off audio recording.  The save button is handy as it automatically moves files into the saved category so you don’t have to hunt through hours of clips for what you’re looking for.  The device has a gyroscope whose sensitivity you can set in the settings.  Hitting a pothole for example will trigger the auto-save function where it will automatically move what was recorded during that detected bump to the saved files.Now it saves everything you do until it needs to wipe older clips to make way for new ones but the saved button and any impact sensed files are never gonna be deleted unless manually.  So no way to accidentally lose a file you’ve tagged or the cam tagged for you.The device also has two lights which indicate powering up (green) and recording (red/orange) as well as other colors reflecting various functions like an impact or you hit the save button.  And others for various malfunctions all listed online and in your manual.I can see those lights being annoying at night but my device is behind my mirror so I can’t see them.  Update: Lights are not bothersome.Since this device is 1080p a 32gb $8 Micro SD card is all you need.  That’s many hours of video no need to spend more on larger.Now for the install you don’t need any of the cables that come with this unit or the separately purchased Garmin hardwire kit.  All you need is an OBS-2 micro usb cable for around $10.  You plug that into your OBS port run the cable under the dash panel pull out your outer door seal (they are not glued just pushed into place) and push the wire in between the aluminum outer panels and dash panels up the a-pillar then under the edge of the headliner to the desired set up spot.  Push your seal back in and you’re good to go.I recommend putting the cam behind the mirror to obscure its distracting lights and hide it from view.  Additionally I put the connection to the windshield on part of the windshield blackened out to reduce sun glare above the mirror for the driver.  That way to reduce potential sign damage.The OBS-2 is the superior system for many reasons.  The cable has a a switch that allows you to toggle between always on and only on when the vehicle is on.  Most USB ports on cars are only on when the car is making your cams parking features useless.  Some have one always on port but what if you don’t use your car all weekend you drain the battery so must remember to unplug it.  Then there is having the cables all around your center console even if you tuck them behind panels and the headliner they still have to plug in and clutter the console and look sloppy.  This is why so many people recommend hardwiring but then that is either always on or always off.  Same issues but even more difficult and risky install.  Usually have to pay a professional.  This OSB solution addresses all of that and is cheaper.  It allows you to flip a switch if you want it to say record while you’re in the grocery store or at work and then switch it off to preserve its battery when the vehicle is home in the garage.Finally this Garmin Mini 2 has my favorite attachment system.  It’s a metal frame with a ball joint that your camera will simply snap into.  That frame attaches to your windshield with an adhesive.  This is the best because it uses no plastic or suction cups.  Those things deteriorate under UV light so every time your car is under the sun those parts are warping.  I’ve had more than one other brand cam fall apart this way.  Garmin’s adhesive and metal frame is the most reliable system and I have no doubt it will last the length of my vehicle.I’ve attached a few shots of how small and discrete the Garmin Mini 2 can be and how I hardwire installed it with the OBS-2 cable.
5,easy installation and set up picture quality is outstanding and clear the lane depart feature works well as well as the forward collision warning. bought 2 one for each vehicle.
4,I really want to like this dash cam. I am able to hide it behind the mirror but the picture quality not so good. 1080p is what you get. Can't even read the license plate during day time.
5,Very small camera but it works perfect the quality is good on the videos and it’s very easy to install and use the app
5,The camera appears to be high quality. Love the travelapse feature. Very slow to connect. Vault only seems to hold 30 seconds worth of video without a subscription
5,This one is a 1440p verson of the garmin dashcam series which is a very small.  I like it because the mount is just a magnetic base so it's easy to pull off whenever you want.  This base though is a black plastic and after a year in the sun tend to break (plastic cracks) so stock up on these bases  about 10 bucks each.  Sometimes i stick some supergule in there so if it cracks ifs still together. The dashcam has most of the features as any ofther forward looking dashcam.  can warn you if your are going out of your lane  car in front moved away  something bumped car  it detects movement and will start recording in parked mode if you hook up the power cable.  It does have a bluetooth app for your phone to watch videos off unit.  I still dont feel like it's the best way to copy video files off the dashcam but it works.  I do have the hardwire kit and it is very stealthy  hard to see until up close depending on where you mounted it.  This one can record sound  it can do trip time lapse videos as well.  it can use a huge 512gb memory stick so it can hold a lot.  My old dashcam was 64gb so i'm thinking it can hold at least a few months worth of videos?  Anyways durable and reliable.  Night videos are pretty clear as well.  If you are a speeder and red light runner maybe you dont want this as it can record videos of you running a red light with speed and location  lol.  Otherwise get one!
4,Everything is great except the app. To be clear it works perfectly fine. It's just confusing and lacks documentation.First of all certain functions in the Drive app requires you to connect to the unit's wifi which is not connected to the internet even when the unit itself has internet access through your home wifi. The whole vault concept is also weird. You have to first "save" the clip. The usual clip is 15 min long click export and the clip should now be permanently saved in the sd card you can also click save video in the app or use voice command to get a 30 sec long clip inclusing 15 seconds before and after the moment say the voice command which makes sense but there's no documentation. After you do this the clips will be in the saved instead of temporary section and will be uploaded to the vault automatically but I'm not sure if it's uploaded from your phone's storage or from the camera's storage because the app says upload to vault requires an active internet connection on your phone which the unit's wifi doesn't provide. Yet everything else seems to suggest the clip is uploaded from the cam's storage.Anyway there's just many small and weird details about the whole system and there's no documentation I consider myself very tech-savvy and it still took me a solid one hour to figure these stuff out no wonder there's so many complaints about how the app doesn't work the truth is it does but no one's gonna tell you how to use it.
5,After ten years with my old Mini 0801 Dash Cam it quit working.  This was a similarly priced alternative that doesn't have some of the features of the old camera (GPS On screen speed and location) but has features such as voice commands that the 0801 doesn't have overall a win!  Being this is a Garmin product I'm confident that it will be more reliable that the 0801 but time will tell.
5,I have trouble with the suction mount falling off windshield could possibly be due to extreme temperature changes the disk that mounts to window for magnetic mount works great.
5,These work fine. The new features work fine and we are happy with the display and performance. We appreciate that these come with memory. We ordered larger memories to store longer periods of time without writing over older video.
1,I've had it less then 90 days. I called garmin for support. They can't fix it. I called Amazon. They tell me I have to talk to the seller and the seller says I need to call Amazon. So I screwed.
4,it has some functionality things. The quality is not an issue with this but the app could be a bit better. Get a big SD card if you actually want to be able to review any marginally sized mass recording. I would spend the extra $30 for the 67w especially if you have a big cab. I have an average sedan and it just barely reaches the bottom of the a frame so a 180 degree lens would be perfect.
5,Definitely purchase the power adapter if you have a power rear view mirror! Very easy to use and it does not obstruct view at all!
5,I've tried couple cams before buying this one it's very quality and has excellent picture quality
4,The basic: Video recording is good. It records automatically when the engine starts and it stops recording when the engine stops. It can connect to a wifi so that it can upload the recordings before shutting down but that seems to work only with short videos so this feature is useless. The connectivity between the phone to the camera is very slow it takes about 5 minutes to transfer a 10 minutes footage. Bottom line: it keeps the videos in the SD card and if needed you can access them by attaching the SD to a computer. That’s all that matters. Regarding the app: poor UI & not intuitive interface. Not easy if you’re not a tech person.
5,Works as advertised.
5,Small compact with wide view. This is very easy to use. READ the instructions for set up of sounds time-out and notifications & you’ll be extremely happy. It has a collision & proximity warning/notification and a display time-out that was frustrating to me but you can change it all in the settings. When you want to save a video just easily say “Garmin save video”I love this dash cam so much I bought my husband the dash 57!
5,I love this dash cam. It's very small so it does not obstruct your view in any way. You can easily put this in front of your rearview mirror and forget you even have it. I also like this it does not have a screen. If I need to playback a video I can just use my phone. And the removal of the screen greatly reduces the size this thing needs to be. The app is really nice and super easy to use. I was a little nervous because I read reviews from about a year ago where people had problems with the app connecting to their device. I am using an Android phone and have had no problems. Looks like Garmin fixed all the bugs in the apps. The image it takes is really nice and it automatically dates and timestamps the video (which you can turn off in the options if you want). I have not tried this dashcam at night yet. I had previously tried a Kingslim dashcam prior to trying this Garmin and I immediately returned the Kingslim (their app was horrible). The Garmin is 100 times better. Would buy it again.
5,Small enough to put behind review mirror.
5,This is my second Garmin Dash cam they are great and I love the feature that you can download your videos right to your phone without having to connect to a computer
5,Install was simple works well!  Video playback is very good and clear!  Good purchase!
4,Nice upgrade from the original mini.  Haven’t had it long my original Garmin mini stopped connected to Wi-Fi out of the blue.  Out of warranty and would have been 90$ to replace per Garmin customer service.  So I just bought the mini 2.  I like the voice controls although there aren’t many.  This one actually works.  The fish eye and glare are a bit annoying compared to the older model.
5,Easy to install and setup. Good picture and audio quality. Keeps your video saved on their version of the cloud for 24 hours (you can subscribe to more time if needed) and it's easy to find crop and save the video portion to your phone. It's nothing fancy but it's perfect for what I need and made by a reputable company.
3,Seems to be causing dropouts on my Subaru sound system even when the "prioritize audio" option is checked. Tried the constant power cable setup. Couldn't get it to work under any circumstances. Get voltage out of the plug but apparently not enough to power the camera. Going to try the obdi adapter. I've wasted a bunch of money on this so if you're looking for a parking guard maybe try something else or skip the constant power cable at least.(Note: OBD cable seems to work though sound dropouts persist.)
5,I like the small size and ease of use.  Very simple to figure everything out.  Nice video quality.  Easy app to use on phone.  Happy to have it on cross country trip
5,I just love this Dash cam. I just purchased a new car and want a cam. This was easy to install and had very clear and sharp pictures. Perfect size and price
5,Easy to set up.  I like that the camera comes with a SD card but I opted to put a bigger one in.  Set up can be done from camera or the app.  The main feature I wanted is the cloud recording capability and that I don’t have to pay for it.  Garmin does offer a paid plan if you need the additional offerings  but for me I didn’t.  The detection is a bit sensitive when you are driving but it does work well for side and front.  I researched multiple cameras and for the money this had the features quality and picture clarity I was looking for.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Love all of my Garmin products especially the dash cam with the parking kit. Will never go without a dash cam again. Video example of a typical BMW guy blowing through a red light in front of the sheriff! Cut off for voice privacy.
5,Totally love the dash cam. It is loaded with great features like lane departure warnings lane departure and traffic moving.
5,Totally love the dash cam. It is loaded with great features like lane departure warnings lane departure and traffic moving.
5,Great camera. So much smaller than I expected!
2,App is terrible! Unfortunately I have not had a good experience with this one.  It is very difficult to download the videos from the camera as the app crashes all the time.  I have had great luck with my other car dash cam which is a vava.
1,I was envisioning I'm getting a dependable dash cam that would record all the time while driving. I'm not using much any of the additional features outside of voice commands to activate taking photo and travel-lapse.I was expecting that the camera is recording all the time while I'm driving with "delete when full setting" in the app. No. I found the hard way - when I need the footage it's not there. Ok so that is a big issue for a device at this price tag... The footage is not there the SD card is almost empty - so where is it? Nobody knows...I have to go back to a well-proven Anker/Roav brand that I was using for years without any single issue.
5,This camera is small enough to tuck away behind my rearview. Installation took about 30 minutes including moving my existing camera from the front to the rear.  Software paired up nicely. Perhaps not as straight forward as one might wish but I had no trouble getting everything synced up and connected. It did take me a bit to figure out where my videos were stored but really even that was pretty straight forward once I found them (they were unsaved so duh!) Runs well it's easy to configure and the videos are really nice compared to my $40 cameras.  I still have some things to work out like voice activation and I have not tried it at night yet but I will update this review once I have. So far 10/10 - would gladly purchase another one.
5,So we did massive research and decided on this one. We can record audio turn off audio save a video take a picture and start travelapse all voice activated. It nice a small and lightweight and the depth of field is great. We purchased a HD micro card and no issues. We loved it so much we bought a second one. Def worth it. Go get one people!
5,This camera is the right one if you need an inexpensive but quality dash cam. I have had other brands before and have to say this is better than any cheap camera and I find it better than most of the expensive ones too. Highly recommended.
5,Easy to install and the wiring connector is long enough to hide it out of sight there is a problem with the app connecting maybe it’s just me but you can remove the micro card and view it on your computer or tablet you would need a reader and the micro card is not included. The greatest thing about this camera is it’s out of sight and works great with voice commands” ok garmin save video” if you see something that needs to be saved it will save the clip. “Ok Garmin take a photo” it will take a photo. It will not stop back seat driving 😆 I have owned three different cameras this though a bit pricey is the best one for ease of use and installation and it will not drop of the windshield is you hit a bump. It also comes with an extra adhesive mount if you ever need to move it to another vehicle plus a power adapter plugin/ cigarette lighter with two USB ports if your car doesn’t have enough.
5,Clear videos and easy installation and setup
5,Small camera profile means it's not taking up my view. Very easy to set up with the app. Once I figured out how to connect the camera to wifi it was smooth sailing. Picture quality is great but better if you purchase the Garmin polarizing filter.
4,I primarily bought this dash cam because it is small and does not have a display screen in hopes that it would be less visible and appealing to potential thieves.  I mounted it behind my rear-view mirror and was able to easily hide the power cable in the trim of my car without the need for any tools (other than a credit card to help push the included 4m / 13 feet long cable into the trim).  The end result is that it is difficult to see from outside the car unless you are looking for it.  At a distance light reflection off the windshield makes it very difficult to notice especially when it blends into my black rear view mirror.The package includes the dash cam two cables (one thin 13 ft cable used to hide in the trim one shorter 5 ft cable to run straight down to your USB port - both are Micro USB to USB-A cables) two adhesive mounts (1 is a spare) and one dual USB car charger that outputs 5VDC at 2.4A total to allow you to plug both your Dash Cam and phone in simultaneously.  A MicroSDHC or MicroSDXC is required to record videos but is not included.Video quality is good (1080p 30fps HDR 2.1 MP 140 deg viewing angle) but don't expect to be able to easily read license plates.  I had difficulty reading license plates with the camera when stopped 1.5 car lengths back in daylight even though it was clear to the naked eye.  My tip is to park behind another car and switch to live view with your phone and adjust your camera angle until you can read the license plate.  This unit would be better if it were 4K.Voice control is excellent and extremely responsive.  I was able to say "OK Garmin save video" or "take a picture" without any problems even when I had music playing and was driving on the highway.  It was never confused when I voice controlled my phone ("OK google").  While you can also press a button to manually initiate a video recording voice control is extremely convenient to capture a picture or event without removing your hands from the wheel.The dash cam turns on quickly when you turn on your car and beeps when recording starts (there is also a red light at the bottom indicating it is recording).  You can choose to have audio on or off.  It records consistently and does its job.  It also beeps to confirm when a video or photo is saved.  It also automatically saves videos in the case of an incident (accident).  In the last 2 weeks I had two false incidents recorded (one I hit a small bump in the road the other I was actually stationary) but false incident detections appear rare and aren't a big deal anyway.  Incidents or manual recordings are saved permanently until you delete them while all other videos of your normal driving are automatically replaced when you run out of storage space.It does not have a built in battery so it does not record video when you turn off your car.  If you want to use the Parking Guard feature to detect incidents when the car is off you need to purchase a Constant Power Cable to connect it to your OBD II port (not your USB port).The Garmin Drive App works to view pictures and videos and to change settings.  This only works when the dash cam is powered (which means your car is on).  You can connect to the dash cam using bluetooth to see previews of the stored images but cannot view the actual pictures or videos unless you connect to it through WiFi.  Unfortunately connecting to the dash cam through WiFi is a very poor experience.  It is extremely slow to connect and does not always connect.  It is also a slow process to download the videos to your phone.  The main problem is most people check their videos when they get home.  At that point your phone usually connects to your home or work WiFi automatically.  It appears this can at times conflict with connecting to your Dash Cam through WiFi.  As you can only view videos and pictures when connected through WiFi this is a problem.  Hopefully they fix this in future updates to the app.  Fortunately you don't need to connect to your Dash Cam every day only when you need to see a video.  In many ways it is easier to just pop out your microSD card and manually copy the videos to your computer.The Garmin Vault feature is a nice concept (storing your videos on the cloud) but from a practical standpoint isn't useful because you need to manually send each video to the cloud which is a slow process (you need to use the Garmin Drive App).  It also only stays in the vault for 1 day unless you pay more.  This would work better if it had a small battery and allowed for background uploading of videos to the cloud while your car is off.Conclusion:This is an excellent dash cam in terms of its primary job of consistently recording high quality videos and functioning as it should.  It has excellent voice control and its small size makes it less visible to potential thieves.  Where it loses points is the connectivity issues with the Garmin Drive App to view the videos.Overall I am happy with my purchase but would be happier if it were 4K if the Garmin Drive App connected consistently and were faster and if a battery were built in.
4,I was at the edge of returning this camera because I was having issues connecting to the camera with my iphone.  The Garmin app was not showing any accessory to select in order to finalize the setup so I kept clicking the cancel button and restarting the setup (very frustrating).  After some investigation on Garmin’s troubleshooting information I noticed that the app can take up to two minutes before actually showing the camera on the selection menu.  Therefore instead of clicking cancel after a while I decided to wait a lot more and sure enough the camera did finally show up and I was able to finalize the setup.  The camera is simple compact & I like the voice control to save a picture or video.  The picture quality is not the best but its small size is a big factor for me.  The access to videos via the app is not the fastest but its fast enough for me.  Overall a great camera for the price and size.
3,J’ai acheté Dash Cam mini 2 et Dash Cam 66W et  synchronisée sur DRIVE  : beaucoup de bugs de déconnexion impossibilité de mettre à jour etc….. connexion wifi et connexion Bluetooth compliquée  je déconseille fortement  ☹️☹️
1,The camera has a great quality but to make it as a rear camera I can’t even connect to it from the app becuase of the distance even if my car is a short vehicle. Very bad connection so it is very very hard to access the videos from the front seat. Not recommended if you already have other garming camera for the front just stick to it… This is more problem than a tool for me.
1,After reading raving reviews bought this camera. Linking to your phone is a nightmare. Saving video is a nightmare. The “event” setting captures everything EXCEPT the actual event. After an incident I tired for 1 hour to transfer video only to find the trip was unsaved and not downloadable. Absolutely a waste of money
1,Encontrar memoria compatible es un problema.
1,No funciona. Problemas con connection. Lastima. La calidad de Garmin es muy malo.
4,No entiendo de que se quejan las otras reseñas talvez no hicieron bien la instalación o conexión. La conexión bluetooth a la aplicación me funciona sin ningún problema la memoria funciona con cualquier micro SD de los últimos 10 años y la calidad de video nocturno es mejor de lo que esperaba por el tamaño del sensor. También me parece excelente el pequeño tamaño de la cámara ya que no obstruye la visión llama menos la atención para evitar robos y quita la pantalla que es totalmente innecesaria.Ahora las desventajas aún sacando el video directo de la micro SD el video tiene compresión significativa es considerablemente difícil distinguir las placas de un coche que vaya pasando una de las principales razones de instalar una DashCam es para esto. Estoy casi seguro de que esto se puede arreglar con una actualización que permita guardar video con menos compresión pero dudo que lo hagan porque ya lleva mucho tiempo en el mercado y no lo han hecho. Lo segundo es que no incluye el filtro polarizado y cuesta unos $500 pesos extra si esta diseñado para ir montado en el carro esto debería estar incluido por el precio ya que el reflejo del tablero se ve demasiado.
2,mala calidad problemas con conexcion a celular
4,Its very small. I also purchased the polarized lens that helps a lot. It cuts out a lot of glare. The lens should really be built into the unit and not an additional fee.  The video quality is acceptable in daytime. I'm able to get plates in the daylight. Plates are washed out at night and not really legible. Its good enough for insurance purposes. I caught 2 accidents so far (3 months) and many many near misses.The voice commands work ok. The app has been a horrible experience. Garmin drive app. Taking out the card to a computer is much less infuriating then using the Garmin drive app.Ignorant drivers beware you will end up on YouTube!
1,This dash cam requires the Garmin drive app to work. I cannot log in to the drive app because of a web view error. Tried two devices with different versions of android. So the dash cam is useless because of a garmin app error. Would give it zero stars if I could.
3,Returned as I had hoped to use as monitor as vandalism has been problem.. needing wifi all the time limits for me
5,Good
5,small simple dash cam that works for what i need it to. Hard to read license plates but otherwise picture quality is good. Night time PQ is a bit grainy
2,Third Garmin dashcam over 5 years. Prior ones got very hot with the 55 failing out of warranty.  This Mini 2 was an affordable replacement but being sent back after 24 hours and 2 support calls without resolution of problems: 1) time stamp wrong and 2) identifies the wrong dashcam model during a firmware update. "Never seen this before" and advised return. Installation directions not the best. App has an outdated feel Windows 95 feel and slow to give a live feed. I like supporting Garmin but prolly have to consider switching brand.
5,Exactly as advertised.  Quick delivery.  Very happy with product so far
1,Après près de 1 mois d utilisation  ne fonctionne déjà plus
4,I love how small this dashcam is. The quality is great app works well. Haven't had any issues in the months that I've had it.
5,Súper práctica y comoda
5,I bought this camera after researching several cameras I choose this one after watching a review by Brian greenstone on youtube. Its a great size the quality is pretty good but ive only been using it for a week I intend to buy the polarized filter. Set up and install was very quick. Its done a great job automatically saving incident videos. I would recommend it to others.
1,The camera is not reliable sometimes does not work while. highly do not recommend it
4,I haven't fat any issues. Is it the best dash cam out there? Nope. But it does the job. Good value for what I need. Set up in 15 min if you know what are you doing 😁
5,Perfect solution for those who want discretion with their dashcams. Takes barely any windshield  room at all.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought this for the first time last week.The first time a firmware update was wasn't in on it it was bricked. The lights would not stop flashing green. It couldn't pair. Even removing the SD card wouldn't get it to flash yellow. Returned to Amazon.Ordered a replacement. Out of box this is the immediate experience. It will not pair. It is stuck in a missing SD card boot loop in or out of car.I can't believe the Garmin brand is associated with such garbage. Will be emailing the Wirecutter to ask them to remove from their list of suggested dash cams.2 in a row is too often.
5,si no quieres  tener un cablerio sobre tu tablero necesitas esconder el clave y eso es lo incómodo para instalarla. El utilizarla es relativamente fácil y como es mini se esconde muy bien detrás de espejo retrovisor. la calidad de imagen es buena pero detalles pequeños como números de placa son muy difícil de distinguir.
5,I love this little dash cam. Pic quality is so good with coloured night vision and App is working perfectly as well
1,Cannot store onto vault even with a paid subscription. Don’t waste your money.
5,Good and quality product from Garmin dash cam series. It does the job but don't expect too much out of it.Nice low profile and one of the smallest dash cams on the market. If you are looking for a better quality cam with GPS choose one of it's siblings
1,Pros:-small sizeCons:-wifi rarely connects-reboots randomly...a lot-sometimes it just wont boot when car starts-unresponsive Garmin support-no warranty-unreliableFirst and last Garmin product I have bought. Total junk. Bought it 2 months ago and now have to throw it out and buy another dashcam.
5,Super
5,Excellent product
1,Prepare to keep pairing the camera or repair the connection. Multiple times a day. Support is useless. Get other brands to save time and money. NOT WORTH IT.
4,We really enjoy this dashcam because how easy it was to setup as well how easy it was to retrieve a video or photo within seconds.We have our to setup with the voice command “okay dashcam” with follow up words like “save video”. Works great when it pick your voice up.Pros - absolutely no need for subscription- easy setup- voice commands- road assistance features (speed check lane assistance forward collision with sensitivity adjustments)- Good quality with quick access to download on your phone (1080p)- Comes with a free 16g of storageCons- App needs a whole re design ( when prompt with “join wifi” you don’t actually need to be on wifi just click it with your data service)
5,A good quality dashcam without all the bells and whistles. Does what you need it to without all the glitter.
1,The 1-1/2 hours I have wasted tried trying to sign in to the Garmin app are worth more than I spent on the dashcam.  Fix your app.
5,Compact n does the job but wish garmin included  a removable suction mount holder instead of another mount with semi permanent double sided tape to attach to windscreen- for obvious rental car reasons. Connect with the long cable to be able to use iphone for live view etc.
4,Bueno: es muy discreta pequeña y la imagen es clara.Malo: se calienta mucho y aún más en climas cálidos
5,Like it
5,Got the first one for the mini cooper we own liked the small size. The app is ok little flakey at connecting sometimes. But it works. Just picketed up a second on for my dad's birthday
