3,Pre script -- If all you want this thing for is to store and access files it's fine. Skip this review. But if you want to TRY to use it as a media server I think you better read this. I think it's a fair review but it's detailed to explain (most of) what I've encountered. It isn't pretty. But I think you might want to pay out for something better. Here's why. . .March 3 2022Let me start by saying first that in principle I really like this device. It's beautifully designed and relatively easy to setup and use. And if the WD world was perfect then this would be a five-star review without question. However as you might have noted with the title of this review the whole point of having a home NAS is so that you can have a trusted reliable backup and access of your files. That's where this thing begins to break down in my opinion. I am at present in Spain visiting my son for a month. Into the second week the access to my MyCloud Home failed. I could provide you with excruciating specific details but I'll spare you. Instead of a deep dive we'll just do a short dip. Deal?The built-in software requires you to create an account on the WD network. Anything that you access from your NAS goes from the device out to the Internet through your account via their database and network and back from them to you over whatever device you are using to access your files--be it your computer phone etc. Since owning this NAS from January 2021 I have suffered from two significant failures due to this system and method of access.First if you are creating hyperlinks to share access to a file (pretty much like you would for Dropbox for example) you have to click on the file in the WD interface and copy a 'share link' that they generate to your clipboard. Then you can paste that hyperlink into an email for example. Or as I use it on a digital online bulletin board to which I give family and friends access. But Western Digital's link generating system was down for many hours once and it took me forever to troubleshoot that the problem was with their servers and not really with my NAS hardware. This chat support rep I was working with didn't even know what was going on and their automated server monitoring system that you can see online didn't flag the problem but should have. Finally the chat person had me hold for a long time came back and told me that it was indeed their servers that were failing to generate the links. This happened several months ago never to be repeated. But it underscores the inherent problem with relying on the WD network for utilitarian functions that should just be between you and your device if you get what I mean. So there's that.Anyway back to the matter in Spain. I did some research on Google and found out that this is a common enough problem that folks have posted it on forums. You can't access your own NAS files through their network. You can't log onto your own device. And then when you give the secret code that's on the bottom of the box (It's a 9-digit Alpha code that the WD login dialogue asks you for to find your NAS like "QXF-5RR-GBS") the login system comes back and tells you that you need to 'ask the owner to send an invitation to your email.' That's bonkers because I'M the owner!They tell you that the box can drop the first registered account in favor of one of the other accounts. (That's a bug they never warned me about prior to purchasing the device. Now YOU are warned!) The big problem in my case is that I was the ONLY account that was created without any secondary accounts associated with the NAS for it to fall back onto; and now they've acted like I'm simply S.O.L. with all my data. So as soon as I get home I'm going to try and figure out how to access the data like you would on just a hard drive and offload it to another drive. I'm hoping that works. But treachery is defined as "betrayal of trust; deceptive action or nature." Pretty much describes this MyCloud Home NAS situation. My advice is that if you DO decide to purchase one of these (which I totally understand if you do) MAKE SURE that you create one or more secondary accounts so that if it drops the owner account it will default down to one of the others and you can still access your stuff. That's going to be my plan moving forward if I can actually recover from this.So that's about the size of it. But my greatest disappointment is with the WD support. Their availability and follow up are pretty good. I mean they stayed with me on chat for a long time while I obtained the S/N and other numbers remotely from back home over the phone with my wife in Florida and they waited patiently while rebooting etc. But in the end they really offered no hope as the technical issue seemed to finally fall outside the gamut of their mindless support script. I was expecting a follow up contact email with the solution once I provided the debug files but it's been weeks now and my email is dead silent. So there it is folks.Once I return home and get my hands on this box I'll follow up this review with an update. (Maybe it's not as bad as I think it is.) But right now I'm watching Catalonian TV and unable to access any of my own entertainment from home--right when I need it most. Disappointed!! Well at least I have Amazon Prime Video right?UPDATE (As promised):March 27 2022Ok. Here's the lowdown. . . Once home I kept trying to log onto the device through my WD account. Nope. It was exactly as it was from Spain. So I got on YouTube and watched every relevant video until I understood what was under the hood. The problem with those videos is that there are four clips they warn you about that's holding the two halves together (once you remove the four screws under the two rubber feet) but they don't show you EXACTLY where to find them. There are four white guide studs that LOOK like they could be the clips but they are only guides. None of the videos were explicit about the locations of the clips or what they looked like and how to depress them and I ended up breaking them all. Once the first one snapped it doesn't matter because now the warrantee is voided. (That's all the clips are for anyway. If you want the warrantee to be in force just don't do what I did--I mean take it apart.)I followed the other videos on tearing down the device. It's not hard but a tad bit tedious. Figure on just taking your time. After finally extracting the 4TB WD Red hard drive I placed it into the Sabrent USB 3.0 SATA Hard Drive Flat Docking Station that I got from Amazon and plugged it into my Windows 10 machine. But you aren't home yet. You have to download a ten-day trial software (Linux File System for Windows by Paragon) that allows you to read files from a hard drive that's formatted in Linux which is what this My Cloud device reads and writes in. You must be very careful not to write to the hard drive; only read the files! They are a pain to find and there are no file extensions. They encode the names with scrambled letters and numbers and decode them within the device. You can go by the file sizes to determine which are videos but picture files are another matter. I renamed each file with the .mp4 extension on my target drive and then watched the beginning of each one to figure out what movie it was. Then I renamed the file to that movie. There's no other way that I could find on the Internets as to how to determine your movie files.Once retrieved you can put your My Cloud Home back together. Fire it up. Factory reset it. And now create a new login to it with your WD profile. I back loaded all the movie files onto the device as if it was a brand new one (which it kind of is). Now it's possible to catalog all your movies again (as if this wasn't enough of a pain already). The way I did it before was to generate a hyperlink for each movie file and then add that to an online bulletin board listing genres and 'cards' under the genre columns that pertain to the type of film it is then listing each and every movie and setting the text for the movie title with each respective hyperlink. Then. . . I discovered what PLEX is and that changed my life.The problem with using PLEX with the WD My Cloud Home is that it can't organize your movies nicely. All you get is one library. ONE. It's not the fault of PLEX. It's the WD My Cloud Home app. It sucks. Be that as it may at present I'm back up and running after all that. And I have a fall-back profile registered on the device just in case it somehow loses my login again! (Lesson Learned). But I'm also backing everything up onto an external 5TB Seagate I got from the big box store.In the future I plan on making my own NAS. I'm actually thinking that I could use the My Cloud as a "slave" NAS to the new "master" NAS that I am planning to make. You can use an old computer and load it with free software called TruNAS. Follow the YouTubes on this. But I'm done with EVER buying a WD NAS again. Too much work for too little benefit. You can't even access your files from it within your OWN HOME NETWORK without the Internet. It's just lame.
5,I am a video editor and I have a lot of raw footage that takes up significant space on my computer phone and cloud servicer drive. After a recommendation I tried this external hard drive with cloud capabilities. Yes you need to upload the files manually however that's a small trade off for the ability to have 1TB of space at your fingertips on the go AND not be tied to another useless subscription.This is so much cheaper than the other cloud services. It also has the ability to connect to other cloud services and transfer files to the hard drive. The interface is useful could be better in terms of ease of use but it works. I love the profiles feature which allows me to separate files between my family of 6.All in all it does what it says its easy to set up and use and I have not had any technical issues thus far. I would recommend this product.
4,This was very easy to install and setup. Basically it did it all for me. I think the software could be a bit more android or IOs like visually. It kinda still has the MS DOS look but it works. The only thing that Id like to see is the ability to upload PDFs from the phone. You can do it no problem from the computer. Actually everything is easier from the computer.. pictures music Document but the Mobil app works fine for uploading pictures and transferring your Google photos from Google cloud.
4,I bought this product thinking I could easily run DLNA without any software like the Seagate externals did.  Instead the DLNA servers require for you to install PLEX or PLayon and those apps tend to be slow and sluggish to operate but at least you can watch movies straight to your TV from this device.  I would have given it a 5 stars but because of the minor inconvenience I give it a 4 stars.  I'll be keeping it and monitoring it's usage daily.
2,I bought the 8 TB My Cloud Home specifically to use as a Plex Media Server.  I have been using the Plex server on an old laptop and really liked the way Plex organizes and serves up my photos music and video files on my network.  But the old laptop is getting well older and will soon be an antique!  The My Cloud Home seemed like a great and elegant solution to run Plex and I could use it for other cloud storage applications as well.The My Cloud home was delivered quickly by Amazon and setup was extremely simple.  I've read some user reviews that complained that you had to have the WD Discovery app open to access the drive and that just wasn't the case for me after initial setup.  It connects to an ethernet RJ45 plug on your router to access the internet and becomes a "cloud" drive.  After setup the drive showed up as a network resource with a drive letter and was super simple to manage within Windows 10.  Some reviewers have noted that it was hard to create your own folders and this too proved to be mistaken.  I setup my folders just like I wanted and started to transfer files.  What those reviewers got right was how LONG it takes to upload your content.  I was getting about 10-13 MB/sec during transfer nothing like typical USB 3.0 speeds.  The My Cloud Home has a USB port in it for file uploads but the speeds were still very slow.After 2 days of uploading my media I was ready to install Plex and see just how wonderful the new system would be.  Plex is installed as a WD app through their online dashboard rather than directly from Plex.  I had to install it twice to get it up and running but once installed it started to recognize and sort my media and bringing in the descriptions and artwork for each item.  Then I fired up Plex on my Roku and started to test everything out.  My connection is on a fast 802.11ac wireless with great signal strength.  Photos came up instantly and I was able to cycle through them with ease.  Next I tried the music files and they played perfectly as well.  With great anticipation I started a 720p movie...and the on screen status froze at 13%.  I let the My Cloud Home crunch on it for a couple of minutes then noticed it had gone offline and was restarting itself.  Hmm.  I made some configuration changes as recommended in the Plex forums and the movie finally played but the playback would stutter and jump skipping about 30 seconds with each jump.  It was unwatchable.  I tried a different HD movie and got the same results if I could even get the movie to play at all.  Next I tried an 480p SD movie and it played just fine.  In fact all of my SD content played fine but the higher resolutions like 720p or 1080p would not (I didn't have any 4K to try).After trying to find a solution and troubleshooting for a week checking my router setting up a static IP making sure the firmware was up to date etc. nothing seemed to work.  Finally I reinstalled by old laptop again just to see if something had failed in my network.  Lo and behold everything worked fine again!  My conclusion from all this trial and error is that the My Cloud Home just doesn't have enough processing horsepower to transcode higher-def videos at least when compared to an 8 year old laptop.  Since my goal was to replace the laptop as a Plex server it just didn't do what the WD description says it will do.  I really wanted to like the My Cloud Home and it offered functionality beyond Plex that was pretty interesting to me.  But in the end it just didn't live up to its promise thus I reluctantly had to send it back.I might try a different Plex server option in the future like a Synology drive or try one of those small NUC computers but for now the old Dell is still working fine.  If you need a solution for cloud storage easy backups and the ability to access and share files remotely then the My Cloud Home could be a great value for you.  But as a Plex Media Server I just can't recommend it.  Sorry...
4,First off others' concerns and complaints are valid; this device has severely limited networkability restricted access without internet very limited configuration options and poorly thought out and implemented features.  It is geared toward consumers who are likely not technically-inclined and just want larger storage to replace or compliment online cloud services. "Integration" with my Windows 10 desktop is limited to the app being able to "map" a single personal folder  to a drive letter.  I can access a single public smb shared folder through the device's local ip address but that folder is not accessible remotely in the cloud and any private user folders are not accessible in normal windows networking.  So far notwithstanding everything I've tried the "included(downloadable)" WD Backup App doesn't see the device and I have found no way through the WD Discovery App to sync or backup anything on my desktop with the device.  My experience with WD Android Apps make me believe backing up from my phone would be much more functional.  I can add users if they have email addresses and internet access but I will have zero control or oversight in what or how much they store. Initial setup was very very simple but I quickly found a long list of limitations.With so many things to complain about why 4 stars?  First it uses WD Red drives. Build quality seems good. It just works with minimal technical knowledge required. As close to plug-and-play as I'd expect something like this to be. Uses the online WD website as a gateway which is much better than punching holes through my router's security. Attractive and easy to use web interface. Good price because mine was one that was used. I took one star away because I really wanted it to be able to automatically sync a few folders from my desktop.A few uncategorized comments: Device only has Raid 1 (mirrored/half tb capacity) or what they call JBOD which is more like internally spanned drive configuration possibly a Raid 0 type setup but who knows. Switching requires a complete wipe of stored files.  Can backup Google Drive if I allow WD App/Device access to my Google Account. Can share files with links for other people to access over internet. Cannot automatically sync local files from desktop pc. Use router DHCP to assign specific local IP if access to Public folder is desired. This Public folder is a non-password-protected Samba network share anyone on LAN has access to.
5,I own a small business and didn’t want to buy cloud services so I purchased my own home cloud and it has been a life saver! You can access from anywhere and it supports all file types. I use it on my Mac and it works really well. Sometimes after an update you may have to login to the WD app for it to recognize but other than that no issues.
3,First off I am returning the product. Yet I give it 3 stars because it may be good for some people - just not for me. In many ways this product is a NAS (I found it searching for a NAS on Amazon) however it really is not. If you are looking for a "cloud server" to access your files anywhere (home and away) for a single payment purchase this product may be for you. It does support something called a "Public Share" which is an SMB enabled disk where you can put and access files local only - much like a NAS would. But it is a very disappointing NAS with abysmal performance. On my Mac with Big Sur you have to connect with CIFS (not SMB; CIFS is the original version on which SMB1 2 and 3 were built on so not the best of protocols to use). Once connected the share gives approximately 1 MB/s write speed and 0.8 MB/s read speed on my Gigabit ethernet. I tried to transfer my movie library to it and it informed me that it will take 7 days to complete (no joke). I transferred one file just for a test (took an hour or two) and then tried to play back on VLC on my computer. Just stutters and stops.The experience using the "Private Share" was not much better. The transfer time was a tad better but still the retrieval speed was not blazing by any means. Movies were still stuttering on my Mac. This may have been because of the CIFS protocol which may be underlying the whole thing I have no idea (they are not very transparent about the private share and how it is accessed; they go for an "it just works" approach which should be good for most consumers I guess). But the killer for me was that the "private share" needs to be authenticated via an internet connection and you cannot access it if you are off-line. The whole point (to me) of having a disk at home is to be able to access it no matter what. Also the content of that disk is not accessible by ANY means without going through the WD server - you cannot for instance connect USB or anything. So if the WD cloud is down for any reason (or your internet connection is down) you are out of luck. People have even tried to take the hard disk out and try to read the data but it is apparently in a proprietary format not a standard file system format. No thanks.So if you want to keep a bunch of photos documents PDFs etc and access them via the web without monthly fees this could work for you. Just be aware that unlike a "true cloud" service you do NOT have access to it in the case of a disaster (fire earthquake tornado etc.). And when the hard drive fails (as it inevitably will) the data is lost.But above all definitely definitely don't buy it for any kind of NAS application especially one that involves Mac computers. Only pain awaits.
5,The best decision I have ever made! No more purchasing storage space. I have terabytes of space now! It was simple and easy to use!
2,I have been using a 3 TB MyCloud with a connected USB hard drive for 4 years. Firmware to access the console is in the unit and can be accessed with any browser.  I am primarily a Linux user but do sometimes use Windows 10. This new Gen 2 4 TB unit can be accessed via a Linux file manager and files can be written to it.  However to use all features of the drive you'll need a smartphone app to access it and set it up.  After initial setup with the smartphone you can download and install a Windows app that has the same functionality as the smartphone app.When first plugged this unit in I got a flashing light on the front panel that persisted for 6 hours.  I then performed the "40 second reset" and the light continued to flash for another 30 hours!  I was preparing to return the drive to Amazon and unplugged it but on a whim plugged it back in.  The drive then came up.Once you download the smartphone app you can register the drive and then begin using it. Unlike the Gen 1 unit an external USB drive does not show to be mounted looking at this unit via file manager nor am I able to see the contents of the external drive via either the smartphone or Windows desktop app.  I was able to upload the contents of an attached USB drive to the WDMC unit but can only see what is written to the WDMC  by using the desktop WD app.  Once that was done Windows has mapped the content of the WDMC 4TB unit as Y:\Storage\Public\.  Under that directory I was able to see the files that were restored from the external USB drive as well as pictures backed up from my iPhone.I asked for tech support submitted a ticket but never received a reply.To sum up:1) My unit required a reset to get it booted and it took over 30 hours before I was finally able to use the thing.2) If you are using Linux you are able to see the drive under "Network Devices" with a file manager.  However you will only have access to a portion of the files. This severely limits usage.3) "Console" for the new drive shows limited info has minimal functionality and has to be accessed  with either a smartphone app or a Windows desktop app.  Not the same as the Gen 1 device where firmware is built into the unit and the "console" can be accessed with any web brower regardless of the operating system.4) Can't see the external mounted USB device on this unit.  You can tell it is there only by using one of the WD apps.  Was able to copy contents of the USB drive onto the new unit.5) In Windows you will have access to files on this unit in two places; under "Network" via file explorer and under \Storage\Public.6) No tech support from WD.
4,This is a good product but be aware it is NOT a NAS Drive you must have internet for this to work. You can't access it for your local network.
2,I have owned the older version of WD My Cloud for almost 8 years and I loved it! I could access it thru the windows explorer thru FTP access it thru PUTTY and also thru the My Cloud App on my laptop phone and tablets. Then in 2022 WD wanted to phase out older versions which blocked access to the device over the internet. I could still access it locally within my home. Eventually a few months later my wd my cloud stopped working. I was able to salvage the data myself by opening it and using sata to usb converter to get off the data. Now I use the older HDD as a USB external hdd.This was where we wanted to go with another of these to get things back online and accessible over the internet. The new my cloud home was extremely easy to setup. Practically 10 mins atmost.But when I copied a file by mapping the drive from regular windows explorer that file was not visible thru the app neither on my phones nor on the app on my other devices! Similarly when I copied the files from the app it wasn’t visible in the windows explorer!!!Furthermore the size of the mapped drive said 3.5 TB available out of 3.5 TB while the laptop app said 3.57 TB of 3.57 TB and the phone app said 3.85 TB of 4 TB available space!!! Funny that each of them were completely different by a few hundred GBs ….. hahaha!!!Moreover you can see your data on home.cloud.com. You need to login etc but still its over their website which I didn’t like.I am now researching a true NAS device like terramaster synology etc but definitely will move away from these wd clouds especially since it’s horribly locked up and seems to be very WD dependent if things go wrong.
4,My Cloud Home (nube privada) en mi experiencia de dos semanas es una excelente alternativa para realizar respaldos de tu información en tu hogar  y poder visualizarlos en cualquier parte con acceso a internet. My Cloud Home posee una configuración sencilla que es útil para aquellos que no poseen conocimientos ni requerimientos avanzados. Para los que deseen tener mayor control de su nube privada la configuración es limitada.Es una muy buena alternativa para disponer de una nube privada sin tener que contratar servicio alguno para que almacene tu información (fotos video archivos en general)
5,very easy to setup and begin using
5,This is the third WD My Cloud unit I have purchased.  First one failed after several years of working well.  It was a duo and had two drives.  Unfortunately the failure was in the way it communicated and not in either hard drive.  Since I am not sending my unit off with my data in it I tried to salvage the two drives full of data.  WD stores the RAID data in an almost unrecoverable format so I lost the data.  I did gain two working hard drives out of the failure however.  With this said the WD Home Cloud systems are great for home storage and should almost always be recoverable if a usual type problem happens.  I bought a single and another double (duo).  The way they move data is almost bulletproof and not subject to transfer failures as with many systems.  With the way they are securely accessed you have all your data and photos with you on your mobile devices anywhere you go.  I think every home and small office would benefit from owning one.  Just one bit of caution; NEVER TRUST ANY SINGLE SYSTEM WITH ALL YOUR DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP!!  Yes The unit that failed was backed up elsewhere.  BTW these can easily transfer their data to another USB backup device by plugging it into the back of the device.
4,Third WD product I've been using and I have no complaints. There was a little bit of a learning curve setting it up with Plex but it all works great now!
5,I like the idea of sharing with my photos with my family. Also like that fact that I can pull pictures up at anytime.
4,I am just happy it worked right out of the box. Switched my Time Machine to it and set up a cloud app. That’s all I wanted.
3,This is a product review update. The product now conforms to my needs.
4,The price was good.  Setup was a peace of cake.  The included instructions were extremely poor.  Something I did not expect from WD.  The instructions were more like a cheap chinese copy.  However the online documentation is excellent.  I did knock it down because For whatever reason WD does not allow it to be used for computer backup.  This was a planned use of it.  I did find that there is some other software out there that will allow it I haven't tried it yet.After a 1 year use I would probably knock it down to 3 stars.  I still find it really amazing that I cannot do a windows 10 backup without buying additional software.  I had found a software that worked for a while but stopped working.  Another issue is that large files are transferred very slowly.  I can do small files like pictures pretty quick almost like normal but large files can take a long time.  I moved  a 20gb backup file that took over an hour.  It is not what I expected.  I may switch and use it as an external drive as it appears to work quite quickly for that.  Surprisingly one thing it does well is automatic backups of my phones.
5,Was using a 4TB older version that WD notified me they were going to stop supporting (it’s was getting close to 10 years old). Been planning to upgrade and this gave me a good reason. Best part is the phone app addition!!! Can access my personal items anywhere without having to upload to a cloud. Movies photos legal docs etc… super easy to access now.
2,I followed the instructions which were basically plug it in. After that I was on my own. There is nothing about how I could get my computers to recognize it to get it set up for time machine or even get it visible on the computer's list of drives. I contacted tech-support through chat. The first was very helpful but didn't know what he was doing. The second one knew more but he tried to set up a screen sharing session which was crazy complicated and ultimately after an hour on chat tech-support I abandoned the effort. I will try to call later when I have time. I am not having a lot of confidence that this is going to be a workable solution for my back up hard drive. This could not have been more complicated and I'm reasonably capable when it comes to hardware like this. Very frustrating.
3,The first thing you need to know is that you are on your own if you buy this product and need technical support from Western Digital.I have and from what I've read I'm not alone have folders disappearing from the drive. The folders (directories) with all their files are missing. The first time it happen I thought I was losing it. Sadly I haven't lost my mind but thousands of files that put on the drive for safe-keeping.I tried to contact Western Digital it appears you can only do so via their website but I've gotten no responses to the request for help. The WD (Western Digital) does not even provide utilities or tools to fix the apparent file structure issue if they didn't I would need the help.I cannot recommend this product due to its unreliable nature.I strongly suggest that you avoid this manufacturer. It doesn't require much to support this type of product just a set of administrative utilities and tools but there is nothing and with no technical support you the user are left with a product you do not trust with the one thing you bought it for... storing files!
1,First off I am livid. This just crashed today 9 days after the 2 year mark. Where to start. The software when it runs is slow there is no wifi and it is a shingled drive.  I never even got it filled like 2/3 maybe.  But any time something had to be re written it was like usb2 slow.  The software doesn't work in Linux period you have to use the web interphase which some how manages to be 3x slower than the already slow wd driver for windows android and apple. For some reason it uses a proprietary protocol so SMB is shot does not work. It will set up a slow plex server. the 8tb model does ok on simple formats but MKV format video makes it chug to where I usually move the file rather than stream.  So today it started making a horrible sound. The tracking arm(in drive) sounds like its constantly recalibrating or moving and the light is flashing failure.  I pulled the unit  apart to reveal a plastic case designed to fail if taken apart. I tried getting thin plastic picks in but Honestly you wouldn't be able to get a 3/1000 feeler gauge in between the plastic tabs  I have rebuilt car engines servers clients. I managed control systems for a large food plant.  I have been in the labs of cpu manufacturing.  I am familiar with 7/8 different kinds of x64 linux.  So its a single board computer with a big heatsink a usb3 for an expanding drive? but all communication with the SBC is by ethernet and as I have said the interphase is very proprietary and limited.  I pulled the drive from the sbc and plugged it into my desktop.  Bios cant find it. nothing in windows can find it.  I have pictures from my kids birth on there that I am not sure is backed up.  I have the whole thing in a box right now and now I got to go pay data recovery.  The pcb is dual layer It's cheap like I wonder if a pi zero has more computes.  If I could do it again I would of 1: never gotten a shingled drive.  2: picked a sbc that supports SMB or some other accessible protocol from linux. I honestly thought this was going to be better made.  A Purpose built home nas  but really the drive is trash the protocols are proprietary and slow.  The SBC is a no name ethernet only doubt if it's even 64bit piece of e waste and the cheap plastic case does more to hold in heat and prevent you from opening the thing than it does to "protect anything".  never get below a blue drive.  This is trash and it will be an ordeal for data recovery.
3,This device works as advertised. It's super easy to set up and use.I recommend this device if you don't care that your stored stuff is always exposed to the internet AND if you don't need easy access to your data in case you lose access to the internet.Files stored on this device are accessible from the internet only via authentication through a Western Digital web site. That's great as long as security holds but I'm not comfortable with that arrangement for my super sensitive stuff. If I were only storing non-sensitive files I would love this device but I want to use it for all my files.Also you can't access files on this device if you can't get to the internet. I have all my computer equipment on battery backup but that does no good if I can't access my storage when the WD website is inaccessible.One other thing when the hard drive dies you can't replace it yourself. You have to send it to WD. Well you CAN replace it if you tear the case apart but it's not supposed to be serviced by users.So if you want a storage device that's easy to set up and easy to access from anywhere and you don't care about the other stuff listed above this is a great device.
3,Pros:  This drive is very easy to install and setup;  I had no problems at all and it seems to work fine for file storage.  However….  Cons:  There is no way to back up the entire drive to a USB hard drive or to any other offsite location.  The apps to be able to manage the drive have been stripped to the bare minimum and there is no way to be able to logon to the drive itself to manage it (our previous drive was a WD MyCloud where these functions were available).  All in all for a long term storage solution it is risky because it cannot be backed up.
1,First I admit I can take some responsibility for the long install ordeal.  I HATE updating my operating system.  I had an old release of MacOS (which is no older than the device in question) when I first begun the install.  This yielded an error message that instructed me to use System Preferences to authorize their software to connect the Cloud.  Alas the instructions were wrong as no such options existed in the OS system.  After a 4 hour text interaction with their support service during which I was asked (several times) to do the very same install and uninstall procedures including terminal commands to scrub my HD for hidden files their uninstaller doesn't succeed in removing we accomplished absolutely nothing and I have to conclude that their software is absolutely not functional unless you have the latest release of MacOS installed.  So I uninstalled everything upgraded my OS in service of their install (and lost functionality of several apps I've been using for years) and finally was able to install and use the drive as intended.But do note this cloud is not simply "plug and play" after setup on Mac.  Every time you use it you have to run their software and log into their system to connect to and allow your computer to detect it as a drive and THEN you open a file explorer window to use it.  If you walk away long enough for your machine to sleep it will not remember your login.  You'll have to start from scratch and rerun the software to reveal the cloud in your file system.So it works and I start by doing what I bought it for and move about 80GB of raw photo files to my new Cloud Drive.  This process gets about halfway through before it experienced an error and aborted.  At this point I'm pretty disgusted and have no idea how much of this relatively basic transfer is faulty missing or simply not written yet.  My phone seems able to happily back up it's cameral roll to it with no error messages so I continue using it for that and will delve into the bigger file issues later.Or not.  On day 3 or 5 all of my devices refer to this cloud as merely "offline" although every other device on my network is communicating without any trouble.  I have done the recommended 60 second unplug to reset it several times and mobile devices can briefly find it but before long it simply goes offline without any error message or clue as why.  No device or web access can find it and WD's website support system only seems to offer solutions that obviously don't fix this problem with the exception of one I haven't tried that requires permanent deletion of all data as the first trouble shooting step.  I'm pretty close to my limit here.  This thing is worthless.  I'm likely to return it soon.
5,I have an old amount that is still kicking hard-core. I bought this originally for a back up and learned the features have become so much more advance. I use this one full-time now and keep my old one as a back up. Set up was fairly easy. Follow directions and make sure you connected to your router. Transferring files from my old one to this one very easy. Can be time consuming pending on your Internet connection.
5,I have no doubt that over the years this has saved it’s purchase price. The only possible knock against it I’ll give Is you can’t integrate the storage like apple iCloud so no convenient phone backups but aside from that it’s just as useful as any other cloud storage (Dropbox google drive one drive etc) and especially when google photos stopped providing unlimited storage I just switched to using this for photo backups. With 2TB of cloud storage normally costing at least $10/mo this should save its cost in around a year considering you get double that storage. I believe when I purchased mine it was $179
1,TLDR: Current "My Cloud Home" desktop software doesn't work with the latest MacOS BigSur. Troubleshooting matter and basic quality test of the mobile app upload/read/delete corrupts the actual directory in your Mac's Finder app. Leaving you with no reliable way to access your stored files.I am writing this on June 10 2021. MacOS Big Sure has been out for over 8 months and companies have had access to the latest OS for over a year. So it's inexcusable for their desktop application to not work on the latest MacOS. Just google "My Cloud Home Big Sur" and you'll get all the warning you should need.Here's my deal and why I ended up returning the product:So setup was pretty easy until the desktop application prompts you for an update. You run the update and then the product becomes useless. After running the update you will longer see the device in your Finder app and be forced to use a web or mobile app if you wish to interact with your My Cloud Home which is just a terrible thing to have to do if your setting it up and moving a lot of files on it for the first time.Anyway their "work around" to to simply uninstall the latest version of their desktop software and reinstall a previous version for it to work on BigSur. While it's a terrible practice at least I might be able to finally get this thing setup and working. Wrong! So I got the desktop app rolled back I a previous version and started moving files over. Progress....I wanted to test the mobile app's ability to interact with files I have moved over so I opened some folders saw a handful of files and decided to delete a handful and wanted to go back to the desktop app to see how well that worked. It couldn't have gone any worse.... I opened finder and tried to open the My Cloud directory and my Mac just crapped out and eventually dropped the My Cloud Home from being able to be seen from the Finder app.I am done and about to head down to Whole Foods to return this thing. Also as a side note.... I am leaving out a lot of painful troubleshooting and Mac slowdown this whole thing caused. I am pretty tech savvy having been a Software Engineering Manager and Cloud Engineer so I am aware of when something is just flat out not worth the effort of troubleshooting with tech support and cut bait and find something else. If your solution is "since our latest software version won't work after nearly a year of the latest OS release and less than 4 months from a newer OS release then your support mantra can't be to fix/resolve your product's problem. It is to just put a bandaid on it until you will have to "call" back later."
3,It seems very easy to set up but it is constantly spinning and running causing it to make a lot of noise. If it isn't in a room you spend time in it could be manageable but if you are in the same room it is really loud all the time.
4,If you are looking for online storage this NAS works fine.  I cannot say I recommend running any apps on it though.  One supposedly can run "server" apps such as Plex and ChannelsDVR.  My results running ChannelsDVR were not good.  Lockups and processing problems abounded.  I finally gave up and purchased a separate Lenovo M93 SFF Tiny desktop and use it as a dedicated ChannelsDVR server.  I use this NAS for the ChannelsDVR online storage.  Everything is connected by a hardwired gigabyte LAN.  I have had no issues since and throughput is quite good.  Access to this NAS depends a fair amount on a web-page interface so if you are really "techie" this dumbed-down page approach is a bit tedious.In a nutshell I think this is a reasonably good and affordable NAS but I would not recommend it for running any of the online server-type apps you might find on more powerful NAS units.  For the price this is a good unit.  It runs RAID and you can disable that and double your storage space but that will defeat the purpose of a RAID of course.
2,I appreciate the large storage capacity and ease of basic power on/configuration but this device:- claims "Social Media" support but the Windows app does not offer Facebook as a feature.- does not show up as a network device properly in Win 10- upon cloud configuration of Plex (apparently needed to stream photos/videos from it) throws this error:This page isn’t workingprod-0c50c2782852d84.wdckeystone.com is currently unable to handle this request.HTTP ERROR 502- Upon clicking icons in the Windows app to install the tool needed to perform automatic backups (fundamental function!) throws an "installation error" within the app. Super basic Win10 PC nothing strange and I've been doing IT work for 20+ years.I don't want to wrestle with calling tech support for "unusually long hold times" and I don't want features like 'enabling likes' on my assets. I just want a large backup drive that lets you sync to it. This is disappointing.Also- arrived at doorstep in only its retail packaging with clear plastic sleeve. Seems a little risky.
4,This NAS is easy to setup and is pletty fast for the home. However less technically inclined customers will require help setting up the Plex Media Server. Plex allows your Smart TV to see this NAS as a Media Server. You can play any of your Movies Music and Pictures on your TV using this server. The setup for what is called a DLNA server is not simple enough that anyone can do it without some assistance. There are some online tutorials available. Just installing and enabling the Plex Server is not enough you must also enable DLNA before your TV will see the server. And there other settings in Plex that need to be changed. I am writing this review partly as a warning to anyone considering buying one of these. If your not someone who is comfortable getting in to the settings to make some of the more advanced features work then this may not be for you.
3,I should have read more reviews.  This is not a typical NAS for home network storage.  I can be used in a roundabout way as a NAS but this is really a home cloud storage device.You can't directly manage this like one does with other NAS devices.  My other network drives are manageable through a browser.  I can set up shares set a static IP address rename it etc...  This device supports none of that.The first clue out of the box should have been the quick set up.  It had a drawing of a phone with the URL in the browser.  When loaded you can set up the device and then it asks if I wanted to back up my phone to the device.  I'll admit it was a slick feature but not what I expected.  I used the same URL on my home desktop and it automatically mapped a drive to the device.  So yes I can store my files on the drive as a back up and I've decided that's exactly what this will become a backup drive not a working drive as part of my network storage array.I don't think I'll purchase another of these and I'm still looking for new storage but I can use this.Buyer beware - the description doesn't match the expectation.
4,I purchased a similar product like this one but it broke down on me after about 5 years so I bought a new one with bigger storage.  Takes a while to back up all of my folders because of network communication instead of direct USB connection to my lap top.
4,Setup was a little bit of a pain as the unit did not want to recognize my network. Took several hours of messing with settings to finally get it to recognize it. Once it recognized the network setup was a breeze. That was for windows 10. I'm moving to Linux and there is little support for the drive for Linux so having to figure that piece on my own. If you are technically savvy with Linux you may not have an issue.
4,Muy bueno por el tema de accesibilidad y poder almacenar y acceder información desde cualquier dispositivo desde cualquier parte del mundo.  Un poco lento en ransferencia de datos pero es muy útil
4,Overall for manually backing up data it seems to work fine. I though I was buying a version that I could use docker images on but turned out not to be. The built in "apps" for syncing are kind of average where you can only sync one google account at a time. The "WD Backup" app also never worked for me so I had to find a third party app to regularly back up my laptop
5,I ordered this to replace an older model and was extremely pleased with this new design. It looks good operates good and is super easy to use. I had all my pictures transferred over in just a few hours and I could not believe how simple it was to do so! I highly recommend this product.
3,They advertise My Cloud Home as a "seamless" Windows backup device all over their product features web pages but forget it!  Oh it's a fine storage device but I've had this thing for several weeks now and am STILL trying to find a workable means to use it as a backup device.  They used to have a backup solution for its predecessor My Cloud but have abandoned both that hardware and software and now they got nothing to utilize with the new hardware.  Windows Backup sucks. Their Support responses for solutions are utterly useless.  Their disinformation is about as unethical as legally possible.
4,There are a LOT of one star reviews on this product because it is different than the former generation WD my cloud in that it is not a traditional NAS. however it does do what it is advertised for as an at home "cloud storage" device  and Plex server that works pretty seamlessly. If you want to do the nuts and bolts of setting up a "server" don't buy this and honestly it is not advertised as such. If you want a simple easy to set up way to stream your owned content to any device at home or away  this works well. it does take awhile to upload all of your content I had 1 TB of video files but once it does the plex server works well. The labeling of content is a bit tricky but that is how plex works. overall a good purchase. it's like a car put the gas in and go and don't worry about the mechanics of everything.
3,Like all WD products ( I have many) it comes with zippo instructions other than a 3x3 tag in 6 languages and has 3 icons to walk you through setup.I'm a marketing/social media manager and work with terabytes with of data and images and was hoping this would be a quick easy fix to back up data (and yes I have other backups but was hoping this would be an easy plug-and-play bonus backup).Thus far (even with their meager tech support) I can't get data to back up more than 1 file at a time with no way to organize it. I have client folders with multiple subfolders within each one.  In the event of a crash I can't comb thru terabytes of info looking for one image/file.I'm going to harass my friend that referred me to this product to see if they can help me set it up and will adjust my review then accordingly.  Until then just know that is NOT a quick solution.
1,I should have stopped unpacking this unit the moment I pulled out "the quick installation guide." It is a postcard with the word "HELLO" on one side and on the other an IKEA diagram with the rubric "Need help? mycloud.com/support." Then the fun begins. This unit has without a doubt the most obscure registration/installation process I have ever encountered. Let us start with the registration process. You are directed to a web page were you are asked to fill out a form. It asks you for the device type you are registering. Well this unit is not included amongst the drop down choices so you have to choose "Other." This is a bad sign... Then you are asked for the unit's serial number that  begins with "WXD." Well the serial number on the unit's packaging does not begin with "WXD.'" Finally you are asked to submit proof of purchase by choosing a "pdf" file on your computer for uploading. Why this invasion of privacy I have no idea. Nevertheless you create "Idiotic.pdf" and try to I guess "Open" it. Nope none of this works. Why? Good luck finding out as the registration form does not give you a clue of what is wrong. YOU CANNOT REGISTER THE DEVICE. Well onwards and upwards. I want to map this device to my laptop as I want to use it exclusively as a private storage device. Now comes the really(?) confusing part of this process. Let's start with "If My Cloud device name has not changed." So far no option has been given to do this in the initial installation process. Perhaps a magical gremlin has done it? You attempt to soldier on but you now encounter caveat after caveat on Windows 10 and instructions that have been written by someone  who is familiar neither with logic branching ("if... then..") nor clear English syntax. YOU CANNOT MAP THE DEVICE... EASILY (as they promised.) God knows what the complexity level is for other unit configurations.  I will probably throw this unit out and write off several hundred dollars.  Hours have been spent on what should be a simple process (they promise that you know...) Customer service phone number? Don't be ridiculous.
5,The 20Tb WD my cloud is truly plug and play simple.I am a techie but I really didn’t need to use any tricks or shorts. Literally you plug it up and log into the web portal.My only complaint if you can call it that is that you need to login to the web portal and keep it open to be connected to the drive. So if you are setup for your pc to regularly restart itself then you will need to reconnect through the web portal.I love it. For my purposes.
1,If you do not have a connection of at least 200mbps on both ends this will not be worth your purchase. We have moved the hub several times to find the best connection. We started with it at my home that had 80mbps. It was ok for accessing documents but opening a folder with 100 photos would take over 30 minutes and uploading a 2GB folder took all night. We then moved it to a home with 200mbps and it worked better but regretfully most of my family lives in Latin America where the connections are 50 to 100mbps and they cannot access the files in a reasonable time. For someone with a 50mbps connection it takes about 40 minutes to open a folder with a couple hundred photos (meaning so they can see the thumbnails) even though the hub is at a 200mbps connection. So only get this device or similar ones if you will always have ultra fast connections.By the way we thought there might be something wrong with the apparatus but WD tech support said that all was working fine when we spoke on the phone and that is how the product works.We no longer use our hub and instead have purchased space on clouds. Over the long run it may be pricier but it is so much faster and more convenient.
2,I purchased 3 WD My Clouds in the past. They performed as expected except for their relatively short lifespan of 2 - 4 years. My new WD My Cloud HOME was a major disappointment for at least 3 reasons.1) Not suitable for photographs.a. If a single folder contains more than 500 photos simply opening the folder requires 3 - 5 minutes.b. If a single folder contains 500 or more photos merging the contents of another folder into it requires one hour or more.2) Not visible by default.You must launch the WD Discover app every time you restart the computer to mount the drive. (Adding the app to your startup items does not work.)3) Every time you mount the drive an error message appears which indicates that the Z: drive is not available even though it is.The older WD My Cloud drives do not exhibit any of these issues. It is only the WD My Cloud Home that has these problems. The difference appears to be the file system. The older drives employ the NTFS file system while the Home drive uses the KDD (proprietary?) file system.Tech support tried to blame my computer and network even though 3 of four of their drives are performing as expected with the same computer and on the same network.If you do not need to store more than 500 files in a single folder you may be OK. But this limitation may be an indication of a larger issue.
4,Take the time to understand HOW this product works before you purchase it.  It's primary design intent is to automatically backup files from your computers.  I wanted a NAS to use as a media server.  This does work for that but not nearly as well as some of WD's older products.  I do use this as a NAS and find that I have to manually run the "WD Discovery" app every time my system restarts in order to see my "personal" files.  The "Shared" files and folders are available to most devices on my network.  I can view pics and vids on FireTV Firestick and Apple TV but not on my iPhone or iPad.  I use VLC media play app on all of the above named devices which might be why.  Dig through their support forums about this for much more details.
5,Totally great! Installation overall was smooth and easy. Bear in mind if you erase all data or doing hard reset it would take a long time to see it online again My cloud service will not be able to find it for 15 minutes or more. I struggled with my Asus router settings for a while but was able to figure it out finally. When you are locally connected you’ll see Local in settings. When you open it from outside  your LAN it’ll be Direct or Relay. Turn on port forwarding UnPP and assign a fixed local ip. Or just try it right away quite probably it’ll work by default.It has tons of features. I was able to synchronise it one way with my Dropbox and now when I add something to Dropbox it instantly appears in My cloud(not the other way round) Same can be done with Facebook Instagram iCloud and many others. My cloud desktop installed a network drive by itself. All technical settings are great and you cannot change much meaning you cannot spoil the show that is why it is a Home not a Nerd version:)
5,Bought this with the singular purpose to act as a simple and “invisible” backup device for my parents’ MacBook Pro (late 2013). Setup was fairly straightforward and set up Time Machine backups to save to the MyCloud. Cut to 3 months later and the MacBook Pro stops booting. Parents call me up and I say no problem. It wouldn’t boot and it wouldn’t directly restore from the Time Machine backup while booting in Repair mode. So I erased the laptop’s storage and reinstalled the OS. After installation and Once I could boot to the OS setup menu I was able to restore the data from the MyCloud Time Machine volume. Really saved the day. The only hiccup was accessing the Time Machine volume because it asks for a username/password which doesn’t work. You have to access the Time Machine volume as a Guest user for it to work. All In all it really saved the day.The only thing I haven’t figured out is how to set up an Apple Photos library on the MyCloud. The app on the laptop has trouble opening a photo library on a networked device.
4,While you can make as many dobelle as you wish only music video and photos put in Plex Folders show up on your TV.Access to the other you make comes via your computer or smartphone My Cloud app.On computer you use WD Discovery software to use and maintain constant access to your NAS.WORKS AS EXPECTED and would recomend to smaller users.
4,We have had it for about a month. It works but is slow.... I don't understand as to why it is so slow. I think it is the software app. So I would not buy another one just because of the software. Once they make their software work then I would recommend it.
3,The drive came and looks nice but beyond looks its usability is very low. The device would not appear in my network no matter what I did. Even entering and assigning it by using the MAC address. After installing it using the WD software it creates a mapped drive on your system so you think. You can access the mapped drive only from the system you install the software on. Using another computer you can find the drive in the network but not the mapped link itself. Using other streaming devices you can not find this drive at all unless you are using plex and activate the plex link. The backup features are useless as WD's installed software can't find its own mapped drive. It continues to state no devices found. If I plug in one of my external WD drives it finds those drives immediately but it can't find its own cloud drive. Many others had complained about WD software and drives but up until now I've never had trouble with them but this was my first cloud drive purchase from them. All my other other drives are external usb drives. To move my network into its next phase of development it appears I'll be moving away from wd drives.
1,I purchased a WD My Cloud Home Duo (16 TB) because I was looking for an easy to share files with family members on my local network and also be able to access these files while away from home via a mobile app. After reading several reviews of network attached storage (NAS) devices I settled on the WD My Cloud Home Duo because it was highly rated by several tech review websites for its ease of use and I have purchased several WD hard drives and external storage devices in the past.Unfortunately I was immediately disappointed because sharing files between users on the same network is much more cumbersome than described. First everyone has to make a mycloud.com account. Then the device owner needs to create a folder specifically for file-sharing and then invite everyone to access this folder. And finally the kicker is that these users cannot access this shared folder via Windows explorer - it must be accessed through the mycloud.com in-browser app or it appears mounted as a separate network drive than the My Cloud Home Duo. The My Cloud Home Duo gets mounted as a Z: drive and the shared folder gets mounted as a Y: drive. All I wanted was a shared network location for my household to dump some files and instead I got a much more limited version of Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive which completely defeats its purpose. And having the shared folder appear as a separate network drive is a very clunky and inconvenient experience.I do not recommend this device to anyone. I browsed through the WD community forums and found that there was an easy to share files on your local network - there apparently used to be a 'Family' folder accessible to all network users that could be viewed like a normal folder in Windows Explorer but for some reason WD removed this feature in 2019 software update and never restored it despite outrage from the community. Instead either get a true NAS device or pay for cloud storage. The WD My Cloud Home Duo tries to find some weird middle ground and instead fails to do either.
2,I previously had a single-bay WD MyCloud NAS that was great.  But recently WD forced an upgrade because of a security protocol that allegedly couldn't be upgraded.  So rather than have to evaluate new brands I went with what seemed like a logical trade...to a single-bay WD MyCloud Home.  Well the MyCloud Home (MCH) is described as a "Personal Cloud" and they mean it.  It is NOT a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device.  It actually works really seamlessly if all you want is a personal cloud.  It will automatically sync the photos on your phone to the MCH.  You can even send links to others so that they can view files on your MCH without them having to have an account.  But the data transfer is slow the user interface is clunky and worst of all you can't easily share folders with other users on the same network.  I wish WD had simply added the features that I mentioned above to the already great NAS features the MyCloud (original) had and I would have given it 5 stars.  But the MCH was surely not what I expected from WD.  Unfortunately this one's getting returned and I will have to try out a Synology NAS.
3,I have another WD NAS; it is a WD MyCloud and it works perfectly.  The WD MyCloud HOME does not work the same.  The device is a NAS and I have it connected to my home network; however according to WD Tech support one has to be connected to the internet to use the device.  My planned purpose was to backup to the NAS while the internet is not connected then turn off the MyCloud Home while on the internet.  WD Tech support indicated it will not work without internet connection.  While connected to the internet the WD software will map a drive Z to the NAS device and I can access it with File Explorer or similar program but my image backup software will not find it either as a NAS when given the IP number or when attempting to backup to the mapped drive.
3,The only issue I have is you have to plug  this in directly into the Internet tower My Internet around the whole house work fine when I plug this unit in it works fine by itself it downloaded my photos from out of town so the cloud works it just pulls so much off my Internet that the bandwith is weakened a lot i now have to get extenders. And it only happens sometimes it  Fluctuates.its frustrating  when u have wireless tv's bulbs and camera's.
3,Dificultad lentitud y diseño nada intuitivo para sincronizaciones de computador a dispositivo. Actualizaciones de software del equipo no funcionan en versiones nuevas de MacOs. Se actualizó solo en la Mac dejo de funcionar y tras varios días en un foro del proveedor recién indicaron que era mejor volver a versión anterior de la app si estas en MacOs mojave high sierra y otros increíble que algo así suceda y sin aviso oficial ya que tuve que indagar por días que sucedía hasta darme cuenta que a miles de usuarios les sucedió lo mismo(Al día de hoy tras volver a version anterior me sigue pidiendo actualizar a nueva version pese a que no funcionaría). Imposibiliad de seleccionar sub-carpetas específicas a sincronizar desde backups de pendrive o disco externo hacia el home duo (que es la modalidad más veloz). En términos de hardware es robusto y eficiente sin embargo su usabilidad deja mucho pero mucho que desear. Definitivamente hay una oportunidad de mercado para que otro competidor lo haga mucho mejor.
3,This is not a NAS I wish I had known that before buying (I have never owned one before). This "thing" is dumbed down to a point of it being just a basic household appliance. It is designed as a replacement to popular services like dropbox. This is something that you would give to someone who is very privacy conscious but not very experienced with tech. There are virtually no settings to configure. That being said what prevents me from giving this one star is that it is serving as a very simple to use Time Machine backup which is why I wanted a NAS in the first place. So it is managing to serve it's one purpose. I'm just disappointed because I was hoping to create an extra partition for some other things.TL;DR : If you know how to use a computer and want an actual NAS buy something else. This thing is designed for the rest of us.
4,Within a year of purchasing roughly 10 months I received an email from Western Digital saying they’re no longer supporting this backup drive.  Unbelievable!  They’re telling me there will be security exposure and updated firmware is not available.  I’m less than pleased
1,If you are getting a cloud drive just to be cool go ahead and get this device. Easy to setup. If you are however really going to use it don't waste your money and time. It is painfully slow especially if you are working with large amounts of files almost unusable. The old My Cloud worked great and since they no longer support this product I was forced to downgrade to this new horrible system. By the way don't think that you can get support for this because the only answer you get when you open a ticket or call in is search our support page. Sorry I don't usually write reviews but I thought I would try to save someone from the pain I have endured working with this device.Also I just figured out there is no Safe Points like the old My Cloud. Unless you subscribe to a cloud backup service there is currently no way to back up the My Cloud Home. You can use a USB drive to manually copy the content but no way to keep the backup current even though I bought a My Book to use as a backup. I get more disappointed with this product every day. I wish I didn't have so many hours invested in setting up my data or I would return it.
4,I saw a lot of negative comments before buying this but I did my due diligence as to what I was looking for. If you are looking for a NAS this is not what you want. This module is perfect for me as it maps a network drive onto your computer and you can login and access your drive from anywhere as long as you are connected to the internet. I keep my work files and media in this Cloud Drive and access them from anywhere. This is great!
3,They have a good concept that you are building your own cloud. But alas they chose not to implement some of the NAS like features that they had on their older MyCloud devices.  They don't even have advanced settings.  You can't do a lot of things!Like choosing the drive sleep time etc. The hard drive inside this thing just keeps spinning and spinning. Does not go into spindown idle.You can't turn off the cloud access even if you wanted to. WD should have atleast provided the flexibility to their customers.Additionally you can't access this through local accounts on your NAS. So forget accessing through something like Linux.On windows or mac they provide you a wd discovery app. But its not on available to the general public for download. you have to request the link through the app and then login to your email on your desktop to download the installer. A totally unnecessary cumbersome method.The desktop app on windows is OK! But I think it was spawning multiple background processes and I could see them consuming CPU time even when it was not being used.The above is just a few observations in the 1st few hours that I have had it. I am having a classic case of buyers remorse!
3,Good but Difficult and not Similar to Other WD NAS Devices in Connectivity
5,So far I have had no problem with this device.  It took me a couple of days to put the information I needed to have access too from among 3 computers I use for various projects in my house.  At times the exchange of information was slower than expected and hung up a few times for me this was to be somewhat expected initially.  I will run a program on it later to hopefully pare down the usage because I am sure it is filled with some duplicate files.My hope is to be able to share and exchange files between my computers without having to use usb dongles or sd cards and so far this is working.I am hoping this holds up well and will give me a few years of NAS service.
5,Storage capacity is great for all the family pictures and files all are cells linked to home cloud. It is quite easy to install and very user friendly software/app is much better than previous cloud version. I bought this because my 1st cloud was no longer going to be supported thru my home network or remote access. This user interface is much easier. I truly recommend this product specially if you pay extra for iCloud services. You can access your files from anywhere.
1,Got this one to replace a MyCloud 4TB device that decided to lose it's mind - thinking that this is a 5+ year newer model and would be even more flexible - and man am I upset to not read the reviews thoroughly first.This unit has NO NAS functionality.  None. You can't access anything to set it so it is not internet facing.  Frankly that is disgraceful. Keeping the hackers out of the IOT is a serious thing and WD dropped the ball on this one big time.SECOND (and more important) - we used our MyCloud as a shared NAS - we have many DVDs we own and many audiobooks we own that we want to have local access to on our various internet devices inside our local network (old tablets the TV the XboxOne Rokus etc etc) Twonky worked on the old unit and you could stream inside the house - now I have to allow this MyCloud HOME to NOT stay at home but has to ping the internet or else it can't be accessed... further it must be a Windows or AppleOS machine to access it AND it MUST be 64 bit (no old Toughbooks allowed) - OR you can get kludgy (and I do mean KLUDGY) single file downloads to the android and IOS devices to get it to listen to an audiobook - and just give up it you want to watch a streamed video... not happening.WD you all really REALLY stepped on it with this one... I'm keeping it though as I don't trust it to wipe itself to be able to send back and I can pull the 4tb drive out rig up a RaspberryPi server and do all the things I need it to do for a small adder from what I've already invested in this replacement.... the 4TB red drive is $100 anyway so I get a $50 lesson in learning to read the specs better and figuring out how you really wrecked a good line of products.
4,I have had numerous drives from WD in all shapes and sizes and use most of them still. I bought this one For Plex and home storage. I was a bit bummed that they decided to put in an entire new interface (which means a new app logon and son on). I was also bummed because the interface is aimed at the less powerful user. There are a few options I wish I had access to but that may come later. The one thing i will say is buy a bigger drive than you THINK you need. Remember the 8GB product marketing really means 4GB of available because of the RAID configuration. If you know what that is and need it this is a good unit to consider. More advanced users should seek a Synology.
4,The set up is easy. Just download a software and it will automatically mount the drive for you. It works as my backup cloud storage for my iPhone photos. The only drawback of this is you cannot transfer your file using USB. It will take sometime to transfer your photo to your local hdd if you have tons of photos and slow Wi-Fi. Also be aware that the drive storage is 3.5TB if you buy a 4TB.
4,Worked great for me! I was able to transfer complete folders from a Windows computer (others stated you could only transfer individual files) set up was a breeze Easy to view download and upload files from a remote computer or mobile phone. It even workes great with my turtle slow dsl and meets my need to share data with family and friends. Very happy so far but it's still only day 3! Easy to add folders from PC but finding it difficult to add folders from Android so I'm removing one star.
4,This is a replacement unit for a My Cloud unit which was 3 years old and  was no longer able to access it outside my home network.  The set up is quite simple and WD packed a lot of features into this unit.  However they have so many variations of this product that their documentation is very generic as they tried to address a number of products with a generic set of instructions.  Furthermore the desktop app comes with apps that do not work for the y Cloud Home devices.  Why would anyone release apps that are not intended to be used with this mode is beyond me.Other than that the sync process works well and it works seamless with both Windows and Apple native backup software.  Having a RAIDed system makes me feel at ease knowing that I have redundancy built in.If you are a beginner user or if you want ease of set up and simplicity this is definitely the device for you.  On the other hand if you want to administer disk quotas and be able to tailor its functionality; or if you are an experienced user look at other similar WD products.
4,I like WD been a long time user. I use these as a NAS only and do not use the cloud based software. I find the user interface clunky. I would prefer something else I would not buy another cloud based NAS device from WD myself. The product overall functions and works well besides that feature.
5,Wish I knew it was not just an updated version of the old one the "HOME"  version lack functionality of the older version as many other 1 star reviews noted.  Can only connect to it via their proprietary desktop agent which magically asked for my credentials like I am a new user regularly.  (they forced their software in to the network path and then it acts poorly).  I have the old non-Home version and it's fine.The partial positive thing is the Plex software which I can connect to via a laptop or Amazon fire stick - but on mine it keeps getting removed/disabled and I have to manually go back to the web interface and add it back.  ie it's completely unreliable.
1,After less than 60 days of use this has drive been relegated to use as a 5-pound PAPERWEIGHT on my desk - that irks me to no end every time I have to look at it.Basically it boils down to this: Everything you read about what this drive can do - IT CAN'T DO. That may sound like an overly dramatic statement but it is 100% true. I had two samples of this drive because the first one was broken right out of the box. After waiting for 120-days for a replacement I FINALLY got a working version of this product. [I'm using the term "WORKING VERSION" loosely because I got an EQUAL amount of work out of the first BROKEN drive as I got out of the replacement drive - ZERO WORK and 6-months of horrible WD customer service support - where once you mention the product your calling in reference to - THEY SIMPLY HANG UP ON YOU.Bottom line: take 6x $100 bills and set them ablaze that way you'll at least get 20 seconds of warmth out fo the deal. and THAT would be far more work than I got out of 6-months of A-G-O-N-I-Z-I-N-G ownership of this WD 16 TB My Cloud Personal hard drive.I've owned dozens and dozens of Wester Digital drives over a 25-year span. Six out of six of the $600-$1500 WD drives I purchased in the past 9-months all CATAUSTROPHICALLY FAILED for one reason or another. Clearly WD has a PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE product policy they are following. It's time to look elsewhere for hard drives.WOULD I RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT: Yes (to my worst enemy)!
1,Purchased this in June and it stopped working about a month later.  Western Digital customer support is the worst I have ever dealt with.  They keep wanting me to send them log files from it I cannot make them understand that when you turn it on the fan starts and it does not boot up.  How can you retrieve log files if it won't boot up.  I already have a ton of personnel and financial files on it so if they finally ask for it back I can't send it.Also the app doesn't work on Windows 10 so you have to manually back up everything.Android phone app worked fine.If you have 400 bucks to throw away then purchase this if not stay away from Western Digital and purchase something reliable.
2,If you want more advanced controls stay away from MyCloud.  Very little in the way of configuration (which I guess some might like) however once configured there are no options to change network settings.
2,It is impossible to mount as a network drive without constantly running WD's poorly written resource-intensive app "WD Discovery" which must be installed on every device you wish to connect to it.  It is unusable without internet access even after being set up with the app.Furthermore everyone who buys this will lose access to all of the files they store on these devices because WD has stopped supporting their app which is needed to connect to this device.Also the download speeds are terribly slow and it disconnects periodically which makes it a sketchy backup drive if you are using it as a windows 10 backup.  The download speeds are faster if you setup a non-cloud private partition but those can only be accessed by guest accounts...also the WD cloud & drive software does not support the WD MyCloud Home so a lot of functionality is missing...It would be better is there was a way just to reconfigure it to be used as a NAS or if it could just stay connected with the WD software running.It did have a lot of storage for cheap and allowed me to make specific large project files stored on my home network available to my friends on the internet which was cool.It did set itself up without any hassle and appears as just a large drive shortcut pinned to the quick access menu.
5,excelente producto seguro y confiable.feliz con la compra
3,The usefulness of the software requires quick and easy access across the devices authorized.  The software has not be properly updated for Big Sur and requires a circuitous approach.  Previously a unique hard drive icon appeared on the desktop and access was simple and fast.  No more icon.  I contacted support about it however as with my previous experiences with support they provided little help. A major deficiency in their support system is that they can't log into your computer to see what you are talking about and the literature they refer you to seems out-of-date or just plain wrong.  In general I like Western Digital products and have several that I currently use.  Of course I also have a boxful of dead Western Digital drives so I plan to replace them every few years.  I should say that I really like the My Cloud Home concept.
2,Had to update software twice for continued operation over the years and now its a complete failure which I suspect is software too.
4,Lots of storage for a decent price. Not the easiest to use with PLEX but after a lot of trial and error it seems to be manageable. Makes some drive noises off and on but seems to settle down some time after using it for the day. Big drawback there is no user control panel for needed settings or making easy backups. WD could make a better product but for the cost it's ok. Hopefully the durability will hold up after time.
1,I purchased the MyCloud 4 TB to replace an Apple Time Machine for our Mac OS devices. It seemed like a solid compatible option. After some poor documentation troubles to get it set up finally got it working and it worked fine for a few months. One day my computer reported the device was disconnected. I check it and could hear the read/write head clunking around inside and knew the drive was a goner. It took FOREVER to work with customer support (chat email phone) to finally get an RMA to send the drive back. It was an infuriating process. FInally got the official RMA and they took MONTHS to recognize they had received the item even though my shipper confirmed it was received. Then it took MONTHS for them to finally ship the item even though I confirmed they had the device I needed in stock.Fast forward two months. I moved the drive to a new location in the house and when I plugged it back in not only did it not reconnect to the wifi it could not be seen on my network and like the previous drive I could hear the read/write head clunking around in the case. Doing research online these drives appear to be notorious for failures of this type. Now when I try to get an RMA with Western Digital I can't even bring up that option. Such a complete waste with a total lack of customer support or any attempt to manage expectations.
1,Im adding this update to my former review:Now I’m into MyCloud about 3 years. All of my photo over 40 years are on this thing but after last weeks update The Device is Off Line!I am locked out of my own MyCloud! I’ve tried everything unplugging replugging and hours on the phone with WD tech support and even tried to connect directly to my PC via an Ethernet cable. I’m still trying to process this… I am Locked Out! Now I’m going to look into some sort of data retrieval service. But Buyer Beware! This thing this MyCloud is a data death trap. The fact that you cannot connect via a usb chord is insane. I feel very helpless and stupid in the fact that I had concerns about it from the beginning but now the worst case scenario has come true. At this point I would much rather trust the cloud services of Apple Google Amazon etc than place my faith in a so called and promoted personal cloud that simply stops working.First Review:I’m still working with this unit and still evaluating it’s long term value. My collection of digital stuff music databases documents and photos has expanded over the years to consume several external hard drives. So I put everything on this 4 Terabytes mega drive. It’s kind of like filling a basement or attic how much of this stuff do you really need? But what it does well is allow you to collect all this stuff in one place wirelessly. It’s the wireless that is the blessing and the curse. It uploads via the My Cloud app all my photos from my iPhone. This is great just in case I want to see that sandwich and beer I had six months ago at that restaurant that seemed so cool at the time... the problem with the My Cloud Home is downloading in bulk back to my iPhone or iPad. I can only download one picture or one video at a time and this is very time consuming and a problem but only with Apple iOS products not my PC. So I’m hoping that they will improve the WD apps and the Files App. Also there is no hardwire access to the unit so everything is via WiFi. That’s good at home or away from home being to access it over WiFi but I wish it had both WiFi and wire and for this reason I will probably buy yet another external drive as my final solution.
2,Nobody reads the fine print. I did this time out of curiosity. But I had to open the box first (which voids any returns of the drive). So I open the box go through the set up and come to the privacy agreement that I must agree to in order to go further and I get the bad news. They want to use my activity for R&D (to improve their services) while China is mentioned a few times in there. Then I find out I CAN'T FORMAT the drive. Then I look more closely at other reviews to see how they solved this. Way too suspicious now and it's too late.
5,Does exactly as advertised and easy to set up.
4,Works pretty good except for 2 issues. Anything you put on it through the local network is not accessible to you when you access it from logging in so if you want it available to you when you are away from your home you have to log into it with your password like you do on your phone and put everything in that way. Also the app sucks. If can only save certain things like photos from your phone and you can only view them in chronological order of every picture under your login not by folder. So trying to find a certain picture can take alot of searching. You have to duplicate your data in several places to be able to access it easily from your computer and your phone. I have had no problem with the device itself It seems solid just the software is poorly designed. There are no settings at all and no admin page to change anything. It is what it is and you're not changing anything. WD needs to patch it with a UI and some adjustability.
4,This is a home device.  As a photographer I want to store my raw files as a backup and then have access to them as needed which I can do on my laptop or through the App and can share pre-publication images with customers for collaboration.  For the IT Techy folks no this is not a NAS.  NAS is something different; it is a device that is hardwired into a local network.  This device as advertised is Cloud SAN....a local backup with Cloud sharing and laptop and phone Apps so it is not intended to be used or operate like a NAS.  If you're looking for a NAS spend the extra $200 to $300 for a NAS device and do your own NAS coding and configuration.  Don't try to go cheap and then complain that it doesn't work just like a NAS.
4,Good product. Good value for storage capacity
1,I've owned many similar devices including others from WD and they get worse with every generation.  This RAID model is the worst yet.  I bought the device to have some mirrored storage for important files however unless you are a non-technical user with the most basic needs this device is not for you.Mine was restricted to be managed online only - either through creating an account on their MyCloud service or using your mobile apps.  Their various versions of documentation are ambiguous about whether you should be able to type the IP address of the device in a browser and access a device management application.  Mine cannot.  You can also cannot set a static IP address for this device.  Imagine "network attached storage" that you cannot manage on your own network!  Who thought of this?  In addition to all the other shortcomings mentioned in these reviews I will add that you also cannot attach an external drive to one of the USB ports and expect to browse and manage those files.  The device will recognize the USB drive but will only give you a message asking you if you want to copy all the files to/from the USB drive.  This can't be done with the Windows application (where the drive never is recognized) or using file explorer.  Even on the mobile app you will never  see any progress to tell you the file copy status.If you try really hard you can find how to enter a support ticket with WD (under category "Other device") but don't expect answers for several days.  When I finally did get an answer the support tech asked me for information that I included in original support request.  Thank goodness Amazon stands behind their customers on junk sold like this.
5,WD is discontinued some apps (Alexa Instagram and some cloud integration)  that was supported on devices release. Plex app needs some work (updated) Music playback works good with few disconnects. The WD home app is updated every few months. WD (app) would be great if it had timeline album wall feed to add comments as users add content.
3,It’s backing up my photos just fine I can’t seem to back up my phone or my computer onto it. I refuse to buy iCloud. I like my information right here at home.I really want to like it better.
5,This is a fast storage device. Though you cannot map a drive to it on a MAC or PC. It requires you to use their app to authenticate.  Cloud access is pretty seamless. Support was slow to answer questions. I was only able to get access by drive mappings (Guest) to a Public share on the root of the share. None of the other directories or shares are reachable without the app or cloud website.
3,This thing is great as a backup for a single PC but it is TERRIBLE if you were looking for a solution for multiple network PCs to access the files. Don't buy it if you're looking for a convenient storage for your family but it is an excellent solution if you just need some cheap network storage for a single PC.Also it was missing 500 gigabytes of storage so there is that.
2,After some difficulty I was able to get MyCloud to link to my mac.  I purchased it primarily to do automatic wireless back-ups but I have not been able to do that yet.  I noted a problem on their website and they show a phone image to "contact us" but there is no phone access to tech support.  I tried sending a question to their tech department from the website and after 4 days I got a response.  That took me to the next step and now I have another question I had to send to their support people because it  is not working properly yet.  They give the impression it almost sets itself up but I have found unclear instruction to be frustrating because I have had to go to their minimalist support service three times (so far).  If I can the device to work properly I think I will be very happy with it but I am finding it frustrating to get help from WD.
2,Overall this was pretty easy to set up and use.  The only glitch was I had an older My Cloud drive and during setup of the My Cloud Home device it asks if you have a previous My Cloud account which I had.  If you try to login you will not be able to input the new device activation code.  After calling WD it's because you need to register a new My Cloud HOME account.  So there are separate My Cloud Home and My Cloud accounts.  I wish they would clarify this during setup as it would have saved me 30 minutes trying to login.Also just be aware that 16TB is available but really it is 8TB in a RAID 1 configuration.  I guess you can switch to a RAID 0 somehow to get a full 16TB but I did not see that option in setup as it defaults to a RAID 1.  I wanted a RAID 1 anyways so this was not a problem for me.The USB ports are on the back which is an inconvenience.  And you can only use 1 USB port at time so why have 2?EDIT Update:  I had to RMA this after about 18 months - it sounds like one of the hard drives is failing making a loud whirring noise.  WD is replacing the unit under warranty which is fine but 18 months on a NAS hard drive is pretty short.  I'm looking to eventually replace this with a NAS 4-disk storage unit.  Also having to load my old data on the new unit is extremely slow!  For transferring large files speeds of 17 mb/sec are fine.  But smaller files like pics slows the speed to 3 mb/sec or less.  Transferring 3.5 TB is taking about 3-4 days.  And forget using the USB to transfer unit to unit.  Cannot be done.
3,Opened the box there’s no quick start guide when I purchased I new product just don’t know how I don’t have one
4,Easy to setup and use.Seems to transfer data quickly….much faster than my old Toshiba garbage device.The only thing I didn’t realize is you need to purchase backup software separately.  I had hoped to setup a scheduled backup for my computers but that feature is not available.  You can buy software for this function but not what I expected.
1,I used my old dead WD cloud device as a storage system for files to be played on Sonos. This is incompatible with Sonos except through one of their total crap 'service apps.'My old one connected in such a way that you could see all of the folders on it and quickly navigate to what you wanted and this one won't connect directly to Sonos at all and there is no way to fix this. Their Sonos service app loads incredibly slowly and when you finally do get it to load it does not let you use the folders on your device to quickly sort through and navigate to what you want.If I had understood that this would not work with Sonos in a reasonable manner I would never have bought it.Oh--they also intimate that you can stream videos from this to a smart TV. Guess what--YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THAT EITHER. The only way you might be able to get your TV to play video files stored on your My Cloud Home is to buy a separate piece of equipment sold by Western Digital and hardwire that between the My Cloud and a TV set. But there's no guarantee that will actually work the way they say it will either.I wish I had bought literally anything else. A toaster oven would have been a more effective file sharing device than this flammable paperweight.
4,So far so good. I’m about 2 weeks in.It’s set so anyone who has a login has their own portion so my wife can’t see my file and she can’t see mines. And we have friends who have access to it as well via the app. Barely used 200 Gigs yet. Thinking maybe I’m the future to add a 8TB version
3,El disco es fisicamente muy limpio y agradable tiene una aplicaciones para Mac/iOS que funciona bastante bien puede copiar de un disco duro antiguo mediante USB (Muy util) ademas de que puede acceder remotamente al disco desde fuera de casa pero no se puede hacer algo tan facil como compartir localmente el disco uso App llamada infuse (similar a Plex) para almacenar mis peliculas en el disco y compartirlas en red via streaming nunca pude hacer funcionar el disco localmente no habia como configurarlo en la aplicación sencillamente el disco no estaba en la red y si bien conseguí dar con él manualmente no se conectó porque no habian credenciales para hacerlo.
5,I ordered this then nearly canceled it because of the very negative reviews.But it works GREAT! It was easy to set up it up loaded nearly 20 GB of data that that I need access to when traveling in minutes. I have since up loaded a few other  files in the 20-30 GB range that went flawlessly. This works way better than the MyCloud I have its much more stable and very easy to use.I am puzzled by the negative reviews and wonder if the reviewers bought this for the wrong application.I need this to access a variety of files that I often need when on the road. I have tried carrying  portable drives and thumb drives I still do to a point  but this is real piece of mind to know that whatever happens I can access whatever I need via this sweetie! I am very pleased with it and based on my experiences and needs I highly recommend this
1,This product is a disaster.  It masquerades as a NAS but it is not one.  I picked this product because I thought it was part of the My Cloud line which is generally considered fairly decent.  It arrived today and I followed the setup instructions expecting to eventually get to some sane configuration options.  They never came.  So I started looking up how to access the options that I carefully made sure the device had before purchasing it only to find that My Cloud "Home" is a totally different product from My Cloud.  And even worse it turns out a lot of people have been duped by this.  WD's forum is filled with complaints about this product.  Many buyers consider this to be a disaster.  One person on the forum said he no longer helps people who have bought this product instead referring them directly to WD support because it is such a poor product.  Several people have suggested that this product was released half baked.  I picked WD because WD products are generally high quality.  Thanks for abusing my trust!I thought I was getting a My Cloud but now I discover that for some reason the only 4TB My Cloud available on Amazon is being sold at twice the retail value.  I was under this impression that this was just a different version of the same product.  I guess it makes sense now that this was marked down $40.  Unfortunately even with the discount it was not worth half what I paid for it.WD: Do you want to make this right?  This product is priced at $199.99 on your web site.  The real 4TB My Cloud is priced at $179.99.  You can restore my trust by contacting me and exchanging this for the real NAS and I won't even complain about the price difference.  I am packaging this back up right now.  Note that I just took apart my old homemade NAS so the longer you take the more annoyed I am going to be about not having access to my data!
5,Phone lost along with everything on it. Got this when I got my new phone. Now backup is automatically saved.  NO MORE LOST PICS!
5,Don't get scared by the bad reviews most of of them are people looking for high end products for their needs. The cloud home is perfect for the average consumer. You connect it to your router and download an app to your computer/ cellphone. Once installed it acts just as a connected external hard drive you have a folder for the hard drive and you can just drag files into it. The beauty of it is that you are not tethered to it and you can move your laptop freely without having anything connected to it. I would highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a basic external hard drive. This just takes it to the next level by making it wireless.
2,Dislike the fact that the device only works locally but not using the internet. That makes it an expensive attached memory with no internet access. Manufacturer stopped supporting internet access with no work around to my knowledge. Do not but this product. Some of their other products do still have internet access but not this one. What kind of a home cloud is acceptable without internet access. They say it is a security issue. So why not come up with a work around??
5,
5,There is not much not to like. I wish the documentation was better but you will be able to figure it soon enough. We are in about a month without a single problem. It does not have any installed security so I would install a VPN on your network. ( I would do that any way.)It is perfect for moving large video files from your phone even before you get home. Wonderfully handy! It is nice to have a piece of technology that actually works like it is supposed work.
1,This is not a NAS it cannot be managed or set up locally in your network. An online user account at WD is required just to get it started  to be managed and used. If you need a local storage device for your network stay away from this one. As far as I can understand theres no built in media server so you would have to pay for one in order to stream music or movies from your own storage unit to your devices within your own network. Utterly useless for what it is sold as.
3,El dispositivo funciona correctamente simple de instalar y configurar pero tiene un par de cosas deseables y que por ahora no tienen respuesta del fabricante. 1. La seguridad es básica y en mi caso alarmante!.. No puede ser que un disco duro con conexión directa a la red no disponga de mecanismos medianamente aceptables de seguridad incluido el cifrado de datos (para el acceso físico a los discos). 2. El ruido que hacen los discos es increíble. Es un dispositivo muy ruidoso y nunca para. Todo el tiempo está Indexando? o haciendo algo extraño.
1,Was functional for a bit using it to store work doc's and things while I hybrid work. Noticed it was off and got home to check it out. Loud fan sound unable to do anything with it. Called support. They said its dead after about 2 hours of holding and troubleshooting. I asked could i move the drive over to recover data they said no itll be bricked at this point. They can recover the data for 4-5k (was their estimate)
2,El disco muy malo en una actualización automatica dejó de funcionar ya no es posible verlo en la red no tiene ningún otro mecanismo para extraer la información. Perdí todos mis archivos. Tener precaución. No lo recomiendo.
1,The only reason I bought this product was so that I could upload video files directly from main PC and have them viewable across my network wherever I needed them without having to worry about USB drives or carrying a laptop or external drive everywhere. ... honestly that would have been easier  you cannot set up this drive as a media server you have to have the plex app  for that to work ( its provided so extra hoop to jump through) drive doesn't come with a usb/USB cord.  So you have to buy one separately but here's the kicker... you cannot transfer files directly.  So you have to resort to sending them over wifi or open internet.  The web app offers a way to upload and they have a PC program that auto uploads your files for ease.  However the PC app wont download on any of my PC's obviously due to an error on there in which leaves me only 1 options the web app.  The phone version is clunky and garbage but the standard  myhomecloud website isnt that bad its user friendly... here's where the real issue comes in.... I'm streaming hd media 3gig plus per file...  the upload site struggles to upload big files to about an hour per file  and the the site times out.  So unless you sit on top of the PC for hours at a time periodically clicking the page to make sure it doesn't time you out.  Your never going to get your files uploaded. I've been a westerndigital fan for years I have 10 separate drives for all manner of storage. This is single handedly the worse designed least user friendly product I've ever seen.  Waste of money in my opinion.  Good:  easy setup pretty much plug it in and sign up for an account and your good to go. I'm sure it works great for pictures and small text files.
1,I should have known it was trouble when setup was a nightmare. I had to reboot it multiple times just to get the setup software to find it. Same issue every time I plug it in.I backed up my data and saw the drive was near full great! A few weeks later the drive it backed up failed and when I went to use this drive to restore I noticed that even though the drive shows full there aren't any files. Cant access anything.This drive completely failed me when I needed it the most. Stay away find something else this ain't it.
5,Sirve perfecto para lo que lo necesitaba
2,My Cloud Home is a textbook example of a product whose software makes lots of assumptions about the user. If you match their profile great. If not... too bad.I was looking to replace an older Western Digital product that served as my household's network attached storage (for content we'd prefer not to tie up in the cloud). We needed a drive that mapped easily to Windows and Mac computers and ideally mobile devices too.My Cloud Home will do that... but to get there a user has to wade through a mobile-centric interface that frankly I found exhausting. On top of that once we finally got going the product made funny noises when accessing the drive. After about two weeks of back-and-forth with technical support trying to establish whether the noises were normal or not the unit is going back to Western Digital (Amazon's return window having closed while WD tech support was dithering) for replacement.I would not put my household through this again if given a choice.
3,Definitivamente el tiempo de la primera sincronización es excesivo. Al usar alternativas para respaldo tales como robocopy en windows o rsync para macOS la comunicación con el dispositivo se ve afectada. La aplicación se bloquea.
5,This is not perfect but among other solution in the market is the best.First of all PLEX sever works really good on this device and you can count on it.Second it can be good alternative for google photo but it doesn’t have advanced feature that google photo has like face recognition and ai search but you’ll enjoy its other features.Last you can totally trust and rely on this cloud storage fir your valuable data. Sharing and adding users are very easy and practical.
5,I bought this 8TB drive to replace the now defunct Apple Air Capsule. At present I have 5 machines making Time Machine backups to this one drive. It works like a charm. It has good speed and reliability. I am considering buying a second one so I have redundancy.It was easy to install and during the installation Time Machine was one of the options. Everything linked up without difficulties or the need to technical support.Highly recommended.
5,I was a little hesitant ordering since it was not brand new but I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.  It said that it had some scratches but it looks brand new. I purchased to transfer my movies and my pictures onto it so that I could save them that way and use them with my Apple tv.  it is taking a few days to get all of the transferring done and still working on transferring the pictures.  It was a great product for the price.  I would definitely purchase refurbished in the future.
4,I have similar experiences with WD stuff in the past.  The overall software implementation is uber proprietary and works satisfactorily by itself but doesn't provide a lot of integration capabilities with other devices/network equipment.
3,Easy to setup and the iOS & Win Apps work OK. But there seems to be no easy way to backup all the data you collect on this device. Without backups you are always 1 microsecond from disaster.
5,Our computer was full af pictures and music causing it running super slow. Only had about 800mb of storage left. Dumped all the photos and music onto this and freed up about 900gb now the computer runs better. Now we can access all the files from any computer the TV  tablets and phones from anywhere. The app is pretty user friendly and there are a few music apps for your android phone to stream your music library.
5,Works GREAT! It was easy to set up and load >1TB of movies pictures music documents. that that I need access to when traveling. This works way better than expected as just HHD drive storage. My Cloud is much more stable and very easy to use. Fast loading and fast accessing of data.I am confused by the negative reviews and wonder if the reviewers bought this for the wrong application or connected to the internet through some intermediate device like Vonage.Thank you Western Digital.
3,If you want a hard drive that remain online to be accessible from anywhere over internet you can get this one. But in addition to it if you want this drive to auto sync selective folders (whenever they change) this drive cannot do that. By auto sync I mean we cannot just mark a folder and ask our hardrive to keep a watch on it. Whenever a file inside that folder changes drive should sync it and store it. This drive does not support this feature and I certainly avoid getting this then.
1,Cuando compré este dispositivo mi idea era sustituir mi suscripción a One Drive la cual uso para guardar y accesar a mis archivos desde distintas computadoras dentro de mi propia casa.Tengo una conexión a Internet de 100/10 Megas y nunca tuve problemas con One Drive me funciona muy rápido y no me consume casi nada de recursos en mi computadora por lo cuál esperaba una experiencia similar con este dispositivo.Seguí todos los pasos y conecté el dispositivo a la red pero por alguna razón que no entiendo cada vez que tengo activo en mi computadora el software de este disco duro activo (WD DIscovery) mi computadora se pone super lenta o se traba y muchas veces tengo que reiniciar mi computadora para que vuelva a funcionar.He notado que cuando cierro el WD DIscovery mi computadora se vuelve a poner rápida.No se que le hace ese programa a mi computadora que la pone tan lenta hasta el punto que abrir o cerrar cualquier programa pude durar hasta 5 minutos o más. Esto es tan tedioso que decidí dejar de usar el dispositivoFue un desperdicio de dinero no lo recomiendo.No creo que sea culpa de las especificaciones de mi computadora ya que tiene unas especificaciones decentes entre ellas: Procesador i7 7700K 32GB ram Tarjeta de VIdeo Radeon 590 de 8GB Disco Duro de 4TB.
5,So I was watching a YouTuber (JesssFam) and she was sponsored by WD and used this external hard drive. About a week later I was trying to upload a ton of photos from my phone to make room for more (great job Apple) but I couldn’t because my surface ran out room (thanks Steam). I had been debating about getting an external hard drive for about a year and half. This happening was the deciding factor that I needed one I remembered the YouTube video and looked into it. I loved that I could link the My Cloud to my phone my surface and my MacBook! I can pull all my photos when people ask for them!! For example my brother asked me for a photo to prove that we got fake tattoos once and I was able to get it off my phone in minutes instead of having to open up my old 2012 MacBook. It is amazing and I would 10000000000000% recommended this!!!!
3,This is NOT an NAS drive no access via FTB software like FileZilla. You can't make a folder available to a bunch of people and have it show up on the phone app they need to know they have to look for shares in the shares section of the app.But the price wasn't bad and it dies respond much faster than the NAS McCloud drive
1,This device is recommended by WD as a replacement for an older device EX4 however it is stepping way backwards in technology. The unit is extremely slow to access on my own network and the no-help tech supports blames it on my 300mbps internet speed. Don't understand if I'm accessing files on my own gigabit network what does my ISP service has to do with it.. Terrible device and support
1,I was stunned how bad this is designed.  Start with the fact that it sits in your home but won't work unless it has an internet connection to WD. Why? Then there is no direct UI - you can't assign it a Static IP.  Then the webpage it gives you to manage (at WD - not a server on the device) is so limited in capability that you immediately want to download the desktop version. Well good luck with that - do a search - most people can't get past the 18% level of install.  After hours of research I found a work-around where I have to manually create directories on my PC for the installer.  After all that one STILL can't assign an IP address change the access passwords or do anything one purchases a NAS for.  Oh man what a stunning difference from their earlier great NAS products.  AVOID!!!!!!!
1,Like many has said you need to install a WD application to map a z: drive to access the files. You can't use a network share. One positive thing is that when you are on a laptop and you are traveling you have the files transparently available at z: similar to other Cloud drives.The bad news is that the drive uses a case sensitive file system like those on Linux. Normally you won't notice it until you try to install applications or use a command line to open files. If you created a file called 'My Document.txt' and you try to open the file by 'my document.txt' you get a 'file not found' error. This is unacceptable for Windows users. Lots of applications will not work when they are not careful in retaining the original file name in case. It also creates some weird behavior when you can see multiple versions of a file with different cases in the name in the cloud portal but back in Windows you see only one. You may accidentally work with the wrong one when using different variations of the file name.UPDATE: returned the product. When one of my Windows backup program (SyncBack) cannot see the Z: drive that is the end of it. I couldn't work with projects on the drive directly and I couldn't work with a local copy and sync my folder back to this WD Home thing. Talked to WD support via email and phone and they offered no help.I switched to "ASUSTOR AS3202T 2-Bay INTEL Quad-Core NAS". It has way more features (it has an app store!) and allow me to work with files via SMB shares. Plex app on it can do transcode without any buffering (WD Home constantly buffers). Asustor can even integrate with other network shares and cloud drives seamlessly.
1,I bought this because it had a built in PLEX Server. Sounded easy. Not really but okay got it all set up and finally working after some trouble but whatever. Hey guess what! Practically the next day got a free software update! Did I want this? No. Shut down the server COMPLETELY. WTF? Now I’m having to go back through the whole rigmarole again. Yeah my data’s still there but I’ve got to figure out how to get it going again. So screw WD. At least send an email about what you broke and how to fix it. Don’t just randomly break stuff in an “update” and expect me to drop everything to fix it. Maybe (like everyone else) I’m busy at the moment.
3,I used this for couple of week and found out there are attacks on this IP which is blocked by my firewall. Overall easy to set up explore sync your social media account like facebook instagram google photos etc. easy to copy your external HDD but you can't explore your external HDD using this. Simplistic and great app but not sure of security.
5,Plenty of room and allows me to keep my laptop clean
4,Excellent network hard drive if you don't mind your information on the internet.Sets up easily and quickly.Definitely designed to be an internet device.Suggest a password with at least 12 characters that don't repeat.
1,Sometimes I interpret negative reviews as being from non-technical people getting bad results because of not understanding the product they are using.BELIEVE EVERYONE'S NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE HERE!Every day I try to use this astoundingly incompetent device I marvel that a company with the reputation of WD produced it. It isn't that the thing doesn't work at all. It just has so many quirks and limitations and it is so inflexible in how it works and is frankly unstable and unreliable in ways that anyone attempting to do anything the least bit serious will find chronically maddening. It seems to have an unknown but preset limit of the sizes and number of files allowed in a batch (for example). It does not seem to play with any standard protocol (like smb/cifs). The documentation is sketchy. If I manage to sign in and get my computer to save some files to it the next time I try to connect (even when I haven't logged off of my Windows 10 account) it is disconnected and requiring me to type the user name and password.If I can't send it back I may try to keep it and use it for something. Though I may decide to send it to an early grave or cannibalize it and perhaps use the drives in a home-built NAS... It really is less than useless because to get it to appear
3,The My Cloud takes your mobile devices' photos and videos and makes them accessible on all devices anywhere. It does that well.It is not designed as a way to access all of your computer files from anywhere. I was hoping to use it to back up my computer and to make those files usable from other devices. While it is kind of possible to do this other solutions are better for that purpose.
1,I am very unhappy with this product.  I will be sending it back.  I bought the home cloud because I was running out of space on both of my laptops.  So Bingo I can buy the Cloud home send all my files there and then clear up space on my laptop after the files are safely on my cloud home.  So after spending many hours sending files over ( about 2 days since it was slow and I have many files ) I deleted them off my laptops.  To make space.  Sadly not knowing the outcome.  When I deleted the files from my laptops the files also get deleted from my cloud.  So this device is now just an item sitting around.  I also was not aware this was a used product when I bought it.  If that was the case I would not have even bought it.  Another downfall I have to have it plugged in directly to my router.  Lost many files wasted my time and energy with this device.  Highly NOT recommended.
5,I had over 12k photos and videos and they were uploaded within minutes. I would recommend to clear photos from your phone before uploading because once connected everything is going in storage. Oh and what I love is that I don’t have to connect the hardrive to my computer 😁 I will do it directly with the internet and from your phone 📱
3,We have discovered that this device is getting regular hacking attacks coming from the internet. Updating the software did not help. It’s certainly easy to set up but I’m getting tired of constantly rebooting after hacking attempts.
1,There is very little that is positive to say about this device or the MyCloud service. The device can ONLY be used in conjunction with a wireless router. There is no ability to interface with the device through a USB connection to a computer (even though it has a USB port). Even a router can be interfaced with through computer! All network functionalities are exceptionally slow - regardless of whether they are done on a wired or wireless connection. The device is solely managed by the MyCloud app or website - and the desktop app is horrific. Transfers are completely handled over the network there is no option for manual transfers. The device DOES NOT SUPPORT FTP. There is NO RECYCLING BIN feature and the upload client does not know how to handle duplicates - it will simply create endless copies of the same file or folder. What an absolute joke – and none of this is clearly stated on the product page. Neither the hardware nor the app do anything that they are designed to do *well*. The only thing nice about this product is the server's aesthetic appeal; the physical device is very chic (although both the desktop app and website interface look archaic - although the mobile app is not much worse than other mobile cloud apps).
5,Gracias
3,This product is not DLNA enabled.  There is no way to enable it.  You will need to use a thrid party app (Plex) in order for your Smart TV Bluray or network connected Stereo to see this drive on the network.  In my case I am not be able to add apps to my Stereo.  Therefore I had to send it back. On the other side of the equation while my initial engagement with Technical Support was a little sketchy their follow-up email got things back on the right track.  I was not too terribly impressed with their documentation or online help but it was ok.  I will only add that I did like the WD Discovery software after I understood it.  It installed and allow you to right click on files and send link to share them with friends.  This product was worth the money but the absence of DLNA was a deal breaker for me.
1,I had purchased this drive mostly as a system for music backup. It is very slow to transfer files even when I tried connecting it directly via an ethernet cable to the router. I now just use a Google Drive subscription. WD provides some bundled software tools such as "WD Drive Utilities" but these don't even recognize the drive. After hours of trying to find tech support online all that I found were other frustrated users who were facing similar issues.
5,Alot of the people have complained saying this device is not a NAS. It is you need to create and account and then download the desketop version and everything will connect. The desktop version is much more user friendly it took 2 tries to download it for both computers. The mycloud web browser is good for on the go backing up and mobile phone pictures but is not ideal. Install the desktop version for the best interface. Great product.
1,I got this to support Time Machine for my Mac.  Twice firmware broke the service and without telling us- after a month of troubleshooting it magically comes back with a firmware update- TWICE.  Now they announced that with this firmware update they will remove serious features people have come to depend on.  And you can't log into the device directly- you have to use the cloud app to control the device on your own network; The point of the device is to keep everything local- and now proving that you're not in control as of 5/23/22 they are announcing turning off features remotely- and too bad for you.AVOID THIS.  Get anything else.  Last WD NAS like device I ever get and my company won't be buying from them either.
5,el producto es bueno para almacenar  pero tenia mas expectativas de backup de Mac OS y iPhone..la velocidad de copia no es la esperada
1,This personal cloud storage requires a login to the Western Digital website in order to function.  This totally negates the promise of "personal" storage.  WD will also update the software whenever they feel like it.  I regret my purchase.
5,Super easy to setup will need to have its wired direct to your modem or wifi router. I use large files in a GIS program and in Illustrator and saving and loading is seamless.
1,way to freaking slow! My network is ALL set for 1gbs and this thing will not upload at more than 15mbs a sec. most of the time the speed was even measured in KBS.Don't waste your time on this and just get a better NAS system.
2,What I really wanted was a NAS that I could set up Windows mapped drives on and use as a file server.  I had accomplished this on my two of the older "My Cloud" NAS devices.  The "My Cloud Home" series a only permits this on the built in "Public" share.  If you create any custom shares they can only be mapped (as drive "Z:") for use with the "WD Discovery" app.  The "My Cloud Home" product line is designed for basic users who just want a mirror.  I did map the "Public" share in File Explorer.  It works but it's not what I wanted.  It's also very slow.  I'm running a home network on CAT5 cable not WiFi.
1,Despite all of the comments on ease of setting up this unit it is not.  My son who works in the IT industry was at our house to set it up. He has this very unit from WD and had problems (with his unit) with several units which were sent back before he got a unit to operate appropriately.  I should have taken that as a clue.We had problems from the start. Our computers would not recognize the drive. We tried everything. My son contacted their tech service group which provided absolutely no help. We’ll give it one more try but suspect this unit will be returned. Really disappointed.UPDATED COMMENTS:Since WD Customer Service was worthless I spent considerable time reviewing WD My Home community site. First of all I purchased this unit from Amazon on March 12 2021 and received the first generation unit. That is surprising since I think Gen 2 came out in 2018. Further in the community site users have stated that “My Cloud is not recognized when connected to AT&T Uverse Pace Arris Uber or Sonic Gateway routers.  There appears to be a work around with a certain switch but this should be listed somewhere on there site and in Amazon information listing.
5,I’ve only had this drive for a very short time and so far I’ve been pretty happy with it it’s doing what I needed to do I’ve heard some poor reviews about this thing because people have higher expectations but if you know what you’re getting and what you need it for and you know how to use it it actually works wonderful if you get something and you expect more out of it of course you’re going to be unhappy so once again I’ve been pretty happy with it setting it up was very easy and I don’t have the best bandwidth for Internet and that it’s even working pretty good with
1,Bought this a couple years ago and I've spent more time fighting both WD tech support and Asturion than actually using my storage. It's extremely frustrating that one has to buy something to only deal with people who dont care about your personal things being lost. I managed to upload just under a TB of information before the product just stopped working and ever since then it's been WD accessing my computer remotely and Asturion lying to me multiple times. I'm a Graphic Designer and a photographer on the side with hundreds and thousands of files events of people's weddings who I can't finish editing their pictures because they're stuck on the cloud and nobody can do anything. WD solution for their faulty product is to go elsewhere and have my data recovered (all quotes have been north of $700dlls) and then they'll take a look at to see what they can do. Asturion has promised twice to return my money and it's been over 6 months and I still dont see anything. I've talked to multiple managers on both WD and Asturion and nothing gets fully resolved. I hate leaving reviews especially bad ones as I dont feel it's fair to scare off people but this is ridiculous and honestly do not think it's right for it to be in Amazon. This is by far the worst of the worst experiences I've ever had purchasing anything on Amazon and I've been a member since 2010.
2,Very difficult to setup.  I still can't get it to work.
3,I got this to replace a Synology drive because I liked the sound of the WD cloud features (which it turns out are a bit clunky).  The MyCloud is WAY TOO SLOW and drops on and off my home network- night and day to my experience with the Synology.  Almost unusable for my photography workflow.  Going back to Synology and going to relegate the MyCloud to a backup drive.
1,I've had a WD My Cloud for years. I decided to add a My Cloud Home for the sharing features. I've had it for almost 2 years. About 6 months ago the drive took over our network and caused it to crash. Unsure what was happening we replaced our entire network and modem. Finally we figured out if the My Cloud Home was connected the wifi network crashed (yes no local wifi) and we had no internet connection. I could and still can access the drive but we can't access anything else.It ran great for over a year prior. I have no idea what happened. Did an update automatically happen and cause it to go wonky? I tried posting help on their forums but got no reply. I know from past experience customer service is a joke and quite frankly if something like this can happen I don't really want to fix it or replace it. I plan to hit it with a sledgehammer once I get all of the data off. I used 87 GB of my 4TB. What a waste.The only way to get the data off is via the internet interface or with it plugged into my router. I can't directly connect it to my computer to either diagnose or remove data and it must have internet in order to function at all. That means anything I want to do to diagnose the stupid drive can't be done. Also all updates happen automatically so I can't even force an update in case that's the issue. All-in-all a complete waste of money and time.
4,Access times on the network seem to be damn slow... I have a decent speed lan network that I keep isolated from the external ISP upstream access... and still takes seriously 2-3 minutes to get access to larger files. Not even transferring them  but literally access the directories. Large image in thumbnails also is painfully slow. Likewise in Windows 10 I've had a few bugs where the device loses all connection and the client application WD-Discovery. Despite this it's still a great device and allows sharing throughout...Doesn't work through a VPN connection though
1,I have three other WD NAS drives (Twonky MyBookLive & WDMyCloud) and a Seagate PersonalCloud on my network with media files spread among them.  I can see these drives on my pc's smart tv's tablets and phone.  Plex media server plays my 2d movies on my smart tv because it can see my drives.  For my vr media Oculus and Skybox sees my network dives so all I have to do is browse to the network location of my vr files and click on the file to view it with my headset.I bought the 8TB MyCloud Home thinking no problem I'll move my VR media to the new drive and that will free up loads of space across my other drives.  Bad move!  Skybox does not seem to be supported so MyCloud Home does not exist in a Skybox world.  I downloaded PlexVR to my phone and logged in.  I enabled PlexVR in MyCloud Home and Plex sees the drive.  But it won't play the media properly.  Plex says to add a bit of script in each file name to get it to play properly.  REALLY?!!  Just play the da%#n file!  Is that too much to ask?  If I ask for support WD will say it's a Plex problem and Plex will say it's a WD problem.Bottom line - if you have an NAS for media or series of them working avoid the MyCloud Home.  It doesn't play well with others.  I guess I'll have a look at Seagate.  Hopefully they won't piss me off like WD has done.
3,I am a techie so take this with a grain of salt. In the word they have over simplified how to operate with this thing.After playing with this thing for about 2 days I was never able to figure out how you access the same data you access from the internet as you do the local network. If you are a techie stay away from the home version. It is basically designed to be as simple as possible without the flexibility.I could not deal with the lack of flexibility so I returned the product after a week. I have evaluated the regular MyCloud for my sister and it suits her just fine for her needs.  Didn't really distinguish between the home and the regular version on their website. If I had known I would have bought the regular version in the first place.
3,Cool concept but the app needs some upgrades to make it easy to use. Right now you basically have the option to either sync every single photo in your phone (no thanks) or individually select photos. If they ever add the option to auto-sync specific folders my photos will finally be stored correctly.
1,I made a grave error before buying this device.  Had I checked the WD MyCloud support page I would have seen the many posts about this device losing network connection after a few minutes being online.  The web interface remains operational but the NIC is a worthless.  And I have several devices on my network (including a synology NAS) which all remain connected to the network.  But unless I reboot the device and my workstation it will not stay connected.  If you are looking for a network enabled device to back up your files and pictures .... this is NOT the device.  I'm probably packing it up and returning it to Amazon tomorrow.  There are much better backup devices out there.  DON'T buy this one.  I made that error.
1,I went to transfer my photo collection to this drive and it transferred at about 12 to 300 kb/s MAX.  That's right.  SUUUUPER SLOW.  There is no way to turn off the re-indexing and thumbnail creation.  So if you are transferring a picture to this drive it takes 2 to 3 seconds for each file.  The user interface gives VERY LITTLE options to change anything except the name and RAID type.  You can only change setting through the Website.  No direct connecting to this Drive at all.  This Expensive CLOUD ONLY NAS should NOT be called a NAS.  You cannot map to it directly.  You have to use the WD software that will map a drive for you but this drive is NOT Visible to most programs.  It isn't a true NAS drive.  You cannot use it as a backup for Windows File history either.  After researching my issue for days(When I finally had the time) It is too late to return this Hunk of Junk that is only good for Backing Up My Phone for the Next 4 years till it's EOL or has a hard drive failure.  I should have done my research Before hand.  This was an Expensive Mistake!  I will probably salvage the drives and put them in a TRUE NAS.
1,Setup and installation for this this was annoying at best. Western Digital has some weird naming schemes so finding the correct guides and support was very difficult.If I want to store files using windows it takes forever. Transfer speed is similar to old dialup. Even uploading text files was taking way too long.They have another option you can connect through the MyCloud website which kinda defeats the purpose of this because if I wanted to use the internet to backup my files I'd just use one of the many other services around and needed to connect through their servers is sketch AF. Uploading the files this way is quite a bit faster but still way slower than I'd expect. Right now I am transferring 38515 files and about 2k files have transferred over the past 30 minutes to an hour so hopefully it'll be done by tomorrow.This product is a hard pass and I really wish I would have returned it when I noticed how terrible it is.
1,Wanted to use this as a NAS for my Apple TV but it failed to work properly.  Upgraded to a synology which was the right choice in hindsight
5,I have a ton of video content and having a way to stream it to my devices was crucial. This gives me that option whether it's my phone tablet tv or laptop. East access with a lot of cool features to share content. Only problem I have is that I do not have enough room!
5,Shockingly I got this running in five minutes.  I set TimeMachine to backup my iMac hard drive and it worked fine.  I had a little snag setting up my second computer via WiFi but I called customer support and they explained that I needed to log out of the first computer as you can't set up two computers on the main account.  Once I logged out of the first computer I was able to download the software on the second computer.  I (with tech support) could not get TimeMachine to run on the second computer but I can get the sync feature to work so I'm okay with that.  My second computer is Only OS 10.11 so that might be the reason that I can't get TimeMachine to recognize the Icloud Drive.
4,Todo funciona muy bien el problema es que cuando ingreso a través de otra red en otra provincia se hace lento ingresar a las carpetas mediante my cloud home descktop sin embargo sigue siendo útil por que te permite acceder toda la información donde quieras.La copia de archivos sigue siendo muy lento 10 mb/s aproximadamente.saludos de Lima.
1,I bought this to back up my computer wirelessly at home - to have a "Home Cloud". You have to use a utility on your desktop or phone. When you drag and drop a folder structure onto the "cloud" the structure copies over but all the folders are empty. Thus you have to drag and drop all the files for each folder into the folder. Tech support was abysmal. They couldn't help and told me that's just how the product works.  She said the best thing to do was get a USB drive and copy data from my computer to the My Cloud using the USB drive.
1,Gee I wasted 3 hours of my life trying to get this device to work and on the phone with WD support. I explained what I wanted to do from the start but after spending 2 hours on the phone the WD tech finally came back telling me that it is not a NAS device?!?!?  It is only a Cloud device. What a waste. Hopefully I have saved someone some time. I won't even get into how I couldn't understand the foreign tech and he couldn't understand me. Quit doing biz with these companies that can't provide clear English-speaking techs for USA support. Multi-billion dollar companies that can't figure this out. Of course that is why they hire these people - they don't want your support calls in the first place.
4,The app has a pretty lame interface and can be very slow. But I bought this in a desperate situation and it served my immediate needs quite well. I would recommend this as a start but for the long run doing a bit more research and creativity to find a more sophisticated device is recommended.
3,I was originally impressed with the my cloud home drive for easy of use and set up. However after spending more time using the drive it lacks certain features I would expected to be included. This would be ability to create multiple accounts and share files without having to go through a stupid HTTP link which in my opinion compromises security. The feature should be similar to google drive where the user can add to their own drive. Another point is the poor backup options. I have tried numerous back up tools like Arconis which is not able to detect the my cloud user account as a source for backup. Besides that the plex feature works well enough for 2-3 devices. If those two issues where addressed via an update I would give the drive 5 stars.
3,The documentation did not say that this product was difficult to impossible to make work with a Mac. Should be  a straight forward thing-"it is compatible here's how you do it" or "It's not compatible wrong product." I tried but could not figure it out. Fortunately  I bought it from Amazon so the return was covered by Amazon's policy. Manufacturer policy states it will only replace product. Great!
5,Saw some negative reviews and got a little scared but finally decided to buy one when it went on sale. It is exactly what I needed. It automatically backs up all the photos that I take on my phone without me having to do anything it has great storage for all the files I need backed up and it is accessible from anywhere through the internet. Couldn't have asked for a better product.
3,I'm not swayed by the disproportionate 1-star reviews that complain about it not being a NAS device.  NAS devices are pretty clear about what they are and most of these non-NAS home network solutions rely on perpetual internet connections to work so there weren't any surprises here save one: the My Cloud Home app is not compatible with my Asus C302-CA Chromebook which is my default on-the-go laptop.  This was the only area I didn't research ahead of time and having to find an alternate solution for it is a major disappointment.  That aside the read/write/sync speeds are admirable and a good value for a 4TB sku.
4,Can be used locally with windows network I found that you can use an IP scanner on your local network and you'll find the devices IP.then you can use command prompt to ping -a (IP address) this will tell you the actual DNS name for the device something like mycloud-sd6tftYou can then map a drive to \\mycloud-sd6tft\publicThe device will always be set to DHCP I don't think that can be changed but this access method works fine.
2,If you are looking at this to back up your computer more than just a few family photos it sucks. It's not an external hard drive and it's not a NAS and your computer won't recognize it like either one. If you have an online backup service you can NOT back this up on it like you can a normal external hard drive (or a NAS) because it doesn't actually dock in the system.Not to mention it is SLOW. It takes me about 20-30 mins to pull a 1GB file from it. In comparison it takes MAYBE 5 mins usually less for me to download the same file from my online backup service. I thought being able to access my files from anywhere would be great but at this speed it's pointless.The direct transfer speed from an external hard drive plugged into the MyCloud is pretty impressive it's the downloading them back from it that takes forever.Phone back-up seems to work great. So if you just plan on using it to back up your photos and music from your devices it probably works well. If you wanted it to store larger files and have remote access to them don't waste your money. Just go straight to a NAS setup.
4,It was slow to upload info from our devices but it seems to be doing it's job.
3,WD advertises this as an alternative to backing up your photos to Dropbox or Google Drive and honestly that's about all it's good for. If you actually care about your data privacy miss this cheap toy and invest in a real NAS.
3,I don’t like the beeping sound that seems random
5,This was the best way to break away from paying for cloud storage. It was really easy to setup the hard drive. Ease of use came in the app guidance. I have had no connectivity issues and uploading files and backing up pictures has been very easy. I definitely recommend. Don't waste your money on monthly cloud subscriptions for a mere 100 gigs. Get yourself your own cloud with terabytes of space.
1,So — after leaving a glowing 5 star review the other day (and mocking those "whiners" who were knocking this drive for Macs/Timemachine) I'm forced to admit I was wrong.  First 24 hours things worked great.And then — the problems set in.Timemachine repeatedly failed to find the drive on the network. Backups failed. Trying to set things up properly was a conga line of frustrating steps. Having to deal with a crappy app. WD support blaming MacOs. if MacOs is so problematic why are you promoting this drive as a perfect solution for Mac owners?I really tried to make it work but then i realized that this product was billed as being dirt-simple to set up and use. Why am I paying to be miserable? So back it goes. If this drive is working for you I'm happy for you. But it has really soured me on WD. They know this drive/setup has issues with Macs and still promote it as a solution.
5,I should have purchased this years ago.  This is perfect for storaging & sharing files to many different computers and cell phones.  Easy to setup easy to install software on computer and cell phone.  Highly recommanded.  I install my hard drive wired cat5 patch cable next to my internet router.
5,Works great and desktop interface much improved; only downside was when the unit’s power supply failed after one week WD support was going to charge me shipping and handling to replace the defective unit - luckily Amazon replaced it for free (no shipping or handling charges) - replacement unit has been working perfectly for months now
4,I think it’s a great product I do think the price should be a little lower. It does what I need though.
5,Very excellent. Windows 10 worked. Very easy setup with features. Suggest buy new router modem and wires upgrades. It will work and smooth easy to setup for few minutes. If you have windows out of update old router and modem will hard to setup and waste your time. Save your money pay a monthly cloud. Your own cloud and free.
1,I have not had mine very long recently I'm changing jobs and backed my computer up to this drive 2 days later I get my new computer and the drive wont come online so I am unable to access all my backup. Everything I've worked for is gone because I trusted this piece o crap.
3,Good basic intro level NAS if you want very basic function with limited features.  I sent this back and went with the WD My Cloud EX2 Ultra which has more features and flexibility (but is more complex than the My Cloud Home).  For me this My Cloud Home was too limited (cannot access other account folders or set permissions as an administrator) and the EX2 version was a better fit.
1,I purchased this drive to replace another WD MyCloud drive that I've had for YEARS and never had issues with but will no longer be supported by WD. This drive is PAINFULLY slow. It took me three DAYS to copy a little over 2T from my old device to this one and that's because the drive kept putting itself to sleep while doing the file transfer - I had to keep restarting it.Once everything was transferred over and the stupid new "software" that had to be installed on my machine to recognize it as a network drive I began to notice performance issues when accessing the drive: not writing files from other software without multiple fail/try again slow to load folder contents even after indexing and CONSTANTLY sleeping. Just so frustrating. I'm going to an external had drive that is cheaper faster and has TWICE the capacity. Western Digital FAILED on this "upgrade."
1,Intended to use with an Apple Airport Extreme to in effect get a Time Capsule storage backup capability with Cloud access.ONE PIECE OF ELECTRONIC NIGHTMARE. DO NOT BUY.  Everything from product registration to  use is a new version Dante's Hell. Load of caveats with confusing updates and dis qualifiers.  All I really want is a backup up hard drive. Waited too long to get Amazon return option.
5,Been using it for a couple months now. Works well
1,Purchased new end of October 2021 for a NAS for my new MacBook Pro. Setup was slightly difficult as it did not want to work with Apple TimeMachine. Finally got that worked out after about 3 hours it ran fine for a few weeks then would not connect to TimeMachine so had to set it up again. Ran fine to about new years when it quit responding all together. Would not power on would not work in any way shape or for. WD support issued an RMA after jumping through hoops and charging me a shipping fee. It has now been almost three months waiting on them to return my repaired drive. At this point I have given up hope and will seek a different solution.
2,After several months using this it has been seriously disappointing for the price tag.  The connection drops several times a week and the reading/writing is so slow as to make this nearly worthless.  I use this as a means of sharing files needed throughout my house.  It can take over an hour to unzip any archive.  Saving a file it dropped connection midsave and a crucial file was deleted in the process causing 10 hours of redesign work to get it back and in place.  I would return it if I could instead I will be selling privately and setting up a Raspberry Pi NAS.
4,I use it as a video server. While the transfer speeds are slower than my mycloud the streaming is great and the capacity is wonderful. The update to stream my music library is a great addition.
5,Works great & connected to home network with little to no issues. I was uploading my different cloud storages that I've had throughout the years & have managed to get everything sync'ed. I'm still trying to get the plugins to work well or trying to figure out if there's any relevant content even on there. The Plex media server is a great feature but is somewhat difficult to get set up correctly. If you have a nice movie collection it's a great tool to use to stream to every device in your house; once you buy the Plex Pass. The DUO seems nice too having a redundant hard drive storing all my (once someone else's) cloud information right in my home.
3,Caution!!!Not the wonderful WD Mycloud. Mycloud home does not have traditional web interface of Mycloud generation 1 or generation 2.  User has no control for fixed IP on busy home networks!  No SMB interface for linux sharing!!  Unit has nothing in common with previous WD Mycloud products. No user control over local backup on Usb drive. End of a great product.  I have owned and used 6 different tradional product which I loved. Supply of previous product has disappeared.Extremely limited use with apps loaded on Android or windows.  Still has a non user network interface limited sharing options. Gave up and returned Product.
4,No hay soporte técnico la página es mala
5,This my cloud is just what I needed for my small business. And I love the fact I can assist it on the go.
1,I order this because my son recommended it.  He uses two at his business and the run great.  I use a Mac and every project contains an iMovie project and high depth video.  The drive does not handle the iMovie file Extention ".imovielibrary".  Every time I try to copy a file to the MyCloud drive is stops at the ".imovielibrary" extension and I receive an error that states the file is locked.  I check and the file is not locked.  If I am transferring several files and it stops on the one file extension the whole transfer quits. I am then left sorting out which files were not transferred.The other issue I have is that the finder's search option does not work.  Because it does not work for my business it has become a glorified storage unit for pictures.  Can you imagine trying to find a picture among 4000 pictures without being able to search them by name?From what I know none of these issues occur on a PC and everything works fine.  But for a Mac which handles lots of videos it is a no go.
5,Excelente
4,La compatibilidad con Mac bo es buena
1,I have several Western Digital NAS drives from the My Book to the My Cloud for backing up multiple computers. It was time to buy another NAS drive. The My Book and My Cloud drives are no longer being sold. I bought this product the similarly named My Cloud Home. That was a mistake.The My Cloud Home has limitations that do not allow it to be used as a standard NAS. As the name implies this is geared toward a home user with little to no networking knowledge. Using the My Cloud Home requires an online account. The name assigned to the drive can be changed on WD's web app but it cannot be changed on the network. The Domain name cannot be changed from WORKGROUP. It does not allow you to set up user accounts beyond the Public account.For increased security Internet access is disabled on my older My Book and My Cloud devices. The My Cloud Home requires an internet connection available at all times.This may work okay if all you want is cloud storage. Do not expect it to work well as a backup drive.
5,Love that I know everything I do is being backed up easily!
3,I just ran into the same problem as the first review.  I was expecting two 8 TB drives.  I seem to be missing 4 TB worth of storage space.  I just logged on to see what i bought and read the other review.  I thought I was getting 8 TB worth of storage for what i paid.  I was planing on buying a single drive 8 TB and ended up with the dual thinking i was getting the same thing.  Turns out that was not the case.  The set up has been easy so far but i'm a little upset that the size was not clearly labeled by WD.
5,This device was easy to install working with 4 computers.  Just sits there quietly working and storing large files for the system.  Very happy so far.
5,It’s very cost effective device I use it very extensively and it reduced my cloud dependency and of course the cut much of the costs that is related to it very easy to use
1,I have owned 5 or 6 of the original My Book devices and two of the second generation my cloud devices and I purchased this to replaced a failed my book.  What a mistake this is not a NAS at all there is no setup for Network Firmware uploads or downloads it does not go into a sleep mode to extend the life and save energy.  there is no diagnostics for the drive or email notifications for reboots firmware installs or errors.  I had to pay amazon 12.99 to have UPS come to my house and pick it up for a return that was money well spent.  You cannot configure shares permissions or admin accounts for access.  I guess if you trust Western Digital by accessing it and your data over the Internet given the hack that was done with current devices and current Western Digital Software the last few months this is the product for you.
3,I am replacing and old NAS and want the same functionality. This is not a NAS it is a personal cloud. I set it up and found it works great for mobile devices but so-so for network drives. If you want a true NAS that allows you to map drives properly back up the NAS to another network drive and stream media without issue do not get this. If you are millennial and are looking for a personal cloud for your mobile devices this is the device for you. I gave this 3 stars for that because it does that very well. Otherwise get a true NAS.
3,Product works fine. Disappointed that it requires special software to run in order to access on desktop. Wiil not work on a 32 bit machine.
1,I bought this drive to use with my Chromebook but even though there is an app on the Chrome store  I could see the files on the WD drive but could not choose which app to open them with. Not very useful.The first drive died in less than one year. I got a replacement after paying a $115 deposit and $25 fee.The second drive died in one day. It looked like it might have been refurbished. All of my data is on my second drive and I can't access it. WD wants me to pay a third party to recover the data. At least they didn't charge me another $115 deposit plus a non refundable $25
3,This should have been an upgrade to the Mybook Live but this is a poor substitute. At least I was able to open file in mybooklive the app for mycloud doesn’t allow you to open some files. I have no way to listen to my files offline it it isn’t supported by the app. The capacity is great but what the point of I can’t access ALL file types??
5,This works much better than the prior generation one I had and I got it as an Amazon warehouse deal (open box) for around half off. My phone and computers are all backed up and I don't fear losing my work. As a teacher building a library of resources reliable data storage is key.
4,Doesn’t disappoint! Connection thru wife is great!
1,I knew before purchasing the item that there were certain limitations with this NAS. Setting up the drive was pretty straightforward. Basically plug in the power and plug in the network cable. You have to set up an account with WD and then download and install the network discovery software on each computer that will be accessing the drive. Once you install the software the drive will automatically show up in Windows file explorer or finder on Mac. The issue I had was the ability to access media files once they were copied onto the drive.  I copied a few 1 gb video files onto the drive and was unable to play them back on my computer without stuttering and stopping. I tried 3 different computers in the home 2 of which have a wired connection to the network and still no luck. In addition to that the drive caused the entire network to slow down. I also have an older version of the original WD My Cloud that has been working fine. I accessed the same files from the old WD my cloud and they played fine. I will be returning the new My Cloud Home unfortunately it was a big let down.
4,It was really easy to setup but it was not as easy to access compared to the older models as it is not setup like a shared drive on the home network but on the cloud server instead. Had to email tech support to find out how to stream my videos onto the smart tv. Needed to install Plex media.
5,Very easy installation has software features that allow you to backup cloud accounts on Google Drive Dropbox and OneDrive and keep them synched. I bought the 3TB Duo version. It is possible to shut the drive down through mobile app or logged into webpage but restart must be done by touching a small button on the back of the drive. There is an Alexa skil in beta. I enable it but could only get drive status With spoken commands it did not find content (.m4a) in specific folders. Hopefully the final version will work correctly. When I sent a problem report the tech guys kept asking for screen prints.. that's difficult for a spoken command :)
2,This is my 5th WD "NAS" device but it isn't a NAS as advertised.  I'm giving it 2 stars only because it's 8TB for the price it is but barely.  None of the options available on my other 4 NASs are available with this "NAS" so much so I'm wondering how they get to call this a NAS.  I need to have static IPs and I only have a Windows PC for emergencies everything is on Linux which isn't native.  I'm probably going to end up returning this unless I find some remedies.
3,File transfer speeds range from 70 MBPS to 7.  Mostly 7 across the LAN.  File transfers hang.  Estimated time to copy is measured in days.  Suggest you look elsewhere
4,Works great but noisy
2,You are not able to access the drive directly through your own network.  You need to go through their host network which means you constantly receive bottlenecks and slow speed.  A 300 meg folder can take 10 minutes to open.  Most of our image files are between 2 and 40 mbs  Previewing images is stressful and extremely time consuming.  Most of the time we transfer images to each other on a thumb drive.  The Cloud is strictly for archiving data.
5,Good little network drive.  Just have to know to install the program to have it show up as a Network Drive instead of a Cloud Drive.  Must faster that way.
2,The actual device capacity for storing my files was 3.5TB or 12.5% less than expected. I was told during a chat with WD's tech. support that this is by design and that the missing space is used for "firmware storage" (go figure). Also the only supported Windows 10 backup software for a My Cloud device is Microsoft's File History which has limited functionality or a version of Acronis TrueImage provided by WD neither of which do what standard 3rd party backup programs do. I'm sticking with regular external disks for my backups and a VPN for remote access to my LAN which amount to more functionality than what a My Cloud device offers.
2,Had high hopes but was dissapointed.  Returning it backPros- All in product- Good Pricepoint if you get a discountCons- SW is EXTREMELY limited in capaiblity- If you have 10000 photos in various folders it jumbles them up into one giant mess- No easy / granular way to restrict access by users- Only filter option is by date- User account setup and permissions very limitedThis is good for simple auto backups ... not for a true NAS setup
2,The hard drive itself works fine but it constantly disconnects from Plex.  Have to restart it at least twice a day. Gets old. Prolly never gonna buy another one.
3,Pros- high capacity accessible by Internet from anywhere as long as network.Cons- very slow uploads and access.  App is limited to pictures and videos. Not all formats.Personally expected more from this company and this generation of device.
5,This is a replacement unit for a My Cloud unit which was 3 years old and was no longer able to access it outside my home network. The set up is quite simple and WD packed a lot of features into this unit. However they have so many variations of this product that their documentation is very generic as they tried to address a number of products with a generic set of instructions. Furthermore the desktop app comes with apps that do not work for the y Cloud Home devices. Why would anyone release apps that are not intended to be used with this mode is beyond me.
2,Like many others my my book live got hacked and erased and thought this was a replacement.It is not the same need to use plex to get dlna to work but if you have trouble they say they do not support third party apps.I did get it to work with plex but it is not what i wanted i will use it till I find something that works the way I like.
2,This product is bizarrely crippled by the manufacturer. Even though it has a USB port you cannot connect it directly to a computer to access the drive. The drive must be able to access the internet in order to function. For a variety of applications this is a critical problem. Tech support will not help as apparently there’s no way to bypass this limitation.For Apple Time Machine use it makes the drive a nonstarter. Apple will not support and address software issues with Time Machine on network drives unless the drive can be directly connected.
1,I bought this drive to use exclusive with Plex I was under the understanding that my cloud home was an upgrade to my cloud and it is not.  WD advertises that Plex can be used and it can but terribly.  To use plex server you sacrifice over half your Plex membership features your load times are super slow and most importantly if you buy the 8tb version for some reason you lose 1tb for software or whatever it is it thinks it needs.1tb of storage? yup and I'm still dumbfounded on why any drive thinks it needs 1tb of space.I would have taken this back or sent it back but by the time I loaded 5tb of videos and got Plex setup it was like 3 weeks and my return time was up.  My WD  cloud is so much better faster and should have bought another one.  I'm very disappointed and would never ever recommend this to anyone using it for Plex or want speed or even don't want to lose 1tb of storage you paid for.
5,Have not needed tech support so far for my cloud home. So far no issues that are mentioned in other reviews. Works better than expected for what I use it for. Would give 5 stars but tech support and WiFi signal are not applicable
1,I purchased this item to replace my old MyBookLive drive.  It took little time to discover that it is NOT the same thing.  Western Digital really pooped the bed with this unit.  I cannot open a shared database stored on the drive nor will Windows recognize it to back up to.  In fact all one CAN do with it is to copy—not back up—files to it for storage.  What good is that?  I expect to be able to WORK on the drive not just admire it like a bookshelf filled with expensive books one has never read.  It went back the next day and I have ordered a "wireless external disk" which Inshallah will function like my old MyBookLive.  To Western Digital you really blew it on this one!
2,The drive access is VERY slow or at least the network connection is very slow.  As in often I just give up waiting.  In any case I am quite disappointed with the following:  Access speed flexibility of naming cell phone auto-backup directories customer support third-party issues (on WD's end) leading to multi-day outages of password server and hence access to the drive.The desktop sync feature does work well as a near real-time running backup.
1,The old cloud drive you could locally manage and static IP.  Create share folder so you can browse from your internal network.  This new version forces you to use there app and seem to be made for the less technical user wanting to backup there phone.  This thing is a huge disappointment because I have used WD for years.....Well I guess i have to fork out a little more money for a Synology or a Qnap.
1,Do not buy the WD MyCloud Home product. All the functionality that made the MyCloud product line great has been removed in the MyCloud Home product line. The only way to access this drive is by creating an account at mycloud.com. You cannot access it via ftp or telnet. It has no user interface for setting up the drive creating user accounts restricting permissions or anything else. WD wants you to populate the drive at Internet speeds by passing your files through their website mycloud.com which is a nonstarter. You can load files onto the drive by copying them with the Windows File Manager or the Mac Finder. That will take weeks. You cannot populate the drive quickly with a utility like rsync.
1,i have been ordering western digital storage devices for a while now.  This is the first time I have received an item that was completely useless as soon as i pulled it out of the box.  I don't buy an item so i can immediately go online to tech support to get it to work.  I will never again purchase a Western digital hard drive.  This has been so utterly frustrating for me.  I live and work in a foreign country.  It has been hell to get any type of tech support for this item.  Those who purchase just be aware.....
1,I purchased this as a backup storage for my phone and my laptop somewhat hybrid cloud. interface is well designed but very limited and reliability sucks. worked for a month and i have been fighting with WD to get a replacement for over 6 months. first they told me i didn't have an RMA then i sent them a copy of the RMA they sent me and now they just haven't responded to any emails. I sent the device in (you have to pay for return shipping so not only am i out the money for this crappy device i had to pay almost 40 dollars to ship this piece of crap back to them. Now I just get ignored. I wish there was something Amazon could do but they tell me i have to deal with the manufacturer. DO NOT BUY.
5,Bought this to have a back of a back up and pull photos from anywhere. It is much slower than I would have liked but worked well. 2 days to write 2TB using a usb hard drive attached. Overall I am happy with it. Will probably get a second here soon since this one is almost full.
1,This product is useless. It stops working after few weeks. I spent multiple hours and days to upload data from various sources. After few weeks there was a software update and device became offline. I rebooted reset and tried all troubleshooting steps but the device is shown as offline from both the app and web url. Now I can’t access the data anymore. WD tech support says that the only option is to return the device. This issue happened with 2nd device. Now I am not even sure if data from the device is deleted or not before returning the device as I can’t access the device anymore as it shows as offline. Even when it was working fine copy of a TB of data from another hard drive was very slow - It only copied 50GB of data in a week and was work in progress even when I used a USB to copy data. I will never buy this product again.
3,This is easy to set up but I'm still fighting with it to make it more user friendly. Tech support is more of a pain than helpful. Good storage but I think a jump drive is easier to use. This has to many rules cant make changes to saved files and then save it back to cloud. Have to have another medium. Also didnt like that I have to log on via the internet when the drive is hooked to my private hub.
5,Bought this My cloud during Amazon Prime Sale. Been using for 4 months now. Works as expected and I dont see any problems with it. It is very useful for sharing files within all connected devices at home and external network.
3,The problem is that one cannot map it as a drive to back-up with an app such as Acronis True Image.  It is good for storage only.
4,My grandson had to help set it up
3,Can’t get it to back up my Apple computers.
5,We bought the smaller version 5 years ago for the office.  We bought this one for home.  It is extremely easy to setup and to use.  Follow directions and you will have no issue.
1,I have had this cloud for 13 months and it started having trouble about 2 weeks ago.  Thing just started shutting off and rebooting every few minutes.  then in the process of trying to get it to work again my hardrive got erased.  I have tried to re sync my files back on there and re backup my phone pics but it has not worked well.  Hardrive is a lame duck now. Will barely connect and backup my phone pics and still has not fully synced my files and pics from my computer.  More often then not it wont even let me sign into it and when it does it will tell me there is nothing on it and then it will all of a sudden show me the files which will take forever to load one thing. Its garbage. I am going to contact the manufacture to get this thing exchanged but I have no confidence in this product that it wont happen again so I will buy something else.  Oh and I have tried tech support and they were pretty useless as well.
1,I bought this to replace my old MyCloud device which had died. This is NOT a replacement. It is a cloud storage that happens to be sitting in your home. Zero local access available. I am returning it...
4,Very good products  but some JPEG file can’t see the photo in view  ( say file not support ) and music file like mp3 only can store in cloud but can’t play in cloud  this mean you need to download to your devices if you want to play ..
2,First and foremost I love WD. I have a couple drives and they are fantastic. But the design of this product is NOT what it is marketed as. The fact that I cannot view all folders on the device when I am the owner of it it absolutely ridiculous and a horrible design flaw. What is the point of a family shared drive that I cannot access the files stored by my family members? I share a folder to my wife (who is a user on my device) and it does not get added to her account and she cannot access it via the app. This is all possible with a regular MyCloud but the Home it is not? I really hope i’m Missing something or else someone needs to reconsider their role at WD. This is absolutely pathetic and infuriating that this simple feature is not available on an expensive product like this.
5,Easy installation. I have two computers two mobile phones an iPad and a Surface Pro all interfacing. No problem using the drive on any of them. I have not used all available tools yet but so far so good.I am eliminating all online cloud services.
3,You are paying for 4 TB of storage for example but you actually only get 3.5 TB of usable space...  Ripoff !!WD touts a simple setup "right out of the box"...  There is NOTHING simple about the setup....I'm debating whether or not to return mine to Amazon for a refund....I have owned an Iomega Personal Cloud device for years and it was much more simple to use although it is now outdated and not compatible with Windows 10 64bit....
3,Loses WiFi connection often. Difficult set up instructions. When working correctly it is great to access my files from anywhere in the world. Mobile app works very well. Have to reboot often.
2,This is not a NAS! I can’t access anything by its folders only by WD’s arbitrary and capricious search terms. Those terms are not capable of dealing with classical music - is the artist the performer or the composer?I have multi disk recording in a folder but WD won’t allow me to access them that way - it’s a random hodge podge - garbage.Unless WD allows me to organize my collection the way I want to MyCloud Home is just an abortion.
4,it came poorly packaged though. All they did was slap a label on the box that the device comes in. It made it to me fine but after seeing how it was packaged I am surprised no one stole it.
5,Easy to setup and use. Easy access from PC MAC and iPhones
1,The product stopped working after two days. Worked with tech support online for several days and the result was the product was defective and should be returned. The tech support was online due to the long wait time to talk to a real person. Most of the support was referring to online information that I had already tried. I gave the tech support a low rating due to the response time of the retuning chat 4-6 hours later I was busy with something else by then (work ...). So what could have been a 20 minute conversation took days. Also WD return policy was poor (I was paying in either option) Thankfully I bought through Amazon with such an easy/ great return policy. I am going to try a different company for my next attempt based on research ( I don’t think the error should have happened in such a base product and the tech support)
5,Sirve mucho es tener tu propio servidor en casa. Toda la información de laptop y teléfonos en la nube y disponible siempre. Funciona perfecto y es de fácil instalación.
5,Purchased for my wife due to too many pictures on her phone and three different cloud services she was using now she has all the pictures in one place no more hunting through different cloud services
2,The "12 TB" size has 2x 6 TB WD Red HDD.  In small print on the box it admits this.  A NAS should be advertised as the storage space in redundant RAID who would use RAID 0 on a NAS...
2,It works ok as a picture backup and some file storage but the idiots deleted the media server function of the older systems and it won’t work if your internet is down! Wtf!
1,Get it out of the box. the site it sends you to in order to download drivers is now domain squatted. Take 30 minutes fiddling with it set it up. It's fine.Do not try to read and write to it at the same time or it will bog down. Will randomly disappear from your wifi network. Good stuff.Want to have a second computer access it? Have fun mapping a network drive . The whole point of me paying $150 for this thing instead of slamming some hard drives into a server is so I don't have to do things like map a drive. In 2020. Because Windows changed some stuff so rather than releasing a patch that's the best route to go.I've been a Western Digital customer for a very long time. Since the mid 90s. I'll be giving my business to Seagate now. This thing is a piece of garbage.
4,Does not give good feedback back for estimated length of time on how long a large backup will take.
5,There are too many data breeches and don't want to add another $5 expense for the rest of my life.  This cloud was set up and everything backed up in about 2 hours.  Everyone in my family has a partition folder.  Great to access my stuff while I'm at work or away from home.  Easy app added to phone device or link on browser.You are crazy NOT to control your own data and own your own cloud.
1,Unless you are a networking wizard do not buy this to use for Mac's Time Machine!!!!
4,Backs up phone and computer automatically. Don't need to worry about losing files if computer crashes.  Makes accessing my files remotely quick and easy. Can be physically stored safe location miles away with no notable delay in file retrieval speed.
2,I've used MyCloud products for years having a MyCloud Mirror that has served me well. I needed to upgrade capacity and decided to try the newer MyCloud Home. I expected the same excellent performance and reliability.Unfortunately my experience with MyCloud Home has been nothing close to expectations. I've had problems with speed with simple copy operations slowing down my 2019 MacBook Pro with a 1 GbE wired connector. Some of my copy operations would stall and fail to complete. I would try the same actions on the older MyCloud Mirror with the same network topology without any performance impact nor failures.Stick with a traditional NAS.
1,Horrible experience. Ongoing issues endless drive activity issues...the most recent issue is the drive makes a horrible grinding noise. Never been dropped or bumped. Just started making horrible sounds out of the blue after a year of use. I do not recommend these drives.
4,Works great however I am not too happy it uses Plex ($4.99 to unlock feature) and not iTunes for music streaming. I read it’s an upcoming feature but haven’t really found solid information on it. Would be 5 stars if it supported iTunes like the older My Cloud drives.
1,The cloud does not properly back up your photos from an Iphone (11 or 12).  It makes copies but it makes lots of copies - like 100 photos turn into a 1000!  Then it's impossible to use.  I thought it would back up the photos and be easier to access them.  Not so!  I reverted back to using the ICLOUD.  Initially WD was very supportive and said they would fix it.  Now they stopped answering my emails.
2,The product itself is great. What was not great with this particular package was that it came with an international AC adapter that would not change. I would have returned it to Amazon but I was under a deadline. The package I got said something like "Made in Brazil." If you buy this product make sure it comes from the USA. I ended up buying a new one at Best Buy to meet the deadline. The  product is great. Not the AC adapter in the one I got.
4,Works kind of well. I use it for PLEX but support content is Confusing as WD has competing products with similar names many helps and reviews actually are for the other product. PLEX support for 4TB of content is strained.
3,Works fine but has security issues and no good way to confirm the latest firmware is installed.
5,Very easy to setup a brand I’ve trusted for years. Would highly recommend for someone who wants to save space in their iCloud !
3,Some features only work from internet browser. Doesn't respond as fast when searching for files or pictures. I have 300mb download and 20mb upload. Wish it would be faster and better at organization of pictures. Share feature is something they can work on. Gives access to the file or picture but unable to edit. Maybe more time spent with it and I can give it more stars
5,I bought this to set up a Plex player. Took no time at all and works great.
3,It's slow transfering files from computer.
5,Connected to the network and can not access any file from any computer.  This is a huge help.
5,Good productEasy set upBacked up photos from multiple mobile devicesFast
1,Do not get it! I gave it a shot but ooooohhh my good I regret every Fri day don't expect it to work as a regular NAS you have to download their horrible app and it will update automatically without even letting you have any control. The disk is painfully slow!!! no matter what they claim. Every time you upload ANYTHING to it it will index it and take forever so that you have nice pictures of THOUSANDS of electronic diagrams (in my case). I tried to return it but the "window closed" save your money for something more useful maybe Halloween socks that would be better spent.I run 8 NAS in my network from raspberry pi to pogoplug to lacie etc. All of them outperform this disk by a high mark even a cheap raspberry pi is 10 times faster AND you will have control over the behavior of it. This product is for monkeys who don't know how to turn on a PC.. and need a brick to throw!.
3,Need a recycling bin!!!
5,Wow so easy to install. The app is so simple to use and bonus it is a good plex server. I ripped all of my DVDs and BlueRays and compressed them to format mkv H.264. By doing this I have more than 300 movies and tv shows in my Cloud Home and now I have them with me anywhere in the world with me. Just as a plex server struggles with subtitles and can comfortably do two streams at the same time.
5,Wanted to share files on two computers at work as well as my laptop at home. Quick setup and works everywhere!
1,It is a beautiful piece of hardware but it's too hard to figure out how to use for a Time Machine backup.  I was at it for a couple hours yesterday and a couple more today.  They can refer you to their several various documents on the Internet that are too complex.  Apple's Time Capsule could be frustrating but the beauty of it was the simplicity of doing back-ups.  I've figured out that I have to do it as a guest on the MyCloudHome and it put a folder on it "TimeMachineBackup" but then it says that "Time Machine couldn't back up to "MyCloud-myserialnumber.local".  I look through the various reviews on Amazon.com and I am envious of the many people that have gotten it to work for them.  Seems to be a 50-50 bet and I ended up on the losing side.
1,I was quoted $1500 for data recovery. Not worth it.
5,Muy fácil de configurar y utilizar. Estoy centralizando la información que tengo dispersa en varias memorias usb en HDD y en nubes. Con las dos primeras ha sido muy fácil con la ultima aún no he intentado. Realmente vale la pena.
1,I read all the reviews and spent hours researching my NAS purchase but despite my best efforts I clearly made the wrong choice. This device is buggy has a clunky interface and is “no longer eligible for customer service support.” WD has discontinued any help on this device whatsoever meaning any issues and you are on your own to figure it out. On top of that this drive is incredibly loud (didn’t know that was a thing) AND is virtually impossible to backup as the rear USB port only allows for input data no export (makes sense. No it doesn’t).  My words of advise are BUY SOMETHING ELSE.
1,Your internet service provider router likely will see this as a security threat and will block any updates neededthere is no way around this and WD customer service is essentially garbage there is no side load or local update override so whichever security patches you get when it shows up is all you'll ever get essentially useless as a NAS even for local networked computers in your own house ignore the inability to use remotely or via mobile bc every device needs 8ts own login and sharing files doesn't work. If you want to share between users you have to copy duplicate files to the other users profile using admin login.Utter waste of money
1,Being a savvy tech user I ordered 2 of these for Christmas for backups for my family. I got them and tried setting them up according to directions. Directions seemed really easy! Plug in turn on and then connect! It was not at all that simple. Followed all troubleshooting steps up to resetting the device. When I got to reset I held the button for 60 seconds per instruction. I waited over an hour for the flashing to stop but it was still flashing fast which support said that means it’s defective. By the way there is only one white led and you have to tell the difference between flashes like slow fast or heartbeat. I bought 2 so I figured there was an issue with one. Plugged in the other and went through setup. Same thing flashing fast saying it was defective. I emailed support describing my steps and they verified I had 2 defective units. It’s sad when a company can’t even make new drives that come to the end user and work. They asked me to return them. I will not purchase WD ever again.
5,Good storage for price pretty easy setup have not found a “shuffle” player to randomize music tracks on the device that works yet so this is only good for full albums. Still am happy with the purchase.
1,Not a NAS device or home cloud.. Cannot be managed locally. Cannot be assigned a static IP address netmask DNS etc. I am sending this back. I wish that I had read the user reviews prior to purchasing but I have owned several WD NAS drives before and never imagined that WD would intentionally take these sorts of drives in a different direction.I did copy another review because it was dead on accurate.I can't manage my wife and family photos for them. My wife takes hundreds of photos and video but she needs help organizing.When they fix this I will change my rating. This is the last time I trust WD. We cancelled our order at my company as well.
1,This device is not directly accessible like other WD NAS storage.  You cannot access it via an IP address on your network.  You have to install their "app" on your computer and it then maps the drive via the app.What a disappointment from WD.  I am returning it as fast as I can and looking at Seagate NAS drives.The My Cloud Home devices are not the same as the My Cloud devices.  I have a My Cloud EX4100 RAID drive and have not issues using it as a network addressed device.  The "HOME" designation means you have to use their cloud server to even install the drive on your system.
1,Bought this drive only as a time machine drive and it does not work with it since they updated the software (it used to work fine) This is the worst! DO. NOT. BUY!!
1,It may be worthwhile on a PC but the software is so dumbed down of the Mac version that 90% of all help peages found on WD's website DO NOT APPLY!The software is written by a bunch of Window's geeks who have little regard to making this drive user friendly for Mac users.  The back-up purposes that it focuses on are almost all things that are covered by your MacOS and which are totally useless on a Mac.The one thing that I bought it for was to have a replacement drive for  Time Machine.  It that's your purpose DO NOT waste your money on this.  You WILL become very frustrated that it cannot do anything right in that regard.I've been the tech support for several teams for over 30 years and I've just wasted over three hours of my time trying to get this to back up my Mac and it still doesn't work.  It should not be bought for any Apply devices.
1,This is not a true NAS.  This is not accessible via SMB you have to install a different app to use it.  If you are purchasing to replace a MY Cloud OS 3 device go with a Synology or another vender that doesn't totally wreck the software.
1,Using many WD personal storage/cloud products before I never had any issues and always felt very comfortable using their OS. But all that changed after receiving My Cloud Home Duo 16TB. I was assigned a very highly visible and time sensitive project by the CEO of my company and was also given a budget to purchase any tools that I needed. Even after reading many negative Amazon reviews about this product I still went ahead and bought this unit. After making all the connections and powering on the unit I was not able to connect to the web interface nor via the mobile interface. After spending a couple of hours trying out different things I ended up calling the WD help support desk to learn that it is a defective piece I am not sure if this Amazon Seller is selling refurbished pieces or not as pointed out by others in their reviews but now I have to go through all this trouble to find a different solution/tool to get my project completed on time.
5,I recommend this product to all techies/non techies to use it as a centralized storage for all documents/photos/videos. I am able to access the docs using mobile app and mount the drive as NAS dive and it can be accessed at any time from my computer.
1,this thing is SOOOO slow.  Can barely transfer a 30 MB file some days.  Tech support sucks and after 10 months has not been of any help.  I even paid a local IT company to get this working faster and they can not do anything because the speed relies on the Mycloud servers.  And... of course even though the device is on my desktop right next to my computer I still can't transfer a 30 MB file today.  Don't waste your time and money folks get a real server or get cloud space from apple or dropbox.
2,It can work for Apple's Time Machine but it requires extra steps not explained in the manual.  You need to reach out to WD to install some extra software.  This was disappointing for me.
1,I've owned a MY Cloud NAS drive for several years and found it easy to use and hands free to automatically maintain a backup of my home PC.  That drive is starting to fail so I thought it was time to replace it with a newer model.BIG MISTAKE!  The My Cloud HOME simply does not work as a Home PC backup device.  It's unaddressable on your home network and has no software to support automatic backup.The advertised picture showing Sync capability is fraudulent vaporware does not exist.When I contacted Tech Support I was told the My Cloud HOME was designed for Mobile devices.Really?  Who needs 6TB of storage to backup a phone that has 64GB of storage??I can't believe a large company like this with a long running successful product could screw up so badly.
5,It’s nice to keep all my small business files safe and secure and easy to share With everyone in the office
1,Worked for less than a month then went offline and could not get it back customer support is a joke since they know about the problem. they gave me the run around and never fixed the problem. WD knows off the issue while support asks me questions like is my internet working duh i am talking and sending screenshots to you. After a 30 min runaround no clear solution and a web site which also has no clear solutions. On top of that Amazon seems to want to make getting a replacement or other brand difficult when trying to return it.
5,Great product for the price and sure beats those monthly charges for  loud stoage.
4,like the drive wish it was more versatile like moving files from Mac to it n finder
1,I had a previous version of the wd my cloud I mapped it to my computer as a network drive.  I just tried to do the same thing... they don't let you... you have to access it through the app... total junk!  returning it immediately!
1,There are a tremendous amount of complaints about how slow this drive is - so slow in fact that it's virtually unusable for the task.  Transferring a bunch of small files like music is completely useless.  I zip all them up and it takes 2 hours to transfer a single 10GB file.You can't just attach it with a USB to a computer or even ethernet.  Supposedly it's possible but it's not easy and I wasn't able to do it.  And I'm pretty tech-savvy.I should have just bought a USB drive.  This thing is a paper weight.  Didn't put it through its paces and now I'm past the return window. I'm going to trash it - I get 100X the transfer speed between pc's on my home network.
1,If you want to have a complete system backup option do not purchase.  Although the utilities appear as downloads in the WD Discovery app they do NOT work with the Home Duo.
1,Bought it after seeing so many negative reviews I told myself if it has even a single issue within the 3 month return period I am returning it. Spent the first-week copying about 2TB over to the drive then it went permanently offline. I immediately go about putting in for my money back from Amazon. I am curious to see if I can get back into it thought so following the usual googling I hear it is a common problem and could not find any solution that worked for me. I end up hard resetting it by holding the reset button in the back with a paperclip for 60 seconds this did reset the hardware however it is STILL undiscoverable by the network the hardware and my MyCloud account both say it is 'offline'.TL:DR -- Absolute trash waste of money avoid.
5,Tech support helped me set up the My Cloud Home and I am very happy with it.
5,Installed software setup was quick and without issues.  PC connected to the device across the net with no issues.  Performance is excellent very fast for the price point.
1,Do Not Buy  WD products their customer service is the worst ! besides that I purchased the (WD 4TB My Cloud Home Personal Cloud) in Jan 2021 and it already stopped working. I made several attempts trying to contact customer service with no actual success  I was finally chatting with an agent and making some progress when they stopped typing so I closed out the chat reopened it just to find that they closed for the day. Not cool ! Its like dealing with a company that just got started and doesn't have the needed resources. Stay away from this company its an absolute waste of time. Now I have to send it off for data recovery ...... Like I have time for that !
3,I was hoping to use this as a NAS behind a network switch not enough ports on my modem/router.  My router has only four ports one for my PC one for my security DVR and two ports going to switches for cameras TVs Rokus etc.
5,Very Easy to use on a Home Network via LAN and home router. Not a Full feature NAS which cost 2-3 times more to run Plex etc Much Faster that my 5 yr old WD My Book 2 TB. Typical 900mb per sec(90MB) transfer vs 300 mb. Poor security if facing the internet. Not for Business or Enterprise network use.  Great for home use.would buy again...
1,This is a waste of money. I had this BARELY 6 months and already it died on me. It's frustrating as hell. I had another WD before this so you'd think I'd have learned my lesson when THAT one died on me but I guess it takes me awhile to learn. DON'T BUY WD!!! IF I DECIDE to go this route in the future I'll pay the extra money for something hopefully a little more dependable!PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY! DON'T BUY WD!! As I said this is the 2nd one that has died on me!
1,The devices works ok from a mobile device if all you want to store is photos. Tech support says the mobile app update is coming but no date as to when that will be. And currently there is not way to manually install the latest firmware update on the device. The new update will probably be nice by allowing users to create photo albums within the mobile app and hopefully store documents on the My Cloud Home as well. But as of now you can only save documents to the cloud device from the web app on a computer. The other down side is you can’t transfer your albums saved on your device. And when you are able to create a new album (after software update) you will have to manually select each photo (or all photos from one date) in order to move them to an album on the cloud device.  I’m going to return this for a NAS that can do what I want now.
1,I tried many different wireless drives and NAS and I've never had such a horrible experience as the one with WD My Cloud. The main culprit is their software: it uses a lot of CPUs and you cannot connect directly to the drive in any other way. Furthermore every time a new version of Mac OS is released it'll take them 5-6 months before they update their software. Until then update the software you're left with an unusable drive since you can only connect to the public directory. Any other directory where you saved files before will be unaccessible until they finally decide to update their crappy software.
5,This was easy to set up and is easy to use.  We use it to keep our larger files such as pictures music and recipes.  We are able to give our family access thru an app so they can see the family pictures as well.  Helps share with ease.  Also with the app we are able to access the files from our phones from anywhere
1,**BIG** difference from the old NAS.Good: all your local files are proxied by their hosted service which allows you to get access to the contents of your stuff when you are not local.  (if one person needs to use this and they want access to their data off site then this isn't too bad... but why not just use BOX or something?)BAD: (LOTS!)  Lost all ability to setup shares.  can't create RW shares for you which are also RO for others.  Can't setup admin access to oversee mgmt of all shares.  have to have a special app on your device to access the data on the NAS.  can mount a cif's volume directly but it's NOT the same as what you can access from the app share.  the cif's share volume is completely unmanaged (no user auth or controls).can't log in directly to the device (and no local root capabilities).Can't do NFS can't have a static IP.  (no again with the no-local-admin).
3,This product need to be researched before purchasing. I have had many NAS products and this one falls below the bar for NAS usage. The description needs to be revised. It may be perfect for some people however I can't recommend this for even the noobie user. Spend a little more and get a real network attached storage device.
1,This drive was easy to set up and worked for three years. Unfortunately just long enough to accumulate a lot of our photos from our mobil devices. Then total failure. First indication you might receive is that it’s offline. User efforts to restore it failed. Contact with their customer service was a complete disappointment. Their advice was nothing more than most users would have already performed. Hopefully I can find a local repair service to retrieve our data. Very disappointed in This drive and it’s manufacturer. Definitely will not purchase another WD product.
4,Working good so far seems very nice software is easy to find and install and each system and mobile device can be backed up easily
1,If you are Computer Literate you will not want this NAS. Not only do they require you to install their Software to access your private (Password protected) files after it maps the network drive which you cant recreate it also requires internet to get to your private files... Sure you can \\IPADDRESS but it will only show you the public files. There is no web interface you can go into to change settings all that is done through the software or WD site. I verified all this with WD Tech Support they said "This Is By Design". I will never buy another Cloud Home as it is ridiculous that you have to jump through this many hoops just to view your data.Update: The software will randomly glitch disconnecting you from your device not to mention the auto updates that I have disabled will do them anyway disconnecting you till it rebuilds your drive... Whatever that means to mad to look it up... Irritation is putting it mildly...
1,I didn't realize until months after I purchased this that it was explicitly designed to work with WDs servers. I set it up as a basic storage drive and it worked okay but as soon as I wanted to access its settings and make sure it wasn't open to the general internet (since WDs devices have been wiped remotely by hackers recently) I found that I can only access the drive by creating a WD account and then accessing it through their website. I've also read that the thing will cease functioning after a brief period if it loses access to WDs servers. "Take back control of your files" indeed.
5,I plugged it in downloaded and installed the app did the set-up provided in the instructions and was up and running within a very short period of time. We set up a separate account in the unit for my wife and she too was up and running with no glitches. Remote access via cell connection works perfectly. The My Cloud Home Duo works exactly as advertised. I am very happy with this unit.
1,I bought this in March 2020.  It is now May.  It showed offline a couple of weeks ago.  I have worked to get it back online by visiting their product support website.  I have done everything that was asked and the cloud will not go online.  I just spent an hour with  Tech support and the are unable to do a hard reset on it even or access my data on this cloud.  Everything I have saved on it I will lose and will be gone forever.  Not what I was looking for in a cloud.This cloud is not worth it for even a basic user like myself or even someone who is more advanced.  If there is no way to access the data you have saved on it even without the internet this is no worth the almost 200 I spent on it.
5,Works very well so far... Seems like a very inexpensive method to have your own cloud
3,Not recommended this unit requires internet connection to setup no way to use it locally on LAN only this device has to be exposed to WD servers in order to function. Previous generation of WD My Cloud was way better as it was ready to be used in offline mode on LAN only.
1,I had to juggle four different interfaces on three devices to get everything installed and configured. When I finally went to play my media via Plex I got an error message that *many* have received and few have resolved. Maybe it will be fixed in the next update of Plex... and broken in the one after. Also didn't work on Plex for Tivo; and I was too late to try it on my PS3. My TV and PS3 don't recognize it as a media server so it's basically useless if it won't stream through PLEX. Hours out of my life and I'm returning it.
4,Easy to use although when it comes to  music not much.You have to play with third party providers .Not quite what we expected.But works fine.
5,Awesome product it’s the best
5,I am enjoying my new WD Cloud  Saves me time.  I don't have to copy my music library from one computer to another.  Very happy with my purchase
1,you need multiple accounts.  One for support and one for access to the device.  annoying.Half the time when logging in it tells me there is no device and then the other half lets me log in without a problem.  What is up with that ?Rather difficult to share things on it.  There is no space in this device to put files so others can Download then edit and put back up.  So it's not a very useful device for collaboration.  It's just a glorified netword access disk drive and one that unnecessarily complicates sharing of files.  You could just email a file to your peers better!!I would NOT buy anything like this (at least from WD) again.  Update:  Did I mention that I threw it out ?  Yep.  tossed it 'cause it was useless.
4,Love WD hard drives but had to drop 1 star as these might be more powerful compared to the old My Cloud drives but they are a lot less flexible.
2,This is probably the slowest NAS drive I have ever used.  Slower than my portable drive plugged into my router.  It takes literally weeks to upload a couple terabytes of data.  The interface is also very inconvenient.  In order to load any content your PC/Tablet etc. has to be logged in through the WD Website.  On top of that it is consistently repeatedly logging out.  If you have this on a remote PC with automatic backups be prepared to check it every few days to re-log into the drive.  It's crazy I may as will just do manual backups.
1,I returned this due to is utter disappointment you would think by 2021 there would be more stable options for personal retail inexpensive in person cloud storage devices but this the only one I'm familiar with. It thoroughly disrupted my home wifi mesh network and upon trying to login the second time the device wouldn't recognize my password and it requires you to create an account with WD servers but even though when I did the forgot password option it showed the password was active but it wouldn't work via chrome. Once you use a password and have this issue if you don't want to use a different password the system refuses to allow you to reuse a password.
4,It works and does what I needit to do  I can access my video and pictures from anywhere and so can my friends and family
5,WD has been proven to be really reliable.Over the years I have owned many brands of HDD and I must say that I have never had a WD drive failed on me.This enclosure comes with two WD RED Drive and it is easy to setup and it works great.The only con is that when the drives are in use they are a bit noisy and worth mentioning.
5,Purchased it exclusively for time machine backups on my MacBook. While the device is physically connected to the router my MacBook is wireless. Unattended backups are working flawlessly.
5,I bought this drive for my DVD collection and to work with Plex media player. It was difficult getting my plex app to recognize the WD drive but I did get it to work and I can watch movies from a remote location.
5,Great product. Stored all my pictures to view with family and the wife uses the app to save pictures on to her phone to print out.
5,Bought this on primeday to use as my plex server and it is working great so far! the fact that i got it for super cheap (50% off) was a plus. I have told my friends and family to order one as well as it is cheaper they paying for online storage and has all the same functions!
5,Does exactly what it says.  Easy to set up and use.  Only drawback is the very slow transfer speed via the router/ethernet cabling.  But it's not intended to be an external hard drive - it's a backup device.  And it works great for that.  I love the fact that I can get to my files from anywhere too!
4,Easy retrieval of data. Bought it just in time.
5,Don’t get all the hate for this device for us t fulfills it’s meant “for Home” purpose simple file transfers and backups from my MacBook Pro or IPad Pro. it works great using the app or installing my WD discovery software. Worth it if you need it for simple picture and video file transfers or backups.
1,This is UNACEPTABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am trying to use this thing since two months and I can't. This thing and it is not doing what I paid for:- Using the desktop app it keeps disconnecting so I can't finish to upload my documents- it keeps disconnecting so I can't download my documents to USE them- on the browser most of the time it doesn't even let me log in- when I log in and transfer documents from there it keeps stopping half of the process- using the ethernet cable same issues also it doesn't let you connect directly.Basically I don't know what to do with this thing. I paid to have ALL my documents uploaded on a cloud and I don't have it.If you don't want to be a mad person don't buy it.
5,Great price for the capacity. Super easy to add to home network and set up with Plex.
1,My old "My Cloud" software allowed me to keep my laptop and desktop sync'd even when traveling.The the "My Cloud Personal" has software touted as "syncing" but all it really does it backup to the hard drive. I can "sync" both pc's to their own directories on the HD but it is a one way backup only.  The directories can me "shared" and I can manually move files and manually sync them but the provided software will not sync two PC's using the HD as an intermediary (as the old software did). And the old software won't recognize the new HD.
1,Used it attached to my COMCAST router without problems to do Time Machine backups. Stopped because I didn't need it. Tried to restart yesterday and even though the device looks like it should work it doesn't. It's not showing up on the network. Chat only support is offered. I'm an hour and a half in and the guy on the other end keeps asking me to find information that's not available because the device is offline. Really disappointing. Won't buy another product from this company.
1,Spent two 12 hr days trying to make this thing work.  Really wanted it too.  Take a look at their website before you buy.  Their "Help videos" are from 2014.  They don't match the software they use now.  I cant contact anyone as the customer service line refers me back to the internet and does not allow me to talk to someone. I can't use Apple's Time Machine to back-up my computer which is the whole reason to buy one of these.  Here was the clincher when I emailed them they said this device was made to back up phones.  So I guess they cant make a device that backs up multiple products.  I'm hoping to figure out a way to return this piece of garbage!!!
1,I placed all my child’s photos on here to offload from my phone. Within a few weeks I had lost everything. Support said the drive was corrupted and couldn’t do anything since it was purchased through Amazon. I’ve lost all of my first child’s photos!! Never again would use this thing - I should have gone with cloud storage service right away! :(I could never recommend this thing.
1,Here are all the reasons I dislike this product:+ Bad implementation of macOS Time Machine Backups.It does backups but it's poorly integrated into macOS. You have to attach it as a guest user.+ Terrible transfer speeds over networkThis is probably due to some bottleneck in my home network but don't expect to have great performance from this device out of the box without upgrading your home network. This can cost more than you expect.+ Doesn't store photos well.Since it takes forever for transfers to happen on a slower network viewing/previewing photos takes forever!I will be taking my refund money and saving up to build a proper NAS storage array w/ more configurability and features as well as upgrading my network. Don't waste your time and effort w/ this trash.
3,Es muy limitado en cuanto a las opciones que puedo escoger. Administrar el espacio de almacenamiento usado por cuentas invitados descargar directorios completos previsualizar ciertos archivos o documentos velocidad de carga de mini imagenes DNLA y PLEX son un real problema.
1,This is a very simplified version of their other My Cloud product that only provides access via the WD portal or mobile app.  You can add files and access via the portal and mobile app but thats all you can do.The product lacks a critical feature on any storage option no backup solutions. Unlike their other product there is no option to backup to a USB attached drive or any location. Because the desktop app provide functionality to only the Windows Explorer you can not access the device with any other application. Therefor you are unable to use backup software to backup to another hard drive or location. WD Backup software wont' recognize it either.This is a critical problem as when the hard drive fails. you loose all your photos and videos unless you keep the original location. Only purchase this product if you don't value your data.
1,I am very disappointed in this product. It is completely useless to me.I have been very happy in the pas with the Western Digital My Cloud devices and when I was running low on space recently I purchased this additional unit which I am unable to use at all. Unlike the previous My Cloud drives I've purchased in the past this one cannot be mounted as an NFS volume and cannot be administered via SSH. Also unlike the previous ones it cannot even be mounted as a Windows share. I cannot access it t all from Linux which makes it completely useless to me. It may as well be a brick.I saw nothing in the product listing to indicate that this was any different than previous versions and only after trying to set it up do I learn from WD support that it's "not a NAS device".I won't be purchasing Western Digital products in the future.
5,Excellent product. I was able to utilize the capacity to back up most of the files on my computer.
5,Works great for all of our family photos!  Fantastic investment investment.
1,Low usability. Can’t connect anymore to home network. Overheating issues. Don't buy!!!
5,No damage from shipping the product looks as described and was easy to setup. Still using it after a few years.
2,Takes an IT specialist to hook it up. We called their tech support and after they couldn't figure it out they hung up on us. So we've been watching videos and reading tutorials and still don't know how it works. Right now it's an expensive paperweight.
3,It is extrematly slow. Good interface but it is very very very slow.
1,I have always purchased WD NAS/Cloud drives in the past. This product does not allow connecting to a LAN and if you upload files to the drive and try to use them you have to download to the device. I bought these to free up space on my Surface and solid state laptop. I am also concerned about security since you use there website to access the drive located in your house. I returned both drives I bought. I would rather increase my Cloud storage with One Drive for the cost of this drive.
2,If I were to purchase a cloud storage device again I'd spend the extra money and get a true NAS device that gives you more control.  With this device you don't have root access so you're forced to connect using their software and then your options are very limited.  It also disconnects frequently and I have to restart the device and the app to reconnect.  You can't even give a new user admin privileges even though admin privs give you very limited control to begin with.  Lastely the apps you can install on the device are very limited.
1,Was not working could not get anyone to help difficult to set up and you are more likely to loose all your data
1,This product is completely garbage and utterly useless and doesn't do what it claims to be able to.  It isn't easy or seemless to use across multiple devices or platforms.  Which is frustrating. When moving among IOS Android Windows osx Linux it is particularly weak on IOS and Android devices.  It doesn't show up as a file storage location in applications or even when downloading files from websites on IOS or Android operating systems which makes it's (access from anywhere concept totally false).  It is frustrating to move files to and from it on mobile devices including chrome os.  Not the solution I was hoping it would be.  I should have just done an owncloud on rhaspberry pi server.  At least they offer direct integration on IOS and Android
5,Easy set up. Old model not recognized by Win 10.
4,Just what I expected
1,This product is absolutely nothing like it appeared to advertise. I thought I was buying a back up drive that would automatically save files that could be used as a back up to my cell phone or computer. Apparently all it is useful for is saving photos and there is absolutely no organization involved. It simply lists each photo one after another with a date. No intuitive way to allow it to organize or re-organize anything. I could not be more disappointed after paying so much for something I know will hardly ever use. Don’t waste your time or your money.
1,I'm trying to find a way to return this or throw it on the street.  Bought it to connect as a backup to a WD Cloud - it can't connect because this is a "Home Cloud."  Apparently completely different and incompatible.  Then thought at least I could use it as a music server - the music is all stops and starts because there's so much happening in the background.  Then I couldn't figure out why our home wifi wasn't working spent all day restarting things until I yanked the cord on the WD - all of a sudden the wifi works fine.  This thing was using 100% of network resources just sitting there.  Disappointing and confusing on so many levels everything I didn't want or expect from a white box.  Oh and it's loud rattles the whole shelf.
1,I just bought and installed this "mac os friendly NAS" as recommend by several "profesional review" sites.... but what a piece of junk this is!  It doesnt work in MAC OS don't buy into the hype they sell on their website!I consider myself an expert IT user (having an Systems Engineering Degree and over 25 years of IT experience). but I threw the towel with this.  If there were 0 stars this is what this would get!I was expecting to upgrade my old 1TB Airport Time Capsule with this but not to avail.  I am keeping my old NAS for now.
3,You can drag and drop folder and files in one step but you can only download one file at a time. So don't expect to use it to back up anything in bulk with the intention or restoring it easily later.
1,Based on the user agreement nothing you add is private. The end user license restricts what you can store on the system. It cannot be IP'ed and directly connected to.  HP controls it from the cloud and they get any data you have so everything placed on the system could be reviewed by HP.  Tax returns pictures financial records they would see it all.  There appears to be be no way to lock it down to being a NAS.
3,I don't recommend it. It is complicate upload files there and it need Internet to it.
4,I have not found a way to share the folder only instead of the complete access to the entire cloud to select people.
3,I returned this product as it requires Western Digital's cloud to operate. Not what I wanted. Just wanted an NAS.
5,Plenty of storage capacity reasonable investment and a company that has provided personal and reliable service to me for over two decades.  I have not had to use tech support for this device but the five stars are for service previously experienced with their other devices.
4,Video pictures and movies
5,Great for storage and backup accessable from my phone. Exactly what i needed
1,If you delete a large quantity of files space is not freed up. They say it takes 24  to 49 hours but I’m still waiting after one week. Google this topic before you buy.
1,My Cloud devices do work after initial purchase. Then WD arbitrarily disables any network functionality rendering the device an overpriced hard drive. To add insult to injury WD will offer you a 20% discount if you buy a replacement device that is more than 300% the cost of the original. After having it for just 3 months.
3,en general esta bien pero me molesta que para poder ver cualquier archivo de Office tengas que descargarlo deberían de solucionar eso.otra cosa que les falta es que puedas subir carpetas completas y no archivo por archivo.
1,I have a 6 year old MyCloud that I love but needs replaced.  Expecting this one to work like the old one I placed some files in the public folder but the app doesn't see them.  So I uploaded some files from the app and they did not show up.  Come to find out you need to run a special app to see the files uploaded with the app on the computer and if you want to get to the files in the public folder with the app you are just out of luck.  Not sure why WD decided to make a good simple usable device so convoluted but I'm sending it back.
4,Easy to transfer files to store but did not keep files organized
5,Great storage device
2,The tech-support I referred to here is WD they were dreadful. Disrespectful pedantic and not helpful.The intermediary from Amazon support was excellent respectful good communications.
5,Good!  Works like a charm.
1,My old (by old I mean 16 months old) 8tb Mycloud NAS drive crashed. I thought this was the same but it's not. On the old drive I could view my files on Roku Media Player but with this crap I need Plex. And the interface ain't user friendly. Not sure why WD changed to this POS but they need to go back to their old technology which was way better.
5,As I was wanting a real NAS I replaced my old My Cloud with the MY CLOUD HOME.  Totally different and much better operation. Easily accessed from my iPhone and/or iMac.
1,I bought this like others you can see to be used as a NAS drive but it doesn't function anything like a Network Attached Storage and so is useless for many functions among them holding large amounts of music and mounting a network "share" to a Blusound player.  I found out too late that this drive was a complete scam as it isn't a real NAS drive and won't work as one.  The software is clunky and terrible and limiting.  Piece of crap; Western Digital should be ashamed of themselves.  As a result of this purchase I'm done with WD for life.
1,Next to impossible to get set up in one day. Everywhere you turn it wants you to pay subscriptions to software to access your drive data. Largely useless as a video server. Will not interface with Roku or Chrome Cast. The older versions of this unit allowed you to start a video and it would follow on with the next one in your library. Not this one you have to tell it what to play every single time.Absolutely will not stream quality video.What makes this more annoying I purchased this unit as Christmas gift. It looks like I'll have to return it and figure out something else.Huge mistake on WD's part. Ironically this obsession to get a monthly fee from accessing my own data is what has killed their competitors.
5,MUY BUEN SERVIDOR BUEN PRECIO BUENA CALIDAD GRAN EQUIPO...
5,Love it
1,This is the worst product I have purchased from amazon I can't believe WD actually made this POS!!!  You are firewalled behind their software!!!! No way to access the device over the network????  Are you crazy!!! I don't care if it not an NAS or not you should be able to access local without the internet!  I am complaining about this til I turn blue...
1,This happened.  The product that as received was clearly not new: packaged resealed missing ethernet cable quick start card torn and taped back together.  I should have returned it at that point. I tried to use it anyway: Mac Air M1 Big Sur for Time Machine backup Nest Mesh WiFi.  Setup went ok.  In use however the computer kept freezing requiring hard reboot.  Some of my data got written to the drive but I could not find a way of erasing it so could not return it.
5,It works as intended.
5,Es perfecto para lo que necesitaba.
3,Still trying to work out the Buggs on third party software to allow dlna. Where as my old model dlna was already a part of the unit
2,Deletes take like 5 times longer than copying a file to or from it.
5,👍
1,I've worked in IT for ...too long. Western digital used to make a fairly solid NAS cloud system. It wasn't the fastest but for the price ease of use and remote access you couldn't beat it.  Their new version though (ugh) I don't know how it made it out of testing. The CTO should be fired over this. Transfers from this cloud to a local machine on the same network were in the Bytes/second range of speed. Not megabytes/second not even kilobyte/second. Bytes! My internet connection is 500MB/second. I tried for about a month and a half every day to get this system speed up. Then gave up. It's just not worth it and because it's over 30 days I can't return it. YAY!
5,was easy to set up and use. would recommend.
5,Like that
1,Very disappointed with this drive. Terrible user interface multiple requests to download different files confusing to setup and maintain multiple requests for logins.If you want to perform a simple task of “storage” then I would pass on this
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!Do not buy any WD My Cloud product. In fact do not buy ANY WD product! I had the 6TB drive connected for 2 days moved about 200GB of family photos to the drive & a day later the drive locked up. WD support is NO HELP.  Many other complaining of same issue in WD Forums & no response from the company.
5,This product is incredibly easy to set-up and use. Safely store your accessible files in your own personal cloud.
1,It was not until I tried to add the device to my network that I discovered you can't have more than one MyCloud drive on a home network.  Consequently I paid $190 for a three pound paperweight.  I returned this device and ordered a generic outboard hard drive.  WD website said they "may" at some time in the future do a firmware update that will allow more than one device on the network.  That's not encouraging nor helpful.
5,It connects easily and provides a good information capacity. Highly recommended
1,My first unit began clicking sound so I returned and replaced it.  After 5 months the second one went bad also.  Western Digital charges shipping to return a defective product.  If you want an advanced placement they charge $25.00!  So you have no way to backup your data while it is being taken care of.Very poor service.
1,This item has been opened. It didn’t come with a user manual. It has fingerprints all over it. I don’t know if I should plug it in or not.
1,This thing is no different that if you were to sign up for an off site cloud storage. You can't connect to it if you're off line. No internet no access. From what I read the version before this one you could connect to it through your home network off line. The only reason that I bought this thing is because I don't trust off site  internet storage. You want to keep you stuff safe you keep it within you own walls.
5,Love it
1,I really liked this for about 7 months.  Then Western Digital announced that it was ending support for this product.  So it is basically an overpriced USB drive now.  Spend a little more get a Sinology DS220+.  It's not quite as user friendly but at least it will work in January 2022.
5,Is a very good
5,We bought this to integrate with Time Machine on multiple Macs. It was easy to set up and now all our laptops back up automatically without worry. Definitely adds peace of mind!
5,great BUY WORKS GRET
1,The only way you can get access to YOUR files on YOUR nas is to install their proprietary software. That software is the only way you can map your nas.The only folder you can access without this software or via the mobile app is the 'public' folder.Their tech support was worthless they would not help me map it via ip address.Others have also said its impossible to map via ip or host name. They have locked down smb to only the public folder somehow.This is why this one is so cheap but dont be fooled Its not ok. You should not need special software to access your data on a NAS.
4,Arrived on time worked for an hour then died.. Amazon replaced immediately. Replacement works as described..
5,Very easy to setup and log into! Small easy to hide behind an entertainment center!
2,A lot of other people have reviewed this product saying that it is "not a network drive". Blindly I didn't listen and was very disappointed in what I got.This product is a home cloud device with a mediocre application (website and mobile) that can store files. There's nothing impressive about this product.If you're purchasing this for someone who is not very tech-savvy they might enjoy this cloud a lot.
5,Set it and forget it. It backs my photos up every night
5,I don't know why i never had something like this before but for home or small office its great! i store family photos or work documents i need to access on the app. I can view almost everything from my phone!!! Great Product!
5,Works exactly as advertised.  I have no previous experience with any NAS devices but I have had no problems with the my cloud home. It has a very easy interface and very convenient for what I use it for (storage of files and pictures) and easily accessible on my phone.
1,When we purchased this back up drive we thought we could back up our computers continuously. After buying we found out you had  to pay for this feature or just get one back up  per computer per week. My wife is a writer and needs continuous backups. Very slick of them. Advertise cloud base  back up and when you buy the back drive itself you find out that you have to pay for this feature. Very dissapointed. Will be sending this back and use Aoples icloud.The apple Icloud back up is easier to use and cheaper.
4,Returned it because it didn’t do what I needed
1,I'm so sad. At first I was so happy I made this purchase. Two years later my My Cloud Home wouldn't go online and made flickering noises at start up. I was worried but thought that the data could be easily recovered as it was more of a hardware issue. Sent it to one of their recommended data recovery vendors. They emailed me to inform me that my data was IRRETRIEVABLE. My heart just sunk. 20+ years of pictures gone in a flash without notice. I have most of the pictures scattered on other hard drives but most of my newest pictures were on this. I'm never buying one of these again. My anxious heart can't take losing anymore precious moments.
5,Item just arrived and so far I am very happy with itOnly took about 10 minutes to connect and start transferring filesWhole experience is very user friendly and seems to perform well  for the task it was intended
1,This is NOT a NAS drive. It can only be used with the very limited application that is provided with it. I have several other WD NAS drives but this on is NOT a NAS regardless of how it is advertised. Its a shame too as the HW is good and the performance is good as well. This not like the WD My Book Live or My Cloud products which are great. I would have never purchased this if I had known it was not actually a NAS as advertised.
5,Great product
5,This is my second one no issues whatsover
5,Excelente
5,a
5,I use it in my office and i'ts great and reliable.
5,Great
2,I was looking for a Network Attached Storage (NAS) This device is not a NAS however as the software continues to improve it is becoming an essential part of my home network. It acts like any other cloud device or service and is available anywhere you can access the Internet. A new feature just added gives you access to a Folder called "Family" that can be used to share files between people with accounts on the device much like a NAS.
1,After using the WD MyCloud service for a month I suddenly wasn't able to access it. Contacted Support via email and was directed to the online links to troubleshoot (even though I stated I already executed the basic troubleshooting steps). Called Support and was asked the same questions I had answered in my initial email. Connected to Level 2 Support who spent the time asking me the same questions researching with his colleagues and directing me back to the online support links. After a few hours the issue was not resolved and I need to troubleshoot the service using the support links. Have reverted back to iCloud and my old external hard drives as my backup and will be reselling or giving this away.
5,Happy with my purchase..  used to pay dropbox yearly service and feel I'm just as secured and saving money with my own hard drive.
5,This is a very user friendly device. I like it because it is very easy to set up and use which is exactly what I wanted. I returned a previous WD storage device that was too complicated for me to set up and use which I hated.
1,Muchos problemas de funcionamiento con Windows no se puede desinstalar la app desde windows. Muy fácil de instalar en un comienzo pero después de un tiempo ya no tengo acceso a los archivos vía carpeta compartida (sólo funciona carpeta Public) sólo se pueden accesar los archivos vía app o web. Muy mal producto mucho mejor un simple NAS con DLNA NFS SAMBA etc.
5,Works grest
5,good value
5,I recommend it
5,Fantastic back up option should of got it a long talk me ago
5,I was constantly maxing out my one drive and I just wanted a cloud storage to myself. This worked quickly and perfectly. I will say you won't be able to open certain file types through their app for your phone such as powerpoints.
4,Easily set up and ready to use
2,Useful but very slow and difficult to upload info.  Easier to connect an external drive directly to the cloud drive
1,Set up per instructions and tried to setup an account to activate this device. It would not connect to the internet and that is the only way it can be  activated and used. I am returning it for a similar device from a different manufacturer.
5,Moble app works on one of my phones but not the other. Every  thing is the same in the settings. Bot phone are made by the same manufacturer.
5,Youre perfect Nas and great support from WD. For work and office.
1,I bought this device to house my videos and use plex. Plex stopped working 6 months ago because it will not update and today I received an email saying they are not supporting it anymore and I will only have local access in 2022. So my advice it s STAY  AWAY!
1,The MyCloud Home app is the only way to access this drive.  It does not allow for any drive management outside basic add and delete files.  The drive deletes files in a batch job and if you delete to many files it will fill up the drive making it unusable until the job actually frees up space.  This is the worst design of a NAS drive I have ever seen.  I am considering taking it apart and using the drive in another standalone NAS just to try to get my money out of it.  This is a total piece of junk.  DO NOT BUY.
5,Super easy installation and the app is great!  No issues thus far!
2,No DNLA capabilities. Sucks (Use plex instead) destroyed two external hard drives. Worked for two years though.
1,VERY disappointed.  Without a live internet connection you are unable to read/write the drive.  Requires special software to "see" the drive and it does not allow you to simply assign an ip address like a normal device.If you have one of the newer Macs with M1 it is unsupported and cannot even read the drive due to the requirement of special software WD said they have no plans to support.  Worse Tech investment ever made.
1,This product is terrible and the support is equally bad.  I bought this expecting to plug it into my wifi and backup.  After setting up an account jumping through many hoops on line and then getting it connected to my wifi I found out that it doesn't work with Time Machine.  Using the WD backup software showed that it would take 3 days to back up a few Gb.  I called support and after waiting 10+ minutes on hold I spoke to someone who absolutely did not want to help me --lots of dumb questions and very little help.  Don't buy this.
1,Could not get past step 2 of the "quick" start guide.  Spent over two hours on WD support chat and phone calls to be told "you'll have to return the unit because it's very possible it's defective".  You think!  Definitely not worth spending hundreds on something that is time consuming and not in working order.
1,Wester Digital forums have been littered with issues in how the OS's for Mac's do not work as expected with Cloud Drive.  Once installed there are issues with FINDER SAFARI and other apps locking up which then require a hard reset/reboot of your computer.  Also when trying to access files from the external drive the files are not accessible more often than not and once again will require reboot in order to access files upon login.
5,Safeguarding my data and controlling it myself was important to me I continue to find data on different computers I have which I have not backed up on My Cloud which gives me redundancy and piece of mind.
1,It just doesn't work Mac pro M1.I am feeling really stuck between a rock and a hard place.Sync: Sync doesn't work from Mac pro-M1Download: Works from myCloud UI and you know what 1 file at a time. it would take me million years to download all the individual files.Support: they said we don't support it and wait until July 2021 to make it work. Right click folder sync doesnt work
3,Very easy to set upBut lacks controls and overseeing options. Even as administrator you can't see what other put on the cloud unless they share it
4,Good
1,The only thing worse than a device that is not designed to keep up with OS updates is the CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I'm patient and I can understand isolated situations but I every experience has been painful both chat and phone service.  ZERO results on the help rendering the unit 100% useless.
1,!!! FALSE ADVERTISING BY WESTERN DIGITAL !!! When purchasing a Duo unit it is half the capacity advertised because they are using RAID 1. I am a highly technical user and when I read 8TB capacity in RAID 1 I expect 2 8TB drives to be installed and mirrored. This is listed no where in the product descriptions on any sales page; from Amazon or else wise. You have to look at a picture of the box and read the fine print under the size you are purchasing to see that you are not getting what you expectShame on WD!!!Besides the false advertising on the storage size this product is very easy to setup and use. Took about 5 minutes.
1,Do yourself a favor and do not get this product. I lost everything. It was working great and one day out of the blue it stopped working took 2.5 hours with customer support to pretty much tell me “oh well that sucks” and my photos that mean a lot to me will forever be gone even after spending $1500 to a repair shop to try to save the data.
1,AFTER 2 MONTHS I CAN NO LONGER ACCESS THE DEVICE.CUSTOMER SUPPORTS SUGGESTED THAT I CONNECT IT DIRECTLY TO MY COMPUTER. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO DO THAT IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED ONLINE ONLY.SHOWS HOW GREAT THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS.I AM GOING TO TRY TO GET IT REPLACED IT IS A 6 TERIBYTE UNIT SO IT WAS NOT CHEAP.
1,I have several Western Digital external hard drives and thought it would be great to be able to connect them to this device via a USB hub (as the description/directions say you can) and be able to access those drives from my laptop tablet or phone from throughout my house or from anywhere. Surprise! External hard drives connected to the USB are only accessible through the mobile applications; you cannot access them through the desktop app - which eliminates the laptop. For me that defeats the entire reason for purchasing the thing and it's going back tomorrow. So it's cloud storage - sort of which strikes me as sort of worthless
5,Works just expected  I quit purchasing my apple cloud for my old pics and save all to this personal cloud.  Love it and even my relatives can access pictures when I share the link to them (overseas).
5,Great product.  Much better than previous generations. Only bad things didn’t work with Mac iOS high Sierra directly but you can make it work with online.
1,I made a horrible mistake trusted WD!  I have 5 other WD network drives and was going to consolidate 3 of the 2GB drives on my new drive.  I had no idea WD changed their drive system to a non-standard DLNA. You HAVE TO USE PLEX to access it as a media drive. Does not work on Kodi FireTV or any my DLNA devices.  I wasted over a week and it still does not work right.  Older drives have worked great for years.  The new drive is total sh*it.  DO NOT BUY!!!!
5,Works great for what I need
1,I am having trouble signing into my drive and thus cannot use it. I went to the WD support page and there at the top is my question! When I click on the question it takes me to a page that says "this page no longer exists." I tried accessing the support page and got a message saying it was down. So I may be SOL. I guess I'll have to return.
5,Excelente producto
4,Easy to set up lots of storage for the money.
1,Everything exposed through web interface no 2-factor authentication.  If this is what you need and you are comfortable with this level of security….I’m not.  What I needed was a central share drive on my local network.  Should have read the documentation more carefully.
1,Do not I repeat DO NOT even attempt to use this for time machine backups. Best it does is store pics from your phone but I’ve been unable to retrieve my time machine backup after a previous computer was water damaged. Thank goodness I used this product for only a month so I lost a month of work. Could have been much worse.
1,To configure the NAS drive sitting on the shelf beside me I have to log into the Western Digital website and let THEM configure my drive from their end.  I can no longer log into the admin panel on my own NAS drive.  That means if their site is down or I don't have access I cannot configure my own drive in my own house.  That makes it their drive not mine.  This is completely unacceptable and I shall never buy another drive from WD until they allow me to once again own my drive.
5,For a unit @home... it fits perfectly into my array of system components... I love it.  It auto updates the software and firmware and I have no hiccups while away... retrieving files remotely... I love it!
5,It seems secure enough and it was pretty easy to use. I love that I can plug in an external hard drive and it will permit me to download files without an internet transfer.
1,The good:  Set up was super easy.  Anyone should be able to have this thing running in five minutes or less.The bad:  This device is not an upgraded version of the My Cloud.  DLNA support has been completely removed.  DLNA is the whole reason I wanted to purchase a new NAS.Yes you can load and use Plex but it's a really rough interface and most of my files aren't even recognized.  WD made a terrible mistake by removing DLNA.  They have effectively cut themselves off from a large part of the market.
5,Fácil instalación y muy buen soporte récnico. Funciona muy bien
1,This is the result of sales executives who decide to design products based on previous best sellers. I think they said in some conference room “Let’s take a perfectly good product strip any feature that you need to be technical to setup add home to the name and drop the price.  We can sell this to people who don’t know better.  I feel sad for anyone who’s first experience with a NAS is this Hot Mess of unfunctional.  The functions are so stripped down to the point that it is little more than an unsecured external drive with a network port.
5,You have to set-up for 8 or 16 TB. So make sure you do that before you start uploading or you have to erase all data stored!
1,Software isn't ready for prime time. It's not a bad device if all you want to do is backup files from other devices and share them in the cloud but if you want to use this as your primary storage space this isn't the product to do it. The main problem is that the software has no backup function. You cannot connect another device to the My Cloud Home and have the My Cloud do scheduled backups to it. This is a major issue and makes the product dangerous to use if you care about backing up your files. Given my recent experiences with WD you may want to look at another brand.
2,This is not a NAS! It does not present mountable storage on your local network in any usable way. Western Digital forums are full of people astounded and disappointed at the limitations of the My Cloud Home devices.Looking for a NAS? Look at the standard My Cloud or other brands; stay away from this Home model.
2,I have several WD network storage devices.  This one claims to do that inaddition to being a personal cloud device.  It does not work well as only a network device.  None of my existing WD software products recognizes this device.  I can only get to it through a cloud login.
1,If you're familiar with any IT concepts the inability to secure this device when using it is a huge problem. If you use it for Time Machine backups ENCRYPT the backups. The share is open to any user (you must use "Guest" to connect to it) and isn't configurable.I bought this to do Time Machine backups from two computers. One worked the other didn't. Support was terrible.I'm going to buy a Synology instead.
1,If you are looking for a easy to use network backup drive to use inconjunction with older WD network drives this isn't for you. WDs whole setup process is convoluted with two different Discovery apps that only see a particular type of cloud device. The backup app that comes with the My Home Cloud drive isn't even recognized by its own drive let alone other network drives. I also think that the home user is unimportant to WD since they don't seem responsive to home user problems. It was a poor purchase on my part.
1,This device does not natively have drivers for windows! You have to download the discovery tool in order to get it on the LAN. Through this process they want to glean your information through you sharing information. I needed it for a backup HDD and it won’t fill that role for a client.
2,Mind bogglingly slow! Takes 25 minutes to upload a 30mb file? Good to access my files remotely but it takes forever. My internet speeds are 75upload and 75 download. Should not be this slow to retrieve small files. Even to access the network folder takes forever. Not recommended
2,My intent was to use this product on my local lan as well as from the internet. You can not do that without installing apps/plugins. Waisted my money. Access via SAMBA has a limited number of concurrent connections )5?) It is now a paper weight.
2,Me siento engañado. No se deja configurar osea es un disco duro en la nube y no deja entrar me comunico con el fabricante y el me dice que de 2 años de garantía que dan. Le quedan 2 meses de garantia con el fabricanta
5,With a laptop I wanted a backup solution that didn't require being tethered to an external drive. This network drive was the perfect solution.
1,I have a lot of experience with NASes.  I own a Seagate NAS QNAP NAS and a Synology NAS.  This is no NAS.  I only brought it because it was inexpensive and I need it to backup some directories.  The software is truly awful to use.  It is not clear to me when you copy files from a computer to the MyCloud NAS on the same local network whether it goes out to the internet or not.  It has been less than 1 hour since it arrived and I am packing it up to be returned.
3,A pain to setup. They tried to make it simple but it’s so difficult to customize
1,I have been to 4 different links provided by the manufacturer for manuals. The first was the link provided in the very sparse documentation that comes with the hard drive.  Not one manual was for this specific model.  Just trying to set a static IP address so I can control access across my network.  Nope. Wasted $150.  I'll see if there's anything I can do with it at the house.  Certainly won't be worth the $ though.  WD should be clear on what their various models do.  Can't afford to flush money down the toilet very often.
5,This was very easy to set up and it’s doing exactly what I need it to do. Love that you can automatically back up things like Dropbox too.  I’m quite pleased with it.
1,Evidently there is no way to turn off the stupid volume. Everytime the drive does something it beeps. It's always beeping. So unless you have a seperate room in your house to put it into that humans don't enter be prepared to be annoyed. Oh WD support has gone to complete crap. Don't expect any decent customer service from them.
1,I got mine in April 2018 and a week ago I got an email saying they updated it. When I got home I could no longer connect to it in any way. So I tried to get ahold of WD to no avail when they didn’t respond to my attempts to contact I took matters into my own hands tore it apart and put the hard drive in my Hard Drive Enclosure Docking Station. After numerous tests and tries to get my data off or even to format the drive. Every program or operating system or anything I could think of showed signs of firmware corruption.
1,So very disappointed with this cloud storage. Extremely difficult to install confusing not user friendly at all. And I am not a computer novice. Once installed immediate problems with my network and could not launch certain types of files like QuickBooks. I spent days trying to correct those problems but never could. And the final coup it only acts as a single storage device it does not store and sync files locally so if you have a slow connection or worse no connection forget about access to your files. Uninstalled it and returned it. If you are just looking for extra external storage there are way cheaper options.
1,This product worked intermittently and then stopped working within 3 months. It cost me more to troubleshoot with our tech guy than the unit itself. Customer support is poor and the device isn't worth it. Very disappointed...
1,I have an older version of wd cloud device which was great.This device you can't set static IP you can't create local users without giving the app permissions to contacts.I was disappointed and returned device
5,Love the storage... only thing I don’t like is my home pc has to be ON and not asleep for my phone info to sync.
5,I love this drive.  I have over 23 devices connected to my network and this is one of the best things we own.
1,Once I got the item hooked up and configured my PCs laptops picked it up on the network. However my PS4 and smart Tv wouldn't. Called customer service they advised I have to download and link PLEX TV app with it in order to share files with smart TVs which I did. Still didn't work. Customer service suggested remake a whole new account with different email in order to make it work but he wasn't sure. Returned it immediately shouldn't be this difficult something this simple to set up when I pay $150.
2,Worked fine for couple months and now it keeps restarting every 3/4 minutes.It's a huge inconvenience and it's making us delay work without being able to meet our deadlines.Submitted a ticket hopefully they will be able to fix the issue ASAP.
5,Pretty seamless zero issues to report wish adding users was more friendly
1,Setup fine on windows but doesn't integrate with the newest iteration of Mac OS.  The WD Discovery software won't uninstall from Mojave correctly and folders can't be accessed locally to get to files for use in Photoshop or other apps.  Spent over two hours on the phone with WD support trying to work through the issues and was nowhere nearer a solution at the end than when I started.  If it weren't for the fact that I also need some space for windows machines this would already be in a box and on its way back.
1,If you have a mac and you want to use this don't bother just get a regular drive this is annoying AF to use and it makes no sense why it exists like it does I regret buying it.
5,Quick and easy replacement for old myBook personal cloud device.
1,Not realistically compatible with MAC.  Had lots of problems with set up until browsing down through a bunch of WD's links finally found out why.  Turns out that when connecting to a Mac it can only be set up as a Guest user.  Since there's barely any security for Guest users WD suggests encrypting the backup.  At that point the drive becomes so slow that it's practically useless.
1,I always kept one of these on hand for use for clients that needed a device to scan to from a MFC printer using SMB.  The old version was great and worked very well. This new version is all cloud based and gives you no ability to directly share your folders on a network via SMB protocol. Very disappointed with this new version.  I tend to keep one on hand and found this out today when I went to use it.  Unfortunately I am now beyond the return period and am stuck with this piece of junk.
3,Everything went well until I found out the app WD Discover is not Mojave compatible
1,The former MyCloud drive was a very useful network storage with decent features and management capabilities!Stripping one feature or another is understandable when upgrading a device but completely restricting the device to the point of making it impossible access the folders unless you install a very limited application is below the standards we expect from such well stablished data management company like WD!I returned for full refund after checking with Tech Support that the device wasn't designed to go beyond the limited scope of saving photos/music directly from mobile devices...
2,I was not satisfied with this My Cloud Home product and I returned it. It it is very noisy when it boots up. It doesn't have a dashboard UI and many of the apps didn't recognize it. It's basically a large external drive but if that is all you need then you are good to go.
3,DLNA is completely useless in this model.  It's a downgrade not an upgrade from previous MyCloud devices.
2,I should have read more reviews.. I is slow can't tell anything about how much  space is left. Just don't like it at all and I am an I.T. guy..  I will use it as a standalone back up drive..
2,This is NOT a standard NAS drive.  It requires the WD Discovery app to be running or you cannot access the drive or any files on it.  Sometimes the app works properly and sometimes not leaving files inaccessible.  Will be searching for a real NAS to replace this!
1,Could not contact customer support.  Had to return bc I couldn’t connect to device.  Now looking for another storage device with better customer service.
1,THEY ARE UPGRADING THEIR SYSTEM IN A FEW MONTHS AND NONE OF THESE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THE NEW FIRMWARE MEANING THEY WILL ONLY BE A DESKTOP HD IN A FEW MONTHS
3,Good but slow back up and hard to use withou internet connection
5,Plenty of space for all your pictures and movies. Easy to setup and even easier to use. 500 HD movies and not even halfway full.
5,Great product but I don't like that you cant break out the folders within Plex to ccreate Genres that can be seen within Plex.
5,If you want to save your pictures and video this is your device.
1,so if it goes offline you can't access your stuff. I wish I'd delved further into this before I bought it but it makes little to no sense to me to have a local storage option rely on internet access.I can't think of any application this would be suitable for.
5,It works exactly likely supposed to great
5,I use it for cloud storage for smartphone.Just a simple setting and works automatically.The app makes message for backup status sometimes.Very easy and simple.
5,I really like that it does work like an internal home cloud to store my information.
2,Good price for nas storage but it doesn't do much. It seems intended as a backup device rather than a nas. You need to use the app for most features to work.
1,La transferencia de archivos es demasiado lenta. No lo recomiendo para archivos grandes. A parte no compatible con varios tipos de archivos en Mac.Hace 2 dias el equipo dejo de funcionar me toco restablecer el sistema se arreglo pero desafortunadamente perdí toda la información almacenadaNo lo recomiendo
4,performs as expected
1,Purchased this in February 2018  to solve the problem of photos bogging down the laptop. Seemed to work great. Was simple and efficient. We moved in July of 2018 and when we set it up at our new place it no longer worked. I cannot access family photos. EXTENSIVE NUMBERS OF PHOTOS are functionally gone as of now. DEVASTATED!!! Am looking into a data recovery service to salvage this situation. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AND WOULD NEVER WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE WHO VALUES THEIR PHOTOS.
1,There is no way to configure this unit unless you create a WD account. I wanted a NAS unit for my home for private information but in order to use this you need to create an account with them so your data can be available on the internet. You can not configure this except through WD website. I understand some people like that but I do not. I am a software developer and don't want my source code to be available online. Will be returning this unit.
1,I wanted to use this devce as a traditional NAS using SMB to map windows drive letters to directories.It's designed so that I cannot.Bad Idea!
5,Nice product the cloud is so fast.
5,Absolutely the best investment in a long time.  One place storage and privacy too. Accessible anywhere there is an internet connection.  Now how do I backup this device?
1,Perfect as a personal pc cloud device especially if you need to access also from your phone.The issue is if you want to share folders with your family which the can modify. I decided it wouldn't work for me and ordered a more generic NAS solution.
5,it has big capacity but unfortunate you cant connect usb to mac or pc
1,WD goes out of their way to hide all of the advanced setting on this NAS device.  You basically have to load an unsupported after-market firmware on it to make it usable.  You can't even mount it as a network drive without loading the stupid WD Link software.  Not to mention it's tunneling many of the network transactions through a relay server that WD controls.  SO...  Unless you are going to hack the stupid out of this appliance don't buy it.
1,It is a useless piece of junk using any could service. I just cant believe WD is selling this product.30 minutes to copy over a 300mb folder from one computer to the other using this hd which is in my network wired connected.I should be working now but I'm writing this review because I'm waiting for the hard drive to decide to finish transmitting my data.
1,I already have a WD My cloud 2 TB which is GREAT!! So I figured I would get a 4TB to go with it this was the worst it would freeze and not respond when uploading files to it it would time out al in all I sent it back after havig it connected for 2 hrs. would not recommend
5,Works perfectly!
1,This sounds good but it’s a waste of money. The company stopped supporting it and now it’s just an overpriced thumb drive. I bought it while it was being supported and now I can’t even use it in my home network it has to be plugged directly into a single PC.
1,You seriously can't backup your DESKTOP? Third party software won't see the drive if it's connected via ethernet and their software won't allow you to sync your desktop folder. Seriously? What a joke. I keep important files on my desktop while I work on them so this is useless. POS design.
1,I already owned several of the WD MyCloud NAS drives. I needed more space so I decided to upgrade.  I assumed this was an upgrade as that is how WD seems to pitch it on their website.  However I could not get connected to it at all.  After some googling I discovered this device does not have a browser interface to configure it locally.  It has to connect to the cloud.  I sent them back immediately.
1,This is not the replacement for WD mycloud going end of life. There is no user interface or media server with this device. The proper replacement is the WD MyCloud EX2
1,I just finished setting up the 8TB version with all of my files. I got to the point where I'm connecting Sonos and discovered it doesn't support iTunes playlists. I should have read all of these comments before purchasing this. About to box it up and send it back.
3,Unable to turn off remote access like old model.  Returned.
1,Now you see the drive now you don't. Nightmare to work with on a mac no idea if its running some folder and syncable and some are not the drive disappears! Awful certainly not a plug and play device. Mac owns avoid.
1,I just returned my unit 2 hours after unpack it. It's really terrible. You can't use it as NAS. You need an Internet connection to make it work. There's no local folders sync. Everything should go to the Internet and then synced with this device. This is not a kind of solution that will fit my needs. I don't know why WD that used to create great devices did on this one. I'm going to a Synology NAS right now. Thanks WD!
1,I was unable to use the product because it requires you to get a WD account which then requires you to give WS your personal info. This was not clear in the product information. I'll be returning the product without ever using its storage features.
3,Can't play videos from it have to download to device to watch.
1,Works fine with my mac but doesn't respond the traditional way in Windows 10 explorer. Make sure to install the WD Discovery app so you can use as a network drive. Had to spend way too much time configuring this on Windows. Lots of online chatter about the same issues I had in set up.  Last WD device I'll ever buy. This was a replacement for  a 2TB MyBookLive which blew out after a few years. Your mileage may vary...
5,I'm testing this device. The SO is the Best got Home Users without experience in NAS.
5,This is what I wanted for too long. My data on my grip. All my important documents and pictures are kept in private.
1,Both backup programs recommended by Western Digital for this device do not work. It also has issues with Samba. Technical support was unable to resolve any of the issues I had.
5,Super cool works great only  thing is that speed wil be as your internet speed
1,The install instructions that came with the drive are beyond a joke. It consists of funny pictures that do not have anything to do with the installation procedure.  And if you want to put an Access database on the drive you are in real trouble.
1,Device itself worked as far as I could tell. But the WD software was hardly usable and gave my computer major issues. I had to delete it and try again... Still didn’t work. Eventually returned it and got a different brand.
1,I have had this thing for about 6 months and no matter what I do it doesn't work well.  Very very slow.  I've gotten a new modem router etc.  No improvement.  I can not use it as it was intended and I'm just using it as a backup.  It takes minutes to copy a file and minutes to bring up a file and close it.  Something very wrong with the system.
1,I've been pleased with my previous Western Digital Network Attached Storage units but have been unable to get this one to set it's name or to share through anything other than the wd utility.  My goal is to setup a share under a specific name using regular windows shares and user management.  The user management requires users to register e-mail accounts and sharing does not operate through regular windows shares making it unusable for my setup.
1,Need the interface allow access locally to your files instead of using the cloud when you are really at home.  Their missing some important feature in the software part.
1,I have 3 WD NAS devices and thought this was an upgrade to their previous My cloud devices. This is not. I cannot see it on my network and can not use it from my other devices. It should not be considered unless you want something for your phone that cannot be used as part of your private network. VERY BAD implementation by WD and their brochure verges on false advertising in my opinion suggesting it is a new and improved version.
1,5-day to Update Firmware! No warning no permission granted lost access to everything. I will never buy another WD product again. This is not how you treat people.
1,This is not Network Attached Storage.  It is some kind of Cloud hybrid that can be used to share files over the internet.  It is not suitable for Plex unless you use the built in Plex application meaning you can't attach this and other storage and share your media through a single Plex server.  WD My Cloud has served me well for many years but My Cloud Home is a POS.
1,First one was Dead on arrival.Tech support (after an hour or two and multiple transfers) had me pay a $10 shipping fee for sending me a replacement (used one).The device is very convenient to have for sharing files across the network but it is very slow. It took over night to copy my files to the back up device.
3,seems to work fine but expect multiple overheating alerts per day.
5,So far so good. Got so I could store pictures straight from my phone.
1,This product is defective.  My iT guy tried to speak with tech support and we got nowhere.  I tried calling but coujd not understand the gentleman.  They offered me no assistance.
5,So far so good
1,It is not a straightforward local network drive.Why should it be called NASI use MacOS Big Sur and it even cannot drag and drop/syncI have to use that web portal to upload the files slowly and the files went through internet and finally get back to my drive.
5,Works for what I wanted it to do for backup of files on my desktop and photos on my phone over WiFi.
1,This product has never worked properly has no software of its own and depends on Windows Backup feature. It uses so much memory that the computer cannot be used for even the simplest of tasks such as word processing. Tech support was of little help. Save your money or give it to Salvation Army. At least then you would get something for your money.
1,This is a small computer that you are adding to your network. A small out of date security hole that comes with instructions to turn off virus and malware defenses. Given the current situation with computer security WD could have done much better. This machine has been out of date for years and no software upgrades?? Really??
2,GOOD Upload to fast and easy drag and dropBAD Upload only video and picture on phoneBAD Not open doc htm except PDFBAD Not download a folder or many files
5,The best I cloud I ever have.
1,Updates made it useless and we have to access shared files online and only able to upload them online as well. only private folders can be a drive on your PC. The app is pointless to say the least. I have to update my folders and viewing settings in the app in order to see files accordingly. I am unable to see the names of my documents only icons.
5,Love this. Easily connected to my network and was able to set up auto backup so that I don't have to remeber to back it up!
1,Look this is great if all you want is to replace a Time Capsule or something.  It is not a proper NAS in that it can only be administered via an internet connection and all you can administer is the user language.WD claims it is PlexTV capable: it is not capable of transcoding video files and since it cannot accept a connection from other servers (Linux) it is useless to me.  Will be on EBAY for sale...Quite annoyed.
3,software/apps dont work well with it (eg Plex WD Backup etc.)
1,The latest update removed the ability to share folders on the drive with others on your network using the desktop app. They now force you to use only the web browser app or the mobile app to share. It basically bricked this drive for my family as we can't share between our computers without jumping through hoops.It used to work not anymore.
1,Lasted just over 12 months cost me 3 grand to get my files retrieved. Apart from that the concept is great access your files from any device anywhere in the world. Great if you travel for work. Make sure you back up on another drive though as you cannot access the files through the USB.
5,This is a up grade from my old one that came out years ago.  Just needed more storage.Montie
5,Don't understand why the comments are so negative. I'm using it without any problems. So easy to use.
1,This device works nothing like the my cloud. My cloud home removes any of the settings and configurations most everyone would need. It cannot stay connected since it using the my discovery application on a Windows 10 machine so every time I send large files it stops.I’m in the middle of a discussion with tech support and if they cannot solve th problem I will request them to replace it with the old model.
1,This product is rubbish I do not buy any more products of this brand I have bought 3 products and none worked well I do not recommend it this is a scam
1,You need to always be connected to the internet to use this product.It is not really a NAS it forces you to use the Website and it is missing a lot of features.It acts more like your own personal google drive if that is what you are looking for then this product if for you.
1,Unit would not power up initially.  Disconnected power and reconnected.  Unit powered up and light sequence occurred as required.  Tried to manually enter product key.  Unit would not accept code.  Went back to unit and noticed that the power was off again.  Disconnected power and reconnected to no avail.
1,A year REAL experience- Unusable USB connector always shows unsopported and undetectable usb sticks / ext drive- wireless transfer? EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW- Constantly disconnectsReal user adviseDO NOT BUY this garbage!!!
1,I used the WD 4TB My Coluf Home Personal Cloud Storage for four months. Then I gave him a small accidental blow when he was cleaning the table and it has broken down losing the whole data. I have had other devices and it never happened to me.I think it's better to save the data on a safe website like Google Drive DropBox or iCloud.
1,Do not buy this product. It is a piece of junk. I had mine for less then two years and now it's dead and if I want to retrieve my data I pay a 3rd party to extract the data."Western Digital does not provide data recovery services nor reimbursement for data recovery. "
5,Used it to back up my Mac. Works great
5,Works alright as Plex server with a single stream
1,you can't download entire folders from this drive which is NUTS! I'm stunned at how poorly designed the user experience is for a harddrive. Why in the hell would they design a harddrive that doesn't allow you to download entire files. You can't even select multiple files and download them at one time. You have to go through and download one file at a time. I'm a photographer so this is very inconvenient.
5,siempre conectado puedo guardar elementos desde cualquier parte del mundo diseño minimalista y lindo.
1,AWFUL !!!! Drive crashed in 48hrs ... tech support was useless and said I had to pay to get my data back !!!!! On a 48 hrs old item !!!!TERRIBLE !!!! DO NOT BUY
5,Setup was pretty simple getting devices hooked up was easy as well overall a decent cloud/LAN storage device for home.
1,NEVER PURCHASING A WD PRODUCT EVER AGAIN. This is an entry level storage method with zero capability beyond holding and sharing files. You CANNOT back it up. You can only Copy the files. You CANNOT plug in a USB drive and backup the contents of the MyCloud drive. It’s a terrible horrible system that I never dreamed could be so un-user-friendly.
1,bought this item to functions a network storage drive for my surveillance system. can not access it with an IP address also Blue Iris will not access it by drive letter. It is useless
1,No support and will only give you a 20% off coupon to buy another! F WD I'll never own another.....
1,returned it.  not a NAS devices this is an on premise cloud device.  makes no sense you have to use all things WD my cloud to access the devise.  WD my cloud is an online web site.  There does appear to be some folder sync capabilities but appeared to be limited to C drive only.  don't get attracted by low price you will regret it.
5,I have personally have bought at least a half-dozen of these. they are perfect for backup and file server for small businesses.
1,Did not work with my MacBook Pro. Was impossible to partition at least for me.
5,Todo llego perfecto y funciona muy bien.
3,Compact and very easy to install.
5,Great drive but transfering files to it from laptop is slowwwwwww.. you better have patience..
1,This product is worse than worst. There is no way to download folders from My Cloud Home to a phone.  I just spent two hours on the phone with customer support talking to multiple people.  I was finally told that the feature is disabled on the home version. You can only download individual files so if you want to keep a backup of say your music collection you would have to download each individual song.  If you have a large music collection that is impossible. Western Digital is misleading their customers.
1,RUN AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE! TOTAL CRAP!  Have to DIS-ASSEMBLE it to recover over 20 YEARS of data.  NICE job Western Digital.  SHAME on you!  I have two other hard drive BRICKS i will be using to drive 16 penny nails with too - I will NEVER EVER - E V E R buy anything from Western Digital again - EVER!
1,I've had nothing but problems with this drive.  After getting it connected I couldn't transfer anything reliably because the connection kept dropping.  Lots of review online (wish I'd read them) and I can not access the drive to update the firmware.  So now it's a $180 doorstop.  UGGHHH!!!
5,Very easy but lengthy setup. Totally automatic and hassle free operation. Will buy again!
5,Great product without any issue
1,In order to connect to it you have to install an app on every device. If you want to just map the network drive you have to buy the more expensive option. Copying the files from my computer took as long when I copied them to a cheap USB 3 drive connected to my router's USB port.
1,A big CRAP. After three months the fan that in theory should only turn on when the disc heats up turned on without reason and does not stop even when it has been disconnected for hours .... it was turned on for no apparent reason and has not stopped
5,Ez to set up and there are videos on YouTube to assist with other added features.
5,Compatible with current system
5,es lo que esperaba como producto y prestaciones su valor algo elevado mejorable las opciones en colores
5,Lots of storage and better than Dropbox where you have to buy more space.
5,Easy to use easy to set up
1,I had to return it this is not like the older "non home" clouds it's much more difficult to see in your network and to use for streaming. It is probably an awesome storage device though for backups etc..
3,Insufficient function
5,easy and helpfull
1,App is terrible. Does not work as expected. Back up time is unreasonable. Does not work like a remote dive can’t map to your file manager.
2,Not very useful.  Freezes up most of the time.  Not really worth the money
1,The device is always offline. It’ll occasionally come online and get offline right away. Not usable…
1,Incapable of remote access to videos and photos which is why I got it in the first place and lack of phone support to answer questions.  No capability to change photo image dates and groups currently uploaded photos to the current date.
3,I have 2 ea 4T MYCLOUD devices and 1 ea 1T older version.  WD my cloud is a super device but I cannot locate any dashboard or user control/ configuration features.  Its strength is a lot of storage and that is the BEST part.  WD seems to have dropped their support for backup utility or should I say the automated backup software available is no longer useful with the 4T devices I have.  Would love to put a UNIX shell on it but WD has larger platforms and has chosen not to let that happen.  There is very little available for the OS 3 versions.  Can I upgrade my 4T units to OS 5?
1,I regret buying this product. I'll never buy another WD device. Their softwre doesn't work—all that you can find are Mac users failing to make it work.
5,Nothing neg
5,Does all I want and more
1,Went offline and can't get it online again and too late to return. 2 months old
1,DO NOT GO HERE!!!... This is the worst waste of time and money EVER!!!.... Why anyone would release a product.....excuse me.... puzzle like this and call it an efficient product  I cannot fathom. I have replaced a unit and spent hours in tech support. Sounds like a great idea but ... its just not a viable storage solution
5,Excelente disco duro de manera de nube.
5,Quick transfers from my mobile devices
5,Good Quality
1,Would never buy again.  Can't access on local network?!? HAVE to use an app and internet to use my PHYSICAL drive?
5,Great product for the storage
5,Easy setup. Have been transferring files without issue so far
1,Won't appear as a drive on my network. Absolute trash. Don't waste your time or your money. I'm over WD and their products.
1,It will store you data but good luck getting their mobile app to sync your phone's contents to this thing.  It also has some PC software that will turn your supercomputer into a slouch.  Would not recommend.
1,Wasted a lot data on a backup that did not survive to 2 years. Dead and so if all my data.
1,As an IT professional for 30 years utterly disappointed that a quality company like WD would make such a weak product.No support for native Windows SMB network shares.Completely useless unless you have photos you want share.Similar to the Google Drive method.
1,Worked for a week then would not connect to my network.
1,You can't use any sort of back up with this drive!So if it fails you loose all of your data!!!!!!BUYER BEWARE! They are packaging as a less expensive alternative to their My Cloud NAS drives.
1,I had a WD MyCloud network hard drive and loved it. The MyCloud Home is crap. I access my files via the internet VERY SLOWLY when the device is sitting right next to me. I will likely toss it in the bin and NEVER buy another WD device.
1,this is out of control.  I just want an app like on a disc shipped with the product to set it up.  I don't want to have to reach across the internet to set it up.  WTF
1,This NAS device is hidden behind so much flawed WD software as to be unusable. After spending three hours trying to log into web portals download software having the device fail to show up in either and still not being able to map the thing to a drive letter I gave up.
5,the more i use this with my smartphone app the better it gets!! love it.
1,Way too slow to be useful.  Complete junk.
5,This works well and have had no issues with it.
1,The one thing it does do consistently is not work or connect....
1,This is NOT a normal NAS. It will allow you to store files on it using their software but don't expect to be able to access those files from other devices not running their software. Also standard Windows file sharing is not handled well.
1,The device is totally unsuitable as a backup drive.  I bought it to back up my Macbook Air and other Apple devices.  But the device is way too slow and the backup never finishes.  I sent it back.
5,Good
5,Works great and shipped quickly
1,Not great it crashes a lot and it's slow as hell
2,avoid this unit at all costs It will not work as you expect a network drive to.
5,It was easy to install and setup.
1,Very slow drive takes me about a week to backup one folder. It gets very confused if you try to back up more than one folder at a time. I like the idea of the web share but files are not immediately ready when you want or need them.
5,easy to install and easy to use
1,This is a NAS. It should plug into your network and be function as a mapped storage drive. Instead it REQUIRES. A desktop app to use.
5,Awesome great freedom to access your files. Very easy to set up
1,bought this w/o realizing you need to connect via an internet connection in order to access even within your house. Not sure it's because I'm using it outside the US but the drive looses connection etc.. Impossible to use. Had to move all data again to a "traditional" NAS.
1,This product just does not work.Bad interfaceBad speedBad productI sent it back
1,Could not get my computer to see this NAS. Read from WD that windows 10 is the issue. Well guess what?CAN'T ANYBODY MAKE SOMETHING THAT JUST WORKS????????????
1,The product is a complete failure comparing with its predecessor. The old model acts as proper storage device and access data locally within the network. Total disappointment. Planning to return it
1,Excited to get my music consolidated and accessible bought this to handle the job. Spent over 15 hours collecting/organizing the files and hooray - it's already bricked. More great news - factory reset is the solution to the incessantly throbbing white LED. What a waste of time this was.
5,Gift for my son. Does exactly everything he needs it to do.
1,The explanation of what it is is not clear in the product description.
5,Fantastic! Easy to use.
5,Easy setup and use
1,Stopped working within a month ... no power ...loaded private data so could not return
5,Easy and keeps pictures secure
1,I could not get the unit to work. I knew more than the tech support. They also made it very difficult to return.
1,Much Too Slow and too complicated to configure. Have no access w/o internet to configure it.USB port doesn't recognize connected external drives. Read/Write is much too slow to be useful.And not practical for Mac OS X Time Machine backup feature.I returned it.
5,Muy bueno.
5,Excelente producto muy bueno. Fácil de instalar.
5,Save photos and release phone space
5,Works great I am glad I bought it.
1,Lousy product.  Purchased 2 units and returned both units for operation failure.
5,Excelente
1,Slow
1,Limited accessibility.  Everything is controlled and I can only upload up to maximum 5gb a file anything more than that I have exceeded upload limit.
1,Freezes and doesn’t fully copy all your data.  For 3 days I was trying to backup my data.  The drive doesn’t copy everything freezes slow and unreliable.  Returning it back
1,product absolutely refuses to connect. and is literally unusable. reached out to customer support and was given the run around and then disconnected do not recommend
5,Works great and loving the space on this.
5,Liked the product
1,I bought one of these devices and it would not boot.  I did a return for another one and it did not boot also. Do not buy this product they are not reliable. Buy another vendor.
1,Paid too much for a BRICK. Once connected the device was unresponsive to the setup link provided in the instructions. After performing a factory reset the device would not even obtain an IP address. Complete waste of money and time.
1,I would not recommend this memory storage. The app is not well designed and never works. I has been uploading the same pictures and videoos over and over again. It is very disappointing I really was expecting a better version of the wd cloud.
1,Item I reseived was open and sealed. It contained wrong power supply.
1,Scrolls randomly through pictures making it impossible to manage photos. Bought this unit because the previous one crashed and support was worthless. Thought I would give them another chase.
5,Great improvement to the already Great system.
5,At this point this product works great.
1,Sent it back
5,Really like the features.
1,Worked great for 4 months and then died. Now dealing with warranty support but it doesn't do my lost files any good. The WD backup device needs a backup device.
1,Waste of money and time. Could not automatically back up photos until I manually started to add some. Then the automated upload started and duplicated my files 8 times. Sending it back and buying a regular My Cloud.
5,works great
1,Not a NAS device.  Cannot be managed locally.  Cannot be assigned a static IP address netmask DNS etc.  I am sending this back.  I wish that I had read the user reviews prior to purchasing but I have owned several WD NAS drives before and never imagined that WD would intentionally take these sorts of drives in a different direction.
5,excellent I recommend them very responsible
5,Awesome
1,This device has to use the WD software to access the drive.  There is no way to make it work like a normal nas.  The software you have to used is half baked at best.
1,Terrible design can only manage it when connected to the internet can't manage locally at all.  Product still responds on port 80 and 443 even though they removed the useful interface.  No option to turn off remote management (as that's the ONLY management method).  Bye don't need another stupid internet connected facing device that is inevitably going to have security holes.
2,Bought this from a box retailer as a replacement for an older version of MyCloud that is no longer supported. I was completely wrong to assume the Home version is the same as the MyCloud version.The Home version is great if all you want to do is save backups or files that you can access anywhere. Unfortunately if you want to work on the file (i.e. Word or Excel) you cannot work on the copy that is on Home. You have to save it locally and THEN you can work on it. But when you save it it does not save it back to the Home device. You have to manually save the file. And when you save the file it does not overwrite the original file. If it is saved with the same filename it will append the filename with "(1)" because it is a duplicate name. It's a disgrace that you can't work on the file directly from Home.The way I set up Home is to have it sync with my home desktop. Anytime a file is updated on the PC it automatically updates Home. If you update the Home version of the file it syncs back to the PC. (This is through the WD Discovery app.) The point in setting it up this way is so I can work on files away from home and it would be consistently updated between the home PC and the Home device. However whenever you work on the file when I'm away from the house and copy it back to the Home device I will constantly have filenames that have (1) (2) (3) etc. This is NOT the way it should work.If you are only looking to store pics it works great. However don't be misled by WD. This device is an overpriced piece of garbage for anything else!
1,I bought this equipment. Even though it said it was easy and quick to install. I've had awful trouble trying to get My Cloud to work on my office network. Would not recommend at all.
5,Works well. No concerns.
1,This product did not work from the begging.  just never responded DO NOT BUY
5,easy to use!
1,When you copy files from one unit to another the transfer speed is horribly slow :-(
1,Never worked consistently.  Lots of connection problems.  Connection from Mac never worked.  Finally thirty-three days after purchase it died.I will never buy a WD drive again.
1,Item is seen on computer and CMD but can not get it to see on network.
5,I love it.
5,Ok
5,Great
1,Security is very poor on this device.. Very easily hackable. Don't buy
5,Great product
1,This item worked for about 2 months and then it just died.
1,This device locks up your computer. The cloud software interface is pitiful.
5,Ok
5,Works perfect.
1,Nothing about this is usable.
1,Extremely limited functionality. Do not recommend.
1,Don't buy if you have any desire for a product that plays nice with iTunes or Sonos.
1,You cannot setup and use without Internet.I hate products like this and I am returning it.
5,Never failed until the moment very easy to use great back up
1,Right from box was defected
1,Its not the best thing WD has made. BUT IF YOU UPDATE IT WITH THE NEW release.... ITS AWESOME
1,not compatible with Catalina OS
1,Apparently it doesn’t work well with videos taken on the iPhone. What’s the point?
1,I had one of these drives fail (an earlier version) and I lost all my data because it didn't have a backup to my backup....thats on me.So I go buy the 2 bay of the updated model: First SURPRISE it doesn't work on the new macs with the integrated chips but they PROMISE they will fixit by july 2021. Instead WD discontinues support for this drive and I still can't get it to connect to my mac or network.It's shows up every time but only has 5mb of space available on it.What tomfluckery is this?Buy mine used from me. I'll give you a real deal
1,Caution: does not work with Catalina
1,Very slow software is horrible. I would not recommend this for photos or videos.
2,The above photo of albums is misguiding. When you create an album to share the only thing visible of the content are icons. You have no control of the icons. Videos show the first frame as an icon. IMPOSSIBLE to determine what videos to select. Beware if you plan to share content with family and friends. They will be unable to decipher the icons. It took many calls to WD support before they would admit that it is impossible to display video or photo names in a shared album. Look for another solution.
1,The most confusing piece of computer hardware I have ever seen.
1,It can’t run like NAS!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I’m really impressed with how easy it was to setup and that it has 4 TB of storage
1,Have had this for over a year. Of 2 laptops it has shown up on one most of the time. It has never worked with the other one. When it doesn't connect you can find many things to try online. This is apparently not unusual. I have spent countless hours going through procedures that claim to make it work sometimes successfully and sometimes not but always 100% frustrating. If it connects it's great but it is so inconsistent and frustrating I have come to distrust and hate it. I just want to get the data off of it and get a reliable portable hard drive. I don't know how some people seem to think this works. Look up "can't connect to mycloud"  or "can't find mycloud"  and you will find countless links. I will never trust WD again. I would not recommend this!
3,WD please continue to improve it.
3,so got a message to update to OS WD 5 but found out the my 4tb version of this device is not compatible and no longer supported it still works as a local has drive which is fine but no support or updates security or otherwise. so just consider that before you purchase this also bought mine 4 month ago brand new and already discontinued.
4,I currently have three different WD drives of varying sizes and ages that are used for Windows back-ups for computers and mobile devices. This My Cloud Home Duo (MCHD) drive has the capacity to consolidate into one place and because it has mirrored discs it protects against loss of back-ups something I’ve had happen in the past--for that purpose it works well. I am able to store my most valuable data—back-ups music photos videos etc. and access them from anywhere through my network or the internet.Setup is straightforward connect to a Wi-Fi router with the supplied two foot Ethernet cable and plug-in. When the light on the drive glows steadily white the device is ready to use. To control the unit a computer is not necessary. Go to the website on a mobile device log-in or create a My Cloud account and then after the device is detected follow the steps to configure. Next download the My Cloud app from Apple App store or Google Play. I am using an iOS device and encountered no problems.In order to copy the back-ups I plugged two of the drives into the back of the MCHD (there are only two ports on the device) using USB-cables. From the mobile app the drives were automatically detected and an option to copy appeared on the screen. I selected both drives and it began copying in the background. When they finished I connected the third drive and copied it as well. The duplication progress is displayed on the mobile device screen. Copying all three back-ups took almost 24 hours.I did try to copy another brand of drive along with five different USB jump drives and the app did not recognize them. Looking for a solution I loaded the PC app called WD Discovery from the website and once loaded the MCHD appears in Windows as a network drive.At that point I could connect the jump drives and the other brand of hard drive and drag and drop them onto the MCHD.  The disadvantage is that it uses the Windows copy function so it effectively ties-up/slows down the computer. This will hopefully be addressed in future updates.The auto back-up feature for photos and videos from a smart phone worked well. They were automatically added to the WCHD from my iPhone. I also tried the automatic internet cloud storage back-up with Google Drive and OneDrive it works fine.The documentation states that it works seamlessly with Windows Back-Up but I tried it with two Windows 10 laptops and neither were recognized as a valid Windows Back-Up drive. This necessitates creating the back-up on a local drive and then dragging and dropping it to the MCHD which is time consuming and inconvenient. Another issue that hopefully will be addressed in future updates.I also copied music and video libraries to the MCHD and they can now be accessed by any device connected to my home network or internet. The fact that I do not have to open a port from the outside through my internet router anymore to get to my internal data keeps my home network secure. After a week of use no issues.
1,I purchased Western Digital 8 TB My Cloud Home external drive about three years ago. It worked FAIRLY DECENT until about 3 months ago. It has lost connection and can no longer connect. It simply states it's offline. I've tried every solution possible and still no luck. I purchased this product because I thought it would be reliable and I could trust that whatever I needed to store would always be available to me. What is the point of having an external hard drive with a cloud feature if you cannot access the cloud unless the device is logged in? And the customer service is absolutely nonexistent. They want me to collect and send them logs of the device but in order to do that you have to log in. I disregarded many signs while having the device and it was still functioning. It took forever to simply log in it took forever to download what I needed from the device difficulty logging in and having to restart computer multiple times to get the device to finally log in and on and on and on. I will absolutely never purchase a product from your company again. I lost so many personal and professional things and there is absolutely nothing that can be done because there is not a single human being that works for Western Digital that is capable of figuring out why their devices are worth nothing more than a 2.5-pound paper weight. There are a few choice words I have for your company but I will display more professionalism than what I have received. DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCTS FROM THIS COMPANY.
4,This is my second NAS the first being a much older QNAP 4-bay system. If you take anything away from this review let it be this: if you're looking for something that can operate independently of any given machine on your network something that can be configured via local web interface and mapped as a network drive without any intermediate software doing it for you this may not be the NAS for you. On the other hand if you don't want to worry about configuration and you just want it to be as easy as possible to back up data or to access files across computers and/or across networks and over the internet this might be your NAS.Basically any sharing options require the use of WD software which tends to get in the way more than anything. What I had hoped for was a NAS that I could attach to the internet access via local IP in a web browser configure and map as a network drive on my local machines. That's the way the QNAP works. But the WD requires that you install their software on each computer and phone before you can map the drive. Once you do you'll start getting notifications on the screen every time the drive does something which is annoying.The WD NAS has none of the features that I love about the QNAP. There's no SSH no accessible web server no suite of tools to take the load off of your desktop(s). Raid configuration options are minimal: mirror or not.Here's the thing though and this is why I've rated it four stars instead of less: it's not really intended to be a full-blown NAS. They don't even refer to it as that. They call it "Personal Cloud Storage" which is a much better description of its capabilities. This is for people that want a basic no-fuss way to back up their data locally and still have access to that data from remote locations.As an example my phone automatically backs up the camera roll to the WD every time I'm on my home Wi-Fi (it turns off the backup if you're in battery saver mode or off the wi-fi). So the other day I was at a concert for a band that has a unique thing that they bring out at the end of every show. I pulled out my phone and got a video of it and later a friend wanted me to send him the video. Rather than send him the whole thing directly in an MMS (which I think might have added additional compression) I just opened it from the WD app after it got backed up created a share link to it and sent my friend the link.If I want to I can have documents or maybe software I'm working on sitting on the drive and I'd be able to access it from anywhere while still having it locally on my network. For things like this the WD does the job just fine. I guess the moral of the story is: don't expect functionality from a device when the device isn't designed to serve that purpose. If you want an actual NAS from Western Digital   they have them         marketed to "prosumers and creative professionals". I haven't used them though. I'll stick with my trusty QNAP.
5,The app is great to take things from your cloud to send to anyone else
3,The WD 12TB WDBMUT0120JWT-NESN my cloud home dual drive personal cloud storage made in Thailand comes with the Home Duo Ethernet cable AC adapter and quick install guide.  Installation is simply plugging the unit into the network and power.  Then the cloud storage boots up and is ready for use.    There are android and apple My Cloud Home Mobile apps plus a WD Discovery desktop app which should be installed on all your connected devices.  To prepare your devices install the appropriate app create an account sign in and update desired settings.  The My Cloud Home Dual starts taking backups and manages itself from there.  Also activity can be viewed files and photos/videos can be browsed and settings can be changed.   The iPad app works in portrait mode by default and also in landscape mode.  When the app is opened on the iPad in landscape mode the app oddly opens in portrait mode.  Rotating the iPad around will get the app to reposition in landscape mode. Renaming backup files is problematic too.  I can rename the existing files for organization and consistency but then the app creates a duplicate file with the original name and backups all the contents again.  There doesn't seem to be a way to custom name the backup anywhere.  Additionally the My Cloud Home Mobile app only backs up photos and videos on mobile devices while other file types are not. I use my iPad for productivity purposes if I create a word document on the iPad I want it backed up too.  The only direct option is to save my document to the cloud and manually do so with older documents.  The WD Discovery desktop app creates a networked drive on the desktop for direct access to files.  However the desktop app doesn't back up any files. I can only schedule a backup to save to the drive or manually upload files I want cloud access to.    The apps have a social and Cloud Import tool to gather all your files from various web sources including Dropbox Google drive OneDrive and Facebook.  By configuring for any of the options including some not listed the My Cloud Home Dual will back up those cloud sources as well.  Files will be updated and deleted along with the source so recovery is not an option on the My Cloud Home Duo.  Other service options to expand functionality includes Channels DVR Plex server Alexa skills IFTTT Sonos and Network importing.  The My Cloud Home Dual is set up for 6TB of storage with two disks set at RAID1.  This setup protects your data in the case a hard drive fails.  The my cloud home dual drive can also be set to full capacity mode so that all 12TB are available but the data is at greater risk of loss if a hard drive should fail.  I would strongly suggest that RAID1 be used unless the data doesn't matter or you have an alternate effective backup plan in place.  The my cloud home dual drive compares well with a service like Drop Box which shouldn't be the standard for a personal machine.  DropBox automatically backs up my photos and videos while ignoring other file types.  I can access those files from any connected device as well as any I manually place on DropBox.  The main difference is that I can edit my office documents by accessing DropBox on the web while I cannot do that with the my cloud home dual drive.  Instead I have to purchase the app I want to work with which increases the cost of using this drive.  If you're looking for a way to get away from a hosted cloud and manage your own the WD 12TB WDBMUT0120JWT-NESN my cloud home dual drive personal cloud storage will only get you part way there.  Additionally being a home-based storage drive there should be common NAS functionality included.  This cloud storage device does a lot of things right it just doesn't go far enough.  I will continue to use the WD 12TB WDBMUT0120JWT-NESN my cloud home dual drive personal cloud storage and will also continue to make use of DropBox on the go.  PROS: Simple start-up Auto backs up photos and videos from mobile devices Raid1 option helps protect your files from hard drive crashes Files accessible from all your connected devices 2-year limited warranty  CONS: The app lacks basic functionality Only auto backs up photos and videos from mobile devices no other file types Limited desktop functionality
1,This drive only lasted a few months for me.  Very unreliable difficult to setup and a total waste of money.  Please don't waste your money on this piece of junk like I did.
2,I've never seen a drive function this slowly. All the windows drivers up to date gigabit network 50mb up internet connection and still it is a miserable experience regardless if external or on the same network. I've also tried moving the unit to work to see if maybe it just didn't like my home network and got the same trash performance.A directory with 82 images takes 10-15 seconds to populate. Trying to even open up a 54kb picture can take 20 seconds! I figured i had to have a lemon unit so i returned and the replacement is just as bad.Idk what the intended use for this thing is but it is very clearly not a functional dropbox replacement. Tried talking to the Indian call center tech support WD is using dude acted like he didn't have a clue what i was talking about and told me to just replace the unit. This model is trash.Android app is nice windows integration style is clean and easy. Aside from deplorable access times it seems like a nice setup.
4,To  install and use the  WD 4TB Duo Personal Cloud Storage I have to say first that I am not strongly computer literate and did have questions for my programmer son. Though everything seemed easy and uncomplicated in the installation of the unit and programs I did have a problem.I plugged the unit into my modem downloaded the appropriate programs into my computer and Android phone. Everything seemed to work and I downloaded my picture files into the WD. As I did this I realized that my photos were a mess with nothing organized through the years. I had over 4500 photos. I deleted the photos from the WD and spent the next 8 hours organizing my photos in the computer. At that point I again loaded the files into the WD. This was done and then I went to use Netflix for some relaxation. My internet which is only 3 megs max went to nothing. I did a speed test on the computer and it would not even download the program ( it said not enough speed to test ) so had no way to tell what the speed was. To make a long story shorter it didn't work for about 18 hours.I contacted the internet provider and he said their end was working fine. I contacted WD and couldn't really get across my problem to them (language problem) but did find out that the file did not go into an internet site like Myspace. It only went into the My Cloud unit sitting behind my computer. I contacted my son he had only one possible problem. The large file caused some change on the internet to make it go more slowly but he was not even convinced of this. I could still get email at times but very slowly.I'm not sure if my very slow internet speed does not work well with The WD My Cloud or if it just a coincidence. I would be glad to hear from anyone with other thoughts on this. I did try uninstalling My Cloud programs and unplugging it. No change in internet speed. Two days later all was working.I have all of my organized files now on the My Cloud and can access them easily on my computer or from my phone which is very nice. It came in very handy to have all pictures available on my phone. I have had to manually add photos to My Cloud from my pictures file on my phone and other files on the computer though as I understand it it should do that automatically. In any case it is nice to have everything accessible and saved for the future. I'm not sure whether a greater internet speed is necessary for My Cloud.
3,I have been a long term user of Dropbox. I also pay for iCloud for sharing of photos between my family's phones and iPads. I also use alexa Show. So I got this an attempt to pull together my storage needs and stop with the annual or monthly fees.In the end I think I am going to keep paying for the services I have been paying for because this isn't quite easy enough or robust enough for my uses.There are basically no instructions but it is pretty easy to set up. Plug it in and then create the account and then download the mobile app. I was pretty frustrated with the mobile app not allowing me to sign in. I looked around for a solution and didn't find any real help. What fixed it was restarting my phone. Once I did that it worked fine.I like the autobackukp for phone pictures. It really works better and more naturally that the iCloud sync to my mac does.What I don't like is that there is no good way I have found to stream music from the fileserver to the phone without using plex. This is more a limitation of the iPhone iOS than the mycloud software. But despite that I will continue to use either the Amazon music app or iTunes. I pay $25 a year for iTunes Match to give me all of our family music. It isn't much and it is a much easier system than the mycloud using plex.The backup speed was pretty reasonable. Not as fast as a wired connection but quite good for a wireless one. You can also connect dropbox to the drive to import your dropbox (or GoogleDrive or Box etc). This makes importing data easy.Mycloud works differently from dropbox. You have a sync section and then the online/server only section. Dropbox allows you access everything and keep everything synced whether you want it on your computer or not. Dropbox is better for syncing multiple computers but the mycloud system is fine for a backup/storage system for a single computer.As part of the same system that will import dropbox you can import photos from Google Photo or Facebook which is a nice backup idea but that should be duplicate of all of the photos I already have.I tried to use alexa to play my music because I am not paying for amazon music to have a full copy of my music to play on Alexa. This never worked for me. I turned the skill on but could never link accounts. It just hung. I tried on two computers and three browsers. So not sure what was wrong there.If you are thinking about an online storage system I think this is probably a good option for individuals or a small business that has some storage backup needs with ability to remotely access photos or simple files. If I had started here I probably would be happy with this. But I am fairly set in my ways with my current system and this doesn't really work as well as the current system for all parts of my needs.I can't stop using iTunes Match (although there is the potential that this will support itunes streaming in the future). I can't play music on my alexa device. It backs up my photos well and I think this is the only part that works better than my current system.As a file backup system this is fine. It does allow me to share files with others. You can also invite others to have a private section of the server themselves. This is a good idea for family to have private areas or for a friend to do an off site backup. This isn't that expensive but you could buy it and share the space with someone else. I have the 2GB system but the 4 GB system is only $40 more and the 6 GB system is about $80 more. These would be a fairly low cost sharing option for a small photographer or designer.I am going to keep playing with it but I think right now at least. I will keep my current system and either use this as a backup or give it away to a friend that is starting their online backup from scratch.
1,Be careful you understand what you are buying.  This cloud solution basically forces all connections to this device to require an internet connection.  Your internet goes down?  This is a brick until service is restored.  So while data transfer at least is local there is always a dependency on western digital's cloud with no local backup.Don't use this for long term storage either as you could lose access if the service is changed in the future and this specific device stops being supported.Further the WD Discovery software causes massive slowdowns on Windows due to the fact cloud based connections will never be as fast as a disk in your computer and having windows look at it all the time (Quick Access's flaw) will cause everything to slow down.  And there is no obvious way to opt out of that link and you must run WD Discovery to access the drive.  So slow Windows ensues.So this is a cloud storage solution that takes the worst of local hardware and cloud storage and forces convenience to kill productivity.
4,It isn't spelled out on the packaging of this device that you MUST log on through their servers to access your own home network.I bought one of these but I'm probably going to return it because it seems like a great opportunity for them to rummage through our data looking for something interesting.I did want to spell how how the device works and get the feedback from the more technical community to figure out how this system works.1. It connect to my home network gets a DHCP address and phones home to Western Digital with it's Identifier code. This identifies you to them through your home IP Address which is uniquely attributable to YOU as a customer through your ISP.2. I log on to their website and enter that same code.3. This identifies me to them ties me to the device.4. When a device logs on through whatever device it connects to that device ID linking me to my data drive at home.Unknown: How does traffic come and go through my firewall at home?Wouldn't I have to configure the firewall with a permit to Western Digital servers to permit me access to the drives on my home network?Again. I'm pretty sure I'm returning this thing b/c I don't trust it and don't like having to identify myself to them to use a piece of hardware.*** Update: I actually really like this device. I got lazy about returning it b/c it's a 2 hour drive both ways so I plugged it in and tested it out a bit and it's really neat!I canceled my Amazon Web server online storage because of this drive.Basic Operation:1. Plug into your home network.2. Log in to the western digital site and enter the code that comes with your drive.3. It couples the two so that you log on to their site to access your home drive. (I didn't like their involvement in the process but it helps with access and security through the internet into your home network.)4. Install the software on either PC or MAC to have the drive appear as a locally-attached disk drive making it super-easy to use.I connected it to a smart home plug so I can turn it on when I'm not at home and access my files from anywhere on earth.I like it so much I might upgrade to the dual disk drive that provides added reliability because the drives mirror each other so that one of the drives can fail and your data will still be available.
3,I have long been of fan of WD drives and personal clouds and currently own several of their products. When I got the chance to try out the home duo cloud I jumped. The biggest plus was that due to its removable dual drive nature additional portable drives are not needed for back up storage. So a 12tb machine only has 6tb of actual storage with the other 6tb used to back up the primary memory. I also liked the dedicated on/off button (although not designed in the best possible place). Use is simple and easy just drop and drag.What I didn’t like is a lot. You cannot connect via wifi (really WD!?!) you must use a dedicated lan cable. You can view content directly through the cloud drive using a dedicated app but you cannot push using apple tv. If you own more than one of these duo clouds you HAVE to use different email addresses for each cloud. I learned this the hard way of spending hours trying to figure out why I couldn’t connect and access the 6tb duo cloud I purchased. It wasn’t until i spent hours on the phone waiting to talk to a WD rep that I was advised of the need for different email address for each unit. (Really WD?!?) You also cannot connect to multiple duo drives simultaneously like you could if you had multiple portable dives connected to your computer as the app portal is only capable of singular access. (Ugh)I did have one odd experience. I had both duo clouds on continuously for about two weeks and went to add data and got an error msg staying “could not find drive hardware may be corrupted”... on both machines!! (WT@$#&%!.) I was more than upset as I had just spent days transferring 8tb of information that I thought was lost. After a brief contemplation of deciding whether or not to call WD customer service and lowering the boom I took a less stressful approach. I took a leap of faith and put WD back up capabilities to the test. If this device truly works the way its supposed to then If I do a reset the back up info should come online. After multiple attempts I wasn’t having any luck. So I decided to complete one last reset and wait. That did the trick. Waiting for about 15-20 minutes after a reset the info was back online. What a relief.I must say my experience was an exhausting and stressful one. I never experienced this sort of drama when using thier home clouds. My hope is that WD reads these reviews and corrects their design and mfg missteps on future product rollouts/updates.
1,I actually wasn’t going to leave a review but at one point the app wouldn’t let me continue with out leaving a review so since they feel that it is so important to not let me use the product without one here we are it’s slow they are cutting out most of the apps the transfer rate is extremely slow for what it should be capable of the app lacks basically anything you could want from an app and there customer service is laughable. So thank you western digital for forcing me to leave a bad review
4,I have a few NAS devices - I shoot a LOT of photos sometimes 4000 over one weekend  so I need a lot of storage and I only use RAID. What's the use of backing up to a drive and have it fail?  This NAS RAID device is what I'd call "RAID for Dummies." You can't change anything it's pretty well automated and will copy music photos email and more across your network or even online services based on keywords. Settings (users passwords features to activate) are handled via Android or iOS apps or desktop software. Again the interface is simplified. Running the discovery program creates a shared drive and adds it to your drive list automatically so you don't need to know how to do any "techy stuff" with your computer.  You can set up automated accounts for multiple users and more with just a few clicks. It even supports Windows and iOS backups.What I don't like is that they advertise it as 4 TB of storage.  It's 1.75 TB of storage.  That's because everything is stored twice (RAID) and there's storage space required by the system itself. That's still  enough for most people.  I'm also more of a techie and like the option to change things. RAID levels number of visible drive letters and so on. FYI this uses RAID 1 also called mirroring.Annoyances: You need to setup an online account to use the Home Duo. There's virtually no online help. You can find a PDF file if you look long enough. I guess the idea is that if it's simple enough to use you won't have any questions. The USB ports really should be on the front as they are for copying files from other devices and not intended to permanently hook up external devices/drives. This means you need to spin the housing around if you want to plug in a thumb-drive etc.Inputs: Power (12V) two USB 3.0 (for copying files) and the network interface.If you're looking for a simple versatile plug and play RAID device that's easy-peasy this is for you. If you are more of a tech-head or like tinkering with settings you'll be frustrated.
1,I am not sure why WD is selling this product line. Their other product line has many of the features I think this device should have. This device feels like a cheap after thought compared to other NAS.  You are forced to use their super slow app. Every time I try to copy large amounts of pictures Windows freezes. Their “social plug in” creates tons of duplicates because every time you start an import instead of knowing what it already imported it just imports all your google photos or Facebook pics. Without duplicates I had 800 GB of photos.. imagine how many I have now?
4,As other reviewers have noted this unit has it's limitations which depending on your needs may disqualify it from consideration. I find it useful overall and will give 4 stars though the following must be noted:Set-up: The unit is incredibly easy to get started with including a picture instruction card highlighting the simplicity: Plug it into the modem. plug it into the wall. Visit the website and away you go.Interface: One of the potential drawbacks depending on your needs. The drives are only accessible via the mobile or desktop apps. As in you cannot connect directly to a computer as with a traditional external drive. The app interface is clean and simple but very limited as to what you can do within and not very intuitive to navigate. There may just be a learning curve/something I'm missing. If so I'll return to revise.Speed: Since all data transfer takes place over your home WiFi I assume the speed of transfer is dependent on your network speed/conditions. For me It appears to run neither noticeably fast nor dreadfully slow. Nothing to compliment or complain about.NOTE on the above 2 points: Perhaps you could connect the unit directly to a computer since there is a USB input for flash drives and external drives but I can't confirm it works like that.Build/Design: The unit is attractive. There is an indicator light that is pretty nice but fairly large and may or may not be worth the energy it takes to power. The unit is not too heavy but feels solid. I have noticed a couple of times so far where the unit is generating a noticeable amount of noise while operating. The USB ports are on the back. Which is not ideal as you need to access the back to attach a removable drive.Overall I can't say I love it. I'll keep using it for a while but the online-only aspect coupled with the slightly awkward interface options knock it down a little for me. It does have a ton of storage and the automated aspect of the process as well as the accessibility of anyone in the home makes it a worthwhile purchase for those who know what they're getting here.
3,The WD 4TB My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud is easy to use but very limited in its functionality.To start you just plug it into your network and visit the mycloud website no need to read any documentation it steps you right though the setup.One Central Place To Store And Organize Everything - Yes and this is easy you have your own PRIVATE storage and can sync many sources from social media phone desktop cloud storage providers. All easy to set up and it works well. It is only accessible to you you can not share your files.Everything Saved Twice - Using the default RAID1 keeps data copied on two drives so if one dies you can replace it and not lose data but the effective storage is 2TB. You can switch to JBOD and access the full 4TB but if either drive fails you loose everything.Desktop Sync - Easy to use but the single sign on app has to be logged in. Authentication is done in the app which also maps a drive to your own private disk space. Easy to use but no ability to be creative using different accounts to share files with others.For Linux you can access the drive as a non authenticated user over the LAN and mount a Public directory. But this space is not mounted as an authenticated user. On a PC you would need to start up a second mount to share this Public directory.Services/Apps available for each individual user arePlex - a media management service that can be used with streaming devices such as a smartTV Roku AppleTV etc.Social and Cloud Import - sync with Dropbox Google Drive OneDrive Box Facebook Google PhotosMy Cloud Alexa Skill - Connects you to your music collection on your My Cloud Home. Use your voice to play a specific song songs by artist and more. Keep in mind the limitation that the services only work with your private space so you can not share a music library with more than one user or use files in the Public directory.IFTTT - many uses here save gmail attachments save tagged facebook photos save instagram etc.All in all there is a lot of good here unfortunate that it is so locked up with no ability to share or access without going through the WD Discover locked door.
3,I was excited to try out the 12TB version  of the My Cloud Home Duo cloud storage device. I have seen the reviews and the criticism that it needs to be always connected to the internet which is weird but somewhat understandable given the nature of this device and the "on the go" access it gives you. I would say that if having it connected to the internet all the time is a concern for you don't even consider buying this and move on. There are plenty of NAS devices that don't act as remotely accessible cloud storage and are available on your LAN to play movies act as storage etc.Basically it's this device is a cross between a NAS and a cloud storage device that you keep in your house. The data is backed up twice and it can automatically back up photos and videos from your phone. It's somewhat slow and I was able to use it for some streaming video but at higher resolutions it didn't work well. I just don't think that's what this is really made for. It does a great job of backing up video and photos from your devices and for storing files but again if you have sensitive files and are not comfortable with this being connected to the internet to work that could be a problem. This is a consumer focused device and not intended for extremely sensitive documents. I do think there is a market for this sort of thing but don't get this thinking it's a traditional NAS to be used as a video server or you will be disappointed. It's much more of a cloud storage device that you keep in your home and can easily disconnect if needed which is an advantage over storing your data in Google's cloud.Aside from all that the device was easy to set up works great with both PC and Apple computers at the same time and is packaged in a clean design that you can keep in your home office or tucked away near your router or switch. It's easy to access the hard drives and remove them if needed. So this isn't a "bad" product it just might not be what people are looking for when buying a 12GB storage device for their home. It's kind of nice having a big storage area to put all the photos and video from your various devices without worrying about it suddenly disappearing from some online storage site. So I've been using it for storing files which I used to do on a spare PC hard drive and it's been working great and it's nice to be able to use my phone to pull up any old photo I want since they are all available anywhere because this device is always connected to the internet.I had trouble rating this item. I feel like 1 star is ridiculous. The product works fine for what it says it does. 5 stars is much too high. It works well for storing and accessing photos from my phone and DSLR but it seems slow and isn't able to stream high resolution data very well to my TV at least not on my home network. I've decided to rate it 3 stars because it's fine and it's easy to set up and use but it isn't blowing me away. I would love to see an option to keep this device on my local area network if I want and not have to keep it always connected to the internet. I realize that isn't the primary function of this thing but it would be a nice feature for advanced users. I suppose there are less expensive options for something like that and this is a speciality "cloud storage" device.
5,Despite a serious lack of included instructions on how to use this wireless storage device I've come to love the My Cloud Home Duo.  It is both a media server and a back-up storage device.  I can snap photos on my phone in say California and have them automatically backed up at home across the country using cellular data (if I enable that setting) or Wi-Fi.  I can place important files on it that I might need later and retrieve them remotely.  I can even back up my entire computer on it.  With the ability to add users my husband can also share the My Cloud Home Duo.  Because the Duo has mirrored storage (the 4 TB version has two 2 TB drives) I should theoretically have all my data safely stored even if one of the drives fails.  But if you want all 4 TB of storage you can change the default in the app settings to access both drives independently.  The power of this device earns its five stars as long as you're willing to put it the time to figure out the features.  I'll try to answer some questions below but expect to spend time on the WD support page to figure out how to use your My Cloud Home.The only instructions in the box is a small card that shows the WD My Cloud Home connecting to what could be a modem or a router maybe even a desktop tower.  The answer?  It's a router unless you have a modem/router combo and then it's that.  You connect the My Cloud Duo to one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the router using the included cable or one of your own.  And plug it in.  That's all.  Simple right?  Um no.  This device is definitely not for the plug-and-go crowd because it requires some online investigation to figure out and utilize its features.  You need to download the software for all devices including your computer to use it for anything more than a drag-and-drop storage device.  Again not a big deal.  The first issue I ran into however was the difference between public and private storage one of which can be accessed remotely and the other which cannot. Neither are adequately explained on the website. (On the website Western Digital shows how you can tell on a PC but not a Mac.)  I believe -- and I may be wrong -- that anything added directly to the My Cloud by dragging and dropping has local access only.  If you use the app to add it you can access it remotely.  So far that has worked.  That said you can also create a "shared link" that you generate by right clicking on a file or folder.  Copy that and send to the people you want to share it with.  It's not secure because anyone with the link can access those files; however it acts just like DropBox in that multiple people can remotely access it.The My Cloud Home comes with five "services":  Plex Social and Cloud Import My Cloud Alexa Skill; IFTTT; and Network Import.  Plex can take all of your media music and video and place it on the My Cloud Home for remote or local access; the basic version to organize media is free but they do have paid premium services to upgrade if you want.  The Social and Cloud Import can sync with your cloud storage on Dropbox Google Drive OneDrive Box Facebook and Google Photos to import back up and keep files up to date.  The Alexa skill allows you to play your My Cloud music (not just the stuff you've stored on Amazon) by saying "Alexa ask my Cloud to play Party Playlist."  The Network Import is used only to import the files from an older My Cloud device to the newer My Cloud Home. I'm still trying to figure out Plex to connect all my music to my Sonos player using this app.My biggest complaint about this drive is how long it takes to access the contents of large folders such as a complete back-up of iPhone photos.  If I want to access files on the road I have to move them beforehand to a smaller folder that won’t take so long to load.  I’m okay with this limitation since I don’t really need to access my photos — they ARE just a back-up — but it could be a pain if you remove your photos from your phone yet want to show someone a specific one saved on My Cloud Home.  Good luck finding it without knowing the name of the IMG file.  Because I view this drive as a cloud back-up of photos however I can’t justify removing a star for it.I love that I have physical possession of my personal cloud with 2TB of personal storage saved on two drives or alternately 4TB stored with only one copy.  This is a powerful hard drive to have in your home since it does so much more than store files.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
1,This storage was great... but starting April 15 (i.e. 5 days from now) this device will no longer be accessible from a cell phone because it can't be upgraded to the "new" my cloud OS5 app. It will only be accessible from a local computer. I can't believe they aren't warning people and are still selling these expensive paperweights!
3,The My Cloud Duo is a storage device which takes a different approach. Ensure that you understand what you are purchasing prior to doing so. This is not a true Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. WD had attempted to simplify the typical NAS approach and as a result has created something unique (unique doesn't mean good or bad remember).The MyCloud Duo can be accessed on your local network and can be mapped with the WD software installed but it does take this hybrid cloud storage approach which requires you to sign up for a WD Cloud account and does the redirection of the Windows\iOS\Andriod apps. This has and will create privacy concerns - if you want to ensure complete privacy then don't buy this and don't connect a NAS to your router. This device is for the user who wants a more transparent experience and doesn't have some of the privacy considerations that pro users may have about the data that they are placing on these devices. So with all that being said the WD experience has taken some time to get where it is now and it is still a little light on capability. The MyCloud Duo cloud service allows you to install Apps on the unit. There are a limited but growing selection . Some of them are subscription services which have a very limited use case associated with them. I am using this to back up photos from our phones ensuring that as soon as they connect to our local network they backup to the MyCloud. You can do this over your data service however this can result in quite a bit of traffic over mobile data. The MyCloud Duo still requires a bit of user setup and while WD isattempting to simplify the remote storage problem with a hybrid/on premise cloud storage there are otherways to achieve the same thing.Synology and QNAP NAS units have remote access functions which do not require you to sign up for the vendor hosted service portion. Ensure you understand what these device are before you purchase - Yes they are storage but they are not a true NAS device
2,I bought a 4TB My Cloud in early 2021.  I'll give it 2 stars only because it was functional and offered a reasonable cost/capacity value.However I'd recommend making a different choice - I went with a Synology NAS - because the My Cloud is so poorly thought out and difficult to work with.  Also I find the drive's read/write performance is *terrible* about 25%-30% of the speed of the internal HDD on my Dell PC.I think one of the most important considerations with using a networked drive vs. a USB-connected drive is the ease of use.  Ideally I want the NAS drive to behave like a local disk in terms of being simple to set up  always available easy to find & work with etc.  The WD My Cloud fails on all these fronts.- To set up & manage the My Cloud WD requires you to both install a utility app and to create an online account.  WD's software makes this a chore - the UI is clumsy the apps are feature-poor.- Once installed I often had cases where the drive wouldn't be visible on my network requiring restarts to fix.- On a daily basis the worst part is simply accessing the disk.  In the previous WD product the MyBook series you could easily reach the drive with a simple network path like  //mybook2tb/ .  But the My Cloud installs itself with a ridiculous unworkable path - on my machine it's similar to:  //DESKTOP-NAME/My Cloud_5as722kjhkf788623kjhhs90262623adsfx/  .  So you can never navigate to it directly you must map it to a drive letter... but that seems to be what makes it so unreliable because too often the drive mapping doesn't work.Spare yourself the frustration go with a different solution.  I've used WD products for 20+ years but after this experience I'll never buy another.
1,I bought this product from Best Buy a year ago to try to have control over all my data and documents. The idea of this is awesome. The execution of a product is terrible! First dont even try to share folders with people. It’s confusing not at all user friendly and you cannot alter or take back access. I tried to change the folder my mom had access to so it would be easy for her to navigate family photos. It ended up duplicating the access 5 times. Then when I tried to delete the duplications IT DELETED THE ACTUAL FILE. All my family pictures are gone. I called tech support and there is no trash icon no accidental restore. You can pay them or another company a bunch of money to maybe get some of your stuff back. The app that is directly connected to the wifi the my cloud is on crashed and now won’t work. So the only way to see what’s there is to login to the online website that logs you out every 20 minutes. A few months ago the WD servers went down guess what you can’t access any of your storage even though ITS SITTING IN YOUR HOUSE! For all I know it’s just adevice tapping into my wifi and the 4TB is on their servers somewhere.  Long story short THIS DEVICE IS A LIE. It is full of half promises and terrible software. Which sucks becuase it’s an amazing idea to have 4TB of personal storage you can access from an app. But if you care about your files and don’t want to waste over a $100 to have anger issues and waste hours of your time. Just use google drive for free. They take much better care of your files then these guys ever could.
3,Device lasted for about 1 year approximately then stopped working on its own. Company customer support only directed me to Drivesavers company that does the return with taking no responsibility for faulty equipment although my device was still in warranty. I forgot to double back up my stuff for about 6 months and had to pay almost 10 times this device worth to retrieve my information. Don't feel comfortable with this device along without making sure I double back up my stuff at least 1/month.In terms of hardware: device looks nice on the outside. installation wasn't complicated. But device doesn't come with it's USB drive which you need to purchase if you want to download anything in it. I think this should've been included in the device since you can't install any apps for the device without the cable.I updated my review too as I’m looking at the documents That was supposed to be uploaded long time ago but they’re not and it’s very patchy ( some of my study documents during my training has not been uploaded and I can tell because I have a backup version of them in my iCloud )Overall I wouldn't buy this device if I had these information. would suggest either My cloud mirror or one of the Synology NAS.Overall not very well experience and not dependable device
5,Easy brainless setup.  It assigns a letter drive on the parent computer.  Easy access from the internet.  No gimmicks no tricks it just freaking works.
3,I really wanted to like this but there are some dumb things that make it not nearly as good as I had hoped.First let's acknowledge that this isn't like a standard NAS -- it's got a simplified OS that's cumbersome for anyone with a degree of tech sophistication and ends up being more frustrating that useful.A big problem with that is that the speeds are garbage when you're using the built-in utilities. It's a lot faster if you just connect to the Public folder by dialing into its IP address but the OS separates the files you've put in its file structure (e.g. your Plex media) from whatever you keep in that Public folder so if you've got a lot of media content (like maybe a couple terabytes which is why you would get a multi-terabyte NAS) it's excruciating to transfer everything over. You're best off putting them on a flash drive and transferring them that way but that's not a great solution either.But worst of all is how it loses most of its functionality if you don't connect it to the outside internet (why WD thinks my home Plex server needs a connection to the outside world in order to function I'll never know). WD wants you to interact with this NAS via their own My Discovery app which is tedious (and slow).That said it does work. Three stars because it's not bad there are just too many things keeping it from being good. It's currently serving as my Plex server and it's doing an acceptable job. But as a tech-savvy person there's so much unnecessary bloat packaged with this and it obviously affects performance.
3,This is NOT a WD My Cloud network attached storage (NAS) device. Read that again! The My Cloud and My Cloud Home differ in their capabilities. I have a 12TB My Cloud NAS that I use so I know the limitations of this device.  This is not a Network Attached Storage device you have ever seen. Do not confuse it with a standard NAS device. There is a glaring issue with these devices that WD obviously designed into it for some reason. The device must be connected to the Internet to work. That may sound reasonable - but there is no way to use it locally without internet access. I understand it is a "Cloud" device. I get it. However it would have been very simple to either include an ip address interface for advanced users or show a simple option when connected locally to turn off Internet Access. You get neither option - considering these type of devices are notorious for being hacked - I think an option to turn off internet access if desired should have been included. For example - if you are using this to stream movies family photos - whatever and tomorrow a security flaw is published that means your device is at risk - your only choice would be to turn it off. I really don't understand why they do give you the option like on other devices they make and sell.This is a NAS for dummies and anyone that buys it will outgrow it ASAP.  It also is not a 4TB device you get 1.75TB due to RAID (look it up) and you will run out of space as you backup everything . . . except most of the backup software can't find this drive.Bottom line if you are even slightly technical or can read a manual buy another product.  This one is flawed in it's security and limited  in use.
1,As other reviews mention this device is not a “standard” NAS. Horribly slow operations buggy interface and painfully minimal feature set. Would never buy this again. Wish I had done more research.
1,I didnt purchase this on amazon (purchased from local best buy) but this all still applies. and this product is so bad its worth posting a review here.This device would be great in theory. but it simply doesnt work well. I have 1 Gbps ethernet speeds (verified) and even with my PC plugged in via ethernet and this device also plugged in (both 5e cables) the transfer speeds were aweful. a 50gb test folder I filled with video files photos and a few word docs transfers to my old portable 2tb drive in just a few minutes. but it took over a day to transfer the same folder. I tried various steps to help but failed. support was also unable to assist with this. also and this is partially on me for not researching first this device cannot plug directly into your PC for local file transfers. it can ONLY be transfered over the network. I found that accessing the files away from home was also a bit slow. it often failed to load thumnails for photos. I decided I would return it and get a standard 8TB hard drive (double the space for the same price since you loose the cloud "functionality". however I actually have not been able to return the device yet. because yesterday western digital's services were (and still are) down. and many devices including mine were showing offline. and since there is no USB transfer option as mentioned it means that I was unable to access my files. this issue still isnt resolved 20 hours later. http://status.mycloud.com/os4 you can see they have had multiple outages this year alone. leaving one to see that there is also service reliability issues in addition to the slow transfer speeds. also note that as a network drive (and this part isnt on WD its just information I was not aware of until I had one) there are some things you cannot do. for example. backblaze will not backup a network drive with there standard backup service. google drive will not use a network drive as a mirror device to backup your google drive. and many programs like CC cleaner will not access a network driver for functions like finding duplicate files. im still waiting for those services to be restored so I can remove my files from the device and return it.
5,I read the negative reviews on this site prior to purchasing but decided to go ahead (I did not buy from Amazon but am a genuine user and not affiliated with the company).I have now setup the device and need to correct some of the other reviews as there seems to be a lot of misinformation. Or maybe the WD software has improved recently but the following are true as of now (August 2020):- you can have multiple users each with their own private HDD space. The way it works is that you create an account on the WD home.mycloud.com site. The first account created and linked to a device is the owner account. This owner account can create other user accounts who then each get an email to verify their email address and can login to the site. Each user can add additional devices to their account if you would want to connect to multiple MyCloud Home devices.- Each user has their own space files uploaded by one user are not visible to another user even not the 'account owner'. Note that files are stored locally on your device they do not reside in the cloud. The web UI on the WD site is merely to connect into the device and show listed files/folders on the web. So the experience is like Dropbox web UI. The web UI has a viewer for different popular file formats.- Each user can share folders and files by 'inviting to collaborate' another user. If you want to share with others who have not beeen invited then you can create a link to a folder/file which gives read-only access.- Despite some other claims you can store encrypted Time Machine backups for Mac on the device. It seems the MyCloud Home device creates a server connection on the LAN in the format Time Machine needs so it can find the device and you can select it as backup location.- on Mac the files under your user account show as a volume in the Finder. You cannot see files in accounts of other users not even as an admin.- the device is a snap to setup. Because of the link with the website the device can be discovered from the web without any port forwarding hassle on your router. It also shows in the Finder as a volume still even when I am not on local LAN.Overall this seems to me a very smart implementation. 5 stars. IT folks will find a lack of configurability vs typical NAS but for others this is a good implementation. Especially for families it allows each to have their own space while providing options for sharing content.
4,Very easy to configure and get up and running. As a techie I pretty much threw away the instructions and went at it. Plug the ethernet cable into the cable modem and plug in power. There was a little bit of drama as the fans kicked on immediately on power up and they stayed on. No ethernet light on the modem either. I unplugged and plugged it back in then it worked properly.After that it was easy enough to just download the My Cloud Home (note there is a My Cloud app that isn't Home this won't work) app and create an account. I connected the device and configured it to save my iphone photos.The desktop app is similarly dummy proof. Just install the WD discovery app and select your Duo. You can then right click on any folder and set it to sync. The sync itself will run in the background either on the phone or desktop/laptop. There is also a web app you can get to via any browser. Basically this works like any normal cloud drive service. iCloud OneDrive Google Drive Dropbox etc. You can share files as well if you want.The Duo part means that there are two drives in the array set up to mirror each other. RAID 1 for the tech folks. If one drive dies you've still got all of your files.My only real issues were some cosmetic damage to the drive enclosure and the previously mentioned startup glitch. Other than that I have no problems recommending this to anyone that wants a local cloud storage service rather than having their files sitting in a data center somewhere.
3,UPDATE 5-5-2018:  The Android app doesn't work correctly.  Multiple times when I've uploaded a file it appears to upload... to somewhere at least.  Not to my drive though it never appears on the file-system.  So where did it go?  It's also geared completely around photographs.  To the point that uploading any other type of file is a serious pain and then doesn't even upload.  Arg!The moral of story is this: WD is holding the encryption keys to your drive and you will never control the keys.  You cannot access your data on your drive without sending your password to WD and they in return decrypt that specific user area on the drive.  If WD goes away or your ability to communicate with them then your data goes away.  The same as any other cloud service.  Couple this in with an app that often malfunctions then you're better off avoiding this product.  Three stars is generous.ORIGINAL REVIEW:The WD 4TB My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage Dual Drive product is a great idea with a flawed execution.  There are a lot of advantages and some major disadvantages so make sure you know what you are getting into before making a purchasing decision.The product promises to provide you with an easily deployable and reliable solution for home storage for multiple users.  Whether you are on your desktop laptop tablet or phone the My Cloud Duo is promised as the solution for the whole family.  And it does deliver on this promise - the product is easy to install easy to use and is reliable for multiple users.PRIVACY AND SECURITY:My largest concern is my privacy.  A hardware device that only I have physical control over should contain data to which only I have access.  However Western Digital shows too much interest in the digital contents on the device.  When WD should be convincing the user that safeguards are in place protecting privacy WD instead constantly is asking if they can have your permission to access it.  That's a major problem.Even to create the account and recognize your device during setup WD requires your first and last name email address and password.  The user is eventually presented with a screen asking to share your data with WD.  The screen asks if you would like to "share app activity and crash info?"  The large colorful button says "Yes do share" and a small teeny-tiny button with muted colors is hidden away below that says "No don't share".  When I selected No a new screen appeared and had the language colors and buttons reversed "Are you sure you don't want to share?" was the question and then choices of "Yes do not share" and a "No do share" button.  Obviously this is a trick to get the user to agree by making a mistake.And that's not the last time I was asked this question.  Later I was default-enrolled in a "product improvement plan" which you have to opt-out using a small hidden radio box button.  When installing the Android app it asked permissions to access my identity contacts photos and files.  Each Terms of Service is very long and tedious with multiple hyper-links that lead to brand new documents to which you are agreeing.So that's the major weakness here - privacy.  WD shows no interest in protecting it.  They deliver on the easy and reliable but support no encryption technology at all.  Only a four-digit access code protects the android app and even that isn't the default.  There is little concern for user privcy and security here.FUNCTIONALITY:Moving photographs and mpegs from a cell phone to cloud storage is a common task.  And the mobile software makes this very easy.  Either from context menus within the operating system or by using the WD software itself backups and moving files are easy.  All this works very well and I am impressed.  An auto-backup option is available so that all photographs are backed-up without any additional effort.  And unlike other cloud storage solutions you control the physical hardware.Moving files between two Windows 10 PCs was simple.  I simply dragged and dropped a multi-gigabyte folder of MP3s onto the network mount (that the software created for me).  I saw about 4.5 MB/s speeds.Adding new users and keeping files separated is also easy but raises another privacy eyebrow.  From the My Cloud web portal your enter the users email and WD sends an invite request.  That user will then create a MyCloud account and will be assigned space on your physical device.  Keep in mind that software controlled by WD is doing this not software you control.  You control physical access WD controls software access.  Once a new account is setup sharing files in the common Family folder sending web links to non-users and moving files is easy and reliable.CONCLUSION:As far as the easy and reliable promise WD delivers.  The software and the hardware work really well together and the MyCloud 4TB drive offers an attractive alternative to other cloud based solutions such as Dropbox OneDrive etc.  But the huge advantage of personal privacy is a lost opportunity and WD shows a strong bias on getting its hands on your data.  That's too bad a 5-star product and experience sours into something less.
3,This is definitely one of the more interesting items that I have reviewed lately in that it has gotten a LOT of negative feedback from other reviewers despite doing exactly what it is advertised to do. Most of the bad reviews you will see here are fromcustomers who bought the item thinking that they were buying a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. There is NOTHING in the description suggesting that this device acts as a NAS or has any of the features commonly associated with a NAS (SMB SSH internal web server USB connectivity etc.). My question to these reviewers is why would you spend hundreds of dollars on a product without fully reading the description of what it does and does not do? It doesn't blend vegetables either. Are you going to blame Western Digital for that as well?To be sure this product is NOT a NAS and NOT an external drive. It isn't even a hybrid of the two. This is a very dumbed-down device that is aimed at those who would not be shopping for a NAS to begin with due to the complexity of dealing with things like SMB and local networking. It is aimed at those who are NOT tech-savvy and wouldn't know how to use advanced features.Keeping that in mind the product is simple to set up simple to use and provides a very simple feature set with very limited opportunity to mess things up. It is really best used as a "set it and forget it" device for backing up various devices that are not always at the same location sharing the same LAN. You can back up your laptop in the living room while also backing up your entire family's Android devices while they are on opposite ends of the planet and none of them need to know anything more about computers or networking than how to use an app on their smartphone.If you want a NAS or external storage device to use on your LAN then buy one! If you want a simple way to back-up all of your devices from multiple locations and don't want to hassle with a bunch of features you don't want and will never use then give this product a try. So far it has met all of my expectations right out of the box.
4,This product is limited as a NAS if you are looking for a full featured NAS this isn’t for youBad pointsSlow at timesNo real local admin options  no real permission managementCan’t configure as SMB shareGood pointsGreat for pics and home VideoDecent Plex server for Apple TV Fire TvSimple setupduo version is a cheap Raid setupAdvancedThis is what I am most excited aboutDeveloper api and Doc!!!!!!
3,I have owned a number of a WDC NAS products to my satisfaction. However "Home Personal Cloud" does not support traditional local network configuration.  You must create a WDC account and do an external connection to their cloud. All drive functions are on an app in your WDC account. If you disconnect the internet your PC to NAS connection will be lost. I did manage to find a work around by direct IP address but my backup app did not support. Also not sure about network security with this configuration.-- If you need a no-brainer shared drive on your home network this will be fine for you. However if you rather keep your networking local and have traditional network configuration capabilities this unit is not for you.
4,There are a lot of things I like about the WD My Cloud and some things that I don't like. The My Cloud is a connected hard drive a sort of personal DropBox. At 2TB this can store a lot of personal files for you and your family.Setting up the My Cloud CAN be difficult. Essentially it requires you to log into a website answer a few questions and download a piece of software. I however had some problems with the Windows 10 version of the software it wouldn't connect to the drive with the only work around was to turn off the secure boot. Hopefully in the future this will be fixed with a newer version. On Mac I did not experience any problems at all setting it up.Once set up a link to the drive appears in  your file browser and you can use it like any drive. When navigating the drive you can create share links for friends.One of my biggest gripes is that as far as I can tell there is no way to attach to it offline. It requires the use of the WD Discovery application. For that I don't think this is a good NAS device requiring you to use it simply for cloud storage. Makes me wonder if it will even work if there is no internet access present.Western Digital has provided access to some applications that you can configure on the My Cloud; such as Plex. Which is great you can stream movies on the My Cloud using Plex. I have had no problems playing back movies and Transcoding at least 1 stream. I wouldn't push this or use it as a dedicated Plex media server though.Overall it is a good piece of kit and is quite speedy.
4,[PLEASE READ] .This product might cause a little confusion.  Please please PLEASE read all about it BEFORE YOU PURCHASE IT.  It visibly resembles an external hard drive but that's not really what it is.  It's not a Time Machine backup nor is it an NAS.  Basically it's a self-contained FTP server.I had to read the description a few times before I really understood what it was.  I'll describe what I use it for:  I do freelance work from time to time.  This often means I have to transfer large files in-between locations.  Now instead of uploading to my FTP space I can just copy the file to this device on my network then send a web-link to my client.  I can also get files to my computer network at home by uploading straight to it.It even allows you to create users so they have their own space.  For example I gave my wife space on it so she could automatically upload photos from the camera on her phone to it.  I have 3 TB of storage plenty of room!I really do like this device but I do ache for a software update that lets me create an 'administrator' account that lets me see ALL the files on it.  Right now they're only visible per-user... eh maybe that's for the better I just don't know what i'll do if I run out of space and need to audit this device to make room.
1,Just a warning that this will not connect to your Sonos as a library like the old mycloud did. This has an app you can play songs from but it cannot be searched or indexed using the Sonos library. Bought mine directly from WD but thought all should know here too.
4,I'm a little disappointed with this product.  First although the box was in flawless condition mine came with a crack on the case.  It's not enough to impact use but it's weird.  The case itself feels cheap so I am not all that shocked.  Speaking of the case there is a light bright white light on it.  I don't know why companies insist on putting bright lights on products that are always on.  Another thing that bothers me about this product is that the fan is audible.  My router is in my bedroom and moving its location would require me to have another ethernet port installed somewhere else in my house so I have to keep the router in the bedroom.  The router has a fan but it's not audible.  Why is the fan for this product audible?  I have to turn this item off at night.  At least there's a power button in the back to shut it off gracefully at night.I think the best part of this product is that it is simple to set up.  You don't need any knowledge of computers to get everything up and running.  It took me about 10 minutes to get up and running on both my phone and my desktop.  I can access my files from my phone whenever I want which I find helpful.  This product is easier to set up than a true NAS but has limitations such as no offline access.Overall I like this product despite some of its flaws and recommend it to anyone who just wants a way to back up their computer files and phone files easily.
5,What is this item?A 4TB Hard Drive connected by a LAN cable directly to your home router/modem.  Two cords:  The LAN and a Power Cord.  You then download the app sign up for a username and password and can save content such as documents photos videos from your mobile device computer etc directly to this hard drive remotely as it is your own personal Cloud Storage.Set-up and unpacking was maybe 8 minutes?  Super fast and easy.  I have an iPhone and downloaded the app. There is an automatically generated folder in your account entitled Family.  This is a folder than anyone you want to share it with can upload photos to which is a cool idea.  You can also invite others to share your storage with you a la your wife or kids.Immediately I set up a folder for the current month of June and checked off all the photos and videos from my phone I wanted to save in the Cloud.  I was home so the network was fast and voila!  I saved 168 photos and videos in a few minutes.  They can be found in the folder moved renamed or saved.  You can also open the photo in another app such as for editing.  Also and best you can share that photo so you could email or Text it to someone from the cloud!  Of course you can also delete.  Photos can be sorted by name date or size.  Important to note that date is just upload date not the actual date the photo was taken.  That data is not apparent anywhere within the app.  For the folders themselves they can be Shared renamed or moved in to another folder.  All the functions most people would want.Also under photos (this is all in the iOS app) you can see all the photos by month or check off to just see videos only which is cool.  The videos should play well and did for me at home straight off of the cloud.Also I went to the desktop version and it works smooth as well.  Again very similar although perhaps not quite as streamlined.The only bad thing I have to say is that I downloaded the iPad version of the app and tried to sign in but it would not let me and said I had the wrong username and password.  Not sure what this was about as it was the same one used for the desktop and app.  I need to figure that out as I will want to access the cloud from my iPad.Device is not too big but also is handsome looking for what it is worth.  Like all Western Digital Products it appears to be really well made.I highly recommend this really for anyone in the modern world.  I can have my mom look at photos and not have to email/text them to her any more.  She can just access the cloud!
1,I pride myself on balanced fact based assessments.  In the case of the My Cloud Duo Home Device I have had the 8TB Model for over 2 years now in RAID 1 configuration.  The device has done its job allowing access to files on multiple computers in my home network as well as allowing me to access files over the internet from work when I need a reference.3/1/21 - In a "Spring Cleaning" of my computers at home I have had issues with the WD Discovery APP on my Mac AND Windows PCs.  Specifically I would install the software and sign into my device. everything would look fine however on Mac it will close My Discovery when I click on My Cloud Duo.  In Windows it will open in Explorer but will freeze when I try to add a file or folder.  I then RESET the devise with button on the back of it....l since then I a met with a 4 hour (and counting) message of UPDATE IN PROGRESS... WE'VE MADE SOME BIG IMPROVEMETS TO MY CLOUD HOME. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS YOUR DEVICE IS:- COMPLETELY REBUILDING AND IMPROVING HOUSE YOUR CONENT IS STORED.- PERFORMING A SERIES OF REBOOTS. PLEASE DO NOT UNPLUG YOUR DEVICE FROM POWER.- THIS MAY TAKE A WHILE. YOUR CONTENT IS KEPT SAFE AND SOUND DURING THIS PROCESS.I understand that hardware periodically releases upgrades however1) There was not email (I checked) not a prompt to give me the option to accept this firmware upgrade or not2) there is no communication of how long this firmware upgrade will take3) there is no communication of the improved functionality or bug fixes that this upgrade is addressing.the inability to access files from a networked storage device is crippling to my productivity and there was no notice of what is in this update the optionality of installing it or not nor an anticipated duration for completion.Very Poor I.T. Support Rollout for this that leaves an otherwise decent device with a bad taste in my mouth.
2,This is a very strange device. For reasons beyond my comprehension WD made this device such that it is purely a Cloud device. If you want to store something on it you have to access it over the Cloud which makes it very limiting. My hope was to use it as a storage device for my entire home network and be able to access documents from anywhere. There is no apparent way to do that.When you install it on your (in my case largely Windows) network it shows up as a device in Networks as "MYCLOUD-xxxxxx" with a single share under it ("Public"). Seemed useful so I mapped a drive to that share and copied a few files over.I then logged into the web interface which is *not* on the device itself. You have to log into a Western Digital site create an account and go through their interface. There is no local interface to the device--that is just weird. If you try to directly navigate to the device in a browser you get a useless error message.Still after creating a login and identifying my drive I could see the contents of my Cloud drive which consisted of well nothing... My files were not there. I then added a file through the web interface and checked back on my network share--also nothing. Apparently there is some sort of partitioning going on behind the scenes that prevents you from seeing files from the web that you added locally and vice versa so that along makes this drive pretty worthless.Moved on to the next step which was to install WD's software on one of my computers. My hope was that this might let me do some sort of advanced configuration to allow the device to behave more logically but it did not. It did automatically map a drive for me and I could then see the files that I had uploaded via the the web interface so that was an improvement but I would have to add the software to every machine on my network which I don't really want to do.Additionally it did its automapping to drive Z: which was already in use for and external USB drive so it essentially threw that device under the bus.In short I'm very disappointed in this device. It *should* be a true NAS device that also has a Cloud interface but instead it really does not do anything truly well.
4,Everything now is in the cloud... and you have several options. You could use Amazon or Google or OneDrive or iCloud or Dropbox.... OR you could just have your own little cloud. And there's a lot to be said for that! Cloud services are not cheap and often have proprietary limits (try using icloud with your android device). The expense is also never-ending usually requiring a monthly fee for each user.With all these choices the WD "My Cloud" personal cloud storage device is a viable alternative. Of course the amount of storage you can get is always a premium. I was able to test out the 2TB version which (due to the RAID1 configuration) is really only 1TB of storage. But my OneDrive account is only 100Gb so it's not that crazy.Initial setup and configuration was fairly easy -- unpackage plug the device into your router wait for the white light to stay on download the app and you're off to the races. You can even use an Alexa skill to connect to the device (note - I have not tested this feature - only noting the potential). Really it could not be any more simple. The device itself is very attractive and "smart" looking. The app is "usable" but could also use some improvements. Hopefully WD will continue to refine it over time. You can also manage the device via the WD Discovery application. This application allows you to manage settings update firmware etc.NOTICE: THIS IS NOT A NAS DEVICE!!You'll see this mentioned frequently here. For those who aren't aware NAS stands for "Network Attached Storage". The NICE thing about NAS is that you can connect it to your network and access it from several computers -- even map a drive to it. In some ways this is how OneDrive works and why it's a favorite cloud option for me. It seamlessly integrates with Windows and has a very slick mobile app. And while it's cloud storage it doubles as a local drive from pretty much any computer or device which allows your files to 'follow' you. THIS DEVICE WILL NOT DO THAT. I really keep finding myself wanting to 'browse out' to the drive from an explorer interface which you cannot do. You CAN access it from a browser but that's not quite the same. Unfortunately due to this factor copying large files (such as videos or backups) over the network or via USB can sometimes feel very slow. This is CLOUD STORAGE and only intended to be used as such. It does not promise or purport to be anything else.This device does say it works with Microsoft backup but honestly I would not try it. I DO NOT see this as a 'backup drive' although you may want to use it as such to "back things up' to the cloud the truth is the device is likely at home. Thus it's not really backing your data up anywhere that it's not already located. Now if you have a dear friend or relative who will let you plug this up at their house you start to open some interesting doors to how this can be a benefit. This drive MUST be powered on at all times and connected to the Internet to function. Others have noted the security risk around this and I do not disagree. Too often security flaws are discovered and left un-patched for long periods of time (or forever) and you face a certain risk because this device will not be kept up or managed by WD or anyone else. For that matter I have removed one star. I would discourage anyone from putting personal/confidential information on this drive.Also worth noting -- while this drive includes a Plex server for music good luck trying to figure it out and set it up. The average user likely cannot. Otherwise music is just files. If you have dreams of setting up the Alexa skill and streaming music from this drive you've got big dreams.Where this drive really stands out and excels if you ask me is in photo sharing and backup. You can create a shared repository upload your photos to that location then remove them from your phone. From that aspect it replaces iCloud for backups (again a monthly cost) and allows you to put your photos out there where they can be accessed and viewed by your entire family. It saves room on your phone and creates a nice shared repository. The "down" side to this is that everyone needs to set up an account and who doesn't have enough of those? This is because each individual using the "My Cloud Home" product has their own personal storage space on the My Cloud. This is cool because you get personal storage. But the admin cannot see the storage of other users (such as minor children) which is not good. However each user can share their personal data with others by invitation.Overall I like this device and it has a lot of potential. I really do wish I had a bigger drive as photos and videos will quickly fill up the 1TB of storage over time. I also feel like it will take time to figure out how this device "fits" into my other available network and cloud options (backup drive NAS drive cloud services etc.). My recommendation is to read up on this drive before just purchasing to see if it will do EXACTLY what you want it to do and (if it will) then buy it specifically for that purpose. Do NOT buy it for a purpose for which it was not designed or you'll be disappointed.
1,Given my frustration with this product I wish Amazon had a 0 star rating possible for a product or a -ve rating if possible.  Just to clarify I own several WD "My Cloud" devices (6 of them actually) and then this 1 "My Cloud Home".  As far as I could tell WD is not selling the old "My Cloud" devices any more - which I LOVE.  Have owned them for years and they work wonderfully.1. I buy a 8TB drive and only 7TB is available for use - that is a whole 1TB lost for god knows what.2. The only way to access the drive is through WD Discovery - you cannot just mount it like any other cloud storage3. Performance is TERRRRRRRRRRRRRIBLE.  The same tasks that take 10-20 seconds on a "My Cloud" can take up 10-20 minutes on the "My Cloud Home" - not a typo.4. I ran into a problem within 8 months of buying this device where it said that it was full but even if I deleted files from it the drive would not recognize the freed up space.  I read on-line that it may take a week for this to happen - so I waited.  No use.  Finally tech support sent me a replacement drive.  I had to transfer all 8TB over to the new drive - now it has been about 2 weeks.  And suddenly voila the old drive recognizes the free space (I had not deleted any additional files on it just copied them to the new device).5. There are no levers ways to actually tune performance - since all you have access to is WD Discovery.6. Each time WD Discovery does an update the drive is unusable for a long time.  And the messages are ambiguous.  It tells you that the update has completed but it is apparently doing something else which prevents drive access.  What you see is a message that says that it is unable to connect to mycloud home since the internet is not accessible although it is.7. Which brings you to the worst part of the drive - you cannot use it without internet access.  Although it is called "My Cloud HOME" you apparently cannot just use it inside the home without access to mycloud home on wd.comI have posted on the WD forums lots of others have posted on the forums.  But nothing is different.Since WD does not offer the WD Cloud any more now I have to find a different vendor to buy from if I need additional cloud storage.
2,I am not really sure what WD was going for with this product. It almost seems like one of those products that has been so simplified that it became complicated. I have used a number of NAS storage devices over the years many with all sorts of "cloud" features that could be ignored if desired. This one is different-there is no way to manage this device as a simple NAS device You are in for the whole "online cloud" experience.=== The Good Stuff ===* If what you want is a large block of storage accessible to multiple users via the internet this is your drive. It was relatively easy to configure the product to do just that and to give individual users their own blocks of storage with limits and permissions.* The iOS interface worked very well and I was able to view my directories from my iPhone 7 with no problems or drama.* I could store and retrieve files from the drive with no problems although it was certainly slower (maybe 15-20%?) that my standard NAS drives.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* The purpose of the product escapes me. It seemed like I was using my own hardware and time to set up the equivalent of Dropbox. I guess if you need a very large amount of shared space with remote users this might be the perfect product.* There is no way to operate this product without going through the network software. Try as I might I couldn't find its local IP address and you can not configure it as a local NAS drive. At least I couildn't.* I am not enough of a networking expert to evaluate the security features of the always-connected protocol but as I began to understand how the product worked those little hairs on the back of my neck were starting to go up. It also seemed that there were open ports always available although not my area of expertise.=== Summary ===Not what I was hoping for. What I wanted was a large NAS device with the ability to share portions of it with other remote users as required. What I got was a large block of storage that might as well be Dropbox just that I get to handle all the admin and security issues. It was disappointing
5,I have utilized this product for both personal use and for me and wife’s businesses. Works great and stops from having to store everything on devices.
4,I was originally interested in this drive as an easy was to keep access to some files when away from home but I also run some things on my network that I'd like to be able to have access to the storage as well. Unfortunately it seems that Western Digital has limited some of that crossover. To use the cloud features you are required to use an always on application on your computer to access the data. After a little trouble getting the latest version of the app(older one couldn't find the drive) I found everything to work as expected. I can access the files and use them as I would any other network device and the android app allows my phone to see them too. Just make sure the app stays running or the drive will disappear from windows. If you want anything else(android apps linux servers)to be able to see the same files you're out of luck. There is a "Public" share that can be accessed but it is just that. An unsecure-able separate share that anyone(no authentication) on the network can add files to but that has no cloud functionality and no way to transfer directly to that other partition. That complaint aside this isn't marketed as a NAS; it's a Personal Cloud. If that's what you're looking for that this will fit your needs nicely. Setup was cake. A power cord and a network connection was all that was needed. I still find this useful but I'd like a little more freedom in the settings for adapting to how I want to use it than a prescribed our-way-or-the-highway method.
3,I sometimes struggle with this device but overall it does what it’s advertised to do.
3,The "WD Cloud Home" drive appears to be a very locked-down product. It is NOT the same thing as "WD Cloud". It is very easy to use for basic home cloud storage and the WD Discovery application may even support backing up your computer to this drive.I purchased this product to serve as the cloud drive for my Acronis Backup software which I have been using very successfully for 10+ years. I have an existing WD Cloud drive that works awesome for this purpose but after two days of reading about other people's failures to get the WD Cloud Home drive to work with Acronis I am giving up and sending it back.
3,So I've used this thing for maybe 6-8 months now (I had it for a while and didn't set it up).I did NOT use the tech support and hardly used the website at all save to download the software.Install process was fairly simple (and uninstall was easy as well)Tons of storage space fairly fast but not lightning fast though I feel like that depends on your computer and your internet speed.The only issue is it HAS to be connected to the internet. That means if you lose internet or you lose electricity or you're moving or you don't have access to an ethernet port you can't get to your stuff even with a direct USB from device to laptop. That is really inconvenient if you happen to have important stuff on there. Plus if it crashes you lose everything. I'm not sure why they can't have it function without internet if it's plugged directly in but I guess the tech is beyond me.Other than that it's excellent. It even allows you to send share links to people similar to Google Drive.final thoughts: useful for certain thinks but I'd keep your important stuff off of it.
4,It’s a good place to save memories but you have to redownload the app for it to run properly.
2,I purchased this device on sale from Newegg. It works as intended and I have been able to use the app to access files. That being said the app for this device is quite lacking. It has a horrible video viewer and it can be quite sluggish. I wish at the very least that there were an option to use the iOS built in video player as it works much better than what WD has put in their app.Overall this product functions decently. And it does work well for my time machine backups. It has served the purposes I intended it for for the most part with one MAJOR exception which is why I am writing this review.I contacted WD through a few methods and received no response. I was trying to determine if they have any plans to add 2 Factor Authentication to this device. You would think that something that holds potentially sensitive customer data would have 2 Factor Authentication without a doubt. NOPE! All someone would need is my password and they could get right into this device. This is very concerning to me and disturbs me that a company so well established could not even be bothered to offer such a critical feature. This device has been out for a long time now and still is missing such an important feature!I continue to assess whether I will continue using this device and for anyone considering using it I say BUYER BEWARE. If WD cannot do something as minor as adding two factor authentication what does that say about their dedication to keeping customer data secure? This really makes me question what other security holes WD left behind because no one would notice.Until 2 Factor Authentication is added and WD makes some statement to assure us that the security of these devices is a top priority I will not be recommending this device to anyone. I would give it at least 3 stars maybe 4 if this was addressed. I hope WD will read my feedback and add 2 Factor Authentication as a result!
1,This is a terrible suite of tools - NAS hardware WD Discovery WD Drive Utilities.  It won't let you use it any way you want in terms of a network storage device without going through all their software and WD account.  It's not really a NAS.  If you want reliable storage just by a QNAP 2 bay NAS (and you will get RAID1 redundancy that you don't get with this device) and you can use it any way you want.  It's worth the learning curve.  Hate this product.
3,We didn't know we needed 12 TB of disc storage space but it seems that the more room for storage we get the more we need.  Western Digital is the best you can buy and we trusted the name.  This product was very simple to begin using.  It is pretty big so it's not portable but I love the idea of the mirror image backup feature.  However this product is not ready for prime time.  It installs a bunch of stuff on your computer.  It's difficult to access data that you think you have stored.  Nothing is private as anyone can log into it somehow and see everything you've got.  It is not yet worked out so that it behaves in the way you expect it.  I am not analytical and I am not a techie.  I didn't know what I was doing wrong and so I looked at other reviews of this machine.  It is not a simple network attached storage.  It doesn't come with documentation specifically for this model.  You're on your own and you have to observe what it does.  I have always relied on Western Digital storage and I'm sad to say that this product seems half-baked.  I do hope they improve it.
1,On their first attempt at this device they did a great job.  It was 6 TBs fast easy to use and just all around great.  It was so great in fact that they stopped supporting it after a year.  Since it was still working too well they released firmware that made the device completely unusable.  When you try to communicate with customer service you get an amazing run around that leads you absolutely nowhere.  When you go to their support page they tell you do basic troubleshooting then to call the customer support number.  Let me save those of you who have tried and are still trying some time and tell you that there is no fix and since it is no longer supported there never will be.  Don't take it to Geek Squad or take the entire A+ hardware computing course and pass it to figure out what to do like I did.  If you do not believe me read the reviews on this device as well as any other WD device to get your proof.  There is a reason why this is one of the cheapest drive you found. It doesn't seem like that big of a deal until you lose TBs of information that is unrecoverable not because of something that you did wrong but because WD believes it is time for you buy a new drive.  That is 6 TB of lost pictures videos documents etc that you WILL NEVER get back and they will never answer for.  When they decide that a they want to get they will just break your drive squelch on your warranty and never answer you directly or indirectly. Save yourself both time and money and stay away from WD as this is a cautionary tale.
3,I wanted to really like this device more then I do. Don't get me wrong it built nice and stores pics easily.  The interface is OK but not great some content will store directly to the device and some will not. The flexibility just isnt there.The device looks nice and is not very loud to me. Sometimes with drives like this you can hear them spin up when information is being demanded or written.Since this device is in RAID 1 it creates a duplicate of the content in case you lose a drive.You must know this is NOT A NAS and you must connect to the internet to use this deice. For the money you could buy a 2 bay Nas and 2 hard drives like a Synology 218 Net Gear 212 or Qnap231p or so many other choices and 2 hard drives. You would have so much more flexibility
1,I purchased a 2TB WD home and transferred all of my files pictures and important information to the WD home.  I failed to back it up and in 1 year the HD failed losing all of my data.  I took it to a local PC repair company and they had to send it to a lab for downloading.  Cost was $1600. and all I received were 5 useless pictures.  I now switched to a new access point with a USB port for external memory and inserted a 2 tb hard drive and now have access to all my data at any time on any pc.  BTW I recovered most of my lost data by going through other cloud sources emails and old flash drives.  Never again.....
1,I have a Mycould OS2. It was able to get to work nicely along with Acronis backup. Had to replace it with the new OS3 due to security. I have been working professionally and personally with computers since the old mainframes. No idea how many languages I have learned and used. I was happy with the old mycloud. But this one sets a whole new level of rotten user interface and user guides. Totally unfathomable and unresponsive.
5,Simple install. Liking the interface so far.
3,I would love to say I am very happy with these Cloud Drives but the software is too dumbed down to allow me to set things up the way I want and there's no other option to control this system. The other downside is that there's no way to connect a computer directly to the drive so with my relatively slow internet uploading 4k movies takes a ridiculously long time.I still believe that Western Digital makes some of the most reliable inexpensive hard drives in the business and I love the My Cloud wired system I'm currently using I just thought this new setup would be an upgrade and easier to use but in actuality the older wired system is still my go-to for large files.
4,Set up was simple just as advertised.  I just plugged it into my home router and it was immediately available on my network.  It doesn't act as a standard shared drive though which was what I expected.  Instead you have to download a special app for each computer that you want to have access the drive.  I got it set up on my windows computer OS/X computer and iOS devices.  Once the app is installed you can move files around using standard file system tools but the app has to be installed.  I couldn't get it to work with Linux though - I found some third-party instructions online that described how some other people had done it but I couldn't get it to work (it doesn't appear to be officially supported).  In fact my biggest concern with this device is how little documentation I could find on how it actually works.  When I use it from my iphone there's an iphone app called "my cloud" that I can use to browse the files on the device - even when I'm not connected to my local network.  That means that this thing is poking a hole in my internal network's firewall and exposing a server to the outside internet and I can't find any information on just how secure this all is.
1,This device is dumbed down so much that the Plug-N-Play concept is infuriating. Don't fool yourself thinking is a NAS device it is not. Management is crippled access is web based or forced mapped drive and its irritatingly slow. You can't even access the device using standard UNC \\ServerPath directory structure. You can't block internet access with the device which means the only security is user name and password on the WD cloud site. Stay away. I spent a day with it and I am beyond disappointed. It's heading back for a refund.
1,This is not easy to set up and if you think you will get anything helpful from WD you are in for a surprise.  This team can't even get their own site working never mind helping you to get yours working.I could not get mine working correctly.  I got messages that there was no account and then that I could not create an account as one existed. The solution from WD was to remove my ID and thus wiping the entire drive so I could start all over again.  Luckily it happened early on so there was nothing there that I could not reproduce.  This "solution" took over 10 emails.  I was directed to do a page to create a debug log.  The page was terribly confusing as there were multiple options and no direction from WD on which one to use.  I was directed to email it.  the file was 500MB so obviously won't email.  I was then told by the page to put it in a directory which didn't work and finally was told to load it on google.  After all this the answer was 'I dunno' and we can delete your ID and you can redo all your work rather than us figuring out what is wrong with our system.This is not the first (but will be the last) support interaction with WD. The first one was getting multiple requests for the same information until you gave. up on a badly designed item that was still under warranty.This is the terrible company with mediocre products.
3,THis device is not really my cup of tea. It does provide ample storage and for the average user looking to have someone where to back up photos from the their phone tablet or even the PC.  Setup is pretty easy but this is very much an IOT device.  Even though this device will be plugged into your router you will not have direct access to it.  So again if you are not interested in the this sort of tech but want someplace to just back up your device data  Get this follow the directions out of the box and you will have redundant storage.HOwever if your and IT professional like me... The idea of a device on my network that I don't have root access too is maddening.  There is not reason this box couldn't double as a NAS.  It would allow for much more granular security and you wouldn't have to rely on Western Digital for it.
4,I purchased a 4TB MyCloud Home and it set up easily at first.  You can see it as a TimeMachine backup drive immediately after installing the software.  But you cannot mount the drive for access as a network drive.  This means that you will only be able to access your files through the web interface.  I finally found a support document that acknowledged that the software doesn't work correctly on M1 Macs and that they will release a fix in the future--however long that will be.
2,Pros: Unit does work and can stream over the network to your smart tv or wifi hot location.  Great for large files.Cons: Hard to break the mirror when there is an issue. Even if one drive fails it puts a burden on the rest of the unit and will slow down transfer rates by 90%. This will take weeks to get all your data off if lucky.Hard disks run all the time and never go to sleep mode. This will give you about 3 -5 years and then a drive will fail.  The only options are to sink more money into the unit try and hope to repair it or purchase another unit.Suggest just paying for a PaaS or IaaS cloud service OR just have your removable hard drive on the router.Unit works good it will gain your trust then fail. Even if you have a backup I did you have to move to a new location and  or come up with a new solution and toss the unit in the trash. I could purchase two more hard disks for it ....with discount code from WD. Still putting more money in an out of warranty unit.  Remember the 3 to 5 years.  Last resort you can send to one of WD contractors to pull your data off and some unreal price. Good Luck from the movie Taken !!
2,This is a very peculiar network attached storage device. I'm not sure it should really be called a NAS. If you're just using it for file storage and don't care at all about media (video/photo/music) sharing it's probably a good cheap option. You will however have to put all of your files in public folder and therefore be unable to assign Windows access controls -- everyone on your network will see them.If you are interested in this as media server you may want to look elsewhere. You are forced to use the Plex media server which has many limitations. You must use exactly the folders it sets up -- no options to create your own set of folder names. You can put whatever you want inside their folders but at the top level it's the MyMusic MyPhotos etc. that they provide and nothing else. I only tried Plex for my 1.3TB music collection and it was unusable. It munged all the metadata (which showed up fine in JRiver Roon and several other applications). It takes forever to index as well.Another quirk of this device is that your best bet to copy files to it is through the web client similar to loading files into Dropbox or iCloud. If you try and copy files in Windows Explorer it takes forever. Loading up even 100GB is impractically slow.There's an online forum for tech support. The answer to your questions are 1)No or 2)I don't know.I would not buy this device again.
1,NOTE: Full disclosure. I bought my drive directly from the WD website not Amazon. And I use a 2019 Mac mini.The concept is great but this system has proven to be a tremendous time suck. All I'm doing is trying to back up materials from an external WD drive to my Home Duo with drag and drop. It is such a slow and painful process. I've had endless problems with the WD Discovery software. Often the drive shows up blank and in order to see the contents of the drive I have to restart my computer. Sometimes I have to power down the drive and start it up. Copying onto the drive takes AGES. It is so damn slow. And it never completes a copy. It craps out somewhere along the line and I have to check each file to make sure everything's been backed up. Seriously the basic concept is to copy things onto this drive and it is an almost impossible task so save your money and invest in an offsite back up service a back up software or some other drive besides the Home Duo.OK. That said if you can get your materials onto this box turd then access via the phone app and via the .com is excellent. And sharing files works well too. So there are some pluses if you can manage to get things onto the drive.
3,Let me admit that I'm not very tech savy but I'm not a slacker either and wasn't sure how to rate this My Cloud Home Storage.  It works as a basic PERSONAL storage cloud most of the time.  I've been using it for months before posting this review and I'm not sure I'd recommend it.  It was easy enough to set up initially but getting certain features (outside access) took some work and older relatives didn't like the steps involved or the lack of digital interaction (we could not see anything they posted in their file).  Also I had issues with My Cloud Home dropping connection when using a laptop.  It plugs directing into your router so wifi is key and the only way it works.  There is a free app to manage it.  Overall 2TB is on the lower end offered and its spotty access makes this a storm cloud for my purposes.
1,BACKGROUND:  I've been in need of a NAS for sometime.  I shoot sports photography and have several TBs of photos from over the years.  I'm now moving into drone videos and photos so my storage needs are increasing.  Several of my friends use the Synology NAS with no issues and have nothing but great experiences.  After being able to test this 12TB drive from WD I'm headed over to Synology.THE ISSUE:  It's not that this drive doesn't have enough space to store your files...12TB is a ton of space.  However WD has set this drive up where you can not locally access ANY files on this NAS without going to the internet and then pulling down your files over the internet (even though the device is sitting on your local network!)  This is crazy and creates unnecessary use of internet data on your ISP's network.  The unit even has two USB ports on the device can you access files or push anything to the USB drives you plug in....NO.  The ports are setup to suck in files to the NAS but can not write anything from the NAS to the USB.WHAT ABOUT MULTIPLE USERS:  While you can setup multiple users the become stand alone partitions and one can't oversee another (I.e. i'm a parent and want to have access to my child's folders).  Want to put private files onto the NAS...when you plug the USB drive in to store the files they go into a public area on the NAS which every user can see until you file them.  Unreal.WELL WHAT ABOUT THE ADVERTISED PLEX FEATURE?:  This box while it can be configured to provide Plex services it's ability to rapidly feed media via the internal Plex server is terrible.  It's a watered down version of Plex and combined with the slow serve times it becomes pretty useless.WELL THEN WHO IS THIS FOR?  Probably not many people who know anything about a NAS and want any time of control over their data or want the ability to store data locally without having to expose your entire NAS to the internet.  I'd say this is for the very basic user who simply just wants to plug a box in and be able to access files on the go without needing or worrying about security or the ability to manage permissions/users.I'm buying a   Synology DS418play NAS Disk Station 4-bay 2GB DDR3L (Diskless)         today and will enjoy having a professional NAS with great software interface and the ability to keep my data from being exposed to the internet in order to access it.
1,Update 9-22-20: After I had been using this system for about a year I started noticing that a file would occasionally disappear from my computer. It was almost always a file that I used and updated regularly and had just revised. The file would just disappear into cyberspace and it wasn't in the MyCloud backup either. My IT guy couldn't figure it out. Then I went looking for a newly vanished file in its source folder and I saw a file with the same title with "sync error" indicated. I was able to recover it thankfully. This led me to suspect this device was eating files when syncing so I disabled it. I haven't lost a file since then.******Original review: I’m a believer in backing up my files but I have never been able to bring myself to trust a cloud before. I’ve always been concerned that they’re too easily hacked. I decided to give this MyCloud system a try thinking it was less likely to be “invaded” than the more common platforms like Apple and Google. So this is my first cloud experience and so far so good... for the most partSetup was pretty simple although they provide minimal instruction which is becoming the norm. You plug in the box to your WiFi router you download apps to your phone and computer and it’s pretty straightforward from there. On your computer you right-click on files that you want to be synced. One thing I was trying to figure out was how to schedule regular backups for files on the computer; however it appears that backup is automatic. As soon as you modify or add a file it’s there in the cloud folder. If you manually sync it takes very little time so it doesn’t interfere with whatever else you need to do on your computer. (WD has confirmed this to be the case.)On my iPhone the MyCloud app requires that I enter my security PIN every time even when the app is already open in the background. That’s extra protection and I’m happy about that. I can see the backed-up file folders in the app. I can open photos just by clicking on them. Other files require that I select the application with which to open them. The default application is shown including Adobe PDF Word and Excel. PDFs open fine but so far I’m unable to open Word or Excel files. I *am* able to copy the file into an email so I can email it to myself on my phone and open it from there. Very weird but it may be an idiosyncrasy with Apple. I don’t know if it’s possible to sync files that are on my iPhone although that’s not currently a concern. I backup my iPhone to iTunes regularly.For the most part it seems to be working very well. I’ve had this system in place for a few days and I’m definitely less stressed knowing I won’t lose everything if my computer crashes.***June 28 2018 update: I can't believe how often I am using the cloud to send files to my work computer. I can use my email app on my iPhone to share a link to the cloud file - I email it to my work address so I can access the file on the other computer. I do this a few times a week and it's amazingly convenient and easy. So happy to have this system!
2,Having come from WD's previous My Cloud line the new Home systems are quite similar though in a slightly sleeker case design. Still utilizing WD 'efficient' disks the My Cloud Home Duo ships in a redundant (mirrored) setup that gives you 2TB usable space (of the 4TB total). The setup is extremely easy and straightforward - both with app or via your computer (web-interface) and the cloud access (both inside and outside your network) is flawless.There is much less configurability than with the older My Cloud devices but that's probably fine for most folks. TimeMachine Backups for Macs work out of the box. BUT - that would be my one complaint: MUCH less customization or ability to edit functionality versus the older generation. Ability to customize backup DLNR iTunes indexing? Gone. Ability to name TimeMachine backups? Gone. For me even the renaming of the network name does not work. This needs a better utility.PLUS you authenticate only via WD (it's not a true NAS) and there is NO WAY TO ADD A SECOND DEVICE TO YOUR ACCOUNT! That's right Home is designed to support only one device at a time - which is insane.This also emphasizes another point: You are doing the little control you have 100% through WD's services. If the device is not on the Internet (!) you can't even erase or reset it. If WD were to ever turn their website off - you have basically a brick.The installable app landscape still is much less populated than say Synology (which also has fantastic NAS devices - and which are a better choice for the tinkerer) but as a basic but easy NAS device this is great.Note that you hook this up via your router - this is not a direct-connect (to a computer) device
5,I bought this to store all of our photo's and videos we took of our kids. Yes it is slow to upload all of the images but once they are there it is very simple to open and view the files. Plus you only upload 10-15 years worth of photo's once then from then on out you are only uploading a couple months worth at a time. So the speed isn't a killer for me. You can reorganize the photo's and video and create folders within folders. The MyCloudHome also comes with the Plex app to enable and then we linked our MyCloudhome account we then installed the plex app on our smart TV's and are able to view all of our photo's and videos on our TV (which is great for sharing our photos of trips with family members in lieu of huddling around the laptop or iPad. You can also share a selected number of files to share with friends or family and they can access those files (only) when they want on their own computer. It also works great if you have a large file to give to someone and have no flash drives laying around. No you can not edit files on the drive. You have to edit them saved them and re-upload the file. Again not a big deal for me since I'm only using it to store and view photos and videos for the most part. I've also used the IOS app on my iPhone XR. The iPhone app works just as easy as the website login and desktop app. I also have it set up that it backs my iPhone photos up to MyCloudHome which is great since Apple's free cloud store space is not enough to backup my phone video music etc. Since I still have some concerns with loosing our images I have a copies of everything on external hard drives as well.I actually bought the 4TB MyCloudHome single drive at Best Buy cause it was the same price but i had reward money. I get the feeling alot of the negative reviews are from people that are more computer/network advanced then I am and are trying to get this to do more than what it was designed to do. For the price I think it was def worth it.
2,What is it that they say about gift horses? Lets just sum it up that I was hoping for more here and had I known when I was lining up to get this Personal Cloud device what it can and really can't do I would have passed and waited instead to get something else.  Even now I'm still searching for the right kind of device for my needs.  What are those needs versus what this device does deliver?  Actually it is easier to note that this Personal Cloud device would work in some situations for some users but it is not a more traditional NAS device and the required constant connection back to the mothership over the internet is beyond annoying for what I'm looking for.  I had a Seagate Central device that unfortunately died a few years plus into the service time I was requesting out of it.  When it died I was left looking for alternatives and that is part of what inspired taking a chance on this device.  Unfortunately they aren't the same animal and don't provide the same kind of service.This particular device is something that might work well for someone that is looking for fewer features and a less traditional NAS configuration.  What device would I recommend instead?  Great question that I'm still stuck researching myself.  Even months after getting this and spending time kicking its tires and trying to determine how useful it really is I am left with a 2 star rating here.  Actually probably a 2.5 star rating but not a 3 star as I can't convince myself to say "I like it".  I don't hate it but it just isn't what I would hope for and really I think other options would be much closer to what most people would actually call a traditional NAS type device.
1,I have 4 of these. One died in a year. I'm sure the rest will follow soon. I will have to back up my files in something else before they do. This one just says "offline" forever and the light is faded to indicate that it's offline. No matter how many times you plug it back in it will not work. It's not the wires or internet either bc when I switch with my other clouds it works fine. It's just this cloud that does not work. There is no way to troubleshoot it and there is no one to contact for help with the device. It's just dead and gone. I read that if you send it in to back up your files it's $800. Too bad this $300 drive can't keep our files intact.You can't take the drive out of it and plug it into a SATA reader either from what I read on the internet. Useless.I'll have to buy another external drive and start backing up all my data soon before the other 3 die. Do NOT buy these overpriced useless drives.
1,This is only nominally a network storage device: it supplies very few of the features normally associated with NAS.  It's weak poorly featured and so inflexible as to be essentially unconfigurable.  It can't be partitioned or encrypted and WD's proprietary nonsense makes it incompatible with many  common utilities (e.g. Carbon Copy Cloner).  It rewrites Finder permissions without informed consent - an outrageous violation for any peripheral.  Worse it's unreliable.  Copying very large quantities of files routinely fails for no apparent reason requiring restarting WD's intrusive software.  (Since when does a drive require a client app?  Ridiculous.  Storage should integrate with the OS's file system not subvert it.)From a Mac perspective WD has needlessly reinvented utterly standard approaches to storage that already work far better than anything they've conceived.  The notion of using a web interface to interact with a drive is patently absurd.  It appears designed for hapless technophobes who it will only further confuse.  The whole product drips with condescension.  As usual the attempt to appeal to ignorance will only create more of it.Obviously I'm returning it and buying another vendor's solution something designed for grownups.
1,Short review:  for the less technically inclined use a pure cloud service (Google Drive DropBox 365 whatever); for the tech inclined get a real NAS like a Synology.  There is no upside to this hybrid approach that I can tell.  The WD My Cloud is the biggest piece of garbage I've ever used in 40 years of tech.  I guess it's what happens when a hardware company tries to make software.  I thought I was buying a NAS (lack of research is on me -- I jumped on a "deal").  Instead it is a hard drive with an ethernet port and a layer of the most poorly thought through web-based administrative software you could possibly imagine.  You can turn off many of the "cloud functions" and have it work somewhat as a local network drive again managed through a horrible web UI.  For the more tech inclined it does have BusyBox (the OS is Debian) in which you can perform some very limited management (the whole setup is so brittle I would expect this to break it if you were too adventurous).  There is a russian dude who has hacked different firmware on it.  I'd just sooner move the drive to a USB enclosure and call it a day than go through that.
2,This has a great mobile app which makes it very simple to upload images. Beyond that it's pretty blah.It is stupid you have to have it logged into the website to access your images. Which makes it feel less of a home cloud and more like a public cloud that is housed at home. The transfer and access are at a snails pace. When you use the great mobile app it dumps the photos to the root (apparently) folder of the drive with no easy/quick way to organize. it appends a _1 to the end of duplicate file names which is annoying. I tried using the file backup system and the dropbox like features which take way to long to transfer anything with a great amount of files and the dropbox feature is very poor and doesn't mirror like I would expect (you know having the same files in both places which this drive struggles to do).All in all this drive would be good as strictly a place to drop your photos from your phone for a deep storage. Get a faster drive if you need to do any sort of accessing of the files as this thing takes about a minute to cache 12 image thumbnails in windows.I am going to find a quicker drive an probably retire this (hopefully harvest the drive if possible) only about 4 months of purchase.
3,Storage is defaulted at Raid 1 for 3 TB instead of 6 TB.  Need to format drive to have access to 6 TB.Easy to set up easy to navigate.  Browsing for files and folders is easy.
3,It came with very poor installation instructions just a cartoon card. But once you set up your account on my cloud.com the instructions are there.You connect the drive to your network and then download either Windows app on your desktop or the app on your mobile device. From there you can set up the backup and see the contents on the drive. Once you install the Windows app it maps the Cloud Drive on your desktop. You can also see the contents of your drive on my cloud.com.The user manual is also online. Western Digital has 2 types of cloud drives one is called My Cloud and the other is called My Cloud Home. And this 1 is My Cloud Home.From your iPhone you can set up the automatic backup of pictures to your My Cloud Home Drive.I think the concept is great but the instructions could be a lot better. The user interface could be easier to use. For example I still have not figured out how to automatically backup 1 of my home folders to this my cloud home drive. The 12 TB drive has two 6 TB drives and is set in Mirror Mode (RAID1). The actual usable storage space that shows in the drive is 5.4 TB.
5,I was a bit skeptical about how easy this drive would be to set up but it actually was as easy as promised. I am testing and using two of these devices a 6 TB model and a 12 TB model.Please understand that in the default configuration the actual usable space is about half of that as the drives are set up in a RAID 1 mode – both drives capture the same data – giving you a redundant safety net. If one drive fails the other saves the data and you can replace the failed drive. The system will then restore data to both drives. These are not hot-swappable drives; you need to turn the unit off to swap drives.As I said earlier setup was easy. Literally plug it in connect to the router and use the app (I actually used My Cloud access from an internet browser on a PC) but the app also connected easily. I also activated the Alex My Cloud Home skill quickly – but learning the syntax to access music on the drive still eludes me.The 6 TB drive is used by a recording studio I am working with. The producer has access to all folders and each artist he works with has their own folder with their own material. In this capacity it acts similar to Drop Box – except you own the drive and don’t pay for access. We also created a backup of the main computer in the studio to be stored on the same drive.The 12 TB drive will be my personal cloud for backing up all my devices (4 laptops a tablet and two phones) as well as storing video photos and music to access from any of those devices. Doing any of this is pretty easy from either a phone or browser.  You can also plug in flash drives to bet them automatically backed up as well.When I first got these I was concerned that the fact that they weren’t a traditional Network Attached Storage device (NAS) and wondered if they would handle a variety of applications but they do what they promised. T will not serve as a traditional NAS but having your own cloud server can be quite handy and these devices serve that need quite well.
1,Total piece of junk both SW and HW.  Buggy user interface and slow transfers - u can forget about using it to stream video content it just pauses regularly.  Get a real NAS - this is not one.
2,I bought one of these to share files with a few friends over the internet. It is a pain because this requires every user to create their own account but then they all have access to the drive and can put their private folders on there and no one can see what everyone is doing. You have to share each individual folder to each account. Ended up just using one account and trusting them with the info-(close friends no worries). For my application it worked but DO NOT expect this to work like a nas. Do not expect Plex to work smoothly. WD could of made this a great device but decided not to it seems. For an individual just storing files to access here and there it makes sense. To give a few people private access to a storage drive too. Any other way is a major pain. I must say the app runs ok.
5,Easy setup very pleased
4,Backup
3,I seriously don't like when an app forces you to leave a review before you can actually use it!
1,The old WD MyCloud was fairly easy to set up and use. It was intuitive: you found it as a device on your network connected to it set it up either through the web or directly through an interface. A little daunting for a new user but fairly straightforward.With MyCloud Home it looks like they tried to simplify it but instead pretty much rendered it useless. I'm a device geek and have a pretty good threshold for dealing with setups but this one had me boxing it back up in 30 minutes.The setup was easy enough. Plug it in go to a website find your device make an account. Looked promising. But that was about it. After that the website the only place to make settings gives "server error" when trying to connect to the settings on the device. The helpful text: Please try again later. No troubleshooting. No status page nothing. Whenever you go to the website it tells you you need to update the mobile app for the latest features. Even if you install the mobile app that popup comes up every single time. Not smart enough to put a cookie on the device with an option of don't ask me again. Their mac and windows apps are useless... you can find your device and then click a button for settings that takes you back to the useless web page. The device unlike the previous version does not show up in network discovery as a device: you have to install the client to see it. And there seems to be no direct access to the device itself.I suppose if you're looking to make a more frustrating Google Drive that you have to support instead of letting Google take care of it this would be a great option. For anyone else... try and find the old version without the "Home" or just use Google.
4,This drive worked seamlessly with both my Macs doing wifi backups.  It was easy to install and comes with some good utilities. The only complaint I have is that it is noisier than I expected.  It sites 3 feet from me and when it is working the noise is noticeable.
3,I wanted a storage unit that could be access locally and over the internet. This cannot be access locally which limits my use a lot.Also uploads to your phone must be done individually. I have a client's file and I had to upload each item instead of the whole file.
3,Why because it forced me to write a review before allowing me to upload today. So there!
4,I think in the hands of someone more tech-savvy than me this would be a really powerful storage device.  I need a whole bunch of instructions spelled out for me for devices like this and does not come with a whole bunch of instructions.  I am probably not the target audience for the Western Digital My Cloud and I feel way out of my depth trying to review this product even after having and using it for two months now.What drew me to this device was the hope of having a huge storage drive to make my Mac Time Machine back-ups automated.  This device isn't meant for that type of thing. So if you know enough about computing to be dangerous (like me) and you're drawn to this cloud device in hopes that you'll have something that'll revolutionize your Time Machine backups this won't be what you're looking for.
2,User interface for sharing could be easier
4,Great
2,I purchased WD My Cloud Home 10 months ago setup went smooth and start moving all family pictures to it (I thought it’s a reliable place to save valued pictures). unfortunately it kept restarting every few minutes and never able to have access for the last 2 months I contacted customer support (incident #: 200510-001282) and the guys ran through very basic procedures of restarting resting and told SORRY we can’t help they refer me to third party to back up my data which expect the cost to be $800-3000 which is way too much specially with current environment.Anybody from WD imagine how much pain they made with this unreliable product and poor support they provide.
2,With Windows there is a desktop plugin that allows the drive to appear in your file explorer which is handy no such luck using Linux everything (desktop) must happen through a web interface which is annoying.  Additionally there was recently a software update which completely changed the way the public folder works and I'm trying to explain to my daughter in law how to use the thing and she's not seeing the same thing on her phone that I am and it became completely awkward and non-intuitive on how to move stuff never mind that I can't copy stuff it has to be moved. And why do the developers just assume that photos is pretty much all I'm concerned with? If the thing were just laid out like a logical file system and let the user decide what to do and how they want to do it it would be much easier to use and navigate.
5,The features and access available on the WD My Cloud Home are comparable to those offered by cloud service providers such as Dropbox Box Google Drive and OneDrive. The only method of accessing the WD My Cloud Home is via WD's web service where the drive connects when provided with power and internet access. In essence the WD My Cloud Home is identical to cloud service providers except that the user has physical possession of the hardware storing their files and no subscription fees. There is no local access to the device differentiating it from traditional NAS storage devices and eliminating the possibility of using it as a standard external hard drive. This device has a niche market: individuals (or families friends etc.; the device has the ability to configure independent user accounts with private access to files) interested in cloud storage that want control over physical access to the hardware.In my case I am using the WD My Cloud Home to continuously backup my existing cloud storage through a service provider. This is made possible because WD has a feature that allows the WD My Cloud Home to mirror the contents from several of the most popular cloud service providers. I have previously achieved this by running a computer 24/7 with the folder for cloud service providers stored on an always-connected external hard drive. The WD My Cloud Home simplifies this by eliminating the need to keep a computer running 24/7 and I don't have to worry about the many updates crashes and restarts that may bring a computer offline. It does come at the cost of losing local access to the drive but serves its purpose well at keeping a continuous backup of my existing cloud storage. It's entirely possible that a cloud service provider offers this feature but the WD My Cloud Home does it well and without the recurring cost of a subscription.
2,Beware! This drive requires it be wired to a wifi router  the router connect to internet and wifi active.  You cannot wire it via ethernet either directly to a computer or via a LAN to control it or access data.  So no wifi and/or internet = no access to your data.  AND even worse ... any search function is limited ONLY to folders - NOT the files in the folders.  Thus it stores lots of files you cannot find by name size type or date etc.
2,If you plan on using it as plex media server then don't bother. Really disappointing I'll detail why- you are forced to use only one file path for each type of media (movies tv shows pictures...) you can't for example split movies into two libraries (kids and adults) no matter what you try.- I haven't been able to get remote access to work at all.- you can't add any agents other than the default ones.If buying neither of these are an issue to you I think it's somewhat fine
1,Its like buying a stripped down flip phone in the era of smart phones.It is NOT an upgrade if you have the previous model My Cloud. The My Cloud Home is so basic and limited that it will make you regret purchasing.My biggest problem with it is that it ISN'T DLNA capable... which means your smart TV wont see it.You have to use some third party app and set up your content there to be able to see it on your Roku or smart tv.They downgraded the capabilities the previous version of the drive you could make private and public folders.Private you had to log in to view and the public were accessible through your smart tv and devices. What it does do is have the ability of creating multiple accounts that are password enabled so everyone can share the same storage.It's big and ugly the design was not very elegant once i unpacked it. The power cord felt like a really cheap wire with very little insulationSuffice it to say I returned it since the whole point was to use it to watch content on all my devices/tvs/tablets while keeping some folders private.WD you have failed me.
1,I dunno if I've ever given a single star review before (actually I am sure ...and I haven't ...I don't do reviews of stuff I don't like). And I hate giving one for a new product like this. Especially one with hardware that is much improved over its predecessor.But.WTH was WD thinking? I mean they took one of the all-time bargains in a NAS (the My Cloud) and *this* is the result? The WD My Cloud Home is a disaster.Essentially WD lobotomized a sterling product. Sure sure the new model is inarguably better HW spec'd. But jeezus: they dumbed it down to the point where it's TOTALLY unsuitable for deployment in a small businesses.Look. It's not a NAS. It's a ...let's call it a cloud drive of some sort. Kind of. And ...if you don't have the foggiest what a NAS is ...and can barely figure out how to attach to your wireless ...and your router is a total mystery to you ...this is your cloud drive. Everyone else? - Go elsewhere. This is too stupid for you.I'm returning the four purchased earlier this week (purchased at BB who had a better price). If you're a techie or you've used the previous My Cloud fair warning: don't bother.(Note: I'm a sys admin with 30 years in the field providing tech solutions to small businesses. Take that how you will.)
2,When it is connected to my network it's fine for my purposes. The issue I have is that when Windows is updated I must sign back in to WD Home again. This is unsatisfactory to me.  I have several machines and so this gets to be a nuisance.  It is also very slow compared to NASs I have seen in the homes and offices of friends and associates.While the quality of the hardware is decent enough for my needs it is just too flaky. You can do better elsewhere.
5,Significantly impressed with this cloud! Syncing is done in the background and is very effortless.
4,I like that we have our own cloud storage rather than having it on someone elses server but if I wasn't technically inclined I would not have been able to setup this item easily.  It took the better part of 4 hours to get it up and running the way I needed it and then it took a bit of time to get each item to connect to it that I wanted to use with it.  Now that it's setup it works like a charm with no issues thus far.  I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't want information out on several other cloud servers around the world.
5,I'm not sure why people are giving this negative reviews.  I read the description provided by the manufacturer and it does exactly what it's supposed to.  Yes you need an internet connection.  That's what "CLOUD" means.  If you want a product to be something it's not you can't blame the product.  Learn how to read first.  This couldn't be easier to set up.  If you're looking for an easy way to access files from anywhere in the world without paying for some cloud service this does a great job.  The phone apps seem fine the PC app also.  My families main use for this product is the overload of pictures in our phone.  Place them on the cloud drive and access them from anywhere.  Then free up the memory on your phone.  I love this thing but having purchased the 4TB version I would recommend purchasing one with even more storage.. I haven't run out of space yet but I'm sure eventually I'll need more space.
2,I purchased one of these at BestBuy to backup my laptop computers with Acronis True Image 2020.  I was able to add a backup in True Imange but I could not get the backup to run.  It would error out early in the process with a device connectivity error.There is some info from WD about using True Imange WD edition.  I have the full version directly from Acronis.The prescribed method is to backup to the public share which has no security.This device does seem to work well to backup photos from iPhones and iPads.
5,The WD Mycloud Home device is as simple as it is elegant. The setup advertises that it can be done from a smartphone and I took that as a challenge. I successfully setup the NAS and configured all the settings I could all from my phone. All the applications that come default to the NAS like Plex also worked seamlessly. From the mobile experience to the desktop app nothing was confusing to use. The UI is not dramatically different from one device to another. Even the difference between JBOD and RAID1 is explained clearly very nice for the non-tech savvy.Accessing the device outside the local network is also simple. The device integrates into WD’s online portal allowing access to files on the NAS over the web. It truly does feel like a cloud service not an on-prem NAS. You sign in with your email can access files through a desktop app smartphone app or web browser.However there is a downside to all of this. First there is a sharp lack of customization. Aside from the half-dozen services offered you cannot add additional functionality. Don’t expect to SSH into this device the port is closed. Accessing the NAS through SMB is possible but it isn’t clear what username/password to use since the only accounts are email-based. I tried a few things but was only able to access the Public folders.In summary this device is excellent for anyone who wants to self-host their files and avoid trusting ‘big cloud’ with their digital existence. Everything about the experience is seamless. But don’t expect anything beyond the walled-garden. This device trades customization for experience. If you want customization or know what SSH is this device isn’t aimed at you.Pros:- Easy setup- Well-designed UI- Simple cloud integration- Quiet device- Very good suite of apps- Easy to use- Simple photo backup from a smartphone/tablet- No extra setup needed to access files remotely- Small device- Front indicator light is not blinding at nightCons:- Not very customizable- No SSH- Could not access authenticated files through Ubuntu file browser
4,The My Cloud Home was fast and convenient to setup; it's as close to plug and play as you'll find and virtually made dummy-proof.  Even non-tech inclined individuals will have no problems hooking this up.  Once hooked up you've got half the storage listed (RAID I is default so one drive is mirrored therefore only half of the total storage capacity) you can change this if you do not require the backup.The ease of setup and convenience also  gets in the way of some function.  This could really be improved by including a local connection.  Plugging this into your router or home PC would add more protection/security and not require all of your traffic to touch the internet.
2,I was sold this at a local Best Buy to use as backup for my  laptop.  Whoops.  It was too late to return it once I discovered my Acronis Backup software can't see it.  You can drag and drop files to it and it is a good backup for your phone but not what I was looking for.  You can download their discovery software that will allow you to drag and drop from windows explorer but it is not a NAS device and backup software cannot see it.
2,I have an older WD Cloud that I love. It is defined to my private internal network and has securely backed up my files for several years. I wanted a another unit that would provide second set of backups that I could move offsite. Warning: primary reason for poor rating is because WD requires you to define the system to their portal now exposing it to Internet! I consider this to introduce a couple potential risks and therefore would not want to store any critical personal data on this system which kind of defeats the purpose of buying a backup system to protect your data. If I wanted my data up on the Internet there are numerous 3rd party cloud vendors to do that.
5,Alright everyone I've read most of these reviews and I have to say I'm quite disappointed. Not in the product but in the technical know how of most of the consumers purchasing this product.1. This is a SIMPLE! Personal Cloud. Keyword is SIMPLE. Don't expect to be able to stream to 10+ users @ 4k with transcoding while transferring 4k footage to it at the same time. This is for the home user who wants SECURITY PROTECTION and ACCESSABILITY.2. I am no IT professional but I do have common sense. Lets look at the rest of the market and see what RAID 1 8 TB NAS boxes are going for....not for 350 - 400$. So to think you're getting a true RAID 1 8tb NAS at this price point....come on. What you do get is 4tb MIRRORED! Which makes it 8tb of storage hence the DUO in the name of the product.3. This is literally plug and play. I don't know jack about the higher levels of NAS I simply wanted something that I could work on my projects at home VIA my desktop and while I travel VIA my laptop. This fits the bill just fine. The transfer speeds aren't the best. Averaging 10 - 45 mbps. Which is not horrible but not blazing fast. I think a weak point might be my internet speed. Verizon FIOS 100mbps however I have a lot of tech hooked up to my wifi so that might be a problem resolved with faster internet.4. Also this HAS to be plugged into the internet to work. Hence the CLOUD. Otherwise get an external HDD and plug that into your router and your set.To bring it all home if you're looking for a simple plug and play NAS that offers protection without a whole lot of frills. This is it. All you gotta do is this.1. Plug in the ethernet cable to your router and your Cloud Home Duo.2. Plug in the power cord3. go to mycloud.com/hello4. follow the instructions download the windows app for the WD Discovery5. you're done
2,This thing was looking great...plug in two wires install the app create an account and you have a shared drive accessible on all your computers (and iPad).  You can access the shared drive even if you aren’t at home on your LAN and you can get to the files when on another computer using the website. Pretty cool!However I had a couple of problems that made this thing an overall disappointment.  First the drive just drops offline on my iMac sometimes...usually when I am in a hurry.  Secod My Drive just doesn’t seem to be able to handle Pages documents.  This is the main thing we want to share between our computers.  The documents can be uploaded and downloaded fine but working with a document that resides on the My Cloud drive consistently crashes Pages or results in error messages.  Finally My Cloud just doesn’t work with iPad.  I actually use Pages on my iPad quite regularly (with a Bluetooth keyboard).  My Cloud is unable to handle document files for iPad.  It is pretty much limited to backing up your pictures (and maybe some other media...I didn’t mess with it any more once I figured out it wasn’t going to be useful for me).Bottom line if you are a Mac/iPad user who wants a shared drive for Pages documents you should try something else.  Since I have the My Drive now I use it for general backup and media files; for Pages Documents the Dropbox app seems to be working fine.
4,Very easy to install. The app works smoothly and automatically backs up photos from our cell phones. There is also desktop access to backup and transfer files that way. Though it is 12TB it's really 6TB of backup space since the drives are mirrored. That's still plenty of space for us. We are primarily using it to backup photos since we have an infant and take lots of them. It is a bit slow to upload. My wife and I are each able to backup our phones through separate accounts but we cannot access one another's backups unless we log in under that account. There should be a setting to give permission to other users to access their files.
2,I bought this from Micro Center as a general network storage device and Time Machine backup device.  In short it doesn't effectively do either of those things.  The drive slows to a crawl when loaded over half capacity.  The Time Machine share is horribly cheaply implemented and becomes useless after a few uses.  WD's management capability is nil...you cannot fix these problems using their "cloud" interface.If you only want to be able to share photo libraries with people over the "cloud" maybe this thing is for you...if you know what Network Attached Storage is and want those features this thing is NOT for you.
1,I followed the (probably too basic) directions.  The light came on steadied and then what???  I didn't know what to do after that.  How does the transfer happen????  There were no directions on how to actually transfer the pics and videos to my computer.  I went to my computer looking for a symbol.  A folder for My Cloud finally appeared but only 80 pics transferred on their own from my phone.  The app is a JOKE.  No help at all.  I just needed it to work.  It should have been super easy but It was perpetually stuck in "PREPARING BACKUP"  for HOURS!!!!  I went to a message board and nobody had an answer.  Forget it I said.  I literally did not want to spend hours on message boards and you tube trying to do something that should have just happened automatically.  I returned the mess and bought a plain old hard drive.  So much for that foolishness.  Do better WD!!!!  Either get with it or get out the game!  Wasting folks time!!!
1,I was hoping that WD would get their act together but after reading these reviews I see nothing has changed.  I own a WD My Book Live that worked great for years.  It is still functioning today but I can only use the accessing features from the app and other computers when I am at home only and on the same network.  Which is one of the main reasons I bought it.  These clowns at WD decided to not support the software anymore a few years back.  At first I thought it was broken but after reaching out to tech support that was the answer I was given.  I get it sometimes businesses cannot support all their products after their life cycle but there was no warning or notification from Western Digital which kind of upset me.  Anyway I am going to save my money and not buy this product.
2,Doing a TM backup to this device is a great way to grow old. Been trying to back up a 250GB SSD with wired Ethernet connection from Mac to My Cloud Home. After 3-4 days it's still not complete for first backup. This is not an appropriate use for this device.
1,I bought this confusing product and maybe just maybe it would work properly if you could figure it out which you could maybe do if only you could get decent tech support.But dealing with tech support has been one of the worst support nightmares I've ever experienced. Based on my own experience (a) you will find it nearly impossible to understand them if you're not an expert understanding an Indian accent. They won't slow down when you ask them to and they will not transfer you to an American call center nor pass you on to someone without a nearly indecipherable accent. (2) They don't seem to have anyone there who really understand a Mac. At best they'll have to consult manuals. Or as they once said they have one guy who understands Mac but he's "out." (3) You'll make multiple phone calls over time and literally spend a total of HOURS trying to resolve the simplest thing. (4) Info you're given one time will be retracted as a mistake later. (5) You cannot password protect this device; in Time Machine you have to sign onto the device as a Guest. But this advice comes only after lots of troubleshooting that doesn't work. (6) If a thief steals your device they'll be able to see all your data. At least that's what they told me as a correction to what they had said earlier which was the opposite.What horrible customer service and what inept hard to understand tech support. Buy their products and risk crying later.
2,So when it logs out (pc restarts or pc is disconnected from the internet) you have to fill in your username password every time. This might seem like I'm being picky but if you have a laptop and have to do this a lot it will get old.It also has some of the issues mentions by other reviewers but the fact the wd program can't remember your username/password (something that every other program can now do)  is just lazy programming on their part. This device is pretty great on paper they just need to fix some things.
4,I purchased this from BestBuy but did come here to read reviews first.  Some reviews said that the drive can be only managed through WD app and that actually did concern me.  I bought it anyways but gladly found out it CAN be managed as a local drive.  See my screenshot it was actually mapped as Z: drive.To clarify: I bought this to be my 2nd copy of all my contents and my requirements are very basic.  This review is not applicable if your requirements are more complicated.
1,I used this drive for 8 months. Then it failed. I was unable to recover any data myself. When using the WD tech support I was informed that they "do not charge for data recovery" and to submit a "Return Material Authorization".  This is NOT what it sounds like. Upon receiving the drive they ERASE ALL DATA & send a "REFURBISHED" unit.  I have since learned via other "support technicians" that WD does not offer any data recovery .... Hence why they "do not charge for it". They also do not do any type of reimbursement for data recovery. So If your drive fails.... You have to PAY to get YOUR DATA & get a USED unit back... LESS THAN 1 YEAR. SUPPORT WAS A JOKE! They constantly send you to page after page to read & self diagnose instead of actually helping. DO NOT BUY!!!
1,This is my first review on any product. I have to say I try not to read too much on negative reviews but have to do it. Bought this with the intent on saving the tons of pics my wife and I take on our phones and save storage. I always had minor problems with it not connecting or being offline but eventually got it to work. But in less than 2 years I started to get a blinking white light and it would say offline. I researched the problem online and did not sound too promising. So I took it to a technician and was told that they could not recover any of my files and that all my pictures had been lost. That's 8 years of pictures from my oldest daughter to my youngest GONE! What a pile of garbage.
5,Over all great cloud storage
1,The product is not anything like the WD Mycloud NAS.  It has a shared network facing folder that can be used as a typical public share however this folder cannot be seen by the internet facing private storage area or vice versa.  The private user storage area is just that a  private single user cloud storage area such as Dropbox Google Drive One Drive Etc.  You cannot make shared folders and manage permissions instead you would copy a link to the folder and share the link like Dropbox.  There was no shared area that all users could see from the private side but after complaints WD hotfixed a "family" shared folder that is shared with other users of the drive but the folder cannot be modified in any way. Any users of the drive have to make an account at my cloud home dot com and either use the web interface desktop software. or smartphone app to use the private storage area.  This product cannot be assigned a static IP address so network admins that like to stack device types in certain ranges are out of luck.  There is no way to turn off internet facing ports or services like on the mycloud.  Even though everyone lists this product in their NAS product category don't be fooled it doesn't have any basic NAS functionality. I will be returning the one I bought and purchasing the original wd mycloud  the mycloud ex or another brand NAS.
5,I'm giving this Personal Cloud Storage (2TB) from the WD My Cloud line five stars because if you buy it for exactly what it is it is simple to install and operate via apps (both on the pc and phone).  What it is not is NAS storage.  It can only be accessed from the internet and has no offline support.This works great for auto backups that you can always depend on because the drive is never offline.  Of course this state of affairs worries lots of people when it comes to the security of their information and files being always open to the internet and potential hackers.  I personally don't have much of anything worth hacking into and I always forget to back things up and I always wind up doing full restores and starting over after having lost a boat load of pictures and vids etc.  So for me this Is perfect.  You can control everything concerning this drive from an app on your phone (which is remarkably sophisticated for WD) or similarly on your PC (there are apps for both).She Who Must Be Obeyed is much more security minded than I am and She doesn't like not being about to take the drive offline and access the information on it locally (since it's sitting right there...and I can see her point).  I'm sure that any techie can bypass all that and just use the drive the way they want but your average consumer needs to know what they're getting into before they buy it.But if you're like me and want your backing up to be simplified to cave man levels then this is the toy for you.  I'm happy with it so I'm giving it Five Stars.Any longevity issues...or if it gets hacked...I'll come back and lower the rating and redo the review.
1,I bought the 4TB cloud at Best Buy and it worked great in the beginning. The convenience to keep all my photos and files accessible on my phone or any computer at any time was great. About 8 months in and I have been soley using the cloud to keep my photos and other files I access on different computers and then the unit just went offline and never came back on. Had about 1.3TB of important files that I had to pay almost $300 for a local tech shop to get the files back. I don't understand why they didn't add an option for local access via computer but that was their stupidest mistake with this. Don't buy a clout device unless you can locally access it and thanks to Western Digital for making me throw my money away.
2,Title says it all.  This is really not a NAS device.  Very little network functionality.  It’s basically a dumb version of Google Drive.
4,This is truly a plug amd play cloud storage device for those of us who don't know a lot about  computers.I have never stored anything on the Cloud and am therefore quite skiddish.  But I take a lot of pictures so to store those seemed like a good idea and fairly safe as well.  So far so good.  A little slow at times which could be our network as well but otherwise it works fine.  I received the 2 TB version which is a single drive
4,Delightfully small footprint and exceedingly quiet. App to get her up and running is easy to use- only amusing tech complaint we had there came from having no option apart from 'yes' during set up when the app asked if the light on the device was steady. What if it hadn't been? The 6TB version contains two separate 3TB drives which can be removed by the user so the device is user service-able in that regard. Working well. Must be hard wired cannot function through a tether.
1,I have this device placed in my living room however it is making a brumming sound constantly which is coming from its hard drive. It difficult to ignore and live with hence I have contacted the supplier in order to return it back. Furthermore its not good at streaming videos since the playing experience is not smooth but is filled with jittering occurrences. It harddisk that is inside it is extremely show just moving a picture from two folders both within the server takes minutes!.Its completely useless as a storage device not try to save money buying this "cheap" product rather save some money and buy any other brand than western digital
2,Not a great product. The software freezes a lot on my computer. When I try to reupload after it froze I get an unknown error message. I recommend looking for another product besides this one. I'm thinking of returning it and getting a better one when I find another one.
4,I am not new to Western Digital My Cloud' and I've found this '2TB Home cloud storage' functions as advertised. I had no difficulty setting it up nor any trouble communicating uploads/downloads through mobile devices; I've found it works nicely with "Plex" "Dropbox" and others too My only negative comment involves directions as none are supplied with the unit and the user is at the mercy of a not particularly friendly - as in confusing - website. And it would've been nice had a USB cable been included. But perhaps I'm asking too much.
2,I've used external hard drives before; I have tons of photo video and documents that I've needed and wanted to save over the years. When I say this cloud system I thought I would give it a try. I've not been very pleased.I'm not super techy but here are my observations...No local access. Must be connected to internet.Slow transfer speed.Can't transfer folders.This product may be a good fit for some but It's not really worth my time to use this thing. I was just looking for a larger more effective way to store my important stuff but this wasn't it. I'll go back to external hard drives..
1,All the other negative reviews are absolutely correct.  Western Digital marketing department took a dump on this one and you can tell that they actually had to truncate features of the CPU in order to dumb this thing down and enforce an internet discovery protocol.  The write speeds are abysmal.  I've pulled out the WD Red 6TB and put it into a Synology DS2119j where it is much happier.  The resulting chassis and CPU board can be used for a hack project to load up an Android playground with ENTWARE if you are so inclined.  I'll put that on the project shelf with other stuff to torture myself with in my spare time.  For the meantime getting this junk OFF your network asap will relieve some torture if you were foolish enough to purchase it as I was.  If you are wondering if you should purchase. . . DON'T!
1,This was worse storage device I have ever worked with even though I am a IT professional.  The software is terrible and only being able to manage through the internet and not being able to setup manually from the internal network and easily assign drives through Windows is one of the worse lack of critical features I have seen. Tech support was even worse.  I spent over 90 minutes on chat and had to continually explain the issue.  Finally they RAN the original and I knew it would have the same issue which it did so I returned for credit.  I will never buy additional hardware from WD.  I do not know how they stay in business in the home or small business market.the only
1,This thing is literally 24 inches from my blazing fast laptop and directly connected (wired connection ) to my 500 Mbps router. And transferring files to it/from it is about as fast as if it were on Mars. Why would anybody want this? If you want a cloud service you can use OneDrive or Google Drive or Dropbox or ... I wanted it to have a private drive accessible remotely. Instead this manages all traffic through Western Digital even when it and my computer are on the same LAN. Do you trust WD with your privacy more than the other guys? At least their services are reasonably fast and they manage backups. There is no advantage to this whatsoever. This is just stupid.
5,Easy to use
1,Don’t buy this if you know anything at all about computers. If you don’t know anything you may already be accustomed to feeling helpless and unable to do anything you want if you aren’t accustomed to that feeling you soon will be. It only works if you have a fast connection to the internet and western digital servers are working.Don’t ever buy one if you value your sanity
5,Plex works great
4,Easy to set up. Does backup!  Can download your Dropbox and Facebook content to itself. Content on your  computer's drives can be dragged and dropped..So far I'm impressed.That the "Duo" maintains redundant storage is a plus. Recommended! I've yet to try phone apps but don't use my phone for purposes where I would necessarily need to.
1,I am so frustrated with this device. It adds strange documents to my folders with random letters like $*#(@*docume39191. This is out of nowhere! I honestly don't even know if it's backing up my stuff I see a constant turning arrow and only some have a checkmark. This device is NOT simple. AT ALL. I feel bad for people who aren't tech saavy who have this device. I see on the web people saying things like "reformat the driver and download FLUFFY198383919 and go to system preferences then blah blah" always BS! Can't I just plug a device in and have it back my stuff up? Simple? Easy? The Seagate setup for my PS4 was a dream. WD for Cloud? A LITERAL NIGHTMARE.
1,This is the worst product I ever bought!Please look for something differentConfiguration was hard and difficultThe device is slow and mycloud.com is very slow to useAnd now the service is down and they say it could be 2 days until they fix it!And I cannot access my files until they fix the service problem.Anything else would be better then this.
1,Please do not buy this product and throw away your money. In the beginning I loved to have my own storage but it took only 3 months until I change my mind. First of all if you move your product to reconnect you have to go through whole lot of hassle. Second if your home ever experience power outage then it's done you wouldn't be able to access to your data anymore. Lastly the "technician" doesn't know what the hell they are doing other than telling you to turn off turn back on press reset button for 10s 30s or 60s. How the hell the manufacturer doesn't know how to fix their product.
2,I purchased this to use with a Bose SoundTouch system.  After hours of struggling and dealing with support it turns out that these WD drives are notorious for not working with Bose and Sonos systems like they should—particularly the Bose systems.  I just had to return the drive.
2,I'm a professional photographer and used this as my primary external for backup. This drive sucks! First of all it
1,I didn't buy this device but I have had only terrible experiences with WdMyCloud.  I am shocked that they make any Top 10 list anywhere.These devices have massive storage but this whole line constantly has connectivity issues.  I understand that part of the problem is Microsoft connectivity issues (e.g. patch update setting changes etc.) but the after sale service is just non-existent.  You have to email them and then wait for days to get an answer back.  Again I am shocked that these things are as popular as they are as you need a bit of an IT hat to trouble shoot them.
1,After losing my password for the device software I tried to reset the password online on the WD site but never got any emails back from WD My cloud so I called customer support (PS: the phone number is highly unavailable you have to search the internet pretty hard to find it) only to find out that they wanted to charge me $199 for the simple service of resetting my password when a brand new device costs less than that. What a rip off! once your free support is gone forget it...Time to switch my storage to another brand...I had this product for a few years what I can say it does the job of storing your files and it's OK if accessing files from your main computer but the device is often offline when I try to access it from my iPhone. So much for cloud storage...looking for pictures can be frustrating as the device works slow and takes forever to show previews
1,DO NOT BUY! We had all our shared files on this WD drive which WD set up and assured us the backup was working properly. The internal drive failed and guess what - the WD backup was also corrupted. We have lost all our files and have no backup. WD tech support is hopelessly under-trained and has a shallow knowledge base. We took the defunct drive to the Geek Squad and even their recovery team couldn't retrieve a single file. They said the disk itself was unreadable. My wife lost two completed manuscripts due to her publisher all her promotional material and I lost all my articles for publication.  DO NOT BUY!
2,Very good Timemachine box for MAC but nothing else.I still cannot figure out how to set up SMB.DNLA is not supported (only through Plex)I have used WD mycloud even that one has very slow processor and only support limited features much better than this one.
5,I must admit to a hesitation in installing the Home Due cloud server dreading the expected complexity of formatting mapping and connecting the drive to gain the cloud storage benefits. As it turned out this may be the simplest piece of technology to install that I have ever encountered; I’ve had more struggle with a mouse. The installation card contains no words graphically showing the four steps necessary to plug the drive in to your router boot it up and log in to the web service to set up an account and log in to your personal cloud.Once you’ve loaded your data onto the drive it is now accessible via the “cloud” on your secure drive. Your data can be accessed via an Android or iOS app on your mobile devices and you are no longer bound to the whims of a cloud provider. The whole system is well-designed; once I installed the Android app it began to back up the data on my phone to the cloud drive automatically a nice benefit. The 12tb unit that I have has a storage limit of 6tb. The Home Duo configures the pair of drives as a RAID system mirroring one to the other. The benefit is that your cloud storage on the drive is protected against casual loss (keeping the possibility of catastrophic loss in mind.)I’m still thrilled with the ease of installation and use of Home Duo. The data centralization alone is a huge benefit to any home network but the mobile access to the data makes that benefit exponentially greater. I have a NAS installed on the same network but this may prove to be much more valuable in the long run.
1,I bought this in haste and did not do enough research.  I will not return it because I have already loaded my personal data on it and there is no way to securely wipe it.Main issues:- It does not support power management to hibernate the disk when idle (which is 99.99% of the time for my usage).  It just spins 24/7.- File access through windows explorer works fine for me but I have not figured out how to make it work for the rest of my family.  They can only access the files through a browser.- I would not count on this device as a back-up drive as I prefer something that connects directly to Windows PC.
4,If you read the description and understand that this is cloud storage system and not a NAS then there's no need to be upset that its not a NAS.  Many reviews here complain that its not an NAS.  It does not claim to be.As a web based storage device it works well.  If you want a NAS I suggest you buy a NAS.
1,This drive is ONLY wireless. It cannot be connected by USB to a computer. It transfers via the internet - so sitting next to my desktop data has to go from my computer to the internet to the drive. I wanted to transfer some large folders and simply could not do it. I'm doing a work around where I'm transferring to an external drive and then transferring via USB and THE MOBILE APP ONLY to the drive. And when I was clear with WD that I was deeply disappointed with this product they refused to take a return because it was after their return date. Frankly when a customer hates your product and wants to do a good faith return of it you don't hide behind your policies. It was within the first 90 days and i did not have the time to figure out how bad this product was before the return date. If you want to transfer tiny amounts of data slowly this is the drive for you. Otherwise GET SOMETHING ELSE.
2,I was disappointed to learn that this device can not be managed locally but only through the internet at all times. This does not make sense.
2,This product does not work as advertised
1,This could be the most over advertised device available today. I purchased this item with the idea that it would be easy to configure and make available to the devices and users in my house. What I found after purchase and setup is that the device is constantly going offline (I have 15+ yrs in the IT field) even though it is connected directly to my router which I have had no issues with. There is not a local admin interface to the device and will not allow for a static IP address either. I am using a Macbook Pro with Catalina and as a result the desktop app has yet to be finished and so it is unsupported. Basically it is junk to put it nicely. Don't waste your money.
1,Somehow this machine that is supposed to store your information deleted 2 TB of work which equates to two years of information/work. Contacted WD and their technical support was horrible all they told me to do was to turn it off then on three different ways. I even paid a data recovery company to search for my files and they were only able to find 15% of my deleted files all because of the way the equipment works. Once you delete a file its is deleted forever it doesn't go to a recycle bin which is the WORST idea ever.
1,** DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT**This is NOT a REAL NAS. It relies on a custom protocol for their “private space” that is completely unreliable. You can’t get a stable enough connection half the time to copy over any decent size files. At least the drive sitting in there is a WD red. I’m going to rip it out and buy another NAS (probably Synology). WD should be ashamed of releasing such a terrible product. I mean they are one of the biggest names in NAS drives. Why they would screw up so much push out a device like this is baffling. Luckily I picked it up on sale so the difference between buying the drive it has inside and the MyCloudHome was like $20. So keep shopping if you want a device you can trust to store your files on.
4,NA
1,Do not water your time or money! Had this piece of garbage for 4 hours before it went offline and wouldn’t come back online. Called “tech support”... what a joke! Their idea of troubleshooting was to make sure it was plugged in. After several calls and incompetent reps I was told to do a soft reset now the device won’t even power on and all my files are gone. Their response.... to pay for data recovery and they send me another worthless piece of crap! Spare yourself the headache DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!
1,Is your hard drive full? Are you looking to backup on an external hard drive? Looking for a place to store your time machine backups? When your 15th attempt at a Time Machine backup fails and you try to scour the dense and unnavigable series of articles WD calls customer support you will be reminded they TOLD you back up times would be slower on a mac (didn't see that on the box) and it's your own damn fault anyway because you don't have the right modem or maybe it's your computer but what it definitely isn't this glamorous paperweight. Also frequently crashes my desktop trying to retrieve files once stored. This was an expensive purchase I wish I had bought a regular external harddrive don't let these villains swindle you.
2,Not at all what I was expecting features-wise. This is PERSONAL storage. The only way to share files is through a clunky web-based interface. If you need personal backup go for it. If you're looking for a NAS solution for family or business avoid this product.
1,I bought this to be a file server to keep our files centrally located and accessible from multiple laptops and mobile devices.  This does NOT do what I wanted it to.  It can't read my PSD files and the music library option is awful on this.  It only seems to work with Alexa-enabled devices. NO thank you.  I can't even download my own music from my own library off of it onto my mobile devices.  It works fine for the standard JPG photos and files but for an audio library this does not function at all for us.  I spent 3 days backing everything up just to find this out.  It's going back so I can get something that will actually function for us.
1,Husband bought this thinking this was a newer version of the older My Cloud. IT'S NOT! If you are using this for only one person then it may work fine but if you are using this to share files between a family or more than one person forget it. There are no true shared files. Contacted Western Digital and they flat out saif this wasn't made for that. And if you want to stream files from this you will be paying a monthly fee.
4,I'm a writer and a photographer. This helps me feel secure as another back-up to my files.
4,I wanted this to work perrfectly for me but it didn't.  To caveat this it is attached to my router and my service is slower than most people (~12 MBPS).  For me it just take too long and doesnt work well due to this.  For anyone with a fast connection it should be fine.
1,It's the 4 tb My Cloud Home device.......terrible.  I've had it for a couple of years to backup my desktop pictures (about 200 gb).  It's connected to my network but the sofware is terrible.  I've had to now reload it on a new PC and I can't remember the password.  When you try "forgot password" you NEVER get an email response.  Even when I could connect to it their app is really cludgy.........not user friendly at all.  They really need to step up their game with their software to make it user friendly for Windows 10.
1,I had a My Cloud system and recently they sent out an update to the system. The new update made my system stop working and after I was told to send in my unit to an authorized data recovery center. I was told it would cost me $1500 to recover my 1TB of data.
5,I see a number of critical reviews for this product bemoaning the fact that it doesn't function as a traditional network storage device. No it does not. That's not necessarily a bad thing though! It has its own web-based system for adding accounts and setting permissions for files. This allows for easier access from mobile devices and is also easier for non-technical people to use (in my opinion at least). The name "My Cloud" is very descriptive in that the system behaves more like a cloud drive (Google Drive Dropbox etc.) than a traditional hard disk. Each user has their own distinct space to put files and nobody else can see them unless the owner explicitly shares them through the app. It's definitely different and I think it's pretty promising for my home-based use cases (largely sharing music and photos among family members). Time will tell!
1,What did I like about this product:Nothing.What did I dislike:Everything particularly the completely useless software designed for a demographic of what I presume to be lightly brain damaged eggplants.  The inability to locally manage anything forcing one to use the completely hackable cloud tool was especially awe inspiring in its breathtaking stupidity.What I use it for:It makes a nice paperweight.In parting:What a total piece of marketing shinola.  I guess to WD "home" means "completely friggin' braindead".Would never buy again will actively discourage others from purchasing ANY wasted digital products in the future.
4,I've written to wd support via email and no response. Trying to ask about apps for smart TV to stream files to.
1,Bought this thing to replace a Western Digital My Cloud Home Duo that broke down two less than two weeks after purchase. A slow and unreliable machine. PC app doesn’t work requiring running the app every time you start up your PC just for the machine to see the drive. Tech support is useless. Trying to upload data to this drive though WiFi Ethernet or USB is a ridiculously slow and frustrating process. iOS app web app are both faulty.
1,Understand there are specific conditions you must follow and specific type of WIFI for example to connect to the internet.The ads are misleading.  This is the second failure of a WD 6tb I've experienced.  At no time until this last failure did WD mention "conditions necessary to use".  Sure wish they would refund the wasted time I put in trying to get the 2 I've had work.
4,I don't like that I'm forced to leave a review in order to use the app.
1,The marketing and details from WD are very misleading for this product. DON'T be fooled. Thought I did my homework before purchasing and was still mislead. Even the software that WD has you install is all incompatible with the product. If you a simple NAS that you can access from a device outside your network this is for your. If you a looking a more and for a product that is supported by it's manufacturer look elsewhere.
1,DO NOT BUY this. Failed out of the blue after a couple years - well past the warranty so we know WD won’t do anything.  Check my router it’s got a good Ethernet signal.  What’s the problem.  According to WD “internal hardware error.”  Basically their version of GFY.  This is the second one that’s died on me and I’ll never willingly buy another WD product.
1,WD acts like this can be used as a Windows PC backup and they offer in the WD Discovery app software to use it as for backup. THIS WILL NOT WORK! If you are thinking about buying this as a network backup drive DO NOT buy it.This is also NOT a good device to use for Plex or Kodi. It certainly appears to be capable of those things but it is NOT. This device is an expensive fraud. Beware of this and by extension all WD devices.
1,I intended to use this product for the online storage of photographic shoots. I have 11 of the older WD My Cloud products which have been excellent for large scale storage of images. I bought an 8TB My Cloud Home and was sorely disappointed. You cannot just map a the public share and copy to it. I was copying about 150GB of files to the public share when an IO error was generated at random during the copy process. Rebooting (power off - power on) the My Cloud Home resulted in the device re-initializing it's self and erasing all the copied files. Tried this three times and returned the My Cloud Home.  It seems WD has discontinued the original My Cloud and replaced it with My Cloud Home. This is not a device you want to store valuable business or home data on. It may be a decent toy to link to your social media and smart phone but this is not what i need to use it for.
1,Every time I tried to set it up it caused my router to drop the signal THe Documentation is non-existant There's none available from Western Digital. I attempted to connect this thing for hours (Literally HOURS) . It's a boat anchor/brick as far as I'm concerned. This is not my first bad experience with western digital products. Look elsewhere for home cloud storage. I'm extremely disappointed but not surprised...
1,like many reviews that I should have listened to if you are accustomed to and like the old WD network drives you will hate this you can tell what the consumer wants by looking at the price of this piece of junk and the "older technology"  models are shooting up in price...guess WD doesn't carelook elsewhere stay away from this one
5,This works great no issues saves all the info I need pictures music videos and documents. I use it thru windows PC and thru phone to back up all my pictures it's connected to the router directly so no need to connect via USB as many complain here just map it as a local drive on your PC why use USB connection? Overall very happy with it if does what intended.Only bad thing software update on those hard drives takes few days over 5 years it happened twice and device was updating 4-5 days but after that it's always online 24/7
1,I originally had the WD My Cloud and decided to move to this new decice - I thought My Cloud Home was an upgrade of the other one; what a terrible mistake. The HD has less features than its original version and pretty much everything else is locked; even the “auto update”. You can’t disable lots of things you can’t use as a regular NAS (you need to install their software). After seceral months (or a year I dont recall using) my MAC runs super slow every time it tries to connect something similar is happening with Windows.I sont even bother calling Help Desk I know their solution: format the HD.I bought a Synology and is working perfect! I definitely dont suggest buying this My Cloud Home.
4,I used up the 4 TB very quick and loved it and when i had to reboot it a couple of times it was fast rebooting.
1,I had purchased the 4TB My Cloud drive. After two years it stopped working. The app would no longer connect and the drive was unresponsive. I had removed the LAN connection from my router to the drive and tried using USB cable to bypass the cloud feature and that didn't work either. Now I have a brick that needs to be thrown into the garbage. Up until that point it was working fine. I'm surprised that it only lasted two years and then died. I'll never buy another WD product again. Save your money and use another vendor.
1,There is NO way to back up files placed on this deviceThere is NO local web interface.  You must be connected to the internet to manage the limited device settingsThere are NO way to set permissions on files or create user accountsThere is NO way to map the device as a storage location without a piece of software from Western DigitalIt's like this thing was designed by a committee of failed marketing focus group looking for what those "millennials" want from a storage device and in the end determined; It's less about securely storing data and more about an "experience".  It's an experience alright...like a sloppy wet poo!Get an EX2 if you want an inexpensive NAS.
1,The only part of this drive that has value is the physical HD internal to the case.This drive crashes on my regularly showing "OFFLINE"I get random emails stating 'We have detected errors with your drive please click here for errors" only to be taken to their home page.  After chasing the options to click that are available NONE of them tell me what the error is.Is it a Physical Error?Is it a Firmware Error?is it Content corruption error?is there an error on the controller?Mix all that with the EXTREMELY POOR way to create shares and mapped drives and you have just a steaming pile of horrible ideas by a junior developer OK'd by a senior executive who knows nothing of how users of these devices will use it.The My Book Live was a better option and didn't give me a 64 character alphanumeric jumbled code as a Shared Folder called "Sarah" or "Jeff".  It was just mybooklive\Sarah or mybooklive\Jeff.  Easy.  Even Memorable...Avoid this drive and all of it's horrible user functionality that was wasted.
5,I really love the WD 6TB My Cloud Personal Home Cloud. It was extremely easy to set-up and use.Unboxing the My Cloud I plugged it in. I downloaded the app on my phone. It quickly connected to the My Cloud and I connected it to the internet and set it up. It took about five minutes.Recently my husband and I took a vacation and we each took a massive amount of photos. He used his smart phone I used a smart phone and a web connected digital camera.Once I put the app on both of our phones the My Cloud backed-up all of the photos and I had them all in a central storage.Using a photo sharing app I was able to download all of the photos and start editing them and creating albums that I could then share.At 6TB I'm pretty sure the My Cloud will last for years. Since I've only been using it for a short period it's really impossible to make any comments about how safe or secure it is. It has a double partition and reportedly saves a duplicate of everything in a second area so this would be a good safety feature.The ease of set-up and the ability to back-up multiple devices makes this a great addition to our house.
1,I recently opened my purchase from about a year ago to finally use. But after I figured out how to wiggle around having to have it on the internet to get stuff on drive. Which took hours upon hours. Then found could not use with devices like PS4 Roku and more. I needed it more for home cloud but sadly did that cannot work out. Also it locked me out several times. Which I then had to wipe and reload from a back source more than once..Because I thought "surely I was doing something wrong and misunderstanding the process of setting up or how to use it.. And as mentioned my local BB mostly only carries WD external and cloud drive options..thank got for honest reviews here. Because I thought it was me and I was going to buy a new one....
5,Works with Plex seamlessly.  I used to have to have a dedicated laptop with Plex open on it.  No more!  This is a standalone computerized server that’s always on.  Few caveats: this isn’t an external hard drive.  You cannot USB into a computer and drag and drop files unless you hack the thing with Linux and WD doesn’t like that.To put files on the server’s drives you can use the WD software or mobile app OR plug a usb thumb drive into its single port.  Then an option appears on the app or software to copy the drive contents to the server.  I don’t think you can copy single files but maybe there’s a way.  I just cleared out a portable drive and threw all my mp4s on it.
1,As stated in some other reviews this thing disconnects itself repeatedly.  The reconnect times have gotten longer and now it doesn't want to connect at all.Paperweight.  Except I don't work on paper anymore.Maybe I can wire it with Xmas lights and get SOME use out of it.
1,Tried this product for about 2 hours when I realized there is no local control. Windows can't even connect to it to perform backups. The software "required" is useless and provides absolutely zero control. All internet-dependent. Returning tomorrow and putting that money to the proper $250+ NAS I should have bought in the first place.
5,This was by far the easiest back-up system/wifi hard drive that I’ve ever installed. Simple. Stable. Affordable. Thank you so much Western Digital.Before anything know this is a simple back-up system meant for you home files pictures etc. This is not a NAS back-up system and frankly that might be a good thing if you are not an IT person. I get the thrill of a NAS system with your own IP but troubleshooting it can be an issue especially if you aren’t adept at it and I find that I have to constantly connect to those types of servers.This one is SIMPLE. It’s meant to replace iCloud or Dropbox. And you have a physical device. Look I love iCloud and Dropbox but what if something happens to those things? Say they get bought out or they change their TOS? I like control and this gives me control over my own digital files.It has auto-backup there is a desktop app and both were exceptionally easy to use and install. Once you sign-up with a login and password it will find your hard drive automatically once you get it initially set-up.Overall I’m very happy with this device.
5,If you are looking for an Amazing product I highly recommend Western Digital's My Cloud product line for your personal and small business data storage.
1,My device arrived in a factory-sealed box. I followed the instructions and plugged the unit into my router and power supply. I also tried inserting a pin in the rear of the unit to reset it. Nothing. It Just keeps B-L-I-N-K-I-N-G and B-L-I-N-K-I-N-G. I called WD support twice using a direct phone number I found on Get Human. The technicians walked me through the process of resetting the device. Unfortunately I spent my day doing this and it's still B-L-I-N-K-I-N-G with no end in sight. I'm going to see if a replacement will make a difference. I'll update this post when the new unit arrives.
1,This was advertised as an upgrade from the My Cloud range when in almost every way it's a straight downgrade. It doesn't support almost every single feature you would expect of a NAS and which were supported in the previous gen version. It doesn't support any sort of local access (meaning that if you lose internet you're without your data) it doesn't support SMB/FTP it doesn't support iTunes media server DLNA SSH. None of the features I have used successfully in the previous generation of this product work anymore.It can't even support quickly moving data from an older gen My Cloud to this product. I'm going to open it up remove the 8TB HDD buy a real NAS like a Synology and put the HDD inside it. WD My Clouds were cheap basic NAS devices that offered much of the functionality of mainstream NAS's while being integrated polished and affordable. This purchase has made me decide never to buy a WD product again.
1,This product is basically useless and worthless.I bought a MyCloud Home thinking it was an evolution of MyCloud. I have one since it was called My Book Live and it works amazingly well. No complains at all despite it being old...I felt made fool buying this. WD doesn't advertise it as being a ridiculously limited device which you can even setup shares and users properly no Dashboard SSH nothing. No real settings actually and to top it it requires an internet connection to workBasically it is intended for extremely basic users.To top it I couldn't find any information on installing any third party software on it to make it worth.As is the only reason not to return it is because I don't live in the US so I can't take it back and return it.I would be better off having purchased a RPI3+ and a powered external drive.
1,do not buy this product. has no customer support rare yet vdry needed updates. plex interface fails regularly.
5,This is a 6TB drive but if you want to do mirror backup then it is just two 3TB drives this was recommended incase one drive fails you will have the backup with the same files but if you opt to use the full 6TB and then drive fails then you lose everything. This was very simple to set up just plug into the router and plug in the power cord. I downloaded the app and it found this right away and I pressed the option to have it automatically save my pictures and videos from my phone whenever I am connected to wifi. I only could not backup my desktop files unless I plug it directly into this drive.
1,They have not perfected the product as what they had envisioned for the product to be.The setup was very straight forward and easy. However because they only allow files to be uploaded through the internet it took about half day or so to upload about 150GB of my data. What was terrible is that it didn't upload all my data and I actually had to download another software to compare the files that were in the cloud vs file that was in my computer. Turns out it was different and I lost trust altogether.I spent about 3 days re-doing the steps crossing my fingers hoping for the best.All in all I gave up and returned the product.
1,Worked well for two years. Then out of the blue I received an email “device cannot fix itself - contact customer support. Worst customer support ever. Still doesn’t work days after. Do not buy.
1,After much deliberation despite bad reviews I decided to purchase this device. The device will not set-up. After multiple calls with tech support they tell me to reset it and wait 30 minutes. I do then the same things happens. The device has to enter a “ready” state which may or may not happen with a new device and needs to be reset. Some devices I guess are just “paper-weights”(quote from tech support). I will be returning the product. Tech support offered to ship a new one which will take 7 days and I have to pay for shipping!!!! I just bought this thing yesterday! This thing is not user friendly tech support is no help. Overall GARBAGE product. TRUST THE REVIEWS.
1,WD customer service has no clue how their software works. After calling them multiple times because WD discovery was crashing on install their response was to wait until them came up with a solution. But they could never give a time frame for it. They offered to upgrade the drive but when they asked for my card information the amount they wanted to hold was more than the cost of the original drive. This company needs to treat their customers better. My advice is to buy anything else.
5,Works like it should.
1,Ever since the forced software change a few months ago files can only be shared with this device via a web browser or mobile app meaning it might as well be a cloud storage website. Also the mobile app is terrible and has pitiful functionality. You can't even download from the online storage to your device.
1,If all you're looking for is an extra drive for your computer this might work. But if you want a backup location for your for your backup software to write to this will absolutely disappoint. It has minimal functionality approaching cripple-ware. I'm so frustrated with this that I'm tempted to take it outside and bust it up with a hammer.
1,lacking user controlsYou can add users now however admin cannot view files only delete the account. (no mast account functionality)no password manager supportcannot login using a password manager. also website does not permit pasting password. so it MAKES you use insecure passwords.app sucksjust look at the app store reviews. it's awful. almost worthless.desktop app always has popupsevery time you log in to your computer the software has a notification pop-up or update pop-up. and you MUST install the software to use so there's no way around it.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Find something else for actual NAS or Cloud storage. I wish I would have just bought a time capsule. It does look nice though. and isn't too large in size.
1,And the WD My Cloud Home is getting returned. On first boot an "unknown error" (apparently because it immediately spends 15 minutes updating firmware but nothing indicates that) the Google Drive sync tool bombs out trying to load federation.mycloud.com (apparently a long-standing issue) and the fatal flaw: there’s NO WAY TO BACK IT UP. Literally. It has no built-in backup feature and because it’s not a mounted volume but rather just presented using this awful “WD Discovery” app there’s no drive to actually point other backup tools at. I’m going to put 4GB of data on a single spinning drive with no way to back it up?
1,If you are trying to access this on your network through your computer's explorer is isn't supported you have to use an online portal upload there and you can access you files that way very inconvenient
1,Purchased this from my local BestBuy. SAVE YOUR MONEY!The software that they built for it is absolute garbage and basically poorly coded shortcuts. The hard drive itself is absolutely god awful for transferring any type of large file takes forever.
5,Great. Love that you can connect multiple devices at a time.
1,if you can spell your own name do not buy this buy thw wd my cloud.... this thing sucks.... no dash board and won't let you manage it directly...
2,This is not a Network Attached Storage device you have ever seen. Do not confuse it with a standard NAS device. There is a glaring issue with these devices that WD obviously designed into it for some reason. The device must be connected to the Internet to work. That may sound reasonable - but there is no way to use it locally without internet access. I understand it is a "Cloud" device. I get it. However it would have been very simple to either include an ip address interface for advanced users or show a simple option when connected locally to turn off Internet Access. You get neither option - considering these type of devices are notorious for being hacked - I think an option to turn off internet access if desired should have been included. For example - if you are using this to stream movies family photos - whatever and tomorrow a security flaw is published that means your device is at risk - your only choice would be to turn if off. I really don't understand why they do give you the option like on other devices they make and sell.
1,Requires full time internet connection and a mycloud account.Requires 64-bit windows app to set up. Amazon fire tablets not supported. iPhone app might work but I can't tell because the phone can't run the app while it's being the internet connection via tethering.Very confusing instructions. Does it have a blue light or a white light? Some docs say both and some say white only. I cannot even tell if it's working as expected there's no admin page on the device.SMB transfers work but are extremely slow - ~2.5mB / secIt was a gift or I'd return it.
1,When experiencing device or software/firmware issues WD Support sometimes takes months to answer concerns or basically leaves it up to the community to resolve.  Look somewhere else.
1,WONT CONNECT TO MY IPHONE DID AT ONE POINT NOW IT WONT. CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS UNRESPONSIVE AT BEST.LOOK FOR ANOTHER SOLUTION WD CYCLOID IST IT
1,WD had abandoned Mac users.  With the latest OS and WD's software the drive won't even mount on a Mac system.  Find a different unit.
5,WD makes excellent drives and storage systems... but their software is always a bit behind. The WD MyCloud Home uses their MyCloud software which to their credit runs well on Macs and keeps certain folders in-sync just like Dropbox but in your own private cloud on your own network. MyCloud is better than the software used to manage most of their other drives it was super-easy to set up and ran faithfully until I accidentally bumped the drive on my desk and it fell over on it's side. The drive was lost at that point along with all the data stored there.
5,Very simple to use awesome storage device. Keeps all the photos and videos off my phone and computer without the fees. Eliminated bogging down on my Mac
1,This product is a piece of junk and WD does not back up their product.  Within one month after purchasing the power supply inside quit working making accessing the drive impossible.  Their tech support keeps sending instructions on how to wipe your personnel data from the drive that requires it to be on the internet.  Duh it has no power you dummies!  Needless to say I have purchased my last WD product as they cannot assure that my data cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.  Stay away stay away!
1,RUN AWAY!!!Absolutely dreadful product! Destroys photos I literally lost 10000+ photos which somehow got corrupted during the transfer process. Also you have to babysit the devices while it’s transferring files. What a total piece of garbage ;/
5,Need to upload LL Y PHOTOS FROM THE CLOUD. EASY TO DO ND GREAT. ALL MY OTHER CLOUDS ARE FULL
5,Love my Home Cloud!
1,The device is administered from the cloud which by definition means this is not a NAS device.
1,After almost 300.00 and 3 months later everything I had is gone and there is no answers and no support whatsoever!!!!!!!!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5,We were looking for a solution to replace our old system of a Mac Mini and connected hard drives that we used for a media library and a place to sync our iPhones.My husband set it up and had no problems. He's medium tech-savvy. I installed the necessary software on a Windows machine and voila. We've been able to update our iPhones and point our iTunes libraries and Apple TV to the My Cloud no problem.I see a lot of other reviews are pretty technologically specific and also seem to be expecting something from this that it just doesn't offer. For our simple needs - large enough to store music movies and photos easy to sync across multiple devices in our home this has been great.And my favorite part - it's really reliable. No crashing no offline time. It's connected to our router in the living room and sits there happily blinking away for whenever we need it.
1,Can’t use because of interruptions asking to rate the product
1,Typical WD  product piece of crap. Does not show on my network!!
5,First off setup:  I followed the card which had me connect to my router connect to power and have the light on the tower stay solid. This took less than a minute. The easiest external drive I have ever setup! I downloaded the app and created an account. I can choose what files to put on the cloud drive and what ones I don't. The bonus of this cloud is the user has control of the storage unit. I work with PCs and Mac products. I also have an android phone and an iPhone. Sharing files and photos is not always very simple as my Mac only wants to work with my iPhone. Now I can login in to this drive from anywhere and view anything from any device. Highly recommend this storage unit!  It works great and took no time to get it running. Only thing I would like is this to have a wifi option.
1,I am so sorry I bought this.  Thankfully I can return it.  I can't simply import my music from an old MyBook Live.  No local control.  No support.  I am comfortable with technology but this is just too difficult especially when it is marketed as a plug and play device.
1,Stop bugging me for reviews!
1,This thing is a garbage. DON'T LISTEN TO THE "REVIEWERS" GOT THIS AS A FREEBIE.Only having the basic functions? I do understand. WD want to sell expensive NAS yeah.But I get VERY slow file movement speed. The speed unit is KB/s not MB/s. This is a product can't even do a basic task well.All the data that moves around have to be transported through the AWS server which is bad for your privacy and you can't use this locally without using up all your internet data limit.
1,This product is NOT the same as the WD My Cloud NAS drives.  As a Mac user I was a very disappointed that this drive did NOT work with Apple's Time Machine.  WD My Cloud NAS drive DOES have support for Time Machine and it works fantastic.As for a product with same price WD has removed functionality which is a big disappointment and I hope they do reverse their decision on this product.  WD 8TB My Cloud Mirror Personal Network Attached Storage - NAS - WDBWVZ0080JWT-NESN
1,It's a private cloud storage. Not a NAS.You can just visit it on internet.If you have just a LAN you can't visit it without connecting to WD.
1,Listen...If you need a super basic give WD complete control of your drive and never think about it again kinda device this is perfect. If you want to change anything with it you cant. WD not only makes you create an account and use the device though that but they make it mandatory you use their software to access it. It is a bad design and makes the device horrible. I am returning mine. Buy the WD My Cloud original.  At least that is what I am doing.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!
1,Simply do not buy
5,Great product does what it is supposed to do!
1,SUCKS!!
1,Not a good product. If you have one just throw it away. If your internet service is down you can't get your files. If your home network is down you can't get your files. The worst.*Device is Ready *Firmware or Software Update in Progress and *Device does not boot is indicated by the SAME solid light. You never know.
5,I use this My Cloud to access documents pictures shared sites from my laptop iPad phone. Where ever I am. No personal information but book notes and pics.I can upload pictures screen shots documents from whatever I am on from where ever I am at.It has worked awesome. I have had issues with the android app.Overall great experience love it.
1,WD makes great hardware with lousy software and confusing and incomplete user instructions. The My Cloud Home is technical superior to its predecessor but the software is even worse and does not give the same possibilities as before. The server seems to work fine for mere storage of files in your network. However as media server it does not support the same functions as before and only seems to work with Plex. I prefer Infuse on Apple TV and iPad but the My Cloud Home did not connect. I shipped it back and ordered the previous generation My Cloud NAS. The previous generation has a higher price than the My Cloud Home another indication that there is something wrong with this new version.
5,Don't listen to all these reviews that basically say "OMG this device blows it can't even handle my 8K 3D VR Oculus movies!" If you want this for Plex then you're probably a regular 'ol pirate and I'm here to tell you it works flawlessly. Just don't try to get fancy and stream to 12 screens at once or try hooking up Plex to a black and white TV and then complain that your H265 video was not transcoded properly. If your screen can handle your video file natively then the My Cloud will stream a 10GB movie that you claim was merely ripped from a DVD that you own flawlessly. Trust me.
1,Cloud functionality is interesting / helpful but the constant indexing makes uploads incredibly slow. Like dial-up internet slow. Not a viable replacement for my old NAS device (as I hoped it would be).
1,This is a worthless piece of crap.  It comes with no instructions and if you call support you are connected to a obviously foreign representative with a thick accent.  I'm sending it back now.  Very sad.
1,Worked great for about 18 Months and then it just died. I had the 4 TB. The unit will not power on. I brought it to Best buy and they could not fix it. The hard drive still worked but the case would not power on. I removed the hard drive but without the case I could not access the data.
1,They used to have the regular My Cloud line that worked like a normal NAS. This one gives you almost no control over setting up static IP’s or using it as anything other than a backup (which it has to remain connected to the internet to even use.) I was hoping to expand Plex storage with other drive but this is not it.Bring back the old line WD and stop assuming everyone wants a totally simple stupid device.
1,Did not read the reviews and I was under the impression that the product can be used as local NAS as well but seems that without internet connection this is piece of useless hardware. For advanced usage you will need to root the device ( and lose the warinty) ..
1,Software sucksDownloads duplicate files
5,It has enabled me to archive all of my personal photos videos documents tax info and my business documents in a most effective manner.
1,stay well away from this. It will break your heart.
1,It doesn't take long before this device stops working altogether and your account with Western Digital is wiped out as well so you can't even sign in to get online support. I put a ton of time into this thing and stored a lot of critical data just to have it rendered useless.
5,Storage easy to set up home usage
1,Bought for backup storage and remote access.  Totally useless for backups.  Documentation provided is poorly written and misleading.DO NOT BUY
1,Back Up software wouldn't load.  Other software wouldn;t update.  Don't waste your time or money
1,do not buy. Spend a little more and get a 1bay from QNAP or literally any other manufacturer and put it together yourself. first generation WD Mycloud were basic but had good functionality and reliability. These new ones are a nightmare of incompatibility and difficulty of operation. I wouldn't buy this drive if it cost $40. I'm serious. get anything ANYTHING else
5,I just got it set up but so far it’s working great. I have a long way to go with it so I may change my opinion down the road but so far it’s the easiest digital storage device I have ever used. I haven’t needed to call for tech support and both the app and the web interface are very user friendly.
1,İts working really bad.
1,Worthless.  You can’t even power it down without using the mobile app. Never WD again.
1,First con: the thing comes with almost nothing in the way of instructionsSecond con: once you hunt down the on line guidance you have to know a lot to get it to actually workThird con: if you need help don't bother emailing tech support.After that - I gave up.
5,It’s a great file server cloud
1,This product should be set to EOL as it gives WD a bad reputation with very poor device management software and no local LAN management or use features.  I recommend taking the drive and throwing the rest away.
1,Installation was easy. My Cloud drive showed up right away with a drive letter in This PC in Windows 10. It does not appear on the network as a regular NAS drive.File copying was terribly slow. I gave up trying to copy my 2.5 TB of data after 5 days. Dragging multiple folders to copy would crash it so I was trying to copy one folder at a time. I definitely would NOT recommend due to terrible transfer speed.
1,Its only a hard drive with Ethernet port. No NAS fatures no local management. Cannot be used as a media server.
1,You can only download individual files so if you want to keep a backup of say your music collection you would have to download each individual song. If you have a large music collection that is impossible. Western Digital is misleading their customers.
1,Sorry - this does not function as a network storage device.  The drive could not be accessed from my network and web connection denied access to the account set up from the my cloud app.  Wasted an hour of my time.
5,I have FIOS internet that this personal cloud device is able to access at all times so I am not having the problems with local access that some of the other uses have stated.  Also being a really non-tech person I was happy that I was able to set this up myself in minutes.  The unit does depend on an app provided by Western Digital so I too am a bit worried about longevity in that if WD decides to discontinue this product I may be left scrambling to find another backup system'All in all it meets my personal computing needs at this time and I am satisfied with its performance.  I have any extra WD Personal Cloud Unit that I use as a backup to this backup system however.
5,This is so easy to use. Just plug it into your router download the app from WD and start using it. You can use any browser but I recommend using the app. In my mac I downloaded the desktop app and shows the storage mapped you can open files move them drag and drop them.
5,We are loving the Cloud Duo! It was incredibly easy to set up it has been incredibly easy to get data from all the different places we have it (dropbox facebook google drives mobile devices and our computers). It is nice knowing that not only is our data backed up once but twice. We have had no issues using it with both apple and android as well as mac and windows based laptops!This is a great product especially for those who take lots of photos and need the back up of the back up!
1,Do not buy. This is not NAS. Does not enable transfer of data across a Windows network on anything other than a public partition. Total crap will be returning. Thanks for nothing.
5,Terrific back up for when you save things ( as you should ) - particularly photo's and video. Nice looking professional/home pro look. Pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it. I have been using/trusting  this one as I refine  a pilot for a snarky web-based series. Knowing that I have a back-up ( or two really) is huge.This brand is used in my office too.  At first I thought it might be too complex to set up or use. Not the case. I had one occasion to contact customer service- answered in roughly 30 seconds with a quick-fix!  Remarkable!Not for everyone but few would find fault with this.  So easy intuitive to use.
1,Installation took 5 hours. Now it will not run a backup. I will be returning this misfit toy back to the bad elves at WD.
5,My laptop was slowly dying.  A friend was able to pull all pictures and documents off of my laptop before it died completely- so happy with purchase.
5,I like knowing I can continue to use My Cloud and do not need to receive notices from I Cloud to pay more for using more storage.
5,Excelente equipo es como tener tu propio servidor en casa para almacenamiento y compartir archivos desde cualquier parte en la que te encuentres
5,Let me start with saying this is a fantastic "HOME" storage device for those looking for something simple that will save anyone in your family data from their phones computers.  It is very simple to setup and it works great for the use mentioned.  No it is not a Network Storage Systems and it does require an internet connection.  If you can get past this this unit works well.  Simple fast and safe.  I really like it.
1,So far not so good. I received the unit weeks ago that came with what is apparently an inaccurate code to connect. After emailing WD tech support I still have yet to receive an answer so there it sits 4TB of a dusty paperweight. It has an IP address and is very very much online but the web site is unable to find it. I have a second single drive unit I'm looking to review in the near future but I'd prefer this one were up to par first.
5,The initial set up is extremely easy. Plug it in and connect to your wifi router and it's up and running. The next step is to download the app and get connected. Also quite easy. Final step - learning the software that allows you copy and backup. This is usually the step that is most tedious complicated and hard to figure out. Fortunately in this instance it's pretty straightforward. The first 2 steps take less than 5 minutes the last takes closer to 20 minutes. Overall not very complex or time consuming.
5,Love it! Backs up my photos everyday without me doing anything and that’s just a fraction of its function.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I like the storage capacity I also like the fact that WD has a good product as far as drives but for some reason they cannot get their iCloud system working correctly. This is the second type of iCloud storage hard drive I have purchased in this brand they now have both failed on me with no way to recover information. I used it for back up on my photos but now it seems that I have lost that back up. I called customer service and they told me that they were doing maintenance to the system today I looked again and it still did not work so I went to their site  and see that they have a message there was a security breach or something that caused her system to fail so now I am stuck with another paperweight and this one was about 3 to 4 TB so you could imagine that this paper weight was pretty costly. At this point I believe I am done with this brand  unfortunately I am seeing that they also own other drive brands so now I am concerned with getting another brand that may be tied into this one. Just be warned there are two different versions of the drives they have now failed on me. also customer service now is nonexistent.
5,Great storage
5,this is great to have your own cloud and not rely on google and other
5,This was perfect for transferring all of my desktop files to my new laptop
5,Great produce and the app makes storage maintenance seamless!
5,Automatic back-up was a life saver! Lost phone but had all my photos saved!
5,My Cloud was very easy to set up. Just connected to the network and installed the software. Files transfer speed is excellent it took less than a minute to transfer 1.57 GB file. Had transfer speeds averaging 55 mb/s consistently in an office setting. Overall we haven’t had any issues and it's working great.
5,Love it pretty easy to setup. I am using it with ios and android no problems so far.
5,So far this is the best!!
5,I have trouble storing my camera pictures to the mycloud...therefore taking up storage space on phone because I'm afraid to delete them.
5,Back up storage for devices from anywhere
5,Great product
5,I wanted to consolidate all my digital info into one place specially since I’ve been paying extra to have cloud storage. This works perfectly and seamlessly between my laptop ipad and iPhone. Hopefully I have better luck as the last storage 1tb from this company I had crashed after slowing down my computer for a while. With this one it seems ok and i will update my review if anything changes dramatically in the future.
5,Easy to upload my data
5,Really great NAS! Has worked perfectly since I got it. Very easy to set up.
5,I can't imagine ever filling this thing up with photos and other data. Setup was a breeze with the easy-to-follow instructions. I really like being able to access my archived photos remotely - it's almost like having a 3TB iPhone. It's made it possible for me to archive all of my iPhone photos and then delete them from the phone freeing up several GB of memory and making the phone work better.
5,Almacenó todo y ya no me preocupo por que se pierdan mis archivos
5,I have to assume it’s on because there isn’t  any light source to suggest it is working.  Also be cautious if you’re shopping for one with an Ethernet connection as this one doesn’t - it’s just usb. I thought this did but it doesn’t so I ordered another.  Ain’t gonna kill me to have another backup drive.
5,Easy to install
2,===================== Update =============================================I am revising my comment about the Alexa My Cloud Skill. If I hear Alexa say one more time that it didn't hear my request or can not find an artist or album that I know is in My Cloud I think I'll throw something! (Just kidding--sort of!) Honestly the My Cloud Skill is like much else in the WD My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage system--half baked and not yet ready for prime time. I'll be overjoyed when WD gets all the pieces in place and working properly.  ******************************** Original Review ************************************The WD My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage has some interesting features and carries with it some significant concerns. First the concerns:* Storage - Despite the drive size stated in the title in RAID-1 mode the total storage is not 12TB with this model. It's 6 TB because each drive is mirroring (copying) the same files from the other. It's how RAID-1 works. However if redundancy is not that important to you (I'm not sure why it wouldn't be) you can put the device in Full Capacity Mode and enjoy all 12TB or whatever size Duo that you purchased.* Backups - There aren't any backup provisions--a least not yet. The misleading USB 3 connectors located on the back of the drive are for uploading data to the drive not the other way around. This is a major oversight by WD. Even RAID systems can suffer catastrophic failures. No one should know this better than WD--they sell a ton of RAID-based solutions. They should have included some method to back up the WD 12TB My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage to an external location. There is no question that 6 or 12TB is a significant amount of data to lose and although the drive likely won't be full for some time if ever it's still risky to trust your data to nothing more than a pair of redundant drives and luck.* Security - The WD My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage has to be connected full time to the Internet. This creates a degree of security risk for your data. It also represents a potential backdoor that may allow your network and its devices to be compromised. (For safety's sake I put a hardware firewall between the device and my home office network.) However WD needs to find a way to better protect the device itself and your network.* May Western Digital live long and prosper. (Apologizes to Mr. Spock.) They not you are in charge of the WD My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage. Your function is as the administrator but they actually operate the device. Should they ever decide that this service is something that they no longer wish to continue supporting users could very well be left hanging. It's something to consider.* Individual users exist in their own protected partitions. This is both good and bad. It is good as gives each user some degree of privacy and security. However it is also bad as it blocks the administrator from seeing what nasty things users may be placing in their partitions. (Never trust users!)* Playing music is non-intuitive. The My Cloud app (Android or iOS--no version is available for Amazon's Fire Tablets) can see the music files but it can't play them. The included Plex server is limited and fairly useless unless you buy a subscription to their service.* Some video and audio file types don't play at all except on a PC or Mac that sees the device as attached storage.* The device can not be accessed at all from a Mac or a PC unless the WD Discovery application is running. It's yet another thing that may chew up your computer's precious resources.* Despite stating that a swipe down will do this the iOS app doesn't update. It has to be closed and reopened to show new or changed files.WD's Product's Manager claims that he spent two years working on the My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage product line. I won't dispute his statement. However to me the product feels like it was rushed out the door.Those are my concerns. As you can see there are more than a few of them. But what do we actually have in the WD My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage? As other reviewers have pointed out and as is stated in the product's name this is a personal cloud device. This can't be considered to act as local Network Attached Storage (NAS.) They are not the same thing. Essentially you have your own cloud storage system that can replace (in some ways) or more likely augment commercial cloud services such as Dropbox Google Cloud Storage and Amazon Drive.My purpose in using the WD 12TB My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage was to create on-line cloud storage for my photos music and video files. I wanted to allow sharing of these media files with my wife and my adult children (who no longer live at home.) So how did I fare with this endeavor?My first experience was disturbing. Typing in the mycloud address as given in the "Hello" card included in the box took me immediately to a phishing web site that completely took over my web browser. Whether someone had hijacked the mycloud domain or if simply mistyped the address it was a frightening experience that jarred me. To be safe I scanned the PC and then went directly to the WD website. I downloaded software and set up the device from there.WD requires users to create a free account. Creating an account  requires creating a password but the password is never shown and isn't repeated for confirmation. This is very sloppy programming as a typo in the password can really mess things up when you log in. However once I had created an account the WD web site found my device immediately. I then enabled the Alexa My Cloud Skill. It was a simple process it worked immediately and quite well. Alexa by voice request could find and play songs by artist album or title but only MP3s would play. (That maybe more of an Echo limitation than a limitation in the My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage device.)Despite WD's attempt to make the My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage act like an appliance there is a learning curve associated with using the product. This process is made even more cumbersome by a difficult limiting and non-intuitive web and app interface. It just doesn't act like it might be expected to act. Clearly WD has some work ahead of it with what seems very much like a version 1 product. However if they read our reviews listen to their customers and do the work they might have something really special in the My Cloud Home Duo Personal Cloud Storage. It's just not there yet.
5,The Network attached storage device. Preforms the dedicated task of saving your valuable information from your mobile devices. Right before you lose everything during the crash of your internet devices and the setting up process is extremely super easy and fast
5,Love it!
5,Simple to set up and use.  I should point out the size listed could be misleading as the device comes with two 3 GB drives.  I tis set up so that they are redundant in case 1 fails so you have about 3 GB of usable space not 6.  I'm not sure if you can turn that feature off so you can have 6 GB but without the failure protection.
5,Works great
5,I hate paying for cloud storage but am ultra paranoid that I am going to lose family photos or something.  So I store everything in multiple places.  This cloud is perfect for me - I get to keep some control and monitor it at my house!Tons of storage capacity and easy to use and set up!
5,I like the fast shipping
5,Perfect for a family full of phones tablets computers etc. Back them all up on this and never lose any of your information. Easy to set up and use.
5,Love love love this worth every penny. Note that it has a different website address than their previous cloud products.
3,12/12/2017 5:45pm EST update:My WD 4TB Cloud Home Duo decided to not sync any longer with Plex. I di d narrow this issue down to this cloud server since my other NAS's are running stable using my same Plex account.I repeated a full reset I had done in the past (for this review) and now this WD will no longer connect to my Network no matter if I reset i my router or try to remove all cookies (they are installed in your browser when setting up) yet my other 3 NAS's are all running ok on Plex.The full reset should allow a factory reset in which you initiate setup as when this WD came out of the box and this is ot the case.The full reset which worked fine when I tried it for the review no longer works. The WD is not connectible.Nothing in my network has changed....I even tried to connect t this WD using alternate browsers (mycloud.com/hello).No dice.3 Stars for now until I figure out why this WD Cloud-only drive is now unwilling to connect at all.I've never had to fight ith my NAS's at all.....smooth sailing....but this WD model is certainly a challenge!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------I own 3 NAS’s here. Two are made by WD and one is a Synology. These include both 2 and 4 bay NAS's.One is dedicated to Time-Machine Backups another for Media/Movies photos and Music and a third smaller capacity one for additional videos/movie files that have been converted to smaller sizes to be viewed on a temporary basis and then deleted and for general testing for playback and quality checks.The WD My Home Duo is Not a full NAS …not even close…...you can access it directly similar to a networked device only by using the app you download from WD.It does not have its own web site using its IP address. As one reviewer said you can just enter and access it as a NAS would by entering its IPS address on your browser.You can NOT access it similar to a NAS.. directly from you network (circumventing an internet connection  (remote access) )  using the free WD app you dl and install on your mac or pc. Once opened on a Mac it shows on the sidebar in finder like an attached drive.You can also access it through an internet connection using the WD website (mycloud.com/hello) and your account that will be far slower for uploads then direct  access within your networkBut full local access within your network is not at all like a full blow NAS that needs n app to be accessed as a server on your network.My NASs all are right there as external (networked) servers/drives....just log in as a guest or administrator and they are there to access and read and write.This WD Cloud only drive is quite a bit clunkier to access. If you've never used a NAS then you probably would not have any compasrisons and be quite satisfied with the WD Cloud Home Duo.By the way the product page descries the model I reviewed here as a 4TB mirrored raid drive. Misleading.....what you get is actually TWO 2TB drives that are mirrored. Raid 1 mirrored decreases the total capacity of your pair of drives by 50%. Technically the 5TB Raid 1 unit here should be really described as a "2X2TB Raid 1 Cloud storage" drive to clarify what you are really getting for hard drives inside of it!.The Amazon product page wording is a bit "misleading".I found accessing it by internet rather then using the app and within my network was about 10X slower to upload files to the WD. That’s normal considering most upload speeds for ISPs are much slower then directly through an ethernet or slower wifi link.Also for internet access without using the app there is a file size limit. I am not certain the specific value for limit but suffice to say a high deg 12GB file refused to upload using internet access but uploaded fine and at a fast speed upon using the WD ap to access the WD locally on my networkSo the no-brainer here is to always use the WD app at home (connected to your network) and of course when away from your network you are stuck with an internet access connection only resulting in slower performance and reduced file size uploading.  (file size inits might be set in your ISPs protocol as well).This WD also supports backup protocols for both Mac (TimeMachine) and PCs. I did not test it butassume like the other features I did use … you can backup on your network locally or while away from it using your WD account and an internet connection.Effectively you could back up while away from home or even do a restore in the event it is needed. The only factor which may be a concern is connection speed which is going to be typically slower using an internet access then doing a wifi or wired network connection within you own network. A large backup or restore might take a long while to finish using the WD as the backup point while away from your network.This Non-NAS Cloud storage device also supports Plex for allowing streaming from the WD over the internet to a designed device. I found it quite easy to setup the WD with my Plex account and drag and dropped movies into the “Movies” folder on the WD. Once logged in to your Plex account it will “see” your Plex Cloud WD and begin to install media data and thumbnails of the movie.While you can “Share” your folders with anyone by inviting them through an email using the WD My Home Duo I did not see any means to designate a way to not share a specific folder. …meaning if you share with someone they will have full access to all of your folders on the My HOME.The setup menu is very sparse as is available apps. There are hardly any there available to download. I see no option to shop for apps through WDs site or directly on this WD Cloud device.There is no sleep option no means to turn off the think slit of White light around the outer case (it can show the status of this unit by being on steady or blinking) which is a small strip in the body along the outer case on this WD and I do not see any manual means of checking or installed firmware updates. There is no options to check the device for temperature or anything to do with diagnostics. Compared to my other NAS’s which come at about the same price this WD lacks much user control or administration. My other NAS’s have all of this and have far more in-depth menus for the user/owner/administrator then this WD has.The two hard drives in this unit (Two 4 TB) are easily removable and replaceable. You could increase the size of the hard drives as well as long as you use two matched/identical hard drive is maintaining a Raid 1 configuration.Pop the top cover form the back and it easily snaps off. Depress the button for the hard drive slide it up and out and remove the tracks on each side. Reverse to use another hard drive.The model I have comes with TWO 4 TB drives set in a road 1 (mirrored to each other)  so i one drive malfunctions the other still has all of your data. This WD also allows changing to JBOD configuration in which each drive stands alone (not mirrored) and while you do not have mirrored protection you get the benefit of having 8 TBs of storage.I use Raid 1 for all critical storage. If you plan to use this WD as a storage point that is backed up elsewhere JBOD is fine otherwise sacrifice  capacity for peace of mind and keep it in Raid 1 as it is set up out of the box!I also tested the reset function. The back of this Cloud drive has a tiny hole used to reset (using a paper clip) this device. The reset functions vary based on how long the button is held down so be sure to read the full on-line pdf manual available at the WD web site. You can do a minor reset if issues arise all the way up to a full reset erase and return to factory setup.As for uploading files it is a slow process as I said above. Uploading a 1.65 GB video file took close to 5 minutes. I also found the WD and supporting cloud web site refused to accept a high Def file that was about 12 GB in size. I am not sure what the cap is for file size but unlike my other  NAS’s that handle any file size at all this WF and the WD Cloud web site do not cooperate as well for larger file sizes.  I have yet to keep testing file uploads to see what the limit is but it is there so there is a limitation for file sizes for this cloud drive.We have 135+ mbps download and 6 mbps upload speeds here and considering you’ll be uploading a lot to this Cloud drive to get files there upload speeds are the biggest concern over-all as files will take time even with a fast connection.My NAS’s which are all on a wired ethernet network run far faster for access both up and downloads due to a non-internet means of using them.While I did not notice any buffering on a test movie view using the cloud which was directly over my network) on my Samsung TV (Samsung and others manufacturers have the Plex app for free download and installation) …your mileage will vary based for performance based on your setup. prevailing internet connection quality and speeds and other factors in the entire chain from the WD Duo to your receiving/viewing device through the internet chain servers and back down to your iCloud Duo Home device and internet connection.The only glitch I had to set up PLEX was the need to enter the ip address manually of the WD so PLEX could access it for streaming. Bt default PLEX was trying to access the wrong port address of the WD and once I out it in manually less the additional port values the default installation was attempting to do there were the movies with thumbnails from  my WD  content; all within the PLEX folder the WD had after configuring PLEX on it.As a PLEX cloud (internet access only) streaming device this would do well for that if you have a decent internet connection and over-all setup and it was easy to install and set up PLEX on the WD Cloud Home duo as well  as my other viewing devices.Considering this Cloud storage device has full ethernet/internet capability WD most likely could have added network capability to is and given it a local ip address to be acceded internally on your own network.So in summary I am giving this Home Duo Cloud dual-drive an averaged over-all 4 star rating.  3 Stars for it’s limitations on available apps minimal options functions and features that a NAS drive would typically have (at a similar cost) and 5 stars for what seems to be stable performance  although that comes with a slower transfer speed when using internet only cloud drive access that is working outside of a home network and thus is very dependent on your bandwidth what other devices are using your modem and internet and presumably how the servers you go through and the WD web-site are performing at the time of use.I am thinking this WD could have additional features added through firmware upgrades.Suffice to say that as it comes out of the box you do have both network access using the WD app (and only through this app) and internet access as well when you are away from your network
2,PROS:2 tb storageAttractive casingLong power cordComes withiPhone app is servicableUSB port to connect extertnal storage for direct uploadCONS:Abysmal customer supportBare bones start up card/no physical documentation or common troubleshooting guide with the deviceDownloadable manual does not address troubleshooting in WindowsNo USB connection to tether drive to a computer (USB connector is to port information from external drives only)Very very difficult/frustrating to install on Windows--needed to upgrade windows to install drivers properly--even with the upgrade I had to use the older version of the software otherwise the drivers remained 'unsigned' and unaccepted by Windows 10--all this required multiple installs/uninstalls--very very frustratingBundled software NOT compatible with cloud drive/No software to add value to Cloud DriveNon-encrypted storageNo native Chromebook appSlow upload/transfer speeds even with a fast connectionOVERVIEW:I was really forward to receiving this drive for review purposes and was very sorely disappointed. To whit the drive was very difficult to install on my Windows 10 computer the install on the mac required some extra steps not described after installing the software and customer support is virtually non existent.I do have the drive up and running and even now the 'bundled' software only works for hard drives with a direct USB connection. It does not work with the Cloud Drive and there is NO WAY to connect this hard drive to your computer without upgrading.I am not well versed in what is available out there but Seagate has some options and I would start by looking at their drive. Given all the troubles I had installing this drive on Windows using this drive was more like beta testing than buying. It is not yet ready for prime time.COMPLETE REVIEWUNBOXING:Couldn't be simpler: inside the box is the hard drive a start card a power cable and an ethernet cable. That's it. The drive is rather attractive with a white top with the WD logo a silver bottom with a diamond-like pattern and all teh ports located on the back. Between the white and silver is a glowing LED strip. On the back of the drive you will find a USB port the ethernet port and a power cable.The USB port is a standard USB 3.0 female port used to connect external drives (e.g. thumb drives or other hard drives) so that you can port information to your cloud drive. There is no on/off switch nor is there a USB connection that can be used to physically connect the MyCloud drive to your computer.SET UP:Physical set up was easy. You basically connect the drive to power and connect the ether net cable from the MyCloud. The led will pulsate and then glow solidly once the device is attached to the internet.Per the instructions you then go to your computer connect to the Wi-Fi network that your device is on and go to the mycloud hello siteAnd in my experience that is when all hell breaks loose.You basically choose your device My Cloud Home in this case and set up an account. Initially you type in your device's serial number and in theory you should be good to go. Sadly for me this was not so...I was able to create an online account and the app worked on my iPhone and Mac but installation on Windows was a bear.MAC:Basically you download and run the software. The drive will be in the finder. Note however that each time you restart your mac you have to make sure the WD Discovery software is running and sign in or you won't see the My Cloud drive.iPHONE APP:No problems here. However there is only basic functionality: you cannot back up your entire iPhone to the My Cloud drive only photos and videos. You do have access to view items backed up from other devices--such as Word or PPT files. However these files have to be opened in their native iPhone app. You can read the file but if you edit it there is no way to save it back to My Cloud. Saving in Word or PPT you can opt to sae to many locations but My Cloud is not on the list. This was not well though out at all especially if you are using an iPad or iPad Pro for productivity on the go....You are able to invite users to use the drive but not much more than that.ONLINE BROWSER PORTAL:After logging on you can see everything that is on the drive and can actually upload files to the drive.Unfortunately you can only view photos and see some videos via the online portal. For example an mov file shot on my iPhone had to be downloaded to play the video on the browser. However an MP4 video would play natively on the online portal. Documents however have to be downloaded and opened on your computer (for example Word or PowerPoint files). This limits the use of this portal on a computer with limited memory ability (such as a Chromebook).SEVERE PROBLEMS INSTALLING WD DISCOVERY SOFTWARE IN WINDOWS:I downloaded the WD Discovery software and it would NOT recognize the drive. I could not figure out why so I uninstalled the software and tried again. (What's frustrating is that you need to restart Windows after installing and unintstalling the software. Every time. Keep this in mind as I go through the trouble shooting saga below....)As it turns out installation resulted in to driver loading errors: the Western Digital VFS Driver and Virtual PnP Bus Drivers were rejected by Windows 10 as 'Windows requires a digitally signed driver.'So at this point I could see my drive if I looked in File Explorer under 'Network' but it only showed up as a computer icon and when you clicked on it it revealed a folder that was labeled 'Public.' It did not register as a disk drive under desktop...After some endless fishing around on the WD Help Site I finally found the page with the 'answer.' \This gave me three options in the following order:1) update to Windows 10 OS build 16299.xxx (you can find your version by clicking on the Windows Start Button-->clicking the gear thing to get to the control panel-->clicking on System-->scrolling down and clicking on 'About' on the left hand menu. Then scroll down to windows specifications and it will tell you your Windows Edition Version and OS Build.)2) Disable secure boot or contact my local IT service department3) Uninstall WD discovery version 2.1.371 and install version 2.1.322 from the support.wdc.com downloads site(I was particularly enamored of the advice to contact my local IT service department. This is a My Cloud HOME. At HOME I AM the IT service department. That's why this thing is supposed to work right out of the box...)First and foremost this answer was updated on 12/23/2017. That means that this is a KNOWN issue. What has WD been doing during this time and why have they not fixed this issue? Did they not get the memo from Microsoft? The whole idea of having installation software is to FIX these kinds of errors automatically. In the event that said software cannot do that it should at very least walk you through the process or point you in the right direction. No such luck from WD.So I updated Windows. Not sure why this was not already done as I've opted in for automatic Windows updates but--what the hey--it needed to be done so half an hour later (as all things go with major Windows updates) I was up and running with Windows 10 OS build 16299.192).No go. Uninstalled WD Discovery software/restarted Reinstalled WD Discovery software/restarted. Same freakin' unsigned driver messages. (Started wishing there was a way to directly install the two drivers rather than having to install and reinstall the WD Discovery bundle which also takes quite some time to install...)On to step two. Followed the Microsoft instructions on disabling Secure Boot (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/disabling-secure-boot). Not being a computer genius I have no idea whether this makes my computer vulnerable to anything but I was game.Still no go. Uninstalled WD Discovery software/restarted. Reinstalled WD Discovery software... SAME driver error. Restarted. Still no go.Really ticked off I started on option #3. I uninstalled the new version of WD Discovery--rinse/wash/repeat--and reinstalled the old version and restarted. No driver errors but still no go. I restarted again. Nothing.At this point I wrote a detailed email to the company outlining exactly what you see above: that the drive worked on my iMac and iPhone but was a no-go on Windows. No response in 48 hours. (See below)While I was waiting I installed WD Access--not sure this was necessary but I did it. And uninstalled and reinstalled the old version of the WD Discovery software. Finally it showed up as a disk drive. Not sure if WD Access was necessary to get it to work but now it does....SUPPORT (OR LACK THEREOF)There is no online chat support at WD. I tried to find the phone number of their support services but kept getting bounced to their WD Community Boards or email support. This is why I opted for email support. In spite of the DETAILED rundown of the problems and my ALL my attempts at trouble shooting up to that point I was gobsmacked by the response.It took 4-5 days before I got a response from WD support. By then of course I already had the drive up and running. I am reprinting their response as I have a really hard time believing they even bothered to read my query.  And what was there response.  In a nutshell they told me to: 1) make sure that one end of my ethernet cable was plugged into my drive and my router; 2) make sure the power adapter was plugged in and the light bar glowed solid white; 3) make sure my mobile device was connected to the same network as the My Cloud Home and go to the 'hello' page.Sound familiar?  Yup.  It's the bare bones start up card. AAARRRGGGHHH!!!!! You can't make this stuff up. Ummm... if the thing was working with my smartphone and my iMac I think it was plugged in correctly...  I've fallen and I can't get up....BUNDLED SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK:My Cloud comes with bundled apps. These include: WD Backup WD Drive Utilities and WD Security. But don't get too excited--these apps ONLY work with USB-connected WD drives. You can use the WD Backup utility to back up to your DropBox account but it WILL NOT WORK with your My Cloud drive. Why?  As noted above you CANNOT connect your My Cloud drive to your computer directly so there is no way to take advantage of this software.Why they included these products in the WD Discovery app for the My Cloud drive remains a mystery. It is likely just another sloppy move by WD who use these apps for all of their drives.  But including software that only works for their other products is pretty much a slap in the face to their My Cloud Home buyers.Even worse the other listed software options (Adobe Creative Cloud Upthere Home Plex Acronis True Image ESET Drive Security Blancco Magisto digi.me and EncryptStick) are really just links to buy software or services. These companies do not even give a promotional price or free use period to owners of the My Cloud Drive: they are basically just advertisements for cloud services that bloat up the WD Discovery software.You can download a stripped down version of Acronis True Image from WD downloads (but not the My Cloud app). (NOTE: This may only have worked on my computer because I have a Sandisk thumbdrive attached to my computer and this version will work with Sandisk products as well.) I was able to get it to initiate a back up of my computer to the cloud drive but I aborted it as this version does not appear to create encrypted back ups. For this you would have to pay for an upgrade.ENCRYPTION:The My Cloud drive is password protected but not encrypted--at least as far as I can tell. This poses a problem when it comes to using it for full backups of your computer or any kinds of sensitive data.Videos images documents without private information etc. might work for this. But as WD doesn't give you any security softare for the drive and the drive itself is unencrypted I would NOT advise using this as a back up for any kinds of sensitive documents. Identity thieves will just be one password away from cracking the drive and getting at its contents.MISSING CHROMEBOOK APPFirst and foremost there is NO app for Chromebooks. I really can't understand why they have not made a Chromebook app for this drive.Chromebooks are becoming more and more popular and are notorious for lack of extensive on board storage. Sure you could use your Google Drive but having a shared disk like this makes a lot of sense especially if you are using a Chromebook and want to share files/data with others.You can access the information via the web browser portal on a Chromebook but in order to view anything other than pictures on the web browser portal you have to download the file to your computer before opening it making this far less useful for owners of Chromebooks...CONCLUSION:I am very disappointed in the My Cloud Home drive. The device has a lot of potential but WD is going to have to make it easier to set up in Windows and boost the sharing capacity of the drive. Right now I feel as though I am beta testing this drive for WD.Their Windows set up software needs to be fixed in order to make this useful for the average user (who will not spend hours on end installing/reinstalling and trying to find and troubleshoot this device). They need to upgrade the WD Back Up Drive Utilities and Security software to work with the My Cloud device--this is a major major flaw here. Software that adds value makes the drive more useful than just being a repository for information. Especially in the security department where a cloud-connected drive is more vulnerable to attack.I am very very disappointed in WD's lack of support for this product. It is very frustrating that they have not corrected known software issues and have not made this easily accessible on their website. The major problem here is that the product as it stands is not plug an play. It also has limited functionality and the company does not supply any added software to enhance value here as they do with their traditional USB-connected hard drives.Based on my experience I cannot recommend this drive. I would recommend looking into competitors such as Seagate before purchasing a network drive. Security wise this would not be a great option for the home user who does not have a built in network firewall or does not know how to encrypt data when uploading to the drive.
5,I bought this drive to connect multiple laptops computers tablets and phones to it.  So that I can have access to all of my files from all of these devices.  Is it perfect?  No.  But looking at reviews of any personal clouds available not many seem perfect.  I have used Plex on it.  It took a process to setup on the cloud's plex app but eventually I got it to work.  I do not use it often though.  It backs up any hard drives you already have so you can automatically put their content onto this cloud drive by connecting to it through USB.  I have it plugged into my router.  I just assumed I would need to do this when I purchased it but I see people giving it 1 stars for this reason.  THIS IS A CLOUD.  This is not a harddrive.  If you're looking for fast transfer speeds unlimited upload sizes etc.  If 5 gigabyte files are too small for you...then you may be better off getting a traditional harddrive.  THis has been great for storing pictures videos and files.  I love that access to it can happen from any of my devices.  After reading the reviews I did not expect it to be this good but I guess I am just using it way different than others.
3,Purchase on 20 October 2020.This NAS drive from Western Digital is really good for the price.Pros:Pretty Much Plug and PlayVery easy to setup and work withYou're able to enable Plex Server on this driveDesign is very sleek for an 8TBCons:Unable to load a huge amount of data in 1 time without overheatingRequires a external fan to keep cool when trying to stream for long periods of timeInstructions says to keep the drive up right for and don't block ventilation but setting it up right blocks the bottom ventilationRequires an external fan to keep hard drive from overheatingOverall: I give this drive a 3 star for the Modification from overheating and misleading instructions to keep the drive up right so it doesn't block the ventilations (but keeping it up right blocks the bottom ventilation).
3,As a storage device this is okay. But the app is not good. The A.I. for photo tagging is terrible and there's not much information out there about it so that's why I'm attaching photos for you to see it. I have thousands of photos and it only tagged less than 1 percent of them. In addition to that many of the tags were wrong.Tagging is an important feature for searching photos. As you can see in the "Basketball court" search almost all the photos are not basketball related...If you're considering this as an alternative to Google photos it's definitely not even close because of the software and A.I.
5,I like this backup drive. It connects to our local network via Cat6 cable and does it's job without any input on my part. I just set up Time Machine (the Mac backup program) to save backups to this drive and it works. 8TB is just about enough space for me (I have about 5TB of movies and TV shows on my server). It's fast enough (limited by the network speed) the price was good and so far it has worked flawlessly. Strongly recommended.
5,I am very happy with this product. It does what is says. I backed up both my PC and mobiles. Also I created an account for my wife to back up her mobile galleries. You will find no problem in uploading speed as long as you use the applications come with the product.
1,This product is junk there is no way to watch movies or pics or music from the machine without being logged into the drive. Do not purchase amazon does not stand by this product. You can't return it or get a replacement. Huge waste of money
5,Easy to set up and use but make sure you download the app for your pc or other devices in order to use it with ease
1,This only does folder "Syncing" which means if you accidently delete something it will delete on the MyCloud Home. There is no software provided to do a desktop or laptop backup.
3,You should say 2 TB worth of storage because of Raid so misleading for non techy customers
1,This is more of an external hard drive or a cloud than it is a nas. Plex doesn't play off this. And the machine is very slow. Dont buy this. Save yourself the time and anguish.
1,Bought this to transfer current media (mapped according to Plex  standard directory structure). There are only a few built in libraries based on file type. New libraries can be designated but not populated.  Reference is made to features which do not exist in the basic setup. With only one file structure the best result with the Roku app is to sort by folder.  Roku Media Player provides equivalent access. Taken days to get this far. Questions to Plex support are about libraries indicate there is no plan for a user defined library. Be sure to read Plex community Q&A before you buy this.
5,The device is very intuitive quick down loading and quick to access my photos anywhere.  Faster than any of the cloud storage I was using.  Great product
1,Horrific software and customer support you wait in chat for an hour then it drops you.  Ridiculous that you can't just automatically set it up and access it I'm sending it back on Monday if I don't get support.
4,Tech support is minimal. Most of the information I got was through online discussion groups.
5,Good product for my need. Works good for file sharing and phone photo backup.
1,Used for 1/2 hour and it stop working call Tech support they said ac adapter was bad (it wasn’t) I bought another ac plugged in the unit didn’t worked. So I’ve returned both.
5,The same that I requested
5,Excellent product and great price.
5,I must start off by saying I was going to give it 3 out of 5 stars but that is because I didn't do my research. You see; I have an earlier version known as My Cloud. There is a difference between the My Cloud and My Cloud Home. The My Cloud is more of a true NAS where the My Cloud Home is more designed to back up cell phones and tablets through Wi-Fi rather than a backing up a computer on the network. The My Cloud Home uses a KDDFS file system rather than a NTFS file system so you can't map the drive on your computer. Again this is my fault for not researching prior to purchase and just assuming it was just the newer version with the same features. So since it is working as it was designed I gave it the 5 out of 5 stars.
5,This seamlessly backs up all my photos and videos and I don't have to worry about running out of storage
5,i can access this thing from anywhere Im about to buy another one for my partner in VA i am so satisfied with this my cloud no more drop box or google drive for me. my phone smart TVs and all my computers are connected now love love love it
5,It is Great storage Cloud easy user interface pretty good storage
1,This device is like a personal dropbox account on a per device basis.You cant map a network drive to a folder in the device. The device does automatically create a personal mapped drive if you use the additional software but it only applies to the machine with the software. That folder cannot be mapped by other devices.You can share folders but via browser links. People who will access these folders in read only will need to set up accounts at wester digital.It can backup items from your social media including facebook and google photos but all private photos become publicly accessible across your devices no way to create hidden folder or keep things from showing up on your phone or a computer that you share with others.
2,I'm a long time WD customer and although aging not a technological troglodyte.  Hardware worked swell - Internet interface worked swell - but for the life of me I could not get the Windows 10 software to properly install/work on a brand new HP 15 Laptop with the latest Windows updates loaded on it.  Without the backup software functioning the entire package is useless for my purposes so returned it via my local UPS store this morning.  Sorry WD.
5,I was very surprised at the ease and the functionality of this cloud platform. It automatically backs up my new photos and files when I come into range and lets me know when it is complete. It is a set it and forget it type of system which is one less thing to worry about when you have over 10000 photos on your phone. I am buying more and set them up at my girlfriends and daughters homes. My intent is to store the Ring video feeds to this home cloud solution along with their files and photos. I have already bragged to my coworkers about this amazing ‘at home’ cloud product.Keep in mind that I have 4TB of space this is better than paying a reoccurring fee to cloud providers to do exactly the same thing.A definite recommend to buy from me!!
5,First one was bad. Customer service was great. Amazon had another input the next day. The second one works wonderfully. I love that I can access all of my stuff on any device.
5,I got this my cloud because my brother told me that I was living in the cavern ages so I decided to give it a try after I unpacked it took me really less than 5 minutes to install it and start to back up my phone files immediately.  Shortly all my family start doing their own back ups too I was surprised as my 14 year old daughter is the one that uses this product the most now she has all her school stuff in it.  After all we don't need to pay extra services to keep back up of our files on the web it pays by itself in about 6 months.  Do yourself a favor and get one of these storage devices.I read many terrible reviews about this product but I realized that they were expecting to use it for different purposes. This piece of equipment is just a back up device that you can reach everywhere in the world.I still need to install Plex on my smart TV's so I can watch movies through the system.Over all this is one of the best investments to our home network.
5,Love it
5,Liked the unit
4,Our trusty old Apple Time Capsule finally needed replacement - its WIFI just wasn't covering all corners of our house. We wanted a networked device to do the same storage function that the Time Capsule did over WIFI (using the Time Machine app on our Macs). After some research I bought this WD NAS HD and one of those new mesh wireless router systems (this device is plugged into our new wireless router using an ethernet cable). The set-up went about 90% as planned. There was one confusing thing in the set-up I goofed up but with one call to Western Digital tech support I solved a minor set-up issue. Their tech support seemed Apple savvy and they knew exactly how to set their product up to work with Time Machine. It is now working just like the Time Capsule. We have several Macs in the house backing up to it. So this was a success!
3,There is no way to recover your data if the hardware failure I bought a second unit to try and change the HDD  but no success. After all I sent it to a recovery company and no way due a encryption modes :( . By now I keep the HDD to see if in the future can recovery the photos ......
5,Excelente
5,Love having a personal private cloud
5,Love this drive easy to set up on multiple devices and get rid of all these apps charging you for iCloud storage. Freed up space on phones and tablets Nice
4,I like how these My Cloud devices work but the reason I purchased this one was to replace my original 4TB My Cloud device that was just 2 years old and had failed. Now I'm having issues with the replacement 4TB My Cloud. It is randomly going offline or into read only mode. So far WD support has been unable to help me and at one point recommended I reformat the drive. If they can't figure this out I'll have to get a new device from another company. This is my back up drive so I need something reliable but these 4TB My Cloud drives have been anything but reliable. I've been lucky not to lose any critical data. I also have an old 1TB My Book Live that is 8 years old and is still working so I expected better from a new My Cloud.
4,The user interface does not allow for complete folder transfer with USB drive.The sort function for “date added” is missing.  Must be added to list.Easy setup and installation.  Reliable.
5,It's nice.  I use it as a Plex server to organize and play movies to my television
5,Great product!
