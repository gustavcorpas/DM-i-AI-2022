5,This item is awesome.Fabric is soft and sturdy .It has so many pockets in different sizes for more than a normal laptop.it is very stylish too.
5,The look is sharp and clean it’s lightweight yet holds a generous amount of items. I easily carried my home laptop and my work laptop at the same time plus two notebooks several books my notary stamp and seal a wallet a makeup bag both computer chargers a phone charger and multiple pens and highlighters. It still zipped up easily and kept its sleek look. Love this bag!
4,It's hard to find a bag that's not leather. This is a good option. Cute with lots of compartments and a comfortable strap. I only wish it had a water bottle pocket.
5,A lot roomier than I thought it would be.  Looks really nice.  I don't think it will withstand rough handling as it is cloth but it is a really nice bag.  Would recommend.
4,I can only rate the bag for the short time I have used it. Durability and sturdiness will ne know over time.  It fits the 17 inch co outer. I Roy good storage spots for cords and other accessories.  Hold iPad with laptop nicely.  Attaches to rolling bag well.  But if carrying on shoulder adding more than laptop and iPad would be more tweight than  I would want to carry.
5,this is everything it says it is and is great quality and has so much room for everything.  Love this bag.
5,On my last trip I lost my ear buds because the velcro didn't hold the front pocket closed well enough. That's why I purchased this one. All the pockets have large secure zipper. I'm very happy with it.
5,Very pretty bag at a very good price!  I love the two small zipper pockets on the outside for quick easy grab of my keys blue tooth lip balm etc.  There is another large zippered pocket on the outside.  Inside are 6 divider pockets of various sizes and a thin pad for computer protection. I LOVE lots of pockets in my purses or bags so this is PERFECT for me!!
5,Lots of room and compartments
5,My employer recently gave me a new-to-me laptop to use when I travel or work from home.  This thing harkens back to my Big 6 accounting days when we use to have to haul an actual PC complete with CPU unit to the client.This bag holds the monstrosity of a laptop along with other necessities.  The strap is comfortable even when it’s holding the weight similar to that of a large child.  The color is lovely and the quilting is a nice feminine touch.  I highly recommend the bag.  I still plan on using it even after I ditch the old laptop.
4,This is a great bag for the money! Has lots of storage spaces
5,Love the looks and it has so many compartments. Definitely not waterproof and if you have your laptop in it  and it falls from a good distance  good luck. But I use it for to and from work.
5,There is lots of room for extra items like the charger book magazines.
5,It offers a large enough pocket for my laptop. Many pockets and compartments to keep everything organized. Over the shoulder strap which I have yet to use due to the heavy load I carry. It is made of cloth so it is not weather proof. So far its been durable. Its only a temporary use anyway. I've already outgrown it and will be getting a rolling bag. I do love it. Will find another use for at. Possibly take it to listing appointments which only certain forms are needed.
5,Daughters laptop
4,This bag is definitely worth the inexpensive purchase but don’t expect durability. It is a quilted cloth bag so it does not retain shape very well but it gets the job done.
5,Bueno
5,I love that so much fits in this bag organized and easy to get to! The large zip pockets  and the separate section in the front is a triple win.  Inside my personal 17 inch and work smaller laptop sit in their own compartments plus the iPad! All the cords headset and adapters fit easily. I use front for purse items. The big win is because it’s super light weight it’s not heavy when packed with devices and needed items. Love this bag!!!
5,Quality is good; however the straps should feel a little more secure and supportive for heavy laptops. Nice pockets for other things and fits up to a  17.5 laptop.
5,I carry A LOT of stuff to work and the cafe and I was a little apprehensive about purchasing this item though surprisingly this has been a major convenience for me. It holds my laptop books chargers makeup and stuff and though the material looks and feels cheap it honestly does the job.
5,It holds everything
5,So glad I purchased this bag really like the color as well.  It is very comfortable to carry in my hand or on the shoulder.  Love the strap that allows for it to be attached to the handle of my roller bag...awesome!The amount of room is really impressive!  I also have received a lot of compliments on the bag.
5,A 17 inch laptopFits well.  It has lots ofRoom for storage.  It’s a very durable bag and attractive.
5,really cute and elegant love it
5,I got this bag for a business trip and I’m glad I did it was perfect for my laptop a few cables and personal items that I would usually carry in my purs. It fits under the airplane seat with no problem.
5,This is exactly what I needed for my laptop. Great purchase. Sturdy and strong. Great price.
4,I like this bag it is very stylish with losts of pockets the only issue I have with it is that it doesn't have enough padding but other than that it is a nice bag.
5,Holds all my this I need.
5,I purchase this bag to go put my school stuff.  It’s very pretty and light.  I like the fact that it can hold my papers and my MacBook safely and  neatly.  I also like that I have two ways to carry it: handles and slang. I would definitely recommend this.
5,I love the color and it is very spacious.
5,I actually purchased this item for my large remote DVD player.  Since it's 17in I needed a large bag and this bag is perfect.  The remote charging cord head phones earbuds car charger cleaning wipes and the large dvd player fit in the bag with room to spare.  Everything needed is in one bag for home or travel.  The bag is a very subtle pink and the gold zippers make it appear very luxurious.  I searched and searched for a large enough bag and am so happy that I found this one on Amazon.
5,This bag holds everything I need it to and it fits comfortably over my shoulder.  I didnt want a briefcase looking bag and something smaller than a tote and this bag suited my needs better than I expected. It is wider than I expected but not overly wide that it feels like you are carrying a purse. Perfect for work and school and carrying my personal items.
5,The bag holds my laptop iPad and several other items easily. It has several compartments to keep things organized. The shoulder strap makes it easy to carry. I love this bag.
5,Bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it.
4,Love the texture and size and the color!
5,So happy with this stylish computer bag. Looks very professional too! Looks of compartments & zip pockets. The gold zipper & pulls me are high quality. Love how it has strap to slide onto luggage handle.
3,The bag is very roomy but also soft and kind of flimsy. It also makes a squeaky sound at the shoulder strap when you walk. No major defects so far but I don’t see this bag providing much support / protection when full.
3,Due to the fabric of the bag once you start filling it it is no longer cute.  It takes the shape of whatever you put inside.  For me that is a serious flaw.  I have the bag away to someone and they love it.  So it's for somebody just not me.The bag is well made and the different pockets are a plus.  I love an organized bag.  However this bag doesn't deliver on a neat chic lol because it becomes bulky and odd.
5,It’s so stylish and pretty. It is well padded and has numerous pockets for all of my devices and attachments.
5,I love this bag it is light weight and great for traveling.
4,I love all the variety of pockets. I have no idea how the stitching will hold out because it’s new. I docked one star for fabric. I got a black bag and the polyester fabric attracts everything to it. I have 2 dogs and a cat. Hair all over it! I had to use a lint roller. I’m keeping it because I otherwise like it and am using it for tutoring supplies. It will be fine if you don’t have pets. The 17.3 Inch Laptop Bag LIGHT FLIGHT Travel Business Briefcase looks like it has the same pocket arrangement but is made of nylon. If you have pets it or something similar in nylon might be better.
5,I have this bag in pink and bought one for my daughter in black.  Very nice looking - well made - fits a lap top as well as charger and other items.  Great for work or school.  Has roomy pockets.  Love the bag.
5,I use this to transport my laptop and paperwork to/from work. Recently I used it on my vacation as a "personal carry" item on airplane. Perfect size. So far very sturdy and I've had it packed full and heavy. Only negative is it's quilted material and I have cats so the cat hair sticks to it but that's with everything when you're a cat owner. This bag has been great and useful.
4,I bought this for myself because my other bag was too small. This one has so many pockets and I love the space. Everything fits perfectly. My coworker liked mine so much she got one too.
5,Laptop fits nicely.  Well made.
5,I am using this as my every day laptop bag and so far it’s been perfect.  Tons of pockets to keep things organized.  Love it!
5,I love this bag.  I will be using it for business as a briefcase.  It is a very soft pink and the extra touches like the gold hardware and quilting features make it look very feminine but not gaudy.  Perfect for business meetings formal or not.
5,This case looks so nice. It doesn’t look cheaply made. I love the pockets on it. Can’t wait to use it
5,Great bag. Looks nice lots of pockets & compartments. Exactly as pictured.
5,Plenty of room. Lots of pockets. Perfect size.
5,This bag is very well made and looks expensive.  Several different compartments for me to carry everything I need when I am traveling between my offices. The shoulder strap has a padded band which is very comfortable on my shoulder
5,Good price. Enough room for stuffs
5,Lot of room  color not enough pink and would be better in leather or faux leather . Love the little bag it will fulfill my needs to Cary my laptop and big iPad at the same time my only down is and it’s not major is that I  thought the pink was I litter more pink than it is looks more like very dusty in color and I think of buying the electronic organizer to go with it
5,This bag was exactly what I was looking for to protect my new laptop.  It has plenty of space and pockets for anything you my need to take with you and your laptop.It is also very stylish.  I wanted something that protected my laptop and also wanted it to look great.  I got both with this bag.It is lightweight but has plenty of padding for protection. The straps are wide and comfortable for carrying.  Plenty of outside pockets to hold your wallet and keys if you only want to carry one bag. It also has pockets on the inside for your phone and tablet.I am extremly happy with this purchase.  Going to see if they make smaller tablet cases...
5,Very pretty. Fits my keyboard mouse headphones and other items. Perfect size for a carry on for my flights. Could be more padded but it gets the job done. I defiantly would be scared of dropping it.
4,Holds my extra large laptop 3 inch binder and all laptop cords and accessories. Love the shoulder strap and front pockets.
5,El color y la calidad son increíble mejor de lo que esperaba!
4,It has a lot of pockets and storage places for all your things. It’s not overly padded so if you want extra support you should use a sleeve with it. It’s very lightweight and stylish. I like it.
5,LOVE Everything about this product
5,Very nice love all the room it has to offer.
3,I received the computer bag today and it is very cute and roomy.  However I was very disappointed in how it was packaged.  It came in a box that would accommodate the full width of the bag but the bag was folded over on one end packaged in a plastic bag.  Now it doesn't lay flat and there is a big crease 1/3 of the way through it.  Haven't decided if I will keep it because I am not sure the crease will disappear.
5,The bag is beautiful and practical! It’s not very comfortable to be used over the shoulders and there is a space missing for water bottle which could improve the product… but overall the bag is great and I’m very satisfied about it!
3,17.3 inch pink bag-Using for a laptop textbooks and personal items. I was so excited because the lips looks so pretty modern and my styleCons:1. The color is not as pretty in person as it is online. Bag is clean but LOOKS like it needs to be washed due to the dirty dusty pink hue. Hard to describe. Disappointed for sure.2. All the clasp components are plastic so it looks really cheap and I'm just waiting for them to break due to the weight of my laptoo and textbooks and my bag come crashing to the ground.3. I wish the bottom of the bag had insulation to protect the laptop.Pros:Lots of interior room and lots of sections pockets etc. This bag really can hold books folers notebooks laptop my lunch gidgets gadgets my large wallet and any item a woman could possibly put in her purse in the different sections. I have all these items in this bag daily.It's OK for temporary use for now but maybe I'll invest more money in a better bag.
5,Love these bag. It’s perfect size and looks great!
4,i honestly love this bag!! it’s very sturdy and can hold a ton!! the only issue with it that i had personally was that it was a bit uncomfortable on my neck with the crossbody strap. that’s it though!!
4,I really like this bag and it’s sleek style.
3,Not as “firm” as you’d believe but overall great
5,I’ve bought my wife three computer bags and this one she can’t stop raving about because of the shoulder strap comfort the material of the bag and also the fashionable look. She must have said “I love this bag” a hundred times. So wife approved is an a+ rating for me.
5,Much larger than expected. Perfect fit with endless storage. Fits everything you’ll need and much more!
5,This bag looks great but is also a sturdy bag with a lightly padded slot for a laptop.  It has a couple of zipper pockets that are nice and roomy also.
3,I was so excited to get this bag and use it for my conference last week. It had so many pockets and space that I didn’t need a purse and a laptop bag. My only use of the bag!!!!!  The bag is able to hold alot of things however it gets heavy; and the heaviest thing in it was my laptop: no books or tablets.  The outside where the two pockets are folded in (I didn’t fill up the inside of the bag) so that was disheartening. The outside zipper on the side for the long pocket broke so I had to move things to the inside so it wouldn’t fall out.  I can’t use it like I want with that large compartment zipper broken so that sucks!! And the company does seem to offer a warranty past 30 days from what I have seen.  Great in theory but practically this bag will get very heavy is used as pictured.
5,Great for anyone who's on the go a lot I don't have an office desk and because I constantly need to drive have an "office on the go" really helps
5,This bag was exactly what I needed for my Trip.  My Laptop fit perfectly and was just right weight wise.  I did not over stuff the bag.  I has plenty of room and the strap for putting over your luggage pull handle was perfect.
4,I wish it was more padded and thick especially on the bottom when held by handles because when you place it down it feels like your laptop is having direct contact with the floor.  The design is cute though and I like the little pockets and compartments.
5,I love it. It's beautiful. Seems sturdy. Fits my huge 17 inch Dell laptop. It's black but still feminine. I have yet to use it but I know it will be fine.
4,I love how spacious and soft it is. If I had the option to change anything it would be to make it look less like a diaper bag but overall I am happy with my purchase!
4,Used it for my bag on airplane! Had plenty of room for all is my extra things! Fit under the seat just fine!
4,Could have used about 1 “ more in depth.
3,Nice bag but much bigger than I expected.  Would be great to use for travel but too big and bulky for daily work use
4,Very fashionable but my laptop did not go in and out of the bag easily too snug a fit.
5,Finally! A nice looking computer carrier for women with loads of room for accessories and office supplies! Lightweight. Lots of pockets. Love it!! Can't comment on sturdiness or durability because I haven't had it very long. Love the strap on the back that can slide over a suitcase extended handle. Very excited about using this bag.
5,Love the compartments and accessibility of this bag. Easy to go through airport security and have items available with just a zip.
5,The best ever
5,This bag is very roomy with several pockets and compartments. I packed 2 laptops iPad notebook planner snacks essential meds and toiletries (TSA approved sizes). Everything fit well but it was too heavy.  Although the bag held up I wouldn't pack that much in it again.It is a pretty bag. The black quilted material and gold zippers give off statement piece.The luggage loop is a nice extra.It lacks that extra bottom padding. But the inside padding secured my laptops and iPad very well.Overall I recommend this laptop bag.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Good product for the money. Holds my oversized laptop with no problem. Small handle vinyl covering is a bit cheap looking but overall after a month it’s holding up well.
4,It’s a nice bag just not for my needs. Too soft. It kept folding up
4,Laptop carrier/protection
5,This computer bag is very well made and I looks very sophisticated!
5,Lightweight and pretty to look at
5,Got this for my daughter for Christmas and she uses it daily absolutely loves it. She loves that she can fit more than just her laptop in it and works great for carrying stuff to work.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This bag is bigger than I expected which wasn’t what I was going for. I wanted something a little smaller so it’s easier for me to carry. However I wasn’t disappointed by the quality or all the compartments that’s in this bag. I have enough room to put all my work stuff in here along with my laptop. I do recommend it for the price and quality!
5,perfect size to carry laptop and not break my back.
5,I love it! It's perfect for what I need plus it's stylish.
5,This is a nice bag for the price. Lots of compartments. My only negative remark is the plastic hook and connectors on the sides for the strap seems a little flimsy so I hope they don’t break!
5,Love the style and it functions great! Hoping it lasts it's not the sturdiest fabric for a bag.
5,comodo
3,Just didn’t like the style as well as a back pack.
5,I am most pleased with the interior protective pocket which helps protect a computer or iPad from scratches and some impact.  Stylish and well made.
5,This stylish bag holds my large laptop and many other things! So many compartments for easy organization!!
5,This briefcase is perfect and exactly as it appears in pictures. Quality is great my 17” Mac laptop fits in this bag and it’s extreme roomy and so fashionableI highly reccommend this briefcase
4,This is a very sturdy laptop bag but it is quite large.  I like the extra pockets on the outside for my phone or pens.  I would recommend this but make sure you get the right size.
3,Ok for the value third one I gave it a try not happy but I will keep it
4,Bag is very roomy with lots of storage pockets/ compartments.  Exactly what I needed to use as a computer bag / briefcase.  Only complaint is the wierd creases it got during shipping.  Can't seem to get rid of them!
5,These was one of the best purchases I made for my laptop
5,This bag is the perfect size. I work from home two days a week and have to take a laptop keyboard mouse a dock station and the plug for that. It all fits in there as well as various files my glasses etc. Plenty of space! I’m pleasantly surprised with it and highly recommend. Straps are sturdy and comfortable on my shoulder as well.
5,Me parece un producto muy útil es cómodo de llevar y tiene varios compartimentos donde caben muchas cosas.
4,I can fit my personal and work laptop with cords and work. The only thing I wish is if it were made with a material that can be wiped off.
5,Lightwieght & cute.
5,absolutely love this bag !! i have a rather large laptop so i was worried it wouldn’t actually fit but it fits perfectly and there’s so much room for my other equipment. so so happy i purchased this !!
4,Great product.
5,I love this bag!  It’s so cute!  Nice material and lots of pockets for great organization. I got the bag slightly larger than my computer so I could fit my keyboard in there also with no problem.
5,This bag is a great value for the price. It looks great and holds a lot with so many pockets on. The inside.
5,Nice bag with ample room for laptop and other items. Professional looking bag. Waiting to see how it holds up if it gets wet however.
5,It’s big and it’s dirty and light weight it is perfect for on the go
5,Love the bag and the space inside! It's really perfect for my needs. It's lightweight even with my computer and "stuff." It's a quilted cotton material which I wasn't expecting.
5,Wanted a laptop case but Wow got much more  love this bag it’s functional and has several organized sections. Would highly recommend
5,Carrying my laptop
5,I really like this bag.  It is for my new 16” MacBook Pro.  Plenty of space for laptop and additional items.Classy looking bag.  Seems to be well made so far.  Would recommend.
5,My laptop tablet  and books fit  plus chargers
5,It fits my 17 in laptop my book notebook as well as my personal bag.
5,So happy I purchased this  product! Opens wide so you can easily find things very roomy and love that there are pockets for extra items.
5,Beautiful design and holds a lot - love it
5,Love the size for my 17 inch computer.  Can't wait to take my computer out in this beautiful case. The fabric is soft and gold accent zippers adds a little  pizzazz .
5,Made well just as described.
5,I really like this bag.  It roomy and has a lot of pockets for extra storage
5,I love my bag! It is wonderful and it met my need. Multiple pockets easy to use and great product!
5,I can store MANY things on here. Durable nice looking and dividers are terrific.
5,my wife really likes her new laptop bag thanks
2,I ordered this thinking it would be perfect.  Why would they stuff it into a bag that's too small?  The seller suggested I fill it with clothes and "eventually" it would come out.  It was unsightly enough that I opted for returning it.  I do not recommend this bag.
5,Actually fits a 17.3 inch laptop. Can be used as a purse as well as a laptop case. lots of storage space inside and a little expandable. outside pockets fit wallet and all sized phones. Great product!
2,I have a 16.” laptop and it doesn’t fit into the bag… I don’t now I received the wrong product or what. Product quality is nice! Wish I could use it I really needed one for work
5,I had bought a new laptop at Best Buy and it was bigger than my old one. No bags at Best Buy so looked on line and found this bag. Works great!
5,Very sturdy and fits my large laptop well.  Lots of room for files and accessories.
5,Love it!! Lite weight but very sturdy and protective.  Amazing price and fast shipping
5,This bag looks just as good as it does in the pics. Very stylish and it’s padded for protection! It also has a few storage compartments for power cords and other miscellaneous items! Super cute and functional! I love it!
5,The case fits my laptop perfectly.  Wished I’d ordered a different color.
3,Not professional but ok to have. Retired now so I’m laid back. It works!
5,The bag is bigger than I thought which is very helpful since I use it for work. Only a week in use but so far so good.
5,I love it ! Almost looks like a purse . Matches my purse so well! I get a compliment on it almost every time I’m out
3,Very pretty but no side protection and very little on the front and back. Honestly I hate to give negative reviews.  I would rather just send it back and not say anything at all. But my laptop it’s very expensive and I needed an attractive but sturdy protection for it. I’ll Probably keep it and sew something in myself to make it more safe. On a brighter note it’s very light weight.
3,Its a little bulky & a little flimsy for my liking but it’s really big on the inside so that makes up for what I don’t like about it. Definitely will hold all you need to put in there
2,Cute but definitely not best quality. You get what you pay for. The logo does look very cheap. I suggest purchasing another bag honestly. Too late for me to return.
5,Very elegant and easy to carry
5,All the space it has love it
5,This a great case and it’s very inviting too.
5,True to picture. I love the color get tons of compliments on it and it is pretty roomy!
5,Absolutely love this. So many pockets and very roomy. Its really well made and quite beautiful.  Comfortable strap not bulky not heavy and holds everything neatly. Highly recommend.
5,I love the design.  It looks elegant and professional.
5,I really like this bag. It looks stylish and professional! Great buy very roomy. Yes I do recommend it! 😊
5,I thought it was going to be a different material but I am happy with what I received.  Thank you.
5,This product was exactly what I was looking for. Love the color and how well it's made.
3,I did not really like the color. It had lots of pockets in it but not a lot of space.
5,Really love this bag it looks great very roomy holds everything I need lits of pockets
5,Birthday gift
5,Great bag for work!
5,For my computer mostly
1,This case is neither sturdy nor durable. And it seems to collect fuzz balls and dirt. I wouldn’t even give it away. Worst laptop case I have ever owned.
2,Beautiful pink color but generally appeared cheap. The lining seemed to be cheap plastic and I expected it to tear at any time. Returned but for some reason I only received about half of what I purchased it for.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               No tiene buen soporte. La tela es de mala calidad. Lo bueno es que tiene muchos bosillos.Lo compre para llevar mi laptop pero no me parece seguro.
2,Bag was small
1,It's a very flimsy bag. And if you add anything to the pickets it doesn't close right. The velcro that holds the laptop in place is so long it doesn't hold the laptop in place.
1,This bag is yuck! Had a had time giving it away. UGLY!
5,Great Quality much nicer than the pictures. Very durable and lightweight
2,I liked the size but the zippers broke

5,Very cute and stylish bag for a great price
5,For a laptop plus other necessities
5,computerBagConvenient carries tablet phone etc.  I use it as a pocket book as well.
5,This bag is big enough to carry everything I want and it's so light that it doesn't feel like a huge load on my shoulder when my laptop is in it. Good buy so far.
5,Lots of compartments great for organizing laptop journal pens cell phone etc. Nice size...alot bigger than I thought soft and fashionable exterior....great bag for the money!! Highly recommend.
5,Needed a laptop bag that would accommodate not only my computer but also a keyboard mouse charger files etc.  This one works very well.  The many pockets will keep everything organized & the padding should keep everything safe.  Plus it's pretty darned stylish.
5,I not only carry my laptop computer but also my Surface Pro and tons of papers.  It all fits beautifully.
5,very nice
5,
5,The material on this briefcase bag is very nice and classy.  I have not found very many bags that fit my computer because it is an 17.3" and is too big for most cute bags.  The zippers are sturdy and smooth and it is roomy.  Its very well made.
5,I was able to add all items I needed for lunch and dinner.
5,This is a really great bag exactly as described. One of the only bag that actually fits my larger laptop. Tons of pockets and places for organization. Fabric and hardware look very high end great look for the price. Main section opens almost down not quite “clamshell” but provides great access to items inside.
5,Perfect for my new laptop. Plenty of room for other items.
5,This Bag is great large plenty of room lots of compartments soft Zippers are sturdy. This Bag is well made no regrets on this bag
5,After reading lots of reviews on bags I selected this one. I LOVE it! It’s super soft and lots of compartments for organizing. The shoulder strap is padded and I’m really happy with this choice. I recommend!
5,
5,So cute and stylish. Enough room to hold my whole life lol
5,I love this bag
5,This is stylish and roomyNo purse neededAll in one bag
5,But it is great
5,I love this bag.  Plenty of room to store computer plug mouse and keyboard.  It went through TSA without a problem.  I was able to also carry my wallet phone and extra accessories on the plane with ease.
5,Used for laptop.
5,This bag is great. It is slim yet holds alot of stuff and isn't heavy to carry.
5,Lots of space for computer charger headphones and files. I love the beauty of it as well.
5,I will be using this for school and I think it will be perfect for what I need. The bag is big enough for what i meed but not too big where it looks huge on me; I am a small person and the bag is perfect for my size! (I am 5'2)It has so many pockets too! Perfect for little items and extra necessities!
