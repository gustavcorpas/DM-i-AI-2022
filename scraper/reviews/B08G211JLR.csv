1,So I really did not know what to expect. I have heard about Skullcandy I have seen their products in Best Buy but I’ve never owned any of their headphones.I have a pair of beats solo Pro. I was looking for earbuds that have the same functionality as far as active noise cancellation and transparency mode. I also wanted to make sure that the sound is great. I like to have a lot of bass. And I also like to have clear highs and lows.However I really did not feel like spending $249 on Apple AirPods Pro. Plus I think the Apple AirPods Pro our grade buds but I believe that they don’t have enough bassI’ve done a decent amount of research on different buds. I looked at brands like monster and anchor and I’ve looked at last known brands that are out there that are probably are coming out of China.However I have not been able to find exactly what I am looking for.I came across Skullcandy Indy ANC purely by accident. I saw a few reviews that are written on Amazon and I was able to find some YouTube video reviews as well.So these arrived today. I am so happy.So the buds are matte black and color.The case is Matt black as well with LED battery indicators on the front. Case looks very similar to Apple AirPods Pro.The way that the buds said inside the case is very familiar as well. The presentation is very nice. And appears to be made from quality cardboard and paper. There is a nice foam centerpiece inside the box that holds the case and the buds.There are also some papers that tell you about the product. There is a USB type C charger and cable. A baggie with two differentSizes of ear tips. In the baggie there is also a smaller pair of the wingtips.I was worried that the wingtips will be made out of hard plastic. They are soft and rubbery just like the tips.There is an app that’s associated that downloading is probably a good idea. On the app you can set up your own sound profile. The buds will create sound that best fits for your ears. That’s pretty cool.Through the app you can also control the noise cancellation and the transparency mode. Also you can control the EQ. On the app is included user guide. Warrantee information product registration and other things.I also did find a YouTube video from Skullcandy that has the QuickStart guide. I thought that was way more helpful than the user guide alone.Everything that you can think of as far as controls can be done directly on the buds. The logos on the buds are touch controls. It’s a little to get used to but after a few times it becomes natural.After setting up the sound I am not sure what they sound like without setting up sound profile is actually very very nice. The base is good it’s not overpowering. It’s nice and crisp. The highs and meds are very very nice. The lows are nice.I am very impressed with the sound quality of these buds.The call quality is very good. The interaction with your voice assistant is very simple and intuitive.Personally when listening to music and watching YouTube videos and movies on my phone I think for those things the movie mode in the EQ works the best.Both the noise canceling and the transparency modes are very good as well. There is definitely a very noticeable difference when switching between the two.There is also a normal mode where active noise canceling and transparency is turned off.I honestly think that there is not a lot of very noticeable difference of the sound of whatever you might be listening to when switching between these three modes which is actually very good.To summit all up I I am very happy with  these buds. I like how they feel in my ears. The fit and finish is super nice. The controls are intuitive. The sound quality is very very good. I have not fully drained them so I cannot tell you how my batteries lasted. But if you want to see the battery specs you can read the description of the item.Apparently these retails for $130. Amazon had them on sale for $99. I am not sure how long this deal is going to be available. For what you’re getting that’s a really good price. Even the full price of $130 is still a good price for what you’re getting because it’s still less than its main competition.I would definitely buy again and I would definitely recommend these.So this is an update. When I picked up these headphones they were new. There was not a lot of information available online. No it appears that my left Bud went out. Of course it’s after the return window. After researching left bud going out apparently is a common issue with these headphones. I contacted Amazon. Nothing they could do it. I was told to contact the manufacturer. Will be contacting the manufacturer today or tomorrow. Will post an update to see what happens.This is an update. I am changing my review from five stars to one star.When I first received the item I was very happy with these headphones. They sounded great. They function great. They were exactly what I was looking for.A few days ago and my left headphone went out. After doing research on these headphones online and reading technical forums I found out that apparently it’s a common issue with these that either the left or the right will go out.Hi contacted Amazon to see if I could get some assistance and Amazon was unable or unwilling to help. Because it is past the 30 day return window. They were not willing to take into consideration the fact that these are perhaps defective from the manufacture because of the fact that either the left or the right going out is a very common issue.I contacted the manufacturer to see if I can make a warranty claim. I can because they are covered for two years with manufacturers warranty.That’s also a pain in the ass. I have to go to the website print out a form or fill out a form online then print it then print a shipping label. Take it to a post office or UPS or FedEx. And if I make a warranty claim and ship it back to them I am the one that hast to pay the shipping costs. The manufacturer does not want to cover shipping costs.I honestly wish that I would have just spent the extra money and bought the Apple AirPods Pro. At least when it comes to Apple products Apple stands behind their products 100%. And I can take that product into any Apple store or any store like Best Buy that is a certified Apple retailer and my items can be exchanged with no question asked.Lesson learned.Knowing what I know now as far as these headphones having the common issue of either the left or the right going out I would not have purchased these. And I do not recommend you purchasing them either because you will be faced with the same issue that I’m having right now. Save your money spend the extra cash and buy the Apple AirPods Pro.
4,I discovered Skullcandy years ago in a desperate search for earbuds that wouldn't need constant adjusting or fall out of my ears every 30 seconds while running. I bought these (my first pair of completely wireless buds) last year to replace my trusty Skullcandy Ink'd. I live on the surface of the sun (you'd think by our summers) and having something on the back of my neck during hot sweaty runs was getting on my nerves. Plus they tend to slide off your neck while doing mat and bench work at the gym.The Indy Fuel buds are as reliably comfortable and snug in the ear as anything from Skullcandy. The noise canceling and ambient modes are usefully functional. The sound is great for music and podcasts. I will charge the case with the buds in it about once per 8-10 days and that works for me. I'd say I use them 3 hours per day on average. They pair up very easily with whatever device I need to use and the range is good. I've left my phone in the house and made it easily 50 feet outside of my house before the signal started breaking.The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is actually something that may just be intrinsic to this kind of device and that's interference. The only time I ever have connectivity issues is when I'm in the part of my gym that's most crowded. It seems that if there are more than 15 or so people within a 25-foot radius of me my signal cuts in and out. It's a minor annoyance but still annoying. As I stated this may just be a thing that is. Too many people with earphones/buds on the same frequency in close proximity certainly causes interference.Overall this is a great product which I highly recommend.
5,I got these Tuesday 9/20. I opened them last night 9/22. I paired them with my phone and set up my hearing profile on the app and listened to a song. It was amazing I almost cried. I could feel the song. The set up was easy with the app and you pair them to your phone just like any other Bluetooth device. I haven't had a phone call with them yet so I will update my review after that. I hope they last longer than my headset that these are replacing. I have never had noise canceling before and it is a beautiful thing. If your looking for kick ass hear buds these are it for sure.
4,My charger box has quit working. Went through steps to clean contacts but that wasn't it. The USB cable was very short and looked different than any other ones I've seen. This cable can be inserted upside down and it doesn't say that anywhere. Caused a short in charger/carrier and now won't charge them at all. On top of that they would randomly cut out or when using the assistant the sound quality dramatically decreased or cut out one side. Technology is there and works more often than not just a couple annoying bugs to fix.
4,The battery does not last as long as the sesh evo batteries. The noise canceling is very nice as well as the sound amplifier feature. But overall I feel like the sesh evo by skull candy is a better value.
4,I would put 5 stars but the logo on the ear tips  scrapes the skin and you can’t wear them for more than 4 hours without getting a rash I have to wear one and then the other. I just bought some smooth ear tips to get around that issue.Other than that it has great quality in sound and battery life is pretty good. If you run out of battery just put the buds back in the case for a bit I charge the case every two days and honestly that’s impressive. (At least compared to the previous earbuds I used.)I would recommend for people who just need to use the earbuds 1-3 hours daily and if you want to use these most of the day just get other ear tips that way you won’t have rashes in your ears. 👍
4,For the price they are pretty hard to beat. Slower to connect when taking out of the case but tough to beat comparatively. Accidentally went through wash and still work!
4,I use an android phone for work and iphone/iPad in my personal life. I had air pods pro they got washed and these were on sale for a price I couldn’t pass. They sound better then my AirPods after you get them tuned to your ears through the app. But to move from apple to droid and back is cumbersome (on phones) As the AirPods Pro’s you say connect to them and they just do with out fuss. If I just used these on my android phone for work then 5/5. But toss apple in the mix it’s kinda a mixed bag. Be nicer if the app worked better on apple too. Would I buy them again soft yes. They are comparing 2 different class of earbuds but hope this helps. Also I plan on the air pods pro 2s and keeping these on my work phone later.
5,Title says it all. Didn't fall out my ears when I got hit by a car. 10/10 would buy again.Noise cancelling is actually pretty good and ambient mode for being able to hear when riding a bike or out in the street and needing to be able to hear your surroundings.
4,I think the silicone earbud tips could be a little thicker/more substantial. They need to seal just a bit better that would’ve got a fifth star.
4,Worked great for for about 3 months then they stopped synching with each other (right and left buds).I searched the internet tried tech savy friends to help me nothing works. I emailed customer service and they told me to return them. 2 weeks later they replaced the earbuds for free!
4,If used around loud noises normally they begin to create noise when it’s not noisy in your environment
5,Great entry level wireless earbuds that feel premium.  I got these on sale for around $60. I've own now for 6-8 months and use on a daily basis.The only con about these is I which the plastic ear fins were more permanent position they tend to fall off/move alot more then I'd like.Outside of that.  Battery life quality and reliability  are VERY GOOD.
3,I am having a love hate relationship w/these ear buds.What I like about these ear buds was first the price...these are much more affordable than some other name brand blue tooth earbuds but the performance also explains the price differences.The sound:  These do sound really good.Noise Cancelling:  Very good for earbuds maybe even a little too good.  I run w/these and still want to be able to hear road noise.Fit:  These fit me very well and stay put while running.  To me this is probably the best part.  I have not had good luck w/earbuds staying put while running or lifting hard.  These do that.  I find myself checking them often out of habit and they are tightly in place.Battery Life:  I've not had an occasion where the batteries have run dead.  I use them put them back in their case and they are ready for my next workout.Telephone calls:  Works well while making and taking phone calls.The not so good:The functions:  Too many.  On/Off pair pause really are the only things I need.Pairing:  I can only get these to pair to one item.  If I pair to my phone I cannot pair to my watch.  The first time out of the case they automatically paired to my phone.  When I tried to also pair them to my watch following the very complicated pairing sequence of button pushing I could not get it to pair.  I had to completely unpair these from my phone to get them to pair to my watch.  Then I could not get the earbuds to pair back to my phone.I also get a lot of static and drop off while in these.  It's not on common for one of the ears to lose sound while out running or walking.  I also get a static sound pretty frequently which requires me to pause and restart playing music.In the end I do not think I would buy these again unless they come out w/a better version.  If they could make earbuds with this fit and work like some others they would be perfect.  Until then I'll use these until they die and probably not replace them w/more SkullCandy earbuds unless some improvements are made.
5,These are great. I bought them for when i am cutting the grass and on airplanes. Does a great job of cancelling the outside noise and the noise quality has been great for me. Wish the battery would last longer but it is up there with the others available.
5,I bought these for myself and my son and we absolutely love them but for some reason only one headphone will play at a time and neither one of us can understand why this happens we have a disconnected the headphones and reconnected them hoping this would help and it does not we are hoping there is a solution to this problem
3,So the sound is great they last for hours and the ambient mode is a spectacular function.I only have 3 gripes...1. If you have them in for long periods of time the silicon piece that helps hold the ear bud in starts to irritate and hurt my ear even with the smaller size.2. speaking of smaller size the same piece that hurts and irritates my ear doesn't let the case fully close unless you have the smaller size on the ear bud. not an issue for me because I use the smaller piece but for anyone else its a pain and an oversight for the amount of money I spent.3. I only ever really use one earbud at a time anyway but if you use them at the same time they skip like a scratched cd. but ONLY when they are both connected. Once again it works out that I only use them one or the other at a time but if I'm watching something with my SO its 50% of the time is inaudible.In all I'm glad I got these on sale because if I paid full price I would have returned them already.... But they serve the purpose I need them for very well. I just wish I got the value I paid for the product I received.
5,I like the options you have turn up down change songs back-and-forth and turn on other options
3,TLDR:Pro: Sound quality better than airpod proCon: Connectivity issuesResult: ReturnedI had high expectations for these as I grew up using skull candy everything. And when I tried them I was thoroughly impressed. A little background I cut grass/landscaping. So lots of noise near my ears noise filtering is a must. I purchased these to use as a back up while my airpod pros would be charging. The sound quality of these blow the airpods out of the water I could not be more happy about that. They are also more comfortable when wearing over long periods of time. The only draw back is the left ear bud will disconnect for several seconds every couple of minutes. And on the rare occasion disconnect until placed back in the case and taken back out to re pair with the phone. I wish these things would stay connected They would for sure replace the airpods hands down. Unfortunately they get returned as connectivity is the most important thing of all.
5,I've had these for almost a year now and they are good especially if you buy them with a discount.Sound - The 'Personal Sound' is a must!Without this feature the sound is almost flat with a little bit of bass.Once you've set up this feature it improves the mids and highs mostly this helps a lot the sound quality. You need the app to set up the Personal Sound.ANC - Decent for the price and size.I own the Sony XM3s and the ANC is still one of the best in the current market. Taking that level of ANC and comparing it to the ANC of these earbuds; they're decent and good for the price. I've used them in busy malls office environment coffee shops and at home. They reduce the sound greatly and with loud environments you won't have to raise the volume significantly to enjoy your music. You'll still have some minor background noise but the voices of the people next to you is almost unnoticeable unless they're almost screaming.The ambient mode is useful for conversations without taking the earbuds off clear voices from the outside but the background noise and wind will also be heard clearly.Battery life - the case is your salvation.The battery with ANC and with half the volume is around the 4-5h mark and with the case you'll have around 3 additional full charges. So in case you have to go out the whole day they should last with the case easily.The case can be charged wirelessly so that's a plus but it takes a little bit longer to be fully charged.An additional advantage is that you can use each earbud independently so you can use one and keep the other charging in the meantime.Controls - tricky but reliable when you get used to it.They offer a lot of different gestures for different actions and sometimes you may mistouch the earbuds creating a different command than what you were aiming for. They are useful but you need to get used to them fully enjoy all of the control options you have.Bonus: The app is simple to use and it does includes a lot of info from your Skullcandy products.Sorry for any grammar mistakes not my first language.
4,I have always loved skull candy earbuds since I was skating in gight school and honestly forgot about the brand. After having a pair of Samsung headphones and apple Airpods I wasn't really satisfied with both brands so I started searching for another. I remembered my love for skull candy and decided to give them a try. The sound quality is better than I expected but not as great as top of the line like bose or jbl. The touch is very useful simple and reactive. They stay in my ears even through some of my heavier cardio workouts. Also taking phone calls is a dream. Would definitely recommend
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought them as a replacement to lost or stolen Indy ANC XT models whatever that means but they sure aren’t the same as the XT versions . However compaired to the Red EVO model I bought the same day these are great . My model numbers on both pods and the case didn’t match one another or on the app and neither did the serial numbers . One downside major  other Bluetooth devices like my Red Indy Evo models could always interrupt or control these plus my device together . So losing a spare in a pocket wiloosely causes issues . I hate to even describe the odd suspicions the red ones flagged from day one  I was thinking it was allergic reaction to pigment in the plastic but it’s not even exactly shaped the same . Shame too I liked them for the color but these pop way better . Even tho I loose the higher amplification in the ambient to where I could hear threw walls but these are more comfortable .
4,I love them there great awesome sound quality pretty decent noise canceling quite comfortable and stay in your ears very well only thing that is stopping them from five stars is the fact that left earbud doesn't like taking a charge this has been an issue on the original Indy's as well so the fact that they haven't fixed it is quite annoyingAlso wind nosie is quite apparent and untolerable if using an compressed air gun
4,These Indy Fuel three wireless in-ear have good sound and some noise canceling properties. The battery life is very good the only issue is that it is impossible to adjust the volume of each.
5,I got these while on sale (Feb 2022) so the price is well worth it.The sound is really good. Played some Dubstep on them first thing heard all the wubba-wubba sounds very well. Decent bass but I still wish you could boost it. Overall they're very full sounding not "tinny".  The ANC works very well I do NOT understand the negative reviews. Maybe they got a bad set? Skull Candy is good stuff but not premium so I guess it's possible to get a bad pair of buds? Mine work 100% and do their job well. I bought these for work since I deal with loud rattling metal machines all day. These are life savers I would damage my hearing without them. I almost bought a much more expensive pair but I tried these first and I'm so glad I did. But I'll update my review if they break in a month or 2.  I got the Chill Gray ones so they look AWESOME especially with the blue LED blinking every few seconds. Very modern. The app works well. Not a ton of options but I DID do the custom sound level by Audiodo and it makes an actual difference It's not a gimmick. The touch options are nice with these too. Each bud has different controls so It's different from 99% of touch controls on most other ear buds but you get used to it. (I also love the accent of the voice when you change options. Best way to describe it is: a hott boujee british chic LOL!)  My car has a charging pad built in that I never use... until now since these have a wireless charging case. Now they're always charged for work. Love that!  And lastly the comfort. I'm still trying out the different "gels" but all-in-all they're comfortable. Although I can understand the negative reviews about them hurting after a while even with the smallest gels. Hopefully mine don't end up the the negative review section I really like them.
3,These earbuds are ok. I was expecting some decent sound quality but I think my wired headphones for my iPhone are way better. The item came in a neat package with no damage. As you can see in the picture it has different sizes of earbuds to choose from. I tried all and unfortunately they are so uncomfortable to wear. My ears would ache after awhile. Every now and then there is static so not sure if there is malfunction with the earbuds. The noise cancellation is probably the best feature. It really does cancel all background noise for sure. My daughter tried them on as well and she had the same issue- uncomfortable to wear. As much as I would love to like this product I can’t. I’ll have to gift these away. Personally I wouldn’t buy again..
5,best earbuds ive ever own. sound quality as good as my bose with amuch better battery life noise cancelling works fine for me never had this feature before so not able to compare.
3,I ordered these to try out noise canceling i run an open cab dozer at work it gets pretty loud ive had other brands before and they seem to dissappoint these work GREAT when everything is working as it should they shut down outside noise the volume of my music is plenty loud enough but they lack in the simple things after phone calls one ear will cut out all together or worse give me some kind of high pitched frequency while it tries to reconnect (btw they wont reconnect) same goes if you take them out of your ears the only way ive found for a quick fix is to put them back in the box and reconect the bluetooth everything said and done on the review i cant recommend these to a friend but i still use them because when they are working correctly they are great headphones and i waited too long to return them
3,I have bought a couple of the Indy EVO headphones now. This was the first time buying the Indy ANC. Personally not worth it. The noise canceling works well but the sound is bad. One or both of the headphones will cut out for 10-15 seconds after use for about 5 minutes. Sound is like watching a 240p video. Very fuzzy and tinny. ANC drains the battery quickly. Have to charge the headphones multiple times a week. My EVO I only have to charge once every 2-3 weeks.The True Wireless has made no difference to me.
4,Great battery life
3,After a minute or two of connecting the sound pauses for a second. It does the same thing if for some reason I pause the podcast. After playing back the content I've noticed the earbuds resync themselves.It's OK but my very old Beltune wouldn't do any of this at all.Also when I first take them out of the charger the notice telling me "Noise Cancelling ON" is very loud.
5,If they ever needed a person to try these for durability I can say I am that person. I have ran these over dropped them in water used them in the worst of conditions and just over all abused them. They have never failed me. The sound is fantastic the app is great and the fact you can use the tile app thr find them if you drop one and loose one.... well that goes without having to explain. I loose one at least weekly. Don't wait.. buy these.
3,The first pair I bought were great for almost a year. Then they just randomly stopped charging. Warrantied them out for a new set and these ones are absolute junk. About 50% of the time one or both of the buds will malfunction and I'll just get static--which usually resolves after resetting the bud. This is super annoying when you're listening to something and it just happens though. Once these are crap I'll probably not buy another set of skull candy's since they won't warranty replace this defective pair.
4,At first listen I was floored with the strong bass nice midrange and adequate highs. Using it was like having a subwoofer in your ears. Spyro Gyra Rippingtons Special EFX Pat Metheney and others had that lower register slam...even Brain Bromberg's acoustic bass sounded very full and defined. For telephone calls - NOT SO impressive. I was told they could not hear me on the other side or I was cutting off and on so I end up switching to phone speakers to have a decent conversation in the car.Here comes the BUT... I was very intrigued how Skullcandy pull this remarkable device to sound so great. Almost all my earbuds are 90% Skullcandy.... others are B&W Sony and some other cheaper ones.My curiosity got me fired up so I pulled my phone with 3 apps EMF Radiation detector installed. I measured the EMF radiation coming off from the Indy ANC and I was shocked to see the radiation reading climbing from 15 micro-teslas (normal) to as high as 396 micro-teslas...the safe maximum radiation level is about 100 micro-teslas. SUPER HIGH RADIATION coming from the Indy ANC earbuds at almost 4 times the safe level. It is in your ear and almost in your brain.I measured my daughter's Iphone Earpods and they measured at 54 micro-teslas...our wifi router at 26 my laptops at 60 - 70 micro-teslas.I am not sure how this extremely strong radiation will affect your blood cells brain ears eyes over time. I guess we wait for a few years maybe 5 to see if there are any negative impact to the human body.MUSIC REPRODUCTION =  100% / A+  THE BESTTELEPHONE CALLS =  75% / C  NEEDS IMPROVEMENTRADIATION EMISSION=  25% / F  VERY SCARY
5,I have not found the issues with quiality that other reviewers have mentioned and am glad (so far) that I disregarded the negatives and purchased these earbuds. I have put the devices through the paces every day since buying with no problems. The on-bud controls are a little tricky (don't know how that stands up to other brands) but the app that controls them on your phone or tablet is golden. They even adjust the sound output to your specific hearing condition.
5,Bought these for my husband and he loves them. Noise cancelation works really well sometimes to well lol. He had tried other brands and said they hurt after sometime wearing them but these he has had no issue with them in for hours.
4,They have very ice sound quality long lasting battery life easy to use easy to connect great functionality great personalized fit on the ear and they look awesome.Noise canceling is not the best but it works. Case is a little bulky but slick and easy to carry on pockets. They have sometimes issues with the left earbud sounds like a dirty noise for a second and then they sound normal like if it was glitching. But overall they are very nice for the price. They have the functionality or even more than the airpods pro. Maybe they don’t reach the quality as apple but it really doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t pay that much for earbuds anyways.I do recommend if you’re trying to save a bit on your workout earbuds.
5,Lo recomiendo
4,Great sound. Noise cancellation works.They wont stay in my ears.I probably have weird ears.  I need the one with the over ear hook.I mainly use them in my Motorcycle helmet  it keeps them in ok.
4,I'll start by saying these earbuds have some amazing features there is no doubt they are top of the line quality earbuds. The app works wonderfully; the personal sound EQ the integration with Tile the ANC and Ambient Sound features are all great! I can't judge sound quality all that well as I'm coming over from over-the-ear headphones but it's definitely not poor by any means. The Active Noise Cancellation works well but leaves a faint ringing in your ear which is more noticeable when there isn't anything playing through the earbuds (I've never been a fan of noise cancellation personally). The touch controls work well enough but I find them to be a bit finicky especially if you try to adjust the earbuds; you just have to be carful not to touch the sensor or you may accidently change the volume or the song. I gave the product 4 stars because I do believe these are a good product however I personally will be returning them because they do not fit my ears properly. Despite the customizable bud sizes and grommets used to make sure the earbuds stay in place the angle at which they sit in my ear causes them to push up against the front of my ear canal and it really starts to hurt after just a few minutes. I know this will not be everyone's experience as we are all created differently so I do encourage anyone on the fence to try them out; you can always return them :)Edit: I was wearing these completely wrong. I was pushing them into my ears like normal in-ear earbuds but they are supposed to just rest in your ear. It felt a bit strange like they were about to fall out but after a few days it felt normal. There is still a little discomfort with the grommet that pushes up against my ear but it is far far less than when I was wearing them incorrectly. I cancelled my return these are keepers!
4,I was looking for something cheaper than airpods but small enough to fit in my ears and a decent sound quality. That's just what I got. The smallest ear piece to attach to it fits perfectly in my ears. I've left them in my ears for hours and I got no headache or earache because their soft and lightweight. Only thing I didn't like about them is the complexity of the controls. Just to pause one of the earbuds you have to jump spin click your heals and hold down the button on the side two times for two seconds which doesn't always work. If you have your phone with you to control the music the complicated controls on the earbuds aren't a problem.
4,Battery life could be better. Pairs seamlessly great sound quality.
5,I've been dieing to get my hands on these ear buds since I saw them. Well worth the amount and a steal at the price (currently like 80something after tax). I saw the reviews of the app not working for some people but I haven't had issues with it yet and the custom sound profile via the app is just ridiculous (in a good way). The ANC is great couldn't hear anything not even my dad as he was trying to talk to me and he was borderline yelling since I had a blank stare. The ambient noise mode does what it says with pretty good clarity both for what you're listening to and what's going on around you. Got them in the classic all black as with all my skullcandy purchases and the texture on them is great it doesn't feel like they will slip out of your fingers when you grab them. All in all I'd say skullcandy is back to those old days when they were the "to die for" brand for me. Quality ✅️ Clarity ✅️ Ease of use ✅️ 100% would recommend.
4,I love these earbuds!!!The quality for price is excellent in my book.  They fit great after experimenting with various combinations of the included inner/outer earpiece sizes.I only have two complaints:1) RARE: There seems to be random syncing issues where I will lose audio in one or both earbuds very briefly even in environments where I usually have no issue.  Again this is a rare occurrence and it doesnt bother me too much.2) EVERY SINGLE TIME:  I LOVE noise cancelling...when I want it.  The vast majority of time I don't.  If the Skullcandy App can save my hearing profile for individual ear equalization every time I turn them on then they should be able to remember that I want them to start up with noise cancellation off.  Generally speaking for safety and awareness I'd think that would be the default.  Here's my suggested hierarchy on power-on: ANC off (default) ANC on ambient mode.  just sayin.Otherwise these are excellent ear buds.  I recommend them to my friends (ESPECIALLY against Airpods) any time they bring up wanting/needing a replacement.
3,I gave it 3 stars. They have the potential to be really good. I love the app. The noise canceling is really good. A lot of features and gestures that make it very convenient. Why i gave it three stars? The connectivity. When you have both earbuds on one tends to disconnect and connect back and that gets really annoying. I read that it is a very common issue with these earbuds and i kinda regret getting them but oh well. Im gonna have these untill they dont work anymore and get some other brand with better build quality.
4,NA
5,If you've been wanting AirPods Pro but have hesitated due to the extremely high price these are for you!Boom design: Got it!Secure & Comfortable all-day fit: Got it!Active Noice Cancellation: Got it!Ambient / Transparency Mode: Got it!Custom sound with deep bass and rich mids and highs: Got it!Touch Controls: Got it!Easy device switching: Got it!Long battery life: Got it!I'm so stoked on these earphones! I wanted AirPods Pro so badly but I can't justify spending $200 on them. I discovered the Indy line of earphones over the summer and without ANC they just didn't seem compelling enough. I'm glad I waited. The Indy ANC's check nearly every feature box going head-to-head against the AirPods Pro the only exception being Spacial Audio.Connection and Setup was a breeze using the Skullcandy App and the Personal Audio feature is really neat. Basically a hearing test in each ear then based on the results Skullcandy customizes the output from each earbud to make sure you get the absolute best audio experience. It makes a noticeable difference. The fit is very comfortable yet secure with no signs of pressure or other uncomfortableness after hours of wearing them.Noise Cancellation is amazing. I've never had ANC headphones before so I didn't know what to expect. They're extremely effective! I tried them in the car and engine / wind noise went completely silent. I can't wait to travel with them. Ambient / Transparency mode is also very effective and useful. My daughter even said "Daddy you have your earphones in but you're acting like you don't." Meaning I was having a normal conversation with her and my wife and I could hear them perfectly.One of the biggest advantages I've experienced with Apple-branded earphones is one-click / one-tap switching between devices and that's one of my biggest gripes with non-Apple-branded earphones and speakers. I was SO HAPPY this morning when I connected them to my MacBook then one-tapped on my iPhone to connect them to that device then one-clicked them on my MacBook to reconnect. That means I'll be able to connect them to my iPad and my Apple TV and switch between them just as easily. I'm officially in love with the Indy ANC's now!Get these earphones... you'll be as thrilled with them as I am and not even the slightest bit disappointed.
5,Great Product. Amazing
3,Noise canceling is good but not absolute so 4 stars. My main problem is the unsyncing of the headphones from each other also the spotty connection to my phone. Within 5 minutes the left headphone dropped out then came back a few seconds later. Dropout happen all the time now crackling duel sound from the unsyncing. Really frustrating when listening to books all day.Edit. I will be returning these. Probably for the same product. Having charging issues on the 6th day already. I forget what the use time is but without any noise canceling on and only listening to books the pair last an average of 8hrs.
5,Very impressed with sound quality noise cancellation and comfort. They come with multiple size silicone covers to fit just about any ear for extended wear comfort. Also the app lets you tune the sound to your hearing as well use two different noise cancellation modes.
4,I'm satisfied with the product for video calls.  The noise canceling at the mic is excellent.  Sound quality during a call is also excellent.  There are many features but it takes a while to figure out how to tap the earbuds to control them.  Battery life is good.  It is also worth mentioning that when you talk on a call it feels like your ears are plugged but you sound normal to the people on the call.  This is annoying at first but I got over it pretty fast.I wanted to use these as my primary music earbuds as well but they just don't have the solid bass sound that my wired Skull Candy earbuds do.  So if I'm listening to music I usually use the wired earbuds.
5,Understanding that no ear bud is truly 100% noise canceling these are the next best thing. The versatility of their applications are decent enough to the point that I don't use all of them regularly. The quality delivers a robust sound that I've come to enjoy and am probably addicted to by now. The battery charges relatively quickly especially if their charging pod is at full charge. The price is commensurate with the quality.
1,Ok so I'm going to start out with the positives about these buds. These buds are great in sound quality no complaints there making and receiving calls are clear from both ends. Cosmetic wise this looks like air pods and the case are similar in a way case is very compact so it's easy to carry these around and you can even buy a silicone case for it to have it hanging off your clothing. Very comfortable in my ears with various ear pieces you can swap out to fit your needs.....Now for the bad...  For a pair of buds that are worth $129.99 you would expect quality and sound right??? well... This is where the reason for my 1 star review comes in. Ok so to start this off pairing The pairing for this isn't as smooth as you'd like it to go I had difficulties pairing this straight out the box but eventually got them paired up... Now....Day 1 of usage: Right away I was noticing some connectivity issues? Let me elaborate. So yes the buds would be connected but then after a couple mins of usage 1 of the buds wasn't emitting sounds It would be powered on and connected but no sound coming through (This would happen throughout the whole day I've been using them) and this would happen at random times and with either the left or right one going out at random.Day 2: I factory reset the buds and reconnected them in hopes of fixing the issue from the previous day. IT WORKED! All day my buds where working the way they should YAY!Day 3: No problemsDay 4: Issues came back 1 bud will randomly stop emitting sounds unless I put it back in its case and take it back out (Turning it off and on again) buds will work fine for a couple mins and then again.... no sound coming through 1 budDay 5: Issues persist but it has gotten worse my buds will randomly get disconnected and reconnect on it's own in the middle of me jamming (Or attempting to) to my music and then eventually not emitting sounds from either buds OK at this point I tried to connect my other buds that I have in hopes that maybe my phone is the issue? NOPE my other buds are working perfectly fine with no connectivity issues at all. Ok so its the INDY ANCs. Am going to be returning them I guessI have always owned a lot of skullcandy earphones/buds/headsets and not once have I had issues like this before (There's always a first for everything I suppose) Oh and I tried connecting them to the companion app that skullcandy has....it's trash 2.2 Star overall ratings on the app and I see why They connect to the app but the app keeps saying they are disconnected? So I can't do nothing with that.Turns out that this connectivity issue.... more like the no sounds emitting from a bud issue is common on this specific pair of buds? I dunno all I know is either I got a defected one or this really is a common issue but not gana risk it. Just going to go with another option instead.
4,I love these ear buds.  Sound great and the batteries seem to last for days.  I use them every day while walking for about 2 hours a day.  Only need to charge them once a week.  I also love the noise canceling feature!  Now.... here are the two things I don’t like:1) in windy days there is a constant whoooshing sound in them.  And 2) you use all their features by tapping on the right or left ear Bud.  Great in theory BUT they’re very sensitive and if you try to tap them once to change volume and accidentally tap them twice while walking fast or running you instruct them to do something else.  They’re very hard to get used to.  A small remote in your pocket should have made these so much better.  In total there are about 12 commands that you can make with taps and/or holds in right or sometimes left Bud.  Very cumbersome while walking or running.  I still love them but I can only give them four stars because of how you control them.
3,Fundamentally these are great earbuds.  The quality is phenomenal the ambient and noise cancelling modes work well and the microphone is supremely high quality being the one most people claim they prefer out of all the microphones I have.That being said for the "Top of the line" wireless earbud product from Skullcandy I am utterly surprised by the lack of one critical feature present on lesser models: Physical push buttons on the buds themselves.I have a pair of Sesh Evo's and while admittedly lesser noise quality they are significantly easier to utilize the features thanks to the physical push buttons.These Indy headphones rely on a touch-based feature so it's very hard to know when you've touched it properly if you've waited sufficient time between touches per the feature you're trying to activate etc causing regular incorrect mode selections.  I get that they probably did this to save space/conform to the tighter form factor of the earbud but it's moved my otherwise 5 star review down to 3.
4,These were my first pair of wireless earbuds.  I’ve used wired Skullcandy buds for years because they have always been the most comfortable for my small ear canals and are reasonably priced.  Unfortunately even using the smallest tips that were included with this set I can only wear them for an hour or two before having to remove them due to ear pain.  I wear a lot of noise cancelling products for hearing protection at work and at home.  Although these earbuds do a great job at canceling ambient noise sudden close noise or even wind sounds like radio static.  All of my other noise canceling products just instantly quiet the noise with no added sound.Pros:Low profile and look great in the ear.  Reasonable price.  Sound is pretty decent.  Easy to use controls.  Bluetooth range on these is extremely good.Cons:Painful to wear if you have small ear canals.  Noise canceling needs improvement.Summery:I typically get about 4.5 hours of use with noise cancelling on and music playing at a low volume.  Would be great to get 6-8.  Wish there were a smaller sized bud tip to put on.  Phone conversations in areas with minor ambient noise can be a little glitchy but people say they can’t tell I’m not talking through my phone.  If I can find some smaller tips to put on I may edit this review later.
2,As a long time SkullCandy fan I was disappointed in the quality of these. They started off great and then took a down turn after a week. Indy ANC are a good earbud if you get a pair that can hold it together and not start to deteriorate so fast. I had the wireless "Over the ear" skull candy headphones that were amazing until the ear foam fell off a month after warranty ended and I couldn't get it back on which resulted in trying these. I will be returning the INDY ANC and have already ordered the JBL Tour Pro +. When Skull Candy figures out the wireless earbud and the JBL quit working; I will look at trying one of their new models again.Pros: Great sound quality(when working properly) very comfortable after getting the correct combination of fittings awesome battery life.Cons: The Indy ANC have started to act like they have blown speakers after connecting; resulting in returning them to the case and pulling them back out to "reset" them. When they aren't doing this they are halfway working with the tap controls (e.g. not recognizing certain sequences and applying the wrong controls to tap sequences. IMHO they have overloaded the tap control sequences. less is better) ANC automatically comes on when both earbuds are used occasionally the right earbud does not charge in the case.
4,Solid pair of headphones with fair noise canceling.  My issue is noticeable when using a single earbud.  Every now and then the sound will cut out.  I haven’t been able to deliberately replicate the effect so this isn’t the media it’s the hardware.
3,Al abrir la caja no encontré los repuestos de almohadillas tanto para oído como para sujeción.
5,I am really enjoying these headphones. I can't believe how well they work. The battery life is as promised and the user features are also in line with the manufacturer's description. I am exceedingly pleased with the noise cancelling feature. The earbuds sense the background noise and it's like walking into a nearly-sound proof room. Nearly-soundproof is important. when I'm walking or riding I still want to be aware of my surroundings. In the office I like to block out the background chatter.The podcast feature let's me fully enjoy the digital storytelling using only one earbud! In fact I misplaced one of my earbuds for a few days and had no trouble using the remaining one. (I've since reunited the pair.)All in all I'm glad I went for these. They are a must buy and are a good price point for the features available.
4,For taking
3,Bought these after reading glowing reviews on Amazon about the noise cancellation.  Honestly it's just meh.  The only reason I can tell it's on is well A. a voice announces it's on and B. it actually PRODUCES noise when there's nothing to cancel out.  So it's actually louder than it would otherwise be...  When there IS noise (e.g. my furnace) to cancel out it might make a bit of difference but not much.Another slight disappointment is that I noticed a reviewer say you can connect to multiple devices and then use your phone to switch back and forth.  This would be highly desirable to me so I don't have to walk back to say my laptop and manually disconnect in order to listen on my phone.  Sadly this reviewer was mistaken.  No such feature exists.And finally another annoyance: every time I listen I have to reconnect the headphones in the skullcandy app.  Not sure what's up with that.  The headphones still connect to my iPhone automatically but if you want to change settings in the skullcandy app you have to reconnect each time.All this said there are a few redeeming qualities.First the sound quality is actually quite impressive.  I've thoroughly enjoyed it.  Second the earpiece options are nice.  I'm usually pretty picky about this and sensitive to pain building up.  They're not the most comfortable I've had but all around I like them.  Third I like the range of actions you can take just by tapping the headphones.All in all good headphones.  On par with other $60-100 wireless earbuds that DON'T offer ANC.  And that's basically what you're getting.
5,I wish I could tell you from first hand but I can't. My son love his skullcandy earbuds .
5,Worth the money
2,I used these to listen to music and podcasts at work.  They sounded good but constantly had issues with one ear bud not charging. Also these would only register about a third of my taps which was beyond annoying when I had to double tap to pause to talk to co-workers.I was already very disappointed in these and then the icing on the cake was when the left earbud just stopped working 90% of the time.  These are too new for that to happen.Will not buy these again.The only reason for the 2 stars instead of 1 was because of the good sound quality.
5,I bought these after my apple AirPods got stolen and I should have bought these first the ambient sound is pretty good the noise canceling is great and the sound quality is so much better than regular AirPods (maybe not the pros). Overall great product
3,Worked well but did not fit
2,tl;dr: on balance they don’t get a high enough rating for me to keep. If I could replace the ear wings with a style similar to their looped BT Active style that have tapered arc’d wings instead of this awful wedge shape they would be much more functional for me. Along with the poor battery life and glitchy pairing it’s not worth the hassle pain or risk of loss.I bought these from the open-box discount Amazon listing. I did a thorough cleaning of them and also found they still has the previous customer hearing profile stored when I sync’d them with the app. The set was missing one of the large size in-ear gels. No big deal for me since I don’t wear that size. So just be aware if you consider buying open box.On to the actual product…the ear wings hurt like crazy…both sizes…I tried them combined with both full sets of gels I have (Sm & Med). If you are doing any talking (or eating) and they’re not positioned “just right” they WILL and do fall out. The pairing is glitchy. If you pause the music or audio at all one or both starts to crackle or lose connectivity. One or both will lose sound randomly and pop back on…then off again. I have to fiddle with the app or force restart them to get them back to full function. Full charge only shows 95% after indicating they are complete. Only last about 3 hours in ANC mode. Maybe I got a defective pair.Positive points: the app is great! The ANC is also fantastic. When my husband is talking to me in a normal speaking voice while they’re in ANC I absolutely can’t hear him (take what you will from that! Haha). The ambient mode is great too! I feel like I could really enjoy that while walking in the airport or sitting somewhere I don’t want to be totally tuned out.
4,I’ve had these for about a month now and I’ve had no problems. I was hesitant to buy with the bad reviews I had read but I’m glad that I didn’t listen.
5,I’ve always liked Skullcandy as a brand.  Simply because if it’s name.  It’s fresh & innovative.  Now I absolutely LOVE Skullcandy because they not only talk the talk but they walk the walk. With the Indy ANC earbuds Skullcandy delivers a quality product to the market place that proves you do not need to be rich to own earbuds that not only have superior sound but are easy to use have an amazing battery life fit the way they should with functionality that actually works. BUY THESE EARBUDS if you’re in the market for a pair. If not for their quality then the value you’ll get for you money.  SIMPLY THE BEST!
4,If I leave the left bud in the charger then quickly move it to my ear I can hear the ANC kick in (ANC is disabled when using 1 bud). Distant steady sounds like a lawn mower engine almost complete disappear. I've used large landscaper ear protection for a couple decades. And I wore wired earbuds under The Husky tractor I cut with doesn't get blocked as well as my ear muffs but it's blocked pretty well and I don't need to increase the volume much when the engine starts.NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - The button tapping doesn't respond well enough. I often have to attempt double tapping 3-4 times to start\stop. ...No I don't have trouble tapping on any other electronics.They're pretty comfortable. I replaced the medium sized rubber earbud with a small one because I felt a little pressure in my dumb small earhole.I scored based on current available options on the market as of May 2021.
4,Originally thought it was user error struggles to get it to work. Turns out the product they sent me was defective. Put a ticket in and they sent me a new pair that actually works. All and all product works amazingly. Would give it a 5 out of 5 if it was not for the defective one.
3,I purchased these earbuds a little over 1 month ago.  They are really nice earbudscomfortable and great sound quality.  However one of the rubber lift rings forremoving them from the charger broke along the bottom edge making it difficultto remove from the charger.  Skullcandy customer service responded with a generic replyinforming me spare parts are not available at this time.  Seems to be a "fire and forget"approach to customer service.
5,Purchased as a gift. Recipient was happy.
5,Highly recommend.
3,I bought these in hope they didn't have light static with the NC activated.You can still hear it in these ones.
5,These headphones sound very good and come with a load of features.  They have active noise cancelling that works reasonably well but not total noise cancelling.  You can set up a personal sound profile with the app.  It plays different tones in each earbud to set the equalizer to your ears. These also work with the Tile app so you can find your lost earbuds.  This isn't perfect but it can certainly be helpful.  You get USB C as well as wireless charging for the case.  Battery life on the earbuds isn't the best but it is pretty good and with the case you can recharge the earbuds again and again.  Overall these are good quality earbuds that will suit just about anyone.
2,My son bought this for himself and they immediately had mixed feelings about them. The material they’re made out of feels cheap and not durable for the price range and the right earbud won’t stay connected and keeps cutting in and out. Other than that the fit and sound with the custom EQ are great but means nothing if you can’t listen to anything without one ear bud cutting in and out all the time.
4,I was skeptical at first but they are great headphones with amazing sound. If I really want to jam out I use my headphones over my surround sound. You can personalize the sound which makes it wayyyy better. It's simple download the app and there's a way to set it up. You listen for different tones and it creates an audio profile just for you! They're expensive but worth it for the perks. Wireless charging is very cool and you can use any bud solo.
1,As with many others giving this product a rave review I too love(d) these things. That is until it came time for SC to honor their warranty/replacement. Without going into endless blathering about how companies exist to make money I entered into this relationship with the understanding that the warranty replacement of 2 years integration with the TILE platform and available parts and accessories would cover me in just about every category in terms of faulty/failed hardware lost component and if needed buy replacement parts if/when the time came.Anyway I bought them in Feb '21 and used them for airline travel. As my luck would have it I misplaced the charging case (pretty sure it fell out of my pocket while on a flight from NH to NC). Anyway with the TILE feature I figured it would be OK...I'd locate it and ask a flight attendant to retrieve it. Nope. The TILE function only applies to the earbuds themselves (which I had in my ears at the time of deplaning). No biggie I'll just reach out the SC and buy a replacement case. NOPE. "I'm sorry we don't sell replacement parts for that model". In spite of this they offered me a 40% discount to use on a new purchase. Welp on the surface that sounds great but when you read the fine print (ah that fine print that nobody ever reads) the discount only applies on SC's web site AND cannot be combined with any other offer sale or discount. So I visit the site and see these earbuds are "on sale" for yep you guessed it $80 which is BTW 38% off MSRP. I visit AMZ's site to experience what they might cost me and whoa they too are selling them for $80. In the end I paid full price ($130) back in Feb and now I'm being offered a 40% discount off MSRP and have to pay shipping if I buy them from SC directly yet if I buy the same ones on AMZ for $80 and get free shipping (and get them tomorrow if I so choose). So basically the TILE integration failed me replacement parts offering failed me and SC's supposed "customer service" failed me (by offering me a discount that is anything but a discount).TL;DRIf you're looking for $80 to spend on a decent set of earbuds these work great (although their suggested  battery life is a "stretch"). However if you're into these earbuds for the TILE integration replacement parts availability and a company who stands behind their product (hardware innovation support and customer service) look elsewhere.
4,Very good sound and the noise canceling is amazing. When it comes to the sounds themselves these will be amazing for you. The only problem I have with them is them being a little to bulky for my ears at times. The case is very plasticy and honestly feels cheap so if you’re like me and used to the AirPods you will be left wanting more there. But when it comes down to doing their job they are easily the best especially for their price range.
5,Cant say how long the battery lasts for just got them. Have had them for a few days.
3,Love me some Skullcandys and after losing my last pair I decided to step up to ANC. Gotta say I was kinda let down my last pair didnt have ANC but I feel it did a better job of blocking out the sound. Also when the ANC is on it makes the audio sound off and any sound that does get through is even more annoying i.e. my coworkers chewing!
3,Does not link easy to iPhone or iPad. Takes many tries sometimes.  Left ear drops like others have complained. Sound when it works is great.
4,A bit heavy
4,Works well but keep directions on hand cuz mine keep only letting one or the other work. I have to keep removing and resetting them for both to work together. Other than that they work fine.
5,Muy buenos
4,Great
3,The disappointing part is the audio gets distorted and starts glitching and you have to keep restarting them. Not a huge deal but sort of sucks. I don’t know if $70 for them is fair or not but I wish they could fix this. Plus oddly enough…. The right one dies faster than the left one which is annoying. Mix feeling about them. These don’t compare to the classic corded Ones from Skull Candy.Noise cancelling is great before is starts glitching and sound quality is good.
4,These work fairly well. Noise cancelling works great. They have a tendency to cut in and out while on the phone or watching videos which is why I gave them 4 stars
5,Great sound and great battery life! I was gifted these and loved them so much I bought a set for my sister for her birthday! No regrets.
4,Great quality arrived early love.It has a lot of connectivity issues when i'm jogging or even walking some times.But Overall and for the price is a good product
5,These buds are tight fitting so they stay in nice. The sound is full good highs & lows. For the price point they are awesome!
5,I bought one and in a few months the left bud stopped working and wouldnt charge. I requested a replacement. I got a new one and guess what now this left bud won't work and also won't charge. Of course I can't ask for a replacement but I already received one but neither worked right. Junk.
4,It's great if you like your music with heavy bass but if you prefer to listen to more balanced music this may not be for you. You have a choice of Music/Movie modes which = Heavy Bass or Podcast Mode = No Bass
1,I'm not an audiophile but I like music and I know when something sounds off.  These sound great and work as expected.  Battery life is good with the case and quick charging.  I also like that the case wirelessly charges.  I am generally a big fan of Skullcandy devices.  For the price you get a decent bang for your buck from these headphones.  Unfortunately there are a few flaws that keep these from deserving 5 stars.1. They only come with two sizes of ear wing tips (the little pieces to hold them in your ears).  And neither size is big enough for my ears... So I wish they had one size larger... They occasionally fall out because of this.2. The noise cancellation isn't especially great.  I had a pair of Taotronics $25 headphones that had slightly better noise cancellation.  The Skullcandy ANC is adequate but I do wish it was better.3. The app doesn't have an option to turn on an auto-sleep mode for the earbuds.  I like to fall asleep listening to music or books and I have had headphones that would go into a power save mode  after minutes of no audio being played.  These don't do that but I sure wish they did.Update: Unfortunately I had to knock another star off... I've had these for not quite a year now and the left earbud just stopped working entirely.  They do have a 2 year warranty so it should be covered under that but it's still frustrating to have a product not work.Update 2: I got a replacement pair under warranty a few months back and that set almost immediately had issues staying synced to my phone... so I sent it back and got another pair that seemed to work fine.  Now I am noticing that the wireless charging doesn't work... probably never has worked since I got them.  So I am on my 2nd replacement pair and it has issues so I'll be sending in for a 3rd replacement (meaning I have had 4 pairs total in under a year's time).  Their warranty is decent but the process of sending them in and waiting for a replacement is obnoxious.  It's especially tedious that this many pairs have had issues.  I won't be buying another Skullcandy product which is rather unfortunate.  These guys used to make decent products.  I used to exclusively buy their headphones.
5,Tengo 3 días usándolos y me parecen excelentes sonido increíble característico de SC y los audífonos robustos la cancelación de ruido bastante buena.
2,I'm not a fan of the "tap" instead of a button. It says to tap once for up and once for down (respectively for right and left buds) and double tap either bud to play or stop media. Half the time I have to get my phone and push play on the phone and if I'm trying to stop the playback to speak with someone I try tapping but usually it's not quickly enough so I remove the bud and eventually go back to where I left the book playing. Extremely frustrating. Ok complaining aside the sound quality is impressive and surprisingly the noise canceling works really well.
3,Left ear bud basically works when it wants to 90% of the time it does not work at all.
3,I dislike the ear buds disconnecting during my workout. So annoying
5,Was a little hesitant at first having bought skullcandy headphones in the past they never seemed to be very durable but that being with old wired models. I decided to give skullcandy the benefit of the doubt in purchasing these due to ANC feature sweat/water resistance and true wireless design. However I was surprised to find out there is also an app to download and pair with your earphones which customizes your listening experience which was quite nice actually.The charging case is sleek and small and is USB-C. I'm not sure that you can use it as a battery to charge other devices but i don't really care since I don't believe I have ever actually used that feature on any of my other wireless headphone charging cases..My only complaint is the bass doesn't seem quite as deep at times as i'd like but thats to be expected with these type of buds. Overall the Sound quality is excellent and they're perfect for daily activity or workout!
3,If you have trouble with earbuds staying in these most likely won't work for you. I have small ears and have a hard time finding earbuds that will stay in. I wanted a pair I could sit at my desk and take calls with. After reading reviews and changing the rubber pieces to the smallest option still no luck. Without even moving they would just fall out.Pros: Sound quality is good (I wouldn't say excellent).They are easy to pair with any deviceQuick charge timeCons: as notesd can only pair with one device at a timeDon't stay in ear very well
5,Got this after i lost another set of ear buds since these have tile support .  sound good feel good. only down side the tile make  a noise is really really soft
3,Blueetooth gives you points. Other than that audio is not thst good and in less than a year I am having problems with the left side (barely used them since there was always an issue with them that I prefer not to deal). If you find them cheap is okay however for 60+ you can try something else.
5,These are fantastic little earbuds. I have a hard time finding earbuds that fit comfortably but these do the job and sound great too.
3,Second time buying these. The first time I bought them used and they were great!! I lost one of the buds so I purchased it new.The connection is very week when I’m at the gym. It’s staticky sometimes or will go out. Other than that.. great battery! I can charge these things once a week and be good! Great distance… I’ve gone out my apartment and can still hear my music and the ANC works! I’ve been in a crowded store and heard NOTHING but my podcast.
2,I've had these for a week or so and I'm going to return them. They connect to my phone easily enough but after that it's rare that both left and right pods are working. Maybe ten minutes out of every hour. The left may be working fine for five minutes then it will cut out and the right will start working. That's the pattern for as long as I've been using them.On top of that when watching a streaming show the audio is delayed by almost a second.
5,I bought these for myselfI am pleased. Turned around and got a set for my husband and son. They both like them. My husband one complaint is the ambient modehe does not like that.
4,The Bois cancellation feature is nothing special if that's what you are looking for as a primary deciding factor then theae aren't for you.Sound quality is decently above average you can hear all ranges clearly from deep defined bass to high pitches.Battery life is as advertised for hours per full charge with Active Noise Cancellation turned on.Controls are super Intuitive.You are definitely getting more than your money's worth with this model.
3,They worked fine for a while but were consistently skipping on any device I used. Specifically when I used them on my computer the audio would be delayed most noticeable when watching a movie. The app to actually use most of the features consistently is so poorly optimized I had to disconnect them from the app each time I wanted to use them. The noise cancelling and sound quality are done well but they are lacking in bass slightly and the left one started to sound tinny after a bit.
3,OK so I really like these earbuds but there’s a huge issue with them and I am not alone. They are constantly disconnecting from Bluetooth and only one earbud stays connected. I have only managed to fix the issue once in the months I have had these the rest of the time I have been listening to my media on one ear only. I looked up the issue online and tons of people complain about the same problem. Other than that these earbuds fit really well and do not fall out while exercising. Just wish they would stay connected.
5,I read over 40 reviews and was a little worried that fitment would be an issue but not at all!  Fits great stays put sounds great.  Battery life could be longer but as long as the base is charged you could go 10 hours with a minimal interruption.  I use only one ear 90% of the time so all day is not an issue.  I do have large ears and found fitment perfect with the silicon adapters they have!
1,The earphones have plenty of issues but for the price it seems fair. The first issue is the controls. The controls are sensitive and it is hard to get used to. The connection needs improvement drastically. The earbuds audio will cut off randomly even with it being less than 1 feet away. The last thing is they start to fall off with a bit of sweat.Edit: I given it 1 star review due to the issue I had with Skullcandy the company. I sent a warranty claim to see if what they can do about the earbud's issues. They said I had to send it to them in order to start the warranty claim. I paid for shipping (nonrefundable) to their warranty center.After a few days I received an email with the following: Our Claims Center has received your warranty return. Unfortunately is no longer in stock. Instead we’ve created a coupon for $XX. The only thing in stock is about 20 dollars cheaper than the earbuds listed here. Also the coupon is only for a one-time use.I called customer service and after talking with them I am now getting the same earbuds. The whole transaction cost me more than what I paid since I paid for a nonrefundable shipping fee to Skullcandy which I assumed was going to fix the issue. If I would have taken the coupon they offered I would have lost even more.
3,Battery life only lasts about 3 hours then you have to charge em. I work 12 hour shifts and its annoying gotta charge em every 3 hours for an hour would not buy these again.
5,They work pretty well but I'm having trouble with one side disconnecting on and off. The battery life is average maybe three hours or so definitely not what they say they will do. Somewhat satisfied but not that great
2,I’ve had a pair of these for the last five months and initially got them because of the glowing reviews I saw on Amazon it ended up being the worst purchase I’ve ever made for earbuds/headphones.Sound: greatBattery life: pretty goodReliability: terribleThe entire time I’ve had these either one or both earbuds would randomly lose connection on just about every listen. It has been a constant issue that has made what would otherwise be a decent $130 earbud worse than the $30 wireless ones I replaced with them.Now I’ve had an issue where one of the charging plugs doesn’t seem to be making contact with one of the earbuds even after I’ve cleared them (there was absolutely no reason for it to be dirty enough to block the connection in the first place so I’m still puzzled as to how this started).Put all this together with the fact that the secondary rubber piece that serves as a handle to take them out of the case is pretty finicky and can easily slip out of place which is just enough to push the earbud away from a tight fit in the charger means regardless of the battery life of the charger the earbuds themselves have a hard time maintaining a full charge when put away.Bottom line: sound quality matters little when the earbuds only work half the time. HUGE disappointment for the amount of money. Just poor design in general.
2,I’m Comparing these to AirPods Pro.Pros- They sound better than the AirPods and they have more controls built directly into the buds which is pretty convenient. That’s about it.Cons-•that multitude of wonderful controls is narrated by an obnoxious voice. (Noise canceling on. Noise canceling off. Ambient mode. Connected. Disconnect. Power on. Power off) she never stops talking.•Active noice canceling and ambient mode are weak at best AND•There’s something wrong with the coding for each setting. Every other track plays with static so you have to turn off the noise canceling (which is defaulted as ON) to make the crackling go away.• Connectivity is an issue. They’re slow to connect to iPhone and sometimes fail to connect at all so you have to put them away and take them out of the case again. Once you have the connection established there’s no guarantee there either. Audio cuts out repeatedly if you do something like put your phone in your pocket.•phone calls suck. But all buds have trouble with that in my experience.Conclusion- I think I left these in my friends car the other day and I don’t care if I get them back. I plugged in my AirPods again and I’m happy with it even if I got the right one wet and it buzzes when I run and the case doesn’t hold a charge anymore. Still better than the INDY ANC. (Kanye shrug)Hope this helps.
4,These headphones are absolutely amazing. The sound the connectivity the convenience. All wonderful. However under no circumstance should you connect these to tile with the built in tracking. I didn't know if it was a fluke but I returned these before because I thought my headphones were just a bad pair and my next set worked perfectly fine. Until I connected it to tile. I hadn't connected these to tile until a week later. My first pair I connected immediately. Both pairs while connected to tile cause the headphones to not connect to any Bluetooth device without unpairing and repairing every use. The volume was wonky and they died within minutes no matter how long the charge.
3,After a while not sure if the Bluetooth stops working or what but I'll have my phone on me in the gym and the music to one or both of my headphones will cutt off for a few seconds then cut back on. This will happen a few times during a 1 hr period of time.
2,I’ve had other Skull Candy ear buds I’ve loved but these do not even come close to being as good. The left bud keeps going in and out with the sound while I’m using it. Very annoying. And the person on the other line can’t understand me through the earbuds when I use them for calls (I take them out and hold my phone to my ear and they can understand me just fine).  Overall do not recommend at all.
5,Comes with w good warranty. The case and the earbuds are well constructed.  They come with extra tips for different size ears which is awesome.  I use the large tips and they fit snug like a glove even when working out 😄 pumping iron non-issue!  Sound quality I unreal for the price .  Battery life is top-tier.  Seriously active noise canceling works awesome also ambient mode and off in general.  Overall these are great! I'd prefer the greys ! Ahh
3,Great sound fits good and holds charge for workouts all week. Random interference occurs usually at least once every time I use them. I also don't like that if you pull 1 ear bud out to talk to someone it automatically pauses music and you have to restart ear bud to get it to connect and play again.
2,The small rubber pieces hurt the ears after having them on for extended periods of time. Also they randomly disconnect or you can hear interruptions while listening to audio. Sometimes they become unresponsive and the only way to fix it is to put it back in the case. I prefer the sesh Evo over this garbage honestly
4,The noise cancelation is ok nothing crazy. Sound is much better than my older and cheaper Skullcandy earbuds. I also have some Sesh Evo buds and these ones are definitely better.Calls are good. Haven't had any complaints about people not hearing me well.Unfortunately the stability gels are horrible for my ears. Even the smaller ones cause me pain. My ears are too small. The Sesh are much more comfortable for me. So imo they should include more sets of stability gels. Or have options to buy smaller ones. I've worn them without the gels and they slip out a bit. I ended up cutting a part from the top of the gel and that helped a bit.
5,El sonido en lo particular es tal cuál lo descrito y lo que ofrece es lo que esperaba.
4,These have great soundnoise cancellation and comfort. The reason for the 4 stars is one side dose not charge as well as the other and cuts out every once in a wile.
2,The headphones fit nicely they are loud and they last long. The Bluetooth connectivity is absolutely horrible. I’ve bought $20 headphones with better Bluetooth. It cuts out ALL the time even if I just put my phone below the lifting bench it will cut out.
3,So far they seem great the rest of my family use airpods and hate them. I let them try these on and they hate their airpods even more. Have yet to see about battery life I intent to leave anc on since I plan to use these when I ride my bike. So far anc works great when I can manage to keep them in my ears. These actually don't fit me. I was hoping that the small ear silicone tips were as small as the ones that came with the ink'd headphones since those seem to be the only ones that fit my ears correctly but they don't. Damn I wish they still made those. - ok so I managed to find out that the fit is better when you put them in and twist them with the little peg towards the face not bad after figuring that out. On the other hand flicking on the personal sound makes static and all sorts of weird pausing and hiccuping to happen.
1,I feel like this is pretty typical of Skullcandy: you're paying for style over substance. These earbuds aren't that bad: comfortable battery life as advertised decent sound quality. I think they're worth the $50 I paid for them on black Friday; I think the regular retail price is exorbitant.They get one star from me entirely due to the awful case. First off the case is rounded everywhere. It doesn't stand upright (earbuds oriented vertically top hinging up and away from you) it only lies flat on its back (top hinge down battery meter up) or on its front (hinge up meter down). I dislike this because 1) it means the case won't sit open because it will fall over and 2) it actually makes it have a larger footprint sitting on a surface. I feel like it wouldn't have been that hard to flatten the bottom.Second the damn buds don't fit in the case. They come with two sets of stability gels (large and small) and with either set on closing the lid pushes the earbuds out of place with the charging contacts. I think removing the gels would remedy this but it's not a feature if using it interferes with the functioning of the product. On top of that the right bud only charged if pushed firmly into the case and would only keep charging if the case was kept open. Which it can't do on its own because it's all rounded.Third while I say the battery life is as advertised I feel like six hours max with no type of ANC or anything on a $100 pair of buds is pretty poor. I have a pair of Anker soundcore buds that I've had for a couple years paid $80 for and still get a bit over seven hours per charge.Skullcandy: premium price for a budget product.
5,Needed an airpod alternative for my bike rides and these seem to fit the bill. Been using Skullcandy for years and as I know their quality hasn't always been the best over the years they do seem to learn from their manufacturing flaws. My Ink'd 2.0's seem to be holding up for the past 2 years now compared to them breaking over the course of just a few months.As for these I hadn't had any pairing issues like others seem to have. At first I did the left ear bud disconnected right out of the package and just assumed they needed a charge. Left them to charge followed the instructions and hadn't had a problem since. I will edit this review if they end up being a pile of crap in a few months.
3,The left earbud broke after a couple of uses perhaps think about spending I little more money for some AirPods
5,These headphones battery life is pretty insane will last a whole 9 house shift plus some I enjoyed these so far.
5,Battery life is a little less than stated. Other than that these are great fir the price point.
5,Skullcandy ear buds put out some great bass!  I’ve owned many types of earbuds and these stay in my ears have noise cancelling capability super comfortable and my Tragus (ear opening flap) are pieced.  So comfortable this is my second purchase (only because I lost the charging case to the first pair purchased). Would totally recommend this item to anyone.  Great value for the price!
3,Ear buds will not charge past 95% 97%
1,I've gone through 3 pairs of these.. 2 through Walmart 1 through Amazon.The first pair worked alright for about 5 charges and then mysteriously died but I loved them so I went on a quest.The second was working just fine for three times of charging. The fourth time I didn't have the charger that came with it so I used my phone cable which was technically the same cable but they didn't charge. Okay fine. So i waited until I got home and they wouldn't charge even on their own line. Just completely dead.The third pair I've made sure to use only their own cable and have used them sparingly.. but the left ear bud has died after just over a month of use. At first it round say "connected" then cut out but now it just flashes slightly and won't say anything. The right one still works and when the left dead earbud is in will activate the noise canceling feature as if the other is functional. Still have half a pair after buying three. Highly disappointed with myself and this product.
1,Update: Second time it fails in less than a year. One of the earbuds stopped charging for no apparent reason - both times. About to return for a third pair.The cons:The ANC is terrible. It amplifies wind noise when you are outside.Ambient mode is not very useful either. Again it amplifies wind noise.The mic is bad as well. Any time I try to have a phone call using these earbuds I hear complaints about my voice sounding muffled.Last after approximately 6 months one of my earbuds stopped working. I keep them clean and everything looks like new… I only use them when I work out since they are bad at everything else. I had to ship them back and hope the warranty covers it. I own several skullcandy headphones and this is the first time I am deeply disappointed with one of their products. Definitely not worth the cost.A few more details:I like to use this earbuds when I ride my bike outside and both ambient and ANC amplify the wind noise and make both modes unbearable. I own a Sony WH-1000X M3 (ANC) headphone and these do not perform anywhere near on either ANC or Ambient modes. That being said turning off ANC and ambient mode makes this earbuds okay. They block a lot of noise (passively). They also hold to my ear really well even while hitting bumps on a bike at +15mph. Never had an issue with that regard. Battery life is a bit of an issue if you are using ANC but since I never use it my battery life is never an issue.I do like the personal noise feature to create your own equalizer and the integration with Tile to help find your earbuds if they go missing.
5,Update: I had to ship the earphones back to Skullcandy and hopefully the new pair will not have issues. But besides the fact this seller has nothing to do with Skullcandy he/she was very helpful and responded super quick.Great quality earphones! but man it is so annoying one pair acting weird disconnecting making weird noises it’s been frustrating to use. No castle in returning them back to the Skullcandy but I had to pay for the shipping which was like $6 with usps.
1,Right out of the box after I paired the earphones I noticed they were out of charge and the music kept getting interrupted. I thought that was odd since I had bought these exact ones before (not through amazon). After charging it using both a wireless charger and the cable provided (even using the wireless and cable methods provided with my old ones) the LEDs on the case would not turn on unless it was plugged in.The earbuds kept discharging as they would not power off inside the case - nor were they being charged.The build cable and buds themselves also felt like a cheaper plastic different to the ones I bought at the start of this year from Costco even though they were the exact same model and color. Those were lost and I wanted to replace them but sadly nothing worked I tried all the troubleshooting possible. Do not buy these you're better off going to a store or ordering some where else. Returning is such a hassle.
3,The sound quality is on par with all skullcandy earbuds (which is good). The noise cancellation is less than adequate. I can hear a noticeable difference but I can also hear plenty of outside noise if I've got my music on a medium/lower volume. As for comfort the buts that are supposed to help you get the buds out of the case are uncomfortable. I had to switch them to the smaller extra ones they gave but even those hurt my ears. The touch controls are useless and annoying if I'm laying down or accidently touch my earbud randomly. Totally not worth the extra money for the touch control.And lastly for some reason the buds like to cut out and sometimes even disconnect themselves randomly at least once every time I turn them on. Its annoying to say the least but not unbearable since after a few seconds the music comes back.Tldr; go for the cheaper ones
4,Very comfy!!! Sound quality is ok… love the different listening modes. Wish the bass was deeper though
4,Sound great noise canceling is impressive easy connectivity.
3,Had to return them because they were painful. Sounds great but I guess my ears are too small for them. Couldn't wear them for more that 15m at a time.
3,The USB shown as an “included component” isn’t what was in the box. What we got wasn’t compatible with any of our USB chargers and we had to go buy a charger.
4,I loved these so much and I really wanted to keep them but they really hurt my ears because they were too big. Great sound quality great for work calls or zoom calls. I would recommend to anyone who does not have a problem with ear buds hurting their ears.
5,I love these earbuds. Sound quality is great just remember to set them up through the skullcandy app so they can adjust to you. Noise cancelling is a bit gimmicky. They block alot of noise as is as so overall still great for blocking out noise. There are definitely times when I notice it working... Better than nothing. My only frame of reference is the airpod pros ANC and it blows these away. Bass isnt overbearing like some people have said about other skullcandy products. Wireless charging works great and I love the case. Controls take some getting used to but once you get it they're fine. The ambient mode is very useful on runs or in the gym when people want to talk.Overall very satisfied for $90
5,I had the first Gen style of these headphones and everything that I wanted was put into these headphones. Being able to use each one independently the wireless charging of the case noise canceling and the app that customized the sound levels for each ear are great. All the rubber pieces are snug and don't slip off easy so you won't lose them. The touch feature also isn't as sensitive as before so it allows you to adjust the headphone in your ears without accidentally turning them off turning the volume up or down and accidentally skipping a song you're listening to. Will definitely buy another set if these are lost or broken.
2,They cut in and out a lot while mowing or at work
5,Skull candy continue to show up BEATs.They sound good & clear & I think I get minds to last up to 8-12hrs.Cons:The initial pairing & phone free controls can be difficult to understand at first.Bass is not that heavy; yet I believe they can be Tuned via SK App.Noise Canceling works almost Too Good the budz aren't super loud but even so on half volume it's sorta hard to Hear your surroundings.Overall I'm satisfied.
5,These were a upgrade from the indy evos and they are absolutely amazing. The sound quality you get with these rival the top brands easily. The active noise canceling is a added bonus and it works to a degree. I've used these for work everyday and with charging them on my break I haven't had any issues with battery life.
5,The earbuds have great sound and are lightweight. Overall a good product but there are times when they need to be re-paired with each other. The Skull Candy website helped me to do so. A happy listener now!
3,Sound quality is below avg the right ear bud is weaker than the right which is a common issue. Noise canceling is fine does a good job blocking distractions but is not isolating. You  can easily hear cars and people with active listening on. Battery life is fine for my uses however ANC will drain it quickly  Currently will only use while on the move: running walking and air travel
1,It Sept 26th 2022 I purchased these in July 2022At first they were nice and loud Within a week however they were no longer loud enough to completely cancel out the noise at the gym from in house music HIIT zone etc.Additionally they are constantly plagued with interference noise dropouts and returns... Occassionally I'd have to return them to their case to reset them and get them to work again.Today at the gym the right earbud just quit working completely and will not come back despite putting it into the case the charge indicator light doesnt even come on anymore (contacts are clean and never gave a low battery warning)
4,Really cool that you can use these independently from one another. Can listen to music all day because of this. Sound quality is A1 especially when noise canceling feature is enabled. Only thing that I dislike about the product is the rubber part or the earphone sometimes comes loose and have to readjust. Other than that I would highly recommend.
5,The earbuds are great! Sound nice and the battery lasts!
4,Although my left ear bud seems lower in Volume now. They are a good pair of head phones
1,When it works it is a good product. Music and calls are OK. In a quiet environment performs well. I used this a lot while working from home.But from day 0 I noticed that the buds were eventually not charging. One bud or the other does not charge when put into the case probably due to a faulty connector. Today this situation is permanent with the left earbud. Now I have learned that the return procedure with the manufacturer is entirely on my own. I have to ship the product at my own expense to California. I might end up buying new ones from another vendor.
5,I like how loud they are I find that alot of wireless headphones are not very loud (I like to jam out so if I'm hard of hearing later in life so be it) the personalized sound and noise canceling are great and they fit comfortably especially if your working out or wearing them for long car rides
3,I've rated these as 3 because of the annoying blue light that blinks while taking call. It lights up my entire ear. This looks really bad on a video call and everyone that I've been on a call with has mentioned it being annoying. Everything else is great the noise cancellation is decent sound quality is good battery life is good and it sits really well in my ear. If only there was a way to disable these lights it would have been a good purchase.
5,Great product I always recommend skull candy to everyone! I do wish these headphones would play music as loud as the wire connected headphones. However I am still really impressed with the noise cancelling I travel and fly a lot so for that I highly recommend these!
1,The ear buds seem like a great option in the market for the price point however my experience was not the greatest. Specs are almost everything I was looking for but the overall quality of the earbuds is what dragged me down.The earbuds won't fall off. This is a great feature specially if your goal is to use them during work outs (which is my case) however it also caused me a lot of pain. This is a very personal issue as everyone has different ear shapes and it may not be the case for you but it was for me. I could place the buds in and go about my day but after 10-15 min of usage I experienced a lot of pain to the point that removing the buds was also painful. This was true for both ears.The audio quality is really low. I can't stand when the connection fails and you only hear sound on one side of the buds and you get interference noise on the other. Just a huge no.Battery was the best thing it had. It held up the charge pretty well and the case is incredible compared to the competition. I loved I could charge it wirelessly or with a cable and that I could charge one bud at a time if I wanted to.The buds have a lot going on for them but there are many things still to improve. Comfort sound quality and connection is the biggest for me. I ended up returning it.
5,easy to use
2,I'm actually disappointed with Skullcandy with these. All I use are skullcandy earbuds/headphones. I'm using these with my Samsung galaxy s20 and connectivity keeps going in and out and my phone is in my pocket. Yes I changed my setting around on my Bluetooth setting to accommodate for its specs. Yes the earbuds are up to date all my music is high quality videos I watch are too. One would go out and come back in with a delay behind the other. I've have to sometimes disconnect and reconnect to get it to work right. Don't get me wrong when there not acting up it's very good earbuds. Quality of sound bass & treble is good when working right. I don't know maybe because this is Skullcandy's first Gen ANC true wireless earbuds. If it is they need to fix this. I will be sticking to my Skullcandy Wireless Crusher at this point.
5,I am in so much in love with these! And glad my fiance got them when there was a deal!Sound is amazing!They fit perfectly!Fast charging!Easy set up!Love love LOVE Skullcandy products. I have a green/black pair I've had since high school (2004-2006) and they were still doing great! My cat got to them tho so the wires are exposed and are taped up with plumbers white tape hahaha 😆 gotta love cats and cords lolI'm happy to finally have ear buds for my new job and no worries about the wire/cords
4,The noice cancellation works well until you pause and unpause a video or swipe up and then it will crackle and static.
4,They started out great compared to the last model. But lately they have be6 dropping connect staticking. Don't know why but about 3 weeks in use is about when they started glitching. I use them everyday at work but when those problems start it gets annoying. I also have to put them in the case again to try and activate them again.
3,Always have linking issues The app is a waste of space Sounds ok and fit is pretty good
3,When they're functioning properly they're great.. But this is my second pair of skullcandy earbuds (first the Indy Fuel and now the Indy ANC) that has had debilitating earbud charging issues where an earbud doesn't stay connected properly (doesn't seat well) in the case and the earbud battery drains so when I go to use them the batteries are dead.
5,Honestly these things rock. A lot better than I expected. The bad reviews must be either faulty equipment or operater error.
2,So they're decent EXCEPT with 2 different units I have issues with the 2nd earbud removed from the case being distorted & delayed. Eventually I can get it to workoit but this shouldn't be happening. I've reset them multiple times with no solution other than to return them for my money back.
1,The headphones are great. Sound quality but the one thing I can’t get over is how to operate the headphones. Double tap to pause. On tap to raise the volume. Or the opposite side to lower the volume. I still can’t get it to skip the song or go back to a previous one. I’m a mechanic and I listen to music constantly. My hands aren’t the cleanest when you’re elbow deep in an engine. The simplicity of just taping it twice to skip a song instead of hitting it twice and holding it or whatever it is is just not happening especially with dirty hands. If you’re constantly on your phone where you can skip through your phone then these are for you. If you’re in the field of anything manual work these aren’t the ones for us. I went back to my Samsung ones. Pretty disappointed skull candy.
5,These buds blew my mind. They are comfortable and easy to use. They can be used one at a time either left or right or can be used in stereo. Noise cancellation is phenomenal. I hadn't expected such good results on bud-sized packages with great battery life. Audio quality is pretty decent. Perhaps not as good as headsets with larger drivers but the bass is powerful enough without quality being muddied in the mids. Pretty amazing within itself.
2,Had 2 pair first one worked flawlessly for 3 years so bought a second one and it constantly sounds cutting out
5,Worked well enough that when I misplaced my earbuds I repurchased the same model!  The price point doesn't kill you.  Very reasonable for what you get.
4,I love this sound and quality of the headphone but i have one issue sometimes i lose calls on them where i do t on the actual phone.
4,These have a great sound quality and noise canceling. However I think my ears are just too small because even with the smallest bud size after just a few minutes they push themselves out (this doesn’t happen to my spouse who I made put them in and test it). This seems to always be an issue for me and I’m still on my search to find some that will stay in my ear.
4,Love the noise cancelling. Bass could be deeper. Right ear bud will not turn on or charge after 3 months. Mostly I only use the left ear bud not sure if this caused the problem.
5,I got these headphones after debating getting getting slightly cheaper ones but these are well worth the extra $20. The noise canceling is amazing for plane rides. The engine drone turns into a white static noise that isn't obtrusive to music or movies.They are comfortable and have a great battery life. Not to mention USB-C and wireless charging.I must have missed it in the description but they have built in "Tile" so you can find them if they are lost
4,Sounds quality is really nice but it likes to cut out sometimes. Battery's decent. I definitely can use them to cancel out most noise.
5,These are really great headphones I wear them to work around a CNC machine so they canceled the noise just enough for me to be able to have a clear head but here the machine go off when I need it to
5,The sound quality is very clear it doesn't feel as if it is loud but when you have in one headphone you can tell how loud it gets. Battery haven't died on me ever yet. Comfort is ok the earphones are supposed to be put in and twisted so that the stem is pointing downwards. Wings were a bit big so I had to use the smaller ones. I dont have any pairing issues. Pairs fast automatically and with either or both earphones at the same time. Very good quality earphones.
5,The product has a good sound quality and it  picks up the wireless signal very fast.
5,It comes with spacers to fit almost all sized ears. The noise cancellation is pretty good. Decent form factor. Wireless charging. Batteries last decent amount of time.Very few complaints! Buy them on sale.
3,Works great 99% of the time.  Sometimes it’s weird to recalibrate if I take it out of my ear and hold in my hand since the touch feature is sensitive.  Then once back in my ear seems non responsive until disconnected and reconnected even to the power on/off efforts.  But then once settled in again sound quality is great personal sound is great.  Also the right side can have difficulty charging if the rubber boot is on.
3,They fit well and have decent sound quality. I dont have many demands from my ear buds so these work great for the price. However the bluetooth connection is not very stable. Not sure if its just my item or the tech on these in general. But the bluetooth will "skip" occasionally. Not the biggest problem for me.
4,First set worked for a couple of weeks then the right earpiece shorted out Sent back to Amazon thru Kohl’s and other arrived soon afterward no problems with second set so far Noise cancelling is awesome and the App is great you can customize your earphones and the sound is good
4,Skullcandy did a great job with the ANC true wireless earphones. They sound great loud and has good noise cancelation. They will also stay in place due to the eartips that come with the product. I give 4 stars just due to my ear hurting a little after using these for long sessions but very good product overall.
3,These were okay for the three weeks that they worked. I had a pair of wired Skullcandy earbuds that I found more comfortable than Apple’s. So I thought I’d buy the wireless pair to use with my jack-free IPhone. After three weeks of light usage the right earbud stopped turning on when I removed it from the charging case. I tried resetting it but it just didn’t do anything. No red light to say it was on no blue light to say it was pairing. Dead. So I returned it for a refund. I know that statistically there’s going to be some defective products but I’ll take my chances with a different brand now.
1,This product. Man. The first one I ordered I had sent back I thought it would just be a fluke. It skipped on the audio track like I was walking around with a Walkman CD player 20 years ago. Second pair arrives and it STILL does the same thing. For $60 bucks that is ridiculous my $20 pair of wireless earphones is holding up better. Now two months later the battery life is only two hours before it just shuts off. Also no low battery warning it’ll just shut off on you. The audio still skips if I’m moving around too much or have my phone in my pocket. Now the latest issue is that each airbud refuses to pair with each other. They will only pair left or right by themselves making it unable to play in both ears. Never again I’ll stick with my $20 pair which are still going three months strong skull candy wireless is awful.
4,Was very surprised at the noise canceling in wireless earbuds. The application is fantastic and tailors to your own hearing. After going through the setup it almost matches my last hearing teat..haha. They sound great set well in my ears and the ability to out them in the holder and charge is fantastic.
3,They just don't fit right. Probably the most uncomfortable ear buds I've owned. Sound quality is good. Noise canceling is sub par. Wouldn't recommend.
1,I’m an iPhone user so keep in mind I’ve been spoiled by a set of GEN 1 AirPods lol. These things are utterly trash they never pair together after numerous resets of the Bluetooth and the firmware on the earbuds. One will pair and you can get sound of that which is nice but when you would like both your buds in playing simultaneously your shit outta luck. The angle they go into your ear canal is screwed up so they have to be poking out 90° from your ear for you to get good sound none of the air Bud attachment fit any better than the ones that came installed. I should’ve return these things but I figured after I downloaded the app maybe some of this would be resolved but sadly the absolute an absolute joke so don’t even bother if you have the misfortune of purchasing these damn things think I’m just gonna go ahead and spend the money and buy another set of AirPods
1,This stuff is not rocket science.  The first pair I bought I opened everything up let the buds charge in the case with the case plugged in for 8 hours then tried to pair them with my phone.  Right off the bat the "auto-on" function did not work none of the red LED lights or blue pairing lights came on the touch pads did not work obviously the things didn't work - although the case itself WAS fully charged.  Called customer service the lady was very friendly but I ended up just exchanging them for another pair on amazon which they sent to me within a few days.  Did the same process over again.  This time they appeared to function properly with the auto-on and pairing mode and yada yada however...each ear bud was considered as its own device and they could not pair together!!! I uploaded pictures to show what I mean.  Yes I am able to have 2 devices connected to bluetooth at the same time on my iphone but it only plays from one ear bud when i connect BOTH of them to bluetooth -  What a joke.  Skullcandy should really step their game up a little bit with these.  Needless to say I will be returning these will not be buying another pair and am rather disappointed.
2,In order to charge my skullcandy earbuds I have to take everything off of them. It's like they don't fit in the charging case with the rubber attachments. It's really frustrating to charge them at night and not being able to use them because any movement to the case causes them to to unlatch from ports. Other than that with a full charge they have good sound and are comfortable to use all day
5,These are an excellent pair of earbuds so far. Sound quality/battery life is amazing though I must say there are times where the earbuds don't sync and only one of them works but besides that these are a great set of earbuds.
5,I love the way it fits in my ear hoe and I can adjust my earpiece and it does not mess with the volume or anything
2,Bought my first set at Costco without noise canceling had to return them because the right one had a crackle noise to it and every other phone call people were complaining I was cutting out. I enjoyed them and was hoping it was just a issue with this pair so I purchased these here with noise canceling. Exact same issues beard talked to the manufacture And they had me do a hard reset wouldn’t fix the problem sound quality when it’s not crackling is very decent and loud enough. What is very impressive as the noise canceling I wore them in my truck which is very loud and it sounds like you’re riding in the quietest Cadillac on the road. Looks like they have good ratings from everybody else I just don’t know how I got too bad pair in a row maybe it’s the shape of my ear her face. Also the buttons are very temperamental as they don’t have a positive click or anything they are just touch well there’s a difference between tapping on them and touching them to do different commands makes them very finicky.
5,Sound quality is good. Fit is good. Battery is great. Nothing super special or over the top but they just work so well it's boringly reliable.
3,The sound was okay but idk about the quality. My left ear bud stopped charging if the case was closed after two weeks and finally after a couple months the sound just stopped working all together. I can still use the touch function I just don't get sound
5,Great noise canceling lightweight and good use times.
5,These are great. I got them for work and to use on discord as my normal anc headset gives me headaches. It takes some getting used to the touch controls as I keep ending calls. But the mic works decent just sounds a little tinny. The anc isn't great I can still hear things around me but it's not too bad and cuts out a lot of stuff. The sound is great and there's some different silicone ear pieces to try to get a good fit.
5,These ear buds were super easy to connect and use.  Comfortable to wear and for the price the noise cancelling is outstanding.  Don't think twice buy them.
2,As far as the app goes its only real function that ive noticed is to switch to turn off and on the ambient mode which is awful and just sounds like static. Otherwise the app only works the first time you connect with it. Every time i set up the app it would desync from my pods the very next time I went to use them. Speaking of which everytime i do try to use them now they get stuck in solo mode and the only way Ive found to fix this through other online forums not skullcandys help was to factory reset them each time. And for some reason now i cant even factory reset them reliably because the pods dont register your touches very well at all.
3,Jamming out chilling then hit with random static either one side the other or both. Comes randomly and goes randomly. Other than that sometimes one side turns off randomly. Shouldn't be that way for something that cost 150. Pretty decent like the tile and wireless charging features are why i bought them
2,So I got the first one worked for a week. Then right ear bud wouldn't charge. No red light. Couldn't do anything with it. Got replacement lasted for 2 months then started doing the same thing. Right ear bud. No red light no charge. On my third pair just frustrating since I like the sound and quality but too much to have to keep getting a new pair. BTW third pair is from manufacture warranty. We will see.
5,I have purchased all major brand buds. These are the absolute best all around.
5,Totally worth buying them. The noise cancelling feature works great you can really tell the difference with it on and off. I was a little worried because I know Skullcandy headphones tend to pop and crack a lot but I haven’t had that issue. The charge time is fast which is great on the run. The app is a pretty cool feature to have too. If you are in busy places often or want to not be able to hear much but your music these are for you.
5,I really like these. My hearing is not that great so being able to hear conversations are a blessing. The only down side is I wish when you tap to do a voice dial it would be two instead of three. If I tap twice it starts playing my music and I have to stop it to make a call.
2,Left earbud stop charging contacted the company but they did not solve the problem; The worst customer support I’ve ever experienced. Never again I’m switching brands. It seems that a lot of people are having this problem with the left earbud not charging and the company is not taking any responsibility.
2,I’m giving these a 2 star because about 3 months in the right bud kept going in and out. Just 6months later the right bud still going in and out then crackling and now does not work at all. We have a few of the other cheaper versions of skull candy ear buds and loved them. I decided to pay for the more expensive pair this time and not happy with them at all.
5,Connect easily and receives signal from a good distance too!
5,The earbuds sometimes get loose while talking or if you laugh. So having to constantly keep reasserting them could be become monotonous.
3,These earbuds are an alternative to the Apple air pod pros for literally half the price. The noise cancelling isn’t as effective as I would like but it works. Easy set up on my iPhone the personalization of sound is a nice feature. The controls on the headphones can be frustrating at times however I attribute this to not enough experience. All in all I’d give these headphones 3.5 stars.
5,Very nice and consistent headphones. Great quality and sound
1,These won’t last toy longer than a couple months. I work in an office job and basically just listen to music at work for background noise. More often than not I have my music on the lowest volume setting it can go and they still blew after just a couple months. In my opinion these are way too expensive to only last a couple months so don’t even waste your money buying these.
2,The major problems I had was that the audio started cutting out not even 5-10 feet away from my phone and the touch controls were wildly inconsistent. I tried to activate ambient noise by tapping twice and holding once after and it pauses or skips the track or switches the EC mode. I try to pause the track with two taps and the volume gets lowered instead. I called Skullcandy customer support and they said that my product was defective and should be returned but reading through reviews on Amazon Best Buy and tech review sites seem to support the prevalence of finicky controls. Nevertheless I’m opting to return these earbuds to Amazon; I’m utterly confused as to how Skullcandy can make such solid wired earbuds but these wireless earbuds are so inconsistent. Hopefully I’ll update my review with better results.Battery life and comfort is decent though in my experience.
4,Yes
1,I’ve always used skullcandy headphones. I had the older indie model and they lasted for years. I bought these and not even 3 months of having them and the left earbud just cuts in and out. Don’t buy these save your money and get a better quality product. It’s worth it in the long run.
4,It was amazing up until a month or so in. It lost its touch. 😬 I still use them though but it does seem to wear down.
3,They would have gotten a better review but my husband has a hard time getting the to charge in the case and its irritating
2,I like Skullcandy I was one first people to start wearing them back in early 2000s but from what I'm seeing what these headphones they're not living up to Skullcandy quality. The song is not loud enough and don't have quality sounded. The noise cancellation doesn't really work and it's hard to keep the earbuds in your ear which I feel they should come with a better way of keeping them in your ears. if I am talking or eating they will fall out my ear and the rubber cover don't make it no better. I spent over $70 to get these ear buds  just to have poor quality and for them to not stay in my ear and to have low sound in one of them and it also hard people to hear on them and the other way around. skullcandy really let me down....smh
2,I love Skullcandy as a company ive bought many products for myself and children. The issue im having is that the leads on the charging portion of the earbuds are not making solid contact. No matter how much repositioning i do i seem to have no luck. Most companies that work through amazon make exchanges very easy and simple. Skullcandy has not yet received this memo of ease of returns. I have to go to their site submit a claim mail back the product and wait for them to process the claim and then ship them back. which sounds just fine if you are good without your product for 2-3 weeks. I exercise 5-6 days a week and my earbuds are the lifeblood for my workouts. It would be as if you had a defective iPhone and were told you will be going 2-3 weeks without a phone for them to sort out the damaged goods.
4,The paring is really the only drawback with this product. It can take 2 to 4 times to get it sync up with my device and to each other without issues.
1,The headphones lasted exactly 4 months with only occasional use (once or twice a week for an a max of two hours at a time). Definitely not worth the price for only 4 months and the return window is 5 weeks so... if you are looking for wireless headphones look elsewhere.For context I am an electrical engineer so I have laid out the issue in the next paragraph. I would fix it myself and have in the past for cheap headphones but that would break the waterproofing seal.The right earbud will not emit any sound at all but will still pair with my phone and with the other headphone so its not a pairing issue. If I shake it a little bit some bots and pieces of sound come out so it is most likely a mechanical failure of the connection to the speaker. This shows that it is a shoddy product with terrible solder points.
1,I was so excited to get these earbuds.  And for the first few hours everything was awesome.  The sound was great and I loved how well they fit.But after a couple of days I got the warning that the battery was low on the right earbud.  So I put it back in the case and saw that the red light wasn't coming on.  I tried to shift it around and couldn't get it to sit down on the chargers.  It died within 2 days so I returned it and just had Amazon send me a 2nd set.The new set worked great for a few months.  Again I loved the sound the fit and the noise cancelling worked really well.  But a couple weeks ago the right earbud gave me the warning that the battery was low.  This was after it sitting in the case overnight.  Exact same problem.  The earbud is no longer charging and is now effectively dead.I don't know if I just had 2 duds but I'm guessing that more people have had this problem and likely if you haven't it is coming.  Good luck.  I'll be buying something else now . . .
2,So right away when I got them I tried to charge them on a wireless charger and the would not charge but I still had the USB charger I also tried to connect them to the Skullcandy App and it registered them but never said they were connected so regardless of that I used them for about 1 month and the Left earbud stopped working all together
4,Not as loud as I would like and can get crackly when at full volume during some songs. Other than that they’re great.
5,I can definitely say these things kick ass at noise canceling. I have 5 kids and I’d never know it with these babies on and some good music even at half volume. They are a bit dangerous tho for that same reason. You might be reading a good book and 3 hours later remember you have kids and find the house absolutely demolished. But hey at least you’d have been able to relax haha.
3,I purchased these specifically for noise cancelling in loud musical environment. They do provide some protection but not good enough for my sensitive ears. I don't know whether I'll keep them for the bluetooth feature. Not very important to me.
5,Excelente compra! Fue para regalar y le encantó. La batería es duradera y el sonido genial.
1,It's because they're garbage.Seriously.  They're trash.I will say that the sound quality is great when they work. Noise cancellation is top notch and while a bit uncomfortable at times they rarely slip out. These are absolutely perfect for the gym... when they actually work.Here's the main problem. After about a month or two of use one of the buds (or both if you're super unlucky) will stop charging.  These are basically useless if you can't charge them. I thought maybe I ended up with duds but three pairs later? Nope. These are just poorly made. To their credit Skullcandy will replace them without fuss when they break on you but even those start having issues within a few weeks. The left bud of my most recent replacement is now failing to charge too and I'm just done. Sure I could continue sending them back until the warranty runs out but honestly? It's just cheaper to go with another brand since shipping is completely at your expense. Oh and keep in mind they recently reduced their warranty. Skullcandy will only replace them for up to a year now.Final verdict? Pass on these. Spend the money you'll waste relatedly shipping these in for replacement on better quality earbuds instead.
1,I've had these since January 2021 and at first they were okay. I just needed a pair of wireless earbuds for my job. They sound pretty good the airpod knockoff design isn't my cup of tea but it wasn't a deal breaker. After a few weeks or maybe a month they started cutting in and out when I have podcasts playing and it's super annoying. Resetting them kinda helped but the problem always resurfaced. After that they started to just straight up disconnect from my phone entirely (for virtually no reason) while I was listening to my podcast and it's really annoying. And more recently the right earbud won't properly sit in the case unless I push it down. Which means it won't charge unless I fiddle with it for 5 minutes which I'd really rather not do and would rather just have them work and be a decent pair of earbuds. I switched to these from the raycon E100s and I'm honestly considering picking them up again but they're not even worth it because they have their own set of problems too. They worked good for a little bit but don't expect them to work properly after a few months of use. I'm just gonna go with Sony or an actual brand that can make decent products.
2,Decent knock around head phones. This is my second pair. Half decent sound quality for a decent price. HOWEVER… the Bluetooth is terrible! When I am at my crowded gym the headphones skip. It drives me nuts. It’s not the Wi-Fi or my phone it’s 100% the headphones.
3,I really liked the earbuds but one of them just stopped charging no matter what i tried it just never charged i still use the one that works just because theyre good earbuds but its still anmoying nonetheless
2,I bought these over summer to try out.  they worked great.  2-3 months later they just stopped charging.  I tried all the steps to get them going again and no dice. Submitted them for a warranty replacement.  Skullcandy sent me a new pair and the new pair after 3 months have stopped working properly.  the left bud works normally the right bud doesn't charge anymore.  I don't think I'll be buying anymore skullcandy earbuds.  headsets maybe.
5,I use this product while working. I have no complaints. They are comfortable and don't fall out. I highly reccomend.
4,Not the greatest noise cancelation but beats any other buds I own. Love the bass output. Never had them die on me and listen all through school and workouts.
5,Great product - cancels a great deal of ambient noise. Looses a bit at higher frequencies but most of our noise is in the lower bands.
1,where to start?... case charging the ear buds dont make good contact in the case and you will pull out half charged or dead buds. next the noise canceling for an engine noise it does ok at blocking the exhaust noise but can still hear the engine noise while weedwacking you can hear every hit of grass pop pop pop not so good. the bluetooth is old protocol and only goes roughly 30 ft instead of the new standard that goes 100 ft. they have a random problem connecting to each other. the loop thing to make it more snug in your ear comes off every time you take the buds out. basically these are trash and should be avoided. 10/10 would not recommend.
5,Not as good as skull candy usually is for sure
4,Everything is perfect besides the music getting cut off there and there but it rarely happens beside that it's great!
5,I actually got these when they were 50% off so for the price they were well worth it for a teenage boy.
3,I liked the fact that this was made in Vietnam and American company.I dislike it stopped working.Phone call quality not good.
5,Use them every day and love them. I’m a nurse working in a busy environment at desk the staff are working with patients right outside my office with door open all day and with headphones in I am able to do my job in a timely fashion. I also have migraines and these help block sounds that normally would make things worse.  Best investment highly recommend
5,They do all the things I was looking for in wireless earbuds they even fit in small ears and the clip holds them in place during work.
3,I was very pleased
5,Suena muy bienSe escucha un sonido muy claro en agudos y bajos muy fuertesPerfectos para hacer deporte
5,Good shape good clear soundsthe bass is beautiful
5,I love the product. Lost the one I just purchased at the V.A. Hospital. Some bet llis gonna bee static till he finds you gotta charge from time to time. HAPPY HOLIDAYS.  Enjoy
3,I loved these when I first got them. They worked beautifully to start with. After a week or two the left ear bud began disconnecting randomly. Eventually it disconnected and would not reconnect or charge in the case. Unfortunately with ANC ear buds losing one means they're both useless so I'm now hoping Skull Candy or Amazon comes through with good support. Will update after reaching out.
5,I originally got these as a solution to my phone's earphone jack no longer working. Now I can't really see myself going back to wired headphones.
1,Please don't waste your money on this.  After two months of use the left earphone stopped turning on.  No matter what you do it doesn't turn on.  there are cheaper options on the market that do not have these problems.  the worst thing is that when I live outside the United States I cannot apply for the reimbursement.  Just a disappointment.EDIT: 2FebI do not know what happened.  I Didn't throw them away because my little daughter liked the light that still turned on on the right earbud.  From time to time I would find them in her toy box and checked that the left one still hadn't turned on.  Today a month later I find them all beaten up again and both work fine.... I'll change the rating to 2 stars.  If they work in a month I will give them 3 stars.Edit 3: 11 of marchStill working.Edit: 2 MayRight one died. It connect to the cellphone but make no sound. Back to 1 star.
1,The fit is great. The sound quality is great. The battery life is good but not as good as advertised. The most aggravating issue is the connectivity and occasional static issues. They will advise you to reset or re-pair them and I've had the same issues over and over. Disappointing because I've really enjoyed using some of their other products which are typically a good value.They advertise this as an alternative to Airpod Pros and it just really doesn't hold up for me.Update: Increased amount of connectivity issues. How many times am I supposed to reset these things?!? Daily?!? My cheapo $30 Wal-Mart specials connect more reliably. One ear bud or the other will have static and/or drop of entirely. ANC seems to make sound issues worse. Frustrating.Update 2: Returned product to Skullcandy and they immediately (not sure how they got it to me so quickly - amazing) sent me a replacement. Having much improved experience with this pair. Maybe the first was a lemon(?). Thanks for the good service Skullcandy. My faith is restored.Update 3. Now the right one won't power on or take a charge. What a joke. I can not recommend this product at all.
2,So I got the ANC because I had used the Indy before. Its okay for music but the controls are horrible. Its so hard to switch from ambient mood to noise cancelling or from movie mood to music mood. This was the least of my problems as I usually just went to the app. I also discovered that anytime I used it for calls the other person always complained they couldn't hear me properly.For those of us with small ears the pods keep slipping out. Even when i changed the silicon to the smallest one. The wings don't help either. The slip off too.Though a good product generally Its not suitable for me and I think the Indy is way better. Even a friend said the same.
2,Ok so i purchased these in February  and wanted to wait before I spoke to soon so first the pros. Sound quality is good easy to use controls. Now the cons which is a deal breaker for me. So if you are gonna use these for more then one device there a huge fail unless mine are defective or I’m missing something Or over looked but I can’t pair them with more then one device so if I’m using my iPad and then leave the house to run errands or whatever and want to use the ear buds with my phone  I can’t because I forget to unpair them from my iPad I think for the price you should be able to pair them with more then one device but that’s just my opinion. I would not purchase again for that simple fact
5,My experience has been great with these. The Skullcandy app developed a tune specific to my ears and the noise cancellation with movie mode made it that much better. If you have the extra money shoot for this version as it is WELL equipped. My favorite option would be the partnership with Tile to keep track of it it has already saved me from buying a replacement.
3,The audio quality on these are outstanding!  The part that I'm not as enthused about is the actual fit within my ear  -the rubber wedges that are supposed to lodge the earbuds in your ear tend to move and so I find myself fidgeting with the earbud trying to keep it in my ear.  Not a huge problem just annoying - especially when I'm running.  Otherwise solid earbuds
5,Fits great in the ear they are loud you can talk on them and here very well
4,It doesn't connect to my pc as I'd hoped for. I've gone through all the trouble shooting so I gave up hope but they're fine earbuds
5,I initially bought headphones from another company on here that always has sales & was so disappointed. I took a chance on these and I love them. They’re are very comfortable and fit in your ears really well. They also have tile so you can find them which is really great. I’m so impressed by these!
5,These are honestly the best earbuds that I have ever had. They sound amazing and work great. I use them for work and have no problem with the Bluetooth connection distance or losing connection. The connect easily and seem to last for a long time. And the charge rather quickly. Over all these are great especially for the price
1,I used these 2 times. Every few minutes the sound crackles out. Like static or something. On the 3rd time I used them they forgot that they existed. They would not pair with my phone or with each other. I followed the directions on Skull Candy support page. Step one hold for 6 seconds to power off. This did not work. Instead they did nothing. Holding for longer than 6 seconds put them in "Pairing" mode? But they wouldn't pair. I tried putting them in the case to power off. They would auto power off but still would not pair with each other. I just want some comfortable decent sounding ear buds for the gym. I don't need phone calls voice assistants or stuff. Just want to jam some tunes. Pretty disappointed in this product. We will see if I can get any help from the company.
5,These are just as good if not better than the apple ear buds!!
2,The only complaint I have is that they cut out often they randomly disconnect from bluetooth and they sometimes throw enough static that I have to restart them for them to work. It doesn't always do this but it's pretty darn important for headphones to not throw static and loose the ability to make sound. I won't buy replacements.
5,The noise cancellation is amazing! I’m in love with it. Even with it off the sound quality is solid and strong. I can easily see my house being destroyed by kids if I’m not careful to turn it off when they’re up. Super happy I decided to get these they’re a game changer. Skullcandy has always had great sound quality but the noise cancellation makes it so much better.
2,So background info I'm a union electrician and I work mostly new construction.I ordered these to have something in my ear while I'm at work and at first they started off great I loved the sound.Midway through my first shift and the sound quality disappeared 😞 they went from a solid 4 out of 5 to a measly 2 out of 5.I honestly don't know what happenedone second they were damn near perfect and the next they were pretty much useless.I've reset the earbuds multiple times in the past 72 hours with no noticeable effect.It started with the volume what should be full blast sounds like its been cut in half the ANC had a strong hissing sound and the ambient mode is terrible. It almost sounds like the mic is constantly on.
4,Have a lot of options which is great. But battery life isn't great and charging is annoying.
5,Overall the quality and fitting is great! When I use the ear buds solely as music they are awesome. But I bought them with an idea of multipurpose so I could take phone calls. But there is no noise cancellation for the person you’re calling. They hear EVERYTHING around you. Even when I make adjustments in the app it didn’t help.
1,Great headphones but they stopped working after the return window so im having to deal with skullcandys warnty process and its a huge headache it's been 3 months and I still don't have them back
5,Its what I had expected from this product although the secure fit into the ears wasn't good enough because it tends to drop after an hour or two while working in an office environment.  It needs a better " fin " around the ear piece like the Bose earphones has .  Other than that this is perfect in ear headphones with ANC for me.
3,Initial BT pairing worked well. Unable to connect to another device without resetting the earbuds using a frustrating reset procedure. The fit is not very good for me and they come loose from my ear very often.  Good battery life and sound. Best for listening to music or podcasts; not good for calls as the other party always complains that the mic isn't loud enough.
5,Amazing. The sound quality is great be it a phone call or music or what ever I'm listening to. My one and only issue is I have used skull candies for a decade but for some reason the silicon for these buds make my ears itch after only a short period of use.Otherwise perfect gift to myself.
1,I have ordered three sets of these because the sound is awesome. The first set lasted about a 1.5 years. The second set 2 months (I thought maybe bad luck) and third set 1 month. Read previous reviews about left bud going out. DO NOT BUY! It's really unfortunate because they were awesome. Skullcandy quality has really gone down.
3,I looooove these ear buds but after only having them for 4 months the left one won't hold a charge anymore. They are still under warranty but I hate the fact that I have to pay for shipping to get them replaced. I feel like they should have better service than that. These are not cheap ear buds.
3,I am overall disappointed with this product. The battery life is very short the sound is at times good then not. Sometimes I there is sound in both ears sometimes not. Sometimes they turn off automatically then turn back on for no apparent reason. I bought them to conduct professional appointment... Quite disappointed. I would not recommend this product.
5,the sound quality is so good. the noise cancelation is good except it does not fully block out sound although every one does not fully block the sound out. battery is amazing ambient noise is weird to listen to but I will be honest it really helps so my mom can't sneak up on me. it does wirelessly charge but you have to have a flat wireless charging pad.
2,Device lacks safety strap. Had it for a week lost the right ear bud. Not worth a dime won't buy one again because they are too easy to lose.They work ok and are loud enough. They seem to work long enough and the app is ok. But no safety strap  and the ease of losing it too much money to keep up with
5,La bateria dura muchisimo y la cancelacion de ruido hace q sin ninguna musica ni sonido casi no escuches hacia afueraEl sonido es exlente con mucho bajo etc. Tiene una aplicacion en donde puedes crear un perfil de audio de acuerdo con tus necesidades.Me encanto
5,Wish noise cancelling worked a little bit better.
4,The confort can be better. They can be a little small with out the half ring.
3,Others can’t hear me well on a call. But I do like the noise canceling and listening to music/tv
5,Like it very much
2,Headphones have decent sound quality and battery lasts long as advertised. My pair have a major issue with maintaining constant connection and like to cut out at random. My devices are iPhone 12 and iPad Pro 12.9 so it not old Bluetooth.
3,First I got to say the sound quality is amazing but my right earbud has stopped charging and it's only been a little over a month of use
4,Noise cancellation was okay and battery life is great. I only wish these had been a bit louder.
5,These are great earbuds and totally worth it. The sound quality is amazing. When the noise cancelling is turned on the whole world drowns out. The ambient mode is also great for office work or a busy household. Highly recommend these to anyone interested in noise cancellation. I prefer these over the Raycon the work headphones.
3,Sound quality is pretty good noise canceling is ok the rubber pieces dont stay in place very well tho which is my biggest issue.
5,None
2,I purchased these after a misplaced a pair of Air pods Pro ear buds. I figured I’d give this a try since I kinda thought the air pods were over priced. These were awful don’t connect immediately the case feels cheap the ear bud feels cheap and bigger than air pods. The sound quality seemed ok out of these but not better than the other. My biggest issue was these just didn’t connect seamlessly and the app never ended up working. I returned them and gladly paid the extra for the air pods pro. I do see the price has dropped on these again so they are getting close to the correct price to value. I’d say they should be under $100 for the quality that they are.
3,Like the sound quality but has static sound once in awhile. Also the battery life is not good. only lasts for around 1.5-2hrs
5,I've had these for a little over a month now and i use them almost every day during work they are excellent and would i definitely recommend . the noise cancelling is pretty good(note: the louder your music is the less you here any way.) but the battery life is excellent.
5,I enjoy them. I just have a problem with them staying in my ears. They fall out real easy.
2,These sounded pretty good actually but the software for them was pretty glitchy and didn’t work that great. I paused my music for about 2 minutes without removing them from my ears and they had to be reconnected. They also aren’t made with very good quality plastic including the charging case. Overall seems a bit overpriced and they don’t deliver on a lot of things. Wouldn’t recommend but not the worst headphones I’ve ever used.
2,Here I am. 3 months from the date I purchased them $80 poorer both earbuds stopped working. (And not just the buzzing noise you get when ANC is trying to get itself to work. Like totally dont work or emit any sound while still connecting to my phone...) I'm sending them to Skullcandy for a warranty on my own dime. Kinda wish I would have gotten a different set of earbuds.When they work they are awesome!...but they dont and it seems this is the norm around town.
5,Would definitely buy again... they fit in my ears perfectly and the sound is just again fantastic....
5,These are a fantastic pair of earbuds. I spent little more than I usually would have. But the money was well worth the it! I’ve used these in the gym and outdoor walks and mowing the lawn. They are comfortable and the noise canceling is real good.Highly recommend these!
3,The Skull Candy buds deliver superior sound especially low frequencies and the rubber fit is snug and stable at the gym while moving around unlike some other alternatives.Supports a surprisingly rich set of touch and tap haptics and wireless charging at a tiny fraction of what some others pay...UPDATE: STOPPED WORKING.  Unable to pair. Returned.
5,Awesome sound quality.
2,I sent them back the noise cancelation didnt work at all. So on the airplane I bought them to use on had to use at full volume and could still barely hear the movie over the various noises in the plane.
3,The right earbud at higher volume sounds like it’s blow ive used them a total of maybe 10 hours so farNot impressd at all probably goingTo get the new air pods as a long time skull candy user I was very disappointed in the quality overall.
5,I love these earbuds! They did take a minute for me to get use to the buds just sitting in my ears but once I figured they wouldn’t fall out it’s been an amazing experience! Highly recommend! Easy to use for those of us who may be a bit technologically challenged...
5,Best I've tried so far. I've had a few of the cheaper brand and the Samsung buds. These sound better. They stay in my ears despite the larger size. The controls take some getting used to but everything can be done via one touch button on each bud.
1,The first time I thought it was a fluke and got an exchange. Now I’m out of the country and again the CASE stopped working. Once I got it balanced EXACTLY right one earbud still won’t connect. Sad sad sad waste of money.
4,What can I say.Gift for girlfriend and she loves them so I love them.
5,The sound quality is great. I am a big Beatles fan and to me their music sounds like you are their in the studio with them. Again I can only speak for myself but I find these earbuds just amazing sound quality. Everything is crystal clear when I have the pair on.
5,Se ajustan muy bien y sé escuchan de maravilla..
5,These ear buds have everything I wanted when looking to make my purchase. They sound better and we're almost $100 cheaper than my last pair
3,I like these headphones cause the quality was good but after only a month of using them outdoors some wires came loose inside and the left one no longer works unless you shake it around not good for the cost of the headphones
2,Funcionaron bien pero el audífono derecho ya no carga tiene un falso contacto y se activa dentro del case una decepción porque estaba muy contento con ellos
4,rubber a little tough on ears over long periods but they work and look amazing
1,The headphones didn’t charge in the battery pack and even when charged in my old battery pack they wouldn’t turn on. So I’m guessing they don’t connect to the battery pack at all in order to work properly. Yes I do know how to connect them as should be obvious by my previous comments I have had them before. Really disappointed. Wish I had known how to return the product for a refund or even had the time to do so.
1,They sounded good and battery life was pretty good but after only 4 months the left earbud is dead back to Sony
3,I know it says they are compatible with iPhone but they aren't. We've followed the instructions spoke with customer service. Not much else we can do but let other iPhone users know they're traveling down the wrong path.  but I'm sure they're great with android.
5,One earbud just stopped working. Junk! The company made it right and replaced them!
2,Love them but a major problem & it happened to hubby & I they stop charging & won't work no one! Happens within 6 months of owning them! Very sad i liked them but won't recommend them
5,So far so good. They work so I have no complaints. I don’t have much to compare them to but they seem worth the price to me and I’ll return something in a min if it’s not worth the cost. Seems like a quality product tho. Two thumbs up!
5,Very nice. Sounds good noise cancellation works and fits securely in my ears.
5,These earbuds were everything I was hoping for and at a great price. Perfect fit and comfort for those long calls. Intuitive controls and excellent sound. The noise canceling is pretty good and being able to also go to ambient mode or off is an added bonus.
3,These are ok have problems with connecting blips.
5,So I'm a huge noise canceling person and have bought to many that haven't worked but I guess you really need to look at the price as well. The price design and complete package of these Skullcandy are worth ever bit of the product and there quality is amazing. Thanks Skullcandy for not disappointing me.
1,They’ll stop connecting to each other / your device within a year. No troubleshooting works. Don’t waste your time or money 🙄
1,The earpieces suddenly make a terrible metallic noise.  You have to pause the music and resume to start hearing music. It is like a circular saw.Battery life is not great.Fitting not great.Noise cancellation is extremely marginal.I personally have purchased 20$ noise cancellation earphones with better performance
5,Got these as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves them uses them all the time. 100 percent recommend
4,Sounded great didn't connect to.2 devices so I returned them
4,The noise cancelling is definitely lacking in some areas
5,Absolutely phenomenal sound!! Noise canceling is a game changer! Call quality is crystal clear and mic pick up is pristine. Music plays beautifully through these ear buds. Great highs solid mids and killer lows!!! Serious quality for the price. My choice for "best bang for the buck".
1,I bought these assuming they were repaired headphones and they would feel "like new" and iI wouldn't notice I bought them repaired but it feels like they haven't been repaired at all. The audio isn't as clear in the right ear pod as the left even with the personal sound it feels like something is missing They disconnect constantly the audio has recently just distorting entirely at random and lastly both sides sometime don't play audio even thought they're connected I have to shut the one off and turn it back on again. it's ridiculous.
3,I’m using these to listen to music and answer calls while I’m at work at the paper mill and the noise canceling feature can’t cancel out the motors and they start making a scratchy sound.
4,Great all around sound
5,Got these for my husband as an early Father’s Day gift—he loves them! Sound quality is excellent volume control is great and they fit comfortably. He hasn’t toyed with any other features but so far they are worth every penny!
1,Decent sound quality and battery life but they are slow to connect awful noise canceling and zero pass-through. Right ear bud going out after less than 6 months.
2,I returned Skullcandy Indy ANC True Wireless Noise Cancelling In-Ear Earbuds because one earbud would just stop working for no reason. It wasn't consistently the same earbud either. Each one would randomly cut off at various times. Yes they were fully charged and yes they were correctly connected with bluetooth. I am sick about this because I could've purchased Apple EarPods for about the same price on Target dot com the other day.
4,They work fine and the charger is handy
2,No longer compatible with iPhone so iPhone users don’t even waste your time or money.
4,Great sound and perfect fit to my ears
1,It was great connected perfectly and the anc wasn’t as good as AirPods but they still worked. The left one for me broke a couple days after the return period ended I wouldn’t buy these you’re better off getting AirPods or a pair of beats fit pro
1,More power to you if you want to take a gamble on these but don’t expect greatness. If you like things that fire right up and pair with your device straight out of the box with no hassle then get AirPods.. otherwise you’ll waste around 3 hours trying to figure these out or get them to reliably connect/stay connected and then still get AirPods. Cheap Chinese junk..
1,Dropped the case and the left earbud won’t charge anymore also they would randomly turn on and off in your ears and disconnect and reconnect as well terrible product other reviews had me a little skeptical but I still bought don’t make the same mistake I did
2,I read the reviews so I knew the chance I was taking. My 12 year old loved these earbuds until one went out.
3,Battery life is terrible doesn't even do 6hr without ANC on. It does have better sound than most Skullcandy. But I was very disappointed in the battery life.
1,Headaches.When they work they work. But for the hassle not worth a penny.  Second pair  the right earbud stopped charging or working.Second pair.  Couldn't even pair with my phone. Followed all instructions and youtube videosPlease stay away from this brand.
3,The charge method needs to be changed or something one earbud stopped charging only sometimes
5,These headphones are amazing if you aren’t an Apple snob. I had a pair of AirPods and I lost one of them riding my motorcycle. These (Skullcandy Indy ANC) headphones are secure noise cancelling and definitely way better than the price says.
2,The Skullcandy earphones do not work well with my IPhone.  I am used to having the calls announced when the phone rings and also used to being able to have Siri make calls for me while driving.  That does not happen with the Skullcandy.  I don't like them.  The battery life is good I can say that much.
2,the left earbud will not charge or turn on. it isn't responsive at all. I regret not getting the warranty. will look for earbuds elsewhere. this is not the first time I've heard of this brand breaking.
5,Buenisimos me gustan
5,Worth every cent paid
1,If the noise cancellation is one of the most important aspect of your decision to choose this item I just tell you the ANC is not useful AT ALL in this model I trusted the brand because I have two wireless headphones from Skullcandy and I like them so much but these earbuds are just useless for their Noise cancellation feature why? When you activate them you don't really notice the difference if you compare it with other brands the ANC in this model is very very weak!Sound quality is normal and above!The grip in your ear is fantastic they stay there and don't seem to be lousy!I have not really checked the battery life and the water resistance specs as my main focus was the ANC and once I got disappointed from that I returned the product. So no comment on those features. However if you are on a low budget and thinking of a earbud that can play your song and do some casual things then it is a good choice.
1,I ordered these. They worked great I loved them. Within 3 months the battery case stopped charging. I used their warranty services. They had me ship it to San Diego at my own expense. After 2 weeks they came back and everything worked well. Then the right ear bud stopped charging. Again I have to ship it back to San Diego at my cost. So I'm at 1/3 of the price I paid for these originally because within 6 months they've been defective not once but twice. I could have gotten a cheaper pair while functional would have had less features. I probably should have done that. I won't be buying skullcandy earphones anymore.
1,Our son used his earbuds for about 3 weeks the right one stopped working and it will not pair to any device. We are past our return date
2,I love Skullcandy and have purchased several pairs of wired earbuds of theirs over the years from the basic to the deluxe. There has always been consistent quality so I decided to try these despite the mixed reviews. The sound quality for music is great as expected but not so much with calls (my main reason for purchasing). The person on the other end sounds far away and echo-y and the range isn't good. If I'm more than a a foot or two away from my phone (literally sitting in front of it to standing up) the crackling noises start over whatever I'm listening to. These aren't cheap and I'm disappointed. They're going back.
1,Don’t buy these because they’re like a roulette wheel. The batteries that each earbud runs on can fully discharge for no apparent reason and when that happens they’re useless
4,Work
3,Mic doesn’t pick up voices well at all. Too many people saying “I can’t hear you” when I’m sitting in a silent room. Need to look for a replacement.
5,This product was great
2,I overall really like these earbuds. However; the ANC isn't great buttons can be temperamental connecting issues.Worst was after having them for nearly a year the right earbud just stopped working.
3,Very good company. I love the earphones but the right earbud got quiet and I can't hear much out of it anymore after a month of having it.
5,Good price great product. Slightly disappointed that I can't have more that one device paired simultaneously but overall great experience. Enjoy the wireless charging and good battery life.
1,I got these on May 14th. The right ear bud stopped working before a month was up. Add on the fact that they kept falling out of my ears like I had elves ejecting the ear buds from their domain. Bottom line don’t waste your money. The ambient mode isn’t anything from write home about same with the noise cancellation. Get a different brand Jlabs ANC work best and they’re cheaper. Better sound quality too.
3,Revised bass adjusted and respectable but I can't find a fix for how it picks up wind noise louder than anything.
1,Sound quality is decent and ANC is OK. They seem to be made of poor quality materials and surely don't feel like $80 buds (I bough buds made of a better material for $10 for my kid)However after around two months days during which they were used 4-5 times only the left bud became dead: no charging no sound nothing.I contacted Skull Candy support and they honored the warranty and are sending a replacement (this process is couple of weeks long). Gotta figure out what to do after the warranty if they stop working again!?
2,I really liked the predecessor to these so I figured these would be better. Use either by themselves was my selling point. When I use them I only get one side of the music the side is using. So if I'm listening to a song where the bass is in the left ear and the singer is in the right ear I can only hear the bass if I'm using the left by itself or only the singing if I'm using the right by itself.
2,Left side doesn’t stay in play when trying to charge. Both ear pieces cut out all the time even if fully charged. Just goes silent sometimes for a good 15-20secs and then starts playing again. I’m skullcandy fan but very disappointed in these.
4,Good sound
3,Feel super cheap sounds good but controls are horrible. Couldn’t do it especially after owning airpods....Apple has then down. I love Skullcandy products too unfortunately!
5,I love them!!!!!
3,Ear buds had difficulty linking together and resulted in echoed sound and occasional screeching sounds.  Sent in for warranty checkup. When they worked well we’re great.
3,After a few months of use the left ear bud does not charge.
3,The controls for the them are hard for me to get to work. I think I might just not be use to tech like this.
2,I normally love Skullcandy stuff.  But these things I really am NOT a fan.  I have never had so much trouble getting something to pair to a phone.  I followed the steps on their site and they still wont pair with my phone.  I had them paired for a while but then they randomly stopped connecting to my phone when I took them out of their case.  Wish the app would let me put them in pairing mode rather than following the current method which does not work well/if at all
1,I sent my ear buds into skullcandy over a Month ago and have not heard from them as to even if they received my warranty item.  My ups tracking number says they did....so where tf are my ear buds
5,These are pretty great.  Decent battery life especially when I keep one in the charger box and carry it with me.  Good sound and noise cancellation.
5,This product is definitely worth the money. I can use a left and right as well as the water resistance is great without having to sacrifice any of the sound quality. Would definitely buy again for someone else.
5,Very happy with these! The battery life with the noise cancelling off is awesome! And the noise cancelling is almost as good as having ear plugs in..
1,**Edit** April 28 2021 - I cannot get both earbuds paired at once. I've manually tried to pair both but only one connects each time. Very annoying issue. Highly upset because at one time I thought Skullcandy was a high-quality company.I've really enjoyed the earbuds. The noise-canceling and ambient noise modes are both really great! Sound is typical of any Skullcandy headphones. They offer great bass and lows while being reasonably priced.The two biggest reasons I gave this item 3 stars are due to not being able to connect to multiple devices with ease. In an ideal world I like to connect the earbuds to my phone and then connect to my laptop with easier switching. With these I need to forget the earbuds on one device to then pair with another device. The next reason is just due to the weird gestures you need to tap or hold the device to do different functions.
5,These are my new favorite ear buds. Have not had any issues with these. Used them on planes and the anc is great. No complaints and excellent sound quality.
5,I like the sound quality of the ear buds ! For the money it's worth it.  I rate indy fuel  better than the beats!!!
1,Hate these was hopeful for better sound. Im a runner these fall out of your ears forget about it if the wind is blowing at you. The pairing sucks. Constantly unpairing & PIA to get them again connected. One will only pair & only one ear piece will work half the time. these are terrible.On a positive the battery is great. Good for no impact sports don't buy if your looking for something while running....
3,Has issues connecting sometimes and also cut out now and again.....Sound good with custom profile
5,I got these as a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves them and I see him use them every single day which I think is the best indicator they're great.
2,I love the sound quality and feel of these earbuds my big compliant is the battery life is horrible even with noise cancelling off. Also a month into using them my left earbud had completely stopped working. Touch controls still work but has zero sound.
1,I liked how it looked and felt but I found myself in bluetooth hell trying to pair it with my iphone and ipad. I would fight with it on each devise and then suddenly it would pair. After tackling each of those I tried to pair it to my laptop. It was a total fail. I even turned off my bluetooth on my phone and tablet so the headphones wouldn't try to link to either of them. It did not help. The directions said that the left ear piece would flash red and blue when it was ready to pair and it never did. I have never had so much trouble with bluetooth. I have spent two days on this and even tried contacting Skullcandy help which was worthless. I am fed up with the devises and will be returning them.
1,I have had the Indy fuels for less than two weeks.  They have caused nothing but trouble.  I wear earbuds all day at work.  These earbuds are the only ones I have ever bought to cause so many issues. First they would cut in and out when I would turn my head while walking. In addition turning my head would cause static.  Today only one would work at a time.  I tried multiple ways and looked up online forum advice to no avail.  Finally out of frustration I decided to end the earbuds miserable existence in my life and they were destroyed after only two weeks.  Worst earbuds ever. The sound is ok and they stay in your ears.  Beside that they do nothing else right and the touch controls are difficult to use and sensitive in an active environment.
2,The first hour they were really good. I could hear things I couldn’t hear with my old op bullets. I was excited. Then I heard crackling and popping followed by garbled music and a literal shock in the right ear. Took them off and promptly requested a refund. The do sound really good I want to like them but I’m not about to put myself in harms way. Quality control might be an issue on these unfortunately.
2,El control por gestos es difícil muchas veces hay que tocar 3 veces el auricular para que funcione y en mi caso el auricular derecho los toques no funcionan del todo.
3,Good for what it does inability to connect to multiple devices is a big flaw(even the old Indy's used to to this)
1,First off: I've had to return these TWICE in less than a year. Both times one of the ear buds just stops working. Even with light use of less than 5 hours per week in my home sitting on my couch. The bud won't turn on won't charge nothing.Second: Even when they did "work" the ANC made me instantly nauseous. Not that it really mattered because if the noise cancellation or the ambient mode was on the audio would stutter and pop. On both pairs. So the sound quality is terrible. I couldn't even really test how well the noise cancellation worked if it hadn't made me sick.Skullcandy is trying to replace them with a third pair but I really just want my money back. I picked up some Galaxy Buds 2 and they are everything I could want in a pair of headphones.
5,Highly recommend! Music and taking calls these buds work perfectly!
5,The size of the buds is perfect. I love that the case and the buds have tile built-in so I bought a similar pair ( skullcandy indy evo) for my daughter.
2,The sound quality fit and noise cancellation are great. The battery life is a little short but not bad. The main problems are they have a lot of trouble staying connected  to my phone especially when I’m trying to talk hands free and the touch controls are useless other than to pause music and that’s still a toss up. You could save some money and get the same sound quality.
1,Un producto de muy buena calidad brindan un sonido increíble me agrado la cancelación de ruido la vda útil de los auriculares es increíble duré 7 horas con ellos puestos escuchando música y en tiktok sin la cancelación de ruido y la batería todavía permanecia al 50% hasta ahora todo bien y no me arrepiento de esta compraActualizacióna pesar de la gran calidad de sonido que tienen y de los potentes bajos pensándolo mejor no recomiendo estos audífonos mi auricular izquierdo a veces le costaba cargar correctamente a causa de las almohadillas y tengo que durar minutos acomodándolas para que cargue bien. mi auricular derecho dejo de funcionar no carga no enciende ósea no hace absolutamente nada les recomiendo que busquen otra alternativa.
5,The sound quality is amazing and they are definitely noise cancelling. They beat my expectations. My husband got his first and after I tried them I ordered a pair for myself.
2,I cannot get it to reconnect thus believe it somehow broke completely. I was in love with these when I first received them. The noise canceling was excellent the sound was just as I wanted it to be and the fit was perfect.I may have simply gotten a bad one but I'm still quite disappointed since I paid a pretty penny for these.
2,The big issue is the dropped sound every 40 seconds or so. The app helps with the sound quality and makes setup a breeze but with the drop outs and the lag on video feeds makes using these an unpleasant experience.
3,Decent headphones but sound quality isn't compatible with the price.
2,These headphones have caused me so many issues.They’re great when they’re great. But after a bit of use they’ve started glitching out.I can play music from both headphones or the left but not just from the right.Whenever I reset them they may work for a bit but most of the time the issue is fixed but two other issues will take its place.Quite frustrating.
1,One works; the other does not!!!
5,The sound quality is perfect for me and to be able to switch is a nice option. The range of connectivity has been good.
3,Work great  but my left stopped working  it connects but no sound
5,Easy set up. Good noise cancellation and comfortable fit. The audio is good as well. I feel these fit like the inked wired headphones which i love.
5,Cheaper than AirPods sound quality and base is perfect just like my other Skullcandy products from the past. These are the best headphones I’ve owned yet.
5,Totally awesome ear buds - my daughter was right !!  They are very comfortable in my ears.  I love them !!
2,the sound quality is outstanding staying connected could stand to be better.  mowing the lawn and they disconnect.  the phone is in my pocket. they will drop one side or the other.  I have walked away from my phone to where I would have thought they would drop out but don't.  the times they do the phone is less than a meter away.
1,I loved these headphones the quality was great and I loved using them 24/7. I love skull candy so that's why I decided to spend the 140$ on these headphones for the right one to die in 3 months. And skull candy says I have to pay to send it back to them to possibly get a refund?? This is disapointing. I loved the app and everything about it and then the right earbud just quit. I had restarted them reset them and everything I could do and nothing would happen and now all I have is a left ear bud. Luckily amazon is hopefully letting me do a refund outside the return window because this is horribly unfair.
2,Admittedly pairing this headphones was a drag though other than that pretty great. Great alternative to the AirPods if you can’t afford it. A cheaper one at that. Previously used wired headphones from this brand and works great.
5,Great product! Sound quality amazing with incredible base. Sounds like I’m listening through AirPods but over half the price!
5,Love em! Skullcandy did a solid with this one! Sound is great and with noise cancelation I don't hear anything outside of what I'm listening to.
5,Great sound quality the kind skullcandy has always provided. The noise canceling feature is one I haven't experienced before but was Great. Assume for the gym or relaxing very comfy.
5,Sound quality is rich and there is an app to download and adjust to your liking
2,They won't stay paired together the right one randomly disconnects then reconnects a few min apart sound quality is on point but the headphones are barely usable because of this flaw
3,Left ear piece will lose sound sporadically.  For the price I would expect higher quality.
5,Love Skullcandy products.  These fit well and cancel noise really well. Love them and work as well as the other fruity ones at a better price.
5,Perfect. Not too expensive and the tile location for each ear bud has already saved me from having to replace an earbud more than once.
5,Our teenager loves them!
5,God quality sound is not as loud as I was expecting but is good fitment is excellent if you want to use them for the gym.
1,DO NOT BUT Total junk right out the box i had problems does not come with charger for 1 it's a USB charger but it should still come with a wall charger. The pairing will not work you can only get 1 bud to pair at a time I look online and everyone is having this problem. Don't understand how a big company could let this happen. There websight gives you instructions to reset them and they still don't work. Don't waist your money or time! If they paired they would be great but only 1 will work at a time... JUNK JUNK JUNK
1,Great until they stopped working. After a couple months the sound in the right earbud went out. Got a replacement since I had insurance. But the same thing happened again.
2,They don't hold a charge and do not stay connected very disappointed.
1,If I only wanted one ear piece then I would have ordered only one I expected the pair to both work I was quite frustrated to find only one worked
1,I really love the brand so I bought on August 2021 and one month later earbuds stopped working fortunately I could return them to Amazon and they gave me a new pair back now after 5 months both earbuds doesn't charge the case is working but the earbuds doesn't I can't return to Amazon and Skullcandy warranty doesn't cover shipping and they don't ensure anything so trying to use warranty could be a waste of money.... I have Loved all my Skullcandy products before this. I'm disappointed ☹️ I don't think I would get any Skullcandy product again.
5,My daughter loves these and its super happy with the comfort and noise cancellation.
2,Battery life sucks
1,Ive had two both had the same problem - one side continually cut out intermittently.  My 30 dollar cheap no name chinese ones dont do that and are more waterproof.  The tile location thing is a joke wont workman  under lost headphone circumstances (ok for the inconvinient temporary lost in the house useless for lost lost).  One side stopped working on one pair pretty quick.  They are just a total ripoff dont waste your money.Its sad because skullcandy was my go to brand now they put put this junk and dont sell jibs without a microphone.  It was a good run but I'm done with this brand.
1,Brand new out of the box had issues getting the case to charge and the ear buds to charge in the case. Finally got them going left over night and earbuds were only 90% charged after 7 hrs. Day 2 case won't charge at all not the earbuds. Contacted Amazon support and just read verbatim from Skullcandy troubleshooting website which me being a semi intelligent person did these steps myself. Waste of time and Skullcandy support... well yeah not really sure you should call it that.
1,The sound quality ps sometimes they just start crackling for no apparent reason or after calls
5,Great customer service as well they back their warranty
1,Although the controls are very frustrating the sound is very good.  however at 6 months the right pod no longer charges....sending in for warranty replacement.  Quality is most important to me so hard to recommend.  If they replace I may change my rating.UPDATE 10/15/2021:Skull Candy replaced my original set.  However the second set is plagued with connection and distortion problems drops the connection to phone during runs for no reason and sometimes one ear bud shuts off randomly.  Though the sound quality is quite good I can't recommend these to anyone as I would not purchase again.  Sadly QA at Skull Candy is not what it used to be.  Lowering my rating to 1 star.
2,Battery life is ok sometimes the ear buds will turn off randomly and sometimes only one earbud will work noise cancellation is none existent it does not work you can still hear things around when noise cancellation is on this is not a good buy when you contact support there AI emails you back not a person. Over all I would not recommend this product
5,Works and connects with ease. Would’ve liked a lil more loudness but I’m using it for meetings more than music.
5,Bought them in April and it's now July and their not charging
1,Im currently on my 3rd pair in 2 months and even they are having issues. They sound great when/if they work. 1st pair had a short in 1 earbud. 2nd pair wouldn't charge due to a mismolding in the plastic and my 3rd and current pair keep losing connection.  Spend the extra and go with Beats.
1,I had high hopes for these buds but they are terrible. The noise canceling works well but will go full static randomly. One or both buds will cut out out at least 4 times an hour. If you’re listening to one bud and pull the other out 75% of the time it will not connect. You have to put the other bud in the case then pull it back out. The buttons are either to sensitive or non responsive. I’m returning these. Downright terrible. Only up side I can find they’re comfy and the battery life is good but I assume it’s because they don’t work most of the time.
1,Sound battery life and noise cancelation are good. They also have an ambient mode so that you can hear whats around you if you want. The thing that brings it down is the pairing. They constantly fail to pair with each other and other devices. Just completely reset them 6 times today and they still aren't working right.
5,And Skullcandy reminds me of why I love this brand. Quality if you couldn't tell hahaha
5,Thanks this is my second pair.
2,No support does not pair with my Samsung Galaxy 9 does not  pair with my Win10 computer the cups on the buds keep on dropping out when I remove the buds from my ears. Do not recommend to bad my return window expired was not able to fully test them until last weekend.
1,So I liked skull candy and was pretty happy to order a wireless pair after my old headphones died.But opening the box it was VERY clear I was given a returnthe buds themselves seem clean but their charging case is scratched and scuffed up already which a NEW box of ear buds should not haveeverything seemed to be with them though. And even though I paid $109 for them and paid for new ear buds I could look past that their not new BUT they literally won't connect to my phone even when trouble shooting and following the directions. I will give a day to see if charging them helps and if they still fail I will contact for a replacement .
1,I had mine for a little over a year and a half. I was not rough with them in any way. I basically only ever wore them while I was working. One day a few weeks ago the left bud just flat out stopped charging. No reason why that I can think of. I cleaned the contacts of both the case and the ear bud looked inside the case to see if the pin had gotten bent and nothing that is obvious to me is wrong with them. Honestly I would expect better from a well known company like Skullcandy and up until this issue they were great. But i'm not looking to have to replace earbuds every year or so. You might want to look into something else if i'm going to be honest.
1,This is the second pair I've bought and one earbud has completely stopped charging or pr working at all.
5,They work perfectly and with the added ear pieces they fit perfectly as well. Money well spent.
5,She loves them for working around the house or on the go.
5,Worth every penny.The ANC works very well the case is small pricepoint for quality is excellent.One complaint....do not like the Bixby connection.
5,Good sound quality noise cancelation and battery life. I use them daily in a noisy environment.
1,Piece of garbage. Headphone charging connections corroded in less than a month preventing me from charging the headphones. Have to clean them using needle nose tweezers qtips and alcohol. Once the connections in the case get corroded badly (i can already see discoloration) i suppose they will be literal garbage. DO NOT BUY THESE. Save your money!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             the left ear piece does not charge
1,Love that’s they canceled out noise
2,I have noticed that these are good for music but I am not heard in phon ecalls. They feel like knock off airpods.
1,The left side came missed up and it starts making a static sound every now and then
5,Had a few issues with them but they are pretty much what I expected
1,Bought this for a recent trip as my previous pair of headphones died. Was excited to use these but unforntantly they didn't pass the functional test. My ears would consistently lose connection to my iPhone and stop working mid-use. I bought them for the plane and they just wouldn't work. It was hit and miss and I would have to dock the headphones back in the case and repair them to get them to work. My recommendation is no matter what great features they have if they don't do the simple connect via Bluetooth and play music/video it doesn't matter what telse they do.
5,Work great. Brand new. Work with my Galaxy Note like a charm does not work with game systems
1,Sound and noise cancelation was good stopped charging after 3 weeks
1,Sounds good and last a long time but only one ear bud plays at a time. It says to take out of mono mode and it don’t do anything. It only switches from left to right. Will not play both
1,They keep going out with static coming threw speakers.
2,They work and sound great! But every time I use them it seems they have a buzzing that is irritating. If you turn noise cancelling off and on again it goes away but they shouldn't be doing that in the first place.
5,Love them! Sound quality is great and the battery life is great
5,They're just what I expected.
5,Everything I was looking for. I already liked the brand but these are amazing.
5,These are perfect for my small ears! The most comfortable earbuds that actually stay in while active!
2,Did Not like. The touch controls we're a terrible idea and the Bluetooth doesn't support multiple devices.The noise canceling was not great and the sound quality was not good at all.The also don't come with small enough rubber boots for my ears so they hurt a lot during use
5,This product has served well for my use! I have them in all the time.
5,Love this product! Noise canceling feature is awesome!
5,My husband loves them!!  They are exactly what he wanted!  Very pleased!’
1,I've owned 4 pairs between November 2020 and July 2021.Warranty takes about a month to have a working pair in your hands again.1 stopped charging the earbuds1 stopped charging the case1 stopped charging via USB-c to USB-cMy current pair now has intermittent sound in one earbud.Great sound great battery life all around awesome product.4 failures in 6 months doesn't seem like good manufacturing or quality control. I keep them clean use them gently... This is absurd. I'm done waiting a month to have music in my ears again.
5,Good product
5,No complaints  They work great.  Love the noise cancellation feature
1,I had them for a couple months and they were doing fine the last week I had problems charging the right earbud
5,Right bud stopped working after only a few months!
5,Love these headphones for work
2,These ear buds would have been fine except they would NOT stay connected to my phone by Bluetooth.I repeatedly had to reconnect- 3 times I totally took them off Bluetooth & reconnected.Totally frustrating
2,They sound great. But for some reason they don't charge properly after a while. These are my second pair at first I was the left one giving me issues but now it's the right one. Does someone know how can I resolve this issue
2,They worked for a couple months and then the right one stopped charging. Reached out to seller and after several weeks no response.  find something better.
5,La calidad del sonido es buenísima los bajos se escuchan muy claro
5,This is product is amazing. I was impressed with the sound quality.
2,I loved them at first. Now after a while they get a weird popping noise and whoever your on the phone with can hear it. They also don’t stay in my ears no matter which tip I put on or anyway I put them in my ear.
1,I was a long time fan of Skullcandy and bought one of their first true wireless headphones. They were awesome until the right headphone stopped charging. I would return them and get a new set but the right headphone would stop charging after about a month. Eventually I wrote them off.After a couple years I decided to to try their new model thinking it would be improved. It was! I didn’t even have to wait a month for the right headphone to stop charging it didn’t charge from the start!
5,Changing the soft rubber sizes are important for sound quality
1,El producto fue comprado el 7 de marzo de 2022 a los dos meses ya no funciona el auricular derecho no prende es una estafa de producto.
5,Excellent quality! I love it!
2,It was working amazingly. Helped me a lot while working in an office setting until 3 months later the charging case stopped charging the right ear bud completely. I love them but can’t use them.
5,Este producto es utilizado para trabajo muy cómodo
1,The earbuds at first worked 2 weeks into use it stopped wont pair and terrible sound quality and experiencing quality issues and can't return within month of purchase
2,Terrible about having laundry interference noise and loss of signal.  Hard to navigate settings and functions unless you use the app.  Damp Hoodie brushing against it while jogging or working causes it to skip stop Chang mode ect...  really disappointed in them.
5,I will definitely get but them again
2,Sound quality is fine but they don’t last nearly as long as I would like them to.
2,It o ly connects to one phone and most professional workers have two. A personal and a work phone. It keeps disconnecting from the one phone it will pair with. I should have just spent the extra money on AirPods
1,Do not buy this if you are looking for ANC hearing protection. This device does not do that. There is no noise cancellation. All it does is play sounds from a Bluetooth device like music podcasts or phone. If you want it for hearing protection in a noisy environment you need to find something else.Product support is awful too. You'll get a rep whose idea of noise cancellation is to play music at a lower volume. They refuse to put you through to a supervisor or a real technician.
5,Normally any Skullcandy product will be a dice throw but these work fantastic!
5,Los mejores que he tenido  el sonido Fabuloso
1,Wouldn’t even stay in my left ear with any variation of the fittings it comes with. I went for a run with them and it was not enjoyable having to keep putting it back in my ear every 30 seconds after it continually falling out. Also the plastic case is made cheap and poor and is large. I returned them after a day lol.
1,Two returns already and i give up. Same issue in every pair. Constant static and shorts in right ear bud. Throwing these 100.00 buds  in the trash and will never buy another Skull Candy product. They also make you you pay for shipping their defective product back with tracking so there's another 16-20 bucks down the drain. If you are inside your 30 day return window do yourself a big favor and get a refund -- they will quit working and very soon!
1,Have the decency to clean them before shipping used ones. There’s was so much ear wax on them I almostThrew up. 🤮
1,those are fake and don't even works when u pair them with bluetooth said u need a app to used and its no the skullcandy official app
5,Well worth the money. Great bass.
5,The bass on this are incredible.. didn't think would be that good.
1,- earbuds fall out too easily without any physical activity regardless of size ear gels or use of stabilizing ear gels- painful to use stabilizing ear gels- battery life with ANC on is only lasting me 4 hours at most- controls are difficult to use
5,The best headphones I have ever used are very comfortable.
2,I have used skullcandy growing up most my life an i never had anything as terrible as these bluetooth earbuds. the static noise is the worst part. they need to fix that bad!! such a let down :(
1,Uncomfortable even with different size buds. Noise canceling doesn’t do anything. I’m returning these. I’m just going to pay more and get the Bose. At least they are wearable and work.
2,Decent but none of the buttons work as they are supposed to and the right ear piece has audio problems to the point where you cant even hear it. Not even 3 months of use
2,No es lo que ellos dicen
5,Well worth the money. The end
1,I have had these for 3 months. The right bud will no longer charge. I have conducted the factory reset and cleaned the contacts on the earbud and the charging case. The left works fine the right is totally dead. They were never dropped or abused. I use them 5 days a week at the gym. My only option is to work with Skullcandy for warranty assistance.  I have had always had great success with wired Skullcandy - wireless - I would look elsewhere.
1,What a HORRIBLE experience. I have been looking forward to purchasing these headphones and was finally able to order them. Upon opening them I was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED. First of all the earbuds were in the case and not in their designated spots. When I removed the case from the package I found an uneven number of silicone tip replacements. When I opened the case I found USED earbuds with EARWAX in them!! Not what I ordered! To top it all off there was no charger included. I will be purchasing from a different store. This is absolutely ridiculous.
5,no dislike great earbuds
1,Compre un par y eran usados aparte de que no funcinaban bien. Luego me los cambiaron por unos nuevos sellados pero al pasar unos meses presentan los mismos fallos del primer par. El audifono izquierdo tiene problemas de carga( creo que terminara como el primer que me enviaron no cargaba) el audio es interrumpido por un sonido desagradable parecido al sodino de estatica pero es mu desagradable. el bluetooth se desconecta.
5,Would Recommend!
5,Great product.  Happy with the quality.  Highly recommend.
1,I had these for 3 weeks before the sound quality faded and now these are my lowest volume headphones I've ever owned. Pair that with the bad touch design and uncomfortable buds. Will not be buying skullcandy headphones again. Waste of money
5,10/10Been a fan and customer for years now.
5,Really noise canceling!
1,Ear buds will stop charging in a few weeks. This was the second set I had first one did the same thing after a couple weeks. These starting having issues 3 weeks in. Don't buy. Sound quality was really good so it is too bad Skullcandy can't get the charging part right. Also the company itself doesn't seem to concerned. Had two reps tell me to refund with Amazon.
5,Sound is awesome
1,Left bud stopped charging after a month of use. Cheap garbage.
5,Nice noise
1,I’ve own these for two months now and they’re finished. The left ear-bud will not charge what so ever. You never know if the ear-buds are charging when you place them back in the charger. The red light comes on the right ear-bud but not the left. And there is zero help to fix it. Move on to something else and spend the extra $20 on something more reliable.
2,Music will randomly cut off and back on. Happens when on data and WiFi and with downloaded music.
5,Fantástico!
5,Better than the beats
1,The charging box doesn’t work anymore. No idea why it stopped working. Now my pods are dead and I can’t charge them. I wasted my money big time
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This true wireless the firts timethey really sound very good the sound cancellation is decent the ambient mode is ok  I don’t have a month of use and the left earphone no longer want to charge when i place it on the charging base a red light flashes and does not stay fixed as the right one normally does.Can this be changed?  I’m not in the United States I live in Dominican Republic I bought it through a courier.I don’t buy more skullcandy
2,The headphones Bluetooth connection cuts out often. Leaving you with what sounds like a broken speaker. Even when the phone is in your hand.
5,Very simple easy to recharge
1,It is great that Skull Candy warranties their stuff because mine broke in a matter of days to weeks each time.  Horrible quality of build.  They stop charging the bluetooth often struggles to stay in sync.  Each time replaced and had hopes that they would work better...only to be disappointed again.  Don't buy these!!! You will experience the same frustration.
5,Good quality
1,After using these earbuds for 3 weeks the left earbud stopped working. The controls to lower volume from the left earbud kept working. LED on the left earbud would still turn on. The sound and ANC feature would not work on the left earbud. Everything on the right earbud would still work. Tried resetting the set disconnecting from my phone pairing the earbuds with each other pairing with other devices. Nothing would bring back the left earbud.
5,My bf loved these
2,Bought these for work. Can't move around because they fall out. Doesn't fit snug.
1,I liked these while they worked. They are good sounding earbuds. But at almost exactly 6 months one of the earbuds went completely dead. Will not power on charge light doesn't come on when stored in case. I am very meticulous about taking care of my electronics. These are just duds. Apparently I'm not the only one having problems with them.
1,Just got them on the 11th and it is the 21rst they hurt my ears like to the point it hurts even more to take them off the left one stop working and so I only have the right one. The left one won't charge in the pod and no there is nothing blocking it from the pins. So like 10 days and one already don't work and I already regret getting them. Bad buy... To much money not worth it.
1,Don't know if it's bad pairing with Motorola stylus but same problem missing more that half of whatever  I'm playing while I'm at the gym.Missed window to return it my bad.Also took too long to write a review. Sorry for whom this would help make a better choice than me.
1,I have used the corded earphones for years. They work great. I tried these and they are not great. The wind noise that came in around these earbuds was half as loud as my music. Very disappointing. I tried switching the rubber ear pieces and got the same result. Sound quality is awesome but the noise cancelling stinks. If you’re standing around at work or in the office these are a good contender if you’re outside and the wind is blowing or you’re on your skateboard/bike whatever forget it. Very annoying.
5,So comfortable
5,Great product
1,Severe issues of various kinds I was a big fan of Skullcandy and bought a few for my family as well. Every single one has different issues.From weird noises through disconnects awfully annoying to pair every few times.And now the pair I held onto the left ear is just dead.Awful earphonesI hope Skullcandy rethinks this and fixes it up.
1,Everything about these are great. Until they start having a constant loud static/clicking/interference sound when connected to my phone OR computer. Also seem to not pair equally from one ear to another. Sometimes one will have the issue and the other won’t. And it’s says and they make a big deal about them being TRUE WIRELESS. NOPE. Horrible connection issues.
5,Great no issues.
1,Counterfeit earphones
5,Worth every penny.
1,Loat ear bud first time I wore them now I only have one.
5,Amazing sound
5,Very nice
5,Good 🙏🙏🙏🙏
1,Researched alternatives to Airpods. Felt confident in these. Two months very happy. One day right one flickered with sound then stopped working altogether the next day. Reached out to Skullcandy. One week no response. Reached out again response will get back to you later with a confirmation. That was a week ago. Still waiting. Would not recommend Skullcandy products due to their customer service.
1,They sound great but they keep shutting off on their own. They unpair from each earbud causing you to lose sound on left right or both. You will eventually find a YouTube video to show you how to tap them 4 times on each bud and pairing them all over again but it eventually does it again. Frustrating and not worth the waste of time.
1,They never pair up correctly after adding re adding and and syncing  one of the sides stop conencting. Very annoying.
1,Los audifonos funcionaron con normalidad por 2 meses luego el audifono derecho dejo de reproducir sonido hice de todo para ver si se solucionaba pero nunca volvio a funcionar aparte de eso por su precio la calidad de sonido no es tan buena y la aplicacion para configurarlos no funciona
2,Sound great but Bluetooth calls suck i had to disconnect them every time i had a phone call
5,They work great.
1,Don't waste your time or money on this useless junk this is my second set and it has the exact same problems as the previous set I have returned. I find it hard to believe that this is a true skullcandy product and if it is then they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this crap to people! Extremely disappointed
1,I am not even sure why I bought these headphones. After using it for a few times I started noticing more and more problems with it. The headphones are not in sync at all. Touch gestures are not responsive. When I'm on a call my voice is not transmitted properly to the other end. Battery life is poor. The case looses it's charging within a day. I am confident that the more I use these headphones the more issues I'll come across. Can I return these headphones and get a full refund please?!
1,Sounds! Great! Good for listening none wire! But the biggest issue of product starts having issues with connecting with the connection with the sound waving the left side of the earbud like it seems like it died completely connection!!! won’t hear anything and same results still having issues after a week you purchased!!Cost a lot of money for a poor product that causing problems connection of the wireless and will not last longer with this issue!!!
1,I purchased three pairs of these and had issues with connectivity and audio quality. When connecting to a phone call there is a huge delay before it will come through so you’re murres for a second when answering. Audio is low to the caller.
1,Batería no dura mucho tiempo como dice en la discreción
1,They worked fine for about a month the left earbud would disconnect randomly then reconnect it self with in 5 seconds which is mildly annoying. However the left earbud now doesn’t play any sound which seems to be a common theme in skullcandy products.
2,Just over 90 days and the left ear bud stopped charging.
1,Havent even had them a month and one of the ear bud is already not working correctly. It cuts in and out and crackles and sometimes doesn't even work.  Very disappointing  that they didnt last long. Hopefully we can get a replacement
1,My only issue is that it sometimes pairs itself to my devices while still in the case with the lid shut even with a rubber band holding it shut...this runs the battery down and annoys me considerablyUpdate- they have been returned...charged overnight turned them on and the left bud gave me a low power warning...nope don’t need the hassle...
1,Left hear bud did not work when I got it. I was disappointed
2,Ear buds keep disconnecting from my calls
2,Case dose not close all  the way
5,Sounds great
1,Definitely a miss here. Connectivity issues during every use even paired with a brand new phone. Charging case doesnt completely work. These honestly were more annoying to wear because of the connection issues alone. You fooled me because these were no better than their 30$ version of buds. Looking to switch brands. I got duped. Oh well. 🤷‍♂️🤙
2,Eat piece rubber breaks easily
1,These things are absolute trash not even worth The money only good for music but still the yard absolute trash your music pause you’ll have to turn them off and on and on top of that they are absolutely useless for phone calls I would not recommend these at all
1,The contents was not the right items. What's more it has lots scratches on it. It's obvious that this is an wrong broken used earbuds. I'm so upset for receiving this lo-fi product. Think twice beforeyou buy it! I encountered so many ups and downs and still don't get what I want. Saaaaaad.
1,Within 2 weeks of them being delivered my sound quality went down as well as volume level. The right earbud had already blown and had to keep the volume at minimal levels to listen to music. Unfortunate because I’ve always loved Skullcandy products and used them for years.
2,Great except I couldn’t keep it in my ears
1,They have been a pain in my ass from day one. Uncomfortable and somehow they went to solo mode. Now they won’t go back to stereo. I have went to the support page and YouTube. 👎
1,The bluetooth connection is completely unreliable and they don’t charge well. They also don’t stay in my ears.
1,Paired fine to my iPhone but it will absolutely not pair to my iPad Air 4. I've tried every troubleshooting online help available and it still will not pair.If you have an iPad spend a little more and get the iPod Pro. It may cost a bit more but it will work!
2,I bought this product on 11/4/20 and the right ear bud has completely stopped working. Very disappointing.
1,Read reviews they don't pair together even after reseting.
1,Great headphones..... Until they quit charging. No support aside from scripted responses from the support pages but I need to ship them back to Amazon or something to get them fixed
1,The audio and ANC were great quality but the build was not. These lasted 6 months before the right ear bud fell apart in my ear. For the price and how long they lasted I do not recommend.
1,I mean they were really great while they worked for the whole two weeks I used them. And then the right ear bud but just won’t charge. The left one still charges. But kind of pointless to have noise canceling just one ear.. Also it just dies all the time also.. Junk
2,Very uncomfortable fall out very easily Bluetooth connection poor not pocket friendly
1,I've been happy with the many wired Skullcandy earbuds I've bought in the past. With this wireless pair the left earbud shuts off literally every three minutes - and I'm using these with my computer as I sit stationary. Since I didn't keep the packaging I can't even return them. Complete waste of money.
1,First the charging case had problems. Now the right earbud won't charge. I'm pissed that I am having issues because these are actually really great earbuds. Return window closed already so I know I'm not going to get any help with them. Its a shame I wasted the money.
1,Connection was difficult with my IPhone would frequently disconnect. Tried to troubleshoot multiple times to no avail. Then one earbud would just not connect all together. Stopped working after less than a month. Complete waste of money will be returning.
1,worked great for about 3 uses then right ear bud died and there support tells you you have to pay to ship it back to them to fix it. I have always used skullcandy's and this is my last pair. Going with Samsung now.
1,Couldn’t keep a connection for more than a second RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX or if the phone was more than a foot away. So so terrible.
1,I sent them back because they hurt my ears.  I guess my ears are sensitive.
1,It’s very unfortunate I have bought 3 pairs of these and only one pair worked. I seem to be having problems with the left earbud on the 2 pairs that I bought. It just stops working and won’t charge.
1,I realized I meant the INDY EVO earbuds. These ones appeared to work fine.
1,They seem to constantly lose connection when you’re around other blutooth devices (like at the gym)
1,Just don’t buy them lol 😂 they are GARBAGE!!!
1,It didn’t work
1,broke within 1 year of use
1,Decent sound but eventually one malfunctioned and would not work anymore so I returned them. Don’t bother buying them. Try a different brand. Only thing good was the noise cancellation
1,Not worth it earbuds refuse to pair to each other specifically the left ear bud. Tried to follow Skullcandy's instructions to pair them but did not work. For the price it shouldn't be a struggle to pair both earbuds together.
1,First the left side now the right side. Won’t charge
1,These are garbage. I had a pair of AirPods that I loved and they got washed and ruined. Thought I’d try these cheaper ones. Big mistake. They don’t fit well and the quality is just not even comparable at all.
1,The left headphone won't charge any more and when I tried to use the warranty the website spit back some stuff about a missing token.
1,The tile part last registered the left ear piece on a bridge and then it never charged. I would like another that will continue to work. I have contacted them
1,While it functions fine for music or blue tooth it’s connectivity to incoming calls is garbage. don’t waste your money spend another 100 and get the noise canceling apple pros. night and day
1,When they did work they were amazing. Unfortunately the wiring on the right ear bud was a bust and stopped working immediately after syncing.Got a dud.
1,Audio sounds distant and low quality no bass the cheapest alternatives are much better battery life is only high because volume can't get very high mic is terrible for no reason.
1,Worst earphones i’ve ever hadAfter a couple weeks of using it’s speaker feel like they’re tornAlso they’re uncomfortableOnly pro that they charge fast and noise canceling quite decent.
4,This is  my first pair of wireless earbuds and I'm so amazed at the sound quality and easy setup.  the ambient sound feature which allows you to hear sounds around you beyond the headphones is great when on the bus or subway to hear what's going on around you
1,The right ear bud stopped working out of no where like it won’t connect or anything the sensors still work but it just won’t connect
1,DO NOT BUY! These have very good sound quality. Very impressed. Had them about 2 weeks when the left earbud went out. Couple days later the right would not charge.
1,I disliked the fact that I waited a week to get the package and the earbuds won't sync with each other. Sending them back and buying a different brand.
4,These earbuds are great when you want to listen to music and block everything else out. The sound can be a little piercing on some songs but the app can solve that issue. Skullcandy makes the best earbuds for any price and these are worth it!The left earbud sometimes doesn't charge if you put it in the case quickly you gotta make sure the earbud lights up before placing it away. Clean the earbuds and case frequently to ensure that the earbuds charge correctly.The warranty process is great but kinda long they have the best customer service I've experienced. As long as you remember when and where you bought a pair of earbuds you will get a replacement. The longest I've ever had to wait for a replacement is a week.
3,The sound and durability is good in these ear buds. My negative remarks come with the Bluetooth connection issues. I bought a pair for myself and my husband and we have both had connection issues. I have had to reset/reconnect my Bluetooth connection between my phone and buds 5 times now. It is annoying feature that makes you wonder if I put this ear bud in there is a good chance is may not connect and I will have to trouble shoot what is wrong. I would not recommend this product there is no consistency in the Bluetooth connection and it can be frustrating not a dependable product.
1,Broken non functional with app due to having to pair separately
1,One earbud quit working and this is my third pair waste of money
1,One headphone didn’t work and they felt very cheap
1,The case does not charge the earbuds past 10% despite being fully charged or plugged in.
1,Terrible doesn't even turned on was immensely disappointed because I like skullcandy
3,I'll keep them for the fit (adjustable) but I'm on look out for bass-y headphones.
1,They suck always falling out of my ears. Always disconnecting and always gets a horrible static sound from them
1,Sounds good but left side worked for maybe 30 seconds and wont charge. Maybe make a headphone that charger goes into each and not a garbage case
1,Connection issues doesn't pair.
1,After less than 6 months the left earbud won't turn on.
1,Couldn't use them - they were WAY to large for my ears :(
1,Sound quality very low...plus only the right ear  earpiece working
1,Changing my review to 1 both of them stop getting charged. I thought Skullcandy was a good brand. Not anymore.
4,Hurt my ears a little tho
1,They won't even turn on now just after I passed the 30 day return window
1,Absolutely horrible product. Microphone is useless in and out connection. 1/10 would not recommend. Over priced for quality.
1,Pairing is a mission impossible. I watched every video available but nothing worked. After 1 h of trying I initiated the return process.
1,Sent them back
1,Right ear bud within a week sounded like it was under water little to no sound
1,Don't waste your time and money. I was much happier with a $40 set of tozo earbuds!
1,They were great until one of them stopped working about a month after I gifted them to my husband.
1,It's not made for the gymThey need to improve on the volume and keeps falling out my ears
1,Extremely cumbersome to pair and operate.
1,Save your money!  Waste of time trying to set them up! Would not stay connected to apple phone.
1,The sound is going out and Ive only had them for about 2 weeks
1,Solo me duraron 15 dias y se dañaron
1,Only 1 works
1,Bad product
5,Skullcandy is the brand you will see at the electronics section of a local Ross or a discount department store or in clearance in your local Walmart Target and Best Buy. Skullcandy is for me well known as cheap and decent sound quality. Indy ANC is pretty much the step in the right direction it's affordable ANC for a decent price. Skullcandy provides decent sound quailty more focused towards bass but vocals and instruments are still clear and can be heard. Personal Sound is a nice touch and actually works enhancing the music experience which for me works really well. EQ is alright with the 3 options is: Music (bass heavy while listening to music however can be used for everyday like watching YouTube etc) Podcast Mode (focused towards vocals if you're listening to an audio book or podcast or some sort of content that only has vocals this will make vocals more clear do not use this while listening to music) and Movie mode (depends on your needs few people might perfer this mode then music as for some people music mode makes vocals less clear however this 100% depends on your need). Overall really good app can be improved as it has 2 stars in the Play Store and also release a firmware update for customized eq like Anker and other brands.
1,2 months old will not charge total garbage
1,1st pair stopped working got a replacement and those didn't work either
1,After a week can barely hear right ear bud.
1,Right earbud stopped charging and died after about 5 weeks.
1,They were staticky and did not work for me
1,Stops charging after a month
2,I bought my Indy ANC earbuds from Costco.  They might have been in the $80 range - which I'm expecting some level of quality for that price on earbuds.  They have always been difficult to connect - you have to go through a whole process to get them to search for the device and if you have another device nearby that has ever connected w/them but you want to connect them w/a new device - you have to delete the connection or turn the initial device off because it will always default to the device it already knows.  It's a pain if you use them w/your computer and your TV - and/or your phone.Another problem is how easy it is to set them in their charging case & have them a little out of place - when you go to try to use them one of them is already on low batteries & dies on you.  Very frustrating - there's nothing to indicate that it's not charging properly once you close the case - it would be so easy to have an indicator to let you know that you need to adjust it.Last - I've had these for about a year & now the real problems are beginning.  The volume started to be weaker on one side - now it's both of them - I can barely hear the TV show I'm listening to.  And the final end of life for these buds - one of the buds no longer charges at all.  I just opened the case and only one of them will light up - even after wiggling them around.I think for the $100ish price range I can probably do a lot better than a one year life expectancy - and maybe I won't have to deal w/any of the other issues I had with these.I might recommend Skullcandy if you just want a $20 pair of earbuds that put out sound - the cheap earbuds are fine.  I would never recommend Skullcandy if you want to spend more than $20 on quality earbuds -- If you're looking at buds in the $100 range - pay an extra $20-$40 and get a better quality brand.
1,I did not receive a c-cable to charge the device.
5,Battery life and sound are just awesome
1,Left one stopped working 3 weeks in
1,Worst earphones ever made!
1,I just wanted a simple pair of decent sounding earbuds to wear on my bike and while working out.  These 'buds have been the most aggravating devices I've ever owned.  I've owned Skull Candy wired buds in the past with satisfaction and good value.  This model just blows.1) pairing nightmare(s).  I've never had any problems pairing to anything with my relatively new standard Samsung smartphone.  These things have to pair to each other or they show up twice.  Doing that requires no less than 3 steps of blinking lights and commands and touches within seconds.  If  that fails only 1 bud works.  Re-pair?  Good luck.  3 pieces of SCandy documentation and a couple hours of searching Google how one really gets them to work and 25 tries later they eventually pair. For a while. Then they unpair for no reason at random times and it's back to step one.  Factory reset back in the case.  Listen for commands while watching blinking lights - how do even you do that?  One works.  Then the other. Then you factory reset over and over and re-pair and remove and re-pair over and over only to have them "unpair" for no reason.  Strange warning messages on the phone about multiple devices trying to connect.  Every other thing I ever connected said "blah blah request" you hit "OK" and you're done.2) Inconsistent range.  Sometimes it's poor>fair (like 4-5 machines away in the gym) other times the signal can't reach from my pocket to the buds without dropping out fading volume etc.3) Super super sensitive.  If you touch them for more than a couple seconds you are performing unintended functions.  Pull them out of your ear and you reset something inevitably.  And if that thing relates to pairing... see #1 above.  You're in for 30-60 minutes of hair pulling aggravation.  I find I have to yank them quickly out of my ear and let them rest on my shirt wait 10 seconds then touch them again (again just for a second or you'll change settings or the track/stream you're listening to.4) The case is too big and the buds shaft doesn't fit tightly so you've got to babysit them when you put them in the case to make sure they get charged.  Even then sometimes they (again randomly) don't charge and go low battery in 15 minutes.5) Useless on the bike.  You can hear OK but receivers say all they can hear is wind noise.  That may be true of all wireless buds so I don't fault them too highly.  I'm not experienced enough to know but my wired buds sure work fine and no noise when riding.6) The app that comes with it is trash.  It only finds and connects when it's in the mood and then it doesn't really do anything.  SCandy never updates the product so that's no use.  It can toggle 'ambient' mode off/on since if you ever bump your hand against them or some random contact you reset their sound mode.Do yourself a favor and get another brand for wireless.  SCandy's wired buds work and sound good if a bit fragile.
2,These did not connect with my computer and now I am having problems connecting to my phone. I did have them connected to phone but they stopped working. I charged them and did all the due diligence. When they were working they worked the same as the cheap pair I had before these. No real difference.
2,These will not pair to pc or laptop. I've tried every trick I've found to try to connect these to my pc and laptop and nothing works. If you don't ever plan to pair to a computer these are good buds but otherwise they are truly lacking in this regard.
3,Good sound quality and good bass. If the bass is lacking make sure you arent in "podcast" EQ mode.Pairing did not work acording to the instructions. I had to first do a reset.I like the fit comfortable and secure.This was my "Ill give skullcandy another chance" purchase. I loved these until I powered them on at my crowded big box fitness center (the main use I have for them). One ear kept cutting out and several times over the 15 minutes I tolerated them I got only scratchy interference for several seconds before music resumed.Havent used them enough to judge battery life.If i wasnt going to use them at the gym Id give 4 to 5 stars on the experience so far.
1,The earbuds constantly disconnect from each other and it's a pain to reconnect!
2,I have had to pairs of these now and overall I have enjoyed them but I have the same issues with both sets they stop charging. I don't use them heavily (1-2 times a week) and the sound and noise cancelling are solid.I did warranty my first pair and now am debating if I should on the second pair. At this point I am disappointed in the product and ready to move on. If they did charge and continue to work for more than a few months I would rate them a 4 on performance.
2,After a couple months only using em a few times the left earbud went out stopped recharging stopped working entirely. Crappy product worked good while it lasted but that wasn't long apparently this is a known issue.
1,Sound is good for the price but earbuds are difficult to sync together. Wish I had returned them within the return window.
1,At the beginning they worked really good almost perfect but after one month of usage they stopped pairing. So now I have only one headphone working. Not happy. Don't buy.
3,I got these as a Christmas gift for my son there really cool but once you try to pair multiple devices it’s really hard to pair not the best
3,I have had two of these sets of earbuds now. And the sound and noise canceling is decent. But I actually spent $130 on these and regret so. I wish I just saved my money to by airpod pros. Some things that I notice are that these earbuds sometimes disconnect and have static crackling noises at random. And the fact that these look very generic as well turns me away from these. And these earbuds are HORRIBLE at connecting to other devices with Bluetooth! Absolutely frustrated with the fact it took my a couple days to connect these to my laptop. I do not recommend these to anyone with an apple device just buy AirPods.
2,I just tossed my second pair of SkullCandy ANC earbuds. WHY? They sound great. They fit well with many ear options. For me pairing was fairly consistent. Personal sound mapping is a great function on the associated app. BUT...the first pair failed to charge R in the case after two months. I returned them and again as new they were great. Now four months later with careful indoor-only use the right earbud pairs syncs but emits no sound. If I open my mouth it turns on. I close my mouth it turns off Wiggling the earbud makes intermittent sound as if it's shorted out. If I tilt my head to the left the R bud turns on momentarily. I tried all the reddit remedies: cleaning resetting draining the battery case all various ear tips blowing on the mesh to prolapse the driver sucking on the mesh to extrude the driver heavy magnet banging on a table etc.  Nothing worked. R earbud is intermittently dead. Past limited warranty window so I went with another popular brand. Oh and sometimes they would be out of sync with each other pushing music out with a half second delay from one earbud to the other. Cannot recommend this product.
2,There are a bunch of connection issues with these headphones.  The first is that the sound starts getting choppy when too many signals are nearby.  Which means as long as you turn off your wifi remove any other nearby bluetooth devices and stand in the middle of a field the sound quality is transmitted from your phone very well.  The bigger issue and the one that ruins the entire headphone is that connecting to your phone/laptop is a HUGE pain in the butt.  It is constantly trying to pair the headphones separately and the process to pair them together is long and tedious.  Then after you have them paired they often don't want to connect (currently the only bluetooth device on my laptop that has an issue with connecting) or if they are connected they don't want to play any audio (currrently connects to my tablet and just won't produce sound).  The Skullcandy app is garbage the touch features are horrible and the control you have over the sound is nonexistent.  I have a couple $30 bluetooth headphones that I prefer over this pair that is 3x as expensive.  And the Samsung buds2 absolutely blow this pair out of the water.If you're still thinking about buying these after reading this I would suggest going online and searching for IndyFuel issues (pairing connectivity control replacement protective mesh or anything else you can think of).  Just buy a different higher quality pair or fall back on a simliar quality but vastly cheaper brand.
1,Neither earbud will charge nor will the case. Neither can be powered on. Sounded pretty good for about 2hrs. They have a design flaw that if they get completely drained they may not charge. Skullcandy knows this and should remove it from the market instead of trying to cash garb.
3,These are just ok earbuds…they won’t connect together so sound only comes through one earbud. I’ve reset them so many times and they are still not cooperating like they’re supposed to.
5,I really enjoy these headphones. I bought a pair s I was drawn by the price. The noise cancellation and ambient mode both are excellent in their own regard. Bass is good way better with noise cancelling on. However I fell in love with was the SkullCandy brand: The pair I bought was faulty where the right side headphone would not recharge unless the case was plugged in. So it would die and the left would be all I had. I reached out to SkullCandy and they shipped me a replacement it was easy to setup through their website and the new set works great. I was impressed seeing that this brand usually sells the cheaper option. Sidebar I have the AirPods Pro and these are comparable in noise cancelling and bass when activated. If you needed to save $150 this is great option to do it.
4,Bought these at Costco on sale. Absolutely loved them.Sound quality I thought was okay until I found out you can customize it for your own ears through app.Game changer! Loud beautiful sound for all music and my taste is very diverse. Bass is bumping for the electronic pop and hip hop but refined enough for my classical jazz and bluegrass.The problem is the battery life. 2 months in it started not charging fully (or maybe it was draining in the charger). Any how I would pull them out with a full charge and the meter showed 40% on the reg.That's not acceptable so I returned them.
2,Lamentable no cumplió mis expectativas luego de 7 meses de uso el auricular izquierdo ha dejado de funcionar y la conectividad o el trabajo que hay que realizar para que se vinculen ambos en un poco tedioso por lo que exhorto a que corrijan esa partes para los futuros productos que puedan lanzar.
1,complete waste of money. not even after a month of owning the left ear doesnt play music anymore and they constantly disconnect from your device and is really hard to reconnect. complete waste 80 dollars
2,I don't notice the noise cancelation at all. One side is much louder than the other and I've tried cleaning them resetting them switching rubber ear pads nothing helps. Makes me not even want to use them! Very disappointed that I even wasted my money on these!
1,Bought these. They were great for the first hour. I wanted to test out the low end on these headphones so I decided to play "a milli" by little Wayne. A good track with a killer bass drop (I'm a real bass head)...Once the bass dropped there was an audible crack in the sound quality. "Ok" I thought. "No big deal it's probably just the equalizer getting broken in"...Boy was I wrong...All of a sudden *ZAP* *ZAP*.....before I know it I'm waking up disoriented in the middle of my living room floor. I was out cold for 3 and a half hours. "What happened" I thought to myself. Looking at the earbuds sprawled on the floor next to my I slowly began to realize...The bass from the little Wayne song was so intense it shot a component of the left earbud straight into my eardrum throwing off my equilibrium and sending me into a daze. I fell back hit my head and was knocked out cold. Do I plan on suing skullcandy you ask? No. Not quite. Skullcandy is not at fault. The real culprit is Bangladesh. who is this you might ask? Bangladesh is the man who produced the cursed little Wayne song I was listening to on that fateful day. He is the one to blame for this "mishap". I use the quotation marks around the word mishap because I feel like he knew what he was doing when he produced that track and decided to add that ear shattering bass to the song.What can I learn from this? I am a single father of 7 beautiful boys. Life has been very hard for the tykes and I. Especially without a mother to help take care of them. You see my wife took off on us about 6 months ago (around the time of the "A Milli" incident). She never appreciated a good bass drop like I did and she definitely was not a fan of Mr. Wayne. Maybe if I took my wife's advice things would be different for me...maybe if I had just laid off the bass I would not have found myself in that predicament laid out on my living room floor in a puddle of my own piss bleeding out of my left eardrum. Things would look a lot different for me today if I had taken her advice. Maybe I would have three less kids if I had listened to her. "My body can't handle this Rick" she use to say. You see I always wanted a large family. I was an only child and life was hard for me growing up. I use to sit around and play with mud and wish I had a brother or sister to sit in the mud with me. I think that's where my love for bass comes. You see music was my best friend. Music was the only one that kept me company as a child. I would always love the feeling the bass gave me. The warmth it would give me. The "tickle in my pickle" I would receive when a particularly heavy bass line would play. Sometimes I would play a song with lots of bass and rub my wee wee on the family sound system because I loved the way it made me feel. I was an odd child. Odd but lonely. Bass was always there for me. My one love my true best friend. Bass would never leave me or run off like my wife did. Now my one true love turned into a nightmare thanks to skullcandy and Bangladesh the producer of "A milli".If you got this far thank you for listening to me and beware. If you buy these headphones DO NOT listen to "A Milli" by little Wayne with them..
1,This product sucks they do not pair or sink at the same time no matter how many times you go through and erase it from your phone turn off the pods turn on the paws re-sink they never sink at the same time only one will sink so if you’re cutting your grass with a headband down all you hear is one at a time when I finished cutting my grass today I fixed it by taking a sledgehammer to them
2,I did not buy these on Amazon but I did buy them. I paid a  little more than listed price here and by the time I learned they were garbage it was too late to return them.  They constantly unpaired with each other causing them to fail to function. One ear works one doesn't and the it completely shuts down.  You have to re-sync them again and again and again and it's just not worth it at the price point.  There are better options that work - might cost more - but its worth the lack of aggravation these cause.  Also what's the point if you can't use them?  Garbage.  Just garbage worst $$$ I've ever spent.  Support from SkullCandy is a shame too. Sure it fixes the device for about 10 minutes then it's doing it again. 32 hours of battery time because you can't really use them.
1,Less than 2 months in and the left earbud has crashed again. This is the exact same issue I had with my previous skullcandy earbuds which these replaced.
1,I love the sound and the noise cancellation in these BUT PAIRING SUCKS. I literally have to watch 3 youtube videos every time to figure out how to get them to pair with a different device. Maybe if you bought one pair for device you'd be fine.Example: I went on a road trip two weeks ago. I did not take my laptop. the last device my Indys were paired with was my laptop. I had no cell on this stretch of road and spent AN ENTIRE HOUR trying to pair them with my phone. I took each one out individually and held down the "button" until it said "power off".  I took each one out individually and tapped 3 times 4 times 6 times nothing worked. Then I tried endless variations: taking them both out at the same time to try taking the left one out first instead of the right. Nothing. I didnt end up using these for the entire trip because i couldn't get them to pair with my phone.WHY is there not a button to "reset paring" somewhere or SOMETHING!? I love the shape sound and noise cancelling but I cannot buy a pair for every device.
2,I am repeatedly forced to forget reset or reconnect.  Often only one bud works.  Though the sound is ok the constant pairing and re-pairing was too much.  I threw them away.
4,I really wanted to love these headphones for one very simple reason: With the Personal Sound feature Skullcandy have one of the best audio optimisation tools I’ve ever experienced. I first tried it with my pair of ANC Crusher over-ear headphones and once you’ve taken Skullcandy’s hearing test and the app has created an optimised sound profile for you you’ll never want to go back. It’s spectacular. I have severe tinnitus and really struggle to hear certain frequencies and most ‘dumb’ headphones that either don’t offer adjustable EQ settings or only have a few default presets are useless for me. I don’t have default ears. My ears are screwed up and I need the sound equally screwed up to properly enjoy it.Now here’s why I can’t bring myself to love these things: it’s the fit. My hearing is screwed up but I think my ears are pretty standard physically. Earbuds usually fit me comfortably enough right out of the box with the standard tips but there’s something about the Skullcandy Indy buds that just don’t sit right with me. They’re not particularly uncomfortable and they’re certainly not painful but no matter how long I wear them I’m always *aware* that they’re in my ears. Most mid- to high-end earbuds I’ve tried fit well enough that I can almost forget they’re there but I haven’t found that with the Indys.It’s a real shame as the sound is truly spectacular once you have your sound profile dialled in. The battery life is great the app is perfect and the sound quality is impressive at this price point but I just can’t get past the discomfort. I don’t blame Skullcandy but I’m a little mad at my ears right now.
3,Sound quality and noise cancellation are great. The battery life is on the lower end but is forgivable given how quickly the batteries charge and that you can charge them on the go with the caseIf you intend to pair these earbuds with a single device then these will probably be great for you. If not understand that what a migraine it is trying to connect to different devices.The typical process is like this. Say you have your earbuds connected with your computer and you want to go for a jog and connect them to your phone. Even if you open "bluetooth and other devices" on your computer and manually disconnect the earbuds there's a 95% that they'll fail to automatically connect to your phone. Instead you'll need to tap and hold the earbuds for 4 seconds to power them off. Then you need to open your bluetooth connections menu on your phone remove the earbuds from the paired devices tap both earbuds simultaneously and hold them for 7 seconds until you hear "pairing" then scan for new devices on your phone and add them. This is required EVERY SINGLE TIME you want to "plug in" your earbuds to a new device despite the fact that the manual claims that placing the earbuds in the charging case and removing them automatically puts them into pairing modeIf the battery life was an hour shorter or the noise cancellation feature wasn't there I'd say these earbuds aren't worth the money or hassle. As is it's just barely worth it but I'd look for alternatives first
1,They suck they do not staying at the same time save your money by something else
4,I have always slept on skullcandy for some reason... I'm really glad I took the leap though because these are great sounding full feature ANC earbuds especially if you are a basshead.My favorite features are:-The look (matte black; so Batman)-The fit (it's easy to dial in your fit)-The noise cancellation works as well as my sennheiser hd450-Ambient mode is super useful.-The skullcandy app isn't a buggy mess like I thought it might be.-The Audiodo personal sound profile is great and really does work. It's not as gimmicky as it sounds.-Tile support!-the overall sound characteristics. I like how full rich crisp and bassy these are. It filled a gap in my collection of headphones. Most of the headphones and earbuds that I have are more neutral sounding and I've been missing that thump. These legitimately rattle my brain at higher volumes.What I don't like:-As a few have noted these DO NOT have multipoint and will not connect to a second device unless you UNPAIR from the first device remove Indy ANC from the BT list and blah blah blah... it's kinda lame that it's not multipoint compatible and it's baffling that the pairing/unpairing process is so convoluted. Thankfully this isn't a huge issue for me as I have a lot of headphones and I primarily got these for use with my phone but YOU should be aware that this a thing.That being said initial pairing was fine and you CAN pair to different devices it's just a bit of a process compared to other wireless earbuds.If you're looking for wireless earbuds with "pro" features like ANC Ambient mode sound profiles wireless charging IP rating these are pretty much the best deal out there.
2,I'm currently laying in bed at 7:30am writing this review after struggling yet again with these earbuds.I am honestly at a stand still with how far Skullcandy's line of products have dropped in quality.I've been a long time customer and have truly loved Skullcandy's products over the years. They always gave the idea of quality at an affordable price. -But man has that phrase completely flipped in the past two years.These are some of the worst buds I've used in their lineup.Pros:-Sound great as always! I'll give em credit there. They seem to forever get their sound quality just right.-Lightweight and comfortable in the ear.Cons:-The buds disconnect constantly! It's like the two of them can never stay paired. It's surprisingly worst when you're laying down or even sitting still.Backseat car rides... they stay paired but one of the buds is bound to just cut out at random.-Either the right or left bud will shut off completely go silent or start making crackling noises.-They will unsync at times making audio not pair up in each ear.-The only way to 'MAYBE' reset them is by stopping whatever it is you're listening to take them out your ears open the case put them back in the case close the case wait 30seconds open the case back take the buds out put them back in your ears and then wait to see if they go back to normal. *But even this method doesn't work sometimes.-Sometimes if you move your head around they'll randomly pair back up......... either in sync or not.*it's kind of like when you snag a wired pair of earbuds and it messes up the audio connection to one one ear bud. So then you have to flip and twirl the wire around until you get sound in both buds again.With INDY'S it's exactly the same! The wire is just invisible.I've tried everything! I keep them charged try the case resetting unpair them from my phone repair them etc. I can't get them to function normally.-And apparently this is an ongoing problem amongst many. I find it hard to believe there are people out there saying these are great.I can only assume those individuals don't mind the problems themselves or this is just their first Skullcandy product ever.I've defended this brand for yearssss! I can't express how great some of their older products were. It was amazing sound at such a reasonable price. I still own a selection of older headsets headphones and earbuds.Trust me... the old Ink'd generation one series (while wired) sounds just like the INDY'S except you don't have to fight for them to work. -And they were like $15 back then at a Toys R Us.My INDY'S cost well over $100 at a Walmart. -And I can hardly get them to work at all. I'm lucky if I can get a song or two in without bobbing and weaving like an idiot trying to get the buds to repair.Why are they so expensive? Did nobody at HQ test these before they were released? They feel like a prototype to something that has yet to happen.It sucks so badly to see how far we've come and have fallen.Skullcandy you guys have seriously done some damage here. These buds are no way worth $100. I'd be lucky to spend $20 on these. They just don't live up to the hype or the price.For $100 there are better options out there for wireless bluetooth sets.I would definitely not recommend dropping any money on these... at least not at the prices they're asking. If they are a 'must have' however I would wait for a significant drop in price. I myself feel ripped off for having spent tripple digits.I put too much trust in the company going in blind... I should've read reviews prior too buying.This experience alone has made me consider the option to explore new brands. I feel Skullcandy has become too wound up in becoming so big that they care very little about what they're releasing and their customers in general. Very disappointing.
5,Skullcandy Indy ANC earbuds are the most amazing earbuds I've ever used. The sound is deep clear and simply beautiful and the physical comfort beats all others. I had an issue where one earbud would periodically cut out and both would revert to an awful static. Skullcandy support had me do the usual reboot re-sync etc. and when that didn't seem to cure it they continued to stay in touch follow up and suggest ideas. They released a firmware update that has solved the problem. Every step of the way their service was friendly courteous and they seemed genuinely concerned about my satisfaction. Thank you for making a fabulous product and for backing it with top-notch support!!
2,Fits my ears well holds a decent charge but the mesh screens inside the earbuds will occasionally clog up even if you have clean ears. One earbud shorted out after 1 (one) drop from ~3 feet.
1,The sound is static if you don't have the Skullcandy app it sounds distorted and can't make out words being spoken on podcasts. They have a battery life that's is about closer to 7 hours with any function on. Had it for about a month and charging case just stopped charging can't charge my headphones so they're useless now. Wouldn't recommend.
2,Amazing sound quality! Like some of the best earbuds I've had! but they just keep loosing connection with my phone and computer and each other. One will randomly stop working and the other keeps playing music. When this happens noise canceling is turned off so it is extremally annoying. To fix it I have to place them back in the case and reconnect.
5,I have tried several different wireless earbuds from inexpensive to flagship earbuds and I have to say that these pleasantly surprised me.I just want to start out by saying that I have used these earbuds for about 6 months with no issues.What you get in the box is the earbuds with a charging case and the cable to charge the case and earbuds. These earbuds are actually pretty affordable compared to other earbuds and I have to say that the sound quality matches those of earbuds that are in the higher end spectrum. I think the case and earbuds look stylish and the earbuds match a similar design to the first generation Apple Airpods.The noise cancellation of these earbuds is okay it is not the worst or the best. You will definitely be able to tell that the noise cancellation is on but do not expect every sound to be drowned out.Overall I am very happy with these earbuds they are affordable and sound way more expensive than what they are. Although they are not the cheapest pair of earbuds I think they are worth the money. If you can get them on sale I would say do not think about it and go for it. I hope this review helps you make an educated purchasing decision.
3,I've had several sets of wireless earbuds; this is the first set that where the earbuds unpair from each other all the time. When this happens only one earbud will work at a time.On their website they say "The biggest challenge with true wireless earbuds is ensuring your buds are properly connected to each other and your device. There are times when you may unintentionally disconnect the buds and change their paired state..."Umm... yes this happens to me once or twice a week and it's frustrating because to resolve you have to reset the earbuds have your phone forget *both* earbuds from the bluetooth list and then re-pair from scratch. I also find it mildly irritating that on their site they say "YOU may unintentionally..." like this is somehow my fault. There's something funky about the way the bluetooth pairing on these things is designed and I think it's a design flaw.
1,I usually liked the Skullcandy brand but these were a pain in the butt… I had to pair both headphones everyday. They were way to sensible and the right headphone stoped working within 3 months after I  purchased them. The silicone ear tips were really fragile since two of them broke. Honestly if I knew this before I would’ve bought a different brand.
2,When they are working they are great cordless ear buds. But unlike another skull candy model these ones annoyingly you have to keep resetting them or they are separate. More of a hassle even then ear buds with wires ultimately. You never needed an hour to get your earbuds charged and working in unison before working them. Would not get this model again.
1,I literally just got these on the 25th for a Christmas gift.  I didn’t open them until the 26th to charge.  All seemed well until I attempted to use them.(1) they do not hold a charge(2) the case does not hold a charge(3) the ear buds cut in and out(4) Mic quality is worse than my $20 pair(5) Distance won’t even cover the span of a room.  My $20 cheap pair went almost across my house 2700sqft one story.  They also would go through my cement siding and these can’t make it from one corn of a 10x11 room to the doorway(6) The case does’t shut unless you take the little rubber ends off and even then I still had to wrap a Velcro tie around it.(7) The cost of these are double that of a big box store selling these same exact pair for half of the price.  That’s almost $50 more.(8) Even on a non-holiday week day you can not get ahold or receive a response from the people who you’re supposed to contact if they do not work.My husband wasted $100 on these thinking he’d be replacing my $20 ear buds that have lasted a year and the left one just went out.  Do that math keep in mind these are a name brand and my others don’t have a name you can even say and don’t even come with service if they are broken and yet these are worse than the flea market knock-offs you pay $8 for.I have always had and loved my skull candy wired earbuds and have had many many pair due to the wire getting kinked losing them or whatever.  These are a poor excuse for a product though and it’s practically theft that they sell these for $98.  For that cost you expect good quality and that is not what you will get with these.
1,l bought this product and after the 4months l got it started to wear out and the battery started to last less time. l won’t buy this product again.
3,So lets just say sound quality features battery life etc I loved these. They were daily use for nearly 2 months. I expected to be writing a wonderful review of them and would love to but one of my earbuds broke. At least i think it did. Maybe it was that side of my charger that broke and didn’t recharge the bud anymore. The problem is you have no way of telling. Because the charger is molded to each side of the earbuds so you can only place the L on the L and the R on the R this means you can’t. No way to swap the bud to the other side to see if your charger went bad or the bud. Also means if it was the charger there is no way to charge these back up.  While Skullcandy offers a good warranty I can’t tell you the quality of the process or how it works since I mailed them to Skullcandy 18 days ago and they still say they don’t have them.But with that aside while they were working they were great. The ANC is really effective and I liked using the Ambient mode for still having an ear out for the kid while listening to a book. Breaking within 2 months no matter which part broke though doesn’t bode well enough to be comfortable recommending them without caveats mentioned before.
4,- these fits very well in the ears and good for sports use as they don’t come out easily- As per me these are bass heavy and adds that extra thump to music- very easy to pair with iPhone and app was easy to install and use . It can be used for anc on/off and other settings like ambient- operations are easy but takes couple of days to get used to .  You can tap the left earbud to reduce  volume  or the right earbud to increase volume. You can tap either bud twice to play/pause audio or three times to answer/end a call or activate the voice assistant.- Bluetooth 5.0 is good for connectivity- ANC feature is moderately effective. Works with low volume noises but it doesn’t work as well with noisier places- overall it looks like made of plastic  looks durable but appearance is ok- charging is quick and worked well with my wireless charger as wellIt is priced right for the sound quality and ANC feature and lot of other good features
1,These are on sale for half a C note at a major warehouse store and now I know why. They suck.  The sound is okay but I think my other bluetooth earbuds (which don't charge wirelessly and aren't sound-isolating) have better sound.I had to re-pair these repeatedly because they weren't connecting properly when I pulled them from the case and they were acting screwy.The controls are really hard to get used to because they use capacitance to detect being tapped (in a specific spot on each earbud) and of course you can't see them to tap them (try touching the same 1/8-inch spot on your ear repeatedly.) You have to do things like tap tap and hold tap twice tap twice and hold etc to do things like answer calls pause skip forward and backward etc. The volume only responds to a single tap and if you tap more than once it means a different thing. Imagine. Don't sorta miss on the first tap because then you don't know if it registered and now you've done something completely different.No size of the variously-sized ear thingies fits my ears correctly and they all hurt after a few minutes.Worst of all when I'm walking with my phone in my pocket trying to listen to a podcast they cut out like they've got a short in them. I called support (the guy was nice) who wanted me to reset them which I did multiple times. We decided I should exchange them for another pair. The replacement pair had the same problems. Back these go.I really wanted these to work because I liked the case and the wireless charging capability but they're too much of a pain.Edit: typos added a few words
1,Paired them to an old phone once I upgraded to a new phone I tried to pair them and they wouldn't pair and the official support was not helpful in the slightest
1,The audio quality is fine. It's a bit low but fine. However these give me constant pairing issues when swapping between devices the volume is quite low and the "personalized sound" that they advertise is tied to using their app of which the sole purpose is to invasively sell your data. If these weren't a gift I'd return them.Edit: 6 months in and the rubber housing detaches every time I take these out and they're both showing signs of being blown. I only feed high-bitrate audio through these non-boosted. I knew Skull Candy was junk that was masquerading as designer gear but now I'm even more positive. Literally all I said was don't buy me Skull Candy but here we are.
1,it's possible I just got a defective set but I've never seen so many problems getting earbuds to sync together they always show up as separate bluetooth devices and I have to go through the reset/repair steps multiple times every time I use them to (sometimes) get them to work together. to be fair both buds work great on their own if you are deaf in one ear you will love them
3,I love the sound quality of these earbuds.  The noise cancelling ability is also fantastic.  My main complaint and reason for returning these is the fact that I have had intermittent issues with pairing them to devices that I have routinely used them with.  The final straw is hours spent using every troubleshooting method available on the manufacturer's website but still being unable to pair more than one earbud at a time.  No matter what I have tried only one will pair at a time.Also these are great for music but beware that if you are using them through a cell phone call quality is terrible.In short I'm disappointed to have to return these because the sound quality is amazing.
4,I'm a huge music fan and am always on the look out for a pair of headphones or earphones that really accentuate and bring out the nuances of the vocals and the instruments (like a certain high dollar set does) so it almost feels like you're sitting in the front row. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how close these come to that benchmark. The bass is solid the high notes sound amazing the vocals come through clear and crisp.I like how they stay in my ears without causing pain or falling out and how the noise canceling filters out the stuff going on around me but still lets me hear if someone calls my name.These are great especially at the price point. They're quality but not so expensive that I'd stress over losing them the way I would over a more expensive pair. 4.5 easy stars.
1,These are the worst sounding earbuds I have ever used. They are complicated to control with the Morris code tap stuff you have to memorize to use the features which are useless in themselves. Ambient mode squeals so bad you wont be able to snatch them out of your ear fast enough. the Bluetooth connectivity is weak and intermittent. The signal cuts out consistently if I put my phone in my pocket. Purchased mine from Best Buy so I'm pretty sure its a "genuine product". I really feel you'd be better off with a better brand I know you get what you pay for but they cost way more than they are worth. I knew I was settling when I bought them but expected they would be at least useable. I was wrong. They are absolute garbage. Reached out to skullcandy and they did respond quickly but I'm not convinced its even worth the hassle to send them in for warranty. A quick search of the issues I had with them are apparently very common. Save yourself some disappointment and time and just purchase a more premium product like airpods or something.
1,After less than six months the left earbud has completely died. Will not charge or turn on. Before this had constant problems with low volume in one ear. They connect/disconnect from each other and the touch response is poor. They are not compatible with windows as a headset only as a listening device. Just a bad purchase. I've bought headsets for less than half the price as these that lasted longer and sounded just as good and had better connectivity and compatibility. I saw these on sale and just made an impulsive decision since I wanted some nice ear buds. Bad decision.
1,I got these as a gift a while back and have had nothing but problems. The rubber part around the ear bud comes off really easily and if its not placed exactly as it was the earbuds wont charge. It seems everytime i take them out of the case i have to re-pair them to my phone and it takes a long time to get it to pair correctly having to try again and again until it seems to randomly connect properly. The earbuds dont stay in your ear very well no matter the size and im constantly having to push them into my ear which triggers the tap button controls. Sound quality is mediocre at best the battery life is pretty good though. The tap buttons are a bit sensitive and if i try to sleep with these my pillow somehow pauses the song changes the song or changes the volume. Ive been having so many frequent problems with these I thought id write a review warning others of the design and software flaws. I cant believe the price of these its definitely not worth the trouble just to use them. I feel bad someone paid $100 to buy me these...
5,If you like skull candy you will like these. it has their signature profile as I call it. the bass is a bit punchy as you would expect HOWEVER what I did not expect was for them to also have pretty darned good mids and highs and the punchy bass does NOT distort/warp/muddy the mids and highs. good job skull candy.you go in my top 5 with these and that takes a lot to get their! case is a good design. I like the shape and style of the earbuds this is VERY personally specific and the only way to know is to try but for me they fit my ears very well. noise canceling is "ok" not fantastic but good enough. might not be enough for take off and landing for example in a jet but should be decent in a medium busy room or during the regular portion of a flight.Battery life is adequate no issues of course the case is a charging case with its own battery so they recharge when you stick them in the case. no issues paring and so far no crashing and no ear to ear disconnects (this used to be a problem in the early days of wireless buds but seems to be something they have fixed lately in general good solid connection)Overall i am pleased. these might give my ugreens a run although they cost a lot more. overall pretty darned good!
2,Here's the problem with both my skullcandy wireless these and the "Push" is to make a stereo pair you have to connect one I think the left then take the other out and don't pair it or it won't connect to the other and you can only use one or the other. And don't pair them to two devices omfg they'll never work. I have to reset them and start fresh every time I try to switch from phone to tablet.Seriously try Jlab air AMC longer battery easy pairing active noise canceling. Yeah skullcandy sound decent but JLabs is no slouch and much cheaper and reliable
3,These are my favorite earbuds yet. They worked very well for about a month. The right one will not charge or turn on at all anymore. I don't know how to fix this and I cannot return them
1,These headphones are perfect for the individual that wants to purchase a set of something but only have part of it work at any given time. One earbud will work approx 70% of the time. The other will work about 12% of the time will. Skull candy will tell you how to unpair them and re-pair them. This process does nothing to fix the problem but hey at least they wasted an hour of your time and hope that you forgot why you called. When that doesn’t work they’ll suggest you don’t use the product while around things like workout equipment other people trees open fields full of grass your own home or place of work or anyplace where oxygen is present. Once you’ve abided with all of these completely normal requests you’ll find that both headphones have increased in usage from 12% to 12.7%. Well worth it.After hours of arguing they’ll say “well hey we will replace them for you! Just pay to send them back to us and wait 8-16 weeks and we’ll send you another pair (plus shipping). Oh and you better have your receipt from purchasing them or else there’s really nothing we can do. So pay is $40 to cover shipping and we’ll send you the same piece of crap that still won’t work. We know it won’t because it was designed so poorly that it will never work properly.”Seriously don’t buy this crap.
2,I've bought Skullcandy headphones for a while my last pair was the Crusher Evo's which if you haven't experienced the bass on those things you're missing out it's truly insane. The pair I had before that were the Ink'd Wireless that I used a LOT for 5 or so years mainly at work. The right ear bud died so it was time to upgrade.The first ones I bought were the Sesh Evo buds they were okay but they just wouldn't sit in my ears correctly and at work I'm very physical. So I returned them for the Indy ANC buds which I did not buy from Amazon but Target rather.ALL CONS: They fit better but hurt after a few hours and as others have stated the connection CONSTANTLY dropped for a few seconds at a time. The "touch" controls absolutely sucked never ever wanted to recognize my inputs. The noise cancelation was okay at best. I work in a loud environment and the ANC microphones were constantly being overwhelmed producing a crackling noise which got annoying fast.Pros: Sound quality was pretty decent. Battery life was really good.Conclusion: I always had respect for Skullcandy products but they need to focus on their earbud line and reduce the number of different options and focus on maybe 3 or 4 options giving them optimal quality there's alot of competition out there and these guys are dropping the ball. I returned the Indy ANC buds and bought the Sony WF-1000XM3's so far it's been a night and day difference in quality and performance for about $40ish more.I would pass on these.
4,These headphones are good but not great. The sound quality is good enough for the average person but not as good as others on the market although I don't think they are supposed to be. The ANC is nice to have and works well to cancel out ambient sounds more than the passive noise reduction it already does. They fit fine and and stay in place during workouts and I like the design of the earbuds. Battery life is fine and the wireless charging case is a nice touch.
1,I have not viscerally hated a product this much in a very very long time. Even thinking about them makes my blood pressure go up!1. The nifty charging case holds the buds so well that they will NOT come out. If you still have the ridiculous little silicone flange (more on that later) you MIGHT be able to grab that to pull them out after 3 or 4 tries and only if you have fingernails. Otherwise those babies are stuck in there till the cows come home. You can even turn the case upside-down and shake it and they will NOT come out. PITA!2. That little silicone flange I mentioned? Yeah notice that none of their newer products have that. BECAUSE IT WAS A TOTAL FAIL!! It's thin and floppy and nothing really holds it onto the bud so once the bud is free of the case that little silicone thing will do everything it can to be free of the bud. Usually in the dark when you take the bud out of you ear and the thing goes flinging off into the darkness to who knows where. And oh yeah they made it out of a sort of semi-translucent gray silicone that is virtually invisible so good luck finding that baby.3. The 'tap' function of the earbud - PITA. Unless you can see the side of your head (I know I can't) it's next to impossible to tell if you're tapping on target or not. "Hmmmm. Was that two taps in the center of the bud or one off center and one on? Should I tap again? Harder? Tap and hold? How do I start over.4. These things would NEVER pair with my nearest device. The instructions for "pairing" refer sometimes to pairing the two buds with each other sometimes with pairing the buds with your device.5. I could go on and on. Basically this is a product that is still in development and should never have been foisted on the consumer!!
4,These are my first ANC earphones/ buds. Didn't buy them here but paid the same price. I was skeptical about earbuds being able to stay in my ears like various wired earbuds I've used which sometimes fell out. These haven't with the tips already installed they include extra tips of different size. Calls are clear on both ends. Music is actually pretty good on these. The app that these connect to is the winner for me. You can basically do a hearing test for each ear and it will customize each bud. The ANC although seems iffy to me. Still good buds in my opinion.
1,Amazon blocked my last review which was 100% appropriate. Let me be clear. This is a terrible overpriced product that anybody doing any amount of research will easily avoid. These headphones should be priced at about $40 based on everything I included in my blocked review. If they were $40 I still wouldn’t purchase them. There are much better options. Amazon is a terribly company.
2,I had these for less than 6 months before the case stopped charging. When they worked they really did have great sound quality. HOWEVER. Most of the time I turned them on or the YouTube video/Spotify song/any change to a new sound to produce… there was an AWFUL electronic static that was so bad it would make your ears ring because it didn’t happen every time. You’d forget. Then EEEHHHHHHH ERRRRR EHHHHHH. The noise cancelling feature is truly great. It’s a shame Skullcandy couldnt make an earbud set that could last past six months. No I didn’t get the case or earbuds wet. No I did not drop them. No I did not do anything I wasn’t supposed to do to them that make them cause these problems. These issues were out of the box day one. Shoddy.
4,The presentation is nice the container and charger is great. For the controls expect to carry around the cheat sheet for a while its like learning moors code. I did have to change the size of the ear pieces and the other wrap that covers the outside I had to take off for some reason it was not comfortable for me. So night quite the Apple quality but these are pretty nice wireless ear buds.
1,These are hyped as these super high-end ANC waterproof great sound quality endless battery life wireless ear buds.  Total disappointment.The sound quality is good.The automatic noise cancelling does very littleDespite all the instructions about all the buttons do regularly is stop playback (but not start it up again).  Getting to Ambient Mode or ANC off is EXTREMELY difficult.But all of this would be FINE with me and are nothing compared to the two worst problems.1) The battery life is terrible.  The buds can come out the case supposedly charged and send up a low bat warning in less than 2 hours.2) But the very worst worst worst--the killer that makes these an emphatic DO NOT BUY! is that one or the other sometimes both will drop out while I'm within 3' of the Blue Tooth receiver.  Sometimes they come back by themselves sometimes you have to put them in the case to reset.  It's continuous constant and unacceptable for ANY wireless headphone but ridiculous for higher-end ones.I've been a BIG fan of Skull Candy stuff wired and wireless.  My on-the-ear headphones are amazingly good and as comfortable as any on- or over-the-ear headphones I've ever had or used going back no joke 50 years.  But I still can't wear then for too long and prefer ear buds (these are at least very comfortable).  Yet the Skull Candy wireless on-the-ear headphones are stone-cold reliable with excellent sound good battery life and never lose connection unless I go too far away.  So it has been terribly disappointing and I'm looking for something else. (I have Otium buds for bicycling but they aren't ANC)
2,Bought these at Target on sale but wanted to spread the review to other places. Especially since I had to use the warranty on the first pair due to charging issues.Soundwise these headphones are real good once you set up the personal sound option. The bass is robust and you can change the mode depending on if you're listening to music movies or a podcast. Also the fact they have Tile included in case you lose them is a huge plus.The downsides to these are everything else though. These are by far the most uncomfortable earbuds I have ever worn. When they aren't irritating the heck out of my ears that battery life is pathetic for the price. I bought a pair of $35 ones on Amazon that last almost twice as long as these and yes thats with the noise canceling option turned off. If that was turned on these wouldn't last long at all. The charger doesn't always make a good connection with the earbud so many times I've gone to put it into my ear just to be greeted by a creepy female voice saying "battery low."To say I'm disappointed is an understatement since Skullcandy is one of my go-tos for heaphones/earphones but the poor experience with these may be enough to turn me off the brand. Stay away from these unless they go on super sale (like maybe $50).
2,Touch controls don't work at all! (Like 1 in 50 touches registered) and then always voice assistant.Fast connect doesn't workmy Google buds connect immediately and these are always 2 or 3 seconds for left ear and another another 2 or 3 for right ear. Left ear cuts out randomly.0pen some apps and then when on ANC starts making weird buzz.Can't close lid on charge case unless tips are perfectly aligned and they never were after wearing so I just left lid open to charge.Tip fell off and lost when bud fell out of my ear while bending over from about 1 foot from ground and lost in grass.Pain in arse to setup and sync with Tile had to try 3 or 4 times for each side.ANC okay but not great. Phone calls people said they could here me just fine.I returned them after one week. Don't bother
1,I wear these for yard work and when I move about turn around bend down stand up the audio cuts out like It's losing Bluetooth communication with my device. I also use these two listen to music as I fall asleep at night. Again when I shift position slightly they cut out.I haven't been able to get them to work with phone calls. I'm busy doing what I'm doing listening to audio from my phone someone calls and I have to stop what I'm doing take my phone out of my pocket turn off the Bluetooth and disconnect from the earbuds so that I can take the phone call through the phone. Unbelievably frustrating. The whole point of these is wasted.If I touch them just right they unpair from each other and there's no way to pair them without putting them back in the case. This is extremely problematic if I'm out on a run or at the gym or on an errand or in the car or in the yard... so basically in order to avoid this you have to take the case everywhere you go. So stupid.Even when you do have the case it is extremely complicated to get these two pair together again. I had to go online to a bunch of different forums and none of the solutions worked. This was after I went to Skullcandy support online and was on successful following their own directions.All in all these are horrible. Don't waste your time or money.
1,I have wasted so much time trying to get these things to pair correctly. Usually only one will work at a time. Given the number of videos devoted to fixing this problem I'm guessing I'm not the only one. Sometimes I can get them to work correctly and then I will go to use them the next time and spend another hour fiddling with them. Ridiculous. Find a better product.
1,They wouldn't fit in ear right and kept falling out no matter which of the little rubber pieces I used. They would never pair with any device together it was either the left side or the right. Never could get them to work together. I gave up and just tossed them. I lost my money on these.
5,The noise cancelling on these does help but it's fairly mediocre.  It's only really effective if I'm also listening to music to help drown out the outside noise.  With the music playing I can just barely hear my finger snaps.The real star of the show with these is the audio quality.  I've always been a fan of the Skullcandy earbud audio and these ones live up to my expectations.  The bass is nice and strong and playing with highs and mids does not drown them out.  Even with the noise cancelling enabled there's very little noticeable distortion.  I ended up turning the noise cancelling off just to get the best audio quality out of these as I can.I like that it comes with quick equalizer options.  Podcast mode completely dropped out the lows and all I heard was the voice.  It does a great job of cutting out background noise.  Movie and music mode were fairly similar but I liked music for my purposes.Overall these are among the best Bluetooth earbuds I've tried.Highly recommended.
1,Works great... until it doesn't work anymore. One bud ALWAYS just... dies. Won't charge won't turn on won't connect won't reset... just sits there dead. This is my fourth pair with the exact same issue. It's a defective product and I don't think it's a stretch to ask skullcandy to replace them with a different device that works.
5,Love them at first the lowest volume was a bit too loud but then I disabled absolute volume controll inside developer options on Android. And now the phone and headphones each has their separate volume. Now I have have it really low and hear my surroundings.
1,I bought two pairs of these from another source one for myself and one for my wife for a very good price.  I did not want to spend the huge amount of money for the product that came from the manufacturer of our phones.  I started having problems with static buzzing and cutting out. My wife’s pair were fine. Tried to re-initialize a number of times to no avail. Thought this might be a fluke. So I returned my pair to the vendor and got another set. This all transpired in April 2021. The new pair was better still the occasional static but much better than the previous pair. However in the last couple of days the left side now will not charge gives a “low battery” warning and then disconnects.  And trying to address this with the manufacturer is like getting a root canal with no Novacaine. And just for informational purposes the ANC is virtually nonexistent. Spend the money get the best. Just returned the third pair of these to the source I purchased them from (not Amazon). Run away!!!!! Do not buy!!!!!
1,I loved these and wore them at work off and on for 6 months. Left ear bud wouldn't charge unless you jiggled it around in case then just stopped charging completely. Not really worth the money. Lost receipt. Threw in trash after finding out the warranty process is a nightmare.
5,These little earbuds have mighty sound! I haven't had any experiences with Skullcandy before but these are great! They sound very clear and I didn't hear distortions. I haven't really experienced loose earbuds before I'm only used to the ones with a cord so I know I won't lose them. They charged fast and instantly paired with my phone. The instructions were clear with big pictures so I can see which directions are for turning on off or pairing mode when setting up. These would make a great gift to someone else or a gift for yourself!
1,I bought these from Costco and am regret it every day. I can't believe Skullcandy Bluetooth technology has actually gotten worse; they constantly disconnect from my TV (no other BT headphones I own do this). They randomly cut out into an abrasive maddening static. The controls are so unintuitive and backwards that I find myself going back to using my 10 year old $25 wired headphones.
5,Love my pair! Nice bass noise canceling and easy to connect to your phone. Comfortable and I like the silicone tab which helps keep it in ear when working out or hiking. Highly recommend.  (Got mine from Costco for $60 recently so definitely get them there instead of here if you want to save some $$)
2,I bought the Indy ANC Noise Cancelling ear buds. I hear annoucement saying noise cancelling is on. What a disappointment I hear people loud and clear talking 100 feet from me. Audio from my laptop at normal level I can hear the same as being 15 feet away.  Not a fraction of decibel is being cancelled. I read other  people review of how great noise cancelling is. May be I got scam getting a different model than what the box says. The music sound is good enough so I give it a 2 Star.  Would never Buy skull candy products again.
1,I have to re-pair these things ever other time I use them the manufacturer directions don't work I have to go to a youtube vid for working directions. I have a cheap $15 pair of bt earbuds that don't have the quality these do but they actually function. I've chosen corded buds over my indy fuel bt earbuds many times.
1,The headphones itself is fine when both pieces pair correctly but they don’t. You can only hear from 1 earpiece. This is a very common problem no wonder it’s 60% right now.
1,Cheap build.  Bought a set (Costco not Amazon) within 2 months the left earbud didn't work.  Returned it and within 3 months of light use the stability "wing" is torn on both the right and left earbud.  Without that stability wing the earbuds are useless -- they slide right out.  No replacements are available on Amazon or any other source.  Called Skullcandy they said "too bad for you" there are no replacements available and it is not a warranty claim because they are made to wear out.
2,I have spent way too much time syncing both ear buds together. There are youtube videos assisting with this issue but why is it so common for one of the ear buds to lose sync with the other? Sound is good but having to work to sync both ear buds up multiple times a month tells me this product is crap. You will be happier with another product. Trust me.
5,Skullycandy has really developed as a brand from producing inexpensive headphones to actually making nice sounding audiophile quality headphones and earbuds.  These wireless Skullycandy Indy earbuds are outstanding.  The Active Noise Cancelling works great.  The battery life hits right around 18 hours without use of the ANC.  They are incredibly comfortable to wear and are virtually invisible to my ears for hours.  They have plenty of bass with out that bass getting flabby or overwhelming.  They are a bit forward in the mids but it balances perfectly with crystal clear highs.  Love them!
5,I bought these as an alternative to my crushers. I expected sub par quality with buds good battery life and figured I'd get tired of wearing them and dealing with the chore to keep putting in and adjusting.What I got was a amazing all in one package. The buds deliver a clean bass and volume in the lower range. Mids are great. Highs can get a little crunchy at higher volumes. But still better than most buds hope to achieve. They are comfortable and come with inserts to fit the most picky of users. The battery is insane. The finish is smooth on the case and buds. No jagged edges or poor build quality here.I have my complaints though.The app doesn't have a EQ or any noteworthy features other then being able to quickly turn off/on noise canceling.Noise canceling is always on when taking them out of the case. Which makes having to fiddle with them everytime if you want to turn ANC off for that extra battery.More Colors? Gimme mint/Chameleon please.
2,Got these on sale at Walmart. First of all these are my favorite ear buds ive ever owned noise cancellation is great the EQ with the skullcandy app is great.Whats not great:Customer service. Replacement parts do not exist for the Indy ANC as far as I can tell. I enjoyed a solid few months until I inevitably misplaced the charging case rending these 90 dollar headphones useless. I was told by customer support to buy an Indy Fuel charging case as a replacement then directed to their website. SOLD OUT. Thanks real helpful. So bought some Fuels second hand off of ebay. Case is clearly too small to fit the Indy ANC one bud charges while the other does not. So not only is there no suitable replacement charging case but customer support is clueless.
2,These earbuds are mediocre at best.  The sound quality is adequate but nothing to write home about. The Mic is subpar and you sound muffled to the caller.  The absolute worst thing about these ear buds is the lack of pairing ability.  Even after successfully pairing these to a device there's no guarantee they will pair a second time.  If that happens resetting is arduous and time consuming and often resulted in only one ear bud pairing and not the other.  Save your money. Do better Skullcandy these are a rotten product.
1,So my first impression with these was wow Skullcandy hasn’t improved the shape of their earbuds since I was in middle school. All 3 bud sizes that came along could not combat the poor design of the earbud body. It just stabs your earlobe and leaves it sore after having them on for just 30 minutes.I’ve used these for about 30+ hours now and the one thing I’ll give them is that the sound quality is good and the ambience mode really blocks outside sound well. However sound cuts off so frequently while putting your phone in your pocket. I initially thought these were better than 2nd gen Apple AirPods but have rescinded that statement. These are far worse.The most PERSISTENT issue that plagues this device and what’s the real deal breaker for anyone is how many times only a single earbud will connect to your device. I’ve had this issue with my phone and laptop and the issue is only remedied (50% chance) by doing a complete reset (Forgetting Device) and reconnecting.I have not had this issue once with Apple AirPods (any gen) nor with Bose SoundSport Free Wireless which btw is the superior wireless earbud.
5,Air pod pros are pretty expensive these days and these are a great alternative to only spend half as much for almost the same thing. One of the reasons why is that you can wear either earbud on its own which is awesome because I've gotten $200-$300 wireless earbuds that can't even do that. In addition to that the sound quality is great they're comfortable and the case is a nice size. Another thing is that usually if it's not as expensive the noise cancellation suffers but that isn't the case with these since the ANC works just as well as the expensive brands. I recommend these for sure. It's a great bang for your buck.
1,Case stopped charging. I’m done with wireless earbuds. And Skullcandy products.
1,So this is an unfortunate review I'm writing because they're not terribly designed and the sound quality is very good for a set of inexpensive Bluetooth earbuds. However I've had more than 5 occasions where I go to use these and the earbuds will be "unsynced" meaning they want to work independently of each other. This is actually a feature of them in case you want to use only the left or the right bud. However if you want both be prepared to forever be skeptical of whether you will get them in sync. What's the worst part you may ask? Well there's not really an easy way to fix this issue. I've had a couple instances where I couldn't fix them and considered simply dropping them in the trash. Huge bummer folks. Save your money or go somewhere else for BT earbuds!
4,I have been using these for about a month now and I can say they are great. They connect instantly. They sound great. My only problems are the touch interface can be a bit finicky and the ear supports sometimes irritate one of my ears. The fact I can use one bud or the other is great for everyday activities.
2,These do have a great sound quality and the sound can be customized in the app which I really like. However I’ve had these replaced twice because they have problems right out of the box. They immediately have sound issues where the sound get distorted until I turn the ANC off and back on again. That issue will appear upon startup and again anytime I pause my music for any extended period. After a few weeks one of the earbuds will stop charging and will come out of the charge case saying “battery low”.
2,Really Skullcandy? You designed a charging case for an electronic item that is well documented as easily lost and decided to make it close with only a MAGNET??? Despite trying to carefully manage this deficiency the case opened inside a pocket of a bag and one of the earbuds slipped out and became lost after only 2 months of owning these earbuds-- an entirely predictable result.  Perhaps the product team is banking on making this product profitable through constant replacement purchases.Additionally before losing one of the earbuds (and thus all utility for my use case) I noticed that these earbuds are extremely challenged in switching between multiple paired devices.  If you intend to pair your earbuds with more than one device there are alternatives you will find less frustrating.
1,Bought these almost a year ago. My son got maybe a month use before the left one stopped working and nothing fixed this issue. Waste of money. As a single disabled mom this was an expensive lesson learned
1,I've had these a month.  Used their app with the earbuds.  Issues include.Static in both ears.  Tried these with multiple devices -- android apple dell.  The static comes and goesRubber ear pieces fall off.  I assume they expand due to oil on the skin.Need to place them carefully in the charger and watch for the lights to come on.  Sometimes they just don't charge.Only support one device at a time.  So if using multiple devices it is a pain to pair these over and over.
1,Had them for several months.  I liked the wireless charging feature but..... Sound quality isn't good compared to most earbuds much cheaper call mic sound quality sucks and you need a PhD to understand their touch options. Google how to work them expecting a quick answer and you get video responses you have to watch to learn each new task. And even as I tried to convince myself I was ok with all of those things the most frustrating part is they lose sync with each other and the volumes are different on my two earbuds. I've had much better sound and call quality from other$30-$40 earbuds from Amazon. Or for about the same price you can get Samsung earbuds that out perform these on every level.  Don't waste your money on any skullcandy products.  I've owned them since they first started and their quality and service have all gone downhill.
2,One of the features to persuade me to purchase was the ability to manipulate them with taps.  The taps hard rarely work except when accidentally brushing against them they kill your phone call.Can't adjust with taps very poor.....must have the phone app which defeats the reason for the purchase.They sound good and they were on sale so there's that......
1,I usually love skull candy but these headphones suck. I keep trying to reset them and they will not even work while following the instructions. i have apple products. Just spend the extra bit on AirPods pro.
2,These have great sound but are soooo confusing to control one tap two taps three taps fine but then one tap hold for 2 2 taps hold for 3?! The right only allows you to advance in playlist the left only allows to go back in playlist. Forget about noise cancelling and ambient noise it’s like doing a tap dance routine 💃🏼. Hopefully in time I’ll learn th basics and just be happy with that.
2,Have some of their Indy standard (nom noise canceling) wireless earbuds. Those have been pretty great. Got a set of these thinking the noise canceling would be great. Well it did virtually nothing. White noise any noise. Barely noticeable. Then the overall BT reception is worse. The left bud keeps cutting in and out. The connection time is like 20 seconds vs 5-10s for my standard Indy buds. And the case construction seems shoddy - door hinge is gritty and sloppy. Overall very disappointed.
5,These Skullcandy Indy ANC True Wireless Noise Cancelling In-Ear Earbud are very nice earbuds. The ANC on these earbuds works surprisingly well. The audio quality on these earbuds is top notch. I love skullcandy earbuds and these come with the usual exceptional quality that they are known for. The battery life is very good too. They fit comfortably in my ears and I enjoy wearing them while listening to music or watching videos on my phone. These are very good quality earbuds. I would highly recommend these SkullCandy earbuds.
2,For  no reason at all only one side decides to work. They have directions on how to troubleshoot but each time it happens I spend hours going through the steps trying to correct the issue. The buds just don't want to pair together. Ever. Giant waste of money.
1,If you can get these to work they sound decent. Unfortunately all I get is music which cuts in and out... like several times a second.  It's impossible to actually listen to anything this way. I purchased elsewhere as they were on sale for $50 but wanted to provide a review on these here as well as where I purchased them.I paired these with an HP Chromebook Pixel phone and other Windows computers... same clipping/dropping issue. Earbuds were fully charged so it's not a power issue.
1,I have been using this Skullcandy indy fuel earbuds for about 4 months and the more I use it the more that I regret purchasing this one. First of all they don't fit very well with my ears I have tried all three sizes and they still fall off my ears occasionally. Secondly they have connection problems. When I am using them they can get disconnected with the device I am using randomly and connect with my other device by themselves. I would have to turn off the bluetooth on my other device to get them reconnected. Thirdly they are not convenient to operate I am always confused about how many seconds to press it or how many times to tap it to control them. I really don't recommend buying them.
1,Beware these things are absolute garbage with obsolete Bluetooth tech.  The signal is constantly scrambled with interference.  Even with my phone directly by my face the signal goes in and out constantly.  I just turn them off.  They’re going in the trash.
1,Worked amazing first couple weeks….  Hard time connecting.  I solely used them for workouts an outdoor work.  None of the lights work one side would charge an other wouldn’t random disconnects between headphones.  Got to a point won’t even take a charge anymore an I threw them out.  Had better luck out of dollar general specials then these worthless things.  I have the big headset of skull candy an love them had it for couple years now still using  but these are not even worth picking up to look at
1,Their fearless use promise does not currently apply to these buds. They do not have replacement parts and I’ve been trying to get a replacement charge case for 2 months. My case was stolen and I’d gladly pay for a new one but they simply don’t have them. The left ear bud would get static that will not go away until disconnecting and reconnecting after changing songs or pausing a song. They haven’t been very helpful as far as trying to get parts every time I have gotten a “check back in 2 weeks”. Do not buy these ear buds. They are useless without the case.
1,Spent way too many hours fixing pairing issues with these earbuds. They unpair frequently with each other (meaning the right and left fall out of pairing) and re-pairing is well repairing a pain in the butt. The buds also can't be paired simultaneously to more than one device meaning it won't automatically pair between your computer versus your phone depending on which is in use ~ you have to manually unpair from the device you're not using and repair with the device you want to use. I'm super frustrated with them.
1,Case stopped charging one of the headphones after about a month of light use. Warranty process extremely inconvenient and lengthy and lengthy.
5,I found these earbuds easy to pair with my iPhone and once paired I found the sound to be good and the noise cancellation of ambient sound to be very good. I like that this product came with rubber ear pieces of various sizes also. Finally I really like the addition of loops that go in the fold of your ear to help keep the earbuds in. I have a lot of problems with earbuds falling out and this feature is helping quite a lot with that issue.
2,Sound quality is very good but they constantly fall out of my ear and their overly complicated touch controls mean that while I’m try to fit them back into my ears I’m unintentionally changing all the settings adjusting volume going in between ambient and noise cancelling modes skipping ahead going back etc. really disappointed.
1,So this is my third set of Indy fuel earbuds that have had the same problem. I keep returning them under warranty.  The left earbud never seems to charge consistently as you can see in the picture. If I press down on it it will start working but even with the case closed the contact is inconsistent enough that it often doesn't charge or even worse randomly pairs to my phone from my briefcase making it impossible to quickly pick up a phone call.
1,do not buy these headphones.  i have the audio turned up to 11 and you can barely hear them. can not get any support from Skullcandy.  waste of 80 bucks
5,Great pair of earbuds plus it has the “tile” app Capability so if you miss placed them it will help you find them.
1,I got my buds at Costco. I was hoping for  a good alternative to my old LG buds. These were very unreliable. They cut out constantly. I'd take them on a walk and one side would stop working. To repair you had to have the case. I'm not sure what version of Blutooth they were using but simply placing the phone in my pocket would cause the headphones to cut out.
2,I tried 2 sets of these and in both cases the high/mid was way too sharp. I tried adjusting the EQ to compensate but to no avail. The other features were great and they are comfy...but that overactive driver made everything literally painful to listen to.
5,My husband just got these and he can’t hear a word I’m saying right in front of him. So I would say they work perfectly haha
5,after trying several headphones and returning them. i went with a cheaper option and bought the indy ANCheadphones and they are the best . no negatives with these they are the bomb.
5,I’ve had these for over 6 months. You can swap to and from ambient mode. They hold great in the ear. Keeps a great charge. Main reason for the 5 star review is I had my first issue after letting my nephew borrow and both ear buds weren’t pairing. I called their tech support and had zero wait time and the guy walked me thru re-pairing them within 2 minutes. I use these more than my JLab and AirPods.
1,After going through 2 pairs of these I determined they are not worth the cost. Both sets when talking to someone go left to right and back and forth with a robot voice. When driving down the road no one can hear me on both sets this happened. Went through customer support they were no help. Checked all the settings in my phone nothing changed as all I did was pair them. Ultimately the $15 pair I bought after returning 2 sets of these work way better with absolutely no problems! I think they should work on their Bluetooth hardware.
1,Absolutely garbage. Owned the cheap version upgraded to these and every ten seconds there is four seconds of silence. Can’t even use them they are so bad. You are better off with the $20 set.
1,*DOESN’T WORK WITH IPHONE. IVE TRIED EVERYTHING DON’T BUY THESE. WASTE OF MONEY. ONLY WORKS WITH ONE EARBUD AT A TIME… AS U CAN TELL IM FURIOUS
1,Only one works at a time. They worked only the very first time I used them then wouldn't pair. I've spent hours trying to get them to resync looking up troubleshooting on the internet but they won't connect. I feel bad because I got these as a gift which was really thoughtful so how do I tell the person who bought them that they got ripped off? Now I see Skull Candy has been getting this feedback for awhile. Guess they don't care as long as they get your money.
5,I'm convinced that this page is either being review bombed or some of you are being sold counterfeit products by unscrupulous amazon sellers. The bass is deep the sound quality is great for earbuds under $100 they fit my ears like a glove the touch controls are responsive and using one earbud or both is as simple as taking only one from the case.Skullcandy really suprised me with this one. I never expextrd such a high quality product from them especially as their normal earbud/headphone sound quality is average at best.
1,I bought this from a big warehouse store because they were discounted and I now need Bluetooth headphones since I upgraded my phone. The battery drains fast at random they lose connection to my phone easily the touch control on the earpiece will restart my song from the beginning when I just try to adjust it for comfort. I will replace this soon
5,These are pretty decent overall. I really like the feel and comfort on these and they were easy to use straight out of the box.The quality is good with no seemingly loose connections or other issues. The sound is nice if it a bit tinny at times though the noise cancellation isn't spectacular; I could hear some street noises outside my apartment over these.All in all not bad and a nice budget option.
5,Great earbuds I absolutely love them. Sound quality is excellent the volume is very loud. Easy to charge and the magnetic case works well. I can easily turn up the volume or take a phone call while they are in my ear. I highly recommend this product.
1,Worked okay for a while though it will only pair with one device at a time which was disappointing.Now after a couple of weeks only one ear will pair at a time. They will not play simultaneously.Absolutely do not buy.
1,This device is wracked with annoying connectivity issues which is very annoying for a purchase that made in January 2021 and had to send back via warranty in April due to a defect in the left earbud. The replacement earbuds still have the left bud connectivity issue which will go back to the company upon any further annoyance.
1,These are total trash. They will not stay connected. DO NOT BUY!!! If you want to workout with these at all do not buy. I am real person who spent real money at Costco for these. I want people to know they will not work during a workout. Even if you are not sweating. They do not stay paired!!  You have been warned. I wish someone told me.
1,Bluetooth connection is terrible can never get both to play music at same time even after following all reset videos. I bought this for 50$ at Costco. Complete waste of my money and time spent troubleshooting the Bluetooth to my iPhone
1,After 2 months of use the charging contact is corroded and won't charge well without scraping it off with a pin. Contacted support and while the packaging and skullcandy website promise a "Fearless use Promise" warranty they absolutely refuse to honor it. Should be reported to BBB. Criminal.
1,Not worth the price. Broke after less than a month of being used. They dont stay in my ears and are constantly uncomfortable. The noise cancellation thing is a lie all of the different noise modes sound exactly the same. Way too expensive for a crappy product.
1,The design is solid. The sound is very good. Unfortunately they don’t work much of the time. They have serious Bluetooth issues often not connecting at all or sound garbled. The worst I’ve ever experienced. The cheapest set of ear buds I’ve ever owned are far better. These are junk. Buy something else. Yes I’ve followed all instructions multiple times.
1,Terrible wireless headphones the sound quality was decent for about a day and then the bluetooth connectivity decided to just stop and I can't pair them to any devices now. Don't waste your money just get airpods
1,The earbuds are great but the case is trash .it stops working pretty quick
1,Bought them last note charged overbite connected to my phone this morning quite awkward controls but sounded good on calls 3pm  left earbud said low battery then turned off put back in charger lite comes on then goes off  not charging left earbud. Returned very disappointed!(I bought this set at Costco)
5,These head phones are great! Each can be used individually.  If I plan on wearing them all day I rotate charging one and wearing one. I have worn them 12 + hours at a time and rotating them out has been a wonderful solution for me. They mold well to my ears despite one ear opening being smaller than the other. They don't slip or fall out even with frequent movement. The sound quality is great and they really do block out external noise.
1,Wish I had read these reviews before I shelled out the money for these I thought Skullcandy was a good product I'll know better next time.
5,Exelente producto
5,I was initially considering purchasing Apple Airpods but then I came across these (as I was looking for something simple that played music for my runs and for holding calls). I REALLY enjoyed these earbuds! These are a great lower cost alternative (especially if you can purchase them at a Costco).
1,They sound great but they construct out so don’t buy these.
1,They won’t pair at the same time sometimes the right one pair but not the left and sometimes the other way around
1,These are terrible. I have a $15 Bluetooth headphone that sounds 10x better than this. There are laughably bad. No bass difficult to control and to top it off they don’t even fit cleanly in the charging case!
5,I cannot believe how (1) quickly they connect to my phone (if you phone is ringing  pop these out put them in and there's still plenty of time to answer) (2) the sound quality kicks my old blue tooths butt! (3) The life and quick battery charge.They take a minute to get used to the feel but after you do they are easy to pop in.
5,Sound quality is great.  I think they are very comfortable and I liked the price.  The case I nice too.  I hope I can keep up with these.
1,Audio kept on breaking or alternating between left and right. Basically the sound is not continuous and kept stuttering. Works better on mobile phones but barely.
1,Pairing impaired these buds will disappoint most people. Also can't stand the stem style design which feels very awkward to me. Didn't know that until trying this pair out.
1,Don't trust Skullcandy. They lie to you. Battery life is not whatever they tell you. Deceptive advertising. Disgusting.
5,got this for myself and have already bought a bunch for Christmas gifts!
5,Fantastic earbuds. Sound quality is perfect touch controls take some getting used too.  Pairing was instant.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I've had a multitude of different manufacture and styles of earbuds. I've had Beats JBL Contours and Jabra 85t - in addition to Skull Candy Indy Fuel. Of all the brands styles there isn't another brand that offers the same standard features as Skull Candy. From the battery useful life to the wireless case the packed sound to the self created noise canceling none offer even close.The top feature the Indy Fuel has is the two piece ear piece design that creates the noise canceling effect. Because of this the sound is 'booming' and the ear piece packs a lot of punch.  You'll be hard pressed to find a better product for the price point. This is one of my highest recommendations of an electronic device.
4,I'm semi disappointed in these. I had some pretty high expectations when I decided I would purchase them. Thr sound is "ok" not the worst but definitely not the best either. Touch controls are also kind of annoying I find myself accidentally touching them whenever I go to readjust the earbuds. My biggest disappointment in these really is the bass quality these just don't have the right amount for music.
5,These are incredible earbuds. Absolutely insane bass and aound quality. So many insane features on the app. Great ear feel. And amazing quality and construction. If your looking for earbuds these are the ones!
5,They're comfortable and good sound we don't know about battery life yet real easy to set up and they're kind of stylish amazing sound for small size thank you
1,Do not buy these! One of the buds will not charge eventually. Bought a pair brand new. One side went out. Will not charge. Sent them in for warranty. They sent back a brand new pair. One month later same thing happens. One bud goes out. Will not charge. Odds of that happening twice. Within 3 months with two completely brand new buds....  ? I wish I would have never bought these.
5,The sound quality is excellent. The bud is very comfortable in the ear. For someone who uses hearing aids the product is great for "noise cancellation". I love them!
5,These are actually quite nice. I was very surprised by the quality without having to pay an arm and a leg so I do suggest buying these if you’re looking for something that is decent quality without breaking the bank.
5,Noise cancelation works amazingly to where I can hear my music perfectly fine at the lowest volume with my tv playing at normal level across the room.
2,They fall out easier then the cheapo you can get at dollar storeThey do have good noise cancelling BUT I would highly suggest not wearing both while driving or bike riding as you will not hear things like sirens or a vehicle getting to close while bike riding.I left them in the package and forgot to get them to the return location.oh and they have quite a few blips while listening and all the fancy stuff they are supposed to be able to do via an app ..what a joke froze up and I ended up having to uninstall the app so never have been able to make use of the so called extra features.
3,I was very excited to recieve these. I need good earphones for my work and I've yet to find some I like. The reviews were great so I decided to give these a shot. The first few weeks were great but about two weeks ago I started getting static in my left earbud. It was very loud and noticeable. I followed the trouble shooting options many times as well with other devices and the static persisted making it hard to hear anything else. I contacted the company and they only repeated these same troubleshooting options and not much other help so decided to return them. The search for good earphones continues.
5,Todo bien por ahora
5,Thank You  very nice
5,These are excellent buds for the price. If they were a Galactic or iBrand; they'd probably cost twice as much.
1,Muy bonitos. Buen sonido pero de muy poca vida útil y sin reparación
5,They are pretty good for the discounted price i got them
5,I purchased these because my Apple AirPods were losing battery quickly after a full charge and one AirPod lost all sound. I did not want to pay full price for the new Air Pods Pro so I was looking for something comparable but with a lower price. I 100% recommend these earbuds. They are perfect for airplanes because of the noise cancelling technology. The sound is just amazing! The standard size attachments were too large for my ears but they came with multiple replacement sizes and I was able to find a fit that was perfect for my ears. The Tile technology is also really cool as you can track down each individual earbud and the tile app will let you know if you’re getting “hot” or “cold” as you’re searching for each earbud - and of course the earbuds will chirp to help you find them. Even if you’re not in the market for noise cancelling earbuds I’d still purchase these ANC Earbuds over even the most standard Apple AirPods which I believe are the same price. I’ve never used Apple Airpods Pro but I can only imagine these are very similar…and for $100 these are totally worth it.
5,I am picky on sound and I have small ears. The sound quality is great they fit well are comfortable and stay in place. I did the "hearing test" to set my personal sound and I have heard parts of songs that I never heard before. Great balance of high mid and low tones. Bass can be turned off in podcast mode if you listen to books on tape or a podcast. I tried this mode out while watching a tv show and the voices sounded good. It automatically resets to music mode when you put them in the case. The bluetooth range is good. I can leave my phone in one room and go anywhere in my house and garage.Only complaints that are very minor are I do not like the voice that tells what listening mode you are in. With the accent I can not tell if she is saying noise cancelling on or off. The directions for the tap functions are not all correct. Example: tap once and then hold for 2 sec on the right bud to skip to next song is actually just hold on the right bud for 2 secs.
5,Hands down the best earbuds I’ve ever had. Bought others that didn’t fit as well and the sound quality is fantastic.
5,Long lasting and good quality
5,Has good bass stays in ear.
2,Been through 4 pairs this year already. When this 5th pair gives up and one of the headphones either starts cutting out stops charging or wont respond to it's touch pad like the other pairs I've had I'll have to find a new product. I wear them 50 hours a week so mine might be an extreme use case.
5,I like that the bass comes through so deep without distortion and the highs are very crispy as well. Very good sound quality. Have to push into my ears some times because they might fall out is my only complaint.
5,Son los audífonos ideales buen sonido carga inalambrica y la batería dura bastante el único inconveniente que tuve fue que no pude conectarlos a la App de Tile que viene integrada.
5,I love skull candy headphones and ear buds.  These are great when I work out or want to just zone to music.
5,I love skull candy headphones and ear buds.  These are great when I work out or want to just zone to music.
5,Outside of the noise cancelling being a bit lacking the overall experience with these earphones has been very good! They're easy to set up have good audio quality and after a bit of learning the controls are very simple and straightforward! The little support fin on top of each earphone also doesn't feel uncomfortable at all and you're likely to forget it's even there after a bit!
5,This is my second pair -- one for the office and one for home.  They are easy to set up and work very well.
5,These are a truly great set of ear buds.  They fit comfortably in your ear(s) and the battery life is great.  Plus if you are busy and need to charge them on the run the case recharges multiple times before having to charge it.  With multiple ear piece sizes in the box you are bound to find your perfect fit.  The sound quality is phenomenal.  Another fantastic Skullcandy product.Update:  I liked these so well I bought a set for my husband who drives a semi.  This is honestly the 1st set of ear buds we've found that he can wear in his semi and I still get this great sound quality!
2,I bought these and they worked really good  until today I got my earbuds and the left one didn't turn on I dont know what happened they worked fine last week they should be charged but I put then back to charged to see if maybe that was the problem nope  not the problem so is anyone is having this problem
2,There are quite literally only 3 qualities to these earbuds in comparison to everything within its tier and above: Sound quality ANC and the way they fit within the ear are all great. However it's extremely easy to place these within the case and not notice that they are not charging. The battery life is lacking compared to many others. Pairing isn't explained in the instructions and it took me someone who has used 6 other brands and 14 other kinds of wireless earbuds longer than it should have to connect to PC specifically. While these are okay overall I was extremely disappointed with SkullCandy on this one. They usually release at MINIMUM a 4 star.I have come back to this review about a month later with another issue to add on. Even though my earbuds have been paired for a while there are so many times I can distinctly recall them blatantly NOT connecting to said devices. This is the biggest flaw for something that claims to have 5.0 Bluetooth but connects worse than a faulty Wii Remote.
3,I have always liked skull candy however this is the first time that I am not satisficed with the product.  The ear buds did not come with a frim ear adapters in size so as not to fall out of my ears.  Mind you I have medium ears and the largest adapters still fell out.  All I have to do is shake my head slightly and they fall out.  The carrier top cover seems flimsy and does not snap shut.  So what I found out is that the adapters were not long enough to secure the buds in the ear.  I applied another brand ear adapter to the buds so that they will stay in.  I have also recently noticed I am getting cracks in the sound and skips.
5,These are the best skull candy ear buds I’ve ever owned. The sound quality is amazing the battery life is wonderful. You can adjust most of the settings in the new app. Wonderful headphones!
5,So my friend has an older pair of skullcandy wireless without the wireless charging and his is true black these are more like a Grey than a black in comparison. Kinda really upset as I hate Grey and love black since it's my favorite color but I didn't wanna get his since it has a Grey line on his but I wanted these but after having them in my hand it's a dark Grey obviously Grey too not even black my black shirt is darker than this. It charges fast asf tho it had zero power when arrived after 30minutes its already at 75% so that's hecka fast. The fact it has wireless charging gives you more options to charge the device. Active noise cancelation would be for if I have to travel or be in the car and I can't hear anything due to a loud background noise or as a Bluetooth headset for the car plus I hate white so airpods never gonna happen. These seem to fit the bill just next time make a better blacker blackest color and hope it has like uwb tile tracking for the case and regular tile tracking for the earbuds and Bluetooth 5.2 cause I think the tile tracking feature is cool but if you can only track the earbud for about 4 to 8 hours it's not the best the case for 30 hours sounds like a big bet since I'd probably lose the case cause it fell out of my pocket. The only other feature I would add is stronger magnets for the lid so it doesn't easily flop open. And then you guys need to design a case made out of rubber with a skull on it so we don't lose the astetic of the earbuds cause I would hate to drop this and it break. The only other thing I could ask for to be added is fast wireless charging cause 15w wireless charging exists. I will update review on battery life when throughly tested.
5,I bought these for my husband last year and he loved them.  But he accidentally washed them.  But he loves them so much we bought another pair.
5,The base is amazingnoise cancelation is awesomefor 80 bucksyou can't go wrongI'm truly amazed with these thingshighly recommend it.
5,Noise cancellation not good
4,There are a lot of things I really like about these! They do not fall out every 15 minutes. Battery life is awesome. Super easy to pair independently. Charge quickly. They have lots of tap functions. The only issue I have is how touchy those tap functions are. To pause/play/answer calls you need to tap twice. That's a great idea because one tap calling is a mess. However the two taps are tricky to get right so pausing/playing/answering isn't as efficient as it could be.
2,The big grips were hurting and the smaller ones did not fit and they kept falling out.  There was not a mid size fit.  So we had to return.
2,The sound is really good. The app is cool and lets you set up personal sound. I am very disappointed in the noise cancelling. I have the noise cancelling on. Verified by the earbud voice and the app. I have my TV up loud and it’s no different than with the noise cancelling off. My son’s AirPod pros work a lot better; of course they’re twice as much as these. I put those on and I can’t hear a thing. With the noise cancelling turned on with the Skullcandy there’s a staticky sound. The Skullcandy’s are comfortable and secure in the ear. Somewhat disappointed but I’ll keep them.
1,Bought my first pair and one side had no power what so ever so I returned the item. Bought another pair same product and one side kept connecting and disconnecting awful product so I returned again only to purchase a different brand. Only if I could give half a star I would.
5,The sound quality is amazing i love the bass it has and how you can adjust it on the app the way you like. I 100% these are better than the basic airpods. The noise cancellation doesnt block out everything but i wasn’t looking for that. It definitely blocks out 60% of the sound around you. The price is a little bit higher than i like but they are worth it.
4,So these headphones sound fantastic and the noise canceling tech is great. They are twice as loud as my old buds and have eq directions connectivity and more in the Skull Candy app. The case feels durable and high quality and so do the earbuds. Overall love them.Cons: the charging case is not flat on the bottom and cannot sit upright.All in all great.
4,First pair came defective out of the box. Right ear bud did not turn on. Second pair were perfect. Amazon Customer Service was great.
3,The sound quality and noise canceling were great but the app wouldn’t work at all. I am using an iPod 7th gen with newest iOS software. If I could have help that would be great
1,Biggest waste of money. There was a time when Skullcandy was a good product not any more. Making and taking calls I’m muffled and even screaming the other person can barely hear me. Don’t know why they suck. I’ll be sure to find a new company to buy from only owned them for a month. Tried all troubleshooting to get them to work. People don’t waste your money support a company with working quality earbuds I’ve owned about a dozen of there products never had a issue until this one.
5,To new unsure of battery life.
5,I purchased a pair for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them! I'm not really into ear buds but these sound AMAZING. I actually want a pair for myself!
1,I have replaced my headphones 3 times for charging issues. Atleast one Bud never charges and they've never fallen.  But when they work it sounds great.
5,These are great for listening to music.  Good solid bass and nice highs (as long as positioned correctly in your ears).  For phone calls it seems the Noise Cancelling is only for you the listener not those you are calling so Noise Cancelling doesn't seem to apply to your mic.
5,Grandson loves them. Price was right and fast shipping made them a great Christmas gift.
5,Everything good the sound quality works but it could use some work after that every great the sound quality great and the distance I can be from my phone and head phones is actually good
4,The only knock I have is that periodically you have to adjust the ear tips. These are great buds
1,Wow.  A friend recommended these to me and boy he picked a winner.  Noise cancellation is amazing.  I work out at a pretty loud gym and it shuts out everything but my tunes.  Sound quality is also amazing.  I am a musician and I am hearing things I never heard before in my music.  Love the app.  I recommend these very highly.I am going to have to add to my previous rave review that they lasted five months and died.  They are under warranty and I get to pay for shipping to send a defective product back.  I am not pleased.  Oh no not at all.  Do not buy Skullcandy products unless you are prepared to roll the dice and probably lose.The saga continues... the replacements developed terrible static in the left ear and are going back yet again.  At least this time Skullcandy is providing the shipping.  This is a perfectly horrible product.  Buy a pair and give them to someone you don't like.Finally after over a month and several e-mails they sent me a coupon for $130.00 to replace the most recent defective pair.  We have a definite pattern here and they WILL NOT give your money back.  Skullcandy has great marketing because the product and service is terrible.I wish you could give a product a negative number but one is as low as you can go.
5,I purchased these for MS teams for work and they work great. I am always told sound quality is good.
4,The sound is excellent but they will not stay in my husband's ears.  We can not find any ear hooks that will fit.  SO they are basically useless to him.
4,Good quality
5,Excelente producto no tengo ninguna queja funcionan perfecto se quedan en su lugar sin importar que hagas movimientos bruscos.Los controles son un poco confusos al principio pero te acostumbras muy rápido.La app de skullcandy le farma mucho desarrollo actualmente solo sirve para registrar tus productos.En cuanto al sonido el modo Movies es el mejor se escuchan muy claros los instrumentos los audifonos tienen una cancelación de ruido de forma pasiva muy bueno y son muy cómodos para larga sesiones de música.
5,Aunque es obvio no son airpods y se nota; esto es por si alguien pensaba como alternativos a ellos. Suenan muy bien y son muy cómodos responden fácil a los comandos con los dedos. El material no es lo mejor se sienten muy plasticosos pero pasan. No me preocupa que no sean ANC porque aíslan super bien ruidos externos y no vale la pena el sobreprecio de ANC. El Ambient mood no es espectacular pero sirve sin música se oye un gis leve.La sincronización inicial fue complicada pero al final si lo hizo bien con mi iMac y con el iPhone pero para cambiar entre ellos tengo que desenlazarlos del equipo actual para enlazarlos al otro.Los volvería a comprar? Sin duda pero si tuviera mucha lana compraría los Airpods pro.
4,■感想全体的な音質についてはイコライザで調整もできるし、専用のアプリで使用者の聴力に合わせて調整も可能なので特に問題を感じません。最初は最低音量が大きく感じましたが、イコライザで全体のレベルを下げたので問題なし。着用感は個人の耳の形によるのでなんとも言えませんが、個人的には問題ありません。落下等は気になりません。インイヤーなので、長時間つけたら違和感出るのは仕方なし。軽いので、装着していての重さを感じることはありません。ノイズ除去についてシャットアウトまではいきませんが、電車の走行音は音はかなり小さくなります。仕事中、隣の席の人物の電話の会話音量が気になり集中力を欠いてしまう事があったので、ノイズキャンセルのみオンで使用しましたが雑音や喋り声をかなり抑えることができ集中して仕事する事ができました。欠点①たまに左右での音ズレや片方のみ音が聞こえなくなる減少が起こりますが、電源のオンオフで解消しました。②たまに聞こえる音がザー（ジー）っという雑音になります。これだけは毎回ビックリしますが、しばらくすると直るか、ボリューム0にしてからの復活もしくは電源の切入で回復するので個人的には問題ないです。※それが許せない人は無線ではなく有線がいいです。③形状的にケースのフタに引っかかりやすいですが、フタの閉じ方を工夫すれば問題なし。レビュー内に個人の問題を製品の欠陥のように謳っている人がいましたが、脂による影響は個人の問題なので製品の欠陥じゃないですよ。
5,I wanted earbuds for my walks and my husband recommended these ones as they sound great sit in the ear well and has options of noise canceling and ambient sound.They were easy to pair and feel great in my ear without movement. Overall I am satisfied and enjoy the simplicity of them.
4,Están excelentes pero tienen sus detallitos. Es un poco tedioso vincularlos la primera vez; hay ocasiones en que los micrófonos del ANC hacen interferencia y suena medio raro por unos segundos. El ANC no es definitivo todavía hay cierto nivel de ruido externo pero se nota muchísimo la diferencia
1,This is my second pair of these earbuds. Got a replacement for the original ones. They disconnect from my phone regularly even when in use. I end up having to unpair and repair them for them to reconnect. The sound has gone on the first set and the replacement. I'm left with only being able to hear from just one bud. Truly disappointed.
4,I got these on sale and they were a great deal. The ambient mode works for me in construction between needing hearing protection and the ability to pick up when people are talking to me.Sound quality is pretty good for wireless and they have their own volume controls so they can get pretty loud. My only complaint is that the touch controls are limited when using one single bud. For example using only the left bud will still skip backward only and turn volume down only. Hoping an app update could maybe change this in the future
5,These things are sick! Bass junkie here and the bass is proper...the connectivity is good I dunno what everyones problem is pull them out hit pair on your phone put them back in and pull out only the right bud pair it again...done now either will work single or both whatever. Comfortable fast charging easy to use lots of controls on the buds themselves and it's great having the assistant available! Got em @ $80...it's a steal all day long...get em..now
5,Excelentes audífonos tienen carga wireless en el case (aunque no traen su base cargadora) funcionan en par o en modo SOLO. Se oyen perfecto y lucen muy bien
4,Fit hurts my ears but only because I’m scared to take off the ear tips as they’re hard to put back on but I’ve had skullcandy before and they fit my ears amazingly. I’m not a buff for audio so I can’t comment but the case and earbuds look awesome much better than the originals.
5,La verdad son un producto que me ah encantado para hacer ejersicio son ideales el sonido me encanta el plus de la tecnologia TILE es espectacular en mi opinion un gran producto calidad precio
5,Superaron mis expectativas se escuchan increíble y son bonitos súper recomendados llegaron antes de lo esperado
5,Los audífonos son muy bueno se sienten de buena calidad toda la construcción tanto de su estuche de carga como los mismos audífonos y el audio para el precio que tienen es excelente.
5,I really like them and they work very well. The don’t have too much range past 40 ft but otherwise they’re great.
2,The sound and fit was good.But:They don't pair easily/properly.The tap controls don't work.Can only use the right earbud by itself.Takes a week to get any support from Skull Candy.Had to return them.
3,It's solid but i noticed that once i had 2 phones paired with it started randomly disconnecting and reconnecting. To be honest you could probably find better earbuds for cheaper
4,Let's get the good stuff out first.They fit well hold in place well are light sound great hold a charge for 3 hours of play time and people could hear me clearly through the built-in mics. I love the wireless charging feature and they charge quickly in the case.However my use case was as bluetooth earbuds for conference calls on my laptop. And they simply don't work for this scenario. The problem boils down to bluetooth connectivity.OH MY WORD are they difficult to set up! I actually work in electronics design and live with bleeding edge technology day in day out but setting these earbuds to work with my laptop was insane. However once I got through the process of resetting the earbuds 18 times going through connectivity operations even more and then sacrificing a USB mouse on the alter of multi-media I eventually managed to get it to work mostly.I still occasionally had issues where conversations would take turns as to which earbud would receive signal. Sometimes the left sometimes the right and sometimes both. But for my use case I couldn't leave the earbuds connected to the laptop waiting for a call because after a few hours they would loose charge. I also couldn't leave them charged since re-pairing takes more than 1 full minute.The last part is really not the manufacturers fault but rather me trying to push them to be something they weren't.In the end I gave them to my daughter so she can listen to music from her cell phone while studying. A much better use case.
5,Absolutely love these headphones.  Battery life is long lasting.  Haven't had any issues so far.
5,Excelente
4,I like everything about them but the fitting took a little more time than expected to get used to them
5,for iPhone
5,Bastante buenos por el precioEl sonido está bastante bien👍Recomendados 100%
4,great sound nothing bad to say
5,Love these Headphones!!!!!
4,These sound great even better with the custom sound profiling in the app the battery is good the case is okay the fit is really good in my ears and i barely notice im wearing them.However they like to stop playing on their own in one ear sonetimes if you have ANC on they sometimes have a fit of playing loud static which only goes away when you stop playing sound and when I turn both buds on sometimes they only play through one ear.Nothing truly horrible but issues i wish didnt come with the price.
4,Connection between buds is Skippy at times but I returned because the way it hooks to the ear is very firmbut if that O shaped tab was more like an L shaped like some other brands it would be more comfortable.But the sound is amazing and the external mode is really convenient
3,If you select the "AMBIENT" setting and there's any wind blowing or any OTHER noise..... it sounds like noise inside a tin can. I don't like the ambient setting.After just 3 weeks the left bud stopped working. Would not reset would not connect neither automatically or manually!Sound is good.Bought a set for my granddaughter for Christmas and so far she likes them but I still don't care for the noise cancelling setting. Can't use them for phone calls because the noise cancelling is such that you can't hear yourself talk and our ears aren't designed for that.I would much rather see them with an option of turning the N/C off and having clear ambient sound from outside  and being able to hear yourself and people talk clearly without having to remove them.There has to be a way without that tinny microphone sound!
3,The case feels SUPER cheap might not be cheaply made but it feels like cheap dollar store plastic.I couldn’t get them to pair to each other I could only get one to connect to my phone at a time. I tried close to 30 times to get them to connect to each other but they just wouldn’t connect.The left earbud had a very strong connection to the case popped in smooth and charged immediately. The right one didn’t connect unless you tapped it down never sat low enough to charge and gave me issues from the start.Controls were difficult to use took longer than stated times for the controls to work. Had to tap very hard to register and it was uncomfortable in my ear drum to tap that hard and push the headphone that far in.It may be nitpicking but the quality of the rubber ear pieces is much worse than the Ink’d headphones I used to use 10 years ago. They were very thin in comparison and unnecessarily difficult to change sizes. I still use the pieces from my Ink’d headphones from 10 years ago and they still fit my ears better than any others I use the rubber was thicker and provided a much better seal and more passive noise reduction.I can’t comment on the quality of the wireless charging because I don’t have a charging pad.Overall quality control needs to be improved. The cheap feel of the plastic is a turn off almost immediately and the connection issues and difficulty of the controls were too much to work past. I will be returning them.
4,These ear buds are great if you want to drown out the sorrows of everyday life. The main concern with most wireless earbuds is if they will stay in your ears whilst you're engaging in certain tasks like jogging biking etc. Well I can say that I fell off of a long board and broke my leg and I still heard safe and sound by capital cities playing in my ears so big ups to the design team cause I know that while I was in the middle of the street trying to figure out what to do I was sure impressed that my earbuds never flung out of my ears during the tumble. Other than that sound quality is good I used the equalizer on Spotify and pushed the bass really heavy so it feels really good noise cancelling wise. You can turn your music all the way up and no one around you can hear it so all in all I'd say these are a great choice for wireless earbuds
2,The sound on these is really good however I hate the touch controls. They're weird and unreliable. Also I hate that it's the standard "left for volume down and previous track / right for volume up and next track" as I often only wear the left one. I'll continue to look for better earbuds but these are okay.Update: lowered the rating even more because the right bud can't be used alone
3,The headphones worked great until one of them just stopped working(3.5months). Disappointed in skullcandy though as to go through the warranty you need to pay to ship the headphones back to them. Which is ridiculous as these are under warranty. Now I need to wait to see if they will warranty the earbuds
4,Tienen gran sonido y son cómodos; pero no son lo mejor para llamadas
1,Well my review states one star because when I received my earbuds they they were already activated (and can not be deactivated) on another TILE account which means these were used to be tracked and not New as stated in product description. As for earbuds they are of great quality and sound is awesome and battery has been holding good as mentioned in description.
1,I bought a pair for my sister for her birthday and a pair for myself.She has messaged me everyday since she got them with bluetooth issues.I barely used them once.Issues with disconnecting and charging.Currently waiting for skullcandy to repair issues.For the time I did use them they did sound ok. Nothing to really write home about.In conclusion I am not happy with my purchases.
2,Tengo problemas con el audífono izquierdo los compre en septiembre 2021 cómo puedo hacer válida la garantía en México?
1,Pues el producto iba bien la carga es buena. El sonido realmente le falta pero para quien no le guste que te reviente la oreja pues va bien. No es tan cómodo después de un tiempo te cansa y te duele la oreja le tuve que quitar las partes que lleva por arriba porque no era tan ergonómico. Y bueno después de 2 meses que lo compre no logro vincular los audífonos para que suenen ambos o se vincula uno y el otro no suena o viseversa pero no ambos al mismo tiempo.**EDIT**Ya logre solucionar el problema de vinculación se tienen que reiniciar los auriculares para poder volver a emparejar.Y a la fecha de hoy marzo de 2022 puedo decir que no compren este producto es decepcionante tanto que estoy usando mejor unos auriculares de cable que tenía hace bastantes años yo creo desde 2017 y se escuchan mucho mejor tanto en calidad como en potencia. Si valieran los audífonos 500 pues puede ser buena compra pero para lo que yo los compre no vale la pena
5,I’m loving these Skullcandy Indy Fuel True Wireless Earbuds... they’re easy to use and the sound quality is pretty good.The earbuds look great in and out of the case I really like the design. I love the charging case they come in as it’s perfect for storage and it makes charging these earbuds very easy. I do wish the charging case would stand up on its own it instantly falls down when trying to stand it up. The earbuds arrived with enough charge to listen straight away which was cool and it came with extra earbud shapes and sizes. I prefer the size that they originally came with they fit in my ear perfectly and they stay comfortable even after long use.The sound quality is good for me with bass that hits hard and vocals that are clear to hear. I don’t like music too loud in my ears and this is perfect for me at only half the volume. All of the touch controls are very easy to use and the instruction booklet that comes with them is simple to follow with all of the tips you need. The Bluetooth works flawlessly for me on my iPhone with easy pairing and disconnecting issues.Overall I’m super happy with these skullcandy earbuds and I’m hoping they’ll last a while.
1,I expected better for its price
3,This is my third set of “true wireless” earbuds that I’ve tried and the first one that actually includes wireless charging. Like the other true wireless buds that I’ve used (this one is in the middle in terms of price) I find they do not sound as good as wired earbuds. The difference between wired and wireless is quite noticeable and I do not even consider myself an audiophile.Overall I think these buds are pretty good (because of the convenience of wireless) but they have some issues that prevent me from saying they’re great. At their price point I expect a more stable bluetooth connection and on my P20 Pro I get stutters at only 10-15 feet away and occasional momentary dropouts up close during playback.The touch commands are pretty comprehensive but it can be a pain remembering what they all are.I like that these buds have the option of using a fin on the earbuds which for me improves the fit and helps them stay in my ears.I have mixed feeling about these earbuds because of the occasional dropouts when they are in close range to my phone. I would put it this way - these buds are fine for people aren’t looking to be totally immersed in their music. So for commuting or the office they’re probably fine. For serious listening sessions you’re better off with something that can maintain a rock solid connection. Having said that I have to wonder why people who want serious listening sessions would opt to do it with wireless earbuds since you can do so much better from a sound quality perspective if you use something wired at the same price.All in all I give these earbuds a 3.5 (rounded down to a 3 since only whole stars are allowed). For their price I expected better.The Good Parts- Sound quality out of the box is pretty good in the Music EQ mode. You can probably improve it further if you have a music player on your phone with an equalizer. Having said that I have yet to use a pair of wireless buds that sound as good as a good pair of wired buds at the same price.- Bass is OK but I would not say they are super bassy. I have a pair of Sony wireless buds that are way bassier than these. I find bass preferences to be subjective and personal so your mileage will vary.- Has two sets of fins small and large that can help with fitting the buds in the ear. You can also choose not to use them.- Wireless charging of the case is very handy. I tried it with a couple of wireless chargers and they worked well. Wired charging however is faster than wireless charging.- The touch commands are generally sensible and work well.- You can use either bud by itself- I had no issues pairing these buds with a Huawei P20 ProHit or Miss- Audio quality depends heavily on the seal you can make so I strongly recommend you try all three tip sizes. When I switched from Medium to Small I found the sound improved noticeably.- The range is just OK. I started experiencing stutters at around 10 feet. The connection strength isn’t as strong as other earbuds I’ve tested including much less expensive ones. I experienced occasional momentary dropouts while listening to music that I couldn’t attribute to a notification/alert on my phone.- As someone who is no longer young I find remembering all the touch commands a little daunting. Fortunately the key commands are fairly easy to remember… unless you have multiple sets of earbuds you use that all have slightly different tap commands.- I did not find that the Ambient mode helped me hear my surroundings that much better when music was playing.- The fins if not attached properly to the buds can prevent the case from closing properly.- Has a Tile “finder” feature. I generally don’t like installing an app and signing up to a service for this kind of feature so I did not test it. Having said that my experience with Tile type “finder” products has not been good.- I find I accidentally trigger the touch commands on the buds as I have the bad habit of touching the buds while listening to music.- It would have been nice if it had active noise cancellation but that might be asking for a lot at its price point.Not so good- I accidentally covered the microphone on the right bud in Ambient mode with my finger while adjusting the buds and I was greeted with a deafening screeching sound. The screeching did not occur when the same thing happened on the left bud which I found strange.
4,These are the first pair of Bluetooth earphones I have which have a built-in Tile tracking ability which is pretty cool if you often find yourself misplacing them. I like the idea but in reality you will have to hope that you lost the earbuds in a quiet room as the ‘find-me’ alert tone is issued through the earbuds themselves. It’s nowhere near as easy to hear compared to a Tile tag on your keychain or from your smartphone.I really love that the charging case can be charged via USC-C (instead of MicroUSB) or you can use a wireless charging pad! I’m happy that more things are adapting this tech as it’s super convenient.The charging time is short and the battery life for the earbuds is pretty good. They don’t stand out to me one way or the other in terms of being really long-lasting or dying too quickly. Cheaper earbuds generally only last 4 hours or less depending on how high you have the volume. These are much better offering around 6 hours of battery life (depending on volume level).Now that I’ve tried the different styles and designs of Bluetooth earphones I find that I prefer the stemmed earbud design (like Apple AirPods) vs little earbuds which are hard to put in take out or adjust easily without dropping them. I also prefer physical touch button controls over touch-sensitive controls so in this way I don’t like these as much compared to the Anker Soundcore earphones.On to the sound quality - bass lovers will be happy with these! No distortion or muddiness when playing bass-heavy songs even at higher volumes. Overall sound quality is good in my non-audiophile opinion. I listen to a variety of music genres and also podcasts and audiobooks.I use my Bluetooth earphonesfor making calls constantly whether I’m at home on a walk or driving (since they’re hands-free) but the constant struggle is to find a pair that offers good audio call quality for both myself and the person on the other end. The main complaint I hear from others when using these Indy Fuel earbuds is that my voice can sound very drowned out by background noise. The microphone does not isolate my voice very well. This is one of the main reasons why the Indy Fuel earphones are not my go-to set for every-day use.PROS+ Looks good comfortable fit - stem design similar to Apple AirPods (which I prefer over small earbuds)+ Mostly secure fit in ears+ Decent battery life (~6 hours)+ Rated IP55 (dust and sweat resistant)+ Convenient (for some) touch-sensitive control functions+ 4 LED battery indicator lights on charging case track remaining charge+ Charges via USB-C and wireless (yay!)+ Find your earbuds with Tile+ Ambient mode allows you to heard your surroundingsCONS- Not great for phone calls.- Touch-sensitive controls take a while to learn! A bit more complicated than the average BT earbuds- I prefer physical touch controls instead of touch-sensitive. Can be more finicky.
5,Pros:- Comfortable- Nice sound- Long battery life- Wireless charging- Easy to pair- Touch/tap controlsCons:- No cleaning toolI’ve never had or tried wireless earphones before. These Skull Candy Indy Fuel Earbuds are very comfortable and easy to learn/use. They come with 3 different sizes of rubber ear inserts. They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and you can leave them in your ear while you’re not using them and almost forget that you are wearing them. The sound quality is good when listening to music or on a phone call. When listening to music the bass quality/sound is very good. These buds also come with ambient mode. This allows me to hear what is going on around me without having to pull the earbuds out. The case charges the earbuds wirelessly.  I only really use them for phone calls while driving or walking around and I have only charged them once so far. They hold a charge of about 30 hours.  I have never had any issues with anyone not being able to hear me and I’ve been told that they are able to hear me very clearly.  You can also use only one earbud if need be. I had an ear infection and this feature gave me the opportunity to pair and use only one and the quality was great. The controls for these earphones are very easy to use once you read the manual and understand/learn the functions. The side of the ear piece are touch sensitive sensors that will react when you press/tap them. They are dust sweat and water resistant but I wish they came with some sort of tool to clean the crevices of the earbuds and the charging case. The rubber ear inserts are easy to remove and it takes a couple of tries to get them back on but once you do it they are easy to remove and replace.Overall these earbuds are amazing and worth giving them a try. They are comfortable have great sound quality amazing features and long battery life. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for high end great quality earbuds.
4,I'll start by saying I'm not an audiophile. While I've tested some truly high-end headphones and some cheap-as-chips models and I've found sound generally is a very personal preference. Some more expensive headphones have a richer sound but I grew up on non-Bluetooth headphones that cost less than ten dollars so you might say my tastes are less refined.When it comes to sound quality I actually really liked the Skullcandy Indy Fuel. I found the sound was very level (not too much bass) and since I prefer to hear vocals I felt they delivered that. If you prefer the music and bass to shine through you might not like it as much.The most important thing for me was connection and ease of use. I found Indy Fuel gave me no bother. Trying a lot of Bluetooth headphones the one thing I noticed time and time again is how annoying they are to use. Indy Fuel was simple. Pairing was easy and effortless they never dropped for me and they were always easy to use.The only negative is that I didn't love the case. I found it difficult to get the earbuds out at times you have to kind of pinch them. The colour could be more interesting too I've always thought of Skullcandy as that 'colourful cool' brand and these are an ugly grey.I dig the design of the headphones I have a preference for the 'strand' style of headphones that have a downwards stick. They come with various sizes of fins and buds. I took the fins off I have micro sized earholes and always find them uncomfortable. The good news for tiny-ear-holed people like me is the buds can sit comfortably at the smallest size.You can also listen with one ear at a time which is a must-have for households like ours where my partner and I interchange headphones and like to have only one ear listening and the other ear for listening for the sound of trouble! I do use both ears at night when crafting and listening to music and it sounds much better with both but the ability to use one is great.I also found the controls very easy to learn and after a day of using them I found it intuitive (there's always a learning process with BT headphones). They very seldom misread my taps compared to other headphones that I've used.Overall my experience with Indy Fuel was painless and dare I say pleasant! You definitely pay a bit more for the SkullCandy brand so if they were more stylish they'd be perfect for me but I still really liked them.
3,Using these earbuds has been a bit of an experience. When they work they are good. And I guess that is a good place to start. I did have some connection issues. I occasionally had them disconnect when trying to re-establish a connection to a device and also connection issues when initially pairing. The first is annoying but easy enough to get working with turning them off and on again. However the initial pairing issues were frustrating. I did try this on a couple of different Android phones as well as my Surface Pro 7 and my desktop computer. These things do not like to be connected to anything other than phones. I could get them to work... but it was a challenge. They also don't like to be paired with multiple devices at the same time. At their asking price I do expect more.The build quality is decent. They are comfortable. And the case includes USB-C charging (anything else has no place in 2020) as well as wireless charging. The case is nice and compact as well. Physically these are great. Once you manage to get them connected they sound about the same as anything else at this price. The treble is a bit harsh towards higher volumes there is too much bass and it sounds mushy but the mid-range is clear. But as I said this is the same with any wireless earbuds at this price. Battery life and latency are decent as well.Overall the problem is really with setup and connection. I don't know whether this can be fixed with a firmware update or not. Hopefully so. But in a market where the consumer is flooded with options on what to purchase issues like that are going to be a problem.
4,I tend to be more critical of wireless earbuds and headphones when they are in the $100+ range because there are so many great options and the market is quite saturated with overpriced junk.These are my first pair of Skullcandy headphones even though I'm quite familiar with the brand. The packaging and presentation are really nice and included in the box are extra ear tips a (short) USB-C cable instructions the charging case and the earbuds themselves.While it's not necessary Skullcandy does have an app for Android that you can use with these headphones but it's very lack-luster and you can't really do much with it.  Hopefully firmware updates are provided through the app even though there's no specific "update firmware" section in it.Pairing these up with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ was easy but a little unconventional at the same time. For example I have two "Indy Fuel" listings as paired Bluetooth devices even though I can only connect to one  of them. When I set up the Tile feature (which is AWESOME!) it needed me to activate both earbuds separately so perhaps that's just how they work.The Tile feature is a wonderful addition that adds value to this package. If you aren't familiar Tile products are usually sold in these small square keychains that you attach to keys your backpack or other valuables you want to find or locate if lost or misplaced. I own several Tiles which I use in all of my backpacks but being able to find these earbuds if they are misplaced is really cool and considering that true wireless earbuds are easily lost I think every pair should come with the Tile feature.The battery case doesn't look like anything special but it does include wireless charging and a USB-C port for charging that way. I also love that the case has three lights to indicate its battery level (instead of just one). The case does not lock but it has a snap lid that's secure and hasn't failed on me. Putting the earbuds in the case is dead simple and you can't really mess it up as they can only fit their designated left or right slot.The earbuds are very comfortable and I've used them all day day-after-day without issue. I love that you can use them both at the same time or individually. If I'm working or need my hearing to be clear I will often use just one. Even though these buds have an ambient mode it's not as good as I'd like.The design of these buds can be problematic for men with beards. I've had instances where the long arm of the bud would rub against my beard when my jaw moves which sends that scratchy beard sound to my ear that's wearing the bud. You may not even notice this if your music is loud or obviously if you don't have a beard!These buds connect with the SBC codec which is an old standard that maximizes compatibility and stability at the expense of quality and latency. To be honest the audio quality from these earbuds is much better than I expected and they've been a pleasure to listen to.While the bass isn't skull-crushing it's not weak either. The mids and highs are clear and the overall sound is good.While I don't tend to keep my phone too far from my earbuds the range of these buds has allowed me to go to different rooms without trouble. I did have some initial connection inconsistencies the first day I was using them but then it went away. I'm not exactly sure what caused it but it seems to be resolved now.The battery life is a respectable 6 hours and they recharge quickly in the case so it's a non-issue.It does lack features like active noise cancellation (passive noise cancellation is still pretty good!) and multi-point connectivity for pairing with multiple devices at the same time but I think that most people will be happy with these.
3,I really like the fact that these earbuds are able to charge wirelessly in the case. This is something that I appreicate a whole lot as I've really grown accustomed to being able to dumping everything on my charger and not having to think about it.The battery life is quite respectable on these and at least for me they last long enough that I'd want to take a break from having these in my ear in time to give them a quick charge anyways.Unfortunately there were some cut corners. The case feels really cheap and really doesn't hold a candle to the plastics used in the other true wireless earbuds by the premium brands... though in fairness those do cost quite a bit more.I don't usually encounter bluetooth issues at home but for whatever reason I did find that this pair had some issues with holding a connection. It seems to lose connection to my Peloton occasionally and while the bike is quite finnicky about bluetooth I also noticed the same when connected to my phone which is normally rock solid. Perhaps related to this is the fact that wireless performance is quite limited: I found that the little invisible tether to my phone prevents me from even going over to the next room over without bringing my phone with me.The fit is good - I found these comfortable to wear and l was able to wear them during light excercise without any issues.In terms of sound quality I found these to be probably fine for the target market: the bass is a little overwhelming but the overall sound is good enough that I find it to be reasonably nice to listen to. It is a step up from the pack-in's that phone vendors still insist on putting in. You really can do much worse than this.
2,I don't feel like I'm unreasonably picky when it comes to sound quality in headphones/earbuds but I definitely know the difference between something that sounds good to me and doesn't and unfortunately these Skullcandy Indy Fuel's just aren't doing it for me.  It's always hard to describe exactly how or why something sounds good or bad but compared to my other true wireless earbuds even ones that are in the same price neighborhood as these I find everything about the output of these earbuds anemic other than the bass.  A good bass line comes through relatively clearly and well defined with these earbuds but everything else sounds like listening to a speaker covered in a tarp or something.  Hi-hats and other parts of songs I'm very familiar with sound just kind of muted and blurry to me.My other problem with these has been the app support is kind of flaky at best.  It seems the Skullcandy app will try to go through the pairing process every single time I open it despite appearing to have successfully set up and connected to the earbuds previously and sometimes it just fails to detect them even though they are clearly connected to my phone in the bluetooth settings and working fine.  I was also really stoked about the Tile support built into these as I'm already a Tile user and although I was eventually able to succeed in adding the earbuds to my Tile account it was an exercise in frustration that took about a hundred times longer than it should have as the Tile app just would not find the earbuds - only sheer persistence in trying and trying again and going through the process in the Tile app over and over eventually convinced them to work.  After I finally got them added they did work like regular Tiles but the beep feature to help finding them once you get close to the last known location is almost useless since it seems to use the regular speakers in the earbuds instead of a separate simple and loud beeper like Tiles do so it's extremely quiet.It's not all bad though.  The case is easy to use getting the earbuds in and out of the case can be done without thinking about it at all they just drop in and start charging - no fiddling required.  The case does charge via USB-C but it seems it won't charge using my USB-C phone charger with PD for some reason it will only charge with a USB-A to USB-C cable like the one included in the box which is kind of a shame.  The earbuds themselves I find are comfortable enough and seem to stay in my ears just fine after selecting the right size tips.  The touch sensitive controls on either of the earbuds are relatively intuitive to use if not a little overly sensitive as even just accidentally brushing against them for a split second while scratching your ear and making a small adjustment to the fit will usually cause some kind of unintended action.  Outside noise isolation seems about average for earbuds without noise cancellation.The combination of the poor showing with the ease of use with the apps the lack of actual useful features in the app like a full EQ the spotty setup experience with tile and the underwhelming sound quality (to me anyway) kind of make this difficult for me to recommend as they are today but keep in mind if reading this review in the future that apps change and bugs get fixed so a number of my complaints may have already been resolved and I may not have come back to the review yet to adjust it.
3,I was all excited to use these as I go through earbuds by the ton and I am thrilled that these are wireless.I don't hate these  but they are really middle of the road earbuds.  The sound is okay in fact everything is okay - not great with these earbuds.Sound feels like it is coming from far.  There is no static but I have to increase the volume quite a lot to get it to a "normal" level.Using these is easy enough after a little bit of adjustment.  I have a problem with the "ear" part because I have very tiny ears and anytime I put the earbuds into my ear I have to remove them periodically and rub my ears before putting them back in but this is a problem I have with ALL earbuds.Basically there is nothing horrible with these but they are truly middle of the road and not sure the price point reflects the flaws in these.
5,I've really been enjoying using these Skullcandy earbuds. (Skullcandy Indy Fuel True Wireless Earbuds Chill Grey (S2IFW-N744)). They've got serious longevity and staying power - the charge lasts forever and the charging case is really convenient. I love the sound - they didn't cheap out on the bass and it kind of hits the perfect spot.One of my favourite features about these headphones is also a great idea and a unique collaboration - you can locate these using the Tile app. I have been using Tile products for about 3 years now and they've helped me out of a lost item jam or two in the city so this was a refreshing and welcoming partnership. I fear less losing these earbuds knowing they've got Tile tracking them.To summarize these are stylish comfortable great-sounding ear buds by Skullcandy.
3,As earbuds the audio quality on these is a miss for me. The music lacks definition nothing feels as crisp as it should be. I tried changing the equalizer however I was not able to get a sound profile that I would say I am happy with. I did try the various tips to see if this would improve it however I had no luck. Having the different sized tips helped reduce the outside noise at least but that's about it.The charging case is built well and I found that the gestures are great. They're sensitive enough that it does not feel like I'm pushing something into my ear drum and work every time. There are a few gestures to remember however the Play/Pause and Skip buttons are what I use most and I learned these quickly.
3,I am not impressed with Skullcandy Indy Fuel True Wireless Earbuds. As soon as I took out of box i was not very impressed with overall design. It looks more targeted towards teens and students. My frustration started when I tried to pair it with my Thinkpad. It was difficult. The frustration further grew as connection keeps dropping when I move away from laptop may  be in next room. The sound quality is decent but overall these are not great value for the price. I would have tested it extensively other features but this bluetooth issues unfortunately makes it painful to continue testing other features.
4,Skullcandy Indy Fuel True Wireless Earbuds are nicely made. The sound quality is good and bass is decent. The earbuds stay put in my ears even when I move around. There is built mic so you can take calls with them. They don't hurt my ears after an extended period of time.The charging case works well. The total battery life is pretty long. The pairing and connection are good. The built in Tile technology is interesting but you need to download an app for that. Overall I don't have too much to complain.
3,This is not the first set of completely wireless headsets I've used so when I first tried the earbuds I was surprised that I could not get both buds to work. Only the left side functioned. I had to play with them the instruction sheet didn't really help either and when I went to pair them with my phone I ended up seeing two individual earbuds with identical names. I could pair with one but then not the other. it was rather frustrating and I ended up tossing them in a drawer for about a week until I had more time to play.When I went back to them and tried the same process outlined in the instructions I didn't get any further. What finally got them to communicate was long pressing about 15 seconds on the button each bud has at the same time. Then the LED located on the top of each started flashing red and blue. after a few seconds they parried and I was then able to pair the "set" on my phone. I also paired them with my laptop without any difficulty.► For several weeks now they have been performing great and there have been o more issues with pairing either between the buds or the devices I use them with.Audio quality is good not great but good. Frequency response from hi to low is ok but I just don't get the same sort of immersive experience as I do with Jaybirds or Bose earbuds. These other options are a few dollars more but they definitely sound better.I get about 5 hours of run-time per charge. It's nice that the buds can be charged off of the carry case battery but it still takes a fair but of time to get enough of a charge into them for a few hours of use. In other words they really are only good for about a day on one charge.► I nice change as far as charging goes the case has a USB C connector this is the new standard and I'm happy to not have an extra micro USB cable hanging around.What I do really like about them is the form factor. I always have better luck keeping them in my ears when the battery is in the lower dongle portion of the earbud.► While the fit is pretty good I find that the gel doesn't go far enough into the ear canal it sits very shallow which does allow the buds to slip out at times. It also keeps the bass from really coming through once a gel doesn't seal properly the bass quality goes down dramatically. It's like listening to them while placing a bud in your ear. You can hear it but the audio quality is poor until properly tucked into the ear canal an then once the gel is sealed things start to really sound better.One thing to note: With any kind of audio product how it sounds is a very personal thing. I can only tell you how I enjoyed this headset and what it sounded like for me. You'll probably have a different experience but this is what equalizers were made for and in most cases making a few tweaks on an equalizer will produce a more pleasing result for virtually anybody. This is also why headsets come with different sizes of gels.Overall they sound ok and battery life is ok and there is nothing spectacular to mention.
3,These earbuds exhibit good sound quality and are easy to insert and stay in place firmly. Having a fully wireless connection (i.e. earbuds not wired together) is really convenient. Once I realized how to properly insert them they are very comfortable (the mic-bar should sit at an approximately 45° angle downward – if you insert the buds so that the bar sits horizontally they stay in place very well but are very uncomfortable).HOW I USE EAR BUDSI listen to music relatively quietly and appreciate noise isolation more than most. I primarily listen to music but also use earbuds for occasional phone calls. I have the earbuds linked to my Samsung S10+ phone.WHAT’S INCLUDEDIncluded are two earbuds a charging case with integrated battery a short USB to USB-C charge cable and a total of three different-sized covers for each earbud and a total of two pairs of rubber spacers (allows you to adapt to smaller ear openings). Also included is a quick start guide and basic instructions. Note that you will need a USB power supply to charge these earbuds. I really like that the case include a USB-C charge input as most modern phones utilize this type of connection.INSERTING AND WEARING EARBUDSThese earbuds are very easy to insert and stay in place firmly once seated. When inserting they need to be slightly rotated to stay in place. Once seated the earbuds are effective at passive noise isolation and stay in place very well. As mentioned previously the mic bar should be sitting at an approximately 45° angle when the earbuds are properly inserted.CONTROLSEach earbud has a single button; the button on each earbud has the similar functionality. Single tap-and-hold for last track (left) or next track (right) single tap for volume down (left) or up (right) double tap for play/pause or to answer calls triple tap to activate voice assistant. There are also shortcuts to change EQ modes and turn on ambient mode. I find it difficult to get the right command when tapping on these earbuds. Note that even commands requiring single tap actually require slightly holding to properly activate.BATTERY LIFEBattery life is rated at 6 hours (plus 24 hours of juice stored in the case). It’s hard for me to judge accuracy on this though since I store my earbuds in the case (so they always recharge themselves).TILE CAPABILITYThese buds can be linked to Tile to allow you to locate them better. I don’t use the Tile app (I removed it from my phone because it was contributing a lot to battery drain) so I can’t confirm how well this feature works but it is a cool feature to build into the earbuds.SOUND QUALITYSound quality is good but I do find they are more tinny sounding than my other buds especially in non-music scenarios (podcasts voicecalls video) even when on the ‘podcast’ EQ mode. I have Jaybird wireless earbuds that cost almost twice as much – I definitely prefer the Jaybirds but these produce good sound quality when listening to music. I also have much cheaper UGreens that provide much better non-music quality and similar music quality. Using these for voice calls also works well (though I find the other person’s voice to sound tinny) – people I’ve talked to say I come through clearly. I also experienced some seemingly random disconnects of the earbuds – it happened frequently when I first started using them but infrequently now… when this happens the earbud reconnects almost immediately but cuts out for a second or so.OVERALLI like these earbuds for listening to music but would recommend looking elsewhere if your primary use is for non-music listening. I also find that the integrated buttons are harder to operate than other wireless earbuds I have and I’m frustrated by the occasional connection drops.
4,Been using for a year. Decent pair of buds. One full charge lasts almost 5-7 days with moderate usage. The sound quality wont blow your mind but is quite decent (12 mm drivers). ANC will actually surprise you that its so so good at this range.The ambient sound also is nice and natural.Mic is also good for taking calls.IPX4 water and sweat resistant.Overall a very good buy.
3,It interrupts the music and sometimes causes it to stop completely even when paired with the skullcandy app. Can only be fixed by turning them off and on again. Noise cancellation and battery life is perfect tho
1,I purchased this on 04 Aug 2020 through Amazon. Delivery was on the stipulated time.Right off the bat let me clear some doubts about this product:1. It cannot pair with more than one device at once. This is a huge letdown and the reason I'm mentioning it is because none of the online reviews or even the product website care to talk about it. You need to go to the bluetooth settings and unpair your device before pairing it with something else.2. The range of the product is barely 10 feet without any walls. With walls good luck at even 3 feet.Pros:1. Good Bass. I liked the music quality overall2. The case looks pretty cool3. Extremely comfortable in the earCons:1. Mic Quality is AWFUL. The listener on the other end cannot hear a thing you are saying and during a call you have to keep asking if the other person can hear you.2. Within 14 days of product receipt the right earbud charging point in the case has stopped working. There is absolutely no charging happening and my right earbud has gone off completely.3. Even when both earbuds were working perfectly there were many instances where I would pair them directly by taking them outside the case and they would just not give any sound. The song would be played in pieces with constant interruptions (even though i was right in front of my phone).4. There are ZERO skullcandy service centers in India. ZERO. All their servicing takes place through a third party called brand eyes. After my case has partially stopped working I have been calling their helpline continuously for three days. No response. I called their corporate office. No response. I have written them an email. No response.I would definitely not recommend this earphone to anyone.EDIT: As per the SkullCandy Warranty in India their only licensed servicing happens in Brandeyes whose head office is in Lucknow. After many email to and fros I have been told to ship the faulty product to Lucknow on my own expense. So outside of spending 8k on this piece of garbage I have to pay more to ship it to their service center in Lucknow. On top of that they REFUSE to provide any contact number on their end to give the courier person (couriers need a contact number of the receiver in case they need help reaching the place).
2,I would say the earbuds have good quality sound but they're very fiddly to get into your ears and the ends slip off quite easily when putting them in your ear or taking them out.Also after about a month or two of using them the right earbud stopped working properly and would only play music at a very low volume. I searched around and found it's quite a common problem. After going through both Amazon and Skullcandy support I was unable to remedy the situation.
4,This product is great but unfortunately they can become clogged and one will be quieter than the other they  can be quite annoying as sometimes only one connects and you have to reconnect them and play around with them for 5 minutes to get them working properly again
2,Everything is good bud the product stopped working after 1 year of usage and support denying service as the warranty is over. At-least you can give service for repair than .It’s not a cheap use an throw bud . I suggest better go for 3k-4K range use until it’s alive.
2,Sound and noice cancelling was great but the issue with the buds charging and frequent need to completely reset them is nightmare
4,The earbuds are great overall though the Bluetooth can be a bit temperamental trying to connect to devices - definitely not a major issue but can be an annoyance. The noise cancelling is great and really useful when you need to focus on a task without distractions. Overall these are a really solid set of earbuds and very competitively priced versus similar Apple and Samsung products.
2,I used it for 2yrs. Right piece is always a problem. Won't charge nor connects. I got it replaced under warrenty but now the replaced one also same problem after 7 months of usage
5,This was a great purchase for my teenage son!
3,Good quality product  but  less bass  and not as I expected
5,ランニングやウォーキングの時に使っています。が、時々音が飛びます。たくさんのイヤホンを試しで使ってみましたが私の耳にはこれが1番フィットしていました。
3,1. Works better with android phones when compared to i phones2. Getting wired sound when ANC is turned on3. Customisation via skullcandy app is very tedious. It takes 2-3 times / 5-6 mins to show that earphones are connected to phone4. some times sound only hears in single earbudsOver all not satisfactory and disappointed
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The sound quality of the earbuds  is very good but i had a only one problem with that the case of the ear buds are not properly close after putting earbuds in the case and thats y I replaced it but I got the same problem again😖
2,These earphones are not great. The sound is average no bass. They are not very comfortable. When running they will lose sound if you turn your head at all. Setting them up is not fun. Are they worth £50 ABSOLUTELY NOT. These are 15 - 20 EarPods at BEST. I seriously don’t recommend them at all.
3,Although it's built quality was so good but unfortunately their was white noise issue during the call. I had to return it.
1,
1,I used these earphones for a while and were great for a time then after a bit the sound dropped right down now my old headphones are louder
2,Pros -Fair value for moneyGood sound qualityWireless charging and type cCons -Bad user experience. Connecting to device is a hassle.Connectivity issues - both earbuds are never in sync. Have to re connect them 3-4 times to get them working togetherUseless app can’t really do anything in itIne earbud has stopped working after a month of use. It’s powering off again and again.Conclusion- I would stay away from these earbuds. Am regretting buying them. Really bad experience considering the price.
4,Good
1,Doesn't connects normally. Seems like a rocket science u need to reset and disconnect with all the devices when you connect to new one.Charging stopped working in two days first for right bud then left.
5,The media could not be loaded.
4,quality of music is really good it has different modes such as ambient so you can still hear background noise podcast mode if your listening to podcasts and music mode that blocks out any background noise. noise cancelation. They fit perfectly on me. and a built in tracker incase you lose one or the other
5,低音重視だと思いますが個人的には最高です。
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Left bud not working when registered a complaint with company they did not reply properly and when called customer care he hanged up the phone without solving the issue
3,noise cancellation rubbish
2,These hurt my ears so much the ‘fins’ were very uncomfortable and they didn’t pair correctly at all. Save your money and get something more decent. Also trying to send these back were  a nightmare! The seller doesn’t give you the option of sending them back via Royal Mail. And we can’t drive so it was very difficult.
2,These are very uncomfortable ears starts to pain when we wear it for a long time
3,Die Kopfhörer sind sogesehen echt gut aber nach kürzester Zeit lassen sich beide nicht mehr mit einander verbinden das mann nur mit einem hören kann und mit den anderen nicht mehr und da durch kann man an ihnen auch keine Lautstärke mehr einstellen.Echt schade.
5,Rispetto ad altri prodotti simili non ha eguali in rapporto qualità prezzo e in prestazioni
1,Los he comprado como regalo y sólo dan fallos me han dado otros porque no hacia ni un mes que los tenia y vuelven a fallar los mismos. La verdad un fracaso para la buena pinta que tenían....
5,Superb quality and sound awesome best gift for me on my birthday thank you amazon😇🙏🏻
1,be carefull while ordering these might be a possibility that these can be damaged. in my case right bud wasnt working.
1,Using this with iphone. Connection keeps breaking every 15 minutes. Sometimes only one earbud works. If lucky move phone or your head around and it may restore otherwise you need to disconnect them completely and reconnect. Extremely annoying and almost fraudulent given the price point.ANC is very spotty when using ANC the earbuds start giving static/crackling noises. Again if lucky it may go away. If not disconnect them and completely reconnect. Disappointing from Skullcandy. If these are firmware issues they should really fix at priority.
1,Unfortunately one of the earbuds stopped working after only been used a few times. Maximum of 5 hours use.Item returned .They were comfortable to wear and had seemed a good product
1,the sound comes through tinny and low quality they hurt to wear and use difficult to set up wouldnt charge when you put them back into their charging case. like just comedically awful for such a high price tag. only reason i havent returned them is amazons return system is terrible.
5,No issues with this earbuds they sound full and clean. It takes a bit to get used to touch controls a very good product.
1,Don't buy. The buds are too big and too complicated touch controls. The software is very bad. NO MULTIPLE DEVICE SUPPORT. Too many pairing issues also. The tile tracker is also useless it makes sound which is lower than general earphone levels and not at all audible. Sound quality is OK. If u are an audiophile then don't even consider it. Galaxy buds and Galaxy buds plus are miles better in all aspects. NO USE of buying. Expected a lot more from Skullcandy.
1,Right earbud was damaged after 8 months of usage. Battery was draining in less than 5 minutes of usage. I got a replacement since it was still under the warranty period. But same issue happened with the replacement after couple of months of usage.
5,Very good headphones. Comfortable very quickly connected to phone. Using them for 4 months everyday no problem.
1,Everytime I'm buying Skullcandy i regret it... This time the right earpiece will not charge. Last time that I bought a product the Headphones stopped working after about a month... For the few times that I did use the product the Sound was fairly decent I'll give 'em that...
5,Guter Sound alles top jedoch jedes Mal wenn ich die benutze kommt nach einer Zeit kein Ton mehr aber die Musik spielt weiter. Ich weiß aber leider nicht woran das liegt
2,Poor Ear FittingExtra some sound
1,Nach nicht mal zwei Wochen hat das rechte Ohrteil nicht mehr geladen kann ein Produktionsfehler sein sollte aber bei dem Preis nicht vorkommen.
5,absoulutly perfect
1,Had these 1 week and had to send back due to only one working earphone so can’t comment on noise cancelling sound quality or volume control
1,I started to use this product. At first it was very good except for a few minor setbacks like lags during gaming very sharp treble(the s sounds where harsh on high volume). Later on one fine morning the right bud stopped charging and was always low battery. Eventually it died. Amazon was very helpful in returning the product and I got the full refund very quick. Thanks AMAZON!!
1,Less than 1 month old and the left earbud has stopped working very poor for what they cost. I won’t be buying skullcandy again
5,Bien
1,Dont buy it.Received yesterday and one of the ear buds was not working.Ordered return and was surprised that only replacement is possible .I would like to raise my voice to Amazon that i have been a customer for many years and you can verify the same with my account details.I need return and not replacement.Aman Monga
1,
1,Had to return them. One earpiece stopped responding to touch input so I was not able to pair them together.
5,Excellent fit sound weight. Pleased
1,L'écouteur droit ne fonctionne pas bouton défaillant. Pour le prix que l'on paye sa engage vraiment une super qualité à long termes 👌 Horrible !!!!
1,Anfangs hat alles gut funktioniert die Steuerung ist etwas verwirrend aber nach 2 Tagen nutzen war es schon recht einfach.  Der Sound ist auch nicht schlecht. Aber das die Kopfhörer nach 2 Wochen nicht mehr im charging case laden ist dann doch schon ein Witz. Kann die nicht mehr benutzten da sie kein Akku mehr haben.
1,The eartips are faulty.The earbud doesn’t fix properly in the case so that they don’t charge properly.I’ve got 3 right wing tips and only 1 left wingtips.Waste of money dumb product.
1,I connect it my iphone in the beginning then it probably takes more than 20 attempts to connect to the laptop........and just after one week I bought it they decreased the price.....
1,Worst quality from skull candy !!Dont buy this crapDont know why amazon is selling this !! Making full out of people
1,Looks good but I received the defect product the left side earbud is not work I am totally disappointed for this I thought Skullcandy is premium product but now I have to rethink about buying Skullcandy my rating for this product is 0.05/5
1,Entkoppeln sich andauernd vom iPhone reinste Katastrophe die Teile.Sound ist gut
5,Great to use
1,Build quality is worst. Spending 7500 bucks on such low quality product is worthless.sound quality is good but in built mic is not that responsive.Either go for Samsung galaxy buds plus or Apple AirPods Pro.
1,Within one month use . Left bud has not charging.🥴
1,Wurden defekt geliefert
1,Wirklich enttäuschend! Die Kopfhörer funktionieren wie sie wollen! Die Bluetooth Verbindung ist ein Krampf! Teilweise versuche ich über 10min die Kopfhörer ohne Erfolg zu verbinden! Absolut untauglich!!!
1,Poor quality product. Sound in all EQ modes is really flat. Call quality is average. No value for money spent. Not expected a subpar product from Skullcandy.
1,Value for money is very bad pairing connection problem battery performance is also very bad. Long time wearing is not good. Ear pain.
1,After using for 3 months one earbud is not charging
1,Worst quality while call. waste of money
1,Very low
1,Bad product  after 20/30 product not working My product in detected nowAnd now I am unable to do something
1,Waste of money sound quality is very poor
1,My product wasn't working properly even after I replaced it
1,Worst product never try this thanks to god i got my refund
1,Very disappointed product
1,Not satisfied
1,tfhtftfyfy
2,No están hechos para uso rudo tiene menos de 6 meses que los compré y ya tienen un falso contacto se les tiene que adaptar algo más para que carguen de manera adecuada. Además de que no respetan las garantía por haberlos comprado en Amazon de Estados Unidos.Osea que si se descomponen ya no hay manera de recuperarlos. Un poco decepcionado. La calidad de Audio es buena pero los audífonos por sí solos tienen muchos detallitos.
5,Están bien son buenos y se escucha muy bien y claro
4,so far so good
5,Entrega confiable y rápida el producto original y excelente calidad de audio
1,Wont stay in my ear after a few months of use. Customer service won't do anything to help. Ok product  very poor customer service.  Would not buy again
5,Muy cómodos buen sonido y muy buena duración de batería la carga de batería inalambrica super eficiente y estéticamente bastante bonitos
3,Se escuchan bien pero el volumen es muy bajo.Los controles son muy confusos
1,A los 3 meses dejaron de funcionar y no tienen reparación.El sonido era bueno la cancelación de ruido bastante bien.
4,Una maravilla es asombroso su calidad para el precio que tiene son muy cómodos y fáciles de vincular
5,Los he usado sin parar. Son increíblemente buenos y tienen un super buen nivel de cancelación de ruido y tienen de lo mejor en calidad de audio. No los recomiendo para audiofilos los recomiendo para uso diario. Los modos de sonido te dan una mejor definición de los sonidos necesarios en el modo película es de bajos contundentes y medios claros en el modo musica es un poco más balanceado con un realce de agudos en graves en el modo podcast mejora la conversación y la voz humana es excesivamente clara. Lo único que no me gustó es la batería si lo tienes a un volumen por arriba de la mitad dura menos de 5 HRS con el Anc encendido. Pero nada malo ya que normalmente en un ambiente calmado los tienes de la mitad a abajo con el Anc encendido y no necesitas subirle más a menos que haya mucho ruido o te guste mucho el sonido fuerte
3,Not the best headphones for such a price they frequently just start do make a fuzzy sound instead of music that it should be playingeven when using the Skullcandy app for better connectivitywhen using them both sometimes it happen that left bud just disconnects and over 4-5 min will come online again.very disappointed.
1,I bought these headphones to keep in my work bag as a backup in case I forget my Bose QC earbuds. I have only used them about 3 times for an 8 hour block on and off although I have had them for about 4 months give or take. The sound quality is just okay (I grant you I am a sound snob) but the sound quality out of these is maybe a 4/10 if that. I’m not a big fan of the buds that go deeper into your ears I prefer the ones that can rest in your ear yet still don’t fall out  (like the Bose do) the noise canceling is just okay again. (I realize I’m comparing these to a pair that costs more than double but still). For around $120 I think I payed for these it isn’t a bad deal. HOWEVER today on use #3 or 4 like I mentioned earlier. The Right ear bud will NOT power on even though it has a light on when I’m case and the left one pairs and plays music fine. Let me clarify I have not dropped these or been rough with them. And they have not had enough use to break. Yet again I have the same problem as I had before I had a higher end pair of earbuds. Just buy the more expensive ones. I promise you it WILL be cheaper than buying a dozen cheap pairs that don’t sound nearly as good. I’m sorry to write a negative review but I am NOT satisfied with this the build quality is very poor! And I would not recommend these. (Apologies for the poorly formatted and scatter brain review. I don’t have time to re read it edit and so on.)Hope this helps you and saves you some money.
4,Los audífonos en cuestión de sonido la calidad es excelente los perfiles y todo lo demás es genial el problema es que estos el lado izquierdo ya no cargo y se ha muerto solo sirve el lado derecho no tienen ni el año (8 meses) el uso que les di es normal  (1-2 veces por semana). Creo que en México no se puede mandar a garantía los productos comprados en Amazon.
4,Todo bien hasta pasado un mes que el audifono  izquiero  acaba  de dejar dde funcionar tienen garantia???
5,Hola a todos los futuros compradores yo compré estos audífonos en febrero del 2021 y hasta el mes noviembre del 2021 dejaron de funcionar primer problema no son buenos para ejercicio se mueven y se caen segundo problema a veces la cancelación no funciona correctamente y último problema ! Dejo de funcionar el centro de carga ya no cargaba mi audífono derecho! Y si eres de otro país que no sea EUA no te van hacer válida la garantía! Es un desperdicio de dinero! Que coraje que ni la garantía me acepten ! NO GASTEN SU DINERO HAY OTRAS MEJORES OPCIONES!
5,No funciona para nada bien en una computadora muy difícil conectarla y que se escuche bien. Solo funciona en celulares en mi iphone no tengo problema.
2,No lo recomiendo los he intentado usar para llamadas con el cel nunca se escucha bien siempre tengo quejas que suena robótico que hay mucho ruido. Los he intentado en llamadas en la computadora lo mismo. Para la música mas o menos bien de pronto se va el sonido.Por otro lado no muy cómodos y se caen con facilidad.Desearía haberlos regresado cuando estaba a tiempo.
2,No se puede vincular el lado izquierdo.
3,Son cómodos y bonitos pero no los recomiendo el case no cierra apropiadamente y eso puede hacer que no cargue correctamente. En mi caso de mala experiencia a los 3 meses de uso el audífono izquierdo dejó de cargar (medio moviendolo a veces carga pero tengo que dejarlo en esa posición)  no tuvo uso rudo ni nada los pines magnéticos se ven bien. A 5 meses de uso el derecho también dejó de cargarse e igual los pines se ven bien. Ya reclame garantía pero no es válida por que no me lo vendió Amazon Mexico o skullcandy
2,Lo compré hace dos meses y un audifono ya no sirve ya no se escucha la comodidad de rato se van saliendo los audífonos de las orejas tienen problemas con audio personalizado dentro de la aplicaciónSe escuchan bien pero no duran lo suficiente
1,Sirvieron un mes y se descompusieron no son recomendables.
1,El audífono derecho dejó de funcionar al mes. Esperaba más de estos audífonos.
1,I bought this product and used it for a while and now the left earbud is not working properly. The customer service is worst than their product. Not worth of money.
3,Can only connect to one device. Price and quality is good but not as user friendly as air pods.
5,recibí 3 veces el mismo producto debido a las mismas fallas en cada equipo. los fallos siempre se presentaban de una a dos semanas después de la adquisición y se presentan como un fallo al cargar los audífonos hasta un audífono sonando mas fuerte que el otro.no lo devolví una 3ra vez debido a la incomodidad que esto me presentaba sin embargo puedo aseverar que este es un terrible producto
5,Buena calidad de audio las baterías duran bastante tiempo pero después de mucho tiempo de uso continuo puede llegar a ser un poco incómodo
5,Los controles táctiles son bastante confusos.
4,Muy buen sonido y compatibilidad con iOS sin embargo dejo de funcionar el auricular izquierdo y tuve que devolver. Como Nota para aquellos que vayan a considerar comprarlos debo mencionar que skullcandy méxico no hace válida la garantía para aquellos productos comprados por amazon y que vengan de estados unidos una tonteria en mi opinión por lo que deben solicitar un reembolso desde amazon y ellos te ayudaran a gestionar la devolución.
4,Tengo que ser completamente honesto al principio pensé en devolver los audífonos por las constantes "caídas" en cuanto escuchaba música o podcast sin embargo esto cambio el los últimos días con la reciente actualización del Firmware (0009) las caídas y cortes de audio se redujeron bastante si bien aun pasan estas son menos frecuentes que con el fimware anterior. Con respeto a la calidad del audio Skullcandy siempre hace énfasis en los bajos por lo tanto si buscan un sonido completamente plano pueden abstenerse de ellos pero si no les molesta presentan una buena relación calidad costo.

4,Se descompusieron al mes y no hacen válida la garantía por qué el vendedor no da factura de compra nacional
5,Me enamore en seguida recomendable al 100%
5,Charge lasts all day (I use them at work to listen to my music). Never had a single issue. I am happy with my purchase as I have always found Skullcandy to be an awesome value for money product that is way underrated.
5,Buena relación precio calidad
5,Muy buen producto en relación precio-calidad
5,Tengo 1 mes usandolos la cancelacion de ruido a comparacion de los airpods pro tienen una ligera diferencia siendo estos calidad precio aceptable y el envio llego antes de lo previsto.Mi experienciaLa carga maxima del estuche es aproximadamente 30 min pero desde los 10 min ya puedes desconectarlos sin problemas.Para quienes estan interesados en la calidad a nivel tecnico cuenta con certificaciones nacionales (en mi caso Mexico) e internacionales garantizando un producto aprobado y de confianza.La ergonomia es eficiente teniendo mucho agarre para salir a caminar correr y saltar pero hay que tomar en cuenta si las gomas son las adecuadas para nuestro oido en mi caso las que ya venian puestas son compatibles pero tambien cuenta con otros tamaños.El estuche no he probado su resistencia en caidas pero la marca cuenta 2 años de garantia y los audifonos se me cayo al piso y no hubo ninguna falla fisica auditiva y electronica.La calidad de audio permite escuchar bajos agudos y graves agradable y muy presentes los escuche con musica electronica clasica rock r&b rap opera y instrumental escuchandose de maravilla para audifonos de esta categoria.Para las llamadas el audio es muy comodo se escucha bien y el microfono tiene buena calidad al emitir sonido. Me sirvio bastante para las clases en linea cuando estoy en el transporte y caminando con la opcion de cancelacion de ruido activada.El modo ambiental que solamente se activa con la app me permitio seguir conversando y caminando entre las calles sin ningun problema escuchando armonicamente la musica video/clase en linea y podcast con el ruido exterior teniendo perdidas equilibradas de sonido estando atento a mi alrededor sin perder lo que este escuchando del movil.La app skullcandy es una buena herramienta que tendras usandola cada vez que escuches musica porque los modos de sonido si ocurren cambios muy notorios enriqueciendo la musica la voz de las personas o el ambiente en las peliculas para que funcione correctamente ocuparas tambien activar la ubicacion. Faltan muchas mejoras como integrar un ecualizador personalizado porque esta muy limitado con los modos musica cine y podcats tambien hay un modo Personal Sound pero solamente es un test de sonidos que no percibi mucha diferencia y espero que lo mejoren en futuros desarrollos.
5,No tenía fe en este tipo de audífonos pero la verdad que estos salieron muy bien y son los que uso para viajar fáciles de configurar y de usar y la batería si les dura bastante tiempo
5,Sound quality is good and walking outside is great without all the noise.
5,I bought this product as a gift for my son and he loves it. thanks
1,El producto decía nuevo y viene con indicios de que ha sido usado incluso viene con los accesorios incompletos
5,Estan super comodos se oyen bastante bien y super fuerte cargan muy rapido y tienen bastante duracion.
4,Eh tenido dos pares de estos audífonos con el mismo final.El primero a mitad de año dejo de funcionar el audífono izquierdo sin ningún motivo.El segundo fue lo mismo dejo de funcionar el audífono izquierdo al año y 1 mes de la misma forma de hecho fue el día de hoy estaba escuchando música y de pronto dejo de funcionar como si se hubiera apagado o desconectado.Ya hice todo lo que se podía hacer y nada.Cuando me muevo se quiere llegar a escuchar o se establece el sonido pero si me muevo por lo más mínimo deja de oírse.En cuestión al costo funcionan muy bien pero algo que se tiene que tomar en cuenta es el tiempo de vida.Un muy buen producto pero que no te dura más de un año así de simple.Lo vale? Siento que puedes encontrar algo más que sea también bueno pero que también tenga un mayor tiempo de vida útil.La vdd un poco decepcionado con la marca.Otra cosa no tiene garantía por parte de skull candy México así que nada espero les allá ayudado.
4,They sound really good have better bass output than I thought they would.  I just wish they were capable of being slightly louder for songs that are recorded quieter.
5,Me encantó la calidad de sonido que te ofrecen la cancelación de ruido es buenísima para el precio en el que los encontré
1,********Aunque es cierto todo lo que escribí en la reseña de este producto debo decir que hace un par de días me llevé una gran decepción el audífono izquierdo ya no encendió y no funciona en la caja de carga  y aunque seguí las instrucciones que dicen en la página oficial de SKULLCANDY esto no me funcionó es por eso que devolveré el producto. La verdad me habían gustado mucho estos audífonos pero que decepción que vengan defectuosos de fábrica espero que esto solo me haya pasado a mí*******Para mí la verdad fue muy fácil vincularlos por primera vez supongo que depende del celular que tengas. La verdad al principio el sonido no me gustó mucho pero la app de skullcandy tiene un modo llamado "personal sound" que es como un "examen auditivo" para que los audífonos te brinden una mejor experiencia de acuerdo a tu audición y vaya que mejora mucho!!! La verdad los recomiendo mucho por el sonido que brindan además el diseño de los audifonos es muy lindo y casi no se notan cuando los tienes puestos además son muy cómodos.Aunque en mi celular funcionan muy bien debo decir que en mi computadora no mucho y esto es un problema que tuve al quererlos conectar a otros dispositivos; tienen mucha interferencia que suele durar entre 10 y 15 segundos además se nota un poco la latencia (cosa que no pasa con mi celular) y se desconectan y para mí esto es muy molesto. Por eso ya solo los uso en mi celular que se vinculan muuy rápido.La cancelación de ruido es regular aunque sí se nota un cambio yo prefiero usarlos sin esta función ya que al estar activa se gasta mucho más rápido la batería y además se logra escuchar un zumbido que en lo personal es muy desagradable aunque no sé si esto solo sea en mis skullcandy. La batería me dura todo el tiempo que los he utilizado a veces los dejo encendidos por la noche y al despertar siguen con batería. La caja de carga me dura por lo general para 2 o 3 cargas.Los comandos touch son muy útiles puedes hacer muchas cosas sin necesidad de tener tu teléfono en la manoAl momento llevo poco más de 3 semanas usándolos y me han parecido muy buenos en relación al precio.
4,Works beyond my expectation only thing the quick command on the device is a bit hard and annoying
1,Los compre en Julio y para Octubre me falló la bocina derecha tiene un falso
5,100% awesomeSound quality ✅Battery life ✅Sound reduction ✅And the whole thing it’s pretty decent ✅Wireless charging ✅I will buy again for my husband father’s day gift..highly recommended 👌🏻
5,Using these buds for longboarding and generally listening while in motion has been great! They stay stuck in your ears provide great sound and let me hear the outside world when I need to.
4,el estuche venia sucio
1,Uno de los audífonos no se escucha cuando lo conecto con otros dispositivos que no sean mi celular. Cuando la cancelación de sonido esta activada se escucha una interferencia demasiado fuerte que lastima los odios. Espere que fueran mejores pero resultaron ser una decepción nunca los recomendaría.
3,En mi opinion el sonido es muy bueno considerando el precio inclusive el bajo suena igual que unos audifonos alambricos de un rango medio lo cual se me hace bastante bueno. Por el lado negativo y razon de mi comentario es que tengo ocho dias con ellos y hay ciertos cortes en el audio la verdad es algo que me tiene preocupado porque al parecer si hay reportes de que es un problema habitual asi que estoy pensando en devolverlos. En un punto intermedio es que el problema del cual hablan donde no cierra bien la tapa se puede "corregir" quitando el plastico para asegurarlo en tu oreja.
3,Esperaba una mejor cancelación de ruido
1,They have a weird echo sound will be returning these
4,Amazing sound quality easy to setup the App is great but I cant wear these for more than an hour without my ears hurting Might just me a "Me" problem though and not the product.
5,Although the arrival time was 5-7 business days it arrived in less than 24 hours. Amazing product and unbelievable real shipping time!
5,Have zero issues with the product
5,Buen producto por el precio pagado tiene modo ambiente
5,Although the arrival time was 5-7 business days it arrived in less than 24 hours. Amazing product and unbelievable real shipping time!
1,They work great for a bit and then they have issues pairing the fix is NOT in the manual or online correctly posted so you have to call customer service to get the correct instructions I’m so fed up with SkullCandy brand and their hit and miss products.
3,The battery life on these is phenomenal. The biggest issue I faced is with the sound quality on these earbuds. The pairing process isn't as seamless as some of the other brands out there in a similar or even cheaper price range (e.g. SoundPeats); this is because even after I took them out of the charging box to pair them and accept the pair request from my phone's Bluetooth menu it keeps asking me to pair the device over and over and when you accept the subsequent pair request the buds tend to run independently and the technical support I reached out to assisted me with resetting the device completely and repairing but advised to not accept any subsequent pair requests after the first. The sound quality improved but I still get a lag every 15-20 seconds when listening to music or watching a video on my phone which I don't get with any other earbud I have used before. The bass is good and call quality is decent enough when it's not cutting out. If I could return these I would. I would suggest going for better options out there to be quite honest. Not the best experience I've had and they're not super comfortable either for long periods of time.
1,Not stay put to my hear and not working after one month
5,The media could not be loaded.
3,Muy buen producto pero el servicio es pésimo..En conclusión los audífonos son muy buenos pero yo los pedí en color gris y me llegaron negros son detalles que al final cuentan mucho además de que tardaron 11 días en llegar
5,Lo que más me ha gustado de estos audífonos es la duración de la batería con la cancelación de ruido activa los he tenido funcionando hasta 7 horas con 30 minutos y con la cancelación de ruido desactivada los probé solo por 9 horas continuas pero aún tenían para dar más.La cancelación de ruido es muy efectiva tengo vecinos muy ruidosos pero colocándome los audífonos llega la calma. Donde trabajo hay demasiado ruido de máquinas neumáticas extractores e inyectores de aire y con estos audífonos es mínimo el ruido perceptible. Sin duda una muy buena compra.El sonido es muy bueno tan bueno que los e utilizado con el volumen en el mínimo la mayor parte del tiempo.El control táctil responde muy bien.Son cómodos y muy ligeros además de traer gomas de diferente medida lo que te permite elegir la que mejor se ajuste a tu oreja o canal auditivo.Comparando precio calidad  sin duda es una muy buena opción.
1,Want to test your patience. Wait until these two earbuds  become unpaired from each other. It does not matter what method you use to try and pair them again it doesn't work. I'd rather jump off a bridge than spend time trying to get these to pair.You'll put them away then magically the next day they'll decide to pair to one another. But nothing will work when you want them. It'll play out of one earphone or the other
1,They won’t sinc to each other so only one earphone works at anytime.
1,Keep reconnecting and looses connect even if my phone is in my pocket. Left & right keeps in syncing.
5,Very nice
1,Empezó a dejar de cargar un auricular
4,Único problema son que a veces los audífonos  se desvinculan/ solo se escuchan de un lado/ estática. Recomiendo que sea comprado con descuento alto
5,El anc es muy bueno pero el modo escuchar sin aislarte es un tanto artificial  esta muy cómodos pero a las 4 horas de usarlos me canso uno  nada que no se tolere y cargan muy rápido  es un poco latoso entender losMenús táctiles y la app es muy simple de usar solo meEncantaría un acceso rápido al anc yo los recomiendo  me gusta ver su tecnología ah y el tile que qué es para localizarlos funciona bien soloMe falta validar la carga inalámbrica
1,Físicamente son muy bonitos se sincronizan facil y se escuchan bien (Siempre y cuando se escuchen bien). Yo pedi devolución ya que se desincronizaban al cambiar de app o de repente se dejaba de escuchar uno o de plano se escuchaban como cuando una bocina esta rota. Si fuera algo que solo me sucedio una vez no tendria problema pero esto era todos los dias 3-4 veces por hora.Usuario de iphone 13.
5,Me encantaron definitivamente. La calidad de sonido esta impresionante y el diseño muy bonito. Para ejercitarse están super prácticos se ajustan muy bien solo que despues de 2 o 3 horas sin quitartelos empiezan a ser incómodos (Aun así los volveria a comprar); las funciones touch son buenísimas también.
5,Bastante buenos el audio y los bajos suenan excelente Skullcandy nos da una excelente experiencia de audio y cancelación de ruido.
5,Cuando los compré no estaba muy seguro si iban a ser buenos audífonos pero la verdad estoy sorprendido. Muy buena calidad de sonido nunca tengo problemas con la batería y son muy cómodos. Sin duda alguna son muy buenos.
4,los audífonos tiene una muy buena calidad de sonido la duración de la pila es bastante buena como los uso todo el tiempo si duran las 9 hora con cancelación de ruido esas nueve horas son contando la carga de los audífonos y de la base en cuanto a la comodidad son grandes para mí gusto deberían ser un poco más pequeños pero depende del oído de cada persona el único detalle fue que el audífonos izquierdo pierde la señal y se deja de escuchar al mover un poco la cabeza puedes tener suerte y se conecta pero sino hay que apagar ese audífono y prenderlo nuevamente tiene para cambiar el efecto de los audífonos si es para música o películas pero en lo general es una muy buena compra
