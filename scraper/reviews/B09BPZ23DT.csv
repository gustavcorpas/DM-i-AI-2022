5,Nice affordable headphones. I bought these headphones because my twins needed it for class. So I figured for the price why not buy bulk and gift some away to my granddaughters and their classmates. These have not given up as they are still being used. I do plan on buying more to gift for Christmas and for extras to carry in the car! If you know what I mean!! My kids are picky but they have yet to complain about  comfort. And they loved the colors!!
5,I teach remedial reading and my middle school students needed headphones with a microphone and to also not be disturbed by others while they were reading aloud.  The students loved getting to pick their color.  I put each student's name on the wide headband.  I had to purchase them with my own funds so I appreciated that they were also affordable.
5,We are really pleased with how well these headphones work for all of our students grades K-12.  They are quite good quality fun colors and a fair price.  The seller is quick to ship and packages everything very carefully.  It has been a pleasure to do business with them! We will be using this seller again and highly recommend their product.
5,The product is loved by teachers as it makes a huge difference in the classroom when children struggle with auditory issues . They help to calm and relax the children so they are not so easily distracted . A much needed product !!! Works works works !!
5,I gave these as a gift to my daughter‚Äôs friend who is a teacher. It was on her wish list. I just contacted her and she said they were great quality! No complaints and no issues from her students are using them. They‚Äôre holding up really well!
5,I originally ordered these expecting them to be bulk throw away items but was very happy to see I was wrong. The units are good quality headphones that work well and stand up to repeated use.
5,I bought these headphones for my 2nd grade classroom and they have been amazing. They fit the students heads well and have been working just fine with our Chromebooks. I like that  the cord is thicker so it is harder to split and so far they been able to withstand the everyday use in our classroom. Would definitely recommend.
5,Got these originally for state testing back in April.  My students like the style colors and most of all the comfort of how they fit.  They are way ahead of the cheap uncomfortable ones provided by the school.  Would definitely recommend for any teacher looking for something above average for their students.  These headphones will NOT disappoint!
5,My kids were going through headphones like crazy so we decided to het this 10 pack. They are holding up better than other headphones in this price range and we are very happy with the purchase!
4,So far so good... I have had them about 4 weeks. My students seem to like them as there have been no complaints!
5,I received a grant to purchase something for my classroom and I chose these. I was NOT disappointed! I am an English teacher and many of my students require audiobooks or noise cancellation. They are also durable unlike others I have bought before. These were perfect. I am so happy with this purchase and will buy again.
5,These headphones work well. I bought 2 boxes and then split them by colors into seperate classrooms. That way we knew which room they belonged to. They work well for our chromebook use.
5,These worked great for classroom use.
4,These headphones are a great inexpensive pair of headphones that have a jack for your computer and other electronics that need a jack. I use these for making phone calls on my computer and the sound is great and I can hear the person on the other end very clearly. Music is clear and crisp. These are great headphones for the price.
5,The quality for the price is amazing. We use headphones every day. The different colored ears allow us to know whose is whose. These are comfortable great sound love the microphone for when using with phone and a call comes in mic quality is great. We are constantly on the move from place to place having the ears turn to lie flat allows us to store them in our backpacks. Very happy with our purchase choice.
5,Great for the price
4,My students have actually mentioned how nice and comfortable they were‚Ä¶very good product üòÉüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª‚úÖüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüòÉ
5,Used for classroom and the quality is great! Very happy with this purchase.
5,So far these headsets have worked well for students and they like the fold-in swivel ear muffs for easy storage. The bright colors is a nice change from the normal gray or black.
5,We purchased these for our grandkids before traveling on a long trip and we passed them out so everyone could be independent and watch or play on their tablets without complaints. This was the best idea ever! We would purchase them again. Well worth the money.A. Leach
5,As a homeschooling mom with multiple kids on laptops these work great. My son used to go thru headphone like crazy the life span of one pair has been amazing!! I would definitely purchase again
5,Bought this set for my classroom.  They‚Äôre perfect for my students to work on video projects!
5,We purchased 40 of these for a donation to a backpack program. They are gorgeous ! The company is very responsive with communication . We were so thankful for such a great price for quality headphones !
5,These headphones are colorful and durable for use by children in a classroom. It helps keep your students arranged by groups or centers easily. It is great for watching videos or listening to audiobooks or for testing when the text can be read. The clear bags they came in did not hold up because they barely fit but I switched them out for gallon-sized ziploc bags instead to keep them organized. Many thanks to Donorschoose and the Oklahoma State Department of Education for providing these for my students!!!
4,Updating this review to add two stars. The company reached out and asked how many headphones were damaged. They quickly dispatched headphones to replace all that have been faulty so far. Feeling more confident that my investment is protected as the company stands by their product.Headphones are not holding up two months later. Ordered thirty pairs for my class of first graders and many pairs have a developed a faulty connection at the plug in causing the sound to go in and out when the plug is bumped. Not reliable really regretting the investment I made. Hoped these would last a couple of years but afraid I‚Äôll have to invest in another set from a different brand for next year.
5,I purchased 30 of these headphones for my classroom. I'm a music teacher and we had tablets and laptops that the students can use in class. My students all love these headphones. The sound quality is great! The ability to cancel out noise around you is great! And the comfort is great! They seem pretty durable because I've used them for a half a school year with about 380 kids and they are holding up great. I purchased the ones with a microphone but have not used them for any projects this year. I will write another review when we have tested the headphones. I will add pictures soon too. I will be buying these again for next school year. Love love love this product.
5,Bought a 10 pack - I haven't tried all of them but the ones I have used are holding up well
5,Purchased for classroom use.  Arrived on time and exactly as described.
4,We are an elementary school and we have purchased these headphones many time.  So far they have worked good for us.  The thing that we like best is that there isn't any buttons or dials for kids to play with.
5,I purchased these headphones for computer use with my 7th-grade students.  These headphones proved to be a very good product at a great price.  They held up to the wear and tear of 13-year-olds so they are a win in my book!
5,20 Black Headsets were purchased for a classroom of adults. There were no issues reported. These headsets will seldom get used so only time will tell but so far so good!
5,These Sonitum headphones are phenomenal and they have lasted in my 3rd Grade classroom all year.  I purchased two sets of 10 headphones and all 20 of them are working at the end of the year.  Highly recommended for any classroom teacher!  These are the most durable and easily adjustable headphones I've come across in 27 years of teaching.
5,These headphones are a wonderful addition to my middle school classroom. Many of my students did not have earbuds or headphones. Students can borrow them as needed and they are easy to sanitize for each of my 6 classes. Highly recommended!
4,For the price these headphones have been pretty good. I bought a pack since my kids destroy them pretty quickly and they have held up longer than most of the others with no complaints of ear pain.
5,Wasn't sure how and what colors I was going to receive with these headphones but the colors I received were green black yellow and red. As for the variety it really is a variety of these plug a blue pair that you might get. I bought these for my small class and left all but 1 in a package because I delivered these to my students but kept 1 for me. The sound quality on these are really good especially when you're online talking. Everything does come out clear and the cord on these is really long. I just did a test run with my students and had all of them use their headphones and just like mine everyone said that the sound came out clear and can get really loud depending on what you have the volume up. I was hoping for a blue pair at least but with the colors that did arrive I'm very happy. For the price I'm very happy with these headphones. The padding on these is really soft and does help with the noise cancelling feature with these headphones.
5,These headphones were a great purchase for my class. They are good quality and fit students well (without falling off). They also look great- students loved the different colors! I have had to purchase new class sets every year because of poor quality from other brands but will be able to use these again. Thank you!
5,My students love the headphones. They comfortable and sound is very clear. I recommend this product for personal or class use.
5,I bought 30 of these headphones for use in my sixth grade classroom.  The price was right for the quality desired.  Students are able to use these easily adjust them to their head as needed and it covers their ear which helps mitigate background noise.  I recommend these headphones to anyone.
5,I bought these headphones for my students. They gave them rave reviews! I've had them for several months and not one has broken! I'm stunned since I teach special education and my kids are tough on their materials. I'll be back for more next school year!
5,My class absolutely loves these and so do I. They are perfect for chromebooks and allow us to us listening stations participate in small group activities without disturbing others and much more. Also the colors make them easy to assign to students and recognize which ones belong to each student. Finally it's perfect that a microphone is included as well making it easy for students to collaborate with each other quietly. I definitely recommend them.
4,Bought these for my classroom. The kids like using the headphones and say they are comfortable. They are used daily and we have not had any problems.
5,I bought these for my kids because well they‚Äôre rough kids and tend to break headphones. There were 10 pairs when we purchased and even with how rough they are we still have all 10! These are the most durable headphones I have found yet!
3,What was I expecting for $12.00?  Nothing too the quality that I got from the headphone that arrived at my door step.  I was relatively pleased with the headphone's build quality.  The headband is nicely padded and the adjustable sliders on the ear cup are made of metal not plastic.  The padding on the ear cups are excellently done and provide maximum comfort especially if you are going to be jamming to some good music for a couple of hours.  Another thing I like is the minimal branding; all you are going to find is two Sonitum logos found on the sides of each ear cup in a dull stainless steel finish.  Also please note that these are on the ear headphones and not over ear headphones.  If you are looking for over the ear headphones please look elsewhere.  The cord that extends from the headphone ends at a gold plated and angled 3.5 mm connector.  The cord is also braided nylon which is shocking.  I'm used to the rubbery plastic type.  As for sound there is plenty of bass but it's natural sounding tight and punchy and doesn't overwhelm the other frequencies of the audio spectrum.  The mids and highs are pretty nice as well.  My setup for listening to music is an iPhone 5S+ with a 3.5mm port (I'm  just not ready for the wireless revolution yet.)  I use Spotify with the equalizer on dance and stream quality set on extreme for maximum enjoyment.BUYER BEWARE! PURCHASE AT YOUR OWN RISK:As much as I have boasted about this product please note - the reason I gave these headphones three stars even though they deserve 5 is because according to Google the headphone manufacturer Sonitum does not exist.  It's a ghost company.  I myself as a consumer like to know who I am getting my products from and what they are about.  Even from product images on the internet I found a box with a website stating 'visit us on Sonitum.net'  Good freaking luck with that.  Last I checked the domain was parked and reserved via 'GoDaddy.com'.  Otherwise excellent product.SPECIFICATIONS:Frequency Response: 20-20000Hz.Speaker Dimension: 40MMSpeaker Impedance: 32 OHMSSensibility:  103+/-3dBCable Length: 1.5mm (4.9ft)Jack: 3.5mm
4,I like
5,My students love the headphones! I use them for center work with the scholars.  They can hear clearly and the noise cancellation is excellent! If needed I would definitely purchase again.  The headphones are excellent quality. You won't be disappointed!
5,Bought these as a staff appreciation gift from the PTSO teachers have been raving about these headphones!
4,I needed some useful headphones that are comfortable and "cool" looking for my students in my classroom.These are the perfect headphones for children.  They are adjustable colorful and comfortable.  I have other headphones my students could use and these are the headphones they always choose first.  I bought 2 sets and if needed will purchase them again.
4,I am using these for my 6th grade students.  They are used daily.  I have had one set for a year and only two have started not working right.  I have gained more students so I ordered another set of these since the first set has worked so well.
5,Super great for the classroom and the kids love that could customize it by choosing their own color. They love new items and everyone sure wanted to have one even if they had one from home. Would highly recommend it to all!
2,I received 30 of these as a request via DonorsChoose for my classroom. I was so excited for my students to use them since the school supplies headsets were so uncomfortable. We only used them about 2-3 times per week and my students were given ‚Äúprivileges‚Äù to use them based on how well they cared for them. Every time they used them they were to carefully hang them on a clothes each that I purchase for them so they weren‚Äôt shoved in a drawer and or desk. This is clearly a quality control issue. The little brackets on the microphone/volume part don‚Äôt stay on and cannot ‚Äúclip‚Äù back together. As if they should‚Äôve been glued. This leaves exposed wires and inoperable microphone/volume. Other than that they are very comfortable and my students liked them a lot but not if they‚Äôre broken. I emailed the company today and told them I either want an upgraded replacement at no charge or headsets without microphones (which kind of defeats the purpose of why I got them in the first place - for testing comfort and ability to access the microphone for the state reading fluency test.
5,Purchased this product for all of my students in 3rd Grade. The students are loving the colors and at the same time the sound quality is really impressive. It is very easy to use with and compatible to our classroom tablets.In general we love this product and highly recommended to all online learners out there. So far there is no issue we encounter on the products. My friends are buying these too after they saw the items. Also I am outstand with the durability of the products.
5,These were  bought for a small class . The sound quality on these are really good especially when you're online talking. Sound is  very clear. Very happy with the headphones and the price. The padding on these is really soft and does help with the noise cancelling feature with these headphones.
5,I purchased 40 of these headphones for my STEAM lab computer classroom.  I used a strong adhesive pad with a zip-tie to secure each pair to a desk (separate purchase).  My students are in 7th grade...and after ~3months of wear and tear from 12 year olds...they have held up and the sound quality is great too.  It's definitely worth it to upgrade to these if you are having trouble with the cheapest headphones on the internet for your classroom lol.  Great customer service too:)
5,These have lasted longer than any other headphones in my classroom and the students love them. Great purchase I plan to buy more!
5,Ordered these headphones for our school's computer lab. They have great sound and have held up well with all of the students using them.
5,These headphones are very durable.  My middle schoolers use them daily and are not the gentlest with them.  They have lasted longer than anything I have bought.  I got these within a couple of days and I plan to order even more next year!
5,Our preschool class uses them frequently. Very durable and great for classrooms. They have lasted a long time.
5,My students love the level of comfort in these headphones. They also have great sound quality and volume! I do use them for kindergarten and the kids can be a bit rough on them. I‚Äôve had a couple kids be too rough to the point where they don‚Äôt work. Overall I love them!
5,We ordered these for a Special Education classroom. The kids loved them and helped cancel out some of the noise from the students around them.
4,Great for the classroom!
4,I brought these for my classroom. I have high school students that are rough headphones. They are great for the classroom. The students love them . I would highly recommend this to my fellow teacher. This is my second time to buy them.
4,I bought these for my classroom and the kids love them! I really like that they fold flat for easy and space saving storage. I definitely recommend these.
5,I am a teacher and I bought these headphones for my classroom. My students love that they are comfortable and have great sound quality. Sophia the owner of Sonitum was super nice and customer service is top notch!  Would purchase again.
5,Bought this for the school I work for. So far all good!
2,I purchased 40 of these and some of them don't work right out of the box. I purchased them last year but didn't use them until this school year so the return window has unfortunately closed. Think twice about these as they may not last very long.
5,We purchased about 90 pairs of these headphones for use with laptops and IPADS in a school.  They have been used by kids from kindergarten through grade 12.  They are sturdy and have exceeded our expectations.
4,These are a much better value per pair than the cheap ones at the stores. They hold up pretty well to the use from my family member with intellectual disabilities
5,I purchased 20 of these headphones for my elementary music students.  These headphones are comfy colorful and the students love them.  So far I have had no issues with sound or breakage and various age levels use them everyday.
5,Bought these for my 4th grade classroom. They are great for student use. I will be buying more in the future.
5,I got tired of the super cheap headphones we use for onboarding new employees so I upgraded to these and they were worth the money. Comfortable Nice Looking and durable!
5,These are comfortable and my students do not complain about wearing them.
5,These headphones were just the right purchase for my kiddos. They loved the color choices the comfort and quality of these headphones.  Thanks!
5,I was looking for headphones that included a mic for our students. These headphones work well and are durable. Can't beat the price.
4,These headphones are a wonderful addition to my classroom listening station. My students are really enjoying them.
5,These headphones are definitely worth the investment. I have found that my students prefer the comfort and design of these headphones compared to others.Love them!
5,They work great! With five kids home when the pandemic hit these were priced in our budget and each child got to get their own color! They still work! We wasted so much money buying cheap ones and until these were still very budget friendly! Highly recommend  getting! They can also handle a beating my three old has draged his around thrown them about. Yet even being "child abused" they have held up surprisingly well!
2,I was very excited to purchase these for my classroom. However they have all stopped working after a few months. The sound is very fuzzy. I'm disappointed and so are my students.
5,We are happy with our purchase! Very good headphones. Our students are very happy with their new headphones. Thank-you so much!
5,I really like these headphones for my students. I have personally tried them and they do everything they say they do they are comfortable the sound is great and cancel noise.
5,I purchased this set of headphones for my classroom. They are perfect! My students loved being able to have different colors to choose from. The headphones are comfortable and have great sound quality. I will definitely purchase again for the upcoming school year.
5,I purchased these headphones to be used in exhibitions. They are sturdy and look sharp. Thus far they have been functioning without any problems. The ear part is soft and cushioned providing pretty good noise blockage from exterior sound. Right out of the box the  head extender feature is a bit stiff but have loosened up as they have been used more.
5,
5,We use these in our kids class and we even donated multiple sets to the school. The teacher has commented on how great they are for noise cancellation sound quality comfort and how they fold down and store nicely. They also have cool colors the kids really like. I will be purchasing again soon to donate to more classes at the school.
5,Classroom use: 6-8th graders. Students find them comfortable. They have lasted thru heavy use/non-delicate care by preteens/teens. A couple have stopped working but that should be expected with the rough handling by the students. The colors make them stand out.I started with 5; bought a different kind that the students didn‚Äôt like; then bought the 10 pack. Well worth the price.
5,I own a computer company and have sold 70 of these headphones so far. Very good quality! Have not had  a single problem with them yet! I highly recommend them!Ruben
5,I bought these for my sons classroom. Several students didn‚Äôt have personal headphones so when I saw how inexpensive this set was I purchased them. They were delivered on time and so far the students are happy. I bought the ones with different colors so the students were able to choose which ones they wanted. Overall the product is great sturdy and inexpensive. I would recommend and purchase these again if I needed too.
5,Used for child care center. Have been holding up well to regular use
3,I bought these for my children of different grades that are homeschooling. They were packaged good wrapped individually in plastic. All but the one pictured were working. The wire was hanging out of the broke one. By the end of the day another pair of headphones broke the wire came out of that one as well. The headphones are comfortable and they do cancel out noice well but they do not seem like they will be durable/sturdy enough for long time use. So in my opinion it‚Äôs not worth the price. I‚Äôve bought headphones from the dollar store and multiple retail stores that were cheaper but didn‚Äôt break as quickly as these did.
5,These headphones were a great alternative to more expensive brands while offering a similar product.  No complaints so far.
5,These headphones are very popular with my kids. They work great and are comfortable. Definitely worth the price!
3,They break where the wires meet. I ought these for a 2nd grade classroom and 5 of 20 have broken. The company was very nice about replacing the broken headphones. I recommend buying extras.
5,I purchased these back in November for my class and they have been great!  None of them have broken and these kids are not always gentle with these headphones.  I'll definitely be purchasing them again!
5,Good price good quality and theachers loves them as well. Perfect for school and home. I'll buy them again if needed
5,Purchased for my child‚Äôs classroom affordable and they loved them. Works as designed.
5,Headphones were just what I needed and just as advertised.  Prompt delivery and good quality product.  We used them for listening stations for video presentations.
5,Bought these headphones in bulk to support my classroom (I have students work online in class) and they have lasted! They have stayed in great shape after being used and cleaned almost daily. Very comfortable and will buy more in the future!
5,I ordered these for my first grade classroom.  The sound is clear and the padding on the headphones is comfortable.  The cord is long so I needed to use a cord tie to keep my students from tripping on it when they carried the iPad around the classroom.  I've been very satisfied.
5,Used in a class of lively 2nd graders. All still work fine after months of use! Very pleased!
5,Loved the head phones and came in cool colors. The kids love them
3,I bought these for each student in my Kindergarten class.  Within a few days of using them some of the kids complained they couldn't hear.  After checking them several times sure enough they weren't working.  It's almost like there is a loose connection in them.  I spent a lot of my own money to get these because most of my students can't afford them and now I'm having to spend more money to purchase something else.
4,Good product for the classroom.
5,Great value comfortable
5,My students love their new cool colored headphones! They also love that they can‚Äôt hear other students working while wearing their headphones! My students are quite the critics when it comes to technology & they give them two thumbs up!!!
5,Teachers these are the way to go kids loved how comfortable they were. My charity organization purchased them and they were a good value for the money
3,These are great and affordable . I was honestly tired of purchasing bulk orders of cheap ear buds for my children and I found these . I have five children who are doing distance learning and these work great ! I can monitor my 3 younger children in the same room  without them interrupting each other . The head phones are durable and fashionable ... They come in 5 different colors which are great for us . I also have a spare headphone for each child .*** Please note that we have only been using these for 1 week . I will update in a month or so ...*** I had to change from 5 stars because in just over one month we only have 1 headphone that is still working and only on the left side. We had 10  pair so for about $3 a pair it was still a much better buy than getting a $10 pair that would only last 3 days .
5,I bought these for use in my Middle School  classroom and they have been great.  They are comfortable and hold up well and the really like them.  All at a good price point!
5,My students love these headphones. We were able to order them with the great price and we were so surprised with the quality. I have students who will wear them for 2 class periods in a row without them hurting. We will definitely buy more when we can.
5,Sound is well balanced and consistent. Headphones are comfortable to wear even for those of us that wear eyeglasses. And although these are not noice canceliing they do a great job blocking external noises.Comes in assorted colors and the price is unbeatable considering their performance and comfort.
5,I teach an after school music club and the kids love their headphones. They like the comfort of it the sound the colors they also like how it folds up flat for storage. They are great quality headphones I'm very happy with this product. Aloha Maui Music Mission! Lahaina Hawaii!
5,These headphones are perfect for my classroom. My students enjoy all the different colors they come in. They are sturdy and made very well. The sound quality is perfect and also helps with noise cancelation. Perfect for my special needs classroom!
5,Perfect for our classrooms
5,We've been using these headphones for our elementary students for three months now. They are working great and holding up to the abuse!
5,Great value and perfect for my classroom
5,These are great headphones to use in my class. They are very comfortable and have good sound.
5,I purchased a pack of 10 headphones for my Media class.  In the past I have purchased other brands that either turn up missing because they are hard to identify or they break.  These are awesome because after about a month or two of heavy use they are still working great and the bright colors make them easy to identify and none have walked away from my classroom yet!I highly recommend these headphones for teachers that need them for their classroom!
5,My class of 3rd graders enjoys these headphones. They find them very comfortable and never complain about sore ears! Great price and quality. Highly recommend!
5,myself and all 3 kids use these headphones - they are fantastic - comfortable - sound is amazing and even more importantly for my kids they look extremely cool!! Easiest 5 star rating - highly recommend!
5,Purchased these for our training lab environment in conjunction with disposable liners. Employees were happy with comfort and quality of headphones with several asking where they were purchased. Will be purchasing more in the future for additional requests for headphones.
5,These are for our students and they work very well!
5,I bought these for my sons first grade classroom about 3 months ago. They still work and his teacher was more than grateful!
5,We purchased these for a classroom at an elementary school. The quality is great especially for the price.
5,My kids are horrible with their headphones and we have been going through them rather quickly. I bought this big pack thinking we would need the extra ones anyway but so far they've been holding up rather well.
5,I have purchased hundreds of student headphones over time for my students. These are durable comfortable and reasonably priced. My students love them.
4,I bought these headphones primarily to listen to conversations interviews and live spoken-word recordings ‚Äì so I can't speak to their fidelity when it comes to someone who takes their music seriously. But for my purposes these headphones did exactly what I wanted: they cut enough ambient sound in the room to make the recorded sounds clearer; they provided a lot more insulation than even a nice set of earbuds; they allowed me to answer calls with a sufficient mike without removing them while working; and they most certainly didn't break the budget.Don't equate price with quality this time around; for the money these headphones are a real workhorse deal.
5,These headphones are very comfortable durable and a great deal for the quality.
5,Work as expected.
5,These were purchased for a couple hundred students. They love the quality and the students take great pride in these headphones.
5,Came promptly the kids in my daughters class love them.  I bought them to donate to class.
5,I have really enjoyed using these headphones in my childcare classroom with my children.
5,I bought these headphones for my class and they are awesome! They are well-built and the kids love the bright colors. They work well to block out sound and they are comfortable. The headphones are great to use during testing as the kids can hear test materials clearly. Will buy again.
5,My students loves these headphones. They are colorful and do a great job. Great quality as well. Would buy again.
4,I purchased these to replace a set of headphones that I recently purchased.  The amazing thing is that they are much better constructed than my previous set while being 1/3 less expensive. My previous set was bluetooth and rechargeable but clearly were not to take the "real world' abuse. The other thing that I noticed was that this set is far more superior in blocking out other noises. The sound is really great. I purchased both pairs to listen to movies streaming on my Fire Tablet and while plugged in I had a much better comfort and quality of sound from my Sonitum Headphones. Really a great product!
1,The little plastic pieces that cover the volume control button on these headphones fall off leaving exposed wires. I purchased these for my 2nd grade classroom and within the first week of school nearly every pair of headphones was broken. Now they are all being held together with electrical tape. Very disappointed in this purchase.
5,We ordered these a few months ago and they are working out well in our school computer lab!
5,I wasn‚Äôt going to spend a lot of money on headphones because my kids are very rough and I knew they wouldn‚Äôt last. But these headphones have definitely surpassed what I thought they are worth every dollar and more!!! Did expect the quality of sound to be good enough to listen to music but again they were Great! Glad I purchased the 10pack! Thank You for such a reasonably priced quality product! Would definitely recommend & would definitely purchase again!üëçüèºüéß‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
2,I purchased a case of these for my 5 year old's kindergarten class.  They dont fit a single child as these are for adult size heads.  They may fit teenagers but not kindergarten or first graders.  Because they don't fit I cannot attest to the sound quality.  These are quite inexpensive so I can only imagine you get what you pay for.
5,My students/6th graders are pleased with the sound quality
5,Ordered these for my classroom and they have been great! They fold nicely for storage and are just perfect for kids. They can easily be wiped off to disinfect but I bought a pair for EACH student so no one had to share! This teacher is thankful for this product! I do not think people realize how many things that are absolutely necessary are not provided for students.
5,Delivered on time and they are perfect for our needs
5,Bought these for my daughter in law‚Äôs kindergarten classAnd there are awesomeGreat price!Thank you!!!!
5,Excellent sound.  They fit your ears...BOTH OF THEM.  Say your ears are not even according to every headphone set I have ever had.  You can have one ear up higher or lower...makes no difference.  You would be surprised how you have just gotten to expect it and just moved on...these are a perfect fit no matter how your ears sit on your head.  The cord that plugs in is not that thin plastic coated wire...Its thick and woven tightly...like cordage on power tools...not thin fabric not heavy and not cold.  Easy to move out of the way.  I just love these...just put them on and forget that you have them on.
5,They was nice for my kids Virtual learning the school gave Crome books but one of them did fit idk why? But it‚Äôs not the seller fault. And after I purchased the seller was really nice. I only gave it a 4 stars because I didn‚Äôt personally use them but when I call my kids name they don‚Äôt hear me. Even my 1 year old they fit I will definitely buy again
4,For the price we paid (less than $4.00/pair) these are phenomenal. We have 4 kids and they lose/break/abuse headphones like crazy. With a ten pack we can keep everyone rocking out and have extras to spare in contingencies. Great value.
4,With a variety of colors it is easy to keep up with whos is who's . Light weight but sturdy.  Have worn for up to 2 hours at a time.
5,These were a great purchase for our school. Would buy again!
5,Product seems well made particularly at this price point. They function as expected. I have no issues with the sound though I only do serious listening through high quality speakers.  The built-in microphone in our Chromebook yields a speakerphone type of sound. The microphone in this headset is a definite improvement. Comfort seems more than acceptable but I have not wore them for an extended period of time. Overall they exceeded my expectation. At this point I am satisfied. In my experience it seems like products of this type in this price range tend to not have extended lifespans. At this time I have no opinion regarding the longevity of this particular product.
5,Great for use with elementary students! Good price and good sound quality!
5,These headphones were delivered on time and they are great quality.  The kids love them especially because they are colorful and it is easy for them to know which set is theirs.  Great all around.
5,Durable
5,I bought 10 of these for my wife's class room the kids love them.
1,I think the headphones are a perfect size for any age head. I can wear them comfortably and so can my 20 kindergartners. I also think the sound was great.. hence - was.I ordered these for daily use back in February. Many of my students can‚Äôt afford to buy headphones so I thought this was the best deal for a pack of 10!Well I started having a lot of trouble with these headphones. I emailed the company about a month ago and they said they would send a replacement order. I haven‚Äôt heard anything since then. When I emailed the company 3 headphones didn‚Äôt work at all and 2 only had sound coming from one side.In that MONTH I now have 6 completely done and 2 that still only have sound coming from one side. That is 8 out of the 10 headphones that have broke in the 4 months of use February-May.Also I was the only one to plug or unplug the headphones from the computer or iPad. My students simply put them on their head and took them off. This still didn‚Äôt prevent them from breaking.I would not purchase these ever again. Spend more money and get a better quality item!
4,Great headphones for the price. Needed them for work Zoom calls. Cancels most of the outside noice nicely good sound and microphone works great (co-workers had no problem hearing me). Would recommend for anyone needing a decent set of headphones.
4,Purchased these for my grandkids to use with games and such. They loved them. I was pleasantly surprised how well they sound. Fun colors will probably get more soon
5,They are sturdy and well made. Hopefully will last for a few years. Thanks
5,If you are looking for a basic inexpensive headphone that has good sound and dampens the noise around you this is a great one.  I use it to listen to things while in my office at work and the voices around the office are usually reduced to a low muffle.  The sound is very clear.  My only complaint is that I have a little larger than average head so wearing them for a long period (more than a couple hours) can be a little uncomfortable as it is a little tight for me.  I imagine the average person that would be less of an issue.  For the price it is one of the best I have found!
4,For the price the sound quality is very good. I've tried several head sets and ear buds at prices much higher than this that didn't have the sound quality.  However after about an hour of wearing these headphones my ears hurt. I think I've read that you can get some kind of padding to help with that but assume it might also muffle the great quality.  Everybody's ears are different so this problem might not bother you.
5,These are the best headphones for my needs so far. I must have gone through three or four sets of headphones in the last 18 months or so. I was looking for something that I could wear for a long time without it chafing against my ears. Also I'm pretty tough on headphones and my last few sets ended up breaking. So far I am not disappointed with this purchase. The headphones are very comfortable sound great and most of all are built very well and hold up to extended use. In fact I may purchase another set. One for home and one for my backpaxk so that I always have one available. Thank you for an excellent product!
5,Pleased with purchase.
5,We love these headphones for the classroom!  So far they are very sturdy and working well with my younger students.  The cable is braided and thicker and they are lightweight.  They do not have volume control; but that can be controlled on the device so I actually love that.  I used to have students complain that headphones were not working only to discover that the volume dial had been turned down.  The noise cancellation is also superior to other brands so I do have to go around and tap everyone on the shoulder when it's time to clean up:)
5,9 grand kids‚Ä¶ho ho ho
5,I love this product!
5,I purchased 20 of these headphones for my students and they are wonderful! They have held up great and look cute too. The kids loved the variety of different colors and how comfortable they were. I would definitely recommend these for virtual learning and classroom use.
5,my children go through headphones so fast i really should buy stock in a company. these are great no complaints from my kids during a 24 hour road trip. and getting 10 at once amazing! they can't complain much if they all have the very same headphones!
5,First of all they are more comfortable than other headphones that I have had. It is like my ears are enclosed in memory foam. The sound is really good. I cannot believe that these were inexpensively priced so well.They are made for people with smallish heads...  If you are a big 6'2" linebacker these may be too small for you.All in all I am very pleased.
5,I needed some earphones with a microphone in it. They are very comfortable and served my needs. I was in a hurry but got some help from Amazon and was able to get these to go with my Kindle. I had a writing workshop hosted on Zoom and was worried I wouldn't know how to do all this. It worked out fine and am now confident to do things like that in the future.
3,I wanted an inexpensive set of headphones that would work decently as the speaker on my phone was not working well. These improved the sound so much and telephone conversations now a breeze with them on - the microphone works very well.  Actually they are five star for the price range; they don‚Äôt have the deep bass of a more expensive pair  but they are fine for the majority of users.  ADDENDUM: I change my review from a five-star to a three star after over a month of use. The jack connection which at first I was happy with is very loose . The sound goes in and out when you leave it on most of the time as I do.  Other than that the rest of the review still holds .
4,Bought these for our school. Work well so far.
5,I like this product the most is it can fold it up and able to store it nicely and save a lot of spaces and all the wires were not tangle.  My students also love the colors!
5,These are perfect for my classroom. They Erik great for my students and the kids love them.
5,This was an absolutely good deal it was very effective for my family members for their online learning. They noise cancellation feature help greatly as they weren‚Äôt able to disturb each other........an overall good deal for such good quality headphones and colors.
5,I bought these for my third grade classroom. My students have used them everyday for the last six weeks. So far they have stood up to the use and abuse of children. They love the look of them and they say that they are comfortable.
5,These are extremely comfortable and fits adults easily. They are comfortable and can be worn for long stretches. The cord is nice and sturdy as well as the headphones all together. Love the sound quality they are nice and loud at low volume and the sound quality is amazing. 100% worth the buy. I love the single cord design which makes it tangle free. This is by far my favorite set of headphones I've ever owned. Great product and great manufacturer.
5,Great headphones.  Bought a couple boxes of them for a donation to my daughter's 2nd grade class for use with their tablets.  Her teacher said they work well and meet their needs.
5,Ok these aren't expensive super high quality headphones.  I got them for my son for Christmas who mostly uses them to listen to videos on his laptop so he doesn't disturb his college roommate.  He thinks they are great for his purposes.  They fit great and he says the sound quality is good.  If you are looking for DJ quality professional level headphones look at the more expensive ones.  If you're looking for quality headphones that won't break the bank these will work just fine.
2,There is only about 2" by 1" of foam in a small circle more to fit a child's ear on the ear piece. The head band is not flexible at all it is hard plastic I nearly snapped the first pair trying to get them on.The nice thing about them is the flat lined old telephone cable they have for a chord.
5,I am well pleased with these headphones. I do a lot of coursework online and living with a noisy family that loves to blast the tv makes it difficult to concentrate. I got these hoping that I could at least filter out some of the noise. I am extremely happy with the results. I am able to listen to either study music or nature/rain/thunderstorms without the excess noise from the main living areas. I did not think it was possible. Thank you!
5,Great noise cancellation comfortable high quality. Very pleased
5,Our students are loving these headphones they like the sound quality the cords are long enough to extend while using desktop computers. The sounds are captured in the headphones provides a distraction free environment. Fits from kids to adults.
5,I am very impressed with these headphones for the following reasons -1. Very solid bass but not at the expense of the other tonal ranges.2. I am very pleased with the woven fabric cord.  It does not tangle and it is not so long that it is annoying.  Length just right for me.3. I like the way these headphones fold up.  Very convenient.
5,As I wear hearing aids I cannot use ear buds.  This item works great for me.  It is good on noise cancellation.  I can still hear that something is going on but there is not enough to bother me.  Sound quality is excellent.  Adjusting the headphones are easily done.  They are not cumbersome as they fold easily and are comfortable to wear.  Definitely good if you wear hearing aids.
5,Our students really enjoyed using the headphones.  We had others but they were constantly playing with them adjusting them trying to keep them on.These are great.
5,These are great headphones.  Noise cancelling enough but not too much to where students can't hear you.  That's a plus.  The kids love the colors and say they're comfortable.  Would recommend!
5,With all of this work from home and video conferences I purchased these for my high number of virtual meetings. They're very good. Great sound quality and microphone works well. The seller also packaged and sent them quickly with no issues.
5,The students like the headphones. It helps them concentrate. They are comfortable and definitely work at keeping noise out.
4,Bought it for my special needs son he didn't like it without a good reason (maybe because the thick cord which is precisely what I like/sturdy) but my wife got it uses it and likes it a lot.
5,purchased these for the our office class room and the kids love them  great sound  comfortable and good price
5,These head phones compare with what most stores sell for $30 - $50. I bought these to use in my office and listen to them for hours a day. I am very happy with these. I've bought headphones for twice as much money and where half as good as these. They are not premium but definitely mid-tier. These headphones exceeded my expectations.
4,I like the quality of the sound but after about an hour or so they feel really tight on my head and hurt my ears. They are still a good value for the money.
4,good sound fit comfort and mic works good and is clear
5,I love these headphones. I use them at work because sometimes it gets a little loud and if I am on a skype with someone they cut out a lot of the back ground noise. I also listen to music at work and they are great. I would recommend these and if something ever happens to them I would buy them again.
3,Sound quality starts off pretty good but then you hear absolutely nothing. Not sure if the wires burn out fast but 6 out of 10 pairs we've used so far have had this issue. I purchased the 10 pack bundle.
5,I really love the quality of the sound for the price I paid! I have had it for more than a month now and it is still as good as when I unboxed it. Sound quality for calls is great too! The only problem for me is when I am trying to lay down and listen to music with it it doesn't work otherwise great product! Loving it.
5,These are terrific headphones for the price.  The sound quality is good and the fit is exceptional. They are very comfortable to wear. I was a little worried when I ordered them because the description sounded like they were made for children but that is not the case at all. They fit me very well and can be adjusted in a variety of ways.
5,I bought these for my first graders to use on their chromebooks! They love them and they work great! Thanks!
5,Purchased for student use during remote learning.  Kids like to use them.  Product shipped quick and met our needs.
5,Wear all day with hardly any problems. Has a good sound for the price. Cord is a nice material a bit short for PC use but a simple 3.5 mm extension works. Just plug in and works fine.
5,These are perfect for my 2nd graders. My students said they are very comfortable and they love the colors.
5,Headphone connected easily to my sound system. They are comfortable and produce good sound quality. I would recommend these head phones for anyone who needs a reasonably priced good quality head phone. I work from home and attend many webinars. I can listen without disrupting the rest of the household.  I also use them to listen to music in the evening.  The sound quality is very good!
5,I love these. I wear them about 12 hours a day while getting all my work done. I forget they are even on. The button allowing the pause and play has been extremely helpful.
5,My school age Children love these headphones. Great for use I'll be taking them on a trip tomorrow morning.üòä
5,I bought these for myself to listen to Netflix on my iPad. I was really impressed with the sound quality since they were inexpensive.  I felt like I was sitting in the theater.  I have a small head and they fit fine. I had my husband try them and they fit him also so I bought a second pair for him.
5,Our SpEd Department uses these headphones and all of the students have adjusted to them quickly.
5,Purchased 30 of these and donated to a gradeschool. Good reviews from the school.  Good quality and a great price
5,I got these headphones for a trip I was taking in March. The sound quality is great and they are really comfortable. They are durable also because my grand kids use them with their I pads and they still work perfectly. A great buy for the money I will definitely look for this company when I get another pair.
4,My son loves these but he says they were a bit uncomfortable at first. His older pair had become very stretched. He would have liked a volume control button on the cord. Other than that he really likes them.
5,I bought this headphone so I could listen to audio books on my kindle on the way to work. The sound quality is very goodcancels out the road noise and it is very comfortable. The headphones are adjustable to fit any size person. These are perfect for my situation.
4,I really enjoy the sound quality and the comfort of the headphones! The cord is also a very nice touch as it‚Äôs incredibly durable and doesn‚Äôt tangle easily. Definitely worth the buy :) Very worth the price
5,For the price these absolutely do the job and more. I was very surprised at the quality considering the low cost of the item. I‚Äôve had no issues with breakage or losing sound quality and I use the headphones for hours a day at work. A product I would happily buy again even if something went wrong with my current model.
5,I primarily use these with my laptop to watch youtube. They are great for this and sometimes i forget I've got them on. They fit comfortable and I am no longer the Audiophile I used to be but for the price they are an excellent choice. I recently used a pair of very expensive headphones and could tell very little difference.
3,I used these headphones for my laptop the sound is good but I had problems with the head set.  One one of the ear prices wouldn‚Äôt stay on.  And tonight I found out the reason it was broken.
3,The product is constructed well plugs into my computer okay and the sound quality is fine. I use the headset for study purposes in a room next to the television and outside noise cancellation is okay. My only complaint is the 'small' size of the padded ear muffs. Their size would be adequate for a small child but following a few minutes use my adult ears become sore from use. And no I don't have unusually large ears.
2,I have had two kids come up with a broken headset already - neither were crazy with them. The casing for the little button on the cords just popped off. Both within the first two weeks of usage.(I have 15 3rd grade students)
3,The students complained about the comfort of the headphones. Within the first week a couple pairs of the headphones needed replacing due to sound not working.
4,The sound quality of these headphones is just as good or even better than some of the higher end headphones that I have used in the past. You can‚Äôt beat this set at this price.
5,Extremely pleased! I am a teacher and these are perfect for my classroom!
4,Much better than I expected for the price. Would give 5 starts but was hoping they'd fold up a little flatter for air travel.
4,I've got several different brands but my teenage daughter love these! Good enough for everyday music on the way while she walks to school; and works fine with her computer.
5,Bought for my son it works good and he uses it daily.  As for robustness time will tell.  For now it works I do on occasion have to tell him to turn it down because I can sometimes hear the music on his headphones which means hes got it turned up loud.
5,This pair of headphones are by far the best purchase at that price point that I have ever made on Amazon.I've had headphones that cost three time this price and we junk.noise reduction sound fit all 5 star.I love how they tighten to your head. Quality!
4,Weren't expecting gold when we ordered these and glad we weren't. They do the job but have basic issues you expect with cheap headphones.
3,Already had to throw  away three because no sound was coming through
1,I bought these headphones as a classroom set. They were great headphones however unfortunately within two weeks of use in a 4th grade classroom 2 out of the 10 have already broken in the microphone part. I am very disappointed as I hoped they would last at least the rest of the school year. I hope the rest make it :(
5,These headphones are perfect for little ones.  They are simple to use and durable.
3,I used these for my daycare children for their virtual classroom and they were easily broken by 5-10 year old children.
5,These little foldable headphones are great to wear & hear sounds clearly. They seem durable so far but w/ time we shall see. I like the size of the ear part as it fits perfectly. They are smaller than my last pair from another vendor but they broke w/in a  couple months.
1,These are awesome until they're not. One by one these things just stopped working. We ordered them March 5 2022 and it's now April 30 2022 and not one of them works. And they haven't worked for weeks. Do not buy these!!!!
5,Used for students in a classroom setting
5,I got these for my son. His dad gets him all kinds of headphones & they always seem to break -could be the users fault! Lol No complaints from him on these & he‚Äôs a teenager so I would of heard something with all the different ones he‚Äôs had.
5,My nephews and nieces love these headphones with multiple colors and the sound is clear.
5,They work great with my new Fire 7 Tablet.  They are very comfortable and I have worn them for long periods of time.  Sound is great.  I would recommend these if you're looking for an inexpensive pair of stereo headphones.
5,Excellent headphones for student working with online curriculum! Very comfortable and excellent fit!
5,I bought thesr for my kids. They are comfortable and nice quality.
5,My boyfriend uses these to watch movies on his iPad.  Now we can stay in the same room because of his hearing loss his volume was always way up.  Great solution!  And he says they are comfortable as well.
4,Great sound
4,Good
4,I like it is. Very  comfortable  Wii  buy again
4,Exactly what I was looking for at a great price
2,These headphones are mediocre and flimsy.
5,These worked great for my kids and are still going strong. great product
5,We very happy with our purchase. We went through 4 pairs of headphones before these each set breaking within days. Not only have these held up but they store nicely are comfortable to wear and have great sound quality.
5,It's great -- very nice build quality comfort and sound. Our teen daughter loves it. She did manage to break or cut the plastic cover of one of the wires when stuffing into her backpack but it still sounds fine.
5,I love these headphones. Besides being inexpensive the sound is great and they are comfortable. I listen to pod cast news every night sometimes for hours and these do not bother in ears like many others in the past i have used.
5,So far very happy with quality comfort & sound of these!! :D shipped quick!
5,These are amazing at the price! So clear and smooth. Great sound. Love the durable cord. Only thing is there is no volume up or down button. If they change this feature these headphones would be perfect aligned with the greats**
5,I got the headphones very quickly. They worked well with my iphone and have a nice long cord. They fold up nicely and so far have seemed durable. They adjust easily to different sized heads. The sound quality is excellent.
5,These headphones are very comfortable it has a  decent sound quality for the price I also must add that the build quality is very good for the price you payThe Comfort level is very good for someone who listens to music long time
4,It‚Äôs cheaper but doesn‚Äôt perform as such. Better quality than you‚Äôd expect.
5,They seem pretty decent so far. The sound quality is good the mic works and they seem sturdy. I may update this based on how long they last later but for now they are pretty good.
5,For the price these are exceptional headphones. They sound great and are very comfortable. I would absolutely recommend these! This is my second purchase - for one of the kids - as mine have stood the test of time!
5,These are really nice headphones for the money!  Excellent value!  Comfortable covers the ear but does not cover over the ear.  Very good sound quality.  Very good product build quality.
5,Loved them.  Using them for my kids online classes.
5,These headphones are used for listening to the radio while going to sleep.  They have not broken considering they sometimes get rolled onto.  They have great sound quality and were a great buy.
5,Very comfortable and the sound is great.  I love them.
1,Read some of the other reviews. These were great for all of week one in my classroom. I ended up buying more along with an extended warranty on them. Unfortunately they were almost all broken half working within 2-3 weeks. My kids weren't rough with them and put them back into bags after using them every time. (4th grade) No money back and even worse the warranty wouldn't go through because they were so new. IT WAS A WASTE. If you are a teacher keep looking because these are not the headphones for you.
5,These headphones are comfortable sound great made well and are affordable. I use them daily with my phone Walkman CD and cassette players. I couldn't be more satisfied. I would definitely recommend them.
5,For the price paid these can't be beat!  The noise cancellation isn't the greatest but for the price these headphones are great.  I would definitely recommend them.  Very happy with this purchase
5,These headphones are affordable comfortable and function well. I have 3 pairs - one for my son my husband and me. We all find them to work great for us.
4,sounds great and feels great!
5,My husband uses these to watch videos on his smartphone.  He likes the fact that he can fold them up and wrap the cord around them.  They are comfortable as well.
4,Size
5,I use this on a HP laptop. Works excellent. Very surprised for such a price. Will recommend them. Fits my size 7 3/4 head perfect. Lot of adjustment room. Thank You
5,Works perfectly. Autistic child listens on them or just leaves them on with no sounds on to block out other noise.Still work 3 months later with a ruff child messing with them!
5,Love the feel and the sound.  Sometimes feel tight when I have my glasses on.
5,I almost passed these up because they are priced so low!  Good sound quality and they are very comfortable.  I bought these for work and I couldn't be happier.
5,I bought these for me but they were too small for my ears....gave them to my wife and she loves them! Very good quality for the price. I recommend them to everyone.
5,I needed a quieter head set and this one is quieter than the one I was using but does not completely cancel noises. It does have great music sound.
5,These are very comfortable even after you had worn them for a while. The sound quality is excellent and for the price you get a great product at an affordable price.
5,I wanted a pair of headphones that didn't envelop my ears and these were great. I have a larger head and these are not tight at all which is good.
5,Amazing product. Would definitely recommend to any person who is looking for a pair of headphones.Lasts long and definitely worth the money and it‚Äôs really cheap for such good quality
5,For the price these headphones are a terrific buy!  My autistic son wears headphones constantly while working on the computer and we also carry the headphones everywhere!  Terrific product!
5,Arrived within 36 hours. Some of the beat headphones ive bought for the price. And they have a mic that also works great and works for my Xbox one.
5,Finally a very good quality headset for the small cost that actually works well with my Fire tablet! So happy with this purchase! Comfortable and a pleasure to use. Thanks!
5,Good product.  No issues. My son uses them for his ipad which has been a perfect fit for us. Adjusts great volume is great.  Great price.
5,Sounds  good to me.
5,Very comfortable.  Compact size exactly as I wanted.  Not flimsy.  Easily packs in my computer bag for use in noisy locations.  Sound quality excellent.
3,Ok for kids
5,I am using it for my keyboard for some reason it only works when i plug it in halfway.The sound is very clear it's very comfortable!
5,Use for homeschool computer work.  The noise cancelling and comfort is very important for our ADHD student.
5,We have only used them two times so far but they are very comfortable and work very well.
5,Got this for my hubby to wear when watching TV.  He LOVES them and he looks cute in them too!
5,Bought these for our toddler and they work great! Adjustable fit is very helpful. He doesn‚Äôt complain. I tried them and the sound is great quality.
5,I needed a pair of inexpensive yet functional headphones for work. I don't wear them all day so they are perfect for the price!
4,Good quality
5,These earphones are very well made and the sound is great. They are sturdy yet light. And with the price this is a great find.
5,Great headphones. I highly recommend!!!
1,These headphones are suitable only if you're on the distinctly smaller side of average. I know they're a cheap set but even so... The bottom of the earpiece yes I have them on MAXIMUM extension reaches about halfway down my ear and the diameter of the earpiece is at most two-thirds the size of my previous set of headphones (and I didn't pay much for those either!) It's no wonder the manufacturers don't give you any measurements. The only thing to be said for them is that they're cheap enough for me to just write them off. Now to go start posting requests for actual sizes on some other sets of headphones. I can't rate the noise cancellation or sound quality for obvious reasons.
4,A OK
5,Very high quality for the price. Comfortable padding and fit and very sturdy.  Sound quality is excellent.  Highly Recommend this product.
5,I use the headphones specifically for listening to downloadable books from the library but will use with myphone for music as well.
4,Good sound
5,I‚Äôm really enjoying my music listening with these headphones. The sound is clear the headphones are comfortable and sooo much better than earbuds.
2,We LOVED these headphones but they stopped working this week.  It's been about 1.5 years and they just stopped working one day.  If you play around with the wire a lot they will work for a second and then when you let go they stop.  Disappointed because we really liked these.
5,Teenager-approved.Bought for my son.Preferred over a second set purchased from another seller.More durable. Better sound quality and better build.
1,I bought these for 2nd graders. The wires separated on all units within the first week. Once I repaired it they seem to find more ways to fall apart. Eventually all but two units went to the trash. Lousy build.
5,My husband and my 100 year old mother can listen to books on tape with their hearing aids in. Excellent product.
5,na
5,These were for my daughter since she dislikes earbuds. she enjoys the flexibility of the earmuffs and the overall sound.
5,Sound is great but wish they didnt fit quite as tight on my ears. They actually hurt after a short bit.
5,Brought these headphones for my husband to use with his laptop. They fit well and have a great sound. Would buy again.
4,Buy them for prizes for work and the teens love them. You could tell the quality of the material. There are never issues with the order and the items received. The design is sleek and they are comfortable to wear.
5,I loved this headphone I bought one and it was so good for the price I bought again for Christmas. Thanks üôèüèª
5,My first grader needed headphones for school and these have been perfect!!!  Great price!
5,These headphones are great!  One of the best I every used!!  We are ordering another pair ASAPNikki
3,It‚Äôs great for not hearing outside noises but said it came with microphone but it didn‚Äôt :(
5,I love the fact that it folds up so nicely! Great sound quality as well! I would definitely recommend this product.
5,These headphones work great especially for the price. They are much better than expected and very comfortable.
3,I got these specifically for the microphone use. Unfortunately the mic cuts out. I‚Äôll have to find a different set.
1,Edit: I changed my mind. 1 pair arrived broken. 3 pairs stopped working on 1 side within the 1st month and 2 pairs completely stopped working in the first month. Now 60 days later I have 1 working pair and 3 pairs that only work on 1 side. The rest all completely stopped working :(These are perfect! We are doing distancing learning at home this year so I bought these for my boys and some of the neighborhood kids. They comfortably fit the kindergarten children as well as me. Great product for the price.
5,I ordered these for my music class( piano)  they are very comfortable and do the job :)
3,Mids are OK highs are meh and bass is good for a cheap pair of headphones without drowning everything else out.
5,These were extremely nice and comfortable the noise cancellation worked great very good sound and very durable.
5,Excellent affordable headset......equal to costly headsets we've purchased in the past
3,My grandson said they didn‚Äôt work the sound
5,Just what I was looking for. Comfortable and good sound quality that blocks other room noise.
5,love it as I hate ear buds fits perfect and not large as some I have used. perfect.
3,these are aright - a step up from ear buds.......  maybe........  the cord is nice.
5,Can't beat the sound for the price.No indication of left and right on earphones.
5,Noise cancellation is awesome. Watch movies on my kindle while wife driving and I am gone. Perfect
1,Comfortable seemed ok at first but just falling apart cord coming out of source from just very little use
5,I purchased these headphones for my granddaughter after reading the reviews. She absolutely loves them. No complaints.
5,Fine headphones especially for the cost and very compact. As well as quite comfortable!
5,Love love this me and my daughter can‚Äôt stop wearing them I got a pair also
1,I purchased these for my kindergarten class and I am really surprised and disappointed that half of them are already not working properly and the children cannot hear their tablets. This was an investment to last through some classes but half have only lasted weeks.  I hope the company can make this better for us and I will update my review accordingly.
5,The price was very good for this quality. You've done well. Thank you.
2,Purchased these for my son. Lasted two days. Not very durable
5,I‚Äôm very happy with these headphones. They sound great. Wonderful quality for a good price.
5,Worked with android tablets - adjustable and comfortable at a great price
5,Use while in class to cancel noise
5,The devise is comfortable on the ears with a very good noise cancellation effect.
5,These have a good sound and are a great value at this price point.
1,Two of these headphones broke on the second day my class used them. The ends to the headphone's jack broke off. I dont expect the rest to last long. Im very disappointed dont waste your money.
5,Use these on the computer and tablet they work great. Very clear sounding.
5,They fit well. I like that cable is only on one side.
5,Really good sound can hear sound nuances now and light weight !!
3,All of the pieces didn't come with the item
1,Several pairs of these ‚Äúpremium‚Äù headphones shorted out after a few months of use. For the extra price you don‚Äôt get much more use out of them than the cheaper ones.
1,Purchased 2 sets of these headphones for my virtual learning center.  After a few weeks the headphones stopped working.  Not just 1 pair all of them. They first start off with a shortage and then they would stop working all together.  What a pile of junk!
5,The headphones are very comfortable and I would recommend to purchase
5,I use them to listen to music on my cd player
5,Perfect headphones and very comfort for bingeing on podcasts.
3,Hurts my ears and lacks quality
5,It was affordable and good quality.
5,sounds pretty good for a low price headphone set
5,used for listening music on the iPad & iPhone
5,My daughter loves them and they work great for school!
5,Sound is very good for a reasonable priced head phone.
5,Headphones are comfortable and and easy to use.
5,Very durable
4,Before I let my class even touch these we talked about how to use them repeatedly we practiced putting them on and putting them away blah blah blah. Ok so they headphones themselves are awesome. They cancel out noise have fantastic sound and are comfortable. The microphone part though‚Ä¶omg every single one was destroyed. I bought these with my own money naturally I tried to salvage them with electrical tape on the shredded mics but that led to only one side working or  not working at all. I don‚Äôt know if it was just my class being rough with them or if they‚Äôre flimsy but keep that in mind when buying these with mics. If I had money to buy more I‚Äôd get some again without the mics because they really are great headphones.
5,Great quality and a very low cost
5,Worked perfectly with my Rosetta Stone
5,They work well and get the job done!
5,Excellent sound from my Galaxy tab A.
5,The product in the nation
5,It was for my mom she loved it
5,Pretty good sound quality for the price.
5,Good sound and quality price. Very satisfied.
5,Great item for a good price.
5,Great for the money
5,good as expected
5,Well made comfortable and priced well!
2,I am dissapointed with these headphones. The mute button stopped working after a week.  And there is no way to control the volume through the headphones.  I am sorry that I purchased these.
5,work great  thankyou!
5,These headphones are very attractive and colorful. The cords haven't gotten tangled like some of the other sets we have had. The seem to be made of a stronger thicker material. The major problem we have had over the years is the structure between the two earpieces breaking. These headphones have held up with 0 breaking in the last couple of years. I will definitely buy this product again when the time comes.
5,Excellent headphones will buy again
5,Son loves it
2,I am only to have these on for 20 minutes as a time before they start to bother my ears. They are not comfortable at all but for $10 what can you expect?
5,Comfortable to wear. Great sound quality.
5,wonderful headphones!
5,I teach kindergarten. My students go on the computer every single day. So headphones are really important to be durable and long lasting. I found these and decided to get them. I really love the quality of the headphones. Because I teach five and six-year-olds they get tossed around thrown on the floor and I have not had one break yet. I would definitely recommend these if you are a teacher a small kids.
5,I have purchased 2 sets of these for my classroom.  They are a great product.  Students report that they are a good fit and the voice dictation piece works great! I would highly recommend this product especially for the price point.
5,Worked nice
5,excellent product
1,The microphone component broke apart the first time these were put on by students. Waste of money‚Ä¶don‚Äôt buy!
2,Music plays very wellVoices are virtually impossible to hear even with sound on maxConfused by how this could beWill probably buy a new set somewhere
5,My kids love them so much they use them everywhere. I haven't heard my kids complain about them yet.
5,GREAT HEADPHONES NICE INVESTMENT!
5,I run a music studio club for 8-13y/o and I need durable headphones that also sound adequate. I‚Äôm impressed with the sound of these headphones and so far they hold up real well with the wear and tear of my young students. Five stars!
5,Love it
2,The pair was way too small for my ears and is too tight for any adult head. Sound quality is very good but the microphone made me sound too clouded.
5,Amazing headphones for the classroom. They are durable and easily cleaned and reused for students. I have a set for extras and students all love the bright colors.
5,Love them.
1,I‚Äôm returning these. Three of them broke the first time they were used.
5,Wonderful sound!
5,Good
1,Even with the protection plan it has been impossible to get them fixed/replaced.  Don't waste your money.
1,I have a slightly above average head and this headphone is just too small for me. Small and uncomfortable to wear that I think this would be better suited for a child. Sound quality is also pretty average. You definitely get what you pay for.
5,This a great product. My children loved using them during homeschool lessons. Each color made it clear which set belonged to which of my 3 kids. These are a quality product.
1,Bought 3 months ago.  Clamp pulled out of right ear piece.  It clamps on head too tight to use very long.  No adjustment possible.  Also sound was too boom-ey for use with iPhone.
1,I bought these headphones for my kids for distant learning But they complains its hurting their ears!!!
5,When I ordered these headphones I was expecting that anything was better than the cheap disposable library ones. I was not disappointed! They came in a variety of colors with individual packaging. The compacting style is useful for easy storage as the side ear pieces turn to 180 degrees for foldable stackable storage. My students used these during testing and have used these to listen to music. Neither time could I hear sounds bleeding through. The students thought they were comfortable and have good sound quality. I would recommend purchasing a class set!-8th grade teacher
1,Listed as bulk pack but was only one.
1,6 out of the 10 did not work
1,I ordered the 10 pack and received one.
5,In receiving these headphone for our school I would highly recommend. The headphones are of great quality and the teachers here love them. We are looking to purchase more in the upcoming school year. The teachers had no complaints. We McCluer North School highly recommend these headphones.
1,I didn‚Äôt receive what was advertised
1,The microphone did not work
1,Should of returned it
5,I bought 35 of these headphones so I would have a class set. After years of having to replace earbuds every few months these have been a dream. The sound quality is good the headphones are comfortable and - most importantly to me as a teacher - they hold up to repeated use by students who aren't always the most careful with my supplies.
1,Stop working right when the return window closed.
1,The mic doesn't work
5,I really like these headphones!! The ones I‚Äôve gotten in the past were really dinky and didn‚Äôt last no more than a month. I‚Äôve only had ONE headphone break (due to a student not taking care of it). If I could have a lifetime supply of these headphones that would be so great!! Great quality headphones!!
1,They work great while they last
5,I ordered these headphones for use with my class.  They have really enjoyed using them.  We have been using them for a month and I have had no problems with them.  I work with 6th graders who are sometimes hard on headphones.  I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend them to others.
5,I put these on my "donors choose" list for my classroom.  They fulfilled my request and the headphones are the best ever.  They are solidly made and the cords don't get entangled like some cheap headphones.  I would highly recommend it.  I am a 2nd-grade teacher.
5,I purchased these to use in my classroom and they have held up wonderfully. Great product!
5,Excellent headphones
5,I ordered these for a teacher friend of mine who needed headphones for students that struggled with using earbuds. She received them promptly and says that they work perfectly and her students love them. Thanks for making such a quality product!
5,Works great with my Prekindergarten students.  Small enough and tight enough for them.  I can use them on my own head too.
5,I am a teacher and my students love these headphones. They stack nicely and are very highly quality. Very awesome investment I would purchase them again.
5,I bought these for my students and they love them! The colors are bright and no matter what color they received they were happy. They are very durable for little kids!!
5,I am very happy with our purchase. We ordered the sets of 10 for our classroom use. We have used them for a couple of months and they are holding up well. The kids enjoy them because they help block out some of the sounds/distractions in the classroom.
5,Love that they are different colors. The kids love and it‚Äôs easy for us to differentiate whose is whose. Great price for the set. Works great with their tablets and chrome books during schooling from home due to COVID.
5,I ordered the 5 pack of headphones for my grandchildren for Christmas.  I tried each pair before wrapping them.  These are very nice headphones with great sound quality comfort and noise cancellation.  The kids all love them and use them with all their electronic devices and to do their school work on their laptops.  I recommend this product.
4,This is only a $14 pair of head phones so you cant expect much from these you do get what you paid for but for the price they are they are great. The sound quality is pretty good as well as the mic. They do feel a bit cheap but that cause they are.
4,I am extremely hard of hearing and these allow me to turn the sound on the television up to make listening comfortable for me without blasting the rest of the family out with the high sound I require to enjoy television watching. The best part of wearing them is that they are so comfortable that lengthy listening is enjoyable.
5,I bought these for my granddaughters since their parents opt in for distance learning they are 5 and 4 years old it fit their heads perfectly.Very easy to connect they use a standard  3.5mm jack.Very versatile also they can be use on any device tablets Android smartphones laptop etc...They wear them the entire school day and the cushions are perfect they are also good when you're traveling connected to the tablets.Great quality and value you get 5 in the package all 5 different vibrant and beautiful colors so you have spares.Overall very happy with my purchase they‚Äôre adjustable and didn‚Äôt hurt their ears even during several hours of use.Highly recommended.
4,The sound is great...light material so I don‚Äôt feel no pressure on the head...no need high volume to hear details or specific instruments... low price... only issue is that at medium volume everyone will be able to hear what you are listening in a quiet room like library
4,Bought this as an extra headset for digital piano. Very comfortable fit although the I prefer a cord that I can sling over my back to get it out of the way. Overall a good product for the money.
4,If you‚Äôre looking for a headset that‚Äôs super comfy these are it. They aren‚Äôt overly huge and they don‚Äôt slide off. Not to mention the sound quality is amazing !! I totally recommend.
5,Kids love the variety of colors and they work well for online learning. Highly recommend
4,It came sooner than expected it‚Äôs supper comfortable I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase
5,I work in a Special Needs classroom at a high school. Many of our students cannot tolerate external noise and for a lot it acts as a trigger for behavior issues. We use these not just to help with this but we are a classroom with high school special needs of all ages and so they are quite often working on different assignments with sound. These headphones work great for this. Due to their simple nature they are very easy to clean and sanitize each day as is required due to Covid. If you are an educator these are very cost effective and work great. I bought the multipack.
4,I like them. They are comfortable. My only gripe is that it's a bit big for my small head.
4,Great for my 10-year-old. Compact and does the job.
4,Love this product... for the money great for my grandkids 35 an 9 year old
4,Great value.  Did not expect this quality.
4,Love them
5,I purchased these for some of my second grade students. I have had no complaints! They fit their ears comfortably and cancel sound well. And the kids love the fun colors! I plan on purchasing another set to have on hand and have shared with my other teacher friends how great they are. Would definitely recommend.
5,I bought these for my son's kindergarten class. They work well and the kids love the colors. Couldn't beat the quality for the price. A nice classroom product.
3,Decent quilty good feel
1,The wire where the button and microphone is breaks within a few days of use won‚Äôt recommend.
5,Product arrived on time without delay. Very colorful headphones and very good quality. Would recommend this product to any and all.
5,I love these headphone I bought for my son and he loves them. Very comfortable and easy to adjust. I would deffendenty reorder another one
1,I have twenty students. I researched and purchased these for my second graders who are in desperate need of headphones. Each student is on a different learning plan. The students liked them; however less than a month later several are already broken.  :.-(
5,Ordered two sets for my boys for Christmas and they love them. They work great for listening to their iPads and gaming. Very affordable. Love that they can fold up for travel.
5,I loved all the qualities of this headset. There is nothing I would change. I work in my home office and I can hear my customers plainly and they are very durable as well.
5,Love the comfort and ease of use of these headphones.  Most feel too large and are more difficult to handle - these are perfect.  Sound is crystal clear in all ranges with no distortion.  Very impressed with all aspects
5,Good headphones for the price wasn‚Äôt expecting them to be small (in my opinion) but nonetheless very good quality with amazing bass...I couldn‚Äôt have gotten a better product
5,This product is very ligth
5,They're very comfortable and I can finally watch my Netflix movies and HEAR them !! Great product !
5,I love them. I use them with my guitar processor. Best thing I ever did. Thank you.
5,The quality of the sound is amazing. The headphones are very comfortable.  Perfect headphones for the price. I have purchased more expensive headphones that were not as good and didn't last. So far very impressed.
5,I helps me in my study. The noise from my surroundings were eliminated.  The sound is clear for my transcription from voice recorder. It is worth more than its price. Thank you.
5,I love this product! Easily the best quality headphones I‚Äôve bought. Over the years I‚Äôve gone through many headphones and all of them were decent enough however strontium have lasted the longest.
5,My husband is very happy with headphones.  If he's happy I'm happy.
5,EXCELLENT!!!
5,Just received my head set I concur with the rest. Five stars for sound quality and price. I hope they last a while so I can't comment on durability yet. They look pretty durable though.
5,This was a gift. I accidentally threw his away after i found them.
5,Good comfort and noise cancellation.
1,I ordered a 5 pack and only received one headphone.
5,I had purchased a pair of ear buds which kept falling out and didn't "seat" well to hear the music. I decided to try headphones but didn't want to spend too much money since I am not an audiophile. The sound on this pair is wonderful. I can hear all the different instruments just like being in a room with the actual instruments positioned in different spots of the room. I haven't had the headphones long enough to know about durability. The tiny button to pause music is in a convenient place.
5,I purchased these for my adult student classroom and they are loved by all!  It was a great price for the quantity and they are much better headphones than I was expecting.  I love that they are all different colors making it easy to assign a set to a specific student.  They work equally well with tablets and laptops with good sound quality and stay plugged in well. They are comfortable to wear even for long periods.  Highly recommend for classrooms and groups.
3,These headphones are made with quality materials and the audio is good but if you use headphones in the workplace I recommend you do not purchase this set.I found them squeezing my ears which began to hurt after just an hour of use and are also heavy to wear so I am now in the process of buying a different headset that is lighter and more comfortable to wear.
5,The headphones worked great for what I needed. School work and instructional listening. Not the greatest for comfort if you had to wear them all day but for kids in a classroom environment they work great.
5,With my kids all doing online learning this year it was nice to be able to buy a bulk pack for a great price. I like that they have different colors available to help differentiate. No complaints so far. They seem to work well for my kiddos.
5,These are working well for my class so far.
5,My grandson loves the headphones.  Great product.  Thank you.
5,Sounds good great price
5,I bought these for my husband. He seems to have no problems with them.
5,Great product for the price.
5,I ordered these for my son. He's had so many different kinds but these are his favorite. He loves the multitude of colors.  They are comfortable and the sound quality is very good.  He's ruff on things and so far these have held up.
5,I requested these on my Amazon classroom wishlist. One of our villagers purchased a 10 pack and my family purchased they other. When I handed them out to the students they were overjoyed. Many actually commented on how nice they were. We‚Äôve used them a week and so far they appear to be of good quality. The padding makes them comfortable to wear for extended periods.
5,Bought this for my daughter and she is loving it. Very comfy.
5,My students have been using these (without a complaint) for about a month. They are easy to store well made and reliable headphones.
5,These headphones are great quality for the price.  I ordered them for my classroom and they work great.  Many other headphones were priced much higher and did not outperform these in any way. I will purchase again.
5,I order headphones for special programs in our school district.  I checked with the teacher and shesaid so far the student headphones are working great!!  Thank you!
5,Great headphones for the classroom!  Great quality and comfortable for kiddos to wear!  Plan on ordering another set from this shop!
5,I buy those headphones for my son  they was so sheep  I didn‚Äôt expect the quality will be so good I give one to my sister she‚Äôs on 30s  she has online class she was so happy with it they stopped any noise from outside My son love them too because they are soft and fit him he‚Äôs 7 y old   reasonable price good quality they comes with nice different colors now now my mom have one my father too and me . Family package every one are happy with it.
5,Our students have gotten good use out of these headphones.  They are durable and work well for our students.  We would recommend them for school use.
5,I bought these for my face to face students.  They are 2nd graders and not the best people to give headphones to but these have worked out very well.  My students still have them in tact even though they have been through falls and squashes.
5,These headphones were perfect for my classroom.  They do what they need to do and allow my students are happy with them.
5,I obtained these headphones through DonorsChoose.org a crowdfunding site supporting classrooms.  Students are rough on headphones and in four years these are the third set we've used.  The kids love the colors and size.  The sound quality is great and they work super well with our classroom Chromebooks.  Sounds quality and comfort are the two most important things to the kids and these have knocked it out of the park.  I was first attracted to the price compared to others and the colors.  Well done Sonitum!
5,Good sound quality and worth for the money.I just love it
5,I‚Äôm a teacher and these headphones work great for my third graders. Often times students come to school with earbuds that are uncomfortable and break easily. I needed something affordable and durable and these headphones have been holding up nicely. I am very pleased with my purchase.
5,My kido goes through ear phones like they are candy.  We have bought expensive ones and really cheap ones.  These seem to be his favorites.  Plus i can buy them in bulk yay....
5,This product was amazing for our students.
5,Bought these to donate to or local grade school.  They were shy on headphones for the kids.  These are being handled by K-5 grade children and so far they have held up very well.
4,This ten pack of headphones were purchased to be used with chromebooks that were assigned from school.  These over the head with ear cushions is the ideal option instead of using the wired ones that go in each ear like those freebies we used to get on the airlines before tablets and smartphones were allowed.  This purchase for our children was not only for noise control as multiple children are attending separate classes simultaneously but also to save money from using their gaming headsets.  The box contains a pair of each color and are individually wrapped in transparent plastic bag.  No one has complained about sound quality breaking up when speaking in the mic or hearing their teachers.  Great value compared to the significantly more expensive options on Amazon or those at the five below.
5,I LOVE these headphones and order them a lot. My son has Autism and they are the only headphones he will use now. I re-order because he breaks them when he's frustrated with something. Usually his iPad. His favorite are the green ones!
2,They are nice looking and the students think they fit fairly well. However they break very easily.
5,Wonderful Headphones. Bought them for my classroom. The Kids love it so much. Thank You.
1,We bought a pack of them for our classroom more than a half of them easily damaged within first 2 weeks like the photo we only started to use them at term 1 2022. Very disappointed.
