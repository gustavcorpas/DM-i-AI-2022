4,Better than aftermarket but expensive.  The quality is always good no ‚Äúburps‚Äù and always consistent.  The cost though ugh‚Ä¶. but that seems to be the case with all brand name cartridges.
3,Bought this combo pack because my printer for whatever stupid reason is out of black ink in the small cartridge (why it has 2 black carts I'll never know). This pack does not have the small black one. While I'm sure the others are fine it was super frustrating to find the ONE I needed wasn't in this pack. Yes that's partly my fault for not looking at the description close enough but when you buy a multi-pack for a printer you expect everything to be there.
4,I was reluctant to switch from my Dell color laser to my second inkjet printer (I was unhappy with a much older HP inkjet).  I've been very happy with the Dell but my new iMac doesn't agree...they're not compatible.  I wasn't able to find another compatible laser that met my needs and Canon inkjet printers have a great reputation.  So I purchased a Canon Pixma despite several reviews critical of its high ink consumption.  Most inkjets suffer from the same criticism.It's not the quantity of ink consumed that is the problem it's the small capacity and relatively high cost of these ink cartridges.  Fortunately you only have to replace the individual cartridges (CMY or BK) as needed.  Though the cost of replacing all 4 inkjet cartridges is less than half the cost of one laser toner cartridge in my 8 years of experience with the laser I needed to replace only one toner cartridge.  I've had the Pixma only 4 months and all 4 cartridges already are low or out of ink.  So in the long run this printer is going to be much more costly to operate than the laser.One reviewer commented on the bizarre combination of cartridges offered by Canon.  Though I was struck by the same question there is some logic to bundling CM and Y dye inks with pigment BK (PGI-225).  The printer appears to consume these 4 cartridges at the same rate while using the dye BK (CLI-226) more sparingly.  So you might need to replace the dye BK cartridge only half as often as the pigment BK.  If they bundled all 5 cartridges you'd wind up with a surplus of the dye BK cartridges.The individual cartridges are easy to replace and you can use them right up until they are "empty".  Whether or not there is any usable ink left is irrelevant because the printer will not print if it detects an empty cartridge.  You must replace it.There are cheaper non-OEM replacement inks out there.  But they're not highly regarded and in this case you get what you pay for.  I shopped around and found the best deal at Amazon.
5,I used to always purchase my ink from Costco. I would take an empty ink cartridge to the store find the matching one and purchase it. I kept the cartridge in a ziploc bag hoping that it would not leak ink. Then there was the fateful day that I went to Costco and they didn't have the correct type of ink. I have a printer that won't print and no ink. I returned to Costco some time later without the ink cartridge because let's get real are you really going to save an empty ink cartridge that has the potential for leaking? I wrote down the model number on a piece of paper but when I got to the store I couldn't find the paper. I bought what I thought looked like the correct cartridge. Horrors when I got home it was more than obvious it was not the correct size. I am embarrassed to say that I was so desperate for ink I actually put it in my printer hoping it would work. Of course it didn't.  I had to return it to Costco. I love their return policies. Let's get something straight a trip to Costco from my house is a half hour trip one way. Three trips is three hours and I still don't have ink! I really didn't want to give the overpriced office supply stores in the area my business. I decided to try purchasing ink online. I had my trepidations what with some of the reviews saying they did not recieve Canon ink. I gave it a try. This is the way I purchase my ink now. It is easy to get the correct size just look up on your orders what you purchased in the past. I have always revieved Canon brand ink. The only down side is that you have to plan for when you are going to run out of ink and have it available or do without for a few days. I absolutely love the convience and accuracy of purchasing ink this way. I highly recommend it.
5,Print üñ® quality excellent. Delivery was spot on.
4,Yes this is ink. Actually good ink too. I will use the genuine stuff whenever printing important photos. The chemistry that happens when you print with good ink on special paper makes it dry just enough so that it does not run or blend but slow enough so that it is smooth not lumpy and it bonds to the paper just right. It also helps with water resistance. The ink is actually a far more carefully engineered product than the printer. Some colors of ink aren't used in photo printing. Then it does not matter. Read the manual. Now... here's the bad part- This stuff is expensive. You also have to pay for a little LED and a chip to run it on every one. Every time the printer sits for a while it does a service when restarted. The head cleaning inveigles squirting out vast quantities of the expensive ink before printing. This happens no matter how you set your preferences. Worse still it does this cleaning routine every time the power flickers. Here in FL in 2013 that is several times a day. The power companies had that fixed back in the late 70's but the grid is no longer maintained.  I recommend using aqn uninteruptable power source UPS)  for the main computer and the printer to prevent dropouts. For these reasons I will use cheap knockoff ink from the Office Despot or the like when not printing photos and for the tanks that don't get used in photo printing. Actually I refill them but your results may vary so don't do it unless you are into that.Robs rating: As if you have a choice? Hold your nose and buy it.
5,Product came in on time. I‚Äôve used this product before with good results.
5,I trust Canon products.  I've thought about saving on copy cat ink products but for the amount I save I would worry of hurting the printer with ink leakage streaks and smudges.  I generally changes cartridges about once a year.
2,This review is for the Pixma iX6520 printer cartridges so your printer config may be different. Lift the printer's lid to see what inks you need/have. In a nutshell these cartridges simply do not hold enough ink for the price and the packaging makes you think you're getting all the inks you need in this one package. Sadly neither is true.First the ink cartridges:I get maybe twenty pages printed (like emails or word docs nothing to graphic intensive) and I get a low ink notice. If I print a picture at regular setting a tank gets zapped even faster. When the low ink notice shows up it means I've got about five more "regular" pages before the tank is dry. It also means having to order another batch of these as buying them separately is cost-prohibitive. The odd thing is that the original inks that came with the printer seemed to last forever so I'm at a loss at to why this an issue. The ink colors run out at different times and so I just buy these packages two at a time and use as necessary.Which brings up the second problem:For some reason which may have to do with the different models these cartridges fit you'll run out of the CMY Black colors faster than the big black one (PGBK-225). If that's the case get the CLI-226 4-Color Pack or the CLI-226 CMY 3-Color Pack as they are cheaper.If you do need all FIVE replaced be sure to buy the CLI-226BK as it's not included in this package (PGI-225/CLI-226 4 Color Pack). If you decide to get the CLI-226 4-Color Pack you'll need to buy the PGI-225 BK Ink Tank separately as it's not included in that package.That's because you can't buy all five inks in one package unless you go generic (trust me I've done that with another printer and lived to regret it) or even get all five in one package at the Canon store. Though you spend a bit more at the Canon store they do give you lots of free goodies with your ink purchase (I'm drowning in very high-quality matte gloss photo paper from my previous purchases there.) and free ground shipping.Quality:The inks are very good but will smear on plain copy paper if you pick it up right after printing. That's because the ink needs time to dry. I've smudged enough documents to know that I need to wait about 10 seconds before handling the printed document. Photographs look great when printed on photographic paper (I use Canon for the reason shown above) but don't stand the test of time that "regular" photographs you have developed by a drugstore or camera shop. You can bring your camera's SD card to just about any camera place or drugstore to have your pictures developed using the high quality standards of Kodak. A picture I printed using this Pixma a year ago is already starting to fade. Not a lot but enough to be noticeable.I've knocked off a star for the small amount of printing you get with these cartridges another star for the terrible bundling and a third one for the pricing.I've attached a picture of my iX6520 with the lid open showing the five inks it eats on a regular basis. Also attached showing ink levels after replacing a few of the cartridges. Note that they don't drain equally so it's hard to determine what you'll need to purchase in the future. I think in total I've boughten this printer two-times-over just in the amount of ink I've used. Shame really that they (Canon) don't give you more bang for the buck.
4,I love my Canon Pixma MX882. It does everything with only a few technical slip ups here and there but still very worthwhile.Strangely enough magenta ran out first even though I print mainly black and white documents. I am going to wait until all the ink cartridges are completely dry and then replace. Well nearly dry that is.For the price it is hard to beat and I have checked local office stores as well. I do wish that Canon would put all necessary ink cartridges in this package such as ordering a special for all MX models as an example. So after all is said and done I paid about $56 for all ink tanks and that is with all the promotions.A strong recommendation is to use the 'draft' printing option on your printer (File -- Print -- Printer Options -- Main -- Quality = Draft) and make sure you print only what you absolutely need. I really don't need to print any longer but some people insist on having a physical copy. Even jobs that I've applied to want me to bring my application printed out to them. Uhhh don't they have money for this?Well back to the ink tank I think you will get great life out of this. With very mild printing (1-2/week -- few documents) I was able to make my printer last about 7 months and magenta was the first to show signs of fatigue.
3,I've been purchasing Canon ink for my Canon printer faithfully sticking to brand for years since I purchased the printer.  Every time I need to buy more the prices are jacked up not only here but everywhere. It's like a price fix you would see on high-end cosmetics.  Why the prices are so high is beyond me.  I'm finally going to try a generic version Amazon sells that has excellent reviews at a mere fraction of the cost.  My warranty on the printer expired so there is no risk of violating it by using another's ink. And I do not print photos so I see no need to burn money like this.  Shame on Canon!
1,So I have to retract my earlier review. My ex-husband purchased this printer for me one Christmas about 8 years ago. I am a graphic designer and make-up artist. Having hard copies of my before and after work helps me book jobs. I did use it quite a bit upon it's initial purchase. I enjoyed the many options for adjusting the image before printing them that way I hardly ever wasted ink or paper. Two years after purchasing it my husband was Sent to prison for being in the states on an expired visa under his father's name. I ended up losing everything. Packed up my belongings and had to stay with family. I made sure to disconnect the in cartridges and thoroughly wrapped up the printer in its original packaging. I even stored it in my closet that way it wouldn't get beat damage. I never used it while living with family. I was too paranoid that it would get damaged or broken. I had two niece's living with us in the toddler phase I in order to prevent damage to my printer I just kept it wrapped up and hidden in my closet. Recently I brought it out of hibernation to use creating graphic designs for my friends candle company and to print out some photos of my family. Of course I had to replace the in cartridges but overall it was still like brand new. Until recently!With new cartridges and  a few different cleaning cycles my printer t behaving erratic and pauses while printing the simplest things with limited text and no images of color at all. The cartridges are displaying as if they are almost empty which is impossible because they were just purchased and I've only used them 3-4 times in the last few months. I'm aware that my particular model is old compared to the newer models available but this is ridiculous. My ex paid almost $500 for this Canon printer and I hardly ever used it. I've troubleshoot the issue cleaned the cartridges you name it I've done it...twice! Still no change. Plus it's no longer under warranty. What are my options? Why is it draining my expensive ink cartridges after only a few uses? Canon products are not what they used to be. That's for damn sure!üò¢
4,It is difficult to write a review for ink. I purchased the ink that went to my printer. I will say is that ink just does not seem to go as far as it used to. I often find with my Canon printer that I run out of the smaller individual colors much more frequently. I took the time to break it down once... I found that the multi-pack was still less expensive. When printer ink first started to separate the ink so you could replace only the color you needed everyone rejoiced. Then everyone discovered how much more they were paying for this convenience.  One thing I will point out... My experience is with Canon ink so I can't speak for other brands. When I order a box of inks or grab one at the store Canon is the first to point out how nice they are for including a package of standard picture paper. So I will be the first to point out that the paper is a very clever marketing scheme... Canon "gives" you free paper because you are sure to blow through a box of ink using the "free" paper inside. If your intent is to always print pictures then this is a great deal and works perfect for that clientele.
5,Does what it's supposed to do!
5,These were the cartridges I needed and arrived promptly. I have not yet installed them so I cannot comment on the quality or longevity but assume they are consistent with Canon's normal quality which has been excellent. The package did arrive somewhat crushed but there is no apparent damage to the cartridges.
4,The ink that came with the printer went quickly (though we did print quite a few pictures) and so first went the gray ink (which went shockingly fast I can't understand how this printer uses so much gray ink) and was soon followed by the three remaining colors.  We purchased this three pack to replace them all as they all wore relatively evently.  We haven't yet had to use the black replacement though that day is coming soon.The quality of ink of course is superb.  The reliability I would only rate as above average the yellow head got clogged and in order to unclog it we had to do the "deep clean" which was true to it's word when it warned that it would consume a considerable amount of ink.  Thus my rating for quality of build unlike the HP which just crapped out on me (a $400 inkjet no less) this was able to fix itself though at an expense of used ink.Convenience of course is fantastic changing the ink takes all of 30 seconds.  I think this ink though expensive and of low quantity is worth the price premium over generics.
5,I just purchased the Canon MX712 AIO printer at BJ's for $89.99. I've always liked Canon products and liked the individual ink cartridges. I haven't run out of ink yet but I wanted to have a supply on hand. Depending on what you print and at what settings you will find that you will always run out of one color before the others. So my first purchase is always a combo pack. The only problem is that BJ's had the entire 5 pack of ink replacement cartridges for $69.99 and I had to buy this cartridge and a combo pack (4530B008) with PGI-225 BK CLI-226 CMY. Total price on Amazon $55.88 (saving $14.11). Although I had to purchase 2 separate items I got what I needed and they arrived the very next day (I am a Prime member with free 2 day delivery). For those who argue that there should be a combo pack available as the one that BJ's has I believe that there is a compatible Grey color cartridge that is use in other Canon printers (used in photography prints) instead of this black cartridge. So someone who doesn't need the smaller black cartridge can buy the grey instead.
4,Canon printers are often pretty good.. The printer I have I've had for 6-7 years.. It works great.. It faxes scans prints... Only thing.. the ink cartridges are EXPENSIVE as all hell..  I pretty much but a set once every 18-20 months. But the thing is I very rarely use my printer.. I may print something once maybe twice a month.The quality is great just think ink is overpriced.
4,I ordered the Canon Cli-226 Value Pack 4530B008 ink cartridges to replace the ones in my Canon PIXMA MG8220 that had ran out & it works.  I've read the other comments before I had made my purchase & my Canon PIXMA MG8220 is no different.  It just sucks the ink out of these cartridges just so damn fast.  This in no way is the fault of the ink cartridge that I'm writing the review for but the problem is with the Canon printer.  I just wish the tanks were a bit bigger for the price you pay it would come in handy since I have to buy 6 different ones for my printer.I heard that if you leave your Canon printer on continuously & never turn it off that it'll do less maintenance with the ink cartridges & that the ink would last longer with time.
5,I use my Canon ix6520 to produce mainly photos of 8x10 or larger and only the occasional office document so I don't need double the document black ink.  My experience with third party inks has been less than stellar over the last few years so the really bargain brands are a no go.  The inks tanks came loose without the usual factory packaging but look to be genuine Canon and came in the same box as the photo black ink I ordered as a separate item from the same vendor.  The prints look good though I haven't done any really critical printing yet I expect that they'll be just fine.
5,Let me caution other Canon printer and all-in-one owners about using non-Canon ink cartridges.In the early tenure of my Canon MP 780 I tried using the less expensive non-Canon ink cartridges with poor results: clogging frequent cleaning less than acceptable print patterns. This was corrected by returning to the Canon cartridges.Lead astray again by the siren song of lower INITIAL cost I experienced the same results. Thorougly chastened I again returned to Canon cartridges and used them through the life of the MP 780. It performed flawlessly through its long life so long that when it printed out an alert that the over flow reservoir tank was nearly full Canon was no longer making parts for the MP 780.That warning was the first and only issue other than the cheap ink problems I ever experienced with the Canon MP 780.Moral of the story: To avoid hassles don't use non-Canon inks.I am now the proud owner of an MX 882 and have no reason to expect anything less in terms of longevity.
5,These cartridges are expensive (I remember when hamburgers were 15 cents a burger) but what ink cartridge is not these days?  I've always used these Canon ink cartridges and have never been disappointed.  I'll continue to only buy these for my Canon printer. There may be cheaper ones on the market but I'm not buying them.
4,The ink in these cartridges works just fine.  Performance in the machine and installation are also just fine but the price and quantity is not so good.  Are we reaching a point where the manufacturer almost gives you the printer (machine) for nearly free and then charges a ton of money for the carts to make their profit back?As some other reviewers have noted.  The combo doesn't work for my machine either.  I have to add another cartridge to make a full set.  Somewhere in the deal I end up buying a very expensive single cartridge to complete this set.  Not too much savings in that...So performance wise the carts are okay if we disregard that the carts run out of ink very quickly.
5,Although the ink cartridges do not seem to last as long as I had hoped the nice thing about them is that the colors are separated. I normally only purchase the color I am running low on but this time I purchased this package because I plan on doing a lot of prints.The other week I heard on NPR that the average cost of printer ink was about $5000 per gallon. I laughed when I heard this. So I decided to calculate how much Canon ink was going for a gallon.When my ink arrived in the mail I happened to be out of yellow or CLI-226Y. I weighed my my empty cartridge at 0.40oz. I weighed the new one with the cap off at 0.70oz which gives 0.30oz of ink. So at 0.30oz of ink per cartridge and 128oz in a gallon that totals 427 yellow ink cartridges. 427 individual yellow ink cartridge costing $13.89 each totals $5931.00 per gallon.If you want the best prints use OEM ink. I am really happy with my Canon printer and the price of the cartridges is fair.
4,I give four stars for canon not including the fifth pack needed to complete the set. Otherwise with frugal use the combo prints great lasts a decent amount of time and is a reasonable price for the four pack. I don't understand why people give much lower stars for not having the fifth pack. It tells you right on the ad page it only contains four packages. READ people! If anyone has used refills like me I find them messy a real hassle and they don't hold up to use or quality in the end making the manufacturer's product far superior. Canon has always come through with quality products for me and Amazon has always fulfilled my orders quickly and professionally. You get what you pay for and Canon is one of the best. If you want it the price will reflect the quality. Good job Canon minus the greed for the fifth pack sold separately.
5,I looked everywhere in stores for this product but I guess they don't sell this anymore. So Now I have to buy it online and is the same price about 5 dollars more than the one in the store. Over this is great and is perfect for my Cannon MG200 printer but wish was cheaper.
4,I probably spend $200 a year on ink and I don't use my printer very often.  I just use it for jobs that depend on good quality.  I use my black and white laser printer for everything else which I use all the time almost every day and only have to buy toner every 2 or 3 years.
4,It is canon ink for your printer.It works as advertised unless your printer is broken or you inserted in wrong direction.It prints about 200 4"x6" photo print if you are determined to print them all at once.Otherwise your mileage may vary (for the worse never for better).I do agree that inks are pointlessly expensive and only reason is to pad profit for the manufacturer.I will not/cannot use third party manufactured inks because I mostly print photo papers which are notoriously ink dependent on quality of the print.I do not wish for my printer's demise as newer printers doesn't sip on inks any better and those inks are just as if not more expensive as this.
4,The product works well.  My only complaint is that my Canon MG5300 series printer actually has 5 cartridges not 4.  It was totally my mistake. I saw the big black cartridge and the 3 color and thought it was a complete set. I should have been more careful.  There are actually 4 small cartridges (the fourth is a small black one).  I took away the star because I believe this product should have ALL the cartridges. I am baffled why it is left out.  The only thing I can think of is that maybe there is another Canon printer that uses only these? A warning would be nice. Not to mention the money lost because I had to go out and buy the other cartridge nearby.
5,Delivery was fast and item was as ordered.
5,I keep a box of cartridges on hand in my office all the time. My printer Canon MX 882 seems to run out of ink at different times. So the yellow may run out sooner than the pink. So if I have the complete box of 4 cartridges to go to I can replace them one by one.While it may be tempting to buy just the yellow or just the black I find the price is far better in this 4 pack no matter where you shop. This is the best price I've found anywhere.I love that each ink cartridge is wrapped individually and easy to unwrap and install. Some cartridges will leave you covered in ink and create a huge mess. These are simple to unwrap have perforated rip lines in the packaging that actually work and never leave a mess.Great product for your Canon printer.
4,Keeping in mind that a review is of the product the product works great. My pictures look good the ink dries rapidly I haven't had fading issues over the 4 (or has it been 7) years I have had it over 4000 pictures.  But the printer takes 6 (SIX) cartridges. Is there a really good reason Canon can't market them evenly? Why isn't gray included with the other colors? Are they afraid it will cost too much? They do anyway but I continue to buy them. And why can't Amazon Prime them all?
5,Canon original so the price isnt the best but quality was good.
5,I use to buy refills and wondered why I was always replacing my printers so often. Turns out that you run a high risk of damaging your printer when you use the "non factory" cartridges. If you have a printer you don't mind replacing then I can understand not paying extra for the manufacturer cartridges. However these last a long time and I can avoid getting my fingers inked up trying to make my own refills. A side note: check your print settings and your manual because there are ways to get the most ink from your printer. For example apparently most new printers have an automatic setting where every time the print turns on or wakes from sleep mode it cleans the print heads. This uses up ink every time it does that.
5,I was about to give up on my Canon Pixma ip6500 because it wasn't printing anything except smudges and wrong colors. As it turns out it was completely the fault of aftermarket reconstituted ink cartridges! Even the best reviewed supplier of them was garbage. My printer is saved due to this last ditch attempt to rescue it with OEM inks!!!
4,Just seeing the literal walls of inks for printers screams out 'there has to be a better way!'So many different inks so many different sizes and numbers some day we will look back and say wow that was a waste.\Some overkill on the packaging too if you layout all the stuff you get to receive what essentially a few teasoons of ink is a big plastic piece small plastic cap shrink plastic over all this and this all wrapped in plastic whoch is then boxed. With paper instructions. Environmentally this is about as 'Green' as a 1972 Cadillac.Does what it's supposed to do deliver ink but too much stuff. "Green packaging' option would be nice.
4,I depend on the name brand cartridges to ensure that we get quality print. We use our printer regularly and often for photos. I've used printers that used alternative cartridges and I've never found any that function as efficiently as those made by the same manufacturer. We pay just the slightest amount more for them but I believe we pretty much our money's worth out of them. Don't get me wrong--I'd appreciate if they were more cost effective but they seem comparable to their quality competitors.
5,I love this ink cartridge set.  I have used this ink since the day i purchased my Canon all in one printer and have not thought of purchasing another brand or set.  These work well for what I need.  They are of great quality and seem to last a long time.  I do not print very often so in between print jobs I can say that the ink does not dry up - seems to last a long time.  The product is as advertised and I will always buy this brand and type until the printer dies or the product is no longer of great quality.  I would recommend to others.
3,The usual Canon ripoff -- expensive.  And the color inks still run out even if you only print black and white documents.  Still the Canon multifunction printers are pretty good and you can control costs by using a laser printer most of the time.The ink is high quality though and I've had zero problems with my MX822 printer for three years using it.UPDATE for owners of Canon MX922 and possibly other NEWER multifunction printers:  After many years Canon has FINALLY fixed the annoying problem where the FAX/printer will falsely "pick up" a call which the printer mistakenly assumes is a FAX call even when you're in the middle of a simple voice call.  This has the effect of cutting off your call in mid-sentence.  If your MX922 is still within warranty Canon will replace it for free with a new correctly functioning model.  Nice!  But if you're like me and the warranty is long expired they won't.  Not sure about the story with other multifunction models from Canon.
5,I am hoping that my old Cannon printer lasts a long long time because I do not like what I see in the new models.Having to replace a whole cartridge even if one color is out seems ridiculous to me. Ink is not cheap. Who decided that was a good idea? Please continue to keep this in stock
4,Everything was there as described.  Fits perfect in my printer. I was hoping it would be here in 2 days but it was over a week before it got here.  Other then that it was perfect.  I bought it along with another pack of black ink so got it for a reasonable price.  For only one box of color at my local office supply store it cost close to the same price as I paid for both the color and the black online.. so I got a deal :)
4,I only use Canon ink in our Canon printers.  The main reason I do so is that in the past when I used 3rd-party inks I always had to take the printers in for maintenance and cleaning every year or so until they became unrepairable.  I have a 2004 printer that has never needed maintenance or cleaning and our second printer now two years and counting continues to operate without issues.  Also in my experience 3rd-party inks have faded faster than the Canon inks.  Yes they are too expensive.  Isn't everything?
4,I print a fair amount of colored documents and photographs so I want the official Canon ink for my Canon MX892 printer. This ink was fresh is working well and came so quickly with Amazon Prime. This price beats Staples by a long shot. I only gave 4 stars because I wish they would include the fourth small cartridge (black) that is also needed.
5,I only buy original CANON cartridges.  I ruined a previous printer by using cheap generic ink cartridges-plugged nozzles.  I will never do that again!I ordered cheap priced faux "Canon" cartridges on EBAY but recieved suspicious unwrapped cartridges one of which was broken I think they were refilled tanks.  I returned them.  I will never do that again!The Amazon CANON cartridges were shipped very quickly.  My only complaint is that the combo pak did not have a gray cartridge (226) included.  I had to go to an Office Depot 30 miles away to get a gray so that the printer would start & run.  It will not run unless all 6 cartridges are full.
5,I usually buy this item at Staples or any other office supply store.Prices are almost the same everywhere.Very quick deliveryItem arrives almost next day.
4,This was the best price I could find. Still you are missing the small black cartrige so you have to buy it seperate. The value packs either have the small black or the large black but not both. Also like someone else stated it doesn't have the gray. I don't use the gray so that is not an issue. I might be wrong but I think you need both blacks for the printer to work. The printer is not that old and this is the first set of inks I have bought and have not used yet. Just having on hand when needed all the cartriges that came with the printer.
4,I have been burned a couple of times by trying to buy less expensive cartriges for my Cannon printers.  They do not get used that frequently so I've found that the refills and even some of the clones I've purchased just do not hold up and function well in that situation.  My biggest complaint is the price Cannon is able to charge but at least you can put a cartridge in the printer and it will function until the ink runs out even if that is several months of relative inactivity.
5,Not all office supply stores carry Cannon and this was simply perfect - especially during this time of confinement.
5,These are expensive but the quality of the print is important for us.
4,The ink is what you would expect: long-lasting Canon-quality stuff. I just want to offer a word of caution to those ordering the tanks for their IP4820 printers: the Canon CLI-226 Black Ink Tank is not included and must be purchased separately in order for the printer to continue to print. The description of the ink tanks is correct so this is not a fault of the seller. I mention this only to save others the hassle of discovering the "missing" cartridge and then needing to wait a few days longer for the Canon CLI-226 Black Ink Tank to arrive before being able to print.
5,OEM ink isn't cheap but it gives the best quality print in my opinion. Price was about the same delivered as what big box store has and it saves me the trip.
4,Ink cartridges for printer
5,Very quick ship. Good consistent color.
5,OEM Printer ink for Cannon Printer  these work great but are a little pricey
4,The prices for ink are outrageous. I am not one to use anything other than the brand name inks because I am happy with the results. Just want to gripe about the prices being so high. One day I won't be able to buy these for my Canon Pixma MX882. The machine works great. The consumables make it expensive.
5,I always use OEM ink in my printer because I know it works. Thankfully I don't print a high volume though because the Gillette business model used by the ink jet manufacturers would drain my bank account.
5,I bought the Canon PIXMA MG5320 from my local best Buy and was a little hesitant because I saw how much the replacement ink cartridges were. And when they started running out I said to myself wait everything is cheaper and easier to buy on the internet. So I went to trusty ol' google and typed in the printer model and the words ink cartridge and trusty ol' google lead me to trust ol' amazon.com where I found these. About half the price they are in the store. I ordered them and received them in just a few days with free shipping none the less. Great product. Excellent price. Couldn't be a happier customer. Thanks a lot!
4,The ink is fine.  Like another reviewer I do use the cartridges past the time when I start being notified that the ink is low.  My only complaint is that this package has 4 cartridges while the printer takes 5.  It is another $17 to get the second black cartridge (226).  I have found packages with all the cartridges at Costco any plan to make future purchases there.
4,I only get the official Canon cartridges now even though they cost more than discount cartridges.  I think that discount cartridges may have contributed to the demise of my last 2 printers.  After the last one died from a clogged something I vowed never again to skimp on ink.  I've never had problems when I stay with the Canon cartridges.  Giving just 4 stars because the cartridges are opaque and I don't like that I can't see how much is really left.
5,My computer
3,I hesitate to think what I pay per page to print using this ink but I can tell you we probably print an average of 20 pages of documents with minimal images per week and we go through ink like it was water.Of course we had the same issue with our old HP ink jet printer as well.The cartridges are simple to swap out and the ink is nice.We buy these because we have the printer that uses them and I've found lower cost generic cartridges usually cause problems.  Every time I buy these I look for a new printer but ink jets seem designed to consume ink so I just grin and bear it as I hit the "Add to Cart" button.
4,The ink does come in a silver bag & I wondered how I could tell it was genuine. I called cannon. They confirmed their ink was made in Japan and it had all the correct label details--great! I found a new supplier for our crazy ink-eating printer! I'm great with no box but sometimes the extra effort is worth the peace of mind. If you've been burned you know. Now we both know!
4,For years I have suffered through HP printers dissapointments.  Finally I payed up for a Canon so that photos would hopefully come out and be good enough to go on the wall.  We are not dissapointed with the results of the PIXMA MG6220 and the PIXMA ink and Photo paper.  My friend couldn't believe the photos I showed him came from my printer.  With HP it was obvious they were not good at all.The ink doesn't last as long as you would like but what else is new.
4,The only reason I give this a 4 star is because my dinky Cannon MG5220 requires not only the big black 225 cartridge and all three of the other colors but also another small black ink cartridge.  This is not included in this box.  I tried to find one on amazon with all that I needed in one replacement but was only able to find the packs where there are either a singe small black cartridge or a set of two small ones.  But otherwise a great buy.
4,Bought these because of the low price but have not used them yet. I also ordered the black set. The boxes were dented in upon arrival (possibly someone getting them from the trash bin?) and the shink wrap looks like the do it yourself kind using a blow dryer. I will update when I use them which may be a while.
5,These are OEM ink cartridges so there will be no issues with warranty or support.  They provide the same high quality as the original cartridges.
3,What can I say...I have a Canon inkjet printer so I have to buy these. My PIXMA M882 printer runs out of ink ridiculously fast. Like I will print a dozen color photos and it starts up with the blinking lights. The ink is way too over-priced but I am scared to get a generic brand with cartridges that might get stuck inside the printer. Changing the ink is an ordeal and it's tricky for me to place a new ink cartridge in just so.The prints are decent quality but I wish I had enough money to buy another printer.
4,They do a good job replacing ink in the canon ink jet but they don't last long I think even with the printer tired off the ink may evaporate as even with relatively frugal use they all run out quickly  But what can you do other than get a large reservoir more expensive laser printer seems like overkill for home use.
5,I have tried other brands of ink for my printer and they are all watery or do not turn out the right color balance.  The price for this pack on amazon is much cheaper than buying it at staples.  almost any other place these cartridges are 15 dollars each so this pack would be 60 bucks.  The canon ink produces great colors on the glossy plus ii paper.  I have not really like any other gloss paper I have used from other manufacturers.
4,Packaged very well. I like being able to purchase the combination needed for my MX882. What I would really like is for the Black 226 to be included in the combination. However I did find a package with two of the Black 226 in it and liked that combination. The only problem I find is that the ink cartridges do not last long at all which I think would be a problem created by Canon. Because of this problem I probably would not purchase the MX882 again.
4,The cartridges are small so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that they don't last very long. I do get good quality 4x6 and 5x7 glossy photos from this ink which is what I use it for exclusively so I can't comment on other types of papers. So...They are a bit pricey (two replacements of ink have cost has much as the printer I use them in) don't last as long as one would like in a photo printing capacity but produce quality images.
4,These were okay but I feel better buying them at a Staples Store. If there is an issue with cartridge it can be handled quicker.((WORDS OF ADVICE - Don't ever buy Canon Ink Cartridges on eBay. You never know -- and cannot prove -- if they are old defective or both.))
3,I had been using generic ink for some time because this ink is soo expensive! But over time my printer stopped printing in Blue and Black. I bought these on a prayer  thinking I was going to need a new printer.. thankfully it is printing just fine again. I hate the price for the canon ink but it‚Äôs a ‚Äúnecessary evil‚Äù if you want your canon printer to work correctly. This was the best price I could find for the name-brand ink.
5,Canon ink is a bit more expensive but I've never had a problem with it. I tried the "Brand X" ink once in an effort to save a few bucks and eventually it clogged the heads and I wound up having to replace the printer. So now I stick with Canon-branded ink for my Canon printer and no more problems.
5,I love the Canon printer I got to replace an HP that kept telling me it was out of paper when it had a stack.  I researched for a couple weeks and settled on the Canon printer and have not had a problem with it.  These refills are quite expensive so when I found them here on Amazon for $15-20 cheaper per pack than anywhere else I found them I ordered 2.  I do wish the printer would not run out of colors so fast but it is worth it to buy them since the printer actually keeps working!
5,Much cheaper as a pack than buying individual ink cartridges. Arrived as photographed. New in package.
4,They cost too much and run out too fast. Even printing exclusively in B&W the printer somehow burns color ink. I like the features and the output of my Canon printer but the ink usage is a scan. I spend more on ink in a year than the printer cost--and I don't print too frequently.
5,What do I want from my printer ink?  Simple things. I want to install it with ease and print with clarity.  Check and check. I really appreciate the package deal being available online.  I only needed 2 of the inks but now one of the others is running out and I can just go to my drawer get it out pop it in... done!  Couldn't find this ink at places like Target because my printer is "too old" (i.e. not the latest model).  Didn't want to drive cross town to nearest Best Buy.  Amazon had what I wanted easy purchase happy customer!
4,Even w/ my Staples credit for returning cartridges this is still the best price I've found for this ink...and if you need/use this ink you know your printer needs it more often than you'd have guessed or liked.  So - I order from Amazon; its delivered amazingly fast; used/save the cartridges til I have enough credit at Staples built up (but that does take MONTHS) and only then do I buy ONE pack at Staples.  then back to Amazon.
4,I use this type of ink so it's just a matter of who supplies it most often.  This time I had a bit of trouble getting it started and had to run through a couple of set up and ink testing pages to get the ink to flow evenly.  That may not be a big deal but since they do not last that long it's a little irritating for the price.
5,printing can now continue perfectly
5,I first bought this ink for use in a photobooth at a friend's wedding in March. We printed about 300 full color 4x6" prints. It's August 30 and I'm STILL using the same cartridges for normal day-to-day use. I've had the 'low ink' indicator for about a month now but not seeing any streaking or light colors. I'm VERY satisfied with these cartridges! I'm setting up a photobooth at another wedding next week so I just bought another set of cartridges so I can have fresh ones for that event.FYI - I use a Canon MG 5300.
4,Ordering and Delivery was very easy especially as it was delivered to me at an hotel when i was travelling.  The only concern i have is the rate of consumption of the ink which i think is high.  The print quality is quite good though.Before buying the ink catridge i had also read about so many people that had bought cartridges that spilled.  This was nont the case with this catridge.
5,I normally purchase this locally.  This was as described and shown on the page.
5,I once made the mistake of buying an off-brand refill in the hopes of saving money. Bad move my ink clogged causing the printer to stop working. A quick call to Canon got my printer working again at no charge. Nothing but the best Canon for me from now on.
5,Don't buy off brands!  I've tried an off brand that messed up my printer and now I'm waiting for my next Canon order to arrive to find out if my printer is permanently messed up or just doesn't work with the off brand ink.  I never had any issues with Canon ink.  I tried an off brand this last order (which was A LOT less expensive) and my printer stopped working and makes terrible noises.  I'll be sticking with Canon ink.  NO more off brands for me!
4,I have been an HP printer user for many years. I switched to the Canon when we needed a new wireless printer. I heard about the cartridges running out of ink but I have not been bothered by it. The printer sends plenty of warnings about the ink status and so I keep spares on hand. I am thinking about re-filling at Costco...will let you know.
4,I don't print too often but when I do I expect a functional ink cartridge.  I routinely had my used cartridges refilled but they dried out very quickly.  Sure you save a few bucks on refills.  These are little more expensive but well worth it.  With OEM ink cartridges you can't go wrong.  JMHO
5,Around Christmas of 2012 I needed to purchase a printer and decided on Canon MG6620 purchased on Amazon.com felt that I got a very good price and very happy with my purchase.  Here's the thing I am a student at CTU-online College and needed this printer yesterday.  Buying a printer means you will have to purchase ink cartridges and this printer has 6 cartridges.  The ink has been an investment and is not cheap to purchase the quality from the Canon Value Pack has been worth the cost.  Like the vivid color and quality the prints.
5,I have a great newer Canon printer and my business does lots of daily printing.  Canon ink gives me excellent clarity no smudging and great color when needed.  I have found that while it appears the ink is used up I simply hit the 'ok' key on the printer and I can continue to get lots more production printing until the ink actually 'runs out' much later.  I do not use 'comparable' products.  While they might be satisfactory I am very pleased with Canon ink and will continue to use it with my Canon equipment.
4,I found the purchase convenient and equal to or better than other similar packages pricewise.  Ink cartridges are very expensive and both price and delivery make this a preferred method for me.  I do a lot of photo printing.  I have tried cartridges other than Canon and also cartridge refills. Both compare poorly to the Canon cartridges.  I plan to continue purchasing from Amazon whenever necessary.
5,Four stars because I believe in Canon ink for Canon printers. Never had a problem with either. This is a good value for the money compared to local wholesale chain stores and Canon's website prices. Delivery is always on time and when promised even though I always order before needed. Print a lot of photos and my photos are just as good if not better then some of the online photo printing services. You can go wrong if you want an ink cartridge that will work very well in your Canon printer for a reasonable cost.
5,For me Canon is the best product out there on the market.  Their ink bar none is the most saturated.  I am an amateur photographer and love the quality of the pics from my Canon printers.
5,Nothing special about this.  This is a great quality Canon OEM ink.  I haven't tried any non-Canon inks to compare this to.  (Nor do I want to try after reading some bad reviews about bleeding color on print outs or leaking ink cartridges.)I would recommend this product if you print a lot in color.  Buying this value pack is less expensive - both price and shipping costs - than buying individual ink cartridges.  Also buying four ink cartridges at once avoids you the trouble of ordering the ink too often.
5,This product is an original Canon product. So it works as expected. Beautiful colors. Crisp edging. Performs perfectly. A bit overpriced for an online Amazon product; but hey I got what I expected.Updated February 9th 2013...battery is reliable; does not fail or go belly up without reason. I recharge it every night with a Canon charger designed for the battery. It recharges in several hours and will last almost 24 hours with continuous use before needing recharging. I have since bought several more of these to have a good one on hand at all times.
4,Yep....I love COSTCO (my usual purchase place) but I LOVED Amazon's price on these a bit better.  This packet is one cartridge short (Costco has an added black "226" [the smaller] cartridge too)...but I was looking for an more affordable price (around $42).  You can usually replace these one at a time in my Canon printer and they seem to last fairly well.
5,I have the MG6100 Canon printer and I love it. The color prints are vivid and crisp and the ink dries quickly. I like that I can buy the ink individually or in a pack and lasts quite a while. Years ago I had a Dell and tried using the 'compatible' types of ink because they were cheaper. Never again I had so many problems and the colors were never very good with anything except name brand ink cartridges. That was one of the reasons I purchased this printer the inks are fairly inexpensive. Definitely recommend.
4,I checked all the office supply stores and they were either much more expensive or only offered then generic brand cartridges. This is a good deal for all 4 but I am not sure how long they will last. I don't print too often (maybe a few pages once or twice a week) and they are still showing 3/4 full.
3,Unfortunately for me this package makes you buy a black cartridge that lasts a long time but doesn't give you the gray cartridge which doesn't.  I do 99% photos and the black will last forever while the yellow magenta and cyan is sucked down at an alarming rate along with the gray.  In order to take advantage of this "bargain" price on the colored inks I have to buy the black which I don't really use.  If you do about 50-50 documents and photos it might be a better deal.  Still I wish they would add the gray to the other colors in a package and not make you buy the large black ink if you don't need it.
5,This system works well even for an oldster like me.  I need things to be simple and have well written printed instructions.  These ink cartridges (plus the companion one that is for black only) are perfect for keeping my wonderful Canon printer in top shape.  I can easily install the cartridges and the printing is excellent.  If you have treated yourself to a Canon printer then you need to use these Canon inks.
4,Purchased this ink for my new¬†  Canon Pixma MX882 Wireless Office All-in-One Inkjet Printer (4894B002)        ¬†printer. I've been using HP ink for the last decade and finally gave Canon a try since I shoot film / video with Canon cameras for my business. I would Highly recommend these cartridges as replacement in your Canon printer - Go OEM so you don't jam up your printer.
5,This ink always prints beautifully and I have never had any problems with the cartridges in any color!  Wish the ink lasted a little longer but I never change it right away when it warns me I need to replace a cartridge as there is always ink in there for about 10 or 15 more pages.  I let it print something long and it just stops printing when there is no more ink and starts right up on the page it left off as soon as I replace that cartridge.
4,If you own a printer you've already spent too much for toner.  This was bought for my daughters roommate in college since she used up most of it up over the course of the semester.  The replacement toner worked well and didn't blotch but could have been cheaper.  They should give printers away for free 'cause the moneys in the toner.
5,I've been very pleased with the quality consistency and reliability of this product.  I also really appreciate how intuitive it is to monitor ink levels and change out empty cartridges.  There's a little light on each one of the cartridges which is a different color (and/or blinks) depending on whether or not it's close to needing a change.  That ensures that when your computer tells you that your ink is low and you open your printer up it's easy to identify which cartridge(s) need to be changed.
5,I‚Äôve gotten these cartridges for my printer for years now and they work great and get the job done!
5,I have a Canon Pixma MG8120 and have been completely happy with its performance combined with authentic Canon ink. It's performed flawlessly and produces amazingly beautiful photo prints on Canon photo paper. I usually buy off-brands in the grocery store but I'm not going to fuss about with off-brand ink--I've read too many bad reviews and warnings. While it's expensive the quality is worth it. When I'm printing everyday things the fast setting is an ink saver and still has great quality.
5,These inks are indeed compatible and work nicely!  When it comes to Canon printers - they only work properly with compatible inks and it's nice to be able to purchase some at somewhat lower costs than in-store.
4,Same comments apply here as my previously stated comments about the Twin Pack Value Pack.  I'd be so much more pleased if those cartridges held more ink... they run out so quickly. A bit cumbersome to release the tab which causes some release of the ink. However it is a consistently good product. Good packaging; arrived quickly!  Thank you.
5,Having the separate Canon colored ink tanks is very efficient compared to the single colored ink tank of my HP printer.  If I printed a lot of Christmas cards with green the whole tank needed to be replaced.  I have just purchased the Canon PIXMA MG6220 and printed at least six dozen high resolution grayscale 8"X10" photos and three dozen colored 4"X6" prints as well as many sheets with text.  Only the gray ink tank had to be replaced so far.
4,I have ordered this item several times before from Amazon. I never had a problem with the Canon ink tanks. They fit very easily in Canon printer and the colors are rich and smooth. The only issue I have as with most people the cost of the ink is a bit on the expensive side but other than that...
5,What can I say. The ink works as advertised. Lovely color in low contrast and high contrast photos and great color presentation in every printing situation.
3,These are Canon ink cartridges so they fit and work perfectly in my Canon PIXMA MG6220 Printer. (Although as an aside to the Canon engineers who designed this printer - who ever heard of a printer where the ink cartridges are so hard to reach?) Anyway the cartridges provide perfect ink flow and lovely colors but as with scores of other printers these bad boys are just suck-your-wallet dry expensive. Based on many stories of blotches and splotches and reams of ruined paper I've avoided refilled and off-brand replacements like the plague. However when ink becomes so expensive that it's cheaper to buy a new printer than to purchase new cartridges something is wrong with this picture.
4,Canon has done a good job in keeping these combination cartridges low in price.  The ink seems to last just as long as the larger ones that I used to use.  I am pleased with the ink quality as well as the color crispness.  Definitely a good buy if you use your canon printer often.
3,I usually buy cartridges at Office Max but they are sooo expensive.  When I found them on Amazon I was thrilled that I could save some decent money!  Unfortunately I didn't realize that this package didn't contain the small black cartridge and I cannot print without it.  I still had to go to Office Max for that cartridge.  I will probably just shop at Office Max from now on because I ended up spending more money AND had to stop what I was doing to make the trip.  My fault but this is the first time I have ever had this problem.  Dot Reed
4,Ink cartridges are ok. Only complaint is that ink does not last long enough. However I have that complaint with all brands of ink cartridges. I buy from Amazon because it is a lot easier than going to a local office supply store. Also price is less expensive than local store.Yes I recommend this product to anyone.
5,Ok. Works as expected
4,This is good ink and I haven't found it cheaper than amazon yet but make sure you buy a chip resetter for these cartridges. (I found mine on amazon). The microchips report to the printer that they are out of ink WAY before they really are. A chip resetter will save you a fortune in ink. :)
3,Not much to say.  They are the correct cartridges for my printer.  Sometimes they seem to last sometimes they run out seeming fast and odd ones too the Cyan or Magenta when most of my printing is Black.  Can't complain too much though as that is the unfortunate nature of this sort of product.  Comes quickly saves me the trouble of going to the store and hoping they have the right ones in stock if they can be found on a veritable wall of choices.  Price seems pretty good compared to the local big boxes.
5,Although the canon printers do sell the individual catridges I recommend buying this pack.Individually you can pick and choose your color but in the end you are going to need all of these cartridges and it's cheaper to buy them this way.The canon printers have been work horse for me and I've had no problem with the printers or the ink just recommend buying the package of cartridges rather than the just the individual ones.
5,I bought a pack of ink cartridges in October 2011 when I purchased a new printer from amazon.com. I went to use the final cartridge left in the pack the large blace one and it did not work. I contacted amazon about getting a replacement or credit for the one cartridge. They sent me another complete package of cartridges at no charge!!! I purchased several items through amazon at Christmas and had to return for replacement. They were SUPER to work with for returns!
5,This Canon printer ink cartridge replacement pack contains four easy-to-use ink containers for your Canon inkjet printer that snap in or out as needed.  The ink itself is good quality well-suited to producing clear sharp photographs and documents.  It is also relatively expensive.  This reviewer wishes Canon offered a five cartridge replacement pack instead of requiring the consumer to do a four-and-one purchase; highly recommended anyway.
5,I had been using the "refillable" cartridges in my MG6120 Canon printer but the "fill level" was never too accurate and a lot of them would not be read by the printer and I would have to discard them.  I went back to OEM and have had no problems since.  The price was right tooMy printer also uses a black and a gray 226 cartridge which have to be bought separately but overall the price is acceptable.
5,I was in the market for replacement cartridges for my MG5220 printer.  My first inclination was to go with a lower priced generic option.  After much thought and recalling my past experience with refills and generics I decided to go with the Canon PGI series cartridges.  These cartridges are top quality installed in a snap (literally) and work perfectly.  Yes you might pay a little more but to me it's worth the piece of mind.  Happy Shopping!
4,There aren't a lot of options for alternatives to these cartridges. They work well but I find that I almost never need to replace all 4 cartridges at once. Buying them individually is too expensive but if you don't then you will end up with too many of one cartridge and not enough of another over time.
4,What can you say about ink?  It is the original Canon brand in the original packaging.  I wish it were cheaper but Amazon has it cheaper than almost anywhere else.  More economical to buy the multi-packs over individual colors.  I prefer the Canon brand and have never had any issues.
4,The price is a little steep I feel but the actual product itself works just fine.  I got it in 1 day (I'm a Prime member) and it just snapped right into my printer and has been working great.  I wish they made larger color inks though as I feel they don't hold that much.
3,I use Brand name ink because I like my printer Pixma MX892. Compatible inks can ruin the print head which costs more than the printer to repair. The quality of printers is deteriorating so don't want to ruin this and have to buy a new one.Instead I do little printing and set my printer on low quality (fast printing) and grayscale (in the print dialogue go to Quality and Media look for place to ck grayscale.You can print a LONG after the printer says low on ink. So keep on printing.
5,Purchased for our printer good price for what you get
5,The problems you might have and the low quality of discounted brands are not worth it. I agree that ink is expensive but the price you pay for these machines nowhere covers the cost unless you paid full retail. It is similar to Playstation I remember reading how much Sony lost on every PS2 they sold that why games are $60.00.I am just happy I have a great printer and can afford to use the right ink.
5,As I am using this ink one cartridge at a time when I need to replace the one that has run out I can't comment on the whole package but so far so good. This is the first time I have owned a Canon printer but after the problems with my last HP All-In-One I decided it was time to change brands.The Canon ink is bright and works very well with my photos. It IS EXPENSIVE but so are most printer inks these days. Amazon prices are about the best I have found for genuine Canon ink.
4,This worked for me when I purchased the 2-pack of the black 226 cartridge in addition to this.  I do a lot of grayscale or black-only printing.
4,This is the OEM (Canon) ink tank for the Canon model MX892 so there is no question as to fit or function of this product in the correct printers.  My only dislike is that Canon way overprices their ink.  When the printer warranty runs out I will switch to a generic ink source.
5,I have a Canon MG-5220 Printer/Scanner for Mac. It works from Lion all the way up to High Sierra. Made by Canon for Canon. I have never had any problems at all with this product.
5,Good price.
4,Much better price than purchasing locally plus the convenience of ordering as soon as I realize ink is running low. The multi pack is also more economical that ordering separately it's like getting one of the cartridges free.
3,Someone did a calculation on ink and what the cost breaks down to turns out to be $4500 a gallon yikes!Now I'm not complaining about the quality of the ink just the price of it I decided to look elsewhere and take a different approachI purchase ink in bottles and bought refillable ink cartridges do a little research on the net for yourself I went with InkOwl hope this helps. I have no ties to the company just a consumer looking to save $$$
2,The ink is good quality but runs out fast (in the MG5220 at least). The combo packages are pretty dumb- Why would you sell a combo pack of this ink yet leave a color out? Oh that's right...money. You say I can purchase the 226 Blk pack and get 50 sheets of paper for $50? DUMB.The inkjet printer game has been a racket since day one and the Canon MG5220 and its ink are no different.UPDATE: January 2nd 2013 - So a year after I purchased this combo pack I am once again back at low ink level warnings. I can count how many color prints I've done this year on one hand (and none of them were photos prints) and maybe 20-30 B&W non-photo prints maximum. So this only confirms my suspicion that the ink dries out too fast (yes a year is too fast-employ a new cartridge method already!) it wouldn't be that big of a deal if it didn't render my entire printer useless even for non color prints. I'm going Epson.
5,I hate my printer because it old and barely works but it's not the inks fault. It has color inside and prints stuff if you don't throw your printer across the room
4,The ink is just as I expected Canon Brand labeled and packaged.  These individual containers are easy to insert but don't last as long as cartridges for my old HP printer did.  Keeping an inventory of five cartridges is a hassle.  I wish there was a package with a black pigment AND the four colors.
5,Learned the hard way using reloaded second hand cartridges on my last printer just sped up the printer's demise. I only buy OEM for this printer and 3 years later the pictures are as good as the one's in the first month! Buy Canon printers if you want solid quality service where you actually speak to a service rep fairly quickly. I buy all my OEM printer cartridges from Amazon.
5,As described
4,Fair price and fast delivery. Great!
2,This order arrived today. Mailing Envelope looked fine but the box looked like it had been kicked around for years. In very bad shape. Hoping the ink is ok and will revise the review if all is well.
5,I know. I know. It's pricey. I get it. But so is buying a new inkjet every year. 90% OF GENERIC INK WILL INEVITABLY CLOG YOUR PRINTER'S NOZZLES! It's a fact that I've learned through years of repairing these things professionally and unfortunately also through personal experience... If you spend a little extra dough on the good stuff your printer will print the way you expect it to. That's it!
3,This package arrived with out the small black ink cartridge and without it the printer will not work althoughthe large black ink cartridge was installed.  Did not know that the large cartridge was included instead of the small one.  It is a big error on Canon's part just so they could have a more competitive price on the package but myprinter just will not work without all five (5) cartridges installed.  So now must place another order and wait toprint bulletins for church which were not done last Sunday and now maybe not this coming Sunday.
5,Fits perfect.  Color quality great.
3,These ink cartridges will give you solid color for your documents and photographs but they are rather expensive for the capacity they have. I stopped printing in color as I could not afford these cartridges anymore. I was printing journal articles weekly to read for a class which did a number on the black ink as well. I am more concerned with the color than with the black ink. This ink cartridge's capacity issue was part of the reason that I switched printers.
5,I tried some cheaper stuff and it worked ok BUT ... I had problems with my printhead and the nozzles gooped up and yuk. I bought a new Canon printer and now use only Canon inks. The photos look great and NO problems from my printer. So it cost a few bucks more ... what the hey I'm worth it and so are my pictures.
4,Have bought it over 3 times now produc is as stated and works with my printer. Wish it was a prime product.
4,I would have given this 5 stars but I guess it may have beenmy oversight but thought that it had all the ink in box that printer needed.Doesn't include the thin black ink needed just the large one.Otherwise it's the best value than in any store!
4,These ink cartridges work well and the price is lower than in-store but I can't give the product 5-stars because I think ink is way over-priced no matter where you buy it. It's highway robbery for a bit of coloured fluid that doesn't last long.
5,Awesome!
4,Amazon has the best prices on this part # for Cannon printer cartridges.. I have Office Depot Rewards but Amazon's price beats Office Depot's prices even after adding in the rewards discount. Rated 4 stars because the printer that uses this cartridge goes through a lot of ink.
5,I need to get more but there is still plenty of yellow. On top of that I've still got a full unopened yellow cartridge. Anyway these worked great in my Canon printer.
5,Order arrived as promised and in good condition. I am areturning customer for this value pack of canon inktanks. Since I purchased my new canon pixma printerI like to have the colored ink tanks on hand whenneeded to replaced.  Good Price. Will be back to reorder again as long as Amazon keeps this productavailabe to the amazon and canon customers!!  Thanks Amazon
5,The original ink cartridges lasted quite a while (since November and 2 of them haven't run out yet). I like that this printer takes separate color cartridges and I like that you can buy them in a collective pack; that is very convenient. The cartridges are easy to change and the ink is very nice as printer ink goes! The price is very competitive to my local Office Depot and Office Max.
5,OEM cartridge at a good price.  I used to buy my ink at Costco but these are less expensive and I usually receive them within a couple of days of ordering (even before I became a Prime member.)  It's hard to improve on that.
5,I have yet to have a problem purchasing printer ink off Amazon. I use ONLY new sealed brand name ink cartridges. I have never had a dry cartridge or any other problems. Amazon is nearly always the cheapest place but not by more than a couple dollars. The value packs are not necessarily a value either so check the pricing for singles and multiples carefully.
5,With gas prices rising and the cost of "time" driving it's nice to get Canon quality ink for a good value shipped for free.I do wish they would put the gray 226 in the package because it's hard to find.  Other than that this is a good value for Canon ink and I"m very pleased with both the Canon ink and the Canon printer/scanner/copiers in general.
4,... My printer goes through this ink too quickly. This is my printer's fault not the fault of the ink. The black ink seems tobe reasonably color fast. The colored inks perform  reasonably on fabric treated with a bubble jet solution.
5,Genuine OEM Canon Inks are the only things I use in my Canon photo printers that I actually print photos on. As always I'm never disappointed with genuine Canon products. The price is higher than aftermarket products of course but I'd not mind even if the OEM was double the price of the other guys
5,I liked the price.
4,OK don't have the printer any more.
5,Perfect Ink for my  printer
5,Everytime I use generic ink in the past the printer stops working.  I only use Canon in my Canon printer now.  Great price and fast service.  The price at Costco for the same pack is about double.  And I do not have to put up with the traffic.
3,This ink is a must for anyone who owns the MG8220.  The printer requires 6 ink cartriges and these 4 are the primary color ones.  The ink produces vivid and colorful pictures that are frame-worthy and on the right paper can stand up to wear and tear for a long time.  I recommend this ink for anyone who's printer is still under warranty.  If you're out of warranty look for the refillable cartriges to save on cost.  A 6-pack replacement can cost as much as $75
5,It cost a 3rd of the purchase price of our printer to replace the set of ink cartridges.The tanks are small. They come in a padded larger box I guess to make you feel like you are getting a better deal.This ink is the same as the stuff that comes in your printer so quality is as good as it gets.
4,This 4 color value pak does a good job in the Canon iP4820 printer although not in an extraordinary manner. I find that I need to have an extra PGBK 225 black tank because in my circumstance I run out of black ink before the color inks included in the value pak.
2,Grossly overpriced ink - once you get a Canon printer you are a slave to rip-off prices for ink.  The makers should be ashamed but I'm sure they are not.  The price on Amazon was competitive however.
4,Good
5,Canon ‚Äúsaviors‚Äù in a small box great when that ink emergency hits. Real thing buy with confidence. Handy to have on hand.
5,I have noticed that there are other similar printer cartridge refills for a cheaper price but to get the name brand refills for the same price or a little bit cheaper than the knock off refills that is a deal you cannot pass up! These refills work great for my Canon Pixma wireless printer and I am glad that I purchased them from Amazon!
5,My printer produces beautiful full color photos and the other printer functions are equally the best. Unfortunatelyit also uses a lot of  ink. That ink is expensive. Amazon is the only source I have found that gives me the Canonproduced ink for a cheaper price. They are also the only source in my remote area that delivers my supplies in two days.
2,I've had my Canon printer for 6 years.  It has always worked well and is still working great.  I get the pricing game that printer companies play - they sell you a cheap printer and make a killing on the ink over the life of the printer.  But Canon has gone too far now with the price of replacement ink.  I am going to invest in a printer with much larger ink tanks to save money on ink but I can't go with Canon. They have sucked enough money out of me.
5,Same as store bought
5,Ink is long lasting.  However I have to purchase more frequently due to printer will not work when one of the ink cartridges are empty.  It is a printer issue.  To get around this I purchase extra ink cartridges.
4,I purchased those cheaper ones in print pal as recommended by a colleagueunfortunately they didn't fit. W/o any choice I needed to go back to the expensive Canon original cartridges. The deliver arrived quick and well packed together with another item. Thank you amazon.
3,Bought for my Canon Pixma printer.  It contains the large inkwell and the three smaller CMY color cartridges.  Good value for the money; my only complaint (and it is more of a nitpick but that's just now I am) is that I would have paid a few bucks more to have the BLACK 226 extra black ink cartridge that my printer takes be part of this combo.  I'll have to buy that separately I suppose.
5,There are cheaper alternative inks that will work but why risk damaging a printer? This stuff works with no risk. I used the cheaper ones on my last printer and had some issues. The printer only lasted 3 years. The one I have now I would like to keep a lot longer. Maybe it is a matter of luck. I don't trust luck. That is just me.
5,This is an excellent deal much cheaper than the box stores. But I always have to order the additional black ink cartridge #226 as well. I don't know why it's just not included in this pkg. But item always arrives promptly and I ordered it twice now for my printer. Very satisfied with the product.
5,Inks have gotten out of control price wise.  This was a little better then other places
4,not happy with any off brands wished it had small black to
1,I get so irritated at these cartridges telling me they are empty based solely on the date they were installed instead of how much I actually used them. I can replace the ink tanks print almost nothing for a few months and then when I go to print something it will say the tanks are empty and need replacing and could damage the printer if I continue to use it without replacing them. Also I can replace all cartridges at once print EVERYTHING in grayscale for weeks and the printer will still show that my color levels are going down/going empty along with the black levels. Lies!!! Foul lies!!! I bought a Canon printer because I heard they were not as bad with making you replace ink tanks before they are actually empty but it simply is not true. HP was worse but this is still bad enough that I will be looking at other brands next time I buy a printer.
5,I was looking for an inexpensive way to purchase these color cartridges. I'm not a power user when it comes to printing so paying top dollar for the original cartridges doesn't appeal to me.These arrived on time and were as easy to load as the original. I'll have to update this review when it comes to a discussion as to how long they last.
4,they work great still way to expensive canon is high with there ink refills
4,Just wished the prices were lower.  Migrated from an HP to the Canon MX 882.  Love it.  If you find lower prices let me know.  I know refills are cheaper but had some bad experiences.
3,For $45 I would like ALL the inks I need but this set is missing the skinny black - CLI-226.  It includes the fat black - CLI-225.  My Canon PIXMA printer will not run if one of the two blacks is empty.  Very annoying combination pack!!  Still I have had less problems with Canon inks then the generics dispite the high cost and combo pack that is missing an ink.
4,No problem w/ the seller or the product.
3,I'd have rated this higher but for the price. The inks are fine and both print and photos come out looking well. The only issue I have is paying more than half the price of a new printer for replacement ink. It's not just Canon but all of the ink manufacturers. I just don't believe it costs that much to manufacture. Of course I certainly could be wrong.
4,great ink with great quality. it does the job since i do graphic design for decals fliers posters and photos. bought an extra set because i use do alot of work and i love this product alot. thank you
5,It comes in an unnecessarily colorful package which contain items I must have if I'm to print anything.  It would be great if there were cheaper plain packs of this stuff.  I do prefer to stick with the manufacturer's product rather than an aftermarket seller even though I'm sure it could be sold cheaper.
3,Even after identifying my printer's model number in the search it provided this product which comes 4 instead of the 5 cartridges that my printer requires.  The product that I received is great quality just the wrong pkg for my printer.
4,Competitive price and very convenient having it come right to my front door. Thank goodness for Amazon. I am just about ready to install it as I am eeking out the very last of the current cartridges.
4,They work ok but don't last long. I hardly ever print at home. Once I print it seems like the next time I print the levels have dropped. They last just a few months of once-a-month small print jobs.
5,I like shopping on Amazon for my ink cartridges. They always have it on stock and checking for the right cartridges is easy on Amazon.  Just click on the Make and model of printer you own then a list of compatible ink cartridges appears.  The price and quality are great.  What more do you need?
5,The product is of good quality and works great in my printer. What I liked the least is that replacement ink in general is expensive.
3,So the ink itself is fine.  The problem I have is my Canon printer requires all 3 colors of the 226 ink the large black 225 ink AND a smaller black 226 ink.  The latter is not included in this value pack.  No sooner did I get the ink and install it that the black 225 ran out and I was back to not being able to print.
5,I use my Pixma iP4900 for projects where I am concerned about producing quality printed products.  I prefer OEM cartridges because they produce better color fidelity.  I use after market cartridges on an older printer for projects where high quality is not as important.  For my main printer I only use Canon branded cartridges.
5,I needed to replace the ink in my printer got what I ordered and all is well.
4,Runs out fast
4,It is what it is and it does what it's supposed to do.  My printer needs ink and this is the kind it uses. ONLY PROBLEM is I still have to buy the 226 black separately.
4,I always use the Canon inks with my present Canon printer.  I often used knockoffs on my previous Canon printer which I feel shortened its life.
5,while this printer sucks more ink than the past I like buying my ink on amazon as their prices are competitive with the refill places in town and I know I am getting genuine canon ink which produces better colors.  Just wish they had a pack with the one ink tank that this was missing.
5,These are real Canon replacements. Came well packaged and for best price I could find
4,I have only used Canon ink in my Canon printer. I don't know of another brand of ink that is better or as good to use in a Canon printer. I've been pleased with Canon inks. I do of course as with most printer inks wish they lasted longer!
5,OK printer inks are too expensive but I decided not to take a star off for that.  I have never had any problems with genuine Canon inks and although the inks are too expensive Amazon offered a great price (comparatively) for this box.
5,i love all canon products they real good  that 's why i keep buying them. never has a problem anything.
5,Buen precio por una tinta de calidad.
5,I bought these after I gave up on generics which give only fair quality and often don't quite fit (and if the contacts don't line up are completely unusable.) These work well and aren't significantly shorter-lived than the cheap ones. Money CAN buy relief from headaches and lost time.
4,Good product very expensive. generic brand better and much much cheaper...
5,Right on!!!  The only reason I see making a purchase at a big box store would be for the need of NOW rather than waiting on shipping.  However $25 !!!!  I will wait and plan my future purchase accordingly so that I don't run out and face the NOW situation.
1,I blindly ordered this color combo thinking that I was going to be able to replace my ink and continue to be able to print from home rather than just using company ink.  I was wrong.  Do not use amazons printer ink search function.  Go into your printer and find out for yourself exactly what you need.  This product only replaces the 3 color cartridges and 1 of the 2 black cartridges.  Guess what happens when you run out of the one that you don't have a replacement for.  You guessed right.  You can't print.  Even though the larger black ink which is included in this combo and is used for printing text vice pictures does not allow you to print if the other is empty.  There is no way to bypass this via the printing software either.  Unfortunately Canon ripped me off and I now have to spend another $13 on black ink which is included in the 5 pack verses the 4 pack.  Thanks Canon.
4,Worked as expected
5,It is a very good ink pack so long as you buy Canon's OEM inkjets. The only disappointing aspect is of this package of inkjets is that you have to buy the gray inkjet separately as Canon does not offer the CLI-226 Grey/gray in its combo packs.
4,I just wanted ink - this is what I needed & I am satisfied with this product.  Canon ink for a Canon printer makes sense to me.  It was delivered in a timely manner & is working fine.
3,Genuine Canon Ink expensive compatible  long delivery time.My printer couldn't wait the whole 11 days it took to deliver before running out so I had to buy some locally. It was the same price!No brainer next time I need some ink.
4,Good way to but ink for your Cannon printer.  it is cheaper this way.  My gripe is with Cannon.  My printer uses 6 ink cartridges.  The gray cartridges isn't part of any value pack.
5,Pros: fits worksCons: price.After searching around I found Amazon to have the best prices. But the price variation was minimal. Ink cartridges are the 'small print' of the printer world. Tip: always check out the cost of the ink before you decide to purchase a printer!Hope that helps
5,I used to buy refilled ink cartridges but destroyed my last printer doing that so now it's OEM for me all the way.  Canon ink cartridges seem to last much longer than the HP ink cartridges I used in my previous HP printer which makes me and my pocket book very happy.
5,TIMELY DELIVERY . ORIGINAL CANNON INK CARTRIDGES ARRIVED ON TIME . I WILL BUY FROM THE SUPPLIER AGAIN  MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA TO SELL AS A PACK OF TWO WITH ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT SINCE THE INK RUNS OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY IF YOU ARE HAVING FUN PRINTING ON THE CANNON  MX 892 !!
1,This is not a criticism of the ink (which is ok) but of Canon.  My PIXMA printer will clear the head of every cartridge at every opportunity -- even when only one cartridge has been replaced and/or when the printer is set for B&W printing.  This has been done deliberately to waste as much ink as possible.  They could as easily have arranged to print a test page first before clearing heads and giving the user the option to clear only the head or heads that needed clearing.  Of course if the printer is set to B&W the color cartridges should be idled entirely.  Even after a cold startup the first step should be a test print with individualized head clearing at the owner's choice.  I consider Canon's programming tantamount to theft.  And this applies to the other manufacturers as well.  They give away the printer then rob you on the ink for years to come.
5,These cartridges and easy to use.  They open without problem.  The colors are true.  The variety is good - leaves you with a spare of all colors but the gray (at least I need a gray too).  I always recommend original equipment ink cartridges - never cause a printer problem.
5,We have a Canon wireless printer.  Amazon is the easiest way for me to purchase.
5,Cannon 4 Pack is perfect for my printer.  Easy to install.I intend to order this product again when I need it.
4,Great inks...I just wish they weren't so expensive!
4,I expected an ink package as pictured but it came in 4 separate individual boxes.  All original Canon ink though.  A good deal for the price.
3,My Canon MG 5520 eats these things like a crack addict smokes crack. It's a bottomless money pit and and my printer is never satisfied. Want to print black and white? Nope... My MG 5520 will hold my paper hostage because the yellow cartridge is low. Fill Yellow and I will let you have your black and white college print paper.
4,Product is very good..  Will continue to purchase on line as long as the price stays good as well
5,I bought this as the price was right for 'brand' ink whichI use exclusively. I always have had Canon and I love them.I go to friends homes where they have 'brand xyz' andthey are always having issues.I have never had an issue and I prefer the consistencyof the 'brand' ink.
5,This is a great product for the Canon MG8120B.
5,I like purchasing my ink cartridges from Amazon due to the reliability of the product. The cartridges last longer than other companies product that I have purchased in the past on-line. Plus the value is awesome!  I can always rely on the quality of this product when purchased from Amazon.
5,Canon original ink cartridges are top quality. i have tried refilled cartridges but they can't compare to the originals.
5,I like that they fit my printer and work well. I do not like the high price.
5,The Canon PGI-225 seems to last longer than I expected.  I still wish it lasted even longer sincethis is a big expenditure in maintaining my printer.  I don't understand why the ink is so expensivein relationship to the cost of the printer itself.  But overall I have been very pleased with the product.
3,I bought this to use in my new Canon printer the first time new cartridges were needed.  They worked just fine however are quite pricey so I now use The Printer Filling Station.com  Their products are excellent and at about 1/2 the cost of Canon.  I don't have to feel budget constraints in printing several copies of a family cookbook project.
4,I want to thank you for pricing the ink so a 87 year old man who is retired and is on SS and likes to learn how to use a computer. Thanks again.
5,product was as described and showed up on time; no complaints here; keep up the good work :)
5,I do a lot of color printing on both DVDs and glossy paper. I played around with the settings between standard and best quality on a glossy DVDs and paper I can report that there really wasn't that much difference. So I am going to stick with the Standard printing to save on ink!
5,Love this ink!! I pay a little more to get the great photos I need!!  Love this and would use no other!!
5,ink lasts long
4,Not a whole lot to say about ink except it's expensive but necessary if you need to print.  This value pack was what I needed so that's what I bought.
5,Have used this product for approximately three years. Excellent results but pricey. I love my Canon MX882 all in one printer. Much better the the HP that I previously had.
5,I don't know what the difference is between this pack and the one I usually buy at Staples but it has lasted longer than the ones I have bought from them plus I have printed more pictures since I got this value pack and still have plenty of ink left. Couldn't be happier!
5,Pay the extra for the proper stuff. The off brand imitation let's the ink bleed a little so text is not as crisp as the Canon ink. Also these do not leak on opening like the off brand
4,good and fast delivery
5,Pricing is competitive and I use this for (2) existing Canon printers - never had a problem.
5,This Canon package has exactly what I want. I do a fair amount of color printing both photos and regular printing. Color is clear and cartridges last a long time. I won't settle for any other brand of ink.
4,Still too expensive.
4,Have purchased this many times and only problem I have with the ink is it uses all the ink even in black only printing.
4,Good for the printer bad for the pocket.  It's archaic that we have to spend so much for printer ink but this set always works well in our Cannon printer.
4,I used to buy compatible replacement ink cartridges for my last printer which is now being disassembled by sub-minimum wage children somewhere in China. Do yourself and the world a favor and spring for the real deal.
3,High quality but pricey proprietary inks. Having said that the pricing at Amazon is better than what can be found at big box and membership warehouses. If you want to print photos printer manufacturer inks are necessary to get the highest quality and hopefully archival results that will last a lifetime
5,High quality and cheap we use it so good.
4,As advertised this ink works with my printer.  It would be great if it lasted longer but it gets the job done. Still waiting for a solid smudge proof inkjet but I guess that is called laser.
5,I am very pleased with the service I have gotten when I order from Amazon.com.  Recently my printer was out of ink cartridges and since I live in a small town I couldn't replace them around here.  I went online and ordered them from Amazon.com and received them in just a short time.
4,The 4 pack of ink cartridges was a great buy and I am enjoying using them.  My pictures look really professional with my new canon 4 pack value pack.  Thank you!
4,I returned the package because I bought another printer and this ink was not appropriate for the new machine.
2,Not that I don't like the ink --- the printer I have MC892 holds the PGBK as well as the BK and they are both ink 226.  I bought this pack because the heading said TGI-225BK Black but the picture of the box is the box that came and it did not have BK which I needed it has PGBK. Now the printer does not go as the BK is empty and that means I need to re-order and wait again.
5,I would like to give it a lower rating only because of the ridiculous price that ink commands although Canon ink is a little cheaper than some.  I have to give it a 5 because the print quality is great and the photo prints are awesome.
5,great product from canon never tried aftermarket yet. delivered and performed as always no issues.
5,Works and performs perfect for my Canon MG 6220 printer. Keep in mind that this package does not contain the smaller/skinnier black ink cartridge as well as the gray ink cartridge. Those two will need to be ordered separately.
4,I only use Canon ink with my Canon printer but the only issues I have are the cartridges are too small and run out of ink quick and the price is higher than most other brands.
4,Factory catridges.  A little pricey but they all are.  Good packaging easy installation.  I have the MX882 printer purchased to replace an HP Inkjet all-in-one.  Best one I have ever had.  I will never buy another HP product.
5,This is of course the brand name ink cartridge(s) for Canon so there is not much to say - they work perfectly my office has no complaints.  We do love the convenience of ordering online instead of having to drive to an office supply store.
5,Bought for my Canon MX892 and so far they have lasted me a couple of months with printing college papers and the like. If you have the same model printer you also need to get the 226 blank cartridge as without it the printer will not print.
5,This is a good deal and whenever I run out of ink I never buy it in the store in fact sometimes this one is hard to find it is just too easy to click my mouse and within a couple of days it is here I love it!
5,I find the ink quality is equal to over-the-counter purchases and the pricing is better.  The ink arrived so quickly that there was little to no inconvenience as determined by your need.  If you order before you are completely out of ink there is no inconvenience.
4,Originally I was disappointed that I had not noticed this set doesn't include the small black cartridge but after buying that cartridge separately this still turned out to be a fair bargain.
5,I was very happy with the quick shipping and have not had any problems with the OEM ink. I have tried off brand inks before that continuously clogged up or dried out too quickly and found that it's worth the money just to buy OEM ink.
3,It came fast but it did not have the small black the 226. Check your printer first it you need all cartridges then find the box with them all now I still have to buy the 226 not good
5,I have bought these for years and I am always happy with their quality and how long they last.  Great product.
5,OEM ink - spendy but works well
3,Missing Gray that's the downfall.  When you have a color  printer you need a full compliment  of cartridges.
4,It doesn't get five stars as it costly.  Whether this cost is justifiable I am not qualified to say. I shall keep ordering because of the dependable reaults
5,Like
5,These tanks are very easy to use and conveniently have a red LED on the bottom that blinks when ink is low.  This makes it easier to see which ones need replacing when the top is up on the printer; otherwise the tanks would be in shadow and hard to see.
1,I thought I'd try to save some money and buy a "used like new" ink cartridge refill.The first tank I opened spilled a small amount of ink onto my hand.  No big deal.  I thought I just needed to be more careful next time.This morning I opened the 225 black and the ink spilled again but this time it was more than a little bit. Thank goodness I had a pile of junk in front of the printer otherwise it would have been all over our beige carpet.  It also pretty much covered my left hand and half of my right hand.  Of course I was on my way out the door for work so I had to pour straight bleach on my hands to make them presentable.  I'm a nurse so just a minor detail right?Would not recommend this product.  I have never had any problems with the new cartridges.
5,This is exactly what I needed for my Canon MG5320 printer. I have purchased this 225 black and 226 3 color kit before and they worked perfectly and lasted a  long time.
5,Very good price for this.  I only use genuine Canon ink and cartridges.  I've learned from my past mistakes of using other inexpensive substitute ink......gums up the printer and makes a mess.  Never again
5,I buy all my canon ink from Amazon.  The prime delivery ensures I get it within two days.  The price is very good.  Canon makes good ink cartridges and I go thru a lot of cartridges.
5,Worked great just a bit a leakage from one of the cartridges no biggy. Also be careful because this may not come with all the cartridges needed. I needed another smaller black which you can buy separately though you cannot print until all are somewhat full.
5,Exactly what I needed for which colors I was running low on at the moment.  After using a "replacement" brand once I now always go with original Canon cartridges.  Excellent price and service too.
3,Quality isn't really the issue with these cartridges but if you print a lot they don't tend to last very long despite a pretty high price.  But I destroyed my previous HP Printer with refilled cartridges that leaked so I feel obligated buying these instead of more economical refilled cartridges or generic ones.
5,What can I say...it's Ink...it fits in my printer....it prints when I tell it to...Wish the bundle or set of cartridges also contained Gray which you strangely have to order separately
5,very satisfied with ink cartridges... work fine in my HP Officejet Pro 8600
5,Exactly what we needed
4,Good ink but holy Jesus is it expensive
5,Set up was a cinch and it prints beautifully.  After three HP printers in succession that all had carriage jams on initialization I decided to try this Canon my first one ever. I am so pleased!!  I did not need a fax so the scan and copy features were fine for me.
5,I think this is a good deal for the price and it shipped fast. I wish that it came with both black inks though because my printer has a spot for XL and reg. size and if one of them is out it won't work.
1,I ordered this ink from Amazon for my Canon iX6320 printer to be on the safe side when I volunteered to run a photo booth at my daughter's elementary school. The printer has a large capacity black cartridge and four smaller cartridges for cyan magenta yellow and black. This package comes with the big black cartridge and the small cartridges for C M and Y. Even if the printer has a full large black cartridge it will give you and error message if the small black cartridge is empty. All the materials on the page show the 5 cartridges but the package does not contain the small black cartridge. So my printer failed. This is a total rip-off and a massive fail.
4,As the heading says the quality has been maintained.  I do wish one received more for one's money but such is the state of commerce in today's world.
5,Replacement part for Canon printer
5,As is the case every time that is a Canon product it is as good as can be.  That means that the lowest price is the best buy on this product.  Amazon is pretty consistently the low price on this item.
4,and decent price. Needed 3 of the 4 colors and the 4th one will need a change soon. So this worked out well and the proce was the best I found for all of them.
5,This is genuine Canon ink at a bargan price. Amazon was about one half of what the ink would have cost me locally. I have had some good success with generic ink but you can not beat the real thing. Perfect photos and dark black text.Piedpiper46
5,Canon inkjets for Canon printers are a must.  Don't fool around with imitations or "refills".  It isn't cheap to print from your home computer but it is cheaper than having it done professionally and redone & redone because the color is off.
1,you all know we buy this item because it is compatible with the printer. is it good? yes might be good Is it the best product for your printer? No is not the best product for your printer. it does n`t allow us to refill the thank very expensive and the orange seal caps are made to break so no one can used them again. just so you know... You can Modify this Original Canon Cartridges to be able to refill them with your own ink. Why you want to refill them yourself? Because for the same price as you are buying this product you can get 4 bottles of ink that allows you to refill this tanks up to 14 times or as many times you want. yes.. Same price you get more.do research in google and you will find a lot of instructions for this type of projects.
5,These refills work very well in my printer.  I wish they would last longer.  The color cartridges don't seem to last very long even though most of my printing is done in black only. I will continue to purchase this product.
3,The ink you get works well but there is no mini black ink cartridge replacement.As soon as my small black ink cartridge ran out my printer stopped printing in color even though the large ink was still full.If this box had the small black ink cartridge it would be perfect.
4,This would be a 5 star review if the ink lasted longer! Not Amazon's fault it's Canon's! Will have to check out BEFORE I but another printer how rapidly the ink is used!
5,Working on my doctorate isn't always black and white...  Fortunately I can fire off a cannon for some color.
5,Always purchase authentic canon ink for the Pixma Canon printer I have at the store.  I don't want to have ANY problems with my printer like I have had with other printers when I don't use authentic ink!!!!  Good price also!!!
4,Very satisfactory as I knew it would be. Canon ink is an excellent product and I have always used it with my Canon printers. However it is overpriced in my opinion.
5,The cartridges work perfectly in my printer. Shipping was super fast and I'm very pleased with print quality. I don't print often so the cost of the manufacturer refills vs generic doesn't bother me. It's well worth not having to worry about spills streaks or other problems.
4,we've always been pleased with the canon inks just not always the prices this time price was a little better than last time
4,I buy these just to keep on hand because you never know when you will be out of a certain color of ink. Easy replacement since they are original factory cartridges.
5,seriously they must be made with magic or some sort of wizardry. i use my printer for school and work and these things kick ass then chew bubble gum. and since it cant chew bubble gum you understand that all it does is kick ass.
5,Product as usual was easy to order arrived undamaged in a short time as advertised.Product has performed flawlessly in my printer.I have used these cartridges for over two years ever since purchasing my printer and will continue to do so.
2,It's not the ink it's the printer.  This is the best place to buy replacement ink as it's definitely the least expensive.  But you might as well have a set waiting in your cart & just go ahead & get one every time you make an Amazon purchase because you'll need it & need it fast.  The cartridges look big but they apparently don't hold much & the printer demands new ink frequently even with light use.  Now after a year & a half & a brand new $50 set of ink cartridges the printer head is shot.  And the dead printer holds $50 of useless ink.
5,I've used Epson printers forever in my design business and I was hesitant to switch but Canon Pixma has won my heart. Tthe cost of ink jet cartridges is insane so I was pleasantly surprised to find this deal on a Canon inks for my printer. I'm saving money already!
5,I have to purchase this ink for my Canon printer.  This item arrived new and worked fine.  Ink is excellent as expected.  Convenient purchase and I know I saved purchasing online.  Would buy again from this website.
5,I have had very good luck with this item.  I ordered it and it came almost immediately in the mail.I will order it again before the ink runs out.  It is easy to install in my printer.
5,Great price for the product - nothing beats the quality of the original manufacturer's cartridges.  Other compatible products almost always have problems: leaking or arrive half full or the ink runs everywhere when the twist cap is removed. I recommend using the OEM cartridges.
5,Used on a Canon MG8120 printerr
4,Delivery great price WAY too much.  Also needed to get help with getting through the checkout process (and i made my living as a successful systems analyst/programmer!)
5,Inks are always true to color and are easy to replace.  Wish they were not quite so pricy but all good inks seem to be  and I haven't had good luck with cheap or refilled ones.
5,Once you buy the razor you gotta buy the blades--and that is where the money is.  So found good quality blades at a very good price with free shipping with Prime membership.  Is cloud sharing like a beard?
4,Canon ink and cartridges function very well however my Cannon MG6120 ink-jet printer goes through the ink very fast.  That being said I am quite satisfied with the product.
3,The reason for my lower rating is the magenta cartridge had a plastic piece broken.  I had to take it off the old one and kind of jerry-rig it to make it lock in.  I did not expect that.  Otherwise I am find with the purchase.
4,My Canon printer uses these cartridges and they work well.
5,Ordered my Cannon printer ink online for the first time. I did this mostly for convenience and because it was less expensive than in the usual store where I buy it. The product arrived quickly and was just exactly what I ordered. I will be doing this again.
3,Ink is a racket
5,This was my second purchase of the 4 pack Value Pack.  They work great.  It would be an even greater buy if the 4 value pack came with the gray cartridge making it a 5 pack value pack.
2,Loose Cartridges - not in boxNo box just loose cartridges. Doesn't make me feel very confident about them being original / real Canon brand. They do appear to be Canon brand...but they were advertised to be original in a box and that is not what I was sent.
2,when I recieved the first order and installed two of the cartridges I noticed an error on the printer then I noticed they had sent 221 / 222 (the wrong cartridges) which fit but were not for my printer. I sent them back with no issues and quickly recieved the replacements. BUT after installing those my Cannon 800 takes 5 (It has two black cartridges one is the 225 and there is also a 226 blk)Granted I should pay more attention to what I need to order but you would think that a "pack" for my printer would have had all the cartridges needed for replacement.Amazon's service was fantastic though very impressed.
5,I bought this so when the ink that comes with the printer runs out I will have the replacements.  I like the fact that the colors are seperated requiring only replacement of one color.  So far the printer works great.
5,Real Canon-branded ink not a 3rd party knockoff.  You get what you pay for; a bit more expensive but it's real Canon
5,Nothing unusual here.  This is a Canon product and they have always worked well for me.  More important is that I received the packages the second day after ordering from Amazon.
5,Cheaper than any store I have ever found. It works great for my Cannon printer and lasts much longer than the non branded ink. I buy this often and the price is much cheaper than the stores.
4,This is ink. Not much to say about ink. These fit my printer. Canon printer suck ink dry very quickly. All that being said good price from a good vendor with good responsive delivery.
4,Delivery was on time product as described.Will probably do it again since I do not print that much color and do not want to risk clogging things up with aftermarket ink.
5,This on line order came quickly and at a better price than walking into Walmart.  Which helps a lot since my printer uses ink too fast if I pay strict attention to the printer alerts at the bottom of my screen.
5,Canon ink is the only ink I use.  It preforms exactly as it should.  I never have to worry about any defects.  The package arrives in good condition and precisely when it says it will.
5,My Canon printer works perfect using original ink. I tried generics but I had issues with the color. The pack is an excellent value. I'm running low & order from Amazon & ink arrives the next day. Service is awesome!
3,Expensive inks.  They seem to work fine with my printer because I don't need to clean the injectors often  and you can still print in black and white with an empty colored cartridge though.Sadly the printer model for these inks uses a lot of ink so you spend a lot of money in this item.
4,it's ink--it works with the printer.  The color is good and the printer eats it up like candy--that's all I have to say about that
4,I have bought 3 of these packs and have not encountered any problems with them. They are perfect and the printer works fine using them.
4,This was the lowest price I have come across for the four pack Canon ink cartridges.Worthy value and savings comparable to other retailers.
5,Good ink. Never lasts long enough  something‚Äôs always blinking
4,Nothing wrong with the ink and the price; better priced than our local stores.
4,Quick delivery and the item was exactly what I expected.
5,Good
4,Easy to install Works as advertised. Just so expensive to print on inkjets. This price is about as good as I can find
5,Just ink for my printer.
4,Obviously I need ink to run my computer but instead of 4 inks I'd like to see a package containing ALL inks that are needed with my printer
5,Very Good item. Exactly as described A ++ Will buy again.
4,Good
3,This ink is fine with good quality. My complaint isn't the ink so much as the high price of ink and the rate at which most printers I've had consume it. My Canon 6220 is no exception. With very limited use it sucked up several cartridges in no time at all.
4,Pretty basic cartridges - I have to have them for my printer and Amazon offers the best price around.
5,I have bought these ink cartridges . several times and I highly recommend them!
5,Pretty good color rendition and the larger black cartridge is great for day to day printing.  This is also a low cost printer that can do Apple airprint if you happen to have an apple ipad or iphone.
5,Does the job as always.  It is not a generic brand that brims out of ink quickly !  It works well and last long.  I don't change out my cartridges until they are completely out of ink.
2,I purchased this multipack earlier this year and just opened it. It is missing the 225 PGBK cartridge and had an extra 226 yellow cartridge instead. I have purchased this previously without incident.
4,I was pleased with the price but I haven't determined the life of the ink tanks yet. I would however buy this value pack again.
5,I actually dislike my printer greatly.  It requires changing cartridges too often.  I only do student work on my computer and the cartridges cost runs up during the school year.  These cartridges are a good price.
4,Same old ink....I sure wish it weren't so expensive but at least I know the cartidges will always work in my Canon printer.
4,I wonder why it didn't include the large black. Otherwise a great product and packaging . I will return to buy same product from same merchant for as long as I need it. Am impressed.
4,The product is exactly what I wanted and expected and arrived on time.  It's not 5 stars because Ink is just TOO dang expensive overall.
3,Good and solid cartridges. But highly overpriced (like all printer ink) and a ridiculous multi-cartridge design of the printer itself makes it very confusing to order these things. Buying several colors in bulk helps with the headache of ordering these again once one color is out.
4,it is orignal pack. and it is expense too. I bought is because I bought new print one month ago and i do not want to mess up my printer.
5,I have a Canon PIXMA printer and have only used Canon brand ink replacements for it. It may cost a small bit more but I can always count on true color from this ink.
5,These inks work fine in my Pixma MX892 printer which may be obvious because they are the inks of the printer manufacturer.  I have had a couple of disasters with "compatible" inks and now prefer to spend the extra money.
5,As advertised!
4,Would give this ink 5 stars except for the expense. Could you please give us a break on the price?
4,all ink cartridges last pretty much the same  This ink is good quality and doesn't cost much cause I use my rewards to purchase it!
2,I am warning you to pay attention to your printer's needs in terms of print cartridges when ordering this item. My printer [Canon IP 4820] requires [4] 226 cartridges and a 225 cartridge. This item only has four of the required cartridges. You do not get the 226 black. I did not pay attention when ordering. Do not make the same mistake or you will have run out in the middle of your print job to Staples or similar store and pay approx 15 dollar for the additional cartridge. Have not used the cartridges in this pack yet I am assuming they are like the usual Canon cartridges.
5,very pleased with the price; cheaper than I could find elsewhere at the time.Arrived in timely fashion (but could have used less packaging. arrived in a box about 8 times this size).will buy here again in the future
4,The colors and performance are fine.  It's just that the cartridges run out very quickly but you have to live with it.
4,Canon printer ink 4 pack PGI-225 BK / CLI -226 4530B008 CMY prints clear vibrant colors. Unlike someunknown brands. I highly recommend this ink pack.
5,The ink arrived on time and did every thing I expected of it. They are easy to install -- the color is excellent -- doesn't bleed on the paper and dries as fast as it prints -- no smearing!!
5,This is a great value.  I use it in my Canon printer and have been very pleased with it.  I always buy the Value Pack because I save money with it and the colors are great.
4,All inkjet ink is overpriced but among sources this is the real Canon ink at competitive price.  Best to buy from a reliable source like Amazon.com.
5,This is the 3rd time I have ordered these genuine replacement value packs this is one of the only ways to try to save on overly expensive ink and try and stay away from aftermarket ink.
5,Cannon brand is not the cheapest ink you can buy but they work great every time. I have used repackaged cartridges in the past -- the sometimes leaked and made a mess in my printer.
4,Product works great in my Canon printer. My print copies pare for home use not commercial.  I will be ordering more ink in the future.
5,This is exactly what it says. I only wish it would come with an extra small black. Though that's my fault for not ordering that one instead.
3,I would like it more if the package included both 225 Black and 226 Black.
5,Perfect package for what I needed and arrived quickly. My printer does have black 226 but I don't go through it as quick as these other 4. Was able to get my school papers printed on time.
4,Ink results in very good printing. The only problem is I wish there were more ink in the cartridge.
3,Behold the most expensive liquid in the world but now you can print your photos at home.
5,works as stated
4,Pro: It works in my MX882 printerCons: Over priced ink. I have read that some of the latest off-brand inks work well.
5,Canon ink cartridges are consistently good.
4,I have to buy these for my printer and the price is better than Walmart and other stores that sell printer ink
5,I love these sets.  The ones with the black are a waste.  I like having the ink delivered to my home.  Good value.
4,Works great but too pricey. The copiers themselves use ink at a very fast rate something I am sure most manufacturers design into the copier.
4,they work fine
3,Generally prices keep going up. I don't understand why gray is not included.  All in one devices will not function if one tank is out.
5,I have tried refilling tanks and buying already refilled ones.  This is a little more money but worth it knowing it won't leak all over be dried up or not last very long.
5,order came in on time and being as I have ordered these before there has been no problems.
4,It's just what I thought it would be. Works in my printer and haven't had any issues so far.
5,I've purchased all my Canon printer ink from Amazon though it seems that they run out too quickly.  Never dries up during porlonged periods of no use like my old Epson printer and Ink did.
5,Good price.  I order this ink pack all the time.  Completely satisfied with the quality.  Only wish they would include the Black 226 in the package as I must order that cartridge separately.
4,Ink shows low on all cartridges even tho they are brand new. Also I wonder how the color cartridges can go low when I printed only in black.
5,Great ink for the price. My wife loves printing out pics and then replacing older frames with different pics. Luckily these bad boys lasted through the abuse she put on them. Great Ink for a great price.
5,good value and shipped on time
5,We all need ink! I have a Canon printer so I buy their ink. Since it's a photo printer their five cartridge printer puts out beautiful photos. Just be careful what ink you buy!
4,I .wish they would pack it with the smaller black.  I now have three of the 225 and my printer doesn't seem to use that one.
5,I have ordered many of these and have had no problems. If your using a cannon printer then you know you need a good cheap place to buy these cartridges. Amazon is the cheapest I have found.
5,Like the most - all in oneLeast - price
5,Ink inks.
5,Very pleased with my canon printer and only use brand name inkjet refills as I killed another printer by using generic ones.  These cartridges seem to last a long time too.
3,I needed the small black cartridge alsoprice was a little high for the four pack.the cartridges were loose in the box and not in any type of packagebut there was the bubble padding to hold them from moving around.the product its self was what I wanted
5,Expensive  but all ink jet cartridges are.  Cheaper here than the office stores.  They work great with my Canon printer and took only a couple of days for delivery.
5,Delivery was prompt and product as advertised.  No complaints.
5,Great product but way too expense.  It's crazy the prices that you need to pay for ink.  I tried non Canon ink and it damaged my printer.  Had to buy a new printer
5,There has been times in the past where I have purchased ink and the ink would seem old and not work to well.  This works great and shipping was ahead of schedule.
5,I am using these for three years now. Don't even think going with no-brand ones should you value your printer.I own a cannon MX882 and it prints beautiful photo
5,They were described accurately.
5,I keep reordering for my MX882 Printer quality is great and price is right. I have purchased fake ink  before only to be disappointed this is genuine and comes in the box
5,Happy with the Ink purchase and price.  Our only regret is we wish amazon had this in stock so it would get to us faster since we have access to Amazon Prime.
2,I ordered these for my printer but found out that this contains 4 cartridges not 5 as I require. I was able to find a replacement for the #226 cartridge that is also listed on Amazon. I would advise to do more checking and find a replacement that is equally as good as the original. Replacements are listed on Amazon and I would mention the name of the supplier but Amazon would not let me post that review. I hope this helps you in your decision making.
1,My printer is a Pixma MG5320. I ordered a group of printer cartridges incl. cli225 bk. I thought the cli 225 bk was the same as mine being the cli226 bk. This was a mistake on my part so I have tried to order a new cli226 bk that will fit my printer. You would think that it would be a simple procedure of ordering the right part and sending the required credit card. I have tried numerous times and your requests go roundand round for Passwords etc. This is really sad as I have to drive through the mountains for 2 1/2 hrs. to buy my ink from a Staples store. Your ordering procedure is pathetic.
4,I need it I have to use it so I buy it.  Never thought about liking it or loving it.
4,The inks are fine but I just wish they would last a little longer.
5,I learned the hard way.  I bought generic ink cartridges for my first Canon printer.  It ruined the printer beyond repair.  I now use only the product specifically made for the machine.
5,What else can you say - have tried alternate inks more reasonably priced but always come back to the Canon for best quality. Yes it is pricey but no compatibility or quality issues.
2,It was ok But I had to order another one diffrent black one for my printer from another company cause it wasnt included in the package and the small black ink was the reason I ordered ink in the first place so it should had five for this printer and  not 4
5,sell the printer cheap price the ink out of the range...all these mfg need to get more reasonable in this area...and quitchanging out the ink...make ink compatible on all printers for same mfg!!!
4,Good . Will if they add on 226 blackis will better
4,Ink lasts a decent amount of time. About the same as most printers I have had. Easy to install. No complaints. Prints good quality photos.
4,Great ink but spendy. Nothing bad to say here and nothing really to say at all. This stuff works obviously and Canon make a bundle off of it.
4,I really appreciate being able to get the necessary ink for my printer for a great price.  Order arrived in great shape and on time.
4,These work fine and I am please with the deliver time. I just wish they weren't so expensive. It only takes a couple refills to pay for a new printer.
2,It's not good when replacement parts for something cost more that the something and they need to be replaced so often. Check out one of the videos on YouTube regarding this...hopefully BEFORE you buy an Inkjet printer.
5,No substite for the real thing. The fake ones will get ink all over your hands and will make your printer give you an error message.
5,If you was the best in color fidelity for your priceless photos get genuine Canon ink cartridges.The simply work - all the time.They are expensive but are worth the price!
3,I bought this package for my Canon Pixma MX-882 printer believing I could replenish all the cartridges on my printer. However this package is missing the CLI-226 printer black cartridge. Would have been beneficial if all necessary cartridges were included in one package. 5 stars otherwise.
5,everything was good it just came a day late the box it came in was in perfect condition  what else do i have to say well worth it becuase its alot cheaper than the stores for this bundle pack.
5,These inks are expensive but colors are vibrant clean and work flawlessly with the printer. It's a good investment if you are printing graphics that need to look perfect.
4,I got pretty much what I expected. There was nothing particularly good or bad about it. It was just fine.
5,Great
5,Yes the real product not some off-brand. Great price for this product compared to Staples
4,I would like this set a lot better if the gray and other black cartridge were included.  Otherwise it is a pretty good value.
4,Haven't printed photos yet but the black and white and color letter with graphics did well.  Canon ink is safest for photos.
4,Only brand I use.
4,just what I was looking for good product and description... better than walk in office supply store prices. will definitely continue to order as needed.
3,I was thrown off by your ad when I selected the printer it said people who buy the printer also buy the ink which made me think I had to buy this product.  Come to fnd out there was ink with the printer and I could have saved $50.
4,Consistently good reliable product.  Like to use Canon products on Canon equipment.  Ink is bright and lasts as well as can be expected.
4,its what is required and dose a good job for all my printing needs depending on paper used. no mess.
4,It is name brand ink which is all I buy though I hate the price.
4,This was something I can't buy locally and this price was lower that I can purchase it for at a big box store 80 miles away!
4,Just as expected.
4,What more can I say...these fit my printer cost a lot and I am happy I can buy them. Thank you for having them.
5,Great Ink at a decent price.Always buy genuine ink. Every time I bought generic ink it was too run down or something and the colors were never as vivid and saturated as they should have been.
5,its ink....not much to say about it lol it works well for my printer and it was not a bad price
5,Fast ship and ink cartridge as described.
4,good product at a good price
4,Excellent product and very easy to install. However I wish it had CLI-226 4550B001 and CLI-226 4546B001. I would still recommend this product to my friends.
5,Product arrived ahead of schedule cost was reasonable and functioned exactly as expected. Amazing!!!
4,Thought it was a good buy and I would recommend it to anyone who has this Canon printer scanner and Fax machine.
5,Canon Ink is Canon Ink like I said before. Only problem is why can't you put the 226 BLACK in this box? It runs out too.
5,The inks produce photos and graphics that are true to life. The photos I print are very professional looking. I also don't seem to run out of ink as quickly asI have with other brands.
3,My new CANON printer has 5 (count 'em folks) 5 ink tanks.  I can't find a single CANON ink pack which gives me ALL the tanks - so I bought this plus the 226 BLK separately.  I'm not happy with CANON but the AMAZON experience was fine.
5,So far very pleased but will be anxious to see how fast I consume the cartridges.  So as of this writing I have no reason to give it anything other than the high rating.
5,These are genuine and my printer likes them.
5,Have made this and other Canon Ink purchases as needed many times .  Always well packaged on time never a problem. Always first quality Canon ink.
4,Good quality.works good but I will look for a better price in the future. Can't think of anything else to say.
4,The product is great and so is my Canon Copier/Scanner. I would have given the product one additional star if the price were more reasonable.
5,I always buy the canon brand from my canon printer.  The knock-off ones are cheap and don't last very long.
5,They worked as advertised we've had no problems with them
4,I found it fast in stock at a good price. The ink arrived sooner than I expected it to. I will shop here again.
5,good value  Wish you sold the 225Black separately too
4,No problems with it It's ink! Easy to use. There is still ink available in the cartridge even when the computer says It's low
5,I've been using this same printer ink for a long time and the reason I keep buying it is because it works great and it's original from Canon the printer manufacturer.
5,Works great
5,Two of  the cartridges have already been installed and are working perfectly.
5,works great
3,Color excellent pricey.
4,It's the name brand so it works.  Less expensive here than in a retail store.
5,I have always been a fan of canon printers. Cheaper ink than HP. I have used some cheap ink before and always have one or two that do not work. Not with the canon ones. They always work.
4,I bought a set of after market cartridges that did not work at all.  These cost more than I'd like but they work.
5,Canon printing ink products don't need recommendationsthe brand speaks for itself. What was deferent here was thegreat saving I've got in this package you can not beat it.
5,No comment to this rather dumb question.
5,I tried the highly recommend off-brand but not again. Colors were not as vivid and true. Canon knows how to make this toner! Too bad it is so astronomically expensive!!
5,Canon ink for a canon printer...is the only way. Substitute other inks and be forewarned...they'll clog or mess up ur printer. Maybe not at first but they will.
4,work wells oem brand bundled prices much more cost effective.
4,Canon quality Canon performance. I've not been disappointed yet by their ink cartidges although (like all ink cartridges) the price is high.
5,I will always buy the name brand when it come to replacement ink.  I bought generic one time and my copier has not worked since.
4,Cannon inks tend to be expensive. This was reasonably priced here and it had all the cartridges that I need in one package.
1,I bought this set March 6 2013 and did not install them until April 28 2013.  The magenta was a leaker in the package.  It poured all over my hands and took a mad scramble to keep  the ink from damaging surroundings.  Luckily there was no damage to the printer as it didn't make it that far. There is no contact information or guarantee on the outer box/container. The other colors were okay.  Apparently there is no means to report a defective cartridge.  Because I did not install them within 30 days Amazon says no partial refund is required. FYI: You may want to install these immediately or you may not be able to report defective product.
5,I rated this 5 stars because there was nothing bad or wrong with the product or the folks who sold it to me. Received it on time and it worked as one would expect.
4,This was my first ink purchase for my new printer and it worked and I saved some money.  All is good
4,love when you get all the ink you need
3,Would be 5 stars if they weren't ridiculously expensive.
4,I had no problems with this product.  It is what I expected at a good price.  I would buy it.
4,Item as described. Works great in my printer and was reasonably priced.
5,The price is better than I can find in my local stores and the pack contains all the ink I need for my printer. Good quality product.
5,This includes all cartridges except for the photo black that my Canon MG-5220 uses.  The print quality is exceptional especially on photos & it sips ink compared to my old HP unit.
5,Great value!
5,The cartridges work just fine color as expected.  My only complaint is that the color cartridges run out quickly but this is true with all cartridges and all printers.
4,This box contains the most-often used combination of ink so I order it the most.  The small black runs out much slower.
4,Great item! Just like the picture and matches the description fine. It was of good quality. I would buy one again.
5,When it comes to ink you get what you pay for. I once bought a "compatible" ink no more!
5,Brand new factory brand. No defects.
4,Good ink no problems
4,Great ink for a good price.
5,Arrived as expected
4,Good price and excellent fulfillment.
4,Really love it great product amazing both the price can be better and the quality is great awesome A A AAAAA AAAAAAAA Sees AAAAA
4,Does what it is designed for. Drawback is relatively high price for these printer inks. Should hve larger discount for buying this package
5,No comment to this rather dumb question.
5,One last quite a while in our household and for that quite affordable
5,Great buy. Seems I use a lot of ink.
5,It's ink!  It's by Canon.  It works!  Output is nice but it is a bit on the pricey side...  I am going to try some generic ink to compare.
5,this ink can be purchased elsewhere but Amazon always has the best pricing overall.  the ink is ink it works like it's supposed to not much to review about it.
4,BELIEVE IN BUYING THE ORIGINAL IMITATIONS JUST DO NOT CUT IT.  IT IS OVER PRICED BUT THAT IS THE NATURE OF INK
5,quick shipment . Great product. Thank you
5,They are packaged exceptionally well and easy to install.If you have a Canon MG8220 these last quite awhile and are way better than a generic brand that dries up within days.
5,I buy this ink from Amazon and it works for my printer.  No problems with it.
4,The Canon ink is very reliable - but it is used up by my Canon MG8120 printer entirely too quickly.
5,Better than getting the cheaper stuff. I always know to expect a much better print of photos. Wish all 6 tanks would come in one set. Canon MG6220 printer.
4,I like it  just fine but it would be better if all were included. 4 pack but the MX882 takes 5 pack ok
1,It's a total lie that this ink works for a Canon MG6620 even though the little ink finder said "Yes." I opened my printer today to change the ink for the first time and it has 250 and 251 which are a TOTALLY different size! The box itself does not even list my printer. :| Furthermore if you look up 250/251 the little finder box say "NO" it will not work with your printer even though it's listed in all the printer numbers on top AND IT'S WHAT'S IN MY PRINTER NOW! I am now stuck with an open box and a bitter heart. Amazon you've failed me.
5,I only use Canon ink and am very happy with it. I've talked with friends that use refills from various places and listen to their dissatisfaction and won't go there.
5,They are canon replacements not knock offs.
5,What more can I say about printer refills. If I didn't love canon printers I wouldn't be using the refills but I am happy with all aspects of this name brand.
5,This product was new in the box for less then what I could have gone out and bought it for any where in town. Nothing fancy about it. It's just something that works.
5,This is your standard ink cartridge replacement.  They work with no issues.  Ink is way overpriced but this seems to be the best deal I have found for cannon brand ink.
5,No issues; works well. The ink was fresh and my printer can now print.  Not much else to say :)
4,Not much to say on replacement parts except OEM are preferred over discount ink.  Shipment arrived on time and was as advertised
4,Good colors but not enough ink in these cartridges for my needs
5,You can't go wrong with this ink.  The colors are bright and beautiful.  However because of the price I would not recommend it for everyday printing only special art.
5,I've never purchased any other brand so I have nothing to compare it with. But I'll continue to purchase this particular brand because I have no complaints.
5,This is actually a good price for ink where I live. I will buy this ink again on here when I need to. Shipping was quick too which is always nice!
5,Perfect combination for my Canon MG 6220 printer.
4,Well pleased with Canon ink. Wish it was a little cheaper.
4,This ink works very well - no smearing or running.  I would recommend it to anyone what owns a Canon printer.
5,a great value and works well. This is not first time I've ordered. I've never been disappointed. I would recommend this product to anyone that has a canon printer and Amazon to provide it!
5,Perfect for the MX922 and never any problems.  Some feel it is pricey but the reliability is worth it.
3,Expensive and seems to run out too fast (even when we haven't printed that many pages!)
5,Uhm I don't know what else this review is supposed to say.  My printer prints again-the ink came neatly packaged.  What else is there to say?
5,Fast shipping just as described!
5,Works as expected would buy again!
1,I installed this ink in my compatible Canon printer and after printing less than 5 pages I began receiving print head error messages.  I pulled the print head out of the printer and it appeared that the print head was oozing ink as if the cartridges malfunctioned and were leaking.  Troubleshooting determined the error is a fatal error requiring replacement of the print head.  The replacement print head costs more than the printer when I purchased it new.  I don't know if this is counterfeit or defective ink but you may wind up purchasing a new printer if you use it.  Beware.
5,I've been using Canon printers for years and this specific ink for years. Never had a problem.
3,All Canon products are over priced and their ink cartridges are no exception.  They work well but I have to order new ones too quickly.
5,Genuine Canon is the only thing I will by. You can depend on Canon for best results.
5,What can you say about a product that is made for your printer. Works great great reproduction. And yes I highly recommend Canon printers.
4,Nice but rather expensive
5,Exact OEM cartridges. Great product.
3,These ink cartridges are somewhat expensive and it does not include the CLI-226 BK cartridge.  You must buy that one separately. I don't have specifics but I will say that the ink doesn't seem to last as long either.
4,Normal stuff it you hate to shop in a store like I do.
4,It is resonably priced ink that arrived quickly.  aaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaa
5,Good price for the ink I needed.
5,Canon product for a Canon printer.  Should work fine and it does.I love my Canon printer and would recommend this replacement ink tank to everyone owning one too.
5,Ink is ink price is good
4,My home office printer uses these and I have found that it is easier to order the multipack than individual box.
3,These inks work well.  Just too bad that they only come prepackaged in such a way that I tend to have too much of some ink and too little of another.
4,Great  only wish it came with gray color.
5,Never had a problem with legitimate Canon inks.
5,No complaints at all thanks
5,This product is great.
5,After trying an off brand ink and clogging up my printer;  will purchase Canon ink from now on -just wish it wasn't so expensive
5,Cartridge easy to install. Clear indication when ink supply running low. Ink seems to last a reasonable time.  Clear print out.  Very happy with printer by the way which was a recent purchase from Amazon.
5,Have used it one time already and it work just great.
5,I order these ink cartridges all of the time.  They are excellent and last fairly long depending on how much you use your color printer.
5,Works like it is supposed to. Great ink made for my machine. I love Canon products because the company is so reliable and a please to do business with.
5,Never too expensive
5,I have purchased this item more than once for my canon printer and it works perfect also delivery was in good time.I purchased this item at amazon.com and recomend a buy.Jerry R.
4,I would like to see all 5 of the ink tanks in a single package instead of having to order twice.
5,Who can argue about the quality of Canon inks.This purchase was truly a good buy and shipment to the mailbox is always considered a plus.Good value.
4,Good product.
5,They were excellant condition. Worked well in are copier which we usefor photography development pictures..We use a canon mx882 copier.It puts out quality pictures very vivid colars.
5,Good price.
5,Good
5,Shipped and packaged well.  Needed ink for my printer...ordered it here and they sent it to me.  I loaded it and it works just fine.  No issues.
4,While I wish Canon offered high capacity version of the ink at least they offer a multipack with a better price.
4,Good product!This ink works great all the time.
5,It was the correct ink
4,I'd love it if it wasn't so expensive.
5,great product and it arrived on time.
5,Was having a hard time finding all of the cartridges in the store.  This is the most economical way to buy these cartridges as a pack.  You will eventually use all of the colors.
5,easy to load in my computer and fit perfect
4,it fits my printer its each color so when one runs out i only have to change that color the pictures and documents colors are good
3,Be careful some Canon printers require one more ink which is not included with this set.
5,I hate buying ink. I have to though. My printer is happy.
5,only buy canon official ink  all others cause bleeding issuesand paper to stick  and print head clogging issues dont waste your time with anything else
5,Delivered as promised.  Good price.
4,come on time and no issue with the deliver and no issue on unpacking and easy to install for me
3,I was originally attached to only getting Canon cartridges for Canon printers but now I vote for getting the alternative brand's Canon-compatible ink cartridges. You may save some cash with this value pack but it's not more than you save by going with another brand!
5,It's an OEM.  What is there to say.  A little pricey though.  I try and print in B & W to save the colored ones.
2,2 stars because the red acted like it was empty as far as my printer was concerned we pay a large  price for 4 inks and only 3 work. Had not the time nor wanted to extra expense to return and wait again. Bought new inks since and no printer issue so assume it was this one package it is the brand name ???????
3,I need the ink for my printer but I hate paying so much. My printer takes the 225 and 226 blank ink but this does not have the 226. I'm not sure what the difference is between the two black inks but since they are already selling this large combo why not include it?
3,Canon ink works very well in Canon printers but so do a lot of other no-name inks.  I hate to pay almost twice as much just for the name Canon on the label so I have quit buying Canon named inks.
5,Good but expensive and seem to run out faster than before.
5,Good Canon Ink
5,I always use it for my printer MG5320 no need gambling with 3rd party product. This is all what we can rely on.
5,These work just as stated and are designed for the printer. I like the price and the colors are great. I can recommend them to everyone.
5,Real Canon Cartridges  - an excellent buy and excellent service.
4,Work well I just wish they weren't so expensive.
5,a staple in our house.
5,Good factory ink.  Prints as expected.  Doesn't void warranty with use.  Packaging was great.  Would recommend to all how have compatible printers.
5,For all of the work that I do and printing good ink is important and that's to Amazon I can get it affordable thru you.
5,What can you say it works well and is easy to install.  I do wish ink prices were cheaper considering it must cost so little to make.
3,Arrived on time and in good condition. The product (along with the printer) works extremely well but the tank size is so small that it doesn't last very long at all. If we printed more often I would get a different printer.
5,Our Canon printer needed more ink and these were a great price.  They have done the trick.  I will be adding to my shopping list and reordering!
3,Im sure the ink is great. I bought this ink as a backup for my printer because I use a lot but I am disappointed that it doesnt include the gray and the extra black to fill all the spaces in my printer.
4,Good ink  for a good printer
5,off brand ink cartridges did not seem to work quite as well as the canon.  these were priced competitively even including the cost of shipping.
5,Worked well
5,quality ink - best price from Amazon.the only complain is that Canon uses the razor marketing strategy - they sell you inexpensive printer then you have to buy expensive ink from them.  Yikes!!
5,I've never had a bad cartridge in a genuine Canon cartridge pack and colors are always excellent.
5,none
5,As described.
4,It didn't have one of the cartridges I needed.
5,nice transaction. just what you would buy in the store.
5,saved a lot of money compared to buying at staples about half the price.  When on a budget is really helps and they worked great
3,Although I like the color quality of the printing I find the cartridges do not last very long. These new printers suck up so much ink it isquite an expense. A least you can get them cheaper from Amazon.
5,This is a handy way to get OEM inks for your Canon ink jet printer.  The price is better than Costco's (or was when I purchased them).
5,The ink cartrage is Canon brand so it was the recommended replacement  Canon 4479A003 BCI-3eBK Black Ink Cartridge        ¬†item and the item was shipped on time and arrived when scheduled
5,It is ink. It is for my printer. It works! I use a lot of ink for a lot of printing so this product does the job.
5,just what I wanted
5,I remember having to buy ink cartridges separately. What a pain. Now I can get these 4 cartridges in one package. And the price is right! Woo-Hoo!
5,Great deal
4,Handles my printing needs........
5,This came promptly and well packaged. The price as right and I was able to bundle. Will order again when I need the other colors.
5,Good purchase
5,Same ink they sell in Staples.  I could not find the other black cartridge I needed but these are very good.
1,Removed my old empty cartridges and disposed of first. Opened the package to install as I have done numerous times before. Removed the plastic wrap from the black cartridge 225 exposing the twist-off orange cap. Rotated the arm on the orange capo to loosen and remove from cartridge and several drops of black ink came out and fell onto my carpet creating a stain as I pulled the cap away. Never had this happen before so I think it's the exception not the rule but needless to say I am not very happy with the stains in my carpet from the ink!!
4,These are as expected and they arrived in good shape and in a timely manner.
1,to put the price in perspective US's minimum wage in 2013 is $9 an hour. In order to buy a whole set (including the black ink that is missing from this combo pack). One must work around 7 hours in order to afford this ink. The ink level is ridiculously low to begin with and when the printer starts I believe it goes through the cleaning cycle which wastes a lot more ink. If you buy the whole set brand new then go through the cleaning process about 7 times you will completely run out of ink. I rarely use my printer and it's already running empty.
5,THE PRICE IS GREAT COMPAIRED TO RETAIL STORE.
5,Thank you for the great pricing of these.  I have searched round about for a decent price and thank goodness you had it.
3,I know it says what it is on the box but when the only one you are missing is the 226 black and you think you have it you will get upset.
5,This is a great price on this ink although these Canon printers do tend to chew through some ink cartridges.  This value pack is a good deal.
3,This ink works just fine for my Canon printer.  Very clear and colors are pretty good.  Much better than other generic ones.  I hope there are more ink in these and they would last longer
5,Colors are clear sharp and long lasting.  Use this ink for photos third party inks have faded under similar conditions.
3,The ink is operationally decent. It's just wack how expensive it is.
4,noticed a little ink leaking from cyan package  but overall works well . Will continue to buy on line .
5,Not exactly like pictured but acceptable
5,Very good for the Canon printer.  I wished they would last longer.
5,I got super quality printing with these cartriges always used a Canon brand so you run trouble free.Hightly recommend this product and vendor
5,It's ink - what can you say ??
5,Just like I would buy in the store but a lot cheaper.  I just buy these right before I run out so I will have them on hand.
5,I don't use this for photos but for documents it is great.  The cartridges last a long time and the price is right!
4,Excellent but too expensive.
5,Ink last a long time. I print a lot and has great photo quality. Pictures look awesome. Lets you know when it is running low.
5,You can't go wrong with Canon ink for a Canon printer. The ink lasts for a good amount of time and makes nice color prints.
5,Great product. Timely shipping. Saved some money. So far so good. Would recommend this product to anyone with comparable printer products. Just wish the cartridges were bigger.
5,Ordered this ink a couple of times now and I've never had an issue with it.  Always works as it should.
5,Great Ink but too expensive!!!
5,Great product I haven't had any issues with the ink.
5,Great product at a super price.  Amazon has a good selection of products.  Have purchased several items and been happy with all of them.
5,This is such a great value and works perfectly with my printer. Glad to have discovered I can order on-line and save a bundle. Fast shipping.
5,This ink worked perfectly and was just as good as the original ink that came with my printer. The price was competitive and delivery was very fast! I will definitely order this product again.
4,too expensive need to cut back the prices
5,Great.
5,These are the easiest tanks to use.  I have never had a problem with them. I follow the directions and get results.
5,none
5,Perfect for my printer
5,using the manufacturer's own ink with your Canon printer can't be beaten.  The only down side is it doesn't last long and is expensive.
5,Product as advertised prompt shipping..
5,Great inks for my great Canon printer. The inks last a long time and Amazon's price is good.
5,Great unit that works well with my canon printer.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has a Canon Pixma printer.
4,it's was good buy
5,I love that I can buy this and use it to make Giclees printed on cotton paper. I can't find another ink that works as well..
5,I wanted to have a good resevoir of ink as it seems to run out soo fast however this is a good amount of ink at a reasonable price.
5,The value pack is just that; it is a great value! The cartridges work wonderfully with the printer and provide high quality printed pages.
4,Canon's Product over priced
4,Should include narrow black cartridge!
5,good
5,I have had bad luck with aftermarket cartridges. I now only use OEM. These were a good price
5,Ordered these many times never a problem
5,I love this ink....easy to use and delivers beautiful photos.  I switched from Epson to Canon.....no regrets at all.  I think Canon is more user friendly.
3,Great price but the yellow cartidge leaked. Will see how long the cartridge lasts and if it dries up. If it lasts will buy more when needed. Will edit review in a few months
4,Satisfied. Will order again.
5,Same quality as purchasing your ink from your local store same packaging. I would purchase again. Value pack better deal in the long run.
5,It's good but expensive. But in my case since I don't use that much it is ok.
4,TOO EXPENSIVE
5,Satisfactory. Very quick delivery. Expensive ink but I am afraid to try off-brand. Have had problems in the past with ink other than Canon.
5,First time purchase with my new printer and have not used just yet; this is my second owned cannon printer. Cannon has good products and printers.thank you
5,This ink provides excellent color which creates vivid pictures.
5,Sometimes it is just easier to use Amazon to stock up on items instead of making a special trip out to get them
5,Great price and I would tell others to get them... Arrived fast in the mail and I don't have to go around trying to find them ...
4,Good Buy!
4,Exactly what I wanted!
5,It is Ink - it works.  I don't really know what else to say other than we installed it and our Canon printer prints beautifully.
5,I love using these cartridges for my printer. Good quality ink and easy to load in the printers. I have not had any problems with them.
5,I love not having to have someone take me to the store to purchase my inc so this is a great way for me to keep stock.
5,The best ink
5,What a GREAT deal on these!!!!!!!!!!!!  Love having all the different colors and the price was the BEST!!!!  They worked Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Always a great product
5,I'm glad I purchased this item.  It had a great price.  I recommend this item highly to anyone who appreciates a great deal.
5,Always a good product.
5,Same brand you can purchase at the office supply stores...
5,Great price for the cartridges and they always arrive so quickly.  It's nice to be able to save a little bit of money on this product.
5,All fine and works as you would expect from an original packed package of printer cartridges.Would recommend this for everybody who is looking into buying excellent quality.
5,I don't have this printer anymore.  But the ink was awesome when I did.  Printed fantastic photos.
5,Product was as described.  The cartridges were the correct ones and new unwrapped.  The cartridges were shipped on time and came quickly.  Would buy again.
5,on time  as presented  second order  perfecto
5,Really like our current Canon Printer and these print cartridge bundles are a convenient way to replenish individual cartridges.
5,It's ink. I hate this new format where you have to use 15 words to rate a product that is obviously easy enough to figure out!
5,It's printer ink. Not a whole lot more you can say.  It does last for a while gives terrific smooth printouts.
4,Just what I needed for my printer....
5,This ink is sharp clear and lasts a long time. Refilled ink cartridges don't last as long. These tanks are of excellent quality.
5,good buy and excellent service
5,Great product at a fair price.
5,Nice price
5,Delivered timely and worked as exactly as expected. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for quality and good price.
5,Anything ok

5,everything as promised
4,Perfect
4,Great quality but very expensive!
4,Excellent
4,Works well.  Cost is ok
5,Our printer won't accept the off brand only these.
5,Exact Canon Replacement. The black and multiple color pack saves a little over having to buy each color on it's own.
5,Good price. Quick delivery.
5,Ink works great with my Canon printer especially when I print on good paper. Prints turn out like professional printer. Will continue to purchase this item as needed. Thanks!
5,They installed easily never done it before. The packaging was a little beat up because it was pushed into another box but all in all great...
5,Hard to believe but the deal was better than Costco; especially when you figure in time and taxes. They worked perfectly.
5,It's ink.  It came it fit in my printer it worked.  what more can a guy want.
5,It is a good product and very easy to install into my printer. I would recommend it to any of my friends
5,This ink set is a great value at this price.

5,Works great ships quickly.
5,Just what I needed.
4,pricey but good quality

5,I like the Canon quality. Been using Canon ink and photo paper for 8 years. I'm definitely a repeat buyer and satisfied.
5,Thi sis a great product and i loved the price. now i can afford to print as many pictures as i want and quality is great!
5,The way I go through paper and ink this purchase  choice is a definite money saver for me yes? Si? Oui?.
5,JUST AMAZING PRODUCT BRAND NEW PACKAGE WITH INFINITE AMOUNT OF INK THAT SEEMS LIKE IT NEVER GOES AWAY YOU WONT REGRET BUYING THIS PRODUCT
5,I keep a backup of this ink so I don't have to dash off to the store when I run out.  Good price.
5,This is the ink my printer requires. I like being able to order it and not having to run all over town looking for the product.
5,we make a lot of copies at home so go through a lot of ink. This is a good pack for our printer
5,Just what I order they work  great and price was right too. Will be back to buy in future too.  Thanks Amazon
5,Received product on schedule. No problems loading ink cartridges. Works just as expected. There are no concerns. Would do this again but ink cartridge prices remain too high.
5,Great value and seem to run out at the same time I empty a package of ink  Works Great. PB
5,It was what I wanted
5,Brand name ink is the best to use
5,I have been purchasing my Canon supplies via Amazon for several years - best price for Canon ink.
5,I'm so glad I found this good deal for my printer ink.  Great product for a good price. I liked it.
4,thanks
5,Just the ink I need for my printer.  I do wish the ink cartridges were larger but that's the way it is.
5,I've had a Canon 5200 color printer for years and always used Canon cartridges.  I've never had any problems with them.
5,Perfect quality ink for my Canon Photo Printer. Gives me beautiful saturated colors. I like printing out landscape wildlife macro and sports photos.
5,I wouldn't think of  inserting "copies" which might destroy this perfect printer.  As far as I am concerned there is no better printer!
5,This four pack "value" of ink truly is a deal.  Ink can be so expensive.  It is nice to find deals when you can.
5,Arrived in 2 days.  The ink cartridges last fairly well and are easy to load.  I have never had a problem with canon inks.
3,Ink is crisp and clear. The cartidges are small and all are used even when you only want to print in black. As a result the ink doesn't last very long.
5,Have used these for several years. They work well never had any problems no leaks no problems. Only drawback is $
5,Always a reliable product.
5,As advertised.  No complaints and cheaper than the big box store.
5,These cartridges are as specified for my Canon printer.  Your prices are nice too!Joan
4,It was good no problem
5,Can't beat 2 day shipping and a decent product price.  Other than that they were as described and exactly what I expected.  Hard to gush over ink cartridges.
5,The ink lasts a long time and it always comes out clear and doesn't run.  You definitely get your money's worth with this product.
5,This is a Cannon product and works great have had no problems with it. It was delivered in 3 days. Would recommend to others and would again.
5,Canon quality. Exact replacement. Same as you buy from Canon. Shopped very fast. I would only use Canon replacements in my printer.
5,Again always needed for my printer.
5,What can I say?  It's ink and I need to print stuff.
5,these materials are always a bit pricey but they are great quality and make the print look extra good on quality paper
5,It's pretty simple . Easy to replace. Product shipped quickly.
5,These ink cartridges are reliable and install easily; wouldn't trust anything else in my Canon printer.
5,These work great and is one heck of a bargain compared to store prices. We print often and are getting ready to order again.
4,Quality as expected
4,ink
5,Great price
5,original package at a good price.
5,I'm happy with this purchase in all ways. Free shipping adds to the value. They go with a Canon PIXMA printer I also bought at Amazon.
5,This is original ink no refills great stuff at a great price.  Priced around and this is a good deal.
4,Thank you
5,Works great and very easy to use.  Plan to order more as the need arises.  I would recommend this to anyone.
5,I'm an OEM ink guy so this is a great deal on Canon ink packages. A no brainer versus the big box office store markup.
5,I believe some people who buy bargan ink believe it's the way to go. Howeverat this point I prefer to use the Canon ink.
5,IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET CANON ORIGINAL.  MANY PLACES LIKE EBAY ARE SELLING INK FROM CHINA. I WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL.
5,Excellent
5,This kit is expensive but you get what you pay for.  Don't even think of trying off-brand inks in your Canon printer.
5,I check different websites every time I need to replace cartridges whether single packs or combo packs and Amazon usually has the best deal.
5,The only brand I buy. I think Cannon is the best.
5,It met my expectations. Came in good shape and works just fine for my printer. I bought it through Amazon and received it in good time.
5,Fast shipping! High quality ink!
3,This package for the price should be a complete set for the Canon Printer it should also include the skinny 226 black that is needed for this printer however the colors are great when printing.
5,we have tried compatible types and they do not work as the real thing canon gets from japan.  always use canon inks.
5,I've only used manufacturer inks in my printers.  I've used Canon inks for many years now and never had a problem.
5,ok
5,So far it is working just as expected. This arrived just before the Cyan ran out. Changed the cartridge and kept on printing.
5,I've shopped around and you can't beat these refills they're delivered quickly at a great price.
5,The price was right and the ink came at a good pace. Works fine in printer.Would buy again for sure.
5,Easy to purchase online toner for my printer.  Saves a trip to the local store.  Would purchase again for home delivery.
1,I have been using this printer for over a year and I have not had this problem before but after just ver 30 days the Cyan and Majenta tanks went completly dry. No warning at all and with Canons lovely software it will only allow you to purchase the ink from them or cancel printing. I cannot even print in greyscale from this piece of crap!I'm the only one that uses this printer at my home so I know there wasn't any excess printing done. At $50 per ink it makes me consider not buying another canon printer.
5,Ink was find what a great deal I received. Wish I could get another deal like this again. Recommend Yes
4,ok.
4,All is well.
5,Ink performance has been excellent.  Consistent color and for me has lasted a long time.
5,It is ink cartridges for canon printers.  It works fine in my canon printer.  Who would have thought that! Colors look fine.
5,Excellent product a litlle expensive but worth the extra dollars. the good thing is the individual cartridges that only have to be replaced when each of them or empty
3,My Canon printer takes six cartriges to work .  Thats rediculous!  The Canon cartridiges are three times the price of the competeting after-market.  That also is rediculous!
5,Item came as described.
5,Canon ink is very good and prints great photos. I love my inkjet printer for printing photos quickly and this ink is top notch.
5,They work fine just wish they weren't so expensive.
5,These ink cartridges work very well in my Canon MG3500 series printer and will continue to order them in the future.
5,We've tried the refilled  cartridges. and they don't work well !  It is best to stay with the correct ones!
5,Good value for the price I like it!Easy to use as well and convenient individual plastic wrapping.Good product
5,This ink is fantastic - they only kind I buy so can't compare to others really. We have a Canon printer -
5,Great OEM product for your Canon printer.  Ink does not ever clog and the ink does last.  My printouts always look great.
5,Excellent product  I would buy it again and recommend it to anyone looking for Canon Ink
5,Always a great result from cannon ink cartridges. Arrived promptly and produced great quality prints from the start. Highly recommend.
5,great thx
5,The ink cartridges I purchased from Amazon worked well in my printer.  I recommend purchasing them!  I think its a great deal.
5,good value use only canon ink to prevent trashing your printheads as i have several times
5,This is a handy way to buy toner for the printer.easier and cheaper than buying them one by one.  I'm completely satisfied.
5,Very pleased thank you!
3,The cartridge was delivered on time. We had no problem with the cartridges. We would order the product again.
5,This gives me all the colors I need for my printer and saves me money!! Great way to buy ink.
3,More overpriced ink cartridges that insert a vacuum cleaner into your wallet and suck out the money but they're all like that so what can you do?
5,Great price and great product. I have purchased cheaper generics and none of them have worked. This is a great product
5,Exactly what was needed at the right price. Better than any local store. I just wish the ink would last longer or Canon would make the tanks larger.
5,Good value got here fast. word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word. There's 15 more words.
4,It is what it is  ink at a decent price
5,Factory ink tanks at a marginal savings. Arrived quick!  What more need be said?
5,Very pleased with this purchase.
5,I have ordered this before.  Great bargain.
5,I had my toner cartridges refilled just this year and the ink ran out in six months. Decided to order original cartridges this time.
5,This is exactly what my printer needs.
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,loved this Value pack! I saved a lot of money and they were just what I needed. Will order again.
5,Great value and package is as is in picture.  I've purchased this item many times and always received it quickly.
5,Received as promised and was the product I ordered. Have used the product in the past. Doesn't seem to last too long.
5,I have ordered these Canon refills in the past from Amazon and they are always the highest quality cartridges and I am extremely satisfied.
5,It is a little pricey but it work The other refill or replica wont work well it may cause damage printer
4,Good price.
4,indispensable ink!
4,great
4,Its ink.
3,I am dissatisfied with how long the ink lasts.  It costs too much for how long it lasts.  The quality of the ink is good but the quantity is short.
1,An outright robbery. Canon make their printers addicted to this ink. One runs out and you have to replace it before you can print.If you're printing B&W only (supposedly)  colored inks will still be used by printer and you end buying again this ridiculously priced fxckin ink
5,Canon products rock!! I love the quality of this printer ink. It is just an awesome piece of machinary to have
5,Good price on oem ink.  I have bought these several times and always been pleased.
5,wish it was not as expensive because it is the ink I need to use in my printer and it goes fast
5,Ink does not last as long as I would like but what ink does?  Happy with purchase and recommend. *(:o}
5,Manufacturer made ink cartridges what else can I say! They work like Canon meant them to because Canon made them!!!
5,The ink cartridges worked out great.
5,As advertised.
4,as expected
5,Had to get a new printer so had to get different ink.  Good color!
5,excellent product . fair price.
5,This product was as described.  It came on time and in great packaging.  It was just what my printer needed.
3,so who likes to pay Canon prices? if you don't do a lot of color printing this may be OK esp. if your printer can use the auxiliary large tank black
5,great price just like the ones in the stores around me saved 10 - 15 dollars
5,Perfect. Arrived as stated.
5,It is everything that I expected it to be.
5,Too too expensive!
5,Puts ink on paper the way I like it. Shipped fast. Happy human over here.
5,Always in need of these guys!
5,The Canon ink works beautifully but is a little pricey. Makes clear and vivid documents every time. Will order again!
5,What can you say about ink for your printer - it works great and is not messy and that's what counts
5,the product was good for a decent price compared to stores.  exactly what i ordered
5,As described
5,Good deal for my MG6100
5,Just what I wanted
5,Love this ink.
5,Thank you for making this ink and items I did purchase affordable and useable.
5,I've purchased these Canon inks from Amazon in the past.  They arrive quickly and print fine.
5,The Cannon colors are a way to go for printing pictures and getting a really crisp clear result.I suggest this item
5,Only way to buy your ink provided you plan ahead and order it prior to the point of need. Product ships promptly.
5,It  is all just what I needed and the delivery could not have been better.
3,If you read my earlier reviews you will see that it's just an ink replacement.  Nothing fancy or special about it.
5,Love my Canon printer and would not consider using anything  other than Canon inks.  No muss no fuss - it works like new.
5,Similar groups of Canon inks were more expensive in the local office supply stores.  It works fine in my printer.
5,glad to get what I want on line and at a good price
5,I have a Canon MX892. This is bargain pricing an it works well.
3,Why doesn't the package contain all the tanks needed for the canon printers of th is model.  It doesn't ave gray.  I would pay more for it to be included.
5,Had to have ink cartridges to print from and these were priced well and work perfectly.What else can I say.
5,Original Canon Ink has always worked great for me. This was no exception.
5,I always buy this package from here for my printer. Thank You. Its great
5,Have ordered this four-pack before and will order it again.  I always keep a spare pack on hand as well.
5,Four pack was a great value.  Only wish the print took a larger cartridge so I would not have to replace them so often.
5,Multi-pack product is much cheaper bought through Amazon than anywhere else and arrives quickly.  Both very important considering how fast today's printers go through ink.
5,Worked Great!
5,Identical to what you can buy in the big box stores.  But at a good savings.  Perfect for the job.
3,It's ink. It works. It fits. I kept forgetting to buy it at costco and needed it right away. Amazon delivered. Wish it was cheaper but I don't use my printer much anymore.
5,good price
5,The ink works great! It has beautiful vivid saturated color. And it lasts plenty long enough for my average use.
5,Received shipment ahead of time. Being a genuine canon product it makes it easy to install with no mess and no fuss.
5,nice quality but too small need to be larger because its suppose office works I'm printing every day a lot of pages
5,thanks
5,great value
5,Just as I expected.  On time delivery.  Would make another purchase again.
5,I bought the unit that uses these cheaper and larger ink cartridges compared to most others.  Very good ink quality too.
5,I'm convinced Canon inks are superior to others for my Canon printer. Colors are definitelymuch better with Canon Inks.
5,I reviewed all the possibilites for purchasing this product and Amazon had the best price.  Of course there is no subtitute for the real product!
5,Received ink cartridges very promptly and they work just fine.  The price was reasonable and better than any others I found.  Very pleased overall.
5,No comments
5,No complaints. Arrived on time and works just fine in my printer. I would order these ink cartridges this way again.
5,I already owned the black cartridge so this value pack was perfect.  I have no complaints....it met all my expectations!
3,Like all ink jet ink products they are way over priced... thats how these guys make the big bucks!!!!!  Give the consumer a break and price these products fairly.
5,A convenient package of ink cartridges enabling continuous operation of the printer.  It saves running out for replacement cartridges at the last minute.
5,I have the printer..the ink arrived in one pkg as new and it works. What can you say about printer ink?
5,it was great........ ....... ....... ....... ....... ........ ...... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . . . ..
5,good value
5,Only use original ink tanks no issues with dried up ink clogging ink head.
5,Great product. It is always good to use original ink cartridges with your printer.
5,I like using Cannon color cartridge for my printer they never let me down.
5,Because canon ink tanks  because canon printer.  Thanks  Charlotte
3,I have a Canon MG6220 printer.  It requires a GRAY cartridge as well as the other 4.  had to purchase gray cartridge seperately.
5,I like getting all the ink in one place and its easier and cheaper.I wish it was even cheaper than this
4,Vibrant
5,Good ink but expensive to use.  Never have a problem with leakage.
3,This ink works perfectly well. I just wish that it didn't cost so much to buy replacement ink for a printer that already costs a lot.
5,Standard replacement ink for my printer work well and haven't had any problems with color or blank sheets of paper..
5,Work fine!
5,Pricey but just what I urgently needed for my printer
3,the ink tanks are so expensive that I generally get my photos printed at a local camera store. The cost per print is cheaper.
5,Great ink printer. Works very well. Would recommend this ink for printer for home or home business. Great price and quality
5,After looking around locally and on line this was the best deal I could find and it arrived quicker than expected!
3,Like most modern OEM ink it works in the printer it was designed for but it is very expensive. I think that I will try aftermarket cartridges next time.
5,Every thing was great.
5,as good a price as any.  guaranteed  by amazon return policy.
5,Been using these for a while and they work just fine. A little expensive but they last for a while.
5,good price
5,They work great.
5,CANON INK IS ALL I use in my canon printer
5,Name brand product always works great and package deal is a great value.
5,Works and prints great on my Canon Printer satisfied with purchase.
5,Exact same one at the store but this is much cheaper.Should buy one from this store!I like it
5,great ink for my printer easy to open & fit
5,As you would expect for Canon Ink
3,Excellent ink but the usual Canon rip-off.  One of the inks needed for my printer is not included and has to be bought separately.
5,I am very satisfied with the product and the service.
3,Canon MG6200 series uses these plus CLI-226 Grey and CLI-226  Black (BK).  It's really annoying not to have a factory collection that has all of these products.
3,Cartridges are fine.  Canon printers eat ink
3,I like the ink quality but I would be much happier if printer ink wasn't so over-priced. I sometimes print in grayscale to save money.
5,practical
5,No concerns. Arrived on time and was as represented. Like the different tanks for each color rather than replacing all.
5,Got exactly what was ordered. OEM replacement ink cartridges that work.
5,just what we need to keep my wife's printer running.
5,Exactly like the ones available for purchase in the discount department stores (such as Target Walmart) but for less money!
5,I got no choices to pay that much for the original one.
3,I will probably never buy another Canon copier. The machine itself was relatively inexpensive but it goes through ink like a thirsty dog.The cassettes are easy to install.
2,Wrote the review for the wrong product. Mix up in what was in the package. No 225 cartridge two yellow 226 one cyan 226 cartridge one black 226 cartridge and one magenta 226 cartridge.
5,We all love a good price on our printer ink cartridges.
5,This is great I order an extra one because i print a lot in color and this cartridges it just awesome.
5,Awesome!
5,thanks
5,Original packaging and not damaged what more could you want
5,Canon ink is great for everyday printing even photos!
5,i didn't put them in yet but I know that their good
5,I love being able to get a combo pack on these.
5,It's Canon ink for a Canon printer. Of course it's good.
5,Amazon has great prices for these refills.
5,Original cartage in good shape  Thank you
5,Great product!
3,Ink costs so much darned money it's crazy. While this prints great it's just shame that you need so many cartridges and that they are so expensive.
3,Toner is expensive no matter where you buy it.  It work OK but I can't give high ratings for overpriced products.
4,NEEDED
5,It was cheaper than purchasing these from the bog box stores even with their coupons. The item arrived before the promised time.
5,It is a quality product at a reasonable price.
1,+1 Star  -I got 4 cartridges.-1 Star  -Not in the original packaging so I can't be positive that they are Canon.+1 Star  -I can be positive is that the only time you will see the packaging is on the website.  :-|
5,Never can have enough
1,The picture below shows 5 cartridges but there are indeed just 4 cartridges in this pack. Not worth $60+
5,Have been an HP customer for years and just switched to Canon and feel I got a great value for the money.
5,Product worked fine for my Canon Pixma printer but at a much cheaper price. Highly recommend. Would purchase this again.
5,works great delivered fast - what more do you want?
3,We'll see Thank you!
3,These cartridges never seem to supply the promised number of pages which is frustrating given how insanely expensive they are.
3,The product was exactly what I wanted; but thought it was a complete set for replacement.  I have 5 cartridges and only revived 4 in the package.  Still had to buy an additional black cartridge.
5,Excellent product fast shipping.  Buy without hesitation.
3,It's ink...... What else is there to say....
5,Great ink as always
5,Great cartridges - genuine Canon products.  Immediate delivery
5,received on time
5,Nice pack reasonable price considering cheapest on the market.
1,Combo ink couldn't get the protective wrapper off and when I did  ink was dry.  Have been buying it for years and neverhas happened before.  Quality always has been good.  This group had been stored for a LONG time somewhere.
5,get compatible its cheaper but this one worked well
5,Good product and was less expensive then buying in the store
5,Easy to use shipped quick and easy to install!
5,I use a Canon Printer and Only Canon Ink.
5,So happy that Amazon carries this product! Such a great price much lower than buying in brick and mortar store!
5,Works great
5,OEM cartridges at a fraction of the price of most retailers.
5,Perfect
5,What can you say it is what it is.
5,Great ink!
5,Product as described and prints true colors.
3,It's ink its expensive the printer wastes half of it doing is start-up cycle.
5,Hard to rate ink.  You know.......its INK.
5,always quality products from cannon

5,I always order my ink at Amazon.
5,its wors like its supposed to .
5,Highly recommended. I am very happy with this product.
5,fits fine in printer and works as expected no problems
5,Great quality!
3,I hope the Canon printer does not turn into a HP printer where they make there money from ink not the printers.
5,What I need for my Canon printer.
3,Good quality product that prints well but can be had much cheaper with a different brand. I think I paid for the Canon name...
5,Excellent product
5,came sooner then I expected if. works perfect
3,Does it really have to cost this much for good ink ? I'm tempted to go generic and take my chances.
5,Good product fast service. Canon ink is preferable toreplacement inks in Canon printers. It is brighter andlasts longer.
5,whats to like. they do what there suppose too
5,Shipped on time and worked/fit as described
5,Good ink doesn't clog or smear!
5,Perfect
5,right mix of product - thank you

5,Genuine product and reasonable price. Quick shipping also.
5,Good ink. Just wish It wasn't expensive.
5,Works as one would expect OEM cartridges to.
5,These original ink cartridges are always great.
5,Good ink expensive
5,Hello: Good product & on time delivery.John
5,good value
5,Excellent ink and a very good buy from Amazon.
5,Product arrived exactly as described.
3,I bought a four pack of these ink cartridges and believe me they didn't last long. I think I'm going to stick with HP.
5,Printer ink. That's it.
5,Awesome product at a great price!
5,Great price & quality.
5,Works the way it's supposed to.
3,Product as advertised. needs #226 Black to fill my printers requirements. Had to purchase at local wally world. Hate going to wally world.
5,ok
5,No complaints about the ink only the price.
3,It's ink - nothing outstanding - Works fine - just very expensive.
5,Great product half the cost than other retailers!
5,Does the job.
5,Very easy to install in the printer.
5,Good product.
3,It works.
5,great price and great quality! Would definitely buy again
5,Great and OEM
2,Great ease of use but not enough ink! It's easy to use easy to replace and works fine but for this high price the ink needs to last 3-4 times longer. NOT a good value at all!
5,The package arrived in good condition
3,This is pretty good ink. In a proper printer (not Canon) this ink is actually good. It comes out vivid and clear.
2,It's too damn expensive. A cartridge only lasts a short time. There are 6 in my machine and for home use it's ridiculously high in cost!I like the Canon machine but had I known about the expense of the crtridges I would have gone a different route.
5,Excellent.
5,Yes just as described.
1,The PACKAGING was not as pictured. The inks arrived in a plain white box that did NOT say "Canon"  and I doubt it's actually a Canon product.  Will not buy again.  Couldn't get a refund. Not happy.
5,Same as you buy in store
5,just real from manufacturer quality
5,Received very quickly and work great
5,It's Ink! Met expectations as usual!
5,My printer needs these cartridges often.
5,Product worked exactly as described. Great value!
5,I got it as advertised.
5,Keep my Canon printer humming.
5,Wonderland qualitygreat product
5,Great product for less.
5,Factory original worked great
5,Great Price Fast shipping  As advertised
3,If everyone promised to buy ink they could give the printers away. Reminds me of popcorn in the Theatres. Way overpriced.
5,Needed to replace low ink. Good value.
5,more convenient than going to the office supply
5,Just exactly what I needed
5,Good quality product.  I wish canon would do something about the price on OEM ink I love their printers
5,Arrived fast. Completely satisfied.
5,Received quickly and as described. Thanks!
5,Fast Shipping. Quality product. Thank you so much!
5,Came quickly. Good quality
5,Always thrilled with the price and quality!  Thank you Amazon.
5,Happy Customer!
3,it is fine
5,good for my mx890 canon printer.
2,Received promptly but missing the Cyan cartridge.  Should be four in the box.  Appeared to be a sealed box but started to question once opened as it was stuffed with paper to fill the empty space.  Must have been resealed.
5,They work that is about it.
5,Great
1,The 4-pack arrived with the pictured number of ink cartridges.  However it did not contain the "grey" cartridge used in our recently purchased Canon printer.  We also purchased the printer from Amazon.  Almost immediately the "running low" sign appeared on the cyan and the grey tanks. Why was there no grey cartridges offered nor included with the printer and all the tanks on the printer were "low" (used?) from the very first time the printer was plugged in?  I am not pleased with this purchase.
5,Very good service and good product.
5,Good price and excellent service.
5,I have order these many times....great price.
5,Best price for printer ink!!!!
3,Ok and good value. It's the same product offered by the original Mfgr. but for a little less momey. Thanks
5,GREAT price super vendor.
5,I don't had any problem. very good
5,Good price.  Received quickly.
5,They work! No problems!
3,It works. Costs too much for the amount of ink. Needs the 226 black cartridge included with the color cartridges.
5,Canon Quality all the way.
5,Fast service. Would order again.
5,Exactly what I needed
5,printer works
3,It is a good quality product. But the price is almost same as the retail store. It would be much better if it is cheaper because I print a lot.
5,Good product and even better price.
5,I will get again god merchandise
5,Perfect as always.
5,Super. Great deal.
5,Everything came as pictured
3,I thought I was getting 4 colour changes not one. It comes with 4 different colours it's good for 1 use

5,Great productbut too expensive!
5,Just as expected
5,Works as expected
5,Convenient and reasonably priced
5,Everything is OK
3,Too damned expensive.  Found alternatives.
1,I bought this refill pack for my Canon Pixma MX-882.  I made the stupid assumption that the combo pack would contain all the ink I needed to refill the printer but it only has 4 not 5 of the required cartridges.  This brought me to a standstill when I was trying to print something under deadline.  I had to go out and buy the missing cartridge defeating the entire purpose of planning ahead.  Ridiculous packaging!
2,Be sure you use your ink shortly after installing the cartridges I had them all dry up because I don't use my printer as much as I guess I should. I never had that happen with my old printer or ink and I do the same amount of printing.
5,Worked out perfectly !
1,The ink cartridges were packed in bubble wrap. no original packaging. This is not worth $50.00 Not sure if I should use these and risk messing up my printer. Very disappointing. will not buy again.
5,worked well
5,Great price.
5,Good value for the money.
5,They work great!
5,The price is good
5,As expected
2,I would not recommend the OEM version.  I bought a generic version from a different vendor that works just the same and is so much more cheaper then the OEM.  I got 3 times the amount of ink for still less then what they were charging.
5,Came as advertsed
5,Very pleased.
1,My printer head is rejecting the ink. I had to replace this with another seller
2,All the ink cartridges worked except the black and they pink cartridge. I had to replace the black and the other cartridge to make it work from best buy.
5,just what i wanted
5,It arrived in perfect condition.
5,Item as described.

5,Great price
5,what I expected
5,Good
2,The package came with the ink colors but missing black. I'm very disappointed being that I purchased a package for what I thought was a nice deal....well now I know why.  So I had to go out and buy black ink to be able to use my printer.
5,:)
5,delivered as promised
5,What I wanted.
5,great buy
5,:)

2,The printer is new to me.  I researched which ink to buy.  I assumed that this pack contained all the cartridges needed for my printer. Nope it does not contain a grey cartridge.  Big help.

5,Perfect.
5,good.
5,Great
5,Very good.
1,The four Ink tanks arrived wrapped in bubble wrap without Canon packaging.  The individual ink tanks appear intact but why not in Genuine Canon 4/pack packaging as pictured?

1,Not like the picture AT ALL. Not like the picture came in a plain white box. They look to be refills not new cannon cartridges. NOT what I ordered .
5,Great
1,Packaging was previously opened and re-taped and 225 cartridge not included.  A rip off and misrepresentation of the product.  What a joker.
3,great
3,does not last long
5,Works great and long lasting on our Canon printer.
1,It took a long time for me to receive the ink.  When I decided to use the ink  the cyan ink begin to leak when I opened it to install it into the printer.  I have not used any of the other cartridges.  I will never buy ink over the internet again unless it is from an national office supply chain.
3,work great
5,Exactly as expected
3,fine
2,Wrong item arrived.  Too late to return
5,Fraction of the price
1,So stupid--I rarely use this Canon MG-8120 but it ran out of ink; looked up on amazon the appropriate ink. Needed to print a bunch of things. Opened theprinter started replacing color for color and saw 4 were not magically going to turn into 6! Can't figure out why they don't sell the whole bunch of 'em.Printer will not operate without all of them having ink. Pretty frustrating!
1,if you have a printer with 2 black tanks get them both because it wont work with only one full tank. it's unbelievable it screwed up it's expensiveIt's CANON!!! never again. for another $20 you can get another printer. all the manufacturers use way too much ink and they are all expensive but these are the worst.
2,Expensive run ouit too quickly
5,Excellent Product
2,wow...did this really come from canon usa....first cartridge I opened leaked all over my hands and had leaked on the other cartridges. Did not return because I bought them three months ago. Wont buy these online anymore.
2,I bought this printer because I thought the ink tanks would be a better choice than ink cartridges. It's not much of an improvement. The whole business is so wasteful and expensive it drives me crazy!
2,This wasn't for my machine at all. I am sure it would work fine for the machines that use it but it shouldn't pop up under other machines connected links if they aren't meant for that machine.
1,I would love to be able to rate this product but the shipping department needs to learn how to package their product for travel...I got a package with a packing slip reflecting 2 items and only 1 was in it the package was so flimsily made that it opened up (not torn open either ) and one of my items never made it.
1,Don't like the new ink cartridges. They are opque black cases that domn't let you see just how much inlk is left to use. The old ones were translucent.???? Much better! Now ther is no way of telli g if you have used all the ink in the cartridge before having to spend another $50 -60 bucks on more ink. What are they hidding????
1,Resist paying such a high price for your ink! Look at Craigslist  or Ebay instead.
5,as expected
1,Today is August 10 2015  I loaded 2 of the cartridges on July 2 2015 and today I'm getting a signal the cartridges are dry.  I have done little to nil color printing I think I was sold a defective product.  What is my recourse?
2,Canon printer uses 5 cartridges not 4.  Had to go to local merchant to get 226 black.
1,I just opened the package today. When I open it I find that there're two inks without the original wrap and they are covered by tape. The product must be opened by someone before and returned back.
1,I ordered this on October 23. I did very little printing in November and none until today (12/27) in December. The 225 cartridge is already out of ink. What exactly did I spend my money on. I already had an empty cartridge before I placed the order. I sure didn't need to pay for another one.
2,Works great but unfortunately these tiny cartridges don't last very long and don't appear to represent good value because of that.
2,Please maje a combo pack with ALL the colors including grey!
2,They suck you into a cheap printer but wack you with the cartridges. Usual story. Buyer do beware!Not pleased.
1,This item is the worst one I've ever ordered thru Amazon. The ink is liquid so as so on I opened it ink liquid was all over my hand my pad on the desk etc.. People should not buy this product! It's not worth it!!
2,Why leave out grey?  That is what we needed most.
1,Price way too high as usual for ink cartridges but what really makes me mad is that you can't buy a pack with all the cartridges in it you have to buy another black one by itself. What a scam these printer manufacturers have.
2,Always too expensive
2,the ink runs out fast and smears when i highlight over it. ink is also kinda pricey for the volume.
1,OVERPRICED!!  CANON INK IS A GREAT PRODUCT BUT THE PRICES ARE RIDICULOUS.  I HAVE RECENTLY PURCHASED A GENERIC CARTRIDGE AND IT IS 1/3 OF THE PRICE AND WORKS WELL.  I WILL NO LONGER PURCHASE NAME BRAND INK.
1,Completely annoying that ALL the ink is Not in this value pack.  Just ridiculous! The canon printer needs a second small black ink refill.5 in all and as you can see from the picture there are only 4 cartridges.
1,If you're expecting to get this package and have the required cartridges to for your printer - think again.Canon in there wisdom is packaging just 4 of the required cartridges - you're left to sort out the 5th one and reorder.
2,Returned them because I'd bought the wrong printer as I stated above about the printer I had purchased with the ink.
1,Two out of the four ink packages had been opened previously (orange plastic twisted off taped back in place). Not new product!!! Don't know yet how long these cartridges will last just installed them.
1,Canon rapes their customers by their stupid ink policies and their stupid ink cartridges that run out of ink every two days. The ink is so expensive. Sometimes I wonder if this s*** was worth it.
1,Note this package does not include the single small cassette of black 26.  For reasons I fail to understand you'll have to buy that separately.
1,canon is junk but the ink did work will too bad the printer did not
1,For as little as I have used my printer I am very disappointed on how quickly the ink ran out (less than 6 months and hardly print anything and never with graphics).
1,The item I received was not what was pictured or described. What I got was a 3 pack of all black inks that will not even work in my printer.
1,The picture shows a Canon package inferring that you get genuine Canon cartridges. Not so!The cartridges I recieved were aftermarket cartridges made in China.
1,It did not come in the original packaging. It was all separated. Did not come in a cannon box like shown in picture.
1,Extremely poor quality. Both this printer and the accompanying ink are useless. The print quality of this ink cartridge is extremely poor. I bought this as a replacement when my black ink ran out. Replaced it with this new cartridge. It is still not working properly and does not print black!
1,My printer has 5 slots for ink. Not sure why this only has four ink cartridges. Now I have to buy ONE ink cartridge. Seriously?
1,I hate paying this much money for replacements.  I can get an entire new printer and ink for the price of this replacement.  But what are you going to do?
1,I put this is my Canon printer and the black ink DID NOT work.Amazon said to bad!!!!
1,My printer has 5 ink cartridges.  This package says it's compatible with my printer in the item description but it is not because it does not include the 2nd black cartridge.  Bummer.
1,Im sick and tired of ink cartridges drying up just sitting in my printer. Canon is a ripoff.
1,The package has the 225 Black cartridge but is missing the more essential one: CLI-226 Black. So it's basically useless. I discovered this after opening the package - big mistake! Waste of money.
1,These tiny cartridges force customers to constantly purchase more.  It's crazy how often I'm buying these and I barely do any colored printing.
1,The yellow ink was open in the package and leaked all over the other inks
1,After being in use less than a week the Cyan cartridge ran out or malfunctioned.
2,I have always stuck with OEM ink because the results and reliability are worth the extra cost to me (plus printer manufacturers are making it increasingly difficult to use non-OEM solutions).However it is beyond dumb to see the combos that Canon is offering for the new line of ink jet cartridges.  If you want to save a few dollars by buying a combo pack you either get this one which does not include the Black or Gray cartridges or you get¬†  Canon CLI-226 BKCMY with PP-201 50 Sheets Combo Pack (4546B007)        ¬†that doesn't include the Pigment Black or Gray cartridges but includes 50 sheets of Canon paper that I do not need (I already have plenty on hand).  It make no sense to not offer at least a 5-cartridge refill kit since all of these Canon inkjet printers require 4 colors plus Pigment Black (not all utilize Gray).  The only rationale would seem to be that Canon gets to line its pockets a bit more than it should.I also have to knock off a star because the new cartridges are opaque which may have been done to thwart refillers but also prevents users from checking the ink level themselves.No wonder so many users go to such lengths to use non-OEM or refill solutions.
1,It was not Canon cartridges it was a generic brand. In otherwise it was not sold as advertised..
1,Went from $42. to $52 in the last 3 months. Considering buying a non-Canon Printer.
1,This product is NOT sold under strict control. Packaging may be damaged items may be non-original and thus MAY damage your printer and invalidate your warranty.
1,Yellow ink and black ink have completely ran out after printing 10 pages
1,Too expensive.  Cheaper ones available by competitors!
1,The blue cartridge was empty when I put it in my printer.
1,Need return slip it's the wrong number. Need number 251.
4,Item was not "factory direct" as advertised and tab came off first cartridge I tried to use. BUT ProPlan had me keep other (unused) cartridges refunded full purchase price AND sent replacement set. Thanks for making it right!
5,"...Please sir may I have some more." In my opinion Dickens paid less for his India ink in the beginning of this industrial masquerade.Great MG5320 canon printer high quality/low quantity ink.Good thing printers are fun to take outside and throw on the ground. Like really hard. These 226 cartridges should come with more ink but they freakin' don't. Someday when the built-in chip starts to fade and the dudes in white suits tell the lizardly leader in his fat CEO chair. Or bosses' big twenty foot long table SFX of sales crickets"It's time to sell more units or this printer will be chucked outside by a (giant Oregon viking half naked frustrated writer/filmmaker/dream shop builder/model railroader nut) with the EPSON HP crapola.ARGH! Thousands of tiny keyboard pieces reflecting in the moonlight the same word: loser loser consumer loser loser...My Chihuahua and Terrier crap out in that gravel too. Little ice and sun hardened turds mixed with bachelor style fractured rock and the happiest cottage in the world with a Canon PIXMA printed sign of two pink flamingos above the words "No drop-ins no religious sales please call Tom don't knock" in the most loving way...Yes I know about PCBs little green plastic stuff my ten pound rat terrier is walking in are dangerous to his little health but so is buying more printers cartridges and so is it wasteful shipping over here to some West coast WAY STATION called MEDFURD! More containers of Yehwhooo crap; printers to Mr Office DEPOT and beyondola!Canon should make a printer that costs $500 dollars more with about 100 built in features less and no DVD less buttons less shine less lights and ONE GIANT FAT cartridge of black or gray.Comes in a little white re-useable bag labeled LIVESTRONG apple or better yet--the best name to ever adorn a product EEEVVVERRR; "CANON"! A FAT COLOR CARTRIDGE in a little white scotch taped bag that costs $500 bucks so I can stop driving over to OFFICE DEPOT and buying more $5000 dollar a gallon ink.
4,Product is great. I continue to think that printer ink from the original manufacturer is overpriced.
1,They really nail you on the catridges.
1,wrong ink for my computer
1,Works very well
1,wrong one
4,This is the first time putting new ink cartridges in my Canon copier and once I found out where it goes the rest was very simple to do. The cartridges installed in a couple of minutes. I have only printed something in black ink since I put in all four cartridges and it printed well. No problems. The seller shipped on time and it arrived sooner than I expected. I would recommend this seller.
4,This is the first time I have bought a Canon printer (MX882) but after the problems with my last HP printer.The Canon ink is bright and works well when printing my photos. It IS EXPENSIVE but so are most other printer inks. Amazon prices are the best I have found for genuine Canon ink and I love the free shipping.
5,The best of printing ink and printers for home use - Canon.  Highly recommend these cartridges as replacement in your Canon printer.  I like the previous reviewer (who erroneously rated a non-OEM product (refill) in his review) have not had good luck with refilling or using non-canon products.  Highly recommend this OEM genuine Canon ink.
5,I'll never buy the cheap ink again.....from now on  it's only the original for me
4,This is the second time I ordered this product for my Canon fax/copier.  Works for me.
5,You can't go wrong with OEM Canon printer inks.  This ink was the latest on the market (chromaLife 100+) and is even superior to the last batch I purchased locally. No problems with this ink.  It is $10.00 cheaper than I have found locally (at B.Buy WalM. OffDep etc) I have also tried aftermarket inks with a brand new Brother printer but never again.  They proved to be inferior aftermarket products (which btw ruined my brand new Brother wireless all-in-one).  It costs quite a bit more but I'm sticking with the brand name this time.  I don't always like doing that especially when I could have saved $20 - 30.00 on the total cost.
5,I have a MG5200 Cannon printer. It is a pretty decent printer. Like all printers it ran out of ink. I buy the name brand stuff even though it is more expensive. But it always fits and works too. You get all 4 colors in this pack and they all fit perfect and worked flawlessly. My color photos look just like the ones you get at Walgreens or wherever. The cartridges last as long as any others.You can save some money buying cheep "Knock offs" but sometimes you do get what you pay for. And you have to be concerned about damage to your printer. All in all I would rather pay a little extra to know that my prints will look good and my printer will work well.
3,Fits my Canon printer perfectly but having to order the gray cartridge separately is a nuisance.
3,Canon has stated the printer will not accept Other Manufacturer's cartridges so I'm afraid to try those.  BUT $60+ for 4 cartridges (that do NOT include the other BLACK cartridge needed) is VERY EXPENSIVE.  Even worse the Canon printer shows "INK LOW" WELL BEFORE at LEAST 100 MORE PRINTOUTS CAN BE MADE so you NEVER KNOW when to ACTUALLY CHANGE cartridges until your printout fades.  In spite of all that the printer itself is GREAT so I put up with these problems
4,Could be five if not too expensive colors are fantastic.
5,This product is an original Canon product. So it works as expected. Beautiful colors. Crisp edging. Performs perfectly. A bit overpriced for an online Amazon product; but hey I got what I expected.Updated February 9th 2013...battery is reliable; does not fail or go belly up without reason. I recharge it every night with a Canon charger designed for the battery. It recharges in several hours and will last almost 24 hours with continuous use before needing recharging. I have since bought several more of these to have a good one on hand at all times.
4,Good  ... But TO EXPENSIVE !!!
2,I used to rave about Canon but no more.  I have both an MP560 and an MX5220.  The printheads look identical but for some reason do not interchange. The printheads are VERY POOR and very overpriced for such junk.  I just ran a set of 20 pages and didn't get through it because the printhead went out in the middle of the job.  I got the stupid message after it quit: "This is not the correct printhead for this printer.  Please replace with the correct printhead." This has happened twice while running a job of multiple copies --- I guess something heats up and burns out. It's not in the printer.  Also the magenta (almost always that color) first stops working on normal quality (the usual magenta missing streaks appear although it still goes on working for awhile with the high quality setting. I guess I've had to replace printheads in the MP560 five times over something like 5 years.  And the MX5220 at about the same rate.  You never know when and there's no warning at all before they burn out.I took one defective head apart just for a curiosity look.  The trouble with magenta clogging became quite evident to me: the ink from the cartridge passes through a microscopic hole through a foam pad between the tube from the cartridge and the plate with the ink jet printout holes. I wondered that ink could that pad even when it was new. Trying to clean will be utterly hopeless if the clog occurs in that foam pad obviously; and the magenta apparently usually does.One other thing the usual answer we get when we get clogging is that we used poor substitute ink.  I can't say that's a lie but my experience suggests if not it's pretty close to being one.  I've found that clogging is much much more likely when a cartridge is allowed to run out of ink. And there's almost no warning about that.  With the opaque CLI 226 cartridges Canon almost guarantees that's going to happen since you can't see the ink level; and the warning llghts don't measure it but rather just count.
5,I want to help offset this review below which is clearly not for this ink but for an ink refill. I just got the MG 5220 today and the photos are absolutely beautiful. I can hardly see any pixels or dots when I print photos. It seems to be doing a find job so far.
5,I'll stick to the canon ink since I love my printer and since it treats me well I treat it well.
5,Fast shipping. Factory boxed ink at reasonable price. Installed in printer as directed to by the instructions. Would recommend the ink .
5,Just what I was looking for. Great product. I have never had a problem with it. Very satisfied with purchase.
5,Affordable ink cartridges! I've been looking for theses since forever! stocked up on them for the office for the next few months!
5,Does what it should...
5,The Canon website has ink cheaper.  I haven't searched for all printers. I have the MG5220.They also FedEx ship for free over $50.00 purchase.
5,Ink performs as promised. I wish there were a reliable off brand because the pricing on this is high but my experience with off brand inks for other Canon printers.
2,This product is great. It works well enough. However it should not cost over $60 let alone over the $40 I was paying a year ago. Explain to me why the price of this product has almost doubled in the past year???? This is ridiculous Canon! You can bet my next printer won't be a Canon I can tell you that much.
4,Can't beat the Canon OEM ink cartridges.  I've tried the cheaper replacement cartridges and these produce better prints by far.
3,My Canon MX882 requires 5 cartridges one more small black one than this package has (the CLI-226). Why why why? The price is insult enough. No reflection on the supplier my ink arrived quickly and it prints nice high quality images. Just one more way they stick it to you.
2,WOW Very very quick shipment when i emailed company however when i saw the correct numbers  and a pack i assumed it included ALL the ink cartridges. it doesn't make sense --it didn't have the small black cartridge but it had the colors and the large black cartridge.  Confused.
2,My wife ordered the replacement ink and they came in 2 days.  When I opened the box I was surprised that the cartridges were loose in a big box. I noticed one of the tab arms that comes off the front is broken off probably from bouncing around in the box. Now I have to return them since the tab is the part with the red light which I assume is needed to function.  Pretty poor packaging if you ask me
2,Ink is To expensive I found a generic ink that is excellent at 1/2 the cost.....
3,This is good ink.  But I will continue to give mediocre reviews to brand-name ink until printer companies stop fleecing us on the price of this stuff.  It's outrageous.
1,Got these.. paid a lot . Used ink?
1,rip off.  These are NOT NEW.  They are refills and mine arrived empty.  Horrible!
3,Ii is very easy to exchange the ink. But the price is expensive. If canon offer us better price for the ink the rate will be 5.
2,Not sure why Canon want to leave the 226 Black out of this Combo set which create some confusion for end user when install the cartridge
1,Unfortunately this doesn't work with pixma model they don't do returns if the box is open. So I wasted money on something useless. Mainly my fault tho.
5,It is Canon so it was perfect for the printer. There was no "value for money" since Canon gives zero discount via Amazon - or anywhere for that matter. As for "Longevity" that is also an irrelevant rating since the "longevity" depends on how much and how often you print. As for shelf-life I have no idea since I buy these whenever I am getting close to running out of current ink. In that time frame I have never had any of these dry up. They don't sit around that long....
5,The ink for my printer arrived quickly.  The price was better than Office Depot and I didn't have to make the trip to get it.  Don't think I will ever go to Office Depot again for printer ink.  Couldn't be more pleased.
5,Quality ink for a decent price (compared to local retail outlets).  Recommend!
4,I would give it 5 stars if they included the grey cartridge.
5,Works for my printer
5,It's quality ink.
5,Good product
5,Worked as good as store bought
3,package itself seems a bit old.  hope cartiages are ok
