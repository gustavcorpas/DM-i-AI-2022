5,3rd update Mar 20 2019:Updating my previous original 2-star rating to 5 stars thanks to their support given and a fully functional replacement device in ~2 weeks.--- TL;DR ---My initial experience from Sep 2018 with my DUO was mixed. I didn't contacted support and wrote my first “quick review” on Dec 2018 or Jan 2019. On Feb 2019 I got contacted by a person from support because my review.Since then the support person 'greatly explained' the causes of the issue and guided through the process for getting a warranty device.I'm very placed with the detailed support given by him and new replacement device works great!--- Device ---My issue from Sep 2018 while RX mode was indeed a defect on some units on the Amazon warehouse from that period which occurred in any codec (SBC aptX and aptX LL).The TX “issue” of audio fading/cutting on low volume (e.g. while playing on Nintendo Switch on low noise scenes) is normal. One must turn all the volume up on the audio source so the device can capture it as the chip isn’t an amplifier but just a transmitter.Due the RX issue I was offered replacement device. Decided to try and upgrade to the Trond DUO S. Now I can confirm the intended correct functionality of RX/TX on both devices (DUO and DUO S) and confirmed the RX firmware defect.Additionally I could test pairing a DUO with a DUO S. They work amazing on aptX LL (Low Latency) which is selected automatically as it’s the best codec available on both. You can easily see and hear the difference between the standard SBC and aptX LL the latter feeling instantaneous on audio visual feedbacks.After 5 months of use and having a fully functional unit...Re-viewed PROS:- Compact goodness.- Good battery duration easy charging and can be left connected.- Easy pairing even multiple pairing (after you get the “trick” for pairing).- Lot of adapters included.- Long satisfaction warranty (18 months) and great support service.Re-viewed CONS:- No configurable low-battery audio signal. It can confuse you from phone alerts etc.- No configurable LED.--- Support and warranty ---They are serious on their support area as they followed me up some time latter from my original 2 stars Amazon review on all my emails until I got the issue solved (on my case a warranty applied until I had it on my hands even though it would need a global shipment).They DO respect their “18-MONTH TROND warranty” additionally from the Amazon return period so you can buy with confidence that any defect will be followed quickly and in great detail. This was getting replied the next day and getting detailed explanations of the cause(s) of my issue along with the possible actions to take.Big thumbs up for Trond. They managed to stand up with the pesky support processes of many other bigger companies out there.--- MISC ---My only complaint could be their webpage. Before making my original purchase I looked up their website and it feels empty and outdated like if they didn’t exist nor could give any kind of quality support in case you got into issues. They deserve a newer and better site that shows and highlights their great client support.-------------------------------2nd update Feb 22 2019:Their customer service contacted me regarding the issues I mentioned here trying to help me with them by proposing a replacement thanks the 18-month warranty.I will try keep updating this review accordingly.------------------------1st Original review:Has been some time that I got this (Sep. 2018) and have been postponing a quick review some thoughts on this device.I have used a few times on various scenarios (playing on Nintendo Switch video watching etc. with different headphones as receivers and different controlled sources as high end phones and laptops).Personal cons:- 1 issue as a receiver.The device is identified as apt-X on my phones but the output audio is awful sounds muffled as phone call quality on all devices that I tried.This reaches the point that the Windows 10 "bells sound" sound test gets very pitchy and gets highly distorted and the very end of the last bells. I would like to provide an example of this by recording the output from the Trond when used as receiver.- 1 issue when transmitting.When transmitting the quality is pretty good BUT when having low volume sounds coming from the audio source the Trond seems to "fade" or cut-out the audio.Playing games on the Nintendo Switch is not enjoyable with some games that have some low-volume scenes since those are intermittently faded or cutted-out. There is no noticeable delay at least from what I can tell (but at this point I just stopped using the Trond both as receiver and transmitter).(As I said the quality is great when transmitting but not sure if it's real aptX quality grade my headphones don't have any indicators of what protocol is being used when receiving audio from the Trond when it's transmitting neither Windows helps with this).Pros:- Super compact portable.- Portable power of ~6 hrs or more.- Quicker setup as receiver.- Can be used always connectedNote that I probably got a defective device but.... Anyways I stopped using it since then (Sep. 2018). It has just a couple of days of usage. Recently I got the time use it again but as a background music receiver as the previously mentioned issues are just annoying.The receiver sound quality is the dealbreaker for me.Maybe is normal for the price just the aptX is there for the short delay feature of the protocol.
5,This is a PREAMP not really a headphone amp.  In RX mode it's meant to send it's output into the AUX or other input of a receiver powered speaker etc.If you want to turn your favorite wired headphones into bluetooth headphones (like I do) you SHOULD use this device in RX mode plugged into a portable headphone amp.  It actually will drive 32 ohm headphones but that will limit the battery life and there is no onboard volume control.  The sound quality will be much better with an external amp.I had no trouble getting the pairing process to work with my Samsung tablet and it worked great for hours after that.  The Trond was in RX mode and it's output was piped into my Topping NX1s analog headphone amp.  The combo sounds very good.  I verified that the bluetooth link was in fact aptX using the developer options on Android.The pairing button also double as a Play/Pause button when in bluetooth RX mode which is handy.Overall a good value for a fairly high quality bluetooth receiver.  A higher end codec like LDAC would sound better but this thing sounds much better than SBC which is the standard audio codec many of these adapters connect with.
4,I use this for a portable scanner radio and I'm happy with it. It has good range it was easy to connect and improves my ability to hear the radio when driving.
5,I wanted to be able to use my television with my Earpods Max and so bought this bluetooth transmitter and connected it to my dish satellite receiver and it works great! Pairs every time I take out my headphones.
4,I have an iPhone 11 and am now able to stream music get directions take calls etc using the speakers in my 2016 Nissan Rouge.
4,Easy to connect to my tv.  pairing to headphones easy.  Must mute TV to silence it.  Just an ever so slight delay in audio.
5,This little device is small but works well… pairs easily when used either as transmitter or receiver…allows Bluetooth connectivity to devices without Bluetooth.
4,I works great!
5,I am happy I bought this! I connected it to my tv so I can workout and watch a movie without disturbing anyone. Although the volume control was a little difficult to use on the blue tooth headset I purchased but I think I figured it out.  I am happy with my purchase
4,It took a couple of attempts to get it setup and connected in TX (transmit) mode but it works. My phone had an existing Bluetooth headset that I wanted to use so I put the phone in airplane mode temporarily while I configured TROND. I'm not sure if this was necessary but at least I got the headset connected to TROND.Now I want to try this at the gym for wireless music where I can leave the iPod in my bag and out of sight. I want to see if I have any issues with other people doing a similar thing with their own wireless devices. I mean it just makes sense that if I try to connect to my Bluetooth device at the same time as someone else tries to link to their device we might inadvertently link to each others devices.I also had to set the volume on my iPod to its MAX setting before I could hear the music where just using wired headset only needs a small fraction of the volume.I have been able to walk around my apartment with only a minor breakup when going around a heavy wall or walking outside.I will come back and update this review if I experience any additional problems.--------------------------------------------Updated 7/15:I tried TROND at both the gym and at the beach. Neither environment was suitable for TROND use. Even with my iPod at MAX volume I could not hear the music over the background noise. Also one side is consistently lower volume even when I switch sides -- which is very annoying. The Bluetooth signal is not very strong. Even when I am only 6ft away if I turn my head at certain angles the signal cuts out completely. If I place TROND in a central location in my apartment there are places I cannot go because the signal cuts out.Personally I don't normally need very high volume so when in my home the TROND volume is at the extreme lower range of what I would find acceptable. But for people who like louder volume this TROND (connected to iPod) is simply not going to be satisfactory.I think TROND is only suitable for use in-home where there are no background noises and all you are really trying to do is be able to listen without a wire connection.I reduced my rating from 4 stars to only 1 because TROND does at least work in the home. Too bad I cannot use it anywhere else.I am going to try to contact TROND support to see if there is anything I can do to boost the volume. I will report back anything I find.--------------------------------------------Updated 8/7:I felt the need to update my review once again. My former Bluetooth headset got slightly damp and the battery corroded so I had to buy a new headset. I bought Mpow Jaws and Vava Moov 28. Both headsets work so much better than the LG HBS 760 that croaked on me. The new headsets not only sound better but they each have volume controls that allow me to further increase volume enough to really cut out the background distractions. So my original problem was with my old LG headset not with TROND. I raised my vote to 4 stars.
3,Pairing was mostly simple. Usually my headphones say "bluetooth paired successfully" but that didn't happen so I wasn't sure at first. It also took a while to figure out if they were paired because the volume is so low. I paired this to my over-the-ear headphones that have volume control on the side. I had turned up the tv volume all the way and it was still too quiet but when I'm wearing these headphones I tend to control the volume with the buttons on the headphones so I just tapped them to see what happened and I WAS able to increase the volume more. So apparently I can control the volume with the remote to the tv AND the headphones but separately like the buttons on my headphones don't control the tv volume the way the remote does. I basically just turned up the tv volume almost all the way and then click my headphone buttons for changes. The sound was a little odd. I put on a show I knew so I could hear the difference; there was more ambience when there was dialogue that then disappeared when the dialogue ceased. The sound quality in general was lower than usual like I was watching a bootleg and proper streaming. So the question is more of do I want that or do I wanna run a twenty foot aux cord from my tv to my head?
4,Using headphones to play along with drums is a must but I wanted to hear what my student hears so I can make sure she was on beat they did seem to have a sliiiiight delay between the 2 possibly because I'm using different headphones? But as far as functionality they work awesome if your just using them for your kids and a DVD player they're perfect...I'd recommend.
4,For what this little device is it works pretty well. I have been using it for a few days as a way to listen to my records while I work in my office which is in the room next to my nice stereo & turntable. The battery life has been good (states 8-10 hrs...it's doing that) it paired up with my BT headphones without too much issues and has good sound quality (wired will always do a bit better but this one is pretty close to wired). There are multiple audio connectors in the box which is helpful for different ways to hook it up.The main negatives are #1 range - they say "30 ft" but quite a few BT devices aren't that good and this one is about the same...the distance I am using it is no more than 15' and unobstructed. 99% of the time it's fine but does cut out once in a while. It is very small so the antenna on it is super small and I am sure that doesn't help. Second if you want to use this as a dual device (two headphones connecting) the low latency aptX codec does not work...it works with 1 headphone but if you pair 2 it will go back down to the slower codecs. They have a different version that can do low latency with two headphones.I also am not a fan of multi-use single button....the one button turns in on turns on/off pairing etc etc. You have to know how long to hold it to pair one headphone two headphones turning it on/off resetting etc. I always get confused. But I am ok with admitting it could just be me and everyone else is ok with it.It is a good solid BT Tx/Rx device and will work great with incorporating BT with my older stereo equipment. I have amps from the 1970s and this is a nice way to add some of the modern day functionality to these great amps so I can use cordless headphones and stream to them. If your wanting dual headphone low latency higher range or need inputs like optical then look at their other products (they have higher end units that can handle extra inputs or headphones). For the price it is doing the job that I intended it to do so no real complaints.
5,I purchased the Trond BT-DUO to use with a 13 year old Toshiba flat screen TV and a set of 8 year old Nokia BT (noise-reducing) headphones something Nokia doesn't even offer anymore.  I am happy to report the Trond in transmit (TX) mode paired immediately with the Nokia head phones.  Once hooked up to the TV I find I am getting excellent audio with no break up or noticeable voice lag.  Turning on the head phones is all it takes to reconnect the BT link.  I'm keeping the Trond powered via the supplied USB cable so I can't comment on the Trond's battery life.  I also am not using it in receive (RX) mode.  The manual describes the procedure for pairing a second device to allow two users to access the same feed but I have no way to test that.If you are wondering I'm still using the TV because it still works well and has a built-in DVD player which I use to watch movies while walking on a treadmill.  I have wireless Sennheiser head phones I set up when I purchased the TV but they are aging out which is why I decided to see if I could switch over to the Nokia head phones by adding BT functionality to the TV.  Given its age the TV's only audio out is RCA jacks.  The Trond package includes a cable with RCA plugs and an adapter for use with the Trond device so hook up to the TV was a breeze. The Nokia head phones use BT 2.1 with A2DP audio so naturally I had some concern as to how well they would play with an AptX device based on BT 5.0.  That has turned out to be a non-issue.I held my breath in ordering the Trond BT-DUO since the first device I tried a cheaper model from another manufacturer would not pair with the Nokia headphones and had to be returned.  I guess you get what you pay for.  The Trond is quite small thinner but not much larger than a 9 volt battery and comes with very clear directions for use.  From what I've seen so far for my purposes it is a 5-star product.Update:  The manual says in transmit mode the Trond can transmit to two separate devices.  I am happy to report this works.  After I paired it to a second set of BT headphones (with the first set off) I turned off the Trond and powered up both sets of phones.  When I powered the Trond back on after a brief delay both sets of phones were receiving the transmission.  This is the procedure specified in the user directions incidentally.
4,Original Review:Maybe I got a defective one but either way the one I got was total s***.In Rx Mode it worked fine so if this is how you plan to use it you should be fine.In Tx Mode pairing failed most of the time. I followed the instructions to a t. Most of the time I would reset the device turn it on in Tx mode and it flash to indicate that it was paired except it wouldn't pair to anything. It would even "pretend" to pair even when there were no Bluetooth devices anywhere close. Pairing mode is supposed to last for 2 minutes before it goes into inactive mode but in my experience it lasted about 5-10 seconds before it would pretend pair -- to what I don't know. Maybe it was getting interference from the WiFi I don't know. Either way pairing would fail at least 90% of the time. Once paired the pairing would generally stick even after you power cycled it so if you only have one bluetooth device that this is pairing to you should be OK if you have the patience to pair it in the first place (good luck)..Pairing a second device is naturally as difficult as pairing a single one. The instructions for this are absurd and complicated. You have to power cycle the thing 3 times in the process and of course it fails to pair half the time. If you do manage to pair to two devices to it though most of the time it won't pair them both simultaneously. You can connect one device but the second will inevitably fail to pair. You can even turn the first one off and then the second one will pair which says that both devices are paired but not simultaneously. In fact after three hours of fiddling I did get it to pair simultaneously twice. Even then when you turn the transmitter off the simultaneous pairing doesn't stick. The two devices will remain paired but you won't be able get them to pair simultaneously again. I don't know where I got all this patience from but I definitely wasted it on this device.In summary pairing as a transmitter almost always fails. Even if it did work the process for pairing two devices is totally arcane. The fact that there is only one button on the whole thing to operate it is probably the reason why the process is so difficult (an endless sequence of double taps and long presses and praying). The only feedback you get on whether the thing is working or not is a flashing LED so you have to memorize the difference between quick blue flashing solid blue slow blue flashing blue and red flashing...Just don't buy it. I wish I didn'tUpdate:The seller reached out and provided me with a replacement unit of the upgraded model. Through some extra time invested I realized a few things.1) My neighbor through the wall has a bluetooth speaker that the transmitter was pairing to instead of my headsets2) The headsets were difficult to pair to even using my phoneUltimately I was able to get this to reliably simultaneously pair and the customer service is really good.
5,I was a little confused when I opened the package after reading the manual. It had all of the basic info for Bluetooth connection from phone to device but not to headsets with out the device. Thru some trial and error I have to say I am extremely pleased. This product does exactly as promised in the add. I found it easy to pair headphones with just pushing the sync buttons on both devices (which is usually the power button) and keeping them with in a foot distance they pair easy and fast. That may vary from head set to head set. Good day all.
5,This is what we needed. It has the correct Bluetooth codecs the right range and plugs into our TV.It does not have independent volume control but we don't need that.
5,I have been hunting down a low latency headset/transmitter combo for a while as many others here. The hunt can get tricky because you have to pair the two devices that will agree to talk in low latency mode. So I took my quest rather seriously and I bought a bunch of headsets and transmitters.For reference I call "slow" connections to those where you can see your video out of sync with your audio. 90 milliseconds or more in delay will do that. Similarly I call "fast" connections where audio and video are reasonably close or in sync with the delay being 30 milliseconds or less.In my experience AptX is a slow codec and the improved AptX-LL is fast.So then any device that does not explicitly say AptX-LL or Low Latency will work slow; a device that only says "AptX" is not enough. And the wireless connection can only go as fast as the slower paired component so having either a slow headset or transmitter will make your sync slow.To make things more interesting not every headset that does say AptX-LL will use low latency technology with every transmitter out there. You kinda have to mix and match. So for example a given transmitter will connect fast with a certain headset but slow with some other brand. And it will do so consistently.Not so the TROND 2-in-1 however. Every headset I tried with this little device worked fast. The headsets include:  Premium MS301 Mixcder Wireless & Wired V4.2 Bass Noise Isolation Headphones with aptX Low Latency Audio- Headset with Mic & Bluetooth - Sturdy Foldable - Universal Compatibility for iPhone Tablet PC          Avantree Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic LOW LATENCY Fast Audio aptX Headset for Gaming TV PC 40h Battery Sound - Audition Pro [2 Years Warranty        ]  Miccus Wireless Bluetooth v4.2 Over Ear Headphones with Mic aptX Headset Low Latency for Gaming TV iPhone Beats Foldable - 20h Battery (SR-71 Stealth)        I tried other headsets but those were not advertised as Low Latency and thus worked slow. Some notable headphones brands are falling behind the low latency race surprisingly.Do not fret however because you can still buy two of these devices use one as transmitter and one as receiver and just use your favorite wired headphones. Yes low latency works quite well that way.You can pair two low latency headsets at the same time but the low latency feature is disabled that way. It is the same on every low latency transmitter I have put my hands on. So if you are planning to do that you can opt for cheaper slower headsets.Aside from latency these devices are well constructed simple to use and most important of all light and small. Single button operation; nice red and blue LED leaves nothing to guess. It behaves like any other standard BT device nice and simple. It almost needs no instructions to set up. The fact that they are transmitter and receiver in the same package only adds to the versatility of this design.All in all great little device. I do recommend it for your audio/video needs when paired with a compatible LL headset or other TROND 2-in-1.
5,Got a big tv without Bluetooth due to a out of control kitty cat in the middle of a cat frenzy my digital audio cable was ripped from my tv breaking the part where you plug it in. I was just about to buy a new tv when I came across this thing. It does exactly what it says it does and once connected it just works.
3,Doesn’t turn off on its own so the first use it ran out of battery.
4,Worked great once we figured out we needed an aux-digital optical cable. If you have a newer TV this shouldn’t be a problem but we were working with an old one 🤷🏼‍♀️
4,These things are neat. They are very compact and light with a generous battery life and a pretty good range. They also come with a USB cable for charging and a double-ended audio cable for physically connecting them in transmit-mode. Initial pairing with devices involves a bit of jiggery-pokery (pro-tip: make sure all your receivers are active and sniffing for Bluetooth before you power up the transmitter) but once that's done they work pretty darn well. I own two of them (one to transmit one to receive) and have no regrets.However I do have two complaints:1) They add their own noises to the signal to tell you stuff like "I am active" "I am connected" "battery is low". These noises are to put it mildly obnoxiously loud. My mom complained about it when we were using them to stream audio to her headphones and now that I have them hooked into my sound system I see why - I just about had a heart attack the first time the receiver blared out the "I am connected" beep and whenever it runs low on battery it gently notifies me by emitting the loudest g**d**n sound that can physically exist in our universe and it keeps doing that every five seconds until you either turn it off or your speakers blow out. Don't try plugging it in to silence it - it will keep on complaining the whole time it is recharging despite the fact that it will happily run off a DC adapter at all other times. This is an audio relay guys not a smoke alarm or a nuclear reactor safety sensor - the deafening repetitive tones are bit excessive.2) I cannot get them to pair with my phone. I bought two hoping one could connect to the phone in Rx mode. If that'd worked I'd have used the double-ended cable to hook it to the other unit that one set in Tx mode. Then I'd have been able to send my phone's audio signal wirelessly to two Bluetooth headphone sets which is what I wanted. That way me and my mom could listen to the phone without disturbing others. No joy - set the phone and device in seek-mode several times but could not get them to acknowledge each other. This probably won't affect you unless you a) have an older phone like mine where the physical audio port is all jacked up from years of being janked when the wire caught on something or b) got suckered into buying some sort of weird hypothetical phone that say has no headphone jack because its makers hate their customers...hypothetically ;)
4,Love the ease of use and the connectivity is great.I did use it as a transmitter for a non Bluetooth tv and it worked great. However it can sound a bit harsh for music.I would still recommend this. I’ve used it for probably 2 years in work trucks that don’t have Bluetooth and I’ve been pretty happy with it
4,The first one had a defect - either the 3.5mm plug was a bit to large in diameter or the AUX port was a bit to small. The result was when I went to disconnect the plug from the unit it pulled out the AUX port guts. The seller replaced it. The new unit has correctly sized plug/port. The new unit has much better volume than the first unit. The first unit required a considerable boost in volume to reach the equivalent wired earphone volume. Unit #2 the volume setting is the same - wired or bluetooth. There is a very slight lag in the audio so if you look at the actors lips closely they are not quite in sync with the audio. If you don't look at the lips closely you probably won't notice the lag. I am very happy with it - I can watch a DVD and exercise without being physically connected to the portable DVD player.
5,IT WORKS...PRICE IS RIGHT
3,Other than having a shorter range than other Bluetooth items I own it is a good product both on the recieve and transmit modes.
4,Sleep mode makes this unit something you have to power on instead of something you hook up and forget.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I love the quality of this device. It was very easy to pair with my sound bar and I love the fact that you can put it on either receive or transmit mode. I’m currently using it to transmit signals from my record player to the sound bar and it works great. The only downside is I cannot get my iPhone to detect it when trying to use it in my car.
4,the company was very responsive to my questions. I'm enjoying tv again without blasting my wife out of the room.  It's plugged into the earphone jack on my receiver works great so far about a month....
5,I bought another brand last week and I couldn't connect my Bose headphones or my Samsung earbuds. With this one the connection was super fast at the first try and with both headphones. The audio it's perfect and have a minimal delay.  I'm super glad that now I can listen to my series instead of reading them so I don't wake up my boyfriend.
4,I am using this little device to connect my Nintendo Switch with Sony WH-1000XM2 headphones. I have it powered via a USB power adapter so cannot speak as to the advertised battery life. Works very well with no noticeable latency and the sound quality is pretty much as good as my corded Sony MDR-1R when plugged in via an amp (my previous Switch setup).One thing to note is make sure you turn on your bluetooth device/headphones before turning on the TROND if you do not you will have to go through re-pairing as it seems to lose pairing if you turn the TROND on first.I had an idea to order another of these to use with my electric Violin but alas after trying it the latency is way too high to use with something like an instrument. I don't know if this is because of the Violin itself because as mentioned the Switch sound has no noticeable delay. Not a knock against this device as this is not what it was designed for but thought I would mention it in case you were considering one for this purpose.Comes with everything you need to get started though I caution against using the USB cable with a USB wall adapter (such as your phone one in my case a Samsung charger). When doing this there was a large amount of static heard through the TROND. I solved this by using a dedicated USB power brick an Amazon Kindle charger.All in all a great device very small (about 1 1/2"X1"X1/4") and has the added feature of being a receiver as well if I ever has a use case for that scenario.Recommended!
5,I bought this item in 2018 and it has been working very well but I forgot how to pair to a new device so I googled it and it brought me to an Amazon instruction video which did the trick. Thought I would leave a review. I bought this originally to play music from my phone to my 2007 Prius which doesn't have the capability to stream music from my phone. My Prius can do bluetooth calls but not music. This fixed that easily. Now I use it to play sound from my mothers TV cable box to a Google Nest Mini speaker right next to her couch so she can hear the TV better without cranking up the TV volume for the whole neighborhood to hear. Works great. Right now I'm testing weather or not it stays on when the cable box is turned off so she won't have to think about turning on the transmitter everytime she watches TV. If I think of it I'll post the results on here.
3,I like how small and light this is.  I am using it to send audio from a VR headset to my larger stereo system.I specifically got two of these so that I could ensure I had low latency audio rather than risk just using one of these with another device.While the audio I get is low latency its definitely not "ultra low latency" to where you can not tell there is a delay.  I hear a difference in the audio from the build in headphone speakers and my audio system.  But the delay is acceptable and perhaps the best you can get for bluetooth.The major issue I have really is the volume.  Mid volume from any audio source is enough to throw a block party on my stereo from any source but not this!  I have to turn it up to about 90% just to get acceptable audio levels.Now this has already happened once: I left the volume up loud and changed the source to something different and nearly blew up my speakers.Since I have two of these thinking maybe just one of them is defective with its output levels I already switched them around with the same thing.The other annoyance is that you would think they would remain paired with another but every time I turn them on I have to re-pair them.  I am really surprised I figured two units would work really well with one another.So I am going to use a in-line amplifier to fix my low signal issue and I disconnect the built in VR sound to get around the echo I hear from the latency.The best thing I can say is this unit seems to be identical to about 4 or 5 other units on Amazon just branded differently and this seller has the best price with all the included accessories for connection so it was the best value of the bunch.
4,i wasnt expecting a miracle and i cant tell there might be like 80-120ms lag but its so close that it only bugs me if im watching a video and you can see the peoples mouths moving and im TRYING to catch it being out of sync. much smaller than i was expecting im excited to see what it can do over time
4,My 10+ year old iPod Classic with 6000 songs is now able to connect to my Megaboom3 smart speaker.  I read the reviews before buying and I will admit READ THE DIRECTIONS and you will succeed in TX mode.  I have not tried RX mode as I do not (yet) need it.The sound is good not great but that may be due to the output on the iPod not the Bluetooth input.  I adjust sound and volume on the iPod first then on the smart speaker for best sound quality.If you have "old school" devices you love but they lack Bluetooth  this device is well priced and delivers results!  Outside of replacing old devices just to get Bluetooth  the Trond is a great solution!
5,I have used other dongles in the past and thought the light static and other small background noise was just inherent to bluetooth connectivity from my TV to my headphones until I bought this one and all of that noise completely went away leaving me with exceptionally clear sound quality with 0 noise. I would definitely recommend this unit
5,Purchased to use in TX mode to allow a 6 year old Samsung LED TV to connect to my Bluetooth earbuds for private listening. Overall I am very happy with the product and especially pleased with the quick and helpful responses from customer service. I would not hesitate to purchase this product again. The following review which I hope others will find to be helpful reflects my experience and impressions with the TROND BT TX/RX.On initial setup I was not receiving sound to the earbuds. I immediately emailed TROND Customer Service. Bruce responded promptly and courteously in the same day with troubleshooting steps and follow-up responses to address the issue which was ultimately resolved as a error on my end. During the troubleshooting Bruce also allowed for the possibility of a defective device (it wasn't) confirmed that the device was covered for 18 months and offered to replace it if that was the case.Correctly set up the TROND transmits sound as advertised. The sound is more than satisfactory and I attribute any limitations in this application to the earbuds rather than the TROND TX/RX. Latency is negligible between my TV and my earbuds. After the initial pairing the connection between  my TV and earbuds is very fast.Things to be aware of:  Since the TROND TX does not show up as a paired BT device as it would on your phone or tablet I have to power off either the TROND or the earbuds to disconnect. If I want to use my earbuds with other paired BT devices I keep them out of range of the TROND or it will grab the BT connection if it is powered on. I also have the TROND USB connected so that it is connected to power at all times. The only volume control is through the paired device (earbuds phone tablet etc.).
4,I bought these to use with my in-ear monitors but there’s a slight delay in the signal. Any other application this would be fine but not in a live music situation.Outside of that these actually work quite well. I’m using it as a Bluetooth receiver on my laptop so I can use a wireless headset for meetings listening to music etc. Sound quality is quite good. I haven’t tried the transmitter function as of yet because I don’t have a use for it but I do like that function.If you’re looking for an inexpensive way to use Bluetooth headphones with a device I would recommend this product.
4,I bought this unit months ago to use as an aptX BT receiver for a nice headset and premium self-powered speakers playing mostly wav files. That was a mistake. And is why it gets four stars?  I bought it based on "..... Bluetooth Transmitter Receiver with aptX & aptX Low Latency....." text in the first feature bullet of the listing.  CAUTION --- These words in the listing are misleading. I've emailed Tron asking them to correct this text (and received a replay in less than an hour) so it may change.  Later in the details it is indicated that the unit is aptX only in transmit mode but that was too little too late for me.  I jumped after seeing the above noted text and the excellent reviews.If you don't need aptX for the highest audio quality or the aptX low latency for TV watching or will use this only as a transmitter in an aptX setup it's a great unit.  The audio quality is the best I've experienced even when used as a BT receiver (i.e. without aptX).I recently got the newer TROND DUO S that has aptX in both transmit and receive modes.  While I want and now have aptX audio quality at both ends of the BT connection for music listening I have to say that the improvement is not night and day.  It's there but it's subtle.  If you are playing just typical quality MP3 files you might not hear the difference. Though for the modest price difference I think it's worth getting aptX (you need aptX at both ends). Get the S unit if you want aptX in receive mode (for audio quality or low latency).I used the DUO and am now using the DUO S with an AZIO BT 4.0 aptX USB mini dongle in my laptop. The CSR BT stack that comes with the AZIO provides a huge BT feature set.  The best $14 I've spent in a long time.
5,Note: THIS model not equipped with volume control.  This is a straight forward easy to install external blue tooth transmitter.  I use it to power my bone conduction wireless headphones.  I can walk out to the car and still hear my news programs.  I use these headphones to give my ear canals a chance to dry cool and 'relax' without my hearing aids in place all day.  Previously I was wearing the aids for about 15 hours a day.  Ran through a lot of batteries.  Now I can use the headphones for 6 - 8 hours a day.  The headphones are recharged daily.
5,This is so small but so much useful. No more disturbing your partner while watching your series or movies.we easy to install and no voice lack it's so clear. Highly recommended
5,It was a bit tricky. Best option was to use the double aux headphone wire that was included (3.5m) and direct connect to TV then turn of the rv built in speakers. Pair 1 blue tooth speaker. Turn it all off and pair to the 2nd speaker. Once that was done we had great sound and volume adjusted on each speaker. Cost less than $65 to get a semi stereo surround sound set up. And very happy with it.
5,Best one I've been able to find. Serves all purposes I need it to. From sharing Bluetooth audio to my speaker from projector to making any device Bluetooth receiver.
4,Does what I wanted it to which is listening to movies so I don't disturb anyone else at night. The only issue I have had is a slight lag between the sound and the picture. It's very slight and is barely noticeable. A solutions for modern listening devices. Hopefully this will be built in to televisions soon they have added everything else but a simple feature like this.
4,UPDATE: After further testing in Receiver mode I have found that these do in fact have significant low latency. I was contacted by TROND customer support who informed me that the Sony headphones in fact do not have a low latency bluetooth codec. aptX Low latency is a fairly rare bluetooth codec for headphones to have. So be warned that you DO need aptX low latency headphones. I will be ordering a second one of these to test pairing them to each other. Updated to 4 stars for now.ORIGINAL: This product was advertised as "Low Latency" down to 40ms. After many tests I can conclude it is not low latency.  It says in the manual that you need a atpX low latency headphones to get low latency down to 40ms. I tested this product with 5 different pairs of bluetooth headphones in transmitter mode including the industry leading Sony WH-1000XM3 which are listed on the aptx website as a certified aptx product. All of them had about 150ms+ of latency. This is pretty significant for playing a game. especially ones that require reactions and button presses. This is unfortunate because I have been searching hard for a good Bluetooth transmitter and this one was very compact and easy to set up. The search continues.
3,*** Edited to add:  I may have found the trick to help them connect better.  Instead of just turning on the headphones and expecting them to connect to their last connection if you hold down the power button longer on the headphones until it enters pairing mode then just quick press the button on this transmitter it seems to reconnect pretty quickly.  (at least so far.  It's worked a few times)These have great range and sound quality in transmit mode.  I don't use the receive mode.The downside of these for me is they are a pain to reconnect to headphones after they are turned off and back on.  Also sometimes it seems to connect but doesn't play the audio but I'm not entirely sure if that is the combo of this transmitter with my headphones.The price of the device is good.
5,Can hear my television quietly now.  Instructions are confusing but easy to do.  I still have not been able to get stereo or both earphone at the same time.
5,UPDATE:I bought a second one to use them as a transmitter/receiver pair. The latency is low but still noticeable so it might not be good for every purpose (like broadcasting/recording). But for streaming the latency has no impact. I remain pleased with my original one after a year of ownership.----I have used this as a transmitter and as a receiver. It works well in both modes. Easy pairing and the output in receiver mode is powerful enough to drive a set of headphones. In transmitter mode I use it to stream the output of my audio mixer to a pair of Bluetooth headphones when I need to move around a bit. Comes with a short 3.5mm male-to-male adapter (for close-in use) a 3.5mm male-to-male patch cord (for those times when the unit needs to be further away from your amplifier) a male-RCA-to-3.5mm adapter cord and a USB-A to micro-USB cable (for charging). The only thing I can't fully comment on is the battery life since I've only used it for an hour or two at a time. But for that purpose it is fine. Recommended.
4,First I will state that I only needed the transmitter for use with my metal detector. Nothing else. I say that because there were not many search results for this application. I went out on a small limb and purchased this model knowing that if it didn't work for me I could send it back at no cost to myself. (hence the "small" limb)  After some trial & error I eventually got the signal I was hoping for on my wireless headphones. My only suggestion to the manufacturer would be BETTER INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE WITH METAL DETECTORS AND THE WIRELESS HEADPHONES WE USE. I'm not shouting here only emphasizing my observation..
4,Works good no noticeable delay from tv to the sound in my ipods.  Using it with an older tv and ipods in a workout room.
5,This work great.  It will loose connection if not used all the time.  But is very easy to reconnect.  I have had up to 3 devices paired.
5,Paired the Trond device with my bluetooth earphones to allow listening to TV audio output without tethered cabling.  This enabled watching TV without disturbing household and flexible movement away from TV. However the device volume was very low and unresponsive to TV or headphone volume adjustments. Contacted Trond Customer Support per email.  Response was timely constructive and very satisfying. Replacement device was received within a few days and it has worked perfectly. The sound quality and range has been great. Device performance coupled with customer support makes this a great buy.
5,NOTE: this offers AptX low latency only when paired with a single device that supports it.  Therefore this will either transmit to 2 bluetooth devices OR in AptX low latency mode but not both at once--if you need that capability check out TROND's larger receiver/transmitter: https://www.amazon.com/TROND-Bluetooth-Transmitter-Receiver-Digital/dp/B075Z11F4Q/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1538663709&sr=8-3&keywords=bt+duo).This is the smallest of TROND's Bluetooth transmitter offerings and performs well in all of its advertised roles.  I must emphasize how unobtrusive this thing is--if you need to turn a device into a transmitter or give it reception capability this will allow you to do that with nearly zero added space or weight.  The internal battery also serves this purpose well by eliminating the need for a constant power cable.  The included manual is extremely well written and informative especially considering the standard for this sort of product.By the same token do not expect elaborate bells and whistles.  Miniaturization has its tradeoffs.  There are two controls: a switch to change between transmitting and receiving mode and single power button which doubles as a pairing button.  This is no big deal when using it as a receiver or as a transmitter paired with 1 receiver.The process for pairing this with 2 receivers is a bit more cumbersome however and may require a few attempts.  If you are planning on doing this once and leaving it as is (connecting a TV to transmit to 2 bluetooth headphones for instance) then this may not be a problem.  If you plan to regularly re-pair with different devices however you should probably choose TROND's slightly larger model which comes with a separate pairing button as well as a higher capacity battery and fully supported AptX low latency when transmitting to 2 devices (assuming those devices support AptX low latency): https://www.amazon.com/TROND-Bluetooth-Transmitter-Receiver-Digital/dp/B075Z11F4Q/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1538663709&sr=8-3&keywords=bt+duoAs before this device does precisely what it says and it does it well in a very small package.  Make sure you understand your needs before purchasing and read TROND's product page carefully as they are very thorough about what this does and does not do.
5,Love this! Now I can use my favorite headphones to hear movies better. A must buy.
2,I used this device to pair a record player/stereo to a bluetooth speaker across the room. I followed the directions and had the speaker close to the device while in pairing mode. But then when it paired I moved the large bluetooth speaker across the room where it would be staying. But then the next time I powered everything up to use it this device was no longer paired to the bluetooth speaker. Is that normal? Makes it kinda useless because I'm not going to lug this large bluetooth speaker over to my record player to re-pair it to this device every time I want to listen to my records. Very disappointed. Going to try to see if I can return it.
5,I had previously purchased an identical item under the name 'Taotronics': same form same functions everything but the logo.  It lasted a few months and was a nightmare each time to get it to connect.  Sometimes it would take 5+ minutes of fiddling with it before it would work.  Thankfully I was hooked on the functionality and when it died I searched for a replacement.  This 'Trond' transceiver/receiver has worked flawlessly out of the box for 5 months now; links with my Mpow wireless headphones in 2 seconds.  Syncing is not a major issue when watching movies...unless the speaker talks really really slowly (picture Jason Bateman trying to get Will Smith to say 'Good...Job').  Would (and should) buy another as a backup should this one ever fail.  Excellent value for the price!
4,This thing works well for one pair of headphones but distorts sound and eventually drops the other set of headphones. Bought it for our Tahoe rear entertainment system and ended up having to plug one set of headphones in through the wired port. Disappointing since it says you can pair two sets of headphones to it. I also tried it in our house with the same results. Just in case an auto application was an issue. Does not pair to two devices well.The reason for the 4 stars is the customer service from TROND. Bruce contacted me immediately about the issue and even sent me another device and offered to refund some of my money. Amazing to find a company that stands behind their product in this day and age. Thank you Bruce.
4,Updated on Oct. 14 2021After communicating with the TROND support team the issue has gone.Please don't connect its 3.5mm aux jack and USB charging port to the same audio source as it may easily cause "ground loop noise". Please use a separate USB charger instead. It doesn't make static noise.===Origianl Feedback written on Oct 13. 2021Subject: wastedWhile charging there is too much noise. It makes me a headache.
3,This device seems to work pretty well in receive mode but I purchased it to transmit from non-bluetooth devices such as my mp3 player to my bluetooth headphones earbuds and speakers. The problem is that if the input falls below a certain volume level the sound I hear in my headphones or speakers fades out. Worse if the volume of one side is lower than the other and it is below the lower limit the low side will fade out completely while the other side continues playing. This results in eratic output volume levels and wildly shifting stereo sound especially on TV shows or audio dramas. Music with varying volume levels will also be affected in a very bad way. Note that if listening to narrated non-dramatized audiobooks there is little to no delay when the transmission starts so such volume changes are not likely to be as noticeable. But anything with varying recording levels will be negatively impacted by this problem. I can only recommend using this as a transmitter when the input volume is extremely consistent or when the headphones or speakers have their own volume that can be set very low while the input device is set very high. On the positive side the battery life of something of this size is actually not bad and the male to male 3.5mm audio adapter wit no cable is very good to have especially when connecting this to very small devices such as mp3 players or small radios or when using it to connect non-bluetooth headphones with detachable cables to phones or tablets.
5,I have been using the device now for over one month.  I use it with my new LG V20 smartphone which as I understand supports aptX technology.  I use it only as a receiver in receiver mode in conjunction with my old Sony headphones.  I noticed that by plugging in my headphones to the V20 jack I was loosening the female connection inside the phone case - this was starting to result in connection noise.  This was not a issue with this phone only ( V20 is two months old ) rather it was an issue with my Samsung G S3 also.  I suspect it is an issue with most smartphones with slim case widths - in that there simply isn't enough room to support the mechanical foundation to allow for a female receptor that can withstand repeated insertion and removals.  And yes there is ( in the case of the V20 ) a subtle but noticeable slight " click " when the headphone jack is inserted into the V20 fully.Well must say the TROND device works great to this point - just as the instructions explain.  The audio is wonderful volume is adjusted by the up/down buttons on the phone side AND the TROND works with a USB charging cable plugged in all the time.  I used the TROND several times at first without keeping the USB charging cable plugged in.  With intermittent device use was having to recharge TROND after two days usage.  TROND is so small and lite it is amazing that it does all the functionality as claimed ( again receive mode usage with a V20 ).For the price this is THE route to go IF you want to use your existing headphones ( not Bluetooth rather cable and male jack ) AND your phone supports aptX.I wonder if TROND would consider an even newer model with increased battery life even if it meant the device would grow in physical size OR perhaps a super TROND that could act as battery backup for a cell device as well as supporting all the existing functionality ?
5,I tried close to 10 of these bluetooth devices.  Some of them were ok. Some were terrible. This one had a few peers in quality but not in size and price.  This thing is tiny.  I use it in my car.  See pics attached. It's size is unobtrusive and hardly noticeable and works real well where I've mounted it.  Which is right next to my aux input and cigarette lighter jack.  I bought a short (6") USB 2.0 A Male to Micro B USB cable (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B013G4EAEI).  It comes with a similar length aux cable. And together it creates a nice little setup that no ones really notices. I mounted it so that you can somewhat see the single button on the device. That button lights blue/red when you put it into pairing mode (holding the button for about 5 seconds).  That button is so flush with the device you really can't feel it or know when you are actually depressing it.  So it's important to be able to see when the color changes to the blue/red almost purple color. That means it's ready to connect with your phone.  And yes you have to reconnect to it every time you get back in the car.  Which is the only unfortunate "feature" about it.  But I didn't find a single bluetooth device that would auto-reconnect after losing power in the car.  Actually it doesn't even lose power because it stays connected to the cigarette lighter power.  But the device turns itself off.  So when I get back in the car I have to hold the hard-to-feel button for about 5-6 seconds and then my phone connects on its own.  Unless someone else was last connected to the bluetooth device then sometimes I have to go into my bluetooth setting (I'm using an iPhone) and tell it to reconnect. But that is not often.  And it doesn't have to stay connected to the power in the car but for me there is no sense to ever have it unconnected.  So it just stays "charging" all of the time.  Overall it's a nice little quality piece of tech.  I chose it over a bunch or more expensive units (and some cheaper ones).  Don't hesitate to buy it if you need simple and solid.
4,the unit works fine with our TROND TD-B01 headset.  Latency seems to be exactly as advertised.  There is no discernable lip-sync lag when watching video but if the external volume is up high you can hear that the regular speaker sound arrive to your ear very slightly before the headset sound.  This hasn't been a problem because my wife has good hearing.  She listens to the video through speakers while I use the headset and she prefers to listen to video at a fairly low speaker volume anyway.  The device pairs with the headset reliably and easily every time.Works well except for one problem complaint that battery useful life is short.  The usable life per charge is described as being "up to" 8 hours.  In my experience using the device in transmit mode only we get a usable time of only about 4 hours per charge which is too short to be acceptable for our use.When I contacted TROND customer service about this battery life problem they responded fast and well.  They apologized for the puzzling defect and sent an immediate refund.  With the refund I purchased the slightly larger TROND version of this device that is advertised as incorporating a 500 mAh battery (compared to the 160 mAh battery in this device). and advertised to provide up to 20 hours of transmit mode use per charge.All turned out perfectly well.
4,This is a great product.  Much smaller than I expected.  It's a nice design although I'm not sure how long the soft touch paint will hold up to normal wear and tear.  I was surprised that there was a disposable clear plastic protector sheet on the glossy plastic surfaces.  Looks much better after those are removed.Battery life is the only reason I gave this 4 stars.  I experimented with it the first few days of use and was only able to get about 6 hours continuous instead of the advertised 8 hours.I am mostly using this with a computer at work that I can't install drivers for a USB Bluetooth transmitter to connect to my headphones.  I had a problem with ground loop interference when I had both the 3.5mm audio cable and USB charging cable plugged into the computer.  It sounds infinitely better after I plugged the charging cable into a separate wall charger and not into a USB port in the computer.  This is probably more an issue with the computer than this device but it's something to keep in mind if you notice some bad static/feedback when plugged into a computer.  I have also used it as a receiver for ear buds at the gym.  It has a good range so you can leave your phone somewhere central and move around to different stations as you exercise.  This device fits nicely in a pocket and is so light I barely notice it's there.
4,I bought this device to be used as a receiver to plug into a Bose Wave System that did not have Bluetooth built in. Wanting to stream music from my phone to the system I called Bose and a rep advised to purchase a device that could be plugged into the aux input and receive Bluetooth signal. After reading various reviews I settled on the  TROND Bluetooth V5.0 Transmitter Receiver. When I got it I followed the instructions and voila! My Bose Sound Wave was now Bluetooth capable. It works very well as a receiver; I have not used it as a transmitter. The sound quality is slightly diminished (highs mostly) but it still sounds very good; hence the 4 stars in sound quality. I'm not sure about battery life as I haven't used it enough to test this which is why I rated it 3 stars though it may warrant more or less after I've used it enough.  So far I'm I'm very satisfied with the product and how it works. It also comes with all the different cables that you may need to connect to your device tv whatever.
5,Ordered yesterday. Received today.I’m using it with TREBLAB Z2 headphones.It paired easily once I told my phone and my laptop to forget these headphones otherwise it didn’t.The sound is excellent and it’s totally synced up. No lag. No delay.So far. So good. And so convenient to not have to worry about volume of the tv at critical times any longer.I will update if necessary but so far it’s great.
5,I use Trond to connect and non blue tooth TV to a blue tooth head set. It paired very quickly in the first try. The is no feeling of latency. Happy with the product.
4,I use this transmitter for TV sound it works as advertised. The manufacturer warns that you need a compatible AptX LL headset to reduce latency. They were right. Paired with my cheap Bluetooth earbud latency was awful. They recommend their own low latency headset but it doesn’t appear to be available (the reason for 4 stars rather than 5). I bought a second unit and paired it as a receiver with the first and connected my wired Apple earbuds. That works great. Recommended as long as you deal with the latency in some manner.
5,A TRAVEL GURU that's who recommended this to me. I've always been irritated at the use of wired earphones on airplane seats as the wires plugged into the seat would get (magically) tangled when I drift off to sleep. Why haven't we implemented the use of Bluetooth compatible airplane seats yet? Nevertheless I decided to find a Bluetooth transmitter to pair between the airplane seat and my AirPods 2 voila! Perfect fit!-Sound quality: I didn't notice any sound quality issues with the use of this device and if there were any it was due to the sound system from the airplane itself during movies and shows. However I did notice that the sound quality had issues when a flight attendant or pilot made an in-flight announcement (pretty sure it's an airplane issue) so be sure to take out your earphones and listen up when the sound drops (not the bass).-Bluetooth connectivity: It worked....PERFECTLY. Didn't find many other reviews nor devices that were cost efficient enough (come on it's just a transmitter chip and converter) that would allow me to just use it for the sake of going wireless on a plane ride. Be sure to test your listening device with this BEFORE your trip so you won't have a hard time on the plane pairing them together.-Battery life: So long as you're not flying a plane ride that's more than 6 hours you shouldn't have any issues at all (although I'm sure it could go a bit longer). The device does allow you to charge and play at the same time so you shouldn't have any issues on the plane with it running out of juice.
5,Essay to t pair to multiple headphones
3,So everything about this works/sounds great. My wife and I are using this with two pairs of Apple AirPods. Sync is pretty good a little bit of latency but usually not a problem.But here is a problem: If you're watching TV/Movies and it gets to a quiet part of a scene the audio will cut out until something loud happens! Totally destroying the moment and taking you out of the film because all background sound cuts out too (birds wind etc.).Support was helpful and even sent me a replacement but it's a problem with the technology in the device so the problem was the same. Again support was great and checked in and gave me a refund when I told them the problem was still present. So five stars for support! If you only watch loud action films like "Transformers" or something you may not even notice! On "MIP Fallout" it rarely happened.One tip I learned from support that may or may not work for you (it did not work for me because I'm using AirPods): If you turn your device that you're playing/streaming video from up really loud (maybe 3/4) and then turn the output down (if possible) on your headphones then that will keep the audio from cutting out. But if you can't turn it down (like me) it's not an option.If they figure out how to fix this issue I'll be back for BT DUO 6.0!
5,Can't describe how happy I am with this product.I ordered this with crossed fingers hoping it could transmit sound from a early-2000s-era receiver connected to a 1990s-era 100-disc Yamaha CD changer to 2 Bluetooth speakers. I had one small Ecoxgear speaker placed in my front yard about 15 feet from receiver through one living room wall. I had a larger Ecoxgear speaker on my rear deck about 25 feet from the receiver through a wall between a living room and stairwell and through a wall between the kitchen and deck. Was concerned here about the range and transmission of sound.Granted because of the walls I couldn't take it much further than I had hoped (Bluetooth generally will only go about 33 feet with range anyways) but it did work through two walls in an older home. Really feared it wouldn't but it did. This speaker also was not on a direct straight line but more of a direct to the transmitter's left line.It's also pretty simple to set up and extremely small. But the results for me were fantastic. It's only been a few days of use so far but I would highly recommend the product to anyone.The transmitter/receiver also arrived on time and I had reached out to a TROND representative after ordering to share my concerns. He was very helpful - even a little doubtful honestly - about the transmitter/receiver doing what I wanted it to do. But there is a 30-day return policy and again it worked for me so I won't have to use it.The keys are to: 1) Charge the device and whatever Bluetooth devices you'd like it to connect to fully. 2) Follow the instructions included in the box the device comes in. 3) Know the range you will have using Bluetooth transmission (about 33 feet; less if there are barriers).It has not been used as a receiver but that was not my primary purpose for ordering it. Still it did the job and am very happy.
4,The only reason I did not give it 4 stars is because the short auxiliary cable that came with it was the worst garbage I've ever seen. It was like rabbit ear antennas for an old tv where it only worked in the exact right position and if you bumped it the feed would get static or cut out.The transmitter/receiver works wonderfully well ever since I replaced the aux cable with a better quality one. I have no problems with sound quality. Battery life lasts longer than my wireless earbuds that it transmits to which is more than 6 hours. I think the transmitter/receiver lasted somewhere between 8-10 hours continuous use when I tried it. Now I just charge it every time my wireless headphones need charged.The only small problem that occurs very infrequently is it sometimes doesn't sync with my bluetooth wireless earbuds. I don't know if that is the fault of the transmitter/receiver or the earbuds. When it happens I shut it off plug it in wait till it's fully charged then try again and it usually works. I have to have my earbuds on and ready to sync before I turn the transmitter/receiver on though otherwise it'll go into "cannot find bluetooth device" mode until I turn it off and back on again.I have not used it as a receiver yet but it works great for bluetooth transmission.The range is fantastic as well. It works probably 50m in an office setting and at least 30m through one wall.
4,UPDATE - Company sent me a replacement unit tested and worked much better than the original one I had.  The sound quality and connection was much better.Originally I was hearing a hiss sound on my Oculus 2 Menu and it was only on certain button sound. It was hardly noticeable with the replacement. I think 90 percent of the people won't notice it.  I get over 20+ meters before it disconnects with walls. Great Customer Service and I will buy from them again.There is still a cut out at low volume with my Oculus Quest 2 and headphone but putting the volume all the way up on the Oculus and controlling the volume from headset resolves the issue. I guess this is a way to save money.  Only happens on my Oculus though.
4,There are plenty of reviews about this item already so I'll focus on the most important issue for me.  I wanted to pair this with Bose QC35's for the specific purpose of using with a Sony XBR-X750D since Sony has chosen for some reason not to implement A2DP on their Bluetooth stack in their TV's (very bad decision on their part but that's a different review).  There are conflicting reports about whether the TROND provides proper audio sync with video given that the Bose QC35's don't support low latency Bluetooth.  I'm sorry to state that while the delay is minimal (I'd estimate 200 to 300 milliseconds) and the brain can ignore that much delay for speech (although it is slightly tiring) it is obvious during sports or action filled movies.  When a quarterback claps his hands to signal a snap the sound is noticeably delayed.  It's not baseball season but I'm sure the crack of the bat will be problematical as well.  Likewise gunshots or footsteps.I've just received this item and have to decide if I can handle the delay or not but I suspect this bothers some more than others and thus the conflicting opinions.  Obviously for non-video applications this is not an issue the sound appears to be fine and there are no dropouts within 20 feet of my TV with the TROND hanging behind the TV.  And it's not the fault of the TROND- it does have low latency support.  I just want all QC35 owners (and potential buyers) to be aware of the ramifications of Bose's decision not to implement it.
5,installed on a used old bose. works as directed
2,This item did not work for me at all. I needed to send a signal ~15'-18' to a Bluetooth speaker.  About 12' (line of sight) was the best it would do. Walls and other obstacles killed the signal completely. The good thing was the no-hassle return through Amazon.Update (response from TROND):Hi RobertWe've noticed that you left a product review on May 27 and complained that TROND BT-DUO Bluetooth V4.1 Transceiver couldn't transmit the signal across the distance of 15'-18' with blocking walls. This has led you to return it back to Amazon as a result.Please be informed that Bluetooth technology can support up to 10m or 33ft ONLY if without any blocking walls or obstacles. That's the way all Bluetooth devices work; or more specificly it's actually the Bluetooth chipset maker - CSR that can allow all the makers of Bluetooth devices to do. And there's really nothing that we as a brand can do about it. I hope that you could understand that. Please keep that in mind if you'd like to purchase any Bluetooth products in the future.RegardsTROND Customer Care******************************How strange. The Bluetooth that came installed on my cell phone transmits a signal to the same place just fine. But the cell phone has no provision for hooking up my home stereo. Your product gave up at 12' line of sight.robbie***************************Hi RobertMaybe the cellphone is able to send our stronger signal than the Bluetooth transmitter. It's kind of similar to the fact the different phones with the same carrier may pick signals with different bars.RegardsBruce - TROND Customer CareNow I am very confused. In your first message you said that all Bluetooth devices work the same way - that that's the limit of the chipset. Now you're saying that my cell phone might have more power. Sorry but you can't have it both ways. Face the facts - your transmitter doesn't do what you said it would do.robbieHi RobertI don't know how to better explain it but the 33ft distance is the theoretical maximum working distance for Bluetooth technology which may be greatly affected by the surrounding environment such as blocking walls or especially the human bodies. If possible please take a look at those Bluetooth audio devices such as headphones speakers or adapters you may find out that most of the product ratings are not as good as any other electronic products.Since you've already returned the adapter to Amazon you may use the refund to try some other brands and find out whether the problem would still exist.RegardsBruce - TROND Customer CareYou're completely missing the point. Your device didn't work past 12' with NO obstructions! I'd say that TROND needs to get customer service personnel that have at least a working knowledge of the products that they're representing. I'm sure that Amazon customers will appreciate reading this thread under the 2 star review heading.robbie
5,I actually use these devices in a bit of a different way than most I suspect.  My wife and I ride a motorcycle here in Utah.  We fallen in love with a listening to my S7's various content while we ride.  But of course we can't both listen to the same audio stream.  For some strange reason the smartphones we carry around with us still only connect to a single audio output at a time.  There's another issue.  I don't like to plug things into the bike when I ride.  I like to just get on and get going.. cables are a pain when you ride.  SO -  with the S7 and 2 of the Trond wireless bluetooth devices I can have the best of both worlds.  1 Trond is the Receiver -  it's paired with my Phone.  The other trond is the transmitter and they are connected together using the short 3.5 mm cable.  This effectively makes the two trond devices a wireless repeater  (other than I do have them wired to get power from the bike)  BUT that wiring is nothing I have to actually mess with.  It's basically static.  I walk up put my S7 into it's handlebar holder (with wireless power) and push the power button on the 2 trond devices.  the lock on before I can back out of the garage and they are loud enough to power our bluetooth headphones even over road noise.  So far I am pleased with the product.  Granted I've only had a few days and can't attest to how they'll hold up.  If that proves to be an issue I'll up date the review.  As an added bonus they keep the audio completely in sync.  I had read up on the Bluetooth options and it seemed like many had lag times that would cause problems when pairing more than a single set of headphones.  Your mileage may vary but for me so far they are working great!.
5,The product works perfectly but Buetooth itself is a complicated somewhat unreliable technology like racing blind into a busy intersection with your eyes closed.  For my setup I wanted something I thought should be simple:  an AppleTV 4 playing music through my Samsung TV and Onkyo receiver with music coming out both the wired speakers in the playroom and a pair of Bose Soundlink Minis on the patio outside (wirelessly via BlueTooth).For reasons too annoying to go into my original plan just wouldn't work.  AppleTV would output audio via HDMI or Bluetooth but not both at the same time.  My Samsung TV could take the audio in via HDMI and then output it via Bluetooth but hijacked the audio from the HDMI in the process leaving my 7.1 wired speakers completely silent.I came up with several potential alternatives involving an HDMI splitter and more cables but I wasn't certain this would work either.  Then I came across this product which cost less than all the additional cables and the splitter would.  So I gave it a try.I'm glad that I did.  AppleTV still outputs audio via HDMI to the TV and stereo and the TROND BT Transceiver broadcasts the same audio wirelessly via Bluetooth out the TV's headphone jack -- the classic "analog hole" solution!  The combination works perfectly.  Sure there's a slight lag between the wired and wireless speakers but you can't really hear the wired ones when in range to hear the wireless and vice versa.  Plus in a noisy party situation the effect was too slight to notice anyway.My one regret is that I had to actually read the directions.  The setup process for pairing two Bluetooth speakers even when two fo the exact same model is not intuitive...  but it works.  Should of including a display on this transceiver (and consequently boosting its price) I can't see any way around this.Give it a chance and read the directions.  It works.
4,ok
5,My family needed a product to connect 2 bluetooth headphones with my iPad and phone so my daughter and son could watch the same programs during travel without any lags. Product  arrived on time with a good packaging and tried connecting both bluetooth headphones without any problem.User guide is very clear With step by step instructions and the product is very user friendly. I had face a minor problem next day and that was easily fixed by involving the product support team and thanks to them for a quick turnaround. The product was not turning on and didn’t turn off and would not pair to the devices so I reached the technical support and received an response immediately with the serious instructions to isolate the issue and to fix it as it is very clear so that a lay man can easily understand the steps to perform. After that minor glitch I didn’t faced any issues till now as it work great. I really enjoyed this product as they advertised and I won’t hesitate to recommend to my friends and relatives as well as I think it is very reliable product. Thanks to Trond.
2,I needed a Bluetooth transmitter for my TV since I have roommates and we are on different schedules. I picked this up because it had a lot of reviews was cheap and relatively small. First off this device has considerable audio lag especially when compared to other Bluetooth transmitters in it's class. It does support aptx LL but beware... Very few headphones support aptx LL. For some reason the device repeatedly lost connectivity with my headphones. I paired 3 different headphones and had the same issues with all 3. I used this transmitter for about 3 weeks and had connectivity issues at least every other day. There were a few times that it stopped charging and I had to do a full factory reset to get it to start charging again. On top of all the connectivity issues and audio lag it also has a noise gate that mutes the audio at low volumes. This audio gate is the biggest downfall of the device as it completely mutes low sounds or music and ruins the emersion while viewing content. Definitely unusable for gamers as footsteps or distant sounds are muted completely. The only way I could see this device being useful is for someone who listens to loud music primarily and has no other options. I'm only giving two stars because it does connect two devices simultaneously when it is actually working. Avantree has way better alternatives that are more reliable and have better performance without a noise gate. The price is higher but definitely worth picking up an Avantree device over something like this.
5,i bought a 4 channel mixer because it was easier than hacking respectable voice control into my computer for running youtube music so i spliced bluetooth audio in from an android phone via bluetooth to this device and then to the mixer.anyway my carbon footprint is terrible but now i can listen to tswift while i play COD and move from album to album with great conviuction & jurisprudence as is warranted and without TROND tyhat would have been slightly more difficult
2,--------- Original Review ---------Getting this transmitter to reconnect to headphones with which it was paired is painful.  It's a trial-and-error effort that's often futile.When it does connect the sound quality is just ok.  The speed of transmission is acceptable. (It's connected to our TV and I don't notice any delay between the people's lips and the sound in my ears.)  However the transmitter stops transmitting sounds when they get so low (in volume).  It seems like an optimization feature to me but it gets really annoying during dialogs: as people pause between their sentences the sound cuts off then picks up again (when the talking resumes) but part of the first syllable is cut off.  It just gets annoying after a while.This maybe acceptable for some people but to me it makes the device useless.  It's so distracting I can't focus on the movie or tv program.--------- Edit: Feb 4 2021 ---------After posting this review the seller contacted me.  They were very kind and offered to refund or replace my device.  After some back and forth here's the bottom line.CONNECTION PROBLEMAfter re-reading the manual more carefully I found out the transmitter needs to turn off between use.  Re-pairing works better when the device was recently turned on.  Sometimes it works perfectly (connecting within seconds) other times I have to turn off and back on again.SOUND/VOLUME PROBLEMThe Customer Care representative explained to me that most transmitters have this issue.  This issue is most noticeable when watching tv shows.  The *cutoffs* aren't as obvious/distracting when listening to music and quality gets better as you raise the volume.  (I prefer low volumes though; I learned my lessons with respect with loud sounds a long time ago!)
5,Connecting to a $500 amplifier and $800 floor standing speakers I’m very impressed with the sound quality and get only slightly inferior quality to my laptops headphone output.
5,I got this product since I could not longer use the 3.5mm headphones jack to get audio from my phone after having to replace my old one. Unfortunately most high end phones these days feel the need to leave off basic features like headphone jacks causing a lot of need for additional accessories that in many cases have not matured to the point of reliability. Plus not being able to charge a phone and be able to use headphones that also don't need to be charged as well..Enough for the getting off my lawn speech.I have a 3.5mm headphone jack and accessory power jack beside each other in my car's center console. I was easy able to plug in and keep it plugged into the USB charger I have in th console with the included USB cable and plug in the included 3.5mm cable to my car.After getting it connected which on no fault of the product as I had my car audio on the wrong input I got sound after being synced. Most the time I simply hold the button on the device until I hear the tone on my car speakers and let go. As long as Bluetooth is on my phone at the time it connects almost instantly.It's a great solution for people that don't have car Bluetooth as long as they have a 3.5mm audio jack in their vehicle.I can't really comment on battery life as I leave it plugged into the USB charger. Some may want to unplug it to avoid possible battery drain but it does go to sleep after a time of no use.
4,UPDATE:  Trond Customer Service reached out to me after my review and I have found that if the device is fully charged the volume is much better.  I don't have to turn the volume up as far and the sound quality matches that of my regular computer speakers.I don't have Bluetooth on my PC so I was excited to read the reviews that this would pair my AirPods with my PC.  That is completely true and it was quick and easy to do.  However I have to turn the volume all the way up to 100 to even be able to hear it clearly and the sound quality is TERRIBLE!!!!  I am keeping it and will use it when necessary because it's better than being tethered to my computer by a cord but I've EXTREMELY disappointed that the sound is so poor.
5,This is my fourth set of Bluetooth audio RX/TX devices and the TROND devices--so far--work much better than any of the others that I have used. The sound is better and even more important they do not need to be re-paired if I walk out of range with the receiver or it turns off. It immediately connects when back in range. I use these devices with a neck loop to play television sound through my hearing aids. The low latency is a great advantage because I can use the system to watch television when other people are in the room without hearing an annoying echo effect.I have this device paired to the TROND 3.5mm Bluetooth V4.2 Audio Receiver Adapter with AptX Low Latency & Volume Control (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M9I0LSK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). That device is connected to a Clear Sounds CLA7-V2 Amplified Power Neckloop (https://www.amazon.com/CLA7-V2-Amplified-Neckloop-Accessory-Cordless/dp/B001OAG2AW/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1504325486&sr=1-3&keywords=T-Loop+neck+loop) with the included male-male adapter to provide clear sound to my digital hearing aids through the telecoil. However it could be connected to any device with a 3.5mm mini stereo audio plug. The whole arrangement is very small and light with excellent sound. The level can be adjusted on the TROND Audio Receiver the CLA7-V2 or the television.The TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter Receiver is connected to a 65" Atyme LED television at the SPDIF audio out (in this case volime is controlled by the Receiver or connected device orrespective of the television sound; even mute) using a 75ohm coaxial cable with RCA plugs connected to an Easyday Digital to Analog Audio Converter with Digital Optical Toslink and S/pdif Coaxial Inputs and Analog RCA and AUX 3.5mm (Headphone) Outputs (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NJCCAKY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to downconvert the digital audio to analog audio and then connected to the TRON Transmitter/Receiver using the included 3.5mm male-to-male cord. This is always plugged into a USB charger and so is always available. The whole arrnagement is behind the television set and not visible.
5,I have had two of these and find them very easy to connect via Bluetooth and three cables. In my case i use it to connect my cell phone and laptop to an older sound system - an 2.1 amplified Alteck Landsing unit that sounds great.  There is an integral battery that last for several hours or you can leave it plugged to a old USB power supply if you use it constantly.That  internal battery does ppmakes it hard to do a hard reset fortunately the need to do a hard reset is very rare.
4,I wanted to connect a small bedside speaker connected to the bedroom TV and decided to go BT rather than hardwire.  My concern however was lip sync delay due to transmission delay.  Reading product descriptions and reviews brought me to the aptX Low Latency by Trond which I intended to use as BT- transmitter mode.  Even before the product arrived I received a welcome email with supplemental installation instructions and a strong message to contact technical support if pairing wasn't working.  Product arrived and setup and pairing was challenging but not difficult if you heed the initial email.  The unit is tiny and easily hides behind flatscreen TV with no apparent signal loss at 14ft.  The big test was lip sync with TV and the product performs as promised with no delay noticed.  One week later I unintentionally did something to break the BT pairing and could not figure out from directions or problem solving how to reset and start over.  I emailed Technical Support and they immediately walked me through a reset procedure and everything was fine and continues to be so.  Good product awesome technical support but 4 of 5 stars because written instructions need to be better written and more comprehensive.  Setup and problem solving would be easier without having to pull in tech support. I would buy this again and still may for another application I'm planning.
5,I bought this little device because my mother’s plasma didn’t have Bluetooth capabilities and she got some really nice headphones she wanted to use to listen to her shows via Chromecast and this device did the trick. It was easy to pair up and works well. She hasn’t had any lag or drops and is pleased with the quality.
2,UPDATE 07/2017 - I've had both of these lock up on me. They will not respond to any type of button presses. The only recourse I have is to wait for the battery to die and start from scratch. I've emailed the manufacturer (who has no website other than Amazon) and will update review when I hear from them.I wish there was a way to leave this more than 5 stars.For a year I've been "hacking" my way through getting music to multiple rooms from an Android device I keep in the kitchen. I purchased two separate BT transmitters and put them on a Y-Cable but there was a problem with them being out of sync. I dealt with it. Moving from one room to another felt as if you were going through a time shift. Then I found another dual BT Tx and tried that one. I could NEVER get it to pair with more than one of my speakers.Then... I found the Trond. I decided it was worth one more try and... it was worth it.I followed the instructions and paired the first speaker an iHome BT. Within 20 seconds it was paired and working. Then it was time for the JBL. The JBL speaker has caused two other brands of transmitters to freeze solid while trying to pair. I followed the instructions turned on the JBL and then the Trond. No pair. I feared the worst. So I tried it once more and bingo! Success. I powered on both speakers then the Trond. Music to my ears! Both speakers were playing music and they were in perfect sync.Even though all of these will be always on I decided to see how reconnecting after power down would go. Everything Off -> Speakers On ->Trond On -> 12 seconds and it reconnected to both speakers!Now I have it hooked to our Echo Dot and we can hear it in two rooms.I used a Y cable to feed the Trond and a local powered speaker. To NO fault of the Trond there is a slight delay (which is expected) going to the BT speakers of what must be milliseconds. Again this is a limitation of a local signal vs. transmitting a signal. I'm ordering another Trond to put on the Y-Cable to feed two more speakers and will update my status when I get it. I'm expecting there MIGHT be a small sync issue between the Txs but since the other speakers will be far enough away it should have minimal impact.Here's my current setup: 2amp Micro USB charger to twin micro USB splitters to power the Dotthe Trond and the iHome which sits nicely under the Dot. I'll add some pics after I get the arrangement nice and neat.
5,update - I have now updated my review to 5 star because of excellent customer service. when I have connected with the customer service and explained the issue they immediately do some trouble shooting and came in to conclusion that the piece I have received may be damaged in shipping so they have sent a new replacement unit which fine with two Bluetooths earphones at the same time (which was my issue in he first place). As it was resolved promptly I have updated the review now.I have this for last 15 days where I am trying to connect multiple bluetooth earphones at the same time. The connection is not stable. I found one of the bluetooth earphone is getting frequently disconnected (it could any one of the two) . Not sure whether my product has an issue .  If I connect single earphone the connection is very stable. Otherwise sound quality is good and there is not much latency as well.
5,Had this for about two years now and really like it- have connected it to 3 different headsets. Also I’ve been able to connect to Apple AirPods Generation 2. Just set the unit to TX mode and hold the power button to get it into pairing mode (red and blue blinking) then set the AirPods to pairing mode by opening the case and holding the button on the back until the light starts pulsing white on the front (note- keep the AirPods in the case during this step) then within a few seconds they should pair and the Trond will be solid blue and the AirPods will stop pulsing finally you can take the AirPods out and they should be working.  After setting them up this first time you can just put your AirPods in and then turn on the Trond (in that order) and they should pair if nearby. I’ve also found that the Trond sometimes pairs better when connected to the audio unit your are broadcasting from.
5,I've only had this device for a few days but it works perfectly and it's versatile. I use it to pair with a Bluetooth Headphone set but I was also able to use the same device to link up (called pairing) with my cell phone. Of course you don't want to use a headphone when driving but it's perfect when you're in a crowded area of at a party or just want the privacy. Having a Headphone for my TV was a great idea that my son suggested. Since I have a mild hearing deficit I tend to turn the volume up on my TV. Of course I use closed caption but even so at night my son complained about the TV. If I was married I'd bet this would have saved my marriage). He's an early riser and I go to sleep late so the combination didn't work well. Since I got the headphone & transmitter he asked me if I was just reading or had turned the TV off. I showed him the headphones and he was very pleased. I tried another Bluetooth transmitter and couldn't get the devices to pair (link up with each other). The Trond transmitter was a snap especially since the representative from Trond responded to my email asking if the two devices would link up before I ordered the transmitter. The next day I got a personalized email from the representative with very simple instructions tailored for exactly my headphones and his Trond transmitter. I think I would have had a much harder time connecting the devices up without his assistance. It's nice to know that some companies still provide personalized service even for a relatively inexpensive device. I give both the device and the representative 5 stars for quality and courtesy.
5,It works perfectly for my use case. I bought this to connect a 30 year old Sony MDR-V6 headphones to my Apple TV 4K. I have the TROND set up on RX mode and connected to the head phones. Once paired just turn the TROND device on and the Apple TV will connect automatically. I’ve tried to use it up to 27 feet with a couple of walls in between and it still receives audio perfectly.
5,I got this for a buddy I paraglide with who uses cochlear implants he had a difficult time hearing us on the radio with all the wind noise. With this connected to his cochlear sound processor and a mic/speaker splitter for the radio he uses he is now able to hear us on the radio without all the wind noise and he is very happy about it!Also it is awesome that even though it’s so small it still comes with a battery 👍
5,Range is phenomenal. At least 150 feet through multiple interior walls in an industrial work environment. Very light compact design.  No latency and near instant connection.  Strong volume and sound quality.  Haven't fully tested battery life yet but I get through a full work day.  Definitely buying a second one for home.
5,This device works really well for my intended application.  My wife and I are ballroom dancers and we often practice with other dancers on the same floor who are also practicing.  I use two Bluetooth headphones and connect the Trond to my iphone on which I have our music stored. This way we can practice whatever dance we wish and always have our favorite music.  Like a number of other reviewers I did have issues in getting both headphones to link with the Trond.  However in my case the issue was my not completely understanding or following the directions carefully.  Here is the procedure that works for me for linking two headphones (A & B).  > Turn on Headphone A and wait 10-15 secs (this is important). > Next turn on the Trond and wait until the Trond button glows a steady blue (they are linked). > Next turn off the Trond > Then turn off headphone A.  > Now turn on headphone B and wait 10-15 seconds > Next turn on the Trond and wait until the Trond button glows a steady blue > Turn off the Trond but leave headphone B turned on > Now turn on headphone A > Wait 10-15 secs. > Turn on the Trond > Both headphones should be linked when the Trond button glows a steady blue.  Notes:  > Waiting the 10-15 seconds is important.  Think of this as letting the little computers boot up. > Also if you turn off the Trond you will have to go through the linking procedure again.  Some folks find this annoying.  But for the price it doesn't bother me at all.
4,Bought it for the Nintendo Switch and I like the size. No lag and the sound quality is good comparable to the PS4 controller aux or private listening on the Roku remote iOS or Android app (not the physical remotes with an aux those have a poor/varying quality and I'd recccomend this TROND solution if you struggle with that.)If you switch between devices a lot you might need to disable bluetooth on those other devices and/or "forget" your headphones the lack of a UI on both can make it hard for them to find each other not unlike like two ships on the dark...I unexpectedly found the receiver mode to be really useful as well! I can't be trusted not to lose bluetooth earbuds so these keep my phone chord free when I'm on long walks with bags of groceries.
5,So I have tried endlessly to pair my Jabra 65t headphones and it just won't work no matter what I do. My wife has some jlabs that I got her at Costco and those pair up just fine but I can't adjust the volume so they stay at a medium low setting but for night time use she is just accepting the issue. Then comes a new set of truly wireless headphones I just got here on Amazon and those connect just fine but again the volume buttons don't work on the headphones and they are automatically at Max volume and can't be used. This is past the 30 day return policy so unfortunately I have to keep it and just deal with the poor audio issues. I'll be doing more research on another one and end up gifting this to someone  who I don't really like ha. I'll give it 2 stars because they actually connect to 2/3 sets of headphones but that's it.Update 12/11/19Customer service is awesome and sent another module and everything is working great. We went back and forth with emails and trying to problem solve and communication was great. Wish all customer service was like this!
3,I specifically got two of these to be able to listen to my TV's at a higher volume while my girlfriend listened without headphones at a lower volume.  Both of my TV's have secondary audio systems attached:  My Vizio has a stereo receiver and speakers attached and my Samsung has a sound bar.  Nowhere was it mentioned that you cannot hook these devices up to a stereo or soundbar.  I finally figured out how to hook it up to my Vizio and paired it to my headphones.  I had to crank the TV volume up to get any volume at all out of the headphones.  Even though my headphone are the over the ear type I could still hear the external TV sound.  There was a noticeable delay between the TV sound and the headphones even though both are the aptX 4.1 Bluetooth.  With the TV blaring in the background I got a mishmash of sound that was way to loud for my girlfriend to listen to plus it was coming from the TV speakers not the stereo speakers so it was loud and tinny sounding.  I did figure out that I could mute the TV and only hear the sound through the headphones but I could not adjust the sound.  And again now my girlfriend couldn't hear anything!I emailed customer service on Friday night and was surprised to get a reply at 3:30 a.m.  Unfortunately they really didn't have an answer for me regarding setting this up on TV's with stereos/soundbars attached.  I'm very frustrated because I bought headphones and two of these transmitters to solve a specific issue and they do not fit the bill plus they have latency that they specifically said they would not have.
4,I have had a succession of issues trying to reliably get this device to pair with various of my Bluetooth devices. My stereo receiver every time no problem. My Bose SoundLink speaker used to connect fine but only if I let the stereo pair first. My Alpatronix speaker forget about it connected one time I think and then never again. I don't know what the deal is.There is noticeable latency if I would walk into where the stereo is with a speaker in my hand you could hear they were just barely out of sync.--EDITI am going to update my previous review after communicating with TROND customer service. I reset the Bluetooth pairing in my Bose. Then I let my Pyle pair then turn on the Bose and it finally paired. Has been fine ever since. Thank you!
5,I bought this about two years ago. It's an older version that uses Bluetooth V4.1. I wanted to use bluetooth headphones with my Nintendo Switch. I tried it out and was disappointed with the delay which was very noticeable. I gave up on it and tossed it in a drawer somewhere.Today I decided to revisit the issue and I saw that these are advertised as low latency so I decided to give it another shot with my brand new Google Pixel Buds (the new ones from this year). I was again disappointed to find that there was still the same delay. It says that you have to have the aptX codec to get low latency. Surely my brand new $189 Pixel Buds would have that feature right? Nope. They don't have the aptX codec because they don't use Qualcomm hardware.So I tried it again with my AirPods and voila! There's still the slightest delay but definitely usable.So if you're experiencing a delay make sure you check whether or not your headphones support the aptX codec!
3,Pros:- Using with aptx headset (LG Tone Infinim to be precise) there is little to no perceivable latency- Small light simple and easy to pairCons:- A lot of interference buzzing and humming can be heard whenever unit is chargingI purchased this to use with my Nintendo Switch since the console does not have built-in bluetooth audio capabilities.  I keep my Switch in an arm mount at work and didnt want to be tethered to it by wired headphones.  My main concern was whether or not there would be latency - and there is none that I am noticing (and I'm usually pretty sensitive to audio/video sync issues) so I am very happy in this regard.However I planned on leaving this device plugged into an AC micro usb power adapter so that I never had to worry about charging it.  When I first connected my headset to the device I immediately started hearing a lot of humming and buzzing sounds.  At first I thought it was an issue with my Switch or the 3.5mm cable I'm using but after trying on a few devices with a different cable I realized that wasn't it.  As soon as I unplugged the transmitter from the charger the noise stopped.  I have tried numerous charging sources (charging from the Switch's dock charging from a micro usb wall adapter that came with an Android phone and charging off of my Anker Powercore+ external battery) and all of them cause this feedback (though the Anker seemed to cause slightly less than the other two options).  It is my determination that there is not enough electromagnetic shielding in the device to prevent interference from the power circuitry.
5,(Momma G's Husband) Bought this to work with my wife's SleepPhones (by Acoustic Sheep - will review those after she's had a chance to use them) to transmit the TV signal via Bluetooth so she could listen at desired volume while I sleep.  The instructions are printed in VERY tiny text on a small piece of heavy paper - get out your bifocals or a magnifying glass.  Apart from that (and a little impatience when I was pairing them - takes more like 5-6 seconds not 2-3) this works great.  No noticeable lag in audio crisp clean sound quality.  I also put this in receive mode paired it with my Kindle and also my cell phone.  Powered via USB and transmits while plugged in.  What's not to like?Anyhow the packaging was small but adequate everything was nicely protected and undamaged on delivery.  Just prior to delivery I also received an Email from TROND with easier to read (larger) written instructions (no pictures/drawings) and a kind offer to provide technical assistance via email.  I sent them one while I was being impatient - I'll let you know how promptly they respond.[Update]  I woke up this AM (having sent TROND's technical support an email late last evening after most companies would be closed) to find that they had reviewed my emails and responded politely and professionally at 3am this morning.  That's Dedication!  As result (and because their pairing instructions were included in the email welcome I received before getting the product) I've upgraded my review to 5 stars.  Definitely worth it.
4,It decreases the volume to your headphone a bit but fixable by turning off your headphone safety feature which obviously isn’t recommended. this item is definitely a life saver  for connecting 2 wireless items to your phone. I use my AirPods Pro and my woojer strap to jam out to music using it.
2,Bought this almost a year ago and initially rated it 5 stars with a rave review. It still works flawlessly in terms of connecting quickly low latency no mysterious communication problems.  I have shown remarkable restraint in not smashing this thing with a hammer.  It works perfectly. It sends me into a fit of rage every time I use it.95% of the time I used this in Rx mode - first as a way to get bluetooth input for my car and for the last 6 months providing bluetooth to my home "theater" a/v receiver w/speakers setup. Here is a typical listening experience:Me [internal monologue]: This is nice I sure love this music or podcast or book especially at the present volume level of about 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. It makes this long drive very relaxi-Trond [through car speakers volume 11]: BLOOOOOOOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Me [audible]: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! I thought I turned off notifications on my ph-Trond: BOOBEEEEP!!!!!!!!Me: I don't know why it decided to make the "device detected........... device connected" sounds again. It was already connected and the audio was perfect. It didn't skip once. Oh well as long as it doesn't keep doing that it's no big de-Trond [through car speakers volume 11]:  BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Me: AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!And so forth.This behavior can happen 2-3 times a minute or once in 3 hours. It's like if it detects the signal strength falls below a certain level it beeps like a smoke alarm to warn you that the audio is in danger of slightly skipping.  It always stays connected it always sounds fine but it wants to yell at you that something annoying almost happened but didn't.Another lovely feature it has was clearly inspired by Homer Simpson's "Everything is OK" alarm.  If you were using it in Rx mode and then turn off the audio source or leave the room with it it beeps once every 10 seconds until you connect the device again.  Why Trond why?I don't know if this is the intended behavior of the device but it is incredibly aggravating.  The rage slowly builds until you can't take it anymore and show that inanimate object who's boss by posting an unhinged rant review on Amazon then plug the 3.5mm audio cable directly into your phone like a philistine.At most I will use it exclusively as a Tx device. If it abuses me one more time it's outta here.  For good!
5,I guess my favorite feature is that I can charge it and use it at the same time. Though once it's charged I can use it to listen for hours and hours through my favorite bluetooth headphones. I got this because my job won't allow me to use regular bluetooth headphones with my computer (because they generally require you to install the software to link to the little usb plug-in and we're not allowed to install anything). With this device I can use my audio jack and still listen to what I need on my computer without being attached by a cord.Pairing is simple but even though the instructions say the device should automatically connect with your headphones or whatever after the first pairing mine do not. I can turn the transmitter on but as soon as I turn my headphones on immediately afterward the transmitter starts doing the blue/red/blue/red flashing thing (indicating that it's searching for a device regardless of one having already been paired). So I then have to put my headphones immediately back in pairing mode for the two to connect. This is fine for me but I think the instructions said something to the effect of the transmitter automatically being able to recognize the headphones when turned on without going through all that.
2,Didn't work for me for the 2 main reasons that I got it : Pair 2 set of audio Bluetooth (BT) devices and Low Latency for video & audio sync.  With the tech behind BT and the versions out there I can't really say the product was defective or not - just that it didn't work for me.  I was unable to get my two sets of BT speakers to pair together.  Once one was paired the other would not - tried different orders and processes but to no avail.  Was able to pair each set individually (and other BT headphones speakers etc.)  with no problems though.  Although I think it is a little mystifying as to what is it connected to since there is no interface to see the connections - but that is OK really - just a nice thing to be able to app into it and see its connection(s).  Since I was able to get it to work with one set of speakers I tried out the latency with audio....not good. I had an audio splitter at the audio out with the BT dongle and set of ear buds connected.  Through the ear buds audio was spot on with the video but through the dongle to the speakers as an estimate probably 400-600ms off with the video - extremely noticeable and unusable.  Tried a few speakers (AV-Express outdoor speakers JBL pill and Sony headphones.) - Results were slightly different with each but none were close to in-sync.  I'm not going to contact vendors/google for the specs on AptX support mainly because I found other solutions with unnoticeable or no audio sync issues.  A Mac Windows 10 and a couple of iDevices all connected (to the BT devices mentioned above) and sync'd up well with the video so I'm going that route.  Might even setup an aggregate audio output on the Mac to connect multiple sets of BT devices but that was just a bonus item.  All in all if just for audio (and single BT device) worked like a champ but fell short on audio/video sync and the ability to pair the multiple BT speakers I had.  Definitely read the directions.  The vendor also sent out an email a few days after purchase with some succinct tips common issues and the general process for usage - a mini-users guide.  Very useful and a nice touch from the vendor. Also really liked that it could be charged and used without a power hookup also a very useful thing.  I ended up returning it
5,Setting up the TROND BT-DUO was simple and easy. I am using it to add Bluetooth functionality to my work desktop computer so I could connect my Sony MDR-XB950BT Bluetooth headphones. This unit is far superior to the typical cheap Bluetooth dongles. The sound quality is great and there is no noticeable latency. I have the device powered via USB in the back of my desktop so I can not comment on the battery life as mine is always powered. If you use the device life I do (always powered) when you shutdown your computer you should always turn off your headphones then the BT-DUO (hold power button for about three seconds until you see it flash red twice) and then shutdown the computer. After you turn the computer back on you will have to turn the BT-DUO back on (same as turning it off hold for 3 seconds). Also turn your headphones on at the same time and while holding them within a foot of the BT-DUO. Ever since I figured that little tip out the headphones connect on the first try every time.I contacted customer support when I couldn't get the headphones to reconnect after turning the device back on and was being forced to re-pair the headphones each time. They were very helpful in tracking down the solution and willing to help every step of the way. If you have any troubles with your BT-DUO you should definitely contact them instead of assuming the unit is bad and sending it back. I couldn't be happier with mine.
4,The instructions were useless. It does work now that I figured out how to install it. I do have to reset it if I don't use it for a week or so.
4,I'm not usually a review writer but I wanted to share my experience with this device as it might help other musicians.  First off this is an excellent piece of tech - it connects easily and does exactly what it's supposed to do.My intended use was as an in-ear monitor for live music performance.  I currently use a wired setup and had hoped that this transmitter paired to a pair of headphones would allow me to cut the cord.  I tried something similar a few years ago but found that the latency (~250 ms) was way too distracting to use in a live environment.  I've seen lately though that a new technology has appeared on the scene - aptX which is supposed to cut the latency down to ~40 ms.  Having great hope I ordered it and a set of Brainwavz headphones.  Unfortunately the delay is still too great; it's very distracting to hear your own voice or instrument in your ears even just miliseconds behind live.  So bluetooth is just not made for this type of use.  I will use the TROND adaptor elsewhere though where the latency won't be an issue. It seems the only solution for wireless IEMs is professional equipment with a $700 price tag.  <sigh>
5,CONNECTS EASILY & IS STABLE. When watching tv I can't get my bluetooth speakers or headphones to the desired loudness level (bad hearing) but that might hv more to do w/the tv's sound output strength because when connected to a radio or cd player the sound is full & rich over the speakers or bluetooth headphones. Lip movements are a bit out of sync but it doesn't bother me. I bought it for movies & tv shows that aren't cc'd; for my limited use I'm happy w/the purchase. (I believe Trond recommended their headphones - of course - to avoid a lip sync problem.) Recommended.
5,I have a tv mounted over my fireplace. All my Audio and TV gear is on the other side of the room.  I only have power going to my TV.  I use an IOBIT wireless HDMI transmitter for Cable TV signal.  I wanted to have my TV audio coming through the stereo system but didnt want to run audio cables. This is a perfect solution.  Before taking down my TV to install this behind it I just used an iPad for test audio on YouTube.  I bought two units.  Set one to TX and the other to RX. Turned them on and within about 4 sec they paired.Instant setup. Walked around the house w/ the iPad to test distance and got about 25 feet before it started breaking up and that was with the receiver out of sight inside the stereo cabinet.  TV is only about 18 feet away to this is a great setup.I can’t detect any latency at all between the visual on TV and the audio coming through.Was not expecting too much and super pleasantly surprised.
5,I use this to connect my bluetooth headphones to my TV so I can play games after my wife goes to bed. I've had this for several months now and I use it a few times a week. It works very well. It takes about a minute or so to connect to my headphones but the connection is stable throughout use. My headphones don't support aptx or aptx-LL so I can't speak to those qualities of the device.What I really like is that It's low-powered enough to be powered by the USB service port in my TV. Thus I don't have another power cable to add to the monstrous power strip behind my TV. Because it's plugged in all the time I can't speak to the battery life.Also as you can see in some pictures posted in other reviews the transmitter is much smaller than the picture portrays. It's pretty nice.
3,It paired with my SONY head phone but not with Mpow headphone.  I will try more and see if it works.  Worked well on SONY headphone.
4,This product does what it was supposed to do. Initially I had quite a bit of trouble pairing with my phone at first.  It wouldn't let me pair with the device and I actually got a message on the phone telling me that "TROND Bluetooth adapter doesn't accept the connection..." or something along those lines. So I turned off the adapter and deleted the previous memory of the connection on my phone and tried it again.  Once I got it paired with the phone it automatically pairs when I turn on the bluetooth adapter so I'm glad that I don't have to deal with it anymore for now at least.  The sound quality is great.  And battery life is good so far after about a 20 min charge.However because of the hassle of pairing at the beginning that's why I can't give this 5 stars.
3,This device is advertised as aptx LL (low latency). Unfortunately I didn't realize that only the TRANSMIT side is aptx LL until after I ordered it. The receive side still uses a codec with longer latency. The manufacturer claims they are working on a version with receive aptx LL but unfortunately I don't expect a software upgrade - it will probably mean a new purchase.The device itself is pretty nice. Very tiny and feels good. Doesn't feel cheap. It's easy to use.Unfortunately it doesn't fit my application. I purchased two of them with the intention of pairing them to create a wireless link for a portable musical instrument to feed sound to a speaker. I was able to easily pair the two units together and the link works and the sound quality was good. But the latency was just too long for use for live playing. If the receiver was aptx LL it would decrease the latency quite a bit but still maybe not enough for live music applications. The way the units are now there is almost a 1/2 second delay between playing a note and hearing it through the speaker.If you need this device to transmit from your TV to headphones or a speaker that receives aptx LL then I would recommend this device. If you are using it to connect to a speaker that's not Bluetooth so that you can transmit from your phone you're probably OK if you know there will be a slight delay which you shouldn't really notice in that application unless you are watching video on your phone. Just don't expect to buy two like I did and have a cheap wireless music instrument link that's usable.
5,I do have problems pairing every once and a while but it is easy to repair and trouble shot. It comes with instructions on how to reset the device to try and repair however one thing they don't tell you is when switching from transmit to receive you have to sometimes also reset the transmit and receive toggle switch which sets the mode by first setting the device mode in what's desired (tranmit or receive) while it is still on then turn the device off in the mode that you want then turn it back on in that same mode to use that mode if for instance you have the device on as a receiver and you want to transmit with it instead but you turned the divice off in the receive mode and then turned it back on still in recieve mode once the device is on you can not change to the other mode with out first turning it off and back on again.
4,FIRST time I connected this as a transmitter from my stereo receiver to my Bose Sound link headphones it went through 2 devices it had connected to before and then to the TROND. Great!  Then I decided to delete the headphone device list from the headphones (to shorten connection time). BIG mistake! Without a list you need to 'select' the Bose from the TROND device as Bose has a 'selector' function. Well no way to do that...! Tried to recreate my headphone device list the same way again...and then 'forget' one or all other devices... NO dice it couldn't discover/add the TROND!  Go figure! And I didn't see any way to reset the TROND... Powering it down didn't help. Finally used my iphone to select the TROND as a receiver instead and then retried the transmitter process with the stereo and it finally recognized/added it!!  And now it is on the headphone's list too.. Whew!! Not exactly logical but it worked... Also discovered if you connect the TROND (as transmitter) to your stereo receiver phono jack and your stereo receiver bass setting is high lower the stereo receiver volume and increase your headset volume to have a balanced sound with less distortion.. Well unless you prefer to change your receiver setting every time..
5,Easy set up. Takes usb power directly from the TV. Paired with my Galaxy buds pro no problem. Buying more for sure
5,I've had one of these for a year now and it still holds a charge for a long time just like when new.  I use it most every day as a receiver in my car.  I do not consider this to be inexpensive but for me it is a good value for the functionality it provides.  I just got another because it works so well and has so many uses.  I've used the two as a transmitter/receiver pair and I'm pretty sure they are using the adaptx technology or whatever it is because the audio/video sync is pretty good.  The audio quality is good even when routed through high volume/wattage systems.Works good as a receiver or transmitter.  I was surprised at the amount of attention paid to the packaging and accessories for this item.  Everything you need is included.  I moved mine around to a few different devices when I first got it and it works on anything with a mini-stereo input (or output if you're using it as a transmitter).  So far it works great with my iphone and galaxy tab A streaming to it.  I don't think my devices use adaptx technology so I can't comment on how well that av syncing works but I am very happy with the Trond's sound quality.  I have been using this device a lot and it sounds good and goes for quite a while between charges.
5,The TROND bluetooth transmitter/receiver is very impressive and does everything I wished it to.  I have an inexpensive iLive bluetooth speaker I purchased in 2015 and it paired flawlessly with it. It has allowed me to now use my non-bluetooth iPod Classic Generation 5 MP3 player and stream over 2000 songs wirelessly.  One important point is the pairing procedure.  What worked for me was I turned on the bluetooth speaker first followed by the transmitter and then plugged the transmitter into the iPod.  Viola!  Importantly you can also use the TROND as a receiver (RX mode).  I plugged the TROND into the auxillary audio inputs of my classic 1976 Marantz 2252B stereo receiver and paired it to my bluetooth-capable iPod Touch and played all my songs through the superior 5:1 speaker system in my living room.  It rocks and is an improvement over a single standalone bluetooth speaker.  Lastly I used the transmitter connected to my Vizio TV's analog audio output with the adapter cable provided.  It streams TV wirelessly through the front room bluetooth speaker going around corners without any interruption of sound.  In summary you can't go wrong with this product.  I especially appreciated the inclusion of three support cables with the transmitter - they have all been useful.  I expect that I will soon purchase the TROND bluetooth headphones to listen to TV.  TROND seems to have excellent customer support if you do have a pairing problem.
5,At first I had trouble with pairing so I wrote customer service. They were helpful but I still couldn't pair my DUO with my wireless headphones. Then I decided to read the manual for the headphones. Lo and behold I only had to hold down the power button for 7 seconds on my headphone and...voila! Pairing. It always helps to read the manual.I then went on to pair my Toyota Camry's sound system with the Duo. It took a few tries but I finally figured it out. Again I pulled out the car's manual. Bottom line: I can now play my iPod with the DUO and listen with my wireless headphones or in my car.Yes I could just plug in a wired headphone into my iPod but wireless is so much easier. No cord to get in the way. And I have been plugging my iPod into my car's audio program with a cord but now I just turn the ignition key and my iPod is paired with the audio system. Great product.
3,The transmitter was easy to set up but there was too much static.  I tried moving the transmitter including adding a 10' cord to see if it was too close to the TV.  I replaced it with another & the new one works great.
4,Used here with TV headphone jack port 3.5mm and USB charging ports.  Transmitting to Galaxy Buds+ does work well just press the red lit button and it turns blue flashing then blue solid when connected.  Dont forget to turn off after tv turned off or it stays on!
5,Old school pioneer receiver plugged this into the AUX Jack and works sounds great.
5,Bought this to connect my television to headphones via bluetooth. The TROND does a good job.  Can also be used as a bluetooth receiver to connect music from your phone or computer to stand alone shelf speakers as a bluetooth audio input. TROND comes with a 1/8" jack so if you want to connect and transmit from standard 1/4" headphone output jack you'll need to purchase a jack adapter.  Customer service was outstanding.  I had an issue with transmission quality from the device.  The customer support team sent me a replacement transmitter and followed up to make sure I was happy with the replacement.
5,Remember to charge it 1st...than put it on Transmit and..BAM ! Connected right up to my Bluetooth Speaker!!ABSOLUTELY EASY AND WORTH IT !
5,We purchased the Trond BT-DUO so that we could provide my wife with wireless head phones.  My wife sleeps with the head phones on and her portable DVD player playing a movie softly to drowned out ambient noise.  We selected a noise canceling over ear set of wireless head phones to replace wired over ear head phones that she has been using.  The old ear phone set has a somewhat delicate wire that we have replaced once already.  We also replaced the pads on the ear phones once as well.  Picking a new set of ear phones was difficult as none of the earphones available are intended to be used while sleeping.  Set up the Trond BT-DUO with the DVD player and the new noise canceling ear phones and made the wireless connection easily and without problems.  We have added a USB charger to the power strip to take care of keeping the Trond BT-DUO working through the night.  Our only concern is with the earphones and their limited play time before they would need recharging.  My wife is thrilled to get rid of the wire.  I think I'll convert the wired headphones on my computer to wireless headphones.  I have to listen to videos using earphones so that I don't disturb the people watching TV in the same room.
5,This product has 3 main features.  Bluetooth receive and transmit transmit to two receivers and low latency transmission and reception.  I use the transmit and receive feature but I bought it mostly for the low latency transmitter so I could connect it to my TV and not experience severe lip-sync issues.  Unfortunately the speaker I bought to pair with it claimed to be low latency but when I paired the two the delay to the speaker was so much that the sound was out of sync and if I had both the TV sound and speaker sound on it sounded like an echo.TROND's customer service was great at explaining to me the need to have an "aptX Low Latency" codec at both the transmitter and receiver end so there is very little delay in the audio out at the speaker or headphone.  I couldn't find a reasonably priced speaker so I went with headphones that had aptX Low Latency.  With the new headphones the synchronization to the image on the TV (lip-sync) is great and I can't notice any latency.  A lot of products out there claim to be "low latency" but unless both sides have the aptX Low Latency codec where the latency is about 30 milliseconds you are going to notice the delay if you are using it with any kind of video.I was NOT compensated in any way for this review.
3,Purchased this on June 17 2018 alongside a pair of headphones from same company.  Right out of the box I had issues with this transmitter & pairing.  Transmitter first tried to pair with 3 phones our tv a lg soundbar and finally the headphones. Eventually after 30+ minutes I was finally able to get the the transmitter to pair with the bluetooth headphones.The major headaches began a few days later as soon as I went to try and use the Transmitter with the headphones again after the transmitterneeded a recharge. At first the transmitter & headphones wouldn't connect when powered on. I had to repeat the entire process above again only to get them working after the same headaches.The headphones were turned on the next day and this transmitter had automatically paired with the lg soundbar that is already connected to a separate system via an optical cable.I want to use this in conjunction with the headphones to make my PC Bluetooth capable. I in no way want to have my PC randomly start sending sound to a separate entertainment center in a different room.Without luck I have found no way to prevent this from automatically connecting to any other bluetooth device it detects.Update - 8/20/18After following TROND Customer Care's suggestion pairing went well.Moved from 2/5 stars to 3/5 stars.LG soundbar was turned off in the other room. If transmitter doesn't have any future conflicts with the soundbar will definitely give a 4/5 star final rating.
3,This Trond v4.1 Bluetooth transmitter/receive is "okay." Not fabulous not terrible but okay.. My biggest complaint is that I can't get the volume loud enough to be really enjoyable to use at the gym with my Bluetooth earbuds which is the main place I bought this and the Bluetooth earbuds to use. The exercise equipment at the GB3 gym I go to doesn't have Bluetooth capability and I knew that before buying this transmitter/receiver but the treadmills elliptical runners stationary bikes and arm bikes all have a 3.5mm jack to plug in a stereo cable so I'm using the Trond Bluetooth transmitter to plug into the 3.5mm stereo jack to transmit the signal to my Bluetooth earbuds. The problem is even with the earbud volume turned up as high as it will go I can barely hear the audio. The exercise equipment has a volume control but no matter how much I turn the volume up or down on the exercise equipment the volume in the earbuds remains the same. It's frustrating because when I plug the transmitter into a home stereo using the 3.5mm cable when I turn the volume up on the stereo the volume increases in the earbuds too though not as much as it does for the Samsung 360 speaker I also have connected via Bluetooth to the stereo.Here's the bottom line. If I use wired earbuds at the gym when I turn up the volume on the exercise equipment the volume also increases in the wired earbuds. For some reason that doesn't seem to be the case with this Bluetooth transmitter working with the Bluetooth earbuds. it's disappointing.
5,Bought this to use with my Switch when it’s connected to the TV so I don’t use my speakers; I live in a small apartment and didn’t want to bother anyone with angry Skyrim noises heh. All I do is connect it to the Switch’s headphone jack with the double ended 3.5mm piece that’s included put my Switch in the dock and I’m all set!I have noticed ZERO audio lag with my Skullcandy Bluetooth headphones. Everything is on point as if they were wired to the Switch itself. I literally cannot tell the difference. Audio quality is fantastic as well.Minor issue others have mentioned: if an area in a game goes dead silent or the music goes silent the unit cuts out temporarily until sound comes back. Not a big deal; this is a power saving feature to help the battery life. Might be a little irritating in games that have quieter atmosphere like Breath of the Wild.Still giving it a 5 anyway because I absolutely love this thing. Highly recommended!
5,I bought this so that my hubby and I could both connect via bluetooth to the same iPad for watching movies while we're flying......something the iPad will not do natively (allow two headsets to connect).  It was ridiculously easy you just connect this to the headset jack and turn it on then turn on the bluetooth headsets and they connect right away.  Something I think the included manual does not make clear is that when using with an iPad (or other smartphone/tablet) is that you have to turn OFF the phone or tablet's internal bluetooth setting and just let THIS device handle that.  It worked well and we watched two movies with no problems with it's battery.  Just pay attention to the compatibility of the bluetooth headset you want to use older ones may not support the low latency of this adapter so they may still work but you'll notice a bit of (dialog) lag time between a character speaking and when you hear what they're saying.....sort of like watching an old Godzilla flick.  Newer bluetooth headsets should not have this problem.  All in all a very worthwhile purchase for us.
5,I ordered the Trond BT Duo for my 100 year old father who must wear headphones (due to extensive hearing loss) to enjoy his favorite sporting events. Upon arrival I did a quick read of the instructions and had it connected and paired in less than a minute. All accessories were included. To be no larger than a Zippo lighter this unit is truly an amazing piece of technology. My dad is once again a happy camper.......... and when dad's happy......... I'm happy!One year Update:  Dad has a “gal pal” that comes over every week for dinner and a movie and when she told me she had a pair of Bluetooth headphones I told her to bring them with her. I followed the directions I had received with the Trond BT Duo and in less than a minute my dad and his friend were enjoying their programs……. each with their own headphones…….. with the ability to adjust their own volume. This is one of those products that is “top drawer” and delivers on it’s promise! I would buy another one in a heartbeat.
2,This is very comparable to the Taotronics unit. $5 cheaper but has a major flaw: it turns off after a period of inactivity. The taotronics model never had a problem turning off. 3/3 days in a row the unit was turned off after about 8 hours idling connected to a power source. And unlike the taotronics model the pairing mode only blinks a blue light and does not alternate between red and blue. This is just too similar to standby mode to tell the difference. Standby is merely a slower blinking.Overall it works but has some issues:1. Pairing. Both this unit and taotronics have problems pairing in transmitter mode. It takes 15+ minutes of constant attempts to get them to pair. They do not pair in 2-3 seconds as TronD claims or 30 seconds as Tao claims. The way to do it is set both up in pairing mode and after the failed attempts put the tronD or tao back into pairing mode immediately by double clicking the button. It eventually gets it. Sometimes it takes longer.2. Staying on. TronD has a problem staying on even with power supplied.3. Reconnecting: there is always a lag reconnecting to a headphone that is paired if your headphone cuts out. sometimes you have to walk to the unit and press the button on the TronD side sometimes you ahve to turn your headset off and back on again.Pros:1. When everything is paired and working the sound quality is decent and it works as a basic transmitter. I'm not thrilled with the sound quality but it works. Which is great if you watch TV at night and are trying to avoid disturbing others.AS far as being a receiver get something else. It's terribly overpriced for just the receiver function. SmartBean makes a great cheaper alternative and has a very cool feature which automatically switches between two sources back and forth without any user input if two streams are detected. In other words if you connect your smartbean to your TV and your laptop it plays from the TV until your laptop has sound output at which point the smartbean will switch to the laptop and then switch back after the laptop output stops.
3,It's easy to pair with your Bluetooth speaker and sound quality is decent. Ther is a delay of about a second in the audio signal going to the Bluetooth speakers.
5,I had a difficult time finding this fact out consistently through the description Q&A and reviews.  Some people said you "should be able to" and some older reviews flat out said that you couldn't!  The description stated it did.I just built a home theater using two powered bluetooth speakers and a bluetooth LED mini projector.  All in all it came together nicely however the voice delay is incredibly bad and not acceptable for my taste.  My plan B was to use the Aux-out on the projector with an aptX low latency adapter (TX) and Aux-in to the powered speakers with another of the same adapter in RX mode.  I cringed a little to try this since I was defeating the purpose of having these bluetooth devices to begin with.Many aptX low latency adapters DO NOT actually have low latency in the RX mode (i.e. at my speaker adapter).  I chose this product becuase aparantly it did.I am super impressing with the result  Firstly incredibly easy to charge pair to each other and immediately use.  Secondly they're TINY.  Smaller than I thought they would be.  And finally the result WORKED.  The audio-video voice delay is GONE.  Works perfectly!
5,This was easy to set up on my Alexa.
5,As someone that travels and hates cords I wanted a good reliable solution. This came in the form of the TROND 2 in 1.Instructions were easy to follow in how to pair it to my headphones and my phone. I use it as a RX when I am flying my airplane and TX when on an airliner.Battery life for me seems to be well over 8 hours (longest flight I been on with it) Matter of fact my QC30s ran out of power before my transmitter did.I can’t comment on distance it can transmit because I have only used it for 2-3 feet at most. For me works great.As sound quality goes I can’t tell the difference at all when my headphones are connected to my phone or the transmitter. So for me great sound quality.After owning the first for awhile now I did buy a second so I can have one when I fly and when I am on an airliner.Only con I have seen is sometimes it took a few times to connect or had to repair but this didn’t happen enough for me to take a star away. Was Super easy to repair.So if you want a perfect little transmitter for traveling this is a great 2-in-1 transmitter!
5,I have a high-end stereo system purchased in the 1990s that still works great but I recently moved to a smaller apartment and had to get rid of my “huge” Boston Acoustic speakers to save space.  To continue using my stereo (consisting of an amplifier/radio tape player and vinyl record player) I bought a small Bluetooth speaker.  That made it necessary to get a blue tooth adapter and I chose the TROND BT-DUO (Bluetooth transmitter/receiver).  The TROND works beautifully and is easy to use and has made it possible for me to continue enjoying my old stereo.  It also improves my TV audio.  Richer sound even at low volume and I do not sense a delay so the video and audio are in sync.That said I did have some trouble setting up my system so I sent TROND customer care a complicated email asking for help.  A short while later that day I got a clear concise and very thoughtful message from Bruce  (TROND Customer Care).  My problem was solved!  Then a day or two later I got a message from Bruce asking how things were going encouraging me to get in touch if I needed any more assistance.  WOW!!!  These guys are not only expert and professional but apparently they actually care.
5,I bought this because my XBOX did NOT have bluetooth connection and I wanted to use my headphones.This worked perfectly right out the box! I am so happy!
4,Works great but did not work when plugged into a projector.  It did work from DVD that was plugged into projector
3,Can take longer to pair even from the same source. Some pauses in music stream. Ok for the price. Good but not great.
4,Good battery life
2,I use it on my tv head phones when I can get it to connect. If I get more than 10 feet away from device my head phones  lose signal. Batteries 5 or 6 hrs. maybe.
4,This transmitter works as described and the audio quality is good for the value.
5,I kinda can’t believe it took me this long to get this. Literally everything I’ve tried to make wireless has become wireless with this transceiver. I even connected a Trond Duo to a second Trond Duo. Had one transmitting from a portable CD player and the other receiving and putting sound out to a yamaha 12-channel mixer that’s wired to a couple speakers and 15’ subwoofer. It’s freaking awesome. I’m an A/V tech and I bring this transceiver to all my gigs to play music and do sound checks. What I didn’t anticipate is my boss and sales guy renting it out for events. So many people see this thing and can’t believe it’s so easy & cheap. And trust me the range from phone to Trond Duo is fantastic. Outside i walked about 75ft without dropping signal.No complaints really but the battery doesn’t last super long. Nor should it for such a teeny tiny device. Also of note: the connectors that come in the box are great but my 3.5mm cable was a little spotty. I replaced it.
4,Shipment: no issues on time efficient packaging.Product: easy to set up compact feel nice to the touch good battery life.Sound quality rating - as expected: Bluetooth quality does the job.Bluetooth connectivity rating - fairly easy but occasionally I run into issues with pairing.I pair it with Jabra Elite Active 75t in the office.  Works fairly well.  Once a while it fails to connect (not often but happens).  Powering the device back on has worked - it does take a few tries sometimes.  Overall I am pleased.  I use it for privacy and convenience.  TROND BT-Duo provides a simple solution for just that.
5,I was specifically looking for a Bluetooth Transmitter and thought this one looked good. All I can say is that it works like a charm. I didn't expect to use this in RX mode often but I was unaware of all the possibilities it offers. I can basically use any of my earbuds headphones or "dumb" speakers and make them wireless. It's been great! Seeing as I only have one Bluetooth speaker I haven't been getting much use out of the transmitter mode as I thought I would not that it hasn't been working great. I'm thinking about getting another one of these to remedy that though.All in all I think that if you're in the market for a Bluetooth Transmitter/Receiver then look no further. In fact I think if you're even the slightest bit of a tech enthusiast you should have one of these in your home.*EDIT* About a year after I purchased this I had a defect come about where the audio would only play on one side of my earbuds. However I emailed their costumer support and they quickly replied back and got a replacement shipped right away. About a week later it arrived and it's been working great ever since. My 5 star rating stays!
4,The TROND Bluetooth transmitter works as advertized. I use it with Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones. While it does dangle from whatever you plug it into I love that I can listen to music on my Android phone without getting tangled up in headset wires.I actually bought the TROND to watch movies during air travel but due to latency of the Bose headphones there is an annoying delay in audio resulting in it being out so of sync with the visual that I can’t stand to watch movies on the airlines. It is OK during scenes without dialog but terrible when you watch someone speak on-screen. This is a real bummer for me don’t know if other brands of Bluetooth headphones have the same issue.I can say that the Bluetooth connection between TROND and my Bose is strong enough that I can leave my phone playing at my seat back mid-ship and still hear music all the way in the back of the plane!Summary: TROND is great for listening to music but not for watching movies (with Bose).
5,Initially bought this for a long flight. I have nice wireless Bluetooth headphones and wanted to be able to watch a movie on the headrest screen of the plane without crappy wires getting in the way. There was no latency static or any other problems. Battery life was very good. I haven't used both functions yet just the transmitter. Easy to pair if following the directions. Highly recommend if you are looking to add blue tooth capability to a non Bluetooth device. I'm now even using them for my TV!
3,= Update 4/20 =Upgraded to three stars. The seller contacted me and provided a replacement free of charge. Service and communication were top notch.The static definitely improved but there is still a noticeable amount if there is a pause between notes. Lag and sound quality are otherwise not an issue.Seller recommends not using their device with an instrument; the product page talks about latency for instruments and ground loop static. Neither of these are issues here.= Original =The product was easy to setup and came with all the cables that I needed. You will need a usb “wall wart” (120V to USB) in order to power the device. After pairing my headphones in TX mode I noticed some static every few seconds. I adjusted the connections and repaired the headphones. No dice. The instructions implied this was due to a bad power adapter. Mine is from Apple. Well the static is there even when running off battery. My guess is that there is some electronic interference in the circuitry. I would recommend trying another brand.
4,I plugged this into the audio port (red and white plugs) on my Vizio TV due to it not supporting BlueTooth. It has worked flawlessly with my AirPods so far. I haven't managed to find a way to control the audio yet.
2,Very hard to pair. Stable bluetooth connection. Does not autoconnect.
5,This transmitter/receiver works just like it's supposed to in Low Latency mode.  This transmitter has LOTS of output level and does NOT distort the audio when higher levels are input into it.  The LL Mode delivers less than 20ms delays and makes using it with my Morse Code transmitter very accurate.The unit WILL work while on constant charging. There is no audio noise from  having the USB constantly plugged into the device. Others make buzzing or humming noise or cause the digital signal to be very distorted.  So this is a plus.However I have found that if I keep this ON all the time (say like you may with a TV) and you turn on and off your LL mode headphones you will have to turn off the transmitter and then turn it back on for it to re-sync to the headphones in LL mode.  Otherwise it defaults your headphones back into standard bluetooth delay mode (about 1/2 second delay).  So be ready to turn the transmitter off and then back on again before turning on your headphones.  This means you wont be able to bury it behind your stereo or other equipment and just leave it plugged in without being able to get to it.  Otherwise I'm VERY happy with this TX/RX device!
4,I bought this for my husband as a Father's Day present and set it up for him today.  I had a bit of trouble connecting to the right outlets on the back of the TV but this was my trial and error method.  Once the earbuds were connected transmission began.  At least in my TV volume is controlled by TV remote.  I am rather pleased with this product and for the price it works very well.Bluetooth Earbuds Bluetooth 5.0 Headphones Wireless Earbuds 35H Cycle Playtime in-Ear Wireless Headphones Hi-Fi Stereo Sweatproof Earphones Sport Headsets Built-in Mic for Work/Running/Travel/Gym
5,I haven't used it in receive mode but I can say that the transmit node works great!I use it to connect my Nintendo Switch to my Bluetooth headphones and it works great! Some Bluetooth transmitters made for the switch connect via the USB-C port on the bottom which would be convenient because they draw power from the port and you'd never need to charge them but then it would be wobbly when you stand the switch up (I put my Switch on the magazine rack of  the Stair Master at the gym and play while I climb). This device connects to the headphone port at the top of the Switch so that's a non-issue.I love that it comes with a small solid connector for using to connect the devices instead of just a flexible dongle.Re-pairing with the headphones every time you use it is kind of a pain - I have to turn my phone's Bluetooth off so my headphones disconnect from the phone and can connect to the TROND but this is more a failing of the headphones than the TROND. Once the phone's Bluetooth is off the TROND connects to the headphone without any problem.
2,I have 2 computers that are next to each other. on is my personal productivity computer and the second is my work computer provided by my employer. I am already sharing the mouse and keyboard between the two using a software called Synergy. the audio how ever is not shared. in order to do that I invested in a headphone jack splitter. with a Bluetooth headphone you need to constantly disconnect from one computer and connect to the other. with this device I can transmit the signal of both PCs simultaneously to a single pair of Bluetooth headphones. The only complaints I have is that charging the device introduces such a huge noise that renders it useless while being charged. The second issue is there is a huge audio lag! generally speaking about 12 milliseconds is noticeable about 25 millisecond is down right annoying. I measured a 100 millisecond delay with this device. while this is fine for JUST music it is good for nothing else. so I rarely use it now. about everything else is done really well.
5,It works quite well. Pairs with my phone my Bose QC earbuds my S1 Pro speaker and everything else I've tried. The dual connection thing is a little complicated but that's to be expected since it doesn't have a screen. For the price range this thing works and works incredibly. Also the Bluetooth range on it is insane. I've had it at least 80 feet away from the device it's connected to with zero problems.Definitely can recommend!
5,I purchased this to connect iPad music to my Bose QC2 headphones wirelessly.  It has worked well & allows me to connect to my iPad that has no audio jack.
5,My hunt to find an option for late night viewing alongside my sleeping wife that would give me great audio at the higher volumes I prefer while keeping the room silent so she could sleep without hearing the car chases and bullets of some action film is what led me to the TROND 2-in-1 V4.1 Transmitter.  Plugging the unit into any headphone port or other audio-out and pairing it with a solid performing set of Bluetooth headphones makes binge-watching a new favorite streaming option - or just listening to music - a no-brainer no matter the hour.  This unit connects easily with two pairs of headphones or one pair plus a BT speaker.  I haven't had occasion to make use of the Receiver function but I can see where that could definitely come in handy too.  Trond is 100% committed to customer service and the 18-month warranty makes it a good bet.  When after a year-plus of much use I found there was an intermittent glitch with my connection.  I contacted Trond explained the problem and it wasn't long before a new replacement unit was delivered to the house.  Highly recommended product and company!  (And I wasn't compensated for writing/posting this review!)
5,I simply love this product I'm a mature female living in a noisy area and this helps me enjoy some peace and quite while I enjoy my movies and other shows....awesome product...
5,This was perfect for work. I connected this to a clock radio on my desk which then allowed me to listen to the radio for hours in the office via a covert BT earbud - without burning up my phone's data plan. I've been using it every workday for almost 3 months and it has performed without fail. I love it. BUT (here's my PSA)... I couldn't figure out why I was feeling ill every afternoon at work. I tried changing supplements limiting caffeine and changing any other variable in my workspace. My mystery illness was affecting afternoon productivity since I felt sick every day I was in the office. Well it so happens there's a lot of anecdotal reports out there about sensitivity to BT frequency. I guess I am just one of those unlucky people affected by BT for some as yet unknown reason. I am only stating this last part in the event someone has a similar issue and feels they are coming down with the flu every workday like I thought I was.  I would highly recommend the transmitter to the rest of the unaffected world and will be gifting this to someone who can use it.
4,Got a surround sound system recently and needed this to connect to the sub. I ran into some hurdles getting it connected but that was probably because I was hungover when I set it up. The instructions were easy enough even though I know no technical terms. The connectivity seems really great though I think the cheap surround system we got sabotages the transmitter with it's finickiness related to extremely quiet scenes. But that is something we are okay with because we know you get what you pay for. This transmitter will be perfect for when we upgrade to a higher quality sound system.
5,This transmitter works fantastically was easy to connect and allows me to pair my apple AirPods to a "not so smart" television. Great purchase!
4,I have a small  AM/FM/CD player in my living room with decent speakers. We  primarily use it when entertaining as background music. Although I have many dozens of CDs when playing music for 4-6 hours it's easier to stream the music from Spotify Amazon iHeart etc.. However my stereo unit doesn't have bluetooth wifi etc. So by connecting your unit in receiver mode into the "audio in" plug I can send via bluetooth from a pad phone or computer. That also gives me a "remote" to change music from anywhere in the room.Since I also have a TV (with mediocre speakers) on wall opposite the stereo play I may get another unit to service as transmitter so I can get more of a "surround sound" effect for movies big events etc.Only slight negative is the range wasn't adequate to send transmission from my desktop computer  in the next room. That negates the remote control advantage of phone/pad so it's not a big deal.
4,It's a good product and does what it was made for. In the vehicle I Bluetooth it to my phone and connect it to auxiliary on the radio and at home I connect it to headband speakers so when my wife falls asleep I can watch TV.The only problem I have is a personal one- when I shut off my headband at night the TROND has a light that continuously blinks so I have to get out of bed to shut it off or if I fall asleep watching TV the blinking light wakes me up sometime throughout the night.It's a great product!
5,I am new to Bluetooth and admit I was a bit intimidated with the prospect of pairing the Trond with my Letsfit T22s. After charging the Trond until the red light disappeared I held down the button on the Trond for a count of three pulled the T22s out of their case and heard them say 'Connected' before I had them all the way out of their charging box and in my hand. It was that easy. Thanks to all you unnamed engineers and coders and tech-heads I can now enjoy my ancient iShuffle tracks on my hikes through the woods of the Cape without constantly untangling headphone wires from 'wait-a-minute' vines. I am truly impressed and grateful that my music was made available to me through Bluetooth without having to shell out for an MP3/4 player or iTouch. Very cool.
5,I was a little unsure as to how well this device would work. I needed it to receive a Bluetooth signal from my phone and output it to my wireless outdoor stereo. It was a pain before this device because I always had to have my phone plugged into the stereo 3.5mm connector when we wanted music on our patio while entertaining guests. This little device worked perfectly no connection noise no degradation that I could tell. Highly recommend! It will also work in transmit mode (see the pic) if you want to send a Bluetooth signal from your device to something else. You have to switch it to get it to work.
5,Got my first Trond in March 2017 to use with Skullcandy Hesh 2 earphones and the combo works really well. Charge both units for several hours before first use. Pairing can be a little tricky at first but once you get the hang it's not a problem.  Got two more Tronds a few months later. One stays permanently connected to my principal TV always powered up and turned on so I get immediate pairing when the headphones are turned on. The second is connected to the audio system. When listening to music I power down the TV transmitter turn on the audio transmitter and re-pair the phones.  The third Trond lives permanently in the FL condo.  Range is never a problem.  I can even walk out the door a few feet before losing the signal. The combination of phones and transmitter gives amazing freedom of movement. In the study unloading the dishwasher sitting on the porch whatever I can continue to listen while doing something else. The milliseconds lag time in receiving audio is rarely an issue.  Have not used the Trond as a receiver so can't comment on that but as a transmitter it has my unqualified recommendation.
5,This tiny little device is a big help-no more ten foot headphone cord.Comes with different cords to connect to tv and has very little if any delay on sound. I have seen some delayed sound but it has been a very rare occurrence. I was having trouble getting it to connect but it was because I had my iPhone on Bluetooth and it would connect to that and so it couldn’t connect to another Bluetooth device at the same time. Turned off the phone Bluetooth and now it connects immediately.I charge it every night as I do the headphones I have.I had been trying to find an affordable Bluetooth tv but didn’t have any luck but this is a great solution in my situation.
5,It preforms the way it is expected. It may take a second extra to link- but I cannot confirm that because it might be the speaker I’m using.
5,It doesn't stay charged.I'm changing my rating to 5 stars because the seller contact me after my review and sent me out a new device that works excellent.
5,I can hook this up to the headphone jack on my 3DS or AV receiver and get the full benefit of wireless; using the Bluedio R+.It's simple to use. I tested my 3DS and it seems to work better than sending it through the bluetooth transmitter(aptx) than wired which is technically an upmixing process similar to 1080p video upscaled to 4k video for example. The sound codecs work the same way as the resolution on your TV in this case.Keep in mind that you do not need to buy the "customers also bought..." av to 3.5mm female. Not only does it already come with one but I found out pretty quickly that it was useless. I bought an extra cable for $7 but it was useless for both reasons.Lastly I recommend buying a better quality 3 in. 3.5mm male to male for placement reasons; like the one supplied but I have not currently found and purchased one after a quick search. I will have to keep my eye out for that otherwise I'm stuck using the supplied male to male jacks.Other than the headphone cable supplied and my wasting money on useless cables in the process this product deserves a 5/5 for making anything with a headphone jack compatible with my Bluedio R+.
5,This is a great little bluetooth transmitter. I plugged it into the auxiliary output of my TV and connected my headphones to it. My roommate works from home so I can watch TV in the same room without disturbing her. Great sound quality and no delay between sound and picture.
5,I initially ordered this because it’s the first device I’ve found that claims to support Bluetooth 4.1 rather than just 4.0. The picture made it look a bit large almost the size of a pack of cigarettes but I figured that its dual capacity as both transmitter and receiver accounted for that. Imagine my pleasant surprise when I opened the package to discover that it’s actually smaller than a box of matches.I revisited this page in an effort to see whether perhaps the model just had amazingly small hands. Looking at it more closely I’ve concluded that no the model’s hands were probably normal — they were just composited with picture of the device via Photoshop or its like without an effort to make sure the scales matched.In any case I’m very happy with the unit so far. I’ve yet to put it through its paces as a transmitter but pairing it with my iPhone as a receiver was a snap and the sound quality is excellent. (Point of note: it has no on-board volume controls. It has only the one power/pairing button and the TX/RX switch. This is of no concern to me since the iPhone’s own volume controls work normally with it but it might be an issue for others.)
4,This product seems to be made with multiple names and I do not know if the quality is identical. Visually they all look exactly the same.As for actual usage - the Trond transmitter/receiver 2-in-1 unit is awesome. Very small light-weight and with good features. Supports AptX Low Latency Bluetooth 5.0. Very easy to use. If you want to provide Bluetooth connectivity to non-Bluetooth equipment such as headphones amplifiers stereo equipment etc this is the product to get.The unit is made of plastic so I do not know how durable it will be. I've had it for a while but I do not use it on a regular basis.I think the manufacturer could have given a longer battery-life by using a bigger battery - even if it would have made the unit a little heavier/larger but that is just a wish - not a complaint.
5,At the time of writing this I have owned this for a little over one year. It still works well. No issues. I use it as a blue tooth transmitter only so not sure how it is as a receiver. Distance is good. Battery life is very good.
4,Bought 2 of these BT transmitters/receivers and use it for connecting TV to my AirPods pro and other BT 5.0 headphones. It's very easy to connect and good battery life. Range is ok about 20 ft for me and it all depends a lot on angles. Low latency means there is still lag not as much as the older BT though. Tried pairing 2 headphones as the same time it was useless. It connects but only work about a minute and one of the headphone would get disconnected. Overall still a cool gadget.
5,Plug and play. I plugged into the back of my tv placed my head phones with in a foot of the transmitter as instructed and after about a minute everything was ready to go. Been using them ever since with no issues.
5,I've got this hooked up to the tv output so I can use bluetooth headphones late at night without disturbing the neighbors in the building.  It connects right away to whatever blue tooth device I've paired to it.  Sound quality is moderate to good -- but way better than the speakers in my tv
4,Yes the device stopped working but their Customer Service is great! They reached out to me a day after reading my review below. The new replacement is on its way! Why only 4 stars I rarely give out 5. Great Job Sonia! I enjoyed this device but it was purchased in July of 2019. I would have expected the battery would die but the connectivity stopped. This device stayed in my car for playing music. It never was wet or treated badly. Now I need to find another one.
5,I recently purchased this transmitter/receiver Trond BT DUO and the Avantree Audio Pro headphones.  I wanted to pair the Trond transmitter and the Avantree headphones to listen to TV and to listen in Low Latency ( no delay in lip sync and voice).  Both devices advertised this feature.  However when I paired the devices there was a delay which was a big drawback to using Bluetooth to listen to TV until the aptX LL protocol was created.  I did not know if this delay problem was with the Trond transmitter or the Anantree headphones so I sent identical emails to both customer support groups to ask for help.  Within 2 hours I got a response back from the Trond support group.  The email from Trond said that on one other occasion another customer had the same problem with the Avantree Audio Pro headphones and that he solved it by sending that customer a Trond BT DUO S transmitter.  He then sent me that transmitter I paired it with the Avantree headphones and it worked perfectly.  This is the quickest and best customer support I had ever had from any electronic device that I have bought on the internet.
4,I use this device with my Sony WH-CH710N  headset . Mostly movies and Youtube  on my desktop computer. Connects with no problems.
5,I recently purchased the Trond 2 in 1 bluetooth V4.1 transmitter receiver to connect my wireless Sony headphones to my Sony bravia TV. Why Sony can't make this happen between two of their devices is beyond me. After a lot of online research I found the Trond to be the best option at a very affordable price and I purchased one. After receiving it it worked perfectly as advertised with no noticeable lag in sound. After a couple months the unit would not re-charge. I contacted the company on a weekend and received a reply from Bruce that same day. Once I confirmed the Amazon purchase he had a replacement in the mail to me and it was delivered ahead of schedule by four days. The replacement unit works perfectly as did the first unit. I'm impressed with the fast service attention to detail and friendly service from the company and the excellent performance of the unit. I highly recommend this device for anyone that wants to connect anything wireless with no noticeable sound lag. Five stars and I'll be buying another one soon for my other TV. Great product!!!!
5,I have an older TV and wanted to play the sound through a bluetooth speaker. I connected this  device to the audio out on the back of the TV and easily connected to the speaker. The sound from the speaker is superior to that of the television and I don't have any visible wires so everything looks neat. I also have a lap top that lost it's bluetooth connectivity. With this device I am no able to pump my music from my laptop to my PA system again.
5,I purchased this as a stop-gap solution for my Nintendo Switch's lack of Bluetooth audio out (Seriously Nintendo?) It works fantastically and is at a lower price point compared to the Taotronics' 4.1 model despite being the exact same item with a different printed name. I also picked up JDS Lab's "ULTRA SHORT 3.5MM INTERCONNECT CABLE" (currently not for sale on Amazon use Google) to ensure that it sits beautifully flush behind my Switch mounted by black 3M picture hanging strips. No discernible audio lag for me while playing Zelda BotW with AirPods.Edit: Forgot to mention that this device works well with AirPods pairing procedure. Once initially paired the AirPods will automatically defer to the transmitter when you turn on the transmitter even if it's currently connected to your phone. If you need to use your phone simply turn off the transmitter and select the AirPods from your phone and it will switch over. Keep in mind that as long as the transmitter is left on it will always hijack the AirPods from whatever device it's currently connected to.
5,Wanted music in my helmet while I ride my motorcycle. So I paired this with some passive helmet speakers and glued a piece of velcro to the transmitter and my helmet. When the transmitter battery dies I just peel it off the helmet charge it and stick it back on. The battery life is what you'd expect from a tiny lightweight thing like this so I just ordered a second one to keep as a charged back up for when the other dies and I'm in the middle of a ride.
4,This TROND 2-in-1 BT TX/RX unit performs extremely well in my TV application.  I'm using it as a transmitter only.  There's NO latency or issues with lip-sync.  I connect this unit to a MPOW BT Headset (red & black) also sold here on Amazon.  Both units meet or exceed my expectation.  The BT TX/RX unit is connected to a VIZIO 32" Smart HD TV through the TV's two RCA audio output jacks (left and right channels).  I turned OFF the TV's internal speakers.  Looks like I found a winner with this configuration.  I've tried some of what Walmart sells and none of their moderately priced BT headsets or BT TX/Headset combinations worked as well as what I've described.  I'd recommend this product to anyone who wishes to do a similar setup.  I haven't tried connecting two (2) BT headsets to the transmitter nor have I used the receiver capability.
4,Used to connect BT earphones to my PC or TV using a headphone jack. (Used with Senso BT w/ mic IPX7)Can be tricky to get paired. I often go through sequences of turn unit on turn headphones on nothing. Turn unit off and on again nothing. Turn headphones off and back on. Cycle unit again... I still haven't found the exact pattern to connect quicker. I always use the unit supplied with power so no feedback on battery power.My phone (Pixel 2) gets distorted and has dropped audio  periodically when in my left pants pocket (Control is on right ear of headphones) but with this transmitting I can walk across my apartment without losing audio. No noticeable latency and volume controls work as expected from my headphones.
5,This transmitter is excellent! It allows two of us to listen to TV with bluetooth headphones at the same time. I've attached a larger adapter since the socket on my Onkyo receiver is larger than the 3.5mm but with that attached it fits and works perfectly. This transmitter remembers my headphones so I don't have to pair them again. It has a long battery life too. We've used it for over six hours and it didn't run out of battery life. This transmitter is small sleek and I'm really happy with it. Thanks for an excellent product!
4,I had a very good experience with the trying to customer service department. At first I couldn’t get the headphones to pair. They sent me instructions on how to clear the memory in my Sennheiser headphones. When I still couldn’t make the headphones and the TV pair they sent me further instructions. What I learned is that it’s very important to know exactly what you need to do and the order in which you need to do it. For one thing you have to keep the transmitter unplugged from the TV before you start the process. Anyway it’s really important to follow the instructions and then they work just fine.
5,I picked this up for ~$23 on a sale and use it only as a transmitter from a small TV to bluetooth headphones while I work out on an elliptical. The product performs as advertised as a transmitter. The sound quality is solid connecting has not been an issue and the size of the product itself (just larger than a postage stamp!) is impressive.Note: the product did not perform as expected out of the box due to user error - I learned the hard way that if you attempt to have the device plugged in at the same time it is transmitting that it generates white noise/feedback that lowers sound quality significantly. Unplug it from power to run on battery and it's as clear as transmitting from my phone or any other bluetooth device.If you have any questions the support team at support@etrond.com were *fantastic* - they responded within 24 hours and let me know how to get the best performance. I'm a very happy customer and will consider TROND for future devices as a result of their helpfulness.
4,I have a turntable that plays through an old receiver in my home office. I use the Trond to send the signal from the turntable’s receiver (via the headphone Jack output) to my Bluetooth enabled stereo receiver in my living room. The Trond transmits really well the signal passes through a wall with no problem.Happy with my purchase
5,The   [aptX Low Latency] TROND® 2 in 1 Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Audio Transmitter and Receiver - Bluetooth Transmitter for TV iPod MP3 CD Player or e-Reader; Bluetooth Receiver for Car or Home Stereo         works exactly as promised and sounds GREAT. It arrived in one day has great range (30-40 feet through walls) is tiny and light and (as I mentioned) sounds great. As a receiver I'm using the BT-Duo with a pair of Etymotic 4 in-ear headphones which are very unforgiving and they sound almost as good as when they're plugged in directly. (AptX connection). As a transmitter I use the BT-Duo with a pair of   Lumsing Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Noise Isolating In-Ear Headphones with Microphone         and it sounds as good (and connects as well) as my Nexus cellphone does. Haven't had it long enough to tell how long the battery lasts.I recommend the TROND BT-Duo whole heartily. It has MUCH MUCH better sound in both directions than the   Brightech - BTX Ultra - 2 in 1 Bluetooth Receiver and Transmitter with aptX Low Latency for Lag Free Transmission between Audio and Video         which I returned because it had low muffled volume in both directions and was a BIG disappointment.
3,I wanted to use this device to transmit our TV audio to our bluetooth sound bar.  There was a slight lag in the audio so that it echoed the TV but the audio did not noticeably lag behind the video so I was able to just turn the TV volume all the way down and completely control the sound with the sound bar.  Also - I am not 100% certain if my sound bar bluetooth receiver supported the AptX Low Latency so it might have been that which caused the lag.Regardless of this the transmitter just didn't work for me because it was too much of a pain to deal with charging the device regularly.  I didn't want to be unplugging it from the TV constantly and there isn't a remote to turn it off when you're not using it to save the charge so I would have to get up and power it down every time I was finished using it.  It would be much more suited to my purposes if it was battery powered.The device was incredibly easy to set up.  I had absolutely no problems getting it to connect and the audio was very clear.  Five stars for the item being exactly as described and high quality.  One star for the hassle to use it.
5,Some of the reviews nearly scared me away from this product. Glad I went with my gut. Here is how I used the product: linking two devices when neither had Bluetooth ability. In this case I am relying on the same processing ability for both the receiver and transmitter. I bought two of these units: one for the earphone jack on a video projector set to transmit; the other was connected to an older Vizio sound bar (11+ years old) in receive mode. I am totally satisfied with the results.
5,I’ve been using this device for a few weeks to connect to my iPhone since they no longer have audio jacks. I researched bluetooth headphones first but I wasn’t impressed with the battery life sound quality and latency mentioned in the reviews plus I already ownes headphones I like. I plug the headphones into the device and then hold the button until it pairs with my phone. The sounds when it connects or warns that the battery is low are very pleasant. I don’t remember the initial pairing process but I followed the instructions that came with and it worked perfectly. As a reciever it seems to be just what I wanted. I also purchased a bluetooth earbud for work and when I switch between them I can really hear this difference in sound quality (the Trond is much better). I have also watched videos with the reciever while my phone was plugged into power and I never noticed any latency (or so little that I have to consentrate to notice it) which I have definitely noticed with other products. I can’t speak to it’s longevity but so far so good.
5,Great little device.  So far I've used it to pair with my Motorola S305 headphones https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BH3I9U/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_118?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A17Y7218I8U3RT.  The only negative so far is that the unit takes a good 30 to 45 seconds to connect to it.  My Airpods also connect and seem to connect a bit more quickly than do the S305s.Sound quality is great from what I've seen so far with multiple sources and types of music.I got the unit to use with my computer when I'm playing guitar with songs so I don't have to deal with headset cords getting in the way.  It has worked flawlessly for this.  I connected it via the RCA connectors to an older LED TV and it worked flawlessly there as well.  There was no latency at all and the audio was in perfect sync with the video.I have not tried the receive function but I'm assuming it will work just as well.I will probably sometime down the road get another to use on the TV in the bedroom so I don't have to keep taking the unit to and from the bedroom.
5,I am hard of hearing living in a house with many people with way more sensitive hearing. Before I used to have to use closed captions when watching TV with others and use no volume with the TV if anyone was asleep. Plug this right into the TV and connect it to my headphones and it solves all the problems! I can get the audio through my headphones and i dont miss a thing (though for this I did have to run a headphone splitter with another aux cord going to our speakers if watching tv with my roommates). Its cheap and really easy to use my headphones connect quickly and easily.
5,Fantastic device  - works with 2 headsets at once. This was bought in order for 2 people to watch TV in a loud environment at the same time with headsets.I bought this transmitter as a present and my colleague had some issues with pairing it at first.He successfully paired 1 speaker but could not pair another headset. We contacted Bruce at Trond and he was extremely helpful detailed and prompt on his replies. After looking into it I realized that he didn't enable the pairing option on the headsets - clearly it wasn't an issue with the Trond at all. Nevertheless Bruce's help was great and the device is exceptional.Proven works with the following 2 devices:TaoTronics Bluetooth Headphones   TaoTronics Bluetooth Headphones Wireless 4.1 Magnetic Earbuds Stereo Earphones Secure Fit for Sports with Built-in Mic [Upgraded Version        ]AcousticSheep SleepPhones Wireless   AcousticSheep SleepPhones Wireless Headphones (Midnight Black One Size Fits Most)        There actually isn't even the need to mention this pairing issue as it was clearly a user error - but I want to point out the great customer service that Trond provided.I would recommend this product.
4,Works very well
3,EDIT: Trond gave me a refund for the product. This transmitter did not work for me but the manufacturer took care of my request for a refund. Great customer service ! Went from 1 to 3 stars because of that.I purchased this to use it with 2 pairs of wireless headphones: Mpow Bluetooth Headphones and Bose QuietComfort 35.First of all I can only connect the Bose then Mpow in that order. If I connect Mpow first the Bose won't connect. It makes no sense.Second If I walk beyond the range of the transmitter the signal won't reconnect when I get close again.I have to turn off both headphones then the Trond device then Turn on the Trond and then reconnect the headphones in the order mentioned above. This is really inconvenient.Third sometimes after losing the signal because I walked a bit too far Trond freezes and I cannot reconnect or reset it. I have to wait for the battery to be drained before I can use it. Ruined evening...Very disappointed in the product. I have not use it much in the first month and did not notice these problems until after 2 months or so from purchasing it. Can't return it anymore. $30 down the drain. I would give it zero stars if I could.
5,...super small easy and works perfectly.  What can I say...attached this to the headphone out jack on my TV in the bedroom and paired it in about 10 seconds with my Harmon Kardon BT speaker across the room.  The directions are decent...basically for me I just held the power button down for 3 seconds to turn it on and it automatically detected that it wasn't paired to anything and then started flashing a fast blue meaning it wasn't paired.  I took it into the bedroom turned on my BT speaker and press/held the BT button to put it into pairing mode and a few seconds later the speaker beeped meaning it was paired up and the TROND transmitter went to a solid blue meaning it was paired.  I plugged it into the TV and voila!  worked like champ.  Can't really get any easier than that...sound is great too  The box comes with a 1/8 to 1/8 if you are connecting from your headphone jack on your TV to the transmitter as well as a RCA to 1/8 female if your TV or device uses RCA cables instead of the 1/8.
5,I'm using the TROND only as a transmitter so can't review the receiver. I found the range to be as promised and the sound quality was good and I didn't notice any latency in dialog (I'm using it on my TV sound output socket. Some rather heavy music (watching "Blacklist") came through with good quality. At first I couldn't get a pairing with my TOZO earbuds so I sent an email to the TROND help link. I got an answer back in an amazingly short time. The rep gave me clear instructions for pairing with the TOZO. The instructions worked find once I remembered that the  TOZO buds had already paired with my iPad! After hiding the iPad the pairing was immediately successful. Good product very good help.
4,I use it to transmit the sound from a Sony LCD TV.  I am using the headphone-audio output on the TV I purchased a USB power adapter for continuous power and am transmitting the sound via the Trond Bluetooth adapter to a Bose Soundlink speaker.  Setting it up was easy but I did experience a problem where the Trond stopped transmitting after unplugging power then plugging in power.  It stopped transmitting bluetooth.  I was able to get the Trond back up and working by setting the switch to the receive mode then pressing and holding the Multi function button then switching back to transmit then resyncing back to the Bose Soundlink.  Unit worked for about a month flawlessly then the glitch happened about a week ago and now is working flawlessly again.  I will say that Tronds customer support is excellent and they will help you out via email if you have a problem.  So far so good!
5,Does the job.
4,I have been wanting a blue tooth transmitter. I was glad to find this.  I use it as a transmitter.  I pair it with a blue tooth speaker and carry my music all over the house.  I have had it a little over a month when it quit pairing to the speaker. I tried charging it and the lights showed it was on. I didn't see a reset button so I contacted customer support.  They told me to turn off the transmitter and turn it on with the receiver on for 3 seconds to erase the memory in the transmitter and then turn it off. It was then recommended to put it back on transmit and try pairing.  It worked.  I am happy with the Trond  2 in 1  3.5 audio Bluetooth v4.1 transmitter and receiver adapter w/ AptX . I appreciate the help from the customer service very much.
5,I was looking for an iPod docking station to replace my failing station.  The options were so few and far between that I knew that there must be a newer tech alternative.It turns out it is bluetooth.This one Trond had a mid range price with a high user rating.I was uncertain how such a gizmo would work.If a few words--it does work.After a  few weeks of use I can report battery life is good; range is good even when transmitting from indoors to outdoors; it plugs into a computer an iPod radios...anything with a headphone jack.
5,My wife and I bought two MPOW(Gen-2 Version) headsets and this "TROND® Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter Receiver Audio Adapter with AptX" for ballroom dance practice. We dance American-style so there is a lot of free-spinning and head-movement.  I delayed this review until we could get several hours of experience with them.  On a 40'x40' practice floor the blue-tooth reception range stays solid across the whole floor with the Trond in one corner (well over 10m) when we leave it sitting stationary.  We get skips (but no loss of beat) when the Trond/player is in my pocket but that seems to be from cable-movement at my player's audio-jack connection.  RePairing this Trond with those two headsets still seems more art than science but my best result seems when we power-up the two MPOW headsets first and then the Trond.  Still I've always managed to get both headsets to pair and then they stay linked and sync'ed.  We have yet to try our setup in an practice-area where there are gobs of blue-tooth devices competing for bandwidth.  I expect some issues and particularly with greater distance and competing devices between the Trond and our headsets.
4,This is easy to use. You can pair an AptX low latency sound bar and a pair of headphones simultaneously. I use both when working in my office. Headphones when people are around sound bar when no one near. It gets about 7 to 8 hours of continuous use on a charge. The only complaint I really have is the charging cable port is finicky so the transmitter will charge for a few minutes then stop. I had to secure the cable to the transmitter to ensure accurate charge cable position in the charging port. This ain’t enough for me to send it back though. I love this product.
4,NOTE: this is an updated review from my first/original posting and is based on the newer TROND BT-DUO S model which is very similar to the model I first reviewed.I purchased this to connect to my Samsung HDTV and watch using my Sony Bluetooth headphones.  I got it to work.  I had it plugged into an AC/USB adapter so that it would stay on 7x24.  My headphones were about 20 feet from the TROND device.  Most of the time my headphones auto paired with the TROND device within 10 to 20 seconds.  Sometimes it would auto pair within a few seconds and sometimes it would not auto pair and I would need to power cycle the TROND device to get it to auto pair again.  Other than that the device worked fine.  I would have given this device a 5 star except that the auto pairing wasn't always 100% consistent.
4,I bought this item to pair with my Bose headphones and Amazon Echo simultaneously. The Echo kept dropping the audio after a minute or so.  Contacted the company and they were extremely helpful in trying to resolve the problem.  They even sent me another model (TROND BT DUO II) for free.  Turns out the problem is an issue with the Amazon Echo.  Amazon customer service could not resolve the Echo issue.  Anyway I just use it with my Bose headphones and love it.  Pairing is very fast and little to no latency.  It works fine with Bose and other Bluetooth devices simultaneously.
4,If you bought this for sound quality it depends. For music I would rate it a three of five but depending on your tastes and experience a four for music quality is possible. No way a five. Now if pod casts or listening to Audible etc. is your thing then 5 stars on clarity. Technically it is a 5 stars as well. This was all from TX on a laptop to earpods.
2,I bought these to see if I could use for an inexpensive in ear monitor for playing music. Unfortunately lag is too bad. I tried using with Apple Airpod Pros. I also connected two Tronds together (one TX and on RX). The lag will just not allow it to be used for live music. Might work good for in car use. I will be returning both these. Did not test for video/audio lag.
4,nice
5,Easy to connect and very clear sound. If you are connecting to a TV use the composite output (RED-WHITE) instead of the 3.5mm
5,Works well with digital audio. Works well through a wall but gets choppy at about 25 feet through 3 walls.
4,I am using two of these modules as receivers. They feed small 20 watt stereo amplifiers on two different floors of the house. I am using 5 volts DC from the amps to power the bluetooth modules so they don't need their own wall transformers.The sound quality of these transceivers is excellent and the reliability and range also is quite good. Setting up the two receivers to pair with a single transmitter is a bit tricky but works well and is a great feature.One issue I have is with the LED status indicator. The manual says "Once paired the indicator will turn solid blue". Question: is the device in my photo paired? The LED is blueish and redish Answer: the device is paired. The lack of a clear indication of the device's status can be frustrating when when trying to set it up.
5,I purchased this item so that my iPhone could airplay music and other content to my Onkyo stereo system.  I was very skeptical at first about using bluetooth rather than wifi to do this but this products works just as described.  The sound quality is excellent there is no lag everything is in sync and the connection never drops between my iPhone and the transmitter/receiver.  The transmitter/receiver does have a battery but I have it plugged in with the attached power cord.  This transmitter/receiver would be great in a vehicle in order to listen to streaming music or if you are like me and you don't have traditional internet.  The seller was even kind enough to send me a quick start guide in my email the day that my new transmitter/receiver was scheduled to arrive.  As a note you should fully charge the transmitter/receiver before you use it for the first time.  This has been a great purchase and I would definitely buy this item again.  The sound quality is better with the transmitter/receiver than it was with my auxiliary cord that I had been using.
5,When you're near it (most of the time) it connects well and transmits fine.  I have it centered in my shop so I can work in my woodshop and use my ISOtunes.  The transmission cuts off about 10-15 feet away from it and doesn't do well in certain spots.  It's a low powered transmitter so that's to be expected but it would be nice if it wouldn't cut out at times 5 feet away.  My neck seems to block it at times!Update:  customer service contacted me and sent a new unit.  The new piece works very well and changed my review stars to 5 based on amazing customer service.
1,Chose this device as the 5 star ratings were high. Now 3 weeks later I filtered to see recent reviews are the most negative. Seems this product has been out long enough that the seller may be "recycling" from the returns bin.This device worked perfectly up to today. Now it gets stuck in pairing mode. It will drop to waiting again while I can see the headset is still attempting to pair. I repeated the process several times then the earbuds just turn off because they detect nothing.I went through the house to make sure everything within 50 feet has no Bluetooth service on. The earbuds were sitting within an inch of the transceiver. Turned everything off restarted the pairing process same thing occured where the transceiver never paired.I would also like to note that the unit was simply hanging behind my television and didn't need to be prompted like the instructions mentioned. I would just turn my headset on and pairing would happen almost instantly. Then today I noticed the red part of the light was flashing oddly. So I unplugged the unit from power. After that it showed waiting mode only. I double clicked it to pair but no luck as I said above.It really sucks that I'm just going to a local walmart instead of supporting a seller. I can buy a six dollar transceiver there and get it replaced the same day if I need to. Hell at the rate of 3 weeks I would still be saving time and money!
2,Even when plugged in when the device is acting as a receiver it will turn itself off if it is not paired. Why is there no condition to check if it's plugged in?
4,The Trond functions perfectly and is easy to use.  The large power/pair button is very ergonomic.  I use it to listen to television (netflix etc) and there is no lag or dropouts when the program sounds is low. It pairs easily and once paired connects to the pair device everytime. after 10 or 15 seconds.  I bought it to replace a similar device from Taotronics which had multiple frustrations.
5,I bought this mainly for the transmitter to two headphones at once function.  Upon receiving it and testing for the first time I paired two headphones to it one at a time.  I started listening to it with the first pair of headphones then when I turned on the second pair of headphones the sound quit.In fact the transmitter was locked up and would not even allow me to power down.  I contacted Trond customer support and they got right back with me the same day.  We tried several experiments but they ended in the same result (a locked up transmitter).  Through the process of elimination we were able to determine that it was my Motorola S9 headphones that were causing the issue.  I was able to successfully pair with 2 bluetooth speakers or a speaker and the other headphones but as soon as I involved the Motorola S9 headphones then is would lockup.  So there is an incompatibility there.Because the product worked with other device and excellent customer service I would still give this one 5 stars.
2,I haven't tried using it as a receiver but as a Bluetooth transmitter this device has a very annoying tendency to cut out low audio. I tried switching Bluetooth headsets plugging the headset in directly etc... but it is absolutely just this device. It is a recent thing I don't know how that's possible but it only started happening 7-ish months after I started using it. The device lives in my home I don't throw it around or abuse it in any way so it can't be damage.It is fine if you're using it for gaming or conference calls but if you're listening to music it is very noticeable there are hard cuts where when the volume is low in a point in the music it creates a hard cut like the transmitter stops sending sound  it's driving me crazy because it sounds like the signal is constantly cutting out. If you are using it as a transmitter and you are listening to music avoid purchasing this. It's fine if you're only using it for gaming or calls though. Connectivity is great and controls are easy to use. It's very unfortunate that this problem popped up.
5,I have used the product for a couple months now. Connecting was super simple. The Bluetooth module is plugged into the back of a projector. Sound signals go from a roku device through the projector to the Bluetooth module transmitted to a sound bar where it is finally played. The lag is nonexistent. Very impressive.
5,I purchased the Trond BT-DUO wireless transmitter & receiver to use with my Sony 4K television and headphones. Although this Sony has Bluetooth it will not recognize any Bluetooth headphones! First I purchased an inexpensive Bluetooth receiver from another source that I attached to my Bose non Bluetooth headphones via the included Jack. I then tried pairing the Bluetooth receiver with the Trond. (First I had to place the Trond on the TX setting.) It took me a few attempts but I was able to successfully pair the devices. However I was unable to get any sound out of the TV using the included red white connector that came with the Trond. I found a solution on the Internet. I plugged the Trond into the headphone jack on my television and also into the USB port on my television using the included wires but not the red white wire.  It worked perfectly. I have a sound bar attached to my television. When I am using the headphones I simply turn off the sound bar and I receive the sound through my television. The sound is excellent used this way.
5,I am going to assume that aptX Low Latency & aptX that's built into this product is why my problem is solved! By following the simple instructions I was able to pair up two Sony SRS-X5 BT speakers that sit in my kitchen and bedroom respectively so that they play with practically zero latency between them even when I turn one off and back on again. There's more of a latency  between them and the stereo receiver that the transmitter is plugged into and the Onkyo stereo receiver's surround sound speakers that also plays the same music in the living room (I have a loft style 926 sq ft condo so I can pretty much hear music output from all rooms). Second I bought a BT transmitter that was half the cost did not have aptX Low Latency & aptX and not only was their latency between all music outputs but the sound was so distorted that it made music an irritation rather than a pleasure. I learned my lesson regarding what to look for in a BT transmitter.
5,I purchased this to allow two Bluetooth headsets to connect to a single audio source - specifically to a Zune MP3 player that my wife has for music and audio books. Pairing was fairly straight forward when following the instructions and quickly connected to both headphones. We tested it listening to an audio book for about an hour. We placed the TROND connected to the Zune on one side of the room and sat on the other side of the room (about 12-15 feet away.) The connection was stable with no disruptions during the hour of listening. The audio quality was good with no noticeable degradation as we moved around the room.I can't speak to the expected battery life as we have not used it beyond the original test period. We are planning a trip to Honduras an another to the UK in the near future so will have a better idea of battery functionality after that.I have also not used the receive function on it so I can't speak to it's usefulness and functionality - that is not what I bought it for.
4,So the device works. However it is not as flawless to hook up. Here is no interface to interact  with so you just have to keep pressing buttons and pressing buttons. It takes a while to pair up but I’m keeping it because when it works it’s great. I try hooking it up to my TV and it worked with airpods Pro but to replicate it it takes a while to fiddle with.
3,I bought two one to transmit sound from older projector the other as a receiver hooked to a Bose Lifestyle system. Paired quickly and overall these tiny units work well but there is a very noticeable lag between image and sound. This will not be a long term solution for me unfortunately.
4,Works very well for being so small.
4,I use these for solving a hearing problem with TV listening.  They work very well as specified but I would prefer if the range were greater at least 12 meters.  I use them with Avantree Bluetooth/Wired Headphones and pairing has been a challenge but I have found a reliable way to pair the devices.Starting with the Trond in the TX mode and turned off with power applied and TV sound on and with the headphones turned off I then follow the procedure as follows:  First turn the Trond ON by holding its button down for five seconds;  then while holding the two devices close together press the headphone MFB or power button down until two separate tones are heard; then release the MFB button.  Hold the two devices together until pairing is achieved indicated by the Trond light flashing red and then is a steady blue.
3,UPDATE 6/15/21: Trond customer support contacted me and provided a working replacement I’m adding a star for the good customer support and for standing behind their product. Time will tell of this unit can last longer than the last.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Product worked great in my car to play music from my phone until it didn’t.Now it works for 1-3 seconds and then drops the Bluetooth connection. Tested with multiple iPhone with same problem it seems to lose power? Either way it’s garbage now and we’ve gotta find a better solution.
3,Had the unit only a few days.  I am not using nor need the battery but it's part of the design.  Was not aware of this prior to purchase.  Q/As talk about this but I wasn't searching for that info (I didn't search for something I hadn't even thought of).My intended use was a permanent connection from upstairs to basement whole-house audio system for automated house announcments.First thing I have found is that if the power goes off the units do not automatically reconnect.  This is a show-stopper in my situation.  I am living with it for now until I find a new soluation.  For now I will have to go to the basement everytime there is a power blip.Second though I have not yet experienced this yet coming back here looking for additional info now I am seeing reports that if the units are plugged in all the time they still may eventually shut off.  I have not yet seen this but this to if true is a problem for my application.
5,I've had this item for a few weeks now and it has been working flawlessly in Transmit mode.  I have not used it yet as a receiver so cannot speak to that.  I use the device plugged into the headphone jack of an older Sony surround-sound system through which I listen to audio from multiple devices.  I connect via bluetooth to Sony XB950BT headphones and have received audio this way from Chromecast videos streamed from my phone and tablet to my TV previously recorded shows and Amazon streaming videos from a TiVo DVR and movies from a Blu-Ray player. Oh and audio from my desktop computer as well.  The transmitter has performed well in all of these cases with no noticeable lag between the video picture playing on my television or computer monitor and the audio coming over my headphones.  This was a concern of mine having so many audio sources running through a sound system that is about 15 years old but the APT-X functionality in this transmitter seems to be working beautifully to avoid lip-sync problems.  Very satisfied.
5,Small easy to handle doesn't take up any space and does the job well. Connectivity is quick and easy.
5,I use these headphones and the BT-DUO transmitter almost daily and had no issues for several months after purchase.  One day the headphones wouldn't pair up with the BT-DUO so I contacted support about how to reset the DUO (I had lost the manuals). I got a very quick email response with the manuals attached and instructions on how to reset the  BT-DUO.  Followed these steps and was back up and running in no time.  No further issues in the last 30 days.  Good product - great support.Please follow the steps below:•  Power it off while it’s in the TX mode;•  Wait for at least 3 seconds switch to the RX mode and then power it on. Up till now all the pairing record saved in the TX mode is now deleted;•  Power it off switch back to TX and start using it as a transmitter.
4,We got the transmitter connected right off the bat to the Bose speaker my wife uses for her ukulele but we couldn't hear anything unless we held it right up to our ear. Used the transmitter on my iPhone and some thing with the Bose speaker. Connected the transmitter to her amp and one of my headsets and worked it great. There is something about the connection with the Bose speaker. We contacted TROND and customer service was great they said they do have some problems with new Bose speakers and sent me an upgraded version to try. A bit louder but still not loud enough for what we want or need from the Bose. So I'm knocking a star off of a 5 star product because of the Bose/Bluetooth issue.
4,I have to hit the button to power on a nd reconnect with my phone when I want to use this. Inconvenient but since vehicledoes not have Bluetooth audio this connects to my Aux port. I leave in my center console.Sound Quality is excellent.Glad that it comes with short cord.
5,I wanted a way to connect two Bluetooth headsets so my wife and I can watch the same movie while flying.  The Trond unit arrived in good shape and connected to both headsets without issue (I did have to turn the Bluetooth setting off on our two iPhones first).  I did have one small issue after one day that was easily remedied thanks to a quick response from Trond technical support.  The unit "froze" in the on position and would not turn off and would not connect to the headsets.  I emailed Trond technical support and received an answer within a couple of hours with instructions to let the Trond unit battery run out and then recharge and all should be good.  The tech described it as similar to a computer crashing.  After the battery ran down and I recharged it everything worked great again!  I didn't even need to re-pair with the two headsets.  I will not hesitate in the future to buy anything Trond makes based on their great technical support!
5,I purchased this with the idea of using it in Receiver Mode with my WIRED earbuds to listen to TV late at night without disturbing my wife.  This unit paired with my TV within ten seconds at most and it's been smooth sailing since.  Volume is not an issue and the sound and video of whatever I'm watching sych up perfectly.  Couldn't be happier!
5,This device is simple to use the sound transmitted to my bluetooth headphones from my TV is good same sound quality as from my cellphone. It was somehow difficult to pair my headphones with it only on the 2nd day both of them recognized and paired. Pairing de cellphone to the device functioning as receiver was easy the process of is visible on the phone then you know what is going on but on the headphones it wasn't easy. Overall after 3 days of use I am happy.
5,Easy to install ready to be use good BT sound !!!
5,I would give this 6 stars if I could. I'm picky and won't hesitate to give a negative review "if it's warranted"...This product lives up to all expectations. The audio sounds better than even a CD in my system streaming from bluetooth. You must however have an aptX sender signal to match with the Tronds aptX technology for superior sounding audio. I've tried several other adapters and they sound all right but this one is amazing and out performs them all.  The connection is stable and the unit is a breeze to operate. This can also be used in charging mode. So you can keep the charging cable plugged in while in use and never run out of battery.But the sound is the main thing....The audio is clean and pops with crisp highs and brilliant tight bass. What ever the quality of your stereo system is  the Trond will take it to its limit for quality stereo sound.Buy this!!!
5,To start Meow had a difficult time getting the item to connect. Meow is not sure if it is the fault of the item or the headphones Meow was trying to use. BUT...…...this item has too much delay in the signal to be able to use it for the purpose Meow intended. Meow was attempting to use it out of a guitar pedal box with music mixed in from a laptop. One CANNOT play music accompaniment with an instrument if there is even the slightest delay in the signal. So since this is the only reason Meow bought this the item is useless to Meow. Just disappointed.Edit: The seller was kind enough tp refund Meow for the item. So Meow has nothing to complain about.
5,I can’t speak for the battery charge as I constantly have it plugged in but overall I love the BT tx/rx receiver. The quality is great and it has very little lag when transmitting to my Alexa Echo speaker.The only dilemma with this setup is now when playing music through spotify on my Echo with the Trond Duo still connected from my TV it will pause the music at certain intervals. This is no fault of the transmitter rather the Echo checks for its connected bluetooth devices every 30 seconds or so. This can be fixed by turning the Trond transmitter off.Another benefit is the help that comes with this receiver. They have great documentation online for how to clear the device lists and other technical help. This made it super any to solve any problems I have.I’m pleased with my purchase and it has help make my room less cluttered with wires.
5,Installation and pairing with my bluetooth speaker was simple and effective.  The sound quality was very good and more importantly without any noticeable delay.  Very nice product.
5,This was so easy to connect to my Bose speaker and then I connected my iPod shuffle which isn’t Bluetooth and it sounds wonderful.  I love my Trond bluetooth transmitter.
3,i got this product about 6 months ago i play cd's with a portable cd player and wanted to use Bluetooth earphones so i could go through the house and do chores while listening to cd.  right off it seemed nice and worked ok but the distance was short so if the player was in the kitchen and i have a small house and i went into the bathroom maybe like 20 or 30 feet or in the basement or even around a wall it would lose connection so use it just for shorter distances.  The battery life has only been a few hours and after 6 months i lost stereo and i only have sound on one side and the little connector came loose and will not tighten which is probably why the stereo (both channels) doesn't work.  i feel that i handled it very carefully and it should not become loose and not connect properly after just 6 months.  Contacted trond and they gave me reset instructions and a replacement.  so i was happy with that warranty resolution.
5,One of my friends' wife needed new headphones while watching TV.  Neither of them have internet access nor desire to do so.  So I looked for a cost effective means of replacing the worn out headphones she was using.  I ultimately decided to use a bluetooth device rather than manufacturer supplied transmitter/headphone pair to keep future replacement costs low.After looking at the reviews of a number of bluetooth transmitters I finally settled on this one for good reviews simplicity effectiveness and price.  I made the right choice.After seeing her success I decided to buy my first bluetooth headphones and separate speaker for TV too as I am also hard of hearing.  So I bought one of these for myself as well!Works great!  I simply leave it plugged to a USB outlet so it effectively runs on house power 24 hrs/day.
5,I bought this to remedy a gaping hole in technology:  the lack of portable CD players that can connect to bluetooth headphones.  I've got a big CD collection and no desire to convert it to inferior MP3 audio.  The big guns like Sony gave up making portable CD players and the low-rent suppliers still making them have iffy quality.  I have a couple of portables a Sony and a Panasonic  that tether to corded headphones which is awkward.  Enter the TROND.  I gambled that it would work.  For once a gamble paid off.  In fact I bypassed my Bose bluetooth headphones app-based instructions and just pressed the button on the headphones and the one of the TROND and ... they connected right up!  And stayed that way 20-25 feet away from each other.  Sound quality is roughly equivalent to what a corded headset sounds like from the same CD player.  I'm happy.
4,This TROND unit has been very versatile for me so much so I now have 3 of them. I use them primarily to connect to a set of Bose noise cancelling headphones so I have only used the unit in the transmit mode. I use one unit on my home TV one unit to listen to TV at the club and one unit is connected to my PC at work (I tried the Bluetooth built into the PC and was constantly having connect problems). The fact that the unit has a battery is great and allows me to connect it to my iPod and use it when mowing the lawn. I have had no problems connecting BT between my headphones and any of these units.
4,Excellent device for the price. So far I have never experienced any issues with sound quality or lag works perfect with both of my wireless bluetooth earphones. The setup was extremely complex & difficult which is why the 4 stars or I would give this product 5 stars. I setup up so that it is constantly connected to the wall outlet via the usb cable so never used it’s battery to know how long it runs. Fantastic product highly recommend buying it. They should simplify the setup process somehow.
5,this is the 3rd transmitter I have purchased and the first one that actually works with the TV at the gym.
5,I wear hearing aids and needed a bluetooth device to transmit from my TV to my hearing aids.  This has worked wonderfully for me.  The sound quality is good and I get stereo in my hearing aids on programs that are transmitting in stereo.  Connectivity is a little weak when I walk the 30 feet into the kitchen.  I use it with it connected to a USB cable from my computer so it is always powered up but on the few occasions that I had that power source disconnected the battery seemed to last for about three to four hours.  It was super simple to connect and the cables that were supplied with it were all that I needed.  I followed the instructions and pairing was simple and worked the first time.  Highly recommend this item.
5,Connects and disconnects when told to without any hassle. Honestly I was not expecting this Bluetooth device to be any good and yet here I am to tell you that it is in fact very good. It pairs instantly with anything I try to connect it to. I have found no faults with it. Range clarity and even the battery life are all great. Honestly look no further.
3,I've tried to connect this to 3 different devices. Can't even get it to connect to ANY device. It DID get it to connect to a friend's device but that's as far as I got. Once it was connected nothing worked.
4,Update:The seller has responded to this review in a way that I think is valid. The problem is very likely that my bluetooth speaker does not have Aptx and that is the source of the latency problem. I'm upgrading to 4 stars and will move to 5 if/when I purchase a better bluetooth speaker and verify it.From the description of the product that had the words "low latency" in it I assumed it would be perfect for connecting my guitar to a bluetooth speaker. It is horrible. The delay between the guitar and the speaker is so long I can't use it at all. I expected more. On the plus side it is very small charges easily and fits in any pocket.
5,Really love this product! Using my Apple AirPods with the Trond transmitter plugged into the red/white aux ports on old Sony TV.First bought a more expensive TECBOSS transmitter but I kept getting this buzzing sound or weird noise gate effect in between dialogue during quiet movie scenes. It had optical and this TROND does not. But I really really prefer this adorable $30 little Trond.Pairs nice and aggressively with my airpods if both devices are on. Sound quality is great. I can control the volume with my TV without reducing quality. It comes in loud giving me a lot of room to adjust the volume with my remote.It is very tiny! Super super happy
5,Very small
5,Got this to replace an old BluBridge receiver in my car so I can stream music from my phone to my ancient cassette-radio unit with one of those cassette adapters which you then plug into the Bluetooth receiver.  If you have a cassette radio and no AUX input this is a great solution.This Trond unit connects very quickly and automatically.  I just push and hold the power button briefly and I'm streaming music in my car in just a couple seconds.The old BluBridge I had before needed to be manually connected to my phone each time which was a pain.I chose this Trond unit as well for other features I may appreciate in the future.1) It can be a receiver or transmitter2) it supports "aptX Low Latency" which is useful if you want to use it as transmitter to watch TV with headphones and not have lip movement out of sync (make sure your headphones support this feature as well).Very happy with this unit.
4,this is an ingenious device so simple and small and yet so useful and inexpensive.  I bought two: one to connect my old stereo system to my phone via blue tooth so I could play my music on the stereo speakers.  worked without a hitch.  The other one I used to connect to an old TV so I could listen to it on my blue tooth earbuds.  I had some trouble understanding the directions because the instructions are not very user friendly and the print that was used for the instructions requires an electron microscope BUT I emailed the company and they responsed immediately with further instructions which worked perfectly.  So I am now set.  I would give 5 stars but for the problems mentioned above.  Very cool technology.
2,Pros:The device connects quickly and setup is extremely easy. It is small light and portable. Battery life is quite good for the size of the device. I personally got 6-7 hours out of a single charge.Cons:At lower volumes (i.e. under 30% volume) the audio becomes fuzzy and static. When I pull the volume down to about 25% there is a sharp drop in the volume level for some reason. Apple mobile devices cannot take advantage of the AptX codecs advertised because it is proprietary technology owned by Qualcomm. This means that lower quality SBC is most likely used to transmit audio. TROND might support the higher quality AAC codec uses on iPhones/iPads but they never make that information clear on the product page. One star off from Bluetooth connectivity because it won’t allow me to use my headphone’s built in mic.Overall I’m disappointed with the performance of this product. Given the $32ish price I expected much more. I returned mine and I’m sure I can find something better. If TROND believes that my review is inaccurate I would be more than happy to revise it if they send me another unit. Otherwise. I would advise anyone reading this to look elsewhere.
5,I am using this this to transmit audio from an outdoor TV via the headphone jack to a portable LEPA BTS02 Bluetooth Speaker.  I use both a HDTV signal from a HDTV antenna and also an Amazon Fire Stick outside.  I previously was using the same setup outside but using a cheaper 2.1 Bluetooth transmitter.  The sound quality from my old transmitter tended to be distorted and the lower end (bass) was very sloppy and noticeable during loud action scenes.  I purchased this new TROND unit hoping to get better sound seeing that it was Bluetooth version 4.1 and that my LEPA speaker was Bluetooth 4.0.  Getting it paired to my speaker was simple and the improvement in sound was immediate! The sound is crystal clear and there is no distortion on the low end.  Voices are clear and the latency if any is minimal and not an issue.  I am very happy with this transmitter and only wish I had purchased it a year ago.
2,Will definitely be returning this product. Tested with both Pioneer overhead bluetooth headphones and Apple AirPods Pro. This is NOT a "Low Latency" device. It was impossible to play guitar with a metronome and also impossible to play fast because the delay confuses your brain.Other than that pairing with the headphones was very simple if you read the instructions. Using this for music would be fine but for TV you might notice a delay between the audio and the images (lips moving).
5,I have only used it for an hour or so with my ham radio but the setup was quick and it paired with a bluetooth headset and reconnects automagically when I turn it on.  I use it to listen to my Kenwood handheld transceiver so that the family is not required to listen to my hobby.. If I want to talk I simply pick up the radio. I like the size of the unit.  I used double sided tape to attach it to the bottom of the radio as the Trond is slightly wider which helps the radio to not fall over all the time. I made up a short cable to connect the radio to the Trond. The headset will connect to two devices. When I want to listen to the radio I disable BT on the iPhone and turn on the Trond. The headset makes the new connection. Beautiful!I have not tried to receive BT on the Trond.
5,I use this in transmitter mode only and found it very easy to set up and use. The range sound quality and low latency are excellent. I use a 1/4" audio plug adapter to plug it into the audio output jack of my sound system and pair it to a set of Bluetooth headphones. I keep it charged by plugging the USB charging cord into the amplifier USB port. When the amplifier is off I turn the TROND unit off as well so it won't discharge it's battery. It has always paired rapidly with my headphones when I power it up again. I put a piece of double-stick tape on the bottom side of it so it could be kept immobile in my audio equipment setup. I need only push down on the button on top to power it up or down. I tried another brand which was immediately unsatisfactory because it kept dropping the connection. But I love this one!
4,The Trond bluetooth transmitter works beatifully. Pairing could not be any easier. The one thing that really surprised me is how small the device is which is not readily apparent from looking at the pictures. It works fantastically well with the bluetooth earphones I ordered at the same time from Amazon. I only wish they would connect inmediately upon turning both units on sometimes it takes a little "tinkering" with the earphones to get the TV audio to come through but once it is on the sound is just mind blowing. I was having a real hard time catching a lot of the dialog content on some kinds of programming specially those with a lot of background music or action. Now I get to hear birds chirping and crickets cacophony in incredible stereo separation. I am truly happy with this transmitter.
5,I had issues with a Trond unit that was just out of warranty and the company was very responsive.
5,I connected it to the RCA audio out of my TV so I can connect my non-bluetooth tv with my bluethooth stereo headphones (the same ones I use with my cell phone) so I can watch TV without bothering my family (or being bothered by them ;)Pros:  Does exactly what is supposed to do automatic pairing works flawlessly hardly any noticeable latency more than adequate range to move around the house.  I use this old bulky RF headset. Is so small you won't even know is there (as opposed to RF wireless TV headphones which are bulky and  normally require a charging base).  Depending on the quality of the bluetooth headset you use you will get the same or better audio quality as with a mid-range RF plus the improved practicality and comfort of a bluetooth headset vs.the bulky over the ear headphones.Cons: short battery life can not be used while charging because you'll get high pitched feedback on your headset needs to be paired each time you turn it on.
5,I’ve only had my Trond BT-Duo a few days but so far I’m very happy with it. My car has hands-free phone BT but no music feature. My two previous BT music receivers with the hands-free phone feature both interfered with the built-in (steering wheel controlled) phone feature. Since there is no hands-free phone feature with this transmitter/receiver it doesn’t interfere with the built-in feature.The unit is small and light but also feels very solid. It only took about 15 minutes to get to a full initial charge. It paired instantly with my iP6S and has stayed paired. It connects immediately upon pushing the power button and it powers off automatically 10 to 15 minutes after turning off the car. You can of course turn it off manually if that delay is a concern. The sound is so much better than my two previous BT receivers and the volume is amazing. I have no need for the transmitter feature so I can’t comment on that feature. Overall I’m very pleased with the Trond unit and wish I had discovered it sooner.
2,I have it set up to my tv and connected to my Beats Headphone so I don’t bother my significant other during work. However you can’t control the volume on this device. I have my TV at max volume and it is outputting at maybe 40% max volume through my headphone.
4,Make sure you have low latency headphones if you plan on using this on your tv. Otherwise there's audio lag.
5,Works well with my audio player and Bluetooth ear buds
3,Very low sound connected to my Beats wireless solo 3 and it is so tiny and thin it is really hard to hear what is going on and this is with switch and target devices (like iphone 6s) at the normal sound level and for switch turning on max still is very tiny I use this primarily for switch and I can't hear a damn thing when I'm playing outside when I can easily turn on the volume by connecting directly to my iphone instead. Something is really wrong in the sound transformation in the device that it seems to ignore or turn down the sound volume. I haven't tried to pair with other bluetooth headset other than the beats so I don't know if this is a specific beats to trond problem but this is unacceptable.------- EDIT --------The customer service has been very swift and quick to respond to comments. It is really good compare to a lot of other products I have tried.The review will change again in a more accurate assessment after receiving a replacement. I look forward to it.
4,Thought it wasn’t going to work because I plugged it in my Xbox controller but once I hooked it up to the tv everything worked great and pairing two Bluetooths to it wasn’t hard at all I connected my Powerbeats pro and my AirPods at the same time and it sounds great all in all a great product for gamers and someone who just wants to watch movies with headphones no video lag or anything
4,I received TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter/Receiver today.  Despite seeing pictures of the device on the website previously I was amazed by its small size.  Following TROND customer service's email sent to me not long after I ordered the device I was able to pair the device with my Sony WH-1000XM2 headphone after two tries.  The sound was pretty good but I hoped it would be better.  Overall the sound was enjoyable.It also paired with my Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 Plus easily.Now I can use all my non-bluetooth audio/visual equipments with any bluetooth devices.---------Update:I used it as a bluetooth audio receiver with my non bluetooth earbuds.  It pairs easily with my Macbook Pro and my Samsung S7.
5,Worked exactly as I expected it to. I was trying to link up two different bluetooth sound systems and I did so with no problem. Setup was relatively easy and uncomplicated although I would say that reading the directions is a must as it's not totally straightforward. Everything worked first time and I haven't had a problem since. Battery life for me was about 6 hours of continuous use which is not bad considering the size and it works plugged in as well. The systems I was using it with were not low-latency however so I have no idea how well that works. The range is decent (as much as I could test it) even with walls and doors between it and the speakers; it was basically what my phone could achieve with the same sound systems.Overall a well-built little device that does exactly what I need it to do and at the price it's at it's great.
5,El producto es fácil de configurar y usar. La batería tiene un. Rendimiento aceptable de duración. Buena inversión
5,This inexpensive accessory has opened up new possibilities for serious music listening.  My 30 year old Sony Discman CD player which has amazing sonic qualities is now a bluetooth player!  My 10 year old Sansa MP3 player which is compatible with my high quality FLAC files is now a Bluetooth player.  I can walk all over my house wearing my JBL Bluetooth headphones and not skip a beat from these stationary devices.  Plenty of gain in the signal so I can really blast myself if I want to.  No problem whatsoever in pairing the devices.  The unit is extremely small and light so it's no problem adding to the small bulk and weight of the players.  I've yet to use it as a receiver to convert non Bluetooth headphones and speakers but I'm expecting good results.  Lot's of fun don't hesitate.
3,3/3/19 Update: I upped one star to 3 stars because customer support replaced my Trond v5.0 with a Trond BT Duo that worked fine with two headsets. I don't know if my v5.0 crackling was a fluke or not but the BT Duo does work as advertised and the seller made a great effort to make everything right.original:First I had a Toa Tronics bluetooth transmitter with 2 Trond headphones. There was noticeable lag when the second headphone was paired. So I returned the Toa transmitter and go the Trond transmitter to match the same company as the headphones. With both headphones paired there was no audio lag but one headset would have a crackling noise. With only one paired with either headphone there was no crackling. With 2 paired the crackling returned. So I have given up and ordered yet another Trond transmitter so there is one transmitter to pair with one headphone. Then there is no lag and good audio quality. But what a hassle figuring it out. Don't believe the claim that one transmitter will pair with 2 headphones.
5,This is a fantastic little gadget!  The distance it travels is amazing. My home is 2700+ sqft inside.  I have it located on my desk on one side of the house and the speaker I have it connected to can be moved outside to the patio on the opposite side of the house and still pick up a clean signal.  It provides a clear wifi connection that I needed for my Sirius XM radio. It only holds about a 2 hour charge so I just leave it plugged in when I'm using it no problem because my radio is plugged in.  I also use it on the TV I have in the laundry room; I connect the same speaker to it so that I can watch TV while I'm doing laundry since the TV speakers don't come through the washer and dryer noise.  I plan to purchase a couple more for some of my older devices so that I don't have to connect and reconnect.
5,This was an item that I didn’t even know I needed but found it when researching Bluetooth headphones and picked it up. I’m glad I did because it is quite useful.  I have used it in transmit and receive mode with no issues.One of my favorite things to use it for is for in-flight video players. It works great to provide low latency wireless audio to my headphones.  I have also used it with my TVs at home and my stereo with no problems.This is a great accessory and it is really tiny so very portable.  Highly recommend this product.***********************************************************************************************************************************************I rely on reviews when I make purchases so I put a lot of time into reviewing everything I buy on Amazon for personal and my business. Please show your appreciation by clicking the "helpful" below when it asks if the review is helpful!!!
4,I bought this so that I can access a huge trove of music stored on an ancient iPod using bluetooth earbuds. So far it works like a charm. Sound quality is excellent. Connectivity is instantaneous. All that remains to be seen is its lifespan. Hence four stars instead of five. I have had too many little Chinese gadgets croak prematurely not to be cautiously optimistic.
4,MY review is mixed. My specific reason for this purchase was to pair two Bose NC 35 head phones to my IPOD. it worked once. My Bose head phones pair simply with everything i try from my Droid phone to my IPAD the trond device wants to pair with all my other bluetooth devices in my home but the specific device (Bose NC35) i want to use it with has been nothing but a struggle. I have been to the Bose site for help i have been through the instructions for both device multiple times to be sure i have not missed a step or anything and still are unsuccessful.UPDATE: with some tech help and sequences the duo has paired successfully multiple times with my Bose NC 35 head phones now.
5,I have used this versatile unit in both the transmit and receive modes with excellent results. It has seamlessly and consistently provided a link for all of my desired uses. For example it's added a new life for an older iPod as a music source. Another recent application has been in a system to monitor wild bird sounds at a feeder. A Vanxse outdoor microphone directly feeds into the BT-DUO via a 65' Cat5 cable. The unit then transmits out to a UE Boom 2 speaker providing clear undistorted sound. While planning this system I had a few questions regarding the feasibility of a microphone feed into the BT-DUO. I emailed Trond's customer service and received a prompt and thoughtful response from Bruce. Based on his initial response and then from a series of follow ups I trust that Trond is a company that truly wants to do what is best for it's customers. Thanks!
5,Does what it is suppose to do without attention. . . including pairing headphones just by turning them on. Make the connection once and you are done.Great Product.
5,The transmitter works very well and pretty far from the device it plugs into.  I have paired two devices with it and attached it to my TV.  No problems so far and I have owned it for approximately a month.  I use it mainly when I am working out on my treadmill so I don't have to turn the TV volume up really loud.
5,When we bought our BMW we were told that it had bluetooth connectivity for both the phone and music streaming. Drove it off the lot and after many failed attempts at streaming music from my phone and a youtube video later I determined that it did NOT have the music feature but only the phone feature. BMW of course wanted me to sell my soul to add that feature after the fact (even though the salesman said it was there) so I found this on Black Friday and decided to give it a try. It was easy to setup and works perfectly and it causes no conflicts with using my phone as an actual phone through the car's existing system. The only *minor* issue that I have with it is that it doesn't automatically connect when I get into the car. I have to turn it off and turn it back on but then it connects right up. Again that's just a minor (albeit #firstworldproblems) annoyance.
5,I could not have asked for a better product.  I wanted to buy the Trond Bluetooth Transmitter for my IPod Classic (yes I still have one) so I could pair my wireless headphones and listen to my music.  The package arrived ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.  The instructions were easy to follow and I was listening to my music in minutes (it actually took longer to open the package than it took to set it up).  I had read reviews that I could expect a loss of sound quality but I haven't detected any loss of quality.  I am very happy with this product and I highly recommend it.
4,I was skeptical at first due to the fact my supposed new product had its security seal missing as it was evident that it was supposed to be there due to the circular residue that was left behind from when it was removed. But after taking not much more than a minute to have it hooked up and paired I was relieved to see it actually working and really happy with its size and how great the sound was but i only did get to test it within 15’ as of yet I will update my review if I come up with any issues.
5,This tiny little transmitter is hardly noticeable on my guitar peddle board plugged into the headphones jack on my Alto ZMX52 5 Ch mixer. The battery charge lasts far longer than I can play but the best thing about it is the codec that it uses ( Bluetooth V4.1 W/ aptX Low Latency ).I have read lots of forums about trying to use Bluetooth headphones while playing musical instruments and they all say that the lag (or Latency) is noticeable and not good. Well they haven't tried one using this codec with a set of headphones using the same codec. I connected this Trond with an Aventree Wireless (or wired) Bluetooth over the ear headphones and Wha la it has absolutely no detectable latency. The 2 items cost me hundreds of dollars less than a radio frequency setup and with NO BELT PACK OR WIRES. And if you want you can have your smart phone connected at the same time. It's amazing.
5,Trond customer service is excellent. They quickly respond to any question you ask. Really a joy to deal with.
4,This device works almost exactly as advertised. It connects easily and reliably.  The sound quality is excellent for audio books (I have not used it for music so I cannot address that application).  The charging/storage pod works beautifully.  My only problem is that the ear pods do not fit reliably enough to allow me to use them while I walk the dog in the dark.  I have to restrict my use to the daylight so that I can find one if it falls out.
5,This device was used to link a blue tooth speaker to a inexpensive tv with poor quality internal speakers. The tv is used in florida on an outside patio thus the low cost tv. The benefit to my surprise was the quality of the sound. The speaker was placed at least 20ft from the tv behind the listener since the objective was to hear the sound. Great quality no lag. The tv did not have any audio output jacks. I connected the tron to the audio output jacks on the cable box itself. An added benefit is  the cable box has a usb port which allows direct charging by way of usb port. No need to turn unit off & on or to reconnect. The only down side you have to adjust volume on speaker separate from your tv remote. Tv speakers are placed on mute to avoid echo.
4,Love the wireless connection actually use them to listen to music from my TV while on treadmill without a cord to mess with. The battery is great and latest's for weeks be pending on how much it is used. Heavy use and you will have to charge it more often. Its perfect if you have a Furnace or Washer or Dryer that could demise your sound quality while watching TV. high end sound quality connecting. Only issue I've had is you sometimes have to work with it a bit to connect to headphones. It connects perfectly rest of the times. This is expected with any wireless technology thou.David Conn
5,Thank you
5,Finally got an opportunity to test out the transmitter on one of my flights. It works perfectly. Connected with my BOSE QC35 II. No issues connecting to the transmitter. The BOSE headphones only allowed one device to be connected (the transmitter) when using it. Had to disconnect my other devices from the headphones for the transmitter's audio to come through. The airplane's PA system and audio throughput quality will vary depending on each aircraft. There was some choppiness in the PA system that at the time I mistook for the device not connecting well via BT to my BOSE headphones. But it was never the Trond transmitter having the problem. I highly recommend it to anyone who has BOSE wireless headphones and are frequent flyers looking for a way to use their wireless noise canceling headphones with aircraft TV systems.
3,This device has been both a disappointment and an adequate solution to the problem of using an older iPod classic with bluetooth headphones. After first charge the device "worked" for about 5 hours (of a 14 hour flight). The sound was adequate but not great. However the device would not take a full charge using the airplane usb port. After "charging" for about 4 hours it would not pair with the headphones and I could not get anything but the pulsating blue (low charge indicator) light. No sound transmission via bluetooth. After arriving at my destination I attempted to charge using my laptop. Still no luck and the only indication of activity was pulsing blue light and still would not pair with headphones. I tried one time on my return flight still would not pair. However when I arrived back home I gave it one more try and the Trond 2 device DID pair with my headphones. Have not made another attempt as I don't use wireless headphones except on airplanes. So when it works the performance is adequate but I have no idea when it will work.
5,This small inexpensive device solved a problem I was having trying to have audio from my TV transmitted simultaneously to the TV audio output and my Bluetooth headphones.  After several conversations with tech support at Yamaha (my AV receiver) I was about to come to the conclusion that it couldn't be done.  HOWEVER after purchasing Yamaha Bluetooth sound bar and Sony Bluetooth headphones I discovered a "work around" that allowed audio to come from the sound bar and headphones at the same time.  This great Bluetooth transmitter transmits audio to more than one device (sound bar and headphones).  Now I can listen to audio on the headphones at the volume I need while my wife can listen at her preferred volume via the Yamaha sound bar.Anyone needing to have this set up should seriously consider the TROND Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter Receiver.By following the directions I found it easy to set up and connect to both the sound bar and headphones.
3,It worked once and was able to connect two headphones. However the next day one of the wireless headphones would randomly disconnect and give a very loud white noise. It happened several times. There was.also a noticeable lag in the sound. I ended up returning it.
4,The Trond BT-Duo works as advertised.  Initially I had trouble with the volume being too low when using my SanDisk Sport Clip to BT devices.I e-mailed Customer Care and they responded promptly.  Bruce was patient and polite.  Within a couple e-mails he was able to instruct me on how to remedy my problem.  I would like to say Bruce responded to my e-mails faster than I would reply to his e-mails.Battery Life for the BT-Duo exceeded my expectations.  I like that the unit comes with the necessary cables and  3.5 connector to utilize my BT-Duo.  I would recommend this product.
3,Do not buy. I purchased this product to allow my ancient iPod to connect to wireless headphones at the gym but it has broken after only a few months. Additionally it did not allow good volume control so I could barely hear my music at the gym over a small amount of background noise (a problem I never have with the iPod itself or my wireless headphones when used with another device).Update: TROND customer service reached out quickly and offered to ship a free replacement for the broken item. I have received a new one which works hopefully it will outlast the previous device. Still unable to set the volume loud enough to hear over moderate ambient noise.
4,I use this with my not smart TV to hear better. The product works well (though it takes a bit of thumb work to connect). There is a very small delay between the TV and the headset. If I am using closed ear headphones I do not notice it but I do notice it with open ear headphones. I am not disappointed at all in the product or its performance though.
5,Bought this so I can listen in on zoom for my kindergarteners. Easy to set up and no issues with sound once both Bluetooth headphones are connected. Sometime when the second headphones are out of range I have difficulty reconnecting for the sound. But a quick turning off and on solves it fast. Less than 30 seconds and it’s all good to go. We use a random Bluetooth headphones bought on Amazon and airpods to pair.
2,I loved this - I used it in my car to play audio from my phone.  It worked pretty well - until about 3 months in.  It started to have some problems connecting but it still worked for the most part.  Within a month it was dead.  I've tried charging it and nothing.  Just dead.  When it worked I really liked the product.  But for 4 months of functioning it was not worth it.**Note - TROND Customer Service reached out to me and is sending a replacement unit.  Their customer service has been very good despite my purchase dying after the replacement timeframe had expired.  I will update my review in a few months if my new unit is still working well.
5,This TROND unit works beautifully!  The range is every bit of 30 feet + line of site and 20 feet + through a single wall.  I am Using  this device in conjunction with Sony  MDR-ZX770DC Bluetooth Headphones(Quite Excellent I might add) and the wide range frequency signal transmission provides excellent lows mids and highs.  I have only used the TX function so far so I can't provide feedback on the receiver at this time.Pairing worked well with a couple of different devices. (I did learn that good quality Bluetooth connectivity requires good equipment! no exceptions!).  The ability to use this unit while plugged into a USB power source is a big plus. All of this capability in a device which is less than half the size of a business card(Length~45ml width~33ml) with a depth of ~10ml is impressive.This device has worked very well for me and and I recommend it because of its capability and power versatility.

5,I needed a way to stream music from a computer with it's Bluetooth function disabled to a AmazonBasics 2.1 Channel Bluetooth Sound Bar across the room. Setup went flawlessly; switched the Trond transmitter to TX mode and turned it on long pressed the button until it started to flash turned on the AmazonBasics 2.1 Channel Bluetooth Sound Bar Bluetooth function set the Trond unit on top of the sound bar and *boom* they paired instantly. I have since turned both on and off several times and they never fail to pair automatically when turned back on. Easy to use and an excellent value if you need a way to stream audio from a 3.5 mm jack to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones. I haven't tried to use it to pair to two devices at the same time so I can't speak to that feature.
5,This comes with well-written i.e. comprehensible English-language instructions it works as advertised and does a pretty good job. I was able to plug it into a 10-year-old classic iPod and then pair it with a good Klipsch BT receiver/speaker then connect it to a 20-year-old Yamaha receiver via the headphone jack and pair it to the same speaker. Note that if you get one of these and try plugging it into a source the short 3.5mm connecting cord that comes with it is mono at one end and stereo at the other. The stereo end is meant for the source assuming that it is a stereo source and the mono end plugs into the Bluetooth Transmitter. The same applies to a 1/4" adapter jack for the source if one is required. If you try plugging it into the source with the mono end it won't work. I would definitely buy another one and recommend them to a friend.
3,Only gonna give it a 3 for now though it's not necessarily the fault of this product.  I probably missed it in the ad and got a little too happy with clicking "add to cart" before I realized that this little device will not work with a smart TV.  My main purpose of buying this was to transmit sound from my LG to a pair of headphones.  Problem is my TV (and most modern TV's?) doesn't have a 3.5mm headphone out jack on it.  Womp womp. Yes this kit does come with the RCA to 3.5mm adaptor but that still didn't help.  My LG only has 3 sound options in settings: internal speakers LG sound sync (no clue) and something called "optical out" which I'll assume is from the rear LAN port. Next test for this device is pairing a cell phone to car stereo and then guitar amp to wireless headphones.  If I'm successful I'll keep it.  If not...in the bin it goes.
5,So pleased with this.  Connected so well with my wireless headphones and my unit hooked up to the TV.
5,I got an excellent response from customer service when I had a question. They resolved my issues. I would suggest this product very much
4,Works well within 20 feet of my earbuds after that it breaks up. I have it connected to my tv so I can listen without waking others. Suits that purpose well as long as you are within 20 feet of it.
4,It works pretty good once it pairs with my Motorola S305 headset. Once the TROND starts flashing red-blue it will usually pair right away. Occasionally there will be a second or two of sound then silence for a few seconds and then the sound comes back. Once it is paired it stays connected even as I move around the room. I connected the USB cable to a port on my Samsung TV that keeps the TROND charged all the time so I only need to remember to charge the headset. There is a slight delay that is noticeable when the TV is too loud and I am using the headset as I hear the TV slightly ahead of the headset.
3,PROS:Pairs easily with headphonesSmall unobtrusiveComes with all cables & attachments neededIncluded directions are actually clearly worded and easy to understand customer service and support are top notchVolume level is surprisingly strongCONS:Audio delay of approx 1/4 second making it unusable for my purpose:  watching TV with friends and being able to listen through my own bluetooth headphones due to hearing impairment. Because of the audio lag from the Bluetooth transmitter it sounds like I'm listening to a loud and annoying echo.  To verify that it's the transmitter and not my headphones I duplicated the problem with a different bluetooth speaker then plugged the speaker directly into the included RCA/mini splitter.  When plugged directly into TV no delay.BOTTOM LINE:If you are using this for the purpose I am it's no good.  However if you're using it to watch TV by yourself via Bluetooth headphones (with no TV volume) then it's OK.  The audio delay is not quite bad enough to create visible lip sync errors.
5,I am using this Bluetooth device with an LG TV and it works great. It did take me a couple of tries so passing this along in case it's helpful to you.The audio menu on the LG 55EF9500 has several choices including Audio Out and Wired Headphones (see pic). I originally selected Audio Out because that's the port I am using for the Bluetooth transceiver. That didn't work. The headset would pair successfully but I couldn't hear anything.The right setting is actually Wired Headphones. Even better I'm using the Internal TV Speaker + Wired Headphones. That way I can control the volume on the headset and TV speaker independently and I don't have to review this menu every time I want to watch TV. If I want to use the headphones all I have to do is press the button on the Bluetooth device to connect and I'm good to go.
4,I would say this is a must have for any Nintendo Switch owner. It works great with my AirPods. It also works well with my Nintendo 3DS but the volume is a bit low. It would be great if they added a volume button to the device.
5,I pur chased this transmitter/receiver so I could use my LG Toner Pro headset with both my Samsung Android phone and listen to music or watch my LG tv at the same time. My TV is several years old and doesn't have such niceties as Bluetooth a USB port or even a headphone jack. It was important to me because I have a hearing problem so I was understanding only about every other word and music sounded awful - even with my hearing aids (which are lousy!). Your device allowed me to use that headset to hear the TV with wonderful sound. I now understand just about everything (which actually is not necessarily a good thing if you know what I mean).It was pretty easy to set up although I had one problem which was solved in paqrt by eTROND's customer service and my reading my headset's owner's manual.I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone.
4,We searched for a while for a solution that would allow us to connect 2 separate BT headpieces to the TV while we worked out together. This one works beautifully with our current equipment. It plugs easily into the headphone jack on the TV and transmits reliably to both of our headsets. We get excellent sound and have no trouble hearing over the sound of the treadmill. We haven't had any dropouts or lost signals.
4,Syncing can be a major pain at times but has Synced to 4 different bluetooth headphones and speakers and all work perfectly.Found it will immediately pair with previously paired devices as long as it is always powered on so great for a work pc that doesn't have bluetooth. If it does power off all devices will be lost from memory and will need to be repaired.Don't like that the usb charging port is on the same side as the 3.5mm jack it tends to cause usb cables to get in the way and be a slight annoyance but by all means not a significant problem.
4,Liked it enough to buy 2 more.First this comes pretty well packaged.  It's small and light.  I wanted it to use with an IPOD classic.  This TROND is so light I can just let it hang from the IPOD by the audio cable.  Would not do that if I were running but I just use them while working outside.  Took a while to pair up with some Arriva Leo headphones but once I got them paired it works very well.  Only one thing to report.  If the TROND touches the IPOD case you get static.  I checked and don't think it's the audio cable. When I put the IPOD in a case no amount of motion causes static.
5,My mother needs to listen to the tv at a higher volume. Since buying Trond v5 we can enjoy watching television together at a reasonable volume. You can also change your tv setting to channel the sound solely through the Bluetooth device.
5,I was a bit worried that this would not work for what I needed it for. I have two Harmon Kardon Onyx Studio Bluetooth speakers that I have been wanting to play simultaneously. I usually stream Spotify via my iPad but had only been able to connect to one speaker at a time. This device TOTALLY solved the problem! I wanted to use the Trond right out of the box as I was anxious to get the speakers amped up but followed the instructions included with unit and and waited until it was fully charged. Very unlike me. The set up instructions were straight forward and actually very polite. They used the word "please" many times in their instruction booklet. The type in the booklet was super tiny and difficult to read for these old eyes but I managed. Once the speakers were paired to TROND the sound quality was VERY good considering music was playing wirelessly through bluetooth!
4,This is a great little product. Gave me the ability to turn my ipod classic wireless. The only down side and reason i took a star off is because the control interface of ALL my BT headphones won't work with this when using it as a transmitter for an MP3 player (ipod or other). If i could use this and and still use the control interface on my heaphones (playpausenextback) i would give it 10 stars.
5,I'm using it as a transmitter. I bet most folks prefer to make their non-wireless speakers turn wireless but I have a 3rd gen Apple TV which cannot output bluetooth audio to my bluetooth speaker. So... I plug in Apple TV via HDMI into my projector (HDMI transmits sound and video). TROND is plugged into a projector Audio Out. It worked perfectly from the first try. Had to pair with my speaker and bam it's done. The only maintenance item is having to turn TROND off after being done watching projector/apple tv setup so my bluetooth speaker is not occupied with TROND pairing and I can use other devices with it. TROND is persistent and kicks off phone or other bluetooth sources from my speaker. I really don't mind pressing a button on and off though when I'm about to watch Apple TV
5,Works flawlessly and performs well. I have it plugged into the audio jack on a small kitchen TV and transmitting to a small portable bluetooth speaker. This lets me move the speaker to the kitchen table so we can hear the audio clearly without jacking up the TV volume too much and annoying the neighbors. When we aren't eating the speaker goes back near the TV and out of the way. The transmitter is always plugged into a power source and there have been no issues with that.I have noticed a small lag when the speaker is placed more than10-12 feet away from the transmitter. It isn't enough to bother us just a few milliseconds. When the speaker is close to the transmitter there is no delay at all. Apparently distance matters and I don't think that is the fault of the transmitter but rather just a function of how bluetooth works.
3,This item did not work for me. I had it plugged in to my video projector and paired with my soundbar (10 feet away). There was a noticeable lag between audio and video. Seems like this might work well for audio only.
4,It sounds good but it will not remember the paired device unless it's plugged in for charging. That's the reason for the 4 stars. I plugged it into a spare apple charging block to supply power constantly. The device will charge up & pair up to my headphones when the TV is turned on. I bought a pair of Naztech i9 BT ANC headphones works great with NO lag. When the TV is turned off the blue light constantly flashes looking for the headphones until I switch them on again. It will charge and broadcast at the same time. WE will see how long it will last. Princess will be happy not hearing the TV on after midnight.
5,The Trond Bluetooth receiver/transmitter is a really great choice if that’s what you’re looking for. This is our second one our first is still working perfectly fine but my husband wanted one in his shop. Initially I thought the first one wasn’t  working properly until I decided to read the directions. It is super easy to use. Just remember it takes about 3 seconds to make the connection so just give it the few seconds it takes and it does connect after you hear it connecting. Oh if you have used it for a device be sure to disconnect it from that one before trying to connect a different one.  I would have saved a lot of time if I read that short list of instructions before using. A really good choice!
5,Bought this to plug into my camper T.V. to link it to my Blu-tooth stereo; WOW!!! I plugged the audio cable in and used the USB charge cord on the same T.V. to keep it charged. Pushed the button twice and that was it paired and the sound is amazing. No lag in sound vs. movie action. Note: Do know that your device that you want transmitted controls the level of sound sent. To clarify set the volume on the T.V. at about normal listening then adjust receiver volume. This operator error on my part held me up for about 5 minutes. I have only tested it once and have not watched a whole movie with it yet but so far so good. Now I can hang my camper T.V. outside and enjoy a movie under the stars with no speaker wires to worry about. Hope this helps future buyers.
5,Works great. Perfect for Bose qc35 Bluetooth headphones. Already Hooked up to TV cable box and more.Update 2017-07-10: I've been using this for quite a while now without a single issue and love it. However all of the sudden a few weeks ago I came across an odd connection issue. I had trouble pairing my headphones to the transmitter and decided to message TROND customer care for help or replacement. They responded very quickly and gave me instructions on how to troubleshoot and it was easily and quickly resolved with their help. They apparently updated the manual to include the troubleshoot information shortly after I bought the product so they sent me a digital copy of the new manual. I'm pretty impressed by their customer service and the product has worked flawlessly every since I reset it following their instructions. Highly recommend the product and the company.
4,Works very good.  Can listen to the football game while going to the kitchen and back with a wall between my headphones and the TV.  Needs to be recharged a little more often than I want because I use more than I thought.  Getting about 8 hours use now between charges.  Didn't realize how handy this would be.  Only one minor issue with lip sync while channel surfing but moved on and settled on channel to watch with no issues.  This transmitter and a good pair of headphones have given me and my wife the peace and tranquility we wanted while watching football on the weekends for me and daytime talk shows for her :-)
4,Great product.  It transmits and receives as advertised.  I've used it with my TV to listen to audio to my Bose BT earbuds and my Bose BT Soundlink mini speaker.  No noticeable lag that I can perceive.  The only complaint I have is the placement of the light that tells you if you are in pair mode etc.  It's located on the perimeter of the switch and I have big fingers so it's hard to see exactly what mode it's in.  Other than that recommended.I did pair both my earbuds and speaker to it at the same time without any problems following the included instructions.  NEAT!
5,Paired these with my headphones with zero issues. Love that you can have two devices connected at one time. No issues at all. Great way to get wireless headphone for watching TV on a TV that does not have blue tooth connectivity. Worth every penny.
5,So far I had used this on all my flights. Love being able to move around in my seat without wires all over the place. In fact the transmitting of the sound is wonderful to the point that I left my seat to go to the restroom and the transmitting of the music kept playing. I didn't realize that the connection was coming from my airline seat until I was wondering where the music was coming from in the restroom hahaha
5,This was my very first Bluetooth device (besides the obvious items that come with Bluetooth already) and I really didn't know what I was doing but the instructions were thorough and helpful and I got the thing working in 30 minutes. The delay was only due to the Bluetooth speakers I was pairing it with. This item the transmitter itself was an easy set up. I use it so I can listen to my Echo Dot in two different rooms simultaneously so if I am cleaning I don't have to pause my music or audiobook or whatever while I am in the other room. I also move the transmitter over to my computer or ipod easily if I want to listen to those instead. From a Bluetooth beginner I am very happy I purchased this item.
5,Whole most phones and laptops these days come Bluetooth ready some hardware still does not. I use this for those items (older desktops televisions and my Nintendo switch. This device connects easily to my sound peats (that's with a p) wireless headphones and has not failed me yet. The only thing I cannot attest to is battery life as I constantly keep mine charged but I have used it for an acceptable amount of time between charges. If you have older wireless headphones the signal and quality will be reduced but I have not had this issue with my headphones. I find this product to be well worth its price.
5,I will confess that I ordered this Bluetooth adapter with some skepticism as it was the 4th brand we were trying (one from Best Buy and 2 from Amazon). I persisted because I was "desperate" to find an adapter so my husband could not only hear the dialogs on TV better but I could also get some peace (lol). The Trond adapter worked fine the day it arrived and then the following day it did not work. I sent an email to Trond and they replied immediately with directions on how to reset the adapter. It has worked ever since. If you are shopping for a Bluetooth adapter for the TV this is the one to try.....how can you lose with excellent customer service and an 18 month warranty?
4,The first three weeks these were amazing. It allowed me to use my AirPods with my Dell laptop. However I didn’t use them for a week and upon trying again- they wouldn’t connect so I had to unpair/repair. When they finally did they cut out after half a song. Too late to return which is unfortunate.*****UPDATE*****Someone from the company reached out to me and said that since there was a one year warranty I could get a refund or replacement. I am going to cross my fingers and try a replacement. Maybe mine was just a dud!
5,Once I figured out that the H/P port on my TV was the headphone jack everything worked seamlessly. I’ll be getting another for my TV upstairs.  You could use this for anything!
3,Good idea but poorly executed by this device. I go through the pairing setup with two bluetooth headphones and begin my walk with my partner. We do not stray more than 5 feet apart during the walk but one headphone will quit receiving.  It will not reconnect without rebooting the phone and going through the pairing sequence again.  A royal pain in the rear.  I do not want to use this device again.Works great.....while it works.1/22/18 UPDATE: I have upgraded to 2 stars because the manufacturer contacted me trying to help.  Unfortunately the is no solution available for pairing two bluetooth headphones even if the headphones are identical.  I have no use for the device for any other purpose so I cannot speak to the device's performance.The manufacturer did provide me with a no argument refund well after the Amazon refund period had passed so kudos for that!  Maybe that's worth 3 stars so I'll change.
5,I purchased a pair of Trond Bluetooth receiver and transmitter with APTX LL to watch TV using my regular headphones. However I noticed a slight audio delay which was causing me a headache. I wrote Trond customer support to see if I was missing something or if there's any configuration that I can change. Bruce from Trond customer support responded the same day and offered  to send me a another product the BT Duo X to try. I took up on his offer and a replacement was promptly sent to me in a few days. The audio delay is almost gone and I am very happy with the new setup! I have bought many electronic audio and tv gadgets from Amazon. This by far is on top of my list in terms of customer support and value! Will definitely recommend to friends.
5,I got this for my Switch which curiously uses Bluetooth to pair to controllers got an update forever ago to support USB audio devices and still doesn't have support for Bluetooth audio output.My setup for this was to take it out of the box connect it to the headphone jack on my Switch and a nearby USB port to charge flip the TX/RX switch over to TX (transmit) read the manual when I was finally a little confused pair it with my earbuds notice a background buzz disconnect the USB cable stop hearing the buzz and play. I'm guessing a ferrite on the cable would help here which is easy enough to add later but it isn't like the battery life is too short to just keep it unplugged during use.
5,This things work out great i have my TV across the room from my stereo I put one on both (one of them gets power from my TV's USB) and they sync up perfectly.  The only two hiccups I had was that my TV has the headphone jack volume separate from the main volume and these things don't require much signal to work which resulted in them being way overdriven upon first use.  Once I figured that out I dropped the volume and use the stereo to control the sound and they sound great now.  The other hiccup they do go into sleep/off mode when they aren't used for a time so I had to rearrange things a little so I could reach the buttons on both in order to turn them on and resync them as needed.  No biggie.
5,The battery life is great it is very nice that there is an indicator that visually tells you when the battery is getting low. I also love the fact that you can continue to use the adapter while charging it.Range: I can freely move about my 2 bed 2 bath apartment without the audio cutting off way better than my previous RF headphones I had.Audio Quality (TX mode): Great audio quality I am using the adapter with SONY XB950 headphones and they work great together with the x-bass activated it doesn't muddy the mid to high ranges sounds are very clear and it has an excellent audio range.Overall very happy with the purchase
5,I have a Echo Dot that has Bluetooth capabilities my Bose acoustic doesn't. When setting up the system you have to charge the Trond. When the unit is charged you have to put it in the RECEIVER MODE.  Once in the receiving mode you select setup on your Alexa download program on your iphone (mine is a Mi 5X).  If your Echo Dot is programed with your iphone you select Bluetooth press the on button on your Trond for 2 seconds; when light turns blue it is on. Tape the button 2 times and the light flashes rapped between red and blue. Press pair on your iphone and the unit should pair.  Then just hook up your Trond to you Bose unit and it should work.
5,This is a great little device that allows you to make a Bluetooth connection either from a non-Bluetooth device to a Bluetooth enabled device (transmit or tx mode) or from a Bluetooth device to a non-Bluetooth device (receive or rx).  I use it with my Siriusxm  portable radio which for some reason is not Bluetooth to transmit either to my portable Bluetooth speaker when outdoors or to my Denon AVR when indoors.  The performance has been flawless it pairs with no problems and I haven't experienced any latency issues.  The battery life is acceptable as is the recharge time of 2 hrs.  Keep in mind it can only remember the last device connected so if you are switching between devices like I do you will need to pair each time you switch.
5,Great device. I use it as a receiver to my BT Diamondboxx Model M speaker which does not have aptx. I pair it to both my Asus Zenpad and Asus phone which both have aptx and when connected both devices show the QUALCOMM aptx logo.  I wanted to get the most out of my Diamondboxx and the Trond Duo does the task and the sound it amazing. I also had a small issue with the Trond not powering off and 'stuck'. I sent an email and within 15 minutes they responded with a fix. It IS in the instructions which I missed. If it ever happens to you then do this: Hold down the MFB and while holding it down connect the 5v external USB and the device will power down.
4,It’s a little tricky getting this connected both as a transmitter and a receiver however once connected the device remembers the connection (Pairing stays good in both modes! The lag or latency is about .25 seconds behind - so that I guessI can live with !
2,Worked once never would charge again. When it did work it dropped connection and with volume on max sounded low. Do not recommend this device.
2,I should stop buying cheap junk on amazon and expecting it to perform. The audio quality is garbage. Not only did I have to crank the volume up way higher than any other device requires (eg. 2-3x) but the transmitter failed to transmit any part of an audio track that didn’t hit a certain threshold so for instance the sound of background voices footsteps etc in a movie were completely muted and then the audio would spontaneously pick back up when one of the main actors was speaking. In addition the feedback when the device is plugged in is horrendous. Yes you can mitigate this somewhat by using higher quality chargers with proper shielding but it’s still noticeable. I’ll be promptly returning this device.Edit: for all of the faults of the product I have to commend the company for their customer service. Their representative Bruce proactively reached out to offer an explanation for the product’s subpar performance and a full refund and followed up a few days later to make sure I received the refund. I’m not going to alter my rating but I definitely want to give credit where it’s due in case you think the product will work for you
5,Good value works like they advertised and connects to my ear buds just fine. Two things to know - there is a very slight delay from the tv to when you hear it....I was aware of this possibility and the company mentions it could happen in some situations but it has not been any problem for me. The other issue is that when you connect the usb cable to charge the unit you cannot use it at the same time.
3,I bought the TROND BT-DUO in order to watch TV without disturbing others.  The range is advertised to be 30+ feet.  The unit arrived with a standard very short cord with which to be attached to the back of my TV.  At a range of about 12 feetwhen paired with my high quality LG blue tooth earbuds the signal was intermittent.  After purchasing from Best Buy an extension for the cord provided I was able to move the unit from behind my TV and the signal is much better with only occasional distortion.  The flat screen TV may have caused some kind of interference.  My suggestion to TROND is that they consider providing a cord that is at least 12 inches long with the unit.  In fairness I did contact TROND customer support.  I was told that I am the first person to report this sort of problem to them.  Customer support suggested that I try adding the extension.
5,I love how easy this is to setup and use. I have one on my wall-mounted tv and one on my powered speakers (on the floor) so that I don’t have any wires showing. The only problem is that the sound cuts out during low volume spots. For example when watching Netflix the music cuts out when the dialogue stops. When the speaking starts again the background sounds return... until the speaking stops again... it gets really annoying. I eventually just went back to the good ole RCA to 1/8” cable and the sound is fantastic.
5,This was my first Bluetooth Transmitter ( haven’t tried the receiver yet) I had originally purchased a RF Transmitter but returned because too POPPY. I went with this Bluetooth based on reviews and the reviews are absolutely correct. No issues Sounds Great.  I don’t used the charge it and then use it; I utilize my USB on the back of the TV and just leave powered on whenever the TV’s on.
1,TL;DR: Audio cuts in and out at low volumes on certain devices (like my Nintendo Switch) the company clearly doesn't want you to know that and almost all other similar compact transmitters have the same problem.I purchased this specifically for use with my Airpods and Nintendo Switch. I cannot attest to the overall audio quality range latency or battery life because the device has one glaring "feature" that kept me from even being able to try it: the audio stream is dropped when the audio output (in this case my Switch's 3.5mm jack) dips below a certain unknown threshold. Basically if there isn't enough sound the transmitter enters a sort of "power saving mode" until enough sound is produced again. While playing at a low volume (around 10-15%) quieter moments constantly cut in and out like they're being muted and unmuted over and over. Turning up the volume all but eliminates this problem but I have no need for a product that only works well at specific volumes or higher.In my opinion the absolute lack of information regarding this "feature" should be considered false advertising. You shouldn't be able to sell a product that literally ceases to function under normal circumstances without CLEARLY explaining that functionality. Apparently this and other similar products make no mention of this anywhere in their product manuals websites or product descriptions. There are other reviews buried here and elsewhere describing the same issue with different audio output devices so this is not a Switch-specific problem. Contact with customer support has not been helpful; they have only suggested returning the item.This product may be great in every other way but the omission of such an important detail is inexcusable.
5,I'm using this primarily with a Uniden scanner and it works really well.  The only issue I have is the distance but that is probably due to the ~2Ghz los freq.  Only once did I notice any effect on the scanner reception and that was only when I plugged it into the headphone jack (that is right next to the antenna) using the metal mini jack adapter that came with the blue tooth and that was only noticed on one freq.  The battery outlasts whatever bluetooth earbuds or headphones I use.  I have not used it in receive mode.
4,It arrived in good shape though needed full charge.  Sounds good clear and sharp but range is limited to 15' and not an inch more.  Obstructions also cause flaking out to include me standing between my pc and stereo. Since my system is across the room it did not work well so had to reroute wires to get it to perform adequately.  Not what I was hoping for.Update:  Well I spoke too soon. Tried the Trond with my iPhone6 and it works 40-50 feet away 2 rooms away no skips or cracks.  So much for my HP tower Bluetooth.  No complaints now.
5,I am very pleased with this unit. I purchased a transmitter from a local store but returned it. It would not transmit 10' through a wall in my mobile home. This unit covers almost my whole house. Very good range. I tested receive mode with my laptop and a set of desk top speakers. It worked very well but I cannot testify as to range because it was just a short distance. My main application is a desk top radio connecting to Bose headphones. I like the feature that this unit has an input jack and not an integrated "pigtail". It comes with a 2' cable which is just right for my application  but a shorter or longer one could be used. For just a little more money I got great value.
5,I just use it as a transmitter to connect my Samsung TV to my Klipsch bluetooth speaker across the room. I previously was using a different brand which I thought had failed. As it turned out my speaker which appeared ready to accept pairing for some reason would not. It was not until I purchased this unit and could not get it to pair did I realize the problem was with my speaker. After resetting my speaker this unit found it and started playing immediately. Now at this point all I have to do is turn on this unit and it will then turn on my Klipsch speaker and start playing automatically. I have not noticed any lag.The unit is quite small and can be easily hidden if desired.
5,Works as described.
5,OK ...so... I got BLuTooth ear buds for Christmas but had no way of listening to my work computer.I searched and found this TROND™ device. I loved the compact and elegant design…and best of all it works great !  I can walk to the copier still listening to streaming radio. (~60ft)The customer service is really great as well a couple of days ago it stopped pairing.I couldn’t get it to pair rebooted several times and nothing. I found the email support@trond.comBruce a CSR got back to me right away explaining how to re-boot in RX mode to clear thePaired Devices and then boot in Tx and re-pair. It works again and I love it.You can leave it charging plugged in to the back of your computer and listen free of cords !
1,I've tried everything to get this item to work.  Even watched the videos trice.  Total Garbage!The Aisidra Bluetooth Transmitter Receiver is a much better product by far...
5,—This device is amazing and useful.  I have an old speaker which is non-Bluetooth.  The Trond enables me to stream music etc. from my IPhone to the speaker (I was about to deep six that speaker as I was using it so infrequently.).—Also I am using the Trond on my non-Bluetooth stereo my compact disc player and an old cassette player to transmit to my Bose  Bluetooth speaker.—At one point I couldn’t get the Trond to work.  The customer service was quick responsive and solved the problem—nothing was wrong with the device.—I have had the device for a fairly short period of time but as of this writing:  two very enthusiastic thumbs up; I am enjoying the device.
3,I paired with my Galaxy S7 Edge and played music via Google Play Music through bluetooth to my car's aux input jack. The sound quality was immediately noticeably poor. Muddy lows and no crisp highs. I compared to direct aux input to make sure it wasn't the phone or the songs I was playing. Compared to bluetooth on my other vehicles this has much poorer audio quality. 2 stars instead of 1 because the battery wasn't DOA and the pairing process was nice and easy.Edit 1/2019: TROND Customer Care contacted me and claimed the BT audio quality problems were due to a bad batch of receivers after some recent updates. They offered to send me an updated version for free but ultimately ended up sending me a different model. That model works perfectly with high quality sound (the BT-DUO S). Upgraded from 2 to 3 stars. Nice work TROND.
5,There was an issue with the original delivery which I brought to the attention of TROND's customer service. They were very prompt in addressing the issue. They explained the technical glitch and sent a replacement without any charge. The new one works superb awesome Customer Service and a great Product.
5,Great value because the unit can both receive from a separate source and transmit to a Bluetooth device.  Price point is excellent for its capabilities.
5,Pros: supports APT-X (only one on Amazon) which improves the sound quality that by nature bluetooth loses. Having it very support v4.1 along with legacy support is great. I recently purchased v4.1 headphones and also own a couple of older versions and they all paired within seconds. I have mine plugged into a TOS(shiba) link digital to analog adapter on my Samsung TV. With the TV market reducing it's variety of rear ports such as audio out this setup is becoming the norm feeding of the SPDIF digital port.I was blown away by the attention lead detailed packaging pure first class! These guys truly care.I did pair them to two sets of headphones with no problems whatsoever.I had a technical question and received an email response within thirty minutes!I'm obviously using mine in its transmitter mode as it does offer a receiver mode.Cons: none
5,EZ to connect.  I like the fact that can transmit OR receive.  Arrived quickly.
5,Some trouble connecting to my tozo buds but it worked out in the end
5,It seemed to work perfectly. I bought this for an LG TV that I didn't realize that it didn't have any Audio Outs until I was trying to get this to work. I only really used it to test it on a computer to make sure it was working right then I ended up giving it to family who could use it.
5,Finally after purchasing various products similar to this I can confirm this works with Airpods. I asked this very same question prior to making the purchase and they told me it should work so I went ahead and made the purchase. Took a while to connect but hey it works that's what matters.
5,I was experiencing the infamous "sounds like I'm listening to music in the bathroom" problem when using the bluetooth connection from my Dell laptop to my Hesh 3 headphones.  I found that I didn't have that problem when jacking into the headphone port with conventional 'phones so I tried hooking the Trond into the jack and then connecting to that with my Hesh 3 and poof the problem was gone.  Corded quality sound from a wireless connection.  So far I've found the battery lasts about 8 hours between chargings.
2,We bought two pairs of JLAB headsets to go with this blue tooth transmitter for two different tvs. We struggled to get both sets of headsets to connect or stay connected with both of the tvs. One would always get weakerand shut off. After reading the pamphlet it disclosed that this may happen if you didn't want this problem you'd have to buy their brand (Trond) headphones. The major problem with that is it doesn't seem like you can actually buy that brand of headphones anymore unless they're used. So I wouldn't recommend you buy this product if you want it to connect to more than one headset to watch with your spouse. It will stream well for onebut not two.
4,Works well with my Miccus 160ft LONG RANGE Transmitter/Receiver.  I wish this device would automatically turn on once power is sensed on the USB port.  Due to this limitation I could not use this device in my home automation setup to connect two different rooms' receivers.  1 star deducted.  Perhaps it mentioned this somewhere on the product description but even still.  That feature would make this a near perfect product.Instead I'll use this in my old model JVC Kaboom Box which lacks Bluetooth and isn't automated anyway.
5,Easy to use and functions as advertised.
4,I am very pleased with the Trond  BT-DUO Wireless transmitter & Receiver and it's working great with 3 of my blue tooth headphones. the sound is fine and it pairs with the headphones in about 20 seconds. It comes with a very good instruction manual which is very helpful. Also have a nice product warranty for 18 months &  a 30-day money back guarantee and customer support.
5,I love this bluetooth transmitter. Its fast and easy to set up. Set the switch to one of the 2 settings  (the manual will tell you which one) plug it in turn on your headphones to syncing mode and you're ready to go.  I use it while it's plugged into the wall but it also holds a charge so it doesn't need to be plugged in to a power source to use.
4,*Updating my previous review*Received a defective unit initially but contacted the company directly and quickly got a rep to help me get a replacement.The product fairly well. Range is decent; walked around my house with my LG bluetooth headphones and powerbeats headphones with no issues. Syncing is pretty straight forward. I did notice a slight (fractions of a second) delay in the audio however I've only been using the device for audio only so it doesn't bother me. I could see if someone would have issues with relying on the TV intended use and have the feeling of a badly dubbed movie/show.
5,I was searching for a bluetooth boombox because my Bose soundlink was not loud enough for the patio. While shopping in Amazon I took a chance and searched for a bluetooth receiver (that I did not know existed) and there it was. I purchased the TROND® 2 in 1 Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Audio and went straight to my Sony boombox (after charging it of course) and it was great! I don't have to connect the audio jack anymore and  have to stand next the boombox to change the music. I can now sit back and control everything with my phone. I plugged it in to my home stereo and my older vehicle and now enjoy wireless freedom of bluetooth. I recommend getting this unit  instead of purchasing all new audio systems for bluetooth connectivity. It will save you money.Thanks Trond!
5,Very neat little gadget. Easy to pair with my Bose head phones. I do get a slight lag with regular programing. When watching live TV the person speaking is slightly out of sync.  But for some reason if the show is on my DVR (which it usually is) there is zero lag.  Also when watching Netflix or Amazon Prime no lag.  The battery life if pretty darn good but I went ahead and just plugged this guy into my surge protector. That way i can leave it on all day.
4,Took a minute to get paired but it’s working now and sound good.
5,2011 Audi Q7.  I have an MMI-to-3. 5mm adapter. Plugged this lil baby in 2 seconds to pair with my phone and it's ready to roll.  Signal to noise ratio is 75dB which is very solid.  Apx codec provides excellent sound.Also I can plug my corded headphones into this and still listen to my tunes phone in my pocket headphone cord would up tight and out of the way.  Nice perk!  I am very happy with this purchase... And I am suuuper picky about my audio quality.Recommended!
3,This device would be great if it included a volume control. I use it primarily to transmit my TV audio to my Bluetooth speakers. The Bluetooth connection is independent of the TV volume control so there's no way for me to control the volume level on the speakers (the speakers don't have a volume control either). Also it pairs with my Bluetooth speakers okay (sometimes I have to make several attempts to pair successfully) but it's very hit-or-miss when trying to pair it with my Galaxy Buds (mostly miss).
4,This was so easy to set up and pair. I loved it....Then I noticedThe words were on a delay more than a bad Japanese Movie from the 1950s.The battery life is iffy After about 75 hours of use a charge last only about 6 hoursStill like it Sorta
5,The TROND Bluetooth Transmitter/Receiver worked very well right out of the box.  It paired immediately with my CANZ 808 Bluetooth Wireless Speaker.  Full instructions for using the TROND were included in the package in the form of a Welcome Guide.  I like to keep an electronic file of all my equipment user guides so I contacted TROND using the support email address included in the Welcome Guide to request a PDF version for my file.  I got a response the very next day with a link to the PDF.  Now that's what I call service!  I downloaded the PDF to my user guide folder which I keep on the computer desktop.  I look forward to a long service life for the TROND transmitter/receiver and it comes with a generous warranty.
5,I bought this to use on my bike to play my music from my phone through my stereo. So far it has worked well. It fits nicely in my bikes glove box and I'm able to plug it in there as well.
4,Bought these so I could watch in-flight entertainment on my international flight using my AirPods. They did just that. One of my aux male part snapped off with very little force (my baby snapped it) luckily it came with another one that worked out fine. Easy to sync with AirPods. Worked out great
3,Delivery was amazingly fast. Hook up and pairing fairly straightforward despite some apprehension as a result of a letter from the seller regardingpotential complexity in the process.  However I am a bit disappointed because of the very noticeable latency despite all the assurances that thisproduct has been upgraded with a newer feature (aptX Low Latency) which prompted me to purchase it in the first place.  I am using it while seated approximately 30-35 feet away on the other side of the room.  Will give it a few days and see if I can get used to the latency. I would imagine it would not be too much of a deal when listening through a headset or earbuds while the TV speakers are muted out.  Just wondering if I actually got the old stock by mistake.  The newer models were supposed to have replaced the old ones since May 8th.  Will update if warranted.
4,Merchandise arrived as promised. I could have given this a five stars but it takes a while to connect with the Bluetooth. It works great once I’m connected. I bought this to use on the flight since all my noise canceling headphones are wireless.
5,I don't usually review products I have purchased but this one deserves a great review.  I was skeptical before ordering but was happily surprised by the ease of the Bluetooth talking with my Yamaha AV receiver on my patio.  I am equally happy with the excellent sound quality.  I use this TROND to connect my Apple IPod (3rd gen) using the headphone jack. The only thing you should be aware of is that it comes with a dead battery and should charge for a couple of hours before any links can be attempted.  Otherwise I give this TROND high marks. You won't be sorry.
4,Pros : very Compact &  light weightCons :1.Latency is slightly noticeable but in acceptable range.2.Volume is too soft or quite low even it is fully charged.  I have to increase the volume of my DAP to almost max.
5,I got this so that my wife could practice playing her electronic keyboard with wireless headphones.  Got the headphones but then realized that the keyboard was not bluetooth.  Took a chance on the Trond transmitter not knowing if it would work with the keyboard and the headphones at all.  All I had to do was put the Trond into the headphones jack and the headphones found it immediately and the system was up and running!  It has not been  used enough to say how long the battery will last.  Still the Trond is a nice little device with lots of ways to use - very pleased!
4,Bought this item to test with an Alesis Command X Mesh Head Electronic Drum Set.The amount of lag between the unit head and a pair of JBL headsets is so distinct to say its not compatible in this environment.  Connectivity to a JBL headset is easy to pair.
5,Really had doubts about this as to trying to get it to work with two blue tooth headsets.  Wife and I both go walking to workout music which goes by the beat.  Both of us hear the same music from one phone with this transmitter and keeps us in sync without disturbing others since we usually Mall walk.  Size is pretty small and fits in the phones holster pretty well.  I could think of several other applications where this would be handy.  Pairing has to follow the directions exactly and takes a few minutes but not overly difficult.  Maintains pairing good when restarting each time.  If my wife has the need to sing along at least were listening to the same song.
5,works very well has bit of static however it is nearly unnoticeable. i move around a lot and my phones bluetooth cuts out when i bending or crouching. with this on my extended battery pack i never have that problem
4,Overall it works well for a transmitter haven't used it as a reciever. I use it for the old iPod classic which works well. Only thing it does seem to lose signal sometimes music goes in and out but just shut off whatever Bluetooth you are using usually it fixes it. But is worth the buy battery life is good been able to use it 10 hours now I do charge it when I can about 15 mins and haven't seen it show low battery signal.
4,Takes several seconds to connect with headphones (transmit mode) even if already paired--just need to wait (had much difficulty at first I think cause I was not waiting long enough).  Happy with it now I know how to use it.  Like that I can use any 3.5mm cable (in case it shorts out like the cable on the last BT transmitter I had but could replace cable).  Have not used receiver mode.  I use for radio so latency not an issue but seems to be responsive when changing radio volume).
4,Once I was able to install and operate this unit I was amazed by how well it performs.  I was not able initially to pair the unit as a transmitter between my TV and Bluetooth speaker.  I contacted the TROND support department with my problem using their email system.  I am happy to report that they responded to my problem within 24 hrs. with the information I needed to solve it.  I would give this product 5 stars if the packaged instructions had included those ultimately provided by the support department.
5,Edit: I’m changing my review from a 3 star to a 5 star. I love this product and my only gripe is that the first 2 crapped out on me and stopped working however the customer service is great. They replaced both and I’m on my 3rd one and it’s been working great for over a year now.Original Review:Excellent sound quality and great product however it stopped working on me. And I was sent a second one in which that stopped working on me as well.
5,Just received my 2nd TROND unit. The 1st I use on a Roku-3.streaming device. My wife retires early and I needed to turn down the sound on the TV. The 2nd unit will be connected to my computer so that I may do my research without having the sound turned up. The TROND is easy to use and pairs very fast with the 2 headsets I use.Battery life is acceptable but you must keep track of time used. The unit works so seamless it's easy to just forget it's there.I purchased mine through Amazon. I do lots of purchases at Amazon as they are easy to work with and as a Prime member delivery was supper fast.The TROND BT-DUO Wireless Transmitter & Receiver Is a good unit and well worth the price.
5,This unit is a replacement for the BTI-010 because the BTI unit was not meeting my needs.  I have only had the TRON for 3 days and so far it has preformed flawlessly.  I will down grade my rating of the TROND if it does not continue to perform well.  The main advantages of the TROND over the BTI is the sound quality is superior minimal latency ease of pairing and reliability of the connection.  For the small increase in price of this unit ($34.99 for the TROND vs. $22.56 for the BTI) it is well worth the improved benefits.  I wish I had known about the TROND before getting the BTI so hopefully this helps you not make the same mistake and waste money.
5,Super simple set up. The instructions aren't real clear as to charging the unit. But connectivity and use is very simple and straight forward. Use it to run music from my laptop inside of my house to speakers out in my garage while I am working.Beauty of the product is when switching on the Bluetooth automatically connects to the laptop and the music gets piped to the speakers. When I switch the unit off the music automatically switches back to the laptop.
1,Was not sure how to rate this product because not sure where the problem was.Would not connect with my Airpods from my TV. Pretty sure I had the transmitter connected correctly (the solid blue light was on that indicates pairing) but no sound through Airpods.  I have a Sony Android TV and called Sony them multiple times for suggestions. With third party products hard for them to really know where the problem lies but I was told by one of the agents that the product was not compatible with my TV.Unfortunately I was unable to get an opinion or advice from TROND despite multiple emails sent to them and no response.It is largely due to the poor customer support issue that I give the product a poor rating.Up date: TROND do get back with me. Bruce was very helpful  though after several email exchanges the solution to my problem not be found. The final diagnosis was the device was not compatible with my particular TV.
5,Trond is class act. Take amazing care of customers.  Forever grateful
3,Had it for a year always had issues connecting to my headset! Medium sound quality. And now the battery died and won't charge!
4,The set up was slightly confusing but it still only took 10 minutes. There's no visible sound delay syncing my Samsung TV with my Jambox. It's definitely a cheap way to get much better sound out of my TV so I'm pleased with it.The one drawback is the short USB charging cable. It doesn't reach far enough for any of the plugs near my TV so I keep having to remove it to charge it. I bought a longer micro USB charging cable and that should solve it.
5,Unfortunately with certain headphones the notification sounds transmitted through the audio device can be deafening at times. Some of my headphones transmit the notification sounds at a perfectly reasonable volume. So that definitely varies.With that said I love how easy to use light durable and efficient this product is. The battery life is exactly as advertised and i can use this product all through the work day. and if i forget to charge it? a quick 30 min charge and it's good for hours.Moreover and what i'm most impressed with is that i accidentally sent it through the washing machine in the pocket of some pants on the "heavy duty" setting and the TRON_BT-DUO still works! with no noticeable damage. Color me impressed.
5,I purchased 2 TROND BT-DUO's and a  TROND BT-DUO X .I pair the TROND BT-DUO X  which is attached to my media center and use the TROND BT-DUO's with my headset. They all pair easily and remember their connections so next time you only have to turn them on. No pairing required for subsequent uses.These have great audio quality and no noticeble delay due to their low latency system. Event the range is great I can move around get a rink or snack from the kitchen 30 feet away and still get clear audio.These are Great bluetooth Audio adapters
5,This is amazing tech.  If you own a set of Bluetooth headphones but have older devices like portable radios classic iPod etc. you can use them wirelessly with this device. I cut the grass listening to music or a ball game now without the hassle of wires which tend to get pulled out or snagged on something.  I just plug the TOND into the headphone jack of the iPod and turn it on.  I paired the TROND to my headphones put them into my pocket  and it just works.  Sound is crystal clear at that close range.  I haven't tried it at any distances so not sure of the extended range.  But for what I wanted to do it's perfect.
5,I got this for a smart Samsung tv one of the early generations and the instructions tell you to plug in the tv but it didn’t work that way for me .After using my brain I realize we’re the source or the sound comes in a tv basically connect it to your cable box the av white n red and your gold !!!It work like a charm !
2,I'm using this to receive bluetooth signal from my computer which is literally just 8' away. It works fine until the downstairs neighbors get home. I can usually hear it when they're speaking or watching TV but in this case I honestly can't which makes me think they're just using airpods around the house downstairs or something. The signal cuts out so much that it's impossible to listen to music.If you're in this kind of situation I'd advise skipping this product and just getting a longer cable.Ironically it may not have performed well well in tx mode either any time I got over 14' in the air above it. I used to use it for aerial dance in tandem with bluetooth headphones but those kept falling out. In this case the issue could have been the headphones though. Who knows.zREALLY REALLY GOOD SOUND QUALITY WHEN IT DOES WORK THOUGH!!! I'm just really frustrated I can't this device for what I need it for. I guess you get what you pay for.
5,This thing is fantastic.  I listen to music played through my computer while working throughout the day. Since the occasion often arises when I have to move away from my desk I was looking for a way to become untethered from the nuisance of constantly having to pause my music and remove my wired headphones. The TROND transmitter worked perfectly to solve my problem. After connecting the unit to my computer with the included cables placing the switch on the unit in transmit mode and pairing my bluetooth headphones I am free to move about approximately 30 to 50 feet untethered and still listening to my jams. Honestly I do not know why I did not make this purchase sooner!  Absolutely wonderful!
5,I bought this after initially purchasing another less expensive Bluetooth device from another seller that was incorrectly described in the product specifications and wouldn't connect with my Bose QuietControl 30 headphones.The TROND 2-in-1 on the other hand worked immediately and delivers great audio quality with imperceptible lag. Also unlike a Plantronics transmitter that I was replacing with the unnamed device and now the TROND the TROND doesn't require me to forget and re-pair the connection every time I power up the Bose headset -- it just works.I bought a couple of TROND LED desk lamps in the past and was impressed by their quality and features and this transmitter/receiver continues the very positive impression I have of the brand.
5,Like it prefect for my use.
5,The TROND device works with my AirPod earphone like a charm. Few seconds after I press the on/off button on the TROND a pairing is established with the AirPod. I use this device at the gym to listen to the audio of a TV channel. I can walk around and still able to hear the audio. No wires! The instructions were not clear about pairing with AirPods however Bruce at the customer office emailed me the directions in no time.I use the TROND for about an hour at the gym and the sound remains clear throughout. I use the device in the TX mode never tried the RX mode.
5,I recently got an iPhone 7 which no longer has a headphone jack. Knowing i was going to buy it i asked a tech friend of mine what my solutions were (my car only has aux audio) when playing music in the car. I got the BT Duo and it works amazing sound quality is awesome. THE ONE THING i will say is that some of the tracks i listened to were missing an instrument so i was worried it wasn't working properly--through the power of troubleshooting i found that it was the short aux cord that came with it that was faulty! Not a deal breaker most people have at least 1 aux cord to use if this happens just be aware :)
5,I bought this device to use in my Jayco RV stereo system since it is not equipped with Bluetooth.  Now using the RECEIVER MODE I can play music from my smartphone and not have to keep the phone wired up to the stereo.  The music streams without any interruption.  I love this device.  I have not yet used it in the TRANSMITTER MODE and do not know if I ever will but this is great if you need to transmit music or other sound from a smartphone to a non-Bluetooth component.  This device is about the size of a matchbook.  I have not tested out the battery duration yet.  I used it for only about 30 minutes and had no problems.
4,Great product and best-in-class customer service. Rating 5 stars if original unit worked. Customer service responded within 24 hours about DOA original item and shipped a new one within 2 days. Replacement arrived 3 days later. After just 2 hours for a full charge it sync'd immediately to my Arctic BT headphones without any noticeable AV delay (receiver headphone jack). Not sure if it's the Trond or the headphones but I'm getting about a 30' range line-of-sight and about 20' through walls. First impression: fidelity comparable to wired.
5,Works so good I bought another one.Make sure you get some BT 4.1 headphones(or speakers) to get the full benefit of the tech.All you have to do is press and hold until you see blue ring to power on. Then double tap to go into pairing mode.Once you pair in the future you just have to power on. Remember if your device (headphones etc...)  is paired to something else you will need to turn that device off if it is in range before you pair with any other BT device.If you are "receiving audio" through this device it is best to buy a dedicated set of headphones speakers etc... That way you don't have to worry about  connection conflicts with other devices.
5,I bought this to replace an MPOW TX/Rx Bluetooth dongle that took forever to sync up with our bluetooth-enabled speaker. The dongle is plugged into a mini-RCA headphone jack on our kitchen TV. This TROND unit syncs up almost instantly. Simple operation clear visual cues via LED activity decent sound good battery life fast on recharge. Can't ask for much more.
4,You are correct when you say these devices are a bit more complicated than most plug-and-play devices. I'm pretty tech savvy and it took me many tries before I got the TROND to pair with my ilive bluetooth speakers but I finally did. Sometimes it takes a couple tries to get them to connect but eventually they do. Signal strength is an issue too so you have to keep speakers and the TROND charged up. All in all I really like the product.
4,I like this little monster!! Packs a punch with sound as it can get really loud. I use it in my car and the sound is perfect. I’m not a fan of the quick batter life as now i just leave the charger on so that it’s charging and being used at the same time. Good purchase overall.
5,Get your it work fine the best i've got
3,Doesn't always connect smoothly with my earphones. :-(  Most annoying is that I have to turn up the volume all the way on my ipod just so my wireless earphones can pick up the sound. The signal from the ipod is just too weak and the TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth does not have amplification so I can barely hear my ipod.  I also plugged into my Stereo receiver using a quarter inch jack connector with mini in. I can hear my receiver just fine - excellent quality but a slight delay so I have to turn the TV sound when I'm listening to television through the stereo amplifier. Not worth for the ipod but since I have some hearing loss well worth it for listening to TV through my stereo amp...
5,This product does exactly what I wanted it to. I use it mostly for my switch to connect to my home speaker system and haven't really had any problems.Decent battery life nothing too crazy.The only problem I guess would be pairing it to multiple devices. It can be hard to get it to pair with the device you want it to in that case since it only has the flashing light as feedback.
5,This little device is awesome.  I bought it to transmit my onkyo receiver sound (specifically cable TV sound) to my JBL reflect bluetooth sports in-ear headphones.  I wanted to have the sound go directly to my ears so I didn't have to turn the sound system speaker volume up so loud when I was using an elliptical exercise machine.  When i ordered it I was worried that the sound would be delayed or have jitter because my headphones aren't aptx compatible but I don't have any problems at all.  It works exactly as I hoped.  The device paired quickly and easily with my headphones.  I couldn't ask for more.  Great buy.
5,The perfect solution for using wireless headphones at the gym! Cardio equipment typically has a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack which meant I couldn't use my wireless AirPods -- I had to carry around a set of wired earbuds just for this purpose.now I just need to bring this transmitter to the gym and plug it in to their equipment. I purchased a male/male coupler (see picture) to keep things compact. They are less than $5 and help keep things simple.I've been using it for a week and have had no connection problems. There is no noticeable lag while watching the gym TV's. I haven't tested battery life since I've recharged after each 90 minute use.
3,Can’t connect my AirPods to this device at all.
5,I’ve not been able to pair with my Jabra Elite 65T Earbuds through either the Headphone or Stereo (Red/Whie inputs on the side of my TV..Update: I went into my Fire stick Audio output settings  and found that it was set to Digital so I unchecked the box putting it into a Stereo Mode.. as well as checking my Apple Box Audio output was set to Auto..After doing this I had no problem syncing the Trond Transmitter with my Jabra Earbuds and with no lip sync issues..Problem Solved...Excellent Product!
5,Great product allowing for great sound. I bought two of these to use with my tv and wired headphones. I planned on using one unit as a transmitter and the other as a receiver. This however created an issue as the sound would fade in and out. I reached out to the Trond's customer service who assisted me in troubleshooting the issue over the email. We went back and forth for a couple of days and they eventually sent me a receiver   TROND 3.5mm Bluetooth V4.2 Audio Receiver Adapter with AptX Low Latency & Volume Control for Home Stereo Wired Headphones & Speakers         to test with. This resolved the issue so I'm going to keep it working this way.
5,Sound quality good. Bluetooth connectivity with my LG tv and Denon receiver was tricky but Geek Squad was able to figure it out and now I can listen hone theater thru my wireless headphones.
4,Works great for wirelessly sending an audio signal from my house to my garage a distance of approximately 35 feet. Setup is a bit more cumbersome than I'd like; I use two (one in receive mode one in send mode) and it seems like I have to re-pair them every time I use them. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but even if I'm not I'm still mostly happy- this is a good value and beats than the hassle of running wires.
5,I have been searching for something that allows me to stream the audio from my turntable (through the receiver) to a Bluetooth speaker for use in another room. This was easy to set up and works well. The one caveat is that the sound latency is significant. If using it like me where you're only using the blur tooth speaker you're good. If you hope to use both the direct speakers and to add on the Bluetooth speaker the latency is too long to effectively use both speakers at once. (The audio is out of sync by a few seconds)
5,I bought this transceiver because my TASCAM DR-40 recorder doesn't have Bluetooth built in.  I wanted to record my barbershop quartet and then play back the recording so we can improve our sound.  Playback is through a Harmon Kardon Onyx Studio Bluetooth speaker.  It all works just as I wanted it to.  I just needed to set the transceiver to transmit then press the Bluetooth button on the speaker and they paired up with no problem.  Now I have the good quality recordings playing back through the good speaker system.  It's working well for us too.  We did a song as part of a show this weekend and got really good comments on our sound.
5,I bought a TROND® Bluetooth V4.1 Low Latency Transceiver to connect to my parent's television to use with Avantree Audition Pro - Low Latency Headphones.  This allows my Dad to watch TV listening at a volume level adequate for him while allowing the TV volume to be turned down to a level that my Mom is comfortable with..The TROND® Transceiver works well with the Audition Pro Headphones and the combination sound really good.  Since the Transceiver stays plugged into a USB charger at the back of the TV I can't comment on the Battery Life..I also bought two of the TROND® Transceivers for myself to experiment with - but I haven't had the opportunity to connect and check them out.
5,I was a little nervous at the beginning because my wireless headphones don't have a screen nor does this appliance so I thought bluetoothing them together was not going to happen after I saw what I ordered but I'm grateful that it connects quite easily with my earbuds.  I flew the other day and couldn't get them to sinc not sure why but that was really the only problem I have had with this device.
5,Little low-cost exceptional tool that enabled me to turn my 1970s era turntable and amplifier into a wireless system.  Also use it for a CD player but it's fantastic to listen to old LPs through digital earphones thanks to the TROND Bluetooth transceiver.  I did have to buy a PYLE PLVHL60 2 Channel Speaker to RCA Converter that converted my amp's speaker wire output to RCA plugs but it worked great with the TROND product as well.  I'm using a cheap $20  pair of BT earphones so whole solution cost less than $75.  But I'm thinking about getting more expensive headphones now I know the concept works.  Highly recommend TROND as it works flawlessly with periodic recharges.
5,The TROND Wireless transmitter and receiver - BT-Duo is an excellent bluetooth transmitter/receiver that turns any non bluetooth device into a bluetooth compatible device.  As a transmitter it works well with E-readers cellphones or other digital devices and makes them compatible with bluetooth headsets.  I have used the device for 6 weeks and found it to be excellent.  The battery life is more than a day of use with high fidelity quality and total stability.  It is small and light.  My only complaint is that the pairing light and sequence for pairing is not as easy as it might be--especially if one has a visual impairment.  Once paired it performs flawlessly.
5,I primarily used this when traveling on an airplane with my AirPods. It worked great to transfer the movie audio from rear seat entertainment systems to my AirPods.Now with the stay-at-home order I am using them as a receiver for my regular headphones from my television. I have bluetooth headphones at home too but they get heavy on the head (gave my mom my AirPods).Great device to have.
5,For people buying this for musical instruments I can confirm it works well with my AptX low latency earphones on my piano and electric guitar. No discernible lag so I can practice music through bluetooth with no issues. Very small/compact so easily portable between the instruments. Very happy with this item.
5,We bought this to incorporate our old turntable into our new bluetooth sound bar set up.  Getting this transmitter hooked up is a breeze.  It comes with the 1/8" connectors as well as red and white audio cables.  We have had no problems with the signal strength.
5,I am using this product since 6 months .It is very excellent product and easy to use .I mainly use it as Bluetooth transmitter in which I  connected it to  my 55" LG OLEDTV and wireless headphone .Pros:-Turning on and off is a one click - real time transmission- very small size- can be used while charging- clear and well balanced sound qualityCons :- very short audio cable ( around 10 cm )Conclusion:Very excellent product and highly recommended to those football fans who want to enjoy football matches without annoying his/her familyThank  you and best regards
3,Does not work the way I wanted to use it. I hooked up to my TV so I could hear it across the room. Could not hook it up without additional adapters .  Still can't connect my headphones to it.
4,This very small item will give you about 8 hrs before needing to be charged.  The customer service is excellent and resolved my issue quickly
5,It works range is better than any other one I had (still it's BT so don't expect to be able to walk around the whole house) and is a transceiver (you can set receive or send i.e. use it on your stereo to send the signal to your BT headphones or use it to receive audio to your wired headphones from i.e. your laptop)The sound quality isn't that good tbh but that might just be the BT and atx standards and how Windows negotiates the bandwidth. Latency when watching movies is basically 0 thanks to the new protocols)
5,I have never done a product review before. I have an iPhone 7 that does not have a head phone jack. I have wired  head phones and earbuds. I don't like the lightening adaptor that came with the phone especially since I can't charge my phone while using it. I decided to buy this very small device.  This very small device is amazing.  Easy to pair and works great. It lasts a long time on a charge. I have a couple of other applications and will buy a couple of more. If you need one you can't go wrong with buying this item.
4,I have it connected to a projector and while it seamlessly beams excellent quality sound to the speakers it's also quiet.Unfortunately this is not my end-all solution I'm still looking...
5,I purchased this item for use teaching a class where I have to use my phone for media. It is very effective.
5,Just what we needed! My son purchased blue tooth enabled Bose headphones and wanted to use them with his desktop as well as his phone. This little gadget does the job perfectly! Thank you.
5,The product is working very well.  I have had to do one reset on the unit - for whatever reason - but it is now working fine.  My speaker has both blue tooth and "RCA Jacks" for hookup.  The noticeable delay when using Bluetooth to the speaker from the TV is understandable when dealing with different codecs.  I now use the RCA inputs for the speaker and TV to watch programs.  I have a second speaker which I connect to the TV by blue tooth for music.  It works just fine.
5,I really like the TROND 2-in1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter/Receiver.  It was smaller than I thought it would be about the size of a matchbook.  It paired effortlessly with my Bluetooth headset.  I have had trouble in the past pairing various other Bluetooth devices but this was super easy.  I bought this to use in a bedroom while on my treadmill watching TV.  I have only had the device for about a month.  I could not detect any sound latency and the sound was great.  The only complaint I have is the USB cable is not very long only about 12 inches or so.  No big deal.
5,I've only had this for a month but own two of them.  I've used it to send stereo sound from an Android tablet I use as a DJ audio player to a mixing board.  When the music is done being mixed I've sent it out through one of these on broadcast mode to bluetooth enable speakers.  I've also used this while paired with a phone which plays music in my car.  It has only been a month so I can't speak to durability and it really doesn't seem like it would be durable but who cares about how it seems.  It's very much worth the money so far.
5,I used this to send sound from a powered mixer to a set of bluetooth bookshelf speakers which I purchased.  The ownrer of the restaurant where I work want to be able to bring the sound of my performance to an adjoining room.  Setup was super simple.  I turned it on - set it to pair. and did the same with the speakers.  I had them working immediately receiving sound from my mixer.  Great product.  And the audio is clear with no sign of degradation.  I am one happy customer.
5,* Small and well made It very small and light weight but looks high quality* Easy to pair I use this on my desktop to pair with Bluetooth headphone just power on the blue light flashing to indicate ready to pair then turn on headphone to pair and paired in second the light turn stable blue.* Multiple functions  - Use it on Desktop old laptop or TV to connect Bluetooth headphone speakers[Switch to TX]  - Use it on wire headphone or studio system upgrade to Bluetooth with in a budget[Switch to RX]I very satisfy with this purchase and definitely recommend.
5,Great little device. Good sound. I had very little trouble pairing with my AirPods. Did not pair with my older Bose Soundsport Wireless Headphones but that is not a surprise. I can't get them to pair with my laptop either.
2,I FINALLY got it to pair to my Air Pods - I think it was more user error but I had to have both buds in their spot and press the button and it worked. I liked how small it was but it was REALLY quiet and I couldn’t adjust the volume so I returned it. I just went with the Fire Stick we already had in the house and paired my Air Pods to that. I then added the Air Screen app. So now I can mirror my iPad AND control the volume.
4,Fair product; timely delivery.
5,Works very well.  Bought to pair older Bose Radio which I feed tv audio to with blue tooth headphones so I can watch TV and not keep others awake due to loud sounds ( I work off shift often).  Wife also practices piano in same room can listen to tv or radio and not disturb her.  Delighted by sound quality I keep powered thru USB cable when tv is on.  No battery life or significant pairing issues
3,What convenience (sarcasm). It pairs with headphones one day. It loses pairing the next day.  You have to keep re-pairing each time you want to use it. What a hassle. This is the third Bluetooth transmitter I've tried. I'm going to have to go back to my turtle beach rf headphones.EDIT: Update. Trond customer service reached out to me the day after my review and tried to help. From what I understand the transmitter needs to stay powered on. I had it plugged into the TV's USB and it loses power every time the TV turns off. I would need another power strip to have an open outlet for powering it. Trond issued a refund the next day. I changed my review from 2 stars to 3 (It's okay).
2,Too pricey
4,Took a while to pair: you have to turn it off/on to get it to scan and you need patience. The audio cable is a little short. Otherwise it works fine.
3,Well this device has potential to be amazing but for me it's definitely not. When I have this hooked up to my TV or my computer there's a large and noticeable delay. I could have researched that more but it's the type of thing that you don't realize you need to check first when you've never had a device like this before. So I feel like I wasted my money on this since I do not use it any longer.EDIT: The manufacturer refunded my order so that was super nice of them. I added a star for great customer service. Thanks Trond!
5,I purchased this bluetooth transmitter so that I can watch TV in my bedroom with my wireleass earbuds.  The Trond is connected to the audio out (red/white) jack on the back of my TV using the adapter that was included.  My wireless earbuds paired without any difficulty and I was able to watch TV without disturbing my wife within just a few minutes.  I will be getting another Trond for our family room TV.
5,Enough said it works. I was going to buy the one offered at the Apple Store. This was a cheaper alternative and it actually works just as good. Just not sure how long it will last me.
4,This is very great! Small size and good reception. I loved this.I was thinking only to use this on my device with no bluetooth and connect this to my earphone now even when I am listening to my phone and ipad with aux output I still use this and the bluetooth so my head's movement is not limited by the length of the cord.
5,Prior to buying this bluetooth transmitter l did extensive research of other similar transmitters on Amazon's website and chose this Trond transmitter due to all of the other excellent reviews from prior customers who purchased this same item.I must say l am not disappointed!!! It was very easy and simple to connect to my wireless headphones. I would highly recommend this transmitter to anyone looking for a an inexpensive and simple solution for most any bluetooth connectivity issue.
5,Like:-Highly portable-Great battery life-Easy setup-It comes in a fancy box. It's kinda neat.Dislike:-It's way too small. I feel like I could lose it easily-No volume controls-Annoying loud and sudden "low battery" sound when battery is low.-The box it comes in is like way too fancy. I mean it's just a Bluetooth thing. Chill.Recommendation:If you need to transmit or receive sound via the Bluetooth 4.1 protocol you should probably get this device. If you lose small things quite often you should not get this device. Also don't get this device if you get annoyed by annoying loud and unexpected sounds.
4,Product works very well with my Vizio TV.  The model I purchased does not have an audio volume control.  Unlike some others I would like to turn the volume down but cannot do so.  If I had to do over again I would spend the money to be able to adjust volume
5,I thought I had a problem @ 1st because the unit was not charging correctly. I got in touch with Bruce and he said it might be the cable. What really happened was that by mistake I switched cables between the new headphones and the Trond Unit so I reversed the cables and the unit charged correctly. Just make sure you use the charging cable that came with unit. Very happy using it on a 1976 Nikko Reveicer.
5,My mom bought my son bluetooth headphones for an early Christmas present.  We didn't realize he would need an additional item in order to pair them.  Three items later this was the only one that worked!  Works great happy kid!  The headphones are Arctis 3 Bluetooth easy simple pairing process!  His goal was to be able to leave the switch docked and play so we use it in the audio jack.
4,My wife and I use this device in Tx at the gym so we can follow the same online workout while not blasting it to disturb other people. I have a monster bluetooth headset and my wife has another brand. Her unit hooks up every time mine is a little hit and miss but usually catches on the first or second try. It works well for us but is limited a little bit by how much we can individually adjust the volume.
5,I have the new iPhone where the headphones connect to the same spot as the charger.  I tried several different things to try to be able to listen to my podcasts in my car while still charging my phone and this was the only thing that solved my problem.  None of the splitters/adapters worked in my car even though they would work fine with regular headphones.  I didn't even know this existed until I saw it on prime day and decided to give it a try and boy am I glad I did.
5,Needed a transmitter for my digital audio player for use with a Bluetooth speaker. This transmitter was very easy to set up and link and works fine.  Very small too.  Less than the size of an old fashioned book of matches.
4,Received item on schedule seller was great to deal with. I received a follow up email regarding the transmitter I purchased. The Transmitter works great I use it with my TV and I can hear the TV bothering anyone else and no wires. You can also plug it into any USB on your TV cable box or what ever USB close and it will stay charged so no need to remove to charge it.
5,This review is for a TROND Bluetooth V5.0 Transmitter Receiver for TV PC iPod 2-in-1 Wireless 3.5mm Adapter. i'm using this to be able to connect bluetooth headphones with a TV that does not have bluetooth capability. I just got this so not much 'run time' using it yet but it's easy to set up and performs well so far. I'm happy with it.Item was packaged well and arrived on time.
2,It did not meet my needs.  Connectivity issues with static with my speakers.
5,This was working as expected. It came with RCA audio / 3.5mm cable + 3.5mm male to male adaptor so I didn't have to worry about converting interfaces. I'm using it to pair my wireless bluetooth headset to the TV especially when watching movies with profanity (so kids can't hear it).  Although it's set-and-forget for me those who are planning to carry it for travels would find it compact and of good build.  I can't complain on the bluetooth range - audio drops off only when I'm behind something so I blame that on my furniture and walls not the device.
2,Worked great right out if the box but after 30 days the Bluetooth would not stay connected over 30 minutes.  Very strange and very unacceptable.
5,I have an old Microsoft Zune that does not have Bluetooth built-in.  This device allows me to connect my Zune to any Bluetooth speaker or device!  Love it!
5,I have a TV with headphone out but no Bluetooth and I wanted to use a Bluetooth speaker by the bed. I used 3M double sided tape to attach this unit to the TV plugged it in to the headphone jack and plugged the charging port in to one of the TV's USB ports to keep it charged following the simple instructions it immediately pared with my Bluetooth speaker and works flawlessly ongoing. great little device.
2,I've been loving this mini transmitter/receiver for a while. I traveled with it everywhere for a while when I was using wired earphone and I mostly used it as a receiver. Now I'm upgraded most of my headphones wireless so I decided that I should use it as a transmitter now. However just recently I realized it's never worked as transmitter successfully. Maybe I didn't realize it came as a defect and didn't find out until now. I tried everything the instruction says as I should turn on TX mode before turning it on and such. But so far zero success. It parries without a problem but I can't hear anything. (I tested with my computer Nintendo switch and TV) Otherwise I love this little thing so much. Bummer.
4,Small and sweet.  Does exactly what it says it will do.  Only wish that it would automatically reconnect on external power up with paired devices - you have to press the single power/start button to reconnect with a linked device.  Otherwise it is a great addition to my car and and I also plan to use it to link to a Bose radio.
3,It works but you can tell it is cheap.  Getting it to charge and work at the same time is random.  My iPhone and Windows phones connected just fine to it but the device randomly wont start back up.My setup is I have a Volvo XC60 and this device is intended to stay 100% in center console.  I expect it to auto power on (it does not) when the USB port provides power and auto connect to available Bluetooth devices (it doesn't).  When I power car off and walk away I expect it to shutdown after a few min of not having a paired device connected (it sometimes does).I don't love it nor do I hate it.
4,It's pretty good but doesn't work for my purpose.  I wanted to add a speak to the back of my living room to get more coverage.  Unfortunately there is a noticeable delay in sound with the TV sound.  This would work great if its only music.  But since I need to be in sync with the TV audio and video it doesn't really work for me.  If they could eliminate the delay I'd give it 5 stars.
3,Works well but always has a buzzing sound
5,My old school shelf stereo system has nice speakers but is way too old for bluetooth.  But it does have an aux line-in jack.  The TROND gizmo plugs into that and receives bluetooth signal from my phone so I can listen to music over my nice speakers without having to leave the phone directly attached to the stereo with a long audio cable.  It works just great for this purpose. I have not tried to use it for video so I don't know if there's a lag. It's very responsive with music. I had no trouble with the pairing/charging directions from the vendor.
5,I had no problem getting it to work. I plugged it in to my stereo receiver’s headphone jack  and paired it to my flip 4 speaker in no time. I also plug it into my Sony boom box’s aux line in and sent a signal from my iPad. It worked both ways as a transmitter and as a receiver. A nice addition to your accessory package would be a 1/4” phono to a 1/8” phono jack adaptor just saying.
5,From what I understand  the speaker device has to have APTX LOW LATENCY however Soundcore 2 does not have that.  Regardless  I am using this device plugged into the" headset audio out" on my Panasonic Viera TV and there is no lag at all from the TV to the wireless SoundCore 2 speaker.
4,We could not get this to work with our older blueray player to Projector.  We knew before we ordered it that this probably wouldn't work but wanted to try anyway.  Great product however!  Wish we had a use for it.
4,I use it to send sound to a speaker beside my recliner because of a hearing problem.  From cable box to speaker.  First unit would only work a couple hours and would not work while plugged into a separate charger.  Trond was excellent when I contacted them.  They sent replacement and all is well.
5,Everything works as advertised. Sound quality is very neutral which is good.The real secret weapon of this product is the packaged accessories. It has every possible plugs and cables you can think of to make your situation work. They aren't even common accessories; something you'd only find in RadioShack if they still existed.If I have to purchase more Bluetooth transmitters in the future I'll definitely give TROND a serious consideration.
5,This company deserves some props for an excellent product and service.  The day before it arrived I received an email from them describing how to hook it up in great detail with an email address and phone number for a customer service rep who could help if I need it.  But I didn't.  It took me less than 5 minutes to plug it in to the back of my DirecTV box and sync it to my Oontz Angle bluetooth speaker (which recognized it immediately).  No hassle no problems.  Well done and thank you TROND I'll get my money's worth out of this purchase for sure.
5,This is what I was looking for I tried other cheaper units that were knock off brands they did not work. This one however works great with no latency or lag. I hooked it up to my tv thru the headphone jack and it shoots the audio to my Bluetooth speakers. Works great and sounds great !!
3,An inexpensive bluetooth transmitter that I bought for listening to music at work from my computer (which doesn't have bluetooth) to wireless headphones (Plantronics BackBeat Sense). I like the price the small size and styling and it works. Having two wires from the computer to the tiny unit is a bit untidy (USB for charging and 3.5 mm audio for sound) but maybe unavoidable. Pairing was fine although I found the connection a bit slow and would drop after the headphones went into pause mode (when you take them off); I have to push the pair button on the Trond to manually reconnect; I don't have this problem when I listen to my phone.
5,Works great with old iPod Shuffle generation 2 wireless sport earbuds!  There is no latency and it was super easy to sync which surprised me.  It is so light and small that I hardly noticed an additional piece of equipment during my run.I also paired it with my hybrid piano..hmm latency was obvious but it worked if you played a very slow piece!I am just happy that I could reuse my iPod Shuffle wit my wireless earbuds.  .
3,This is a great device and I would get this over any other Bluetooth receiver for my Switch. The thing with it is that audio will lag when connecting Bluetooth speakers which would be fine for music because your not watching someone's mouth move just a little jarring for games. Next for this device every time I turn it on and go to connect headset I have to put it in pairing mode then put this device back in pairing mode rather then the device connecting to the headset automatically.
5,The unit has worked as advertised. I turn on my bluetooth speaker first and start the pairing process and then turn on the unit and it automatically connects every time. This after I went through the pairing process on the unit the first time. The unit remembers what I have connected to it. I would recommend.
5,I use the Trond BT-DUO to listen  to TV and music on my Trond TD-BH01 low latency headphones.  The sound quality is just right and the pairing is simple and easy.  Bruce in customer service responded to my questions quickly with good advice and in my opinion went beyond my expectations.  I highly recommend these Trond units for their quality dependability and outstanding customer service after the sale.
5,It transmits or receives. Sound quality and APTX Low Latency of the TROND BT-DUO coupled with TROND Bluetooth V4.2 Headphones makes TV watching a joy. You can use it in your car or connect it to your stereo's input to enjoy wireless sound from your phone's Blu-tooth.  I recommend the TROND BT-DUO as well as all TROND products.Also TROND Customer Service is the best there is. Bar none!
5,Just got a pair of noise cancelling Apple AirPod pro ear buds and was taking a 10hr international flight. Since the ear buds do not have a provision for directly connecting to the 3.5mm plug i bought the Trond V5.0 blutooth transmitter. It was very simple to hook up and pair with the AirPods and worked like a champ. BTW the AiPod active noise cancellation is amazing.
5,Works well. Higher volume can distort a little (probably the earphone rather than transmitter?). Pairing is easy. The range is about 30'. If earphone is paired to my phone also I have to turn phone bluetooth off a single device can't be paired to more than one Bluetooth signal at a time.
5,I have a Vizio Smart TV that did not come with  Bluetooth. I purchased the Trond Bluetooth 4.1 transmitter / receiver and following the accompanying instructions exactly linked it with  my Bluetooth earphones in about 5 to 10 seconds. Yes. That fast ! I have 4-sets of earphones each from differing companies and ranging in version of Bluetooth from 3.0 to 4.1  with names like Phaiser Mpow  Captain and Trond and ALL link perfectly. Just follow the instructions provided unlink your earphones from a prior source and re-link to the Trond transmitter / receiver. I now watch late night TV without waking the household.
5,I pair the Trond 2-in-1 with my Phaiser waterproof wireless headset (also found on Amazon). Incredibly awesome sound especially when tweaking the EQ on the ipod. Great for the classic ipod. Use a 3M Command refill strip to attach the very small Trond  unit to the back of the ipod; no dangling.  It has great range too; easily 25 ft. though microwaves tend to disrupt all bluetooth signals.  I also use it to listen to the TV without disturbing others by plugging it into the headphone jack. It also has the latest Bluetooth V4.1. I would highly recommend this unit. You won't be disappointed!
5,I paired  the TROND BT-DUO Bluetooth T/R to a QCY50 headphone to listen to movies on my DVD player. I did notice some latency but after awhile your brain seems to ignore it and the latency disappears. Pairing is easy and after the initial pairing it is automatic. I turn on the BT-DUO first and then the headset and in a few seconds they are paired. I found that the BT-DUO can be left connected to the charge line. When fully charged it will turn itself off. I have not tried to pair two devices but will probably in the future. The instructions are good and shipping was on-time.
5,Actually I received a malfunctioning BT-DUO. They said that there was some kind of software bugs while updating from Bluetooth V4.1 to V5.0 but it's fixed problem now. I reported the problem to TROND official and they tried to replace the device. However due to my address (South Korea) amazon could not issue a replacement so they just sent me another BT -DUO S for free!!! I really appreciated for their kind reply and service. (And BT-DUO S was perfect! Great sound!) Once again thanks for TROND's great service.
5,I bought two of these to replace another brand which was in comparison much more finicky.  These units connect very quickly stay connected on battery when wall power is connected or removed.  If the connection is lost to a speaker it is restored quickly if the speaker is power-cycled.The sound is clear and the time lag is noticeable but not too annoying.The initial pairing process works smoothly.  The light display on the unit (off/on connecting/connected/pairing) makes sense.All in all I am very happy with these they are in use 24/7 have been working flawlessly for a month now.
4,Bought these so I could use my bluetooth headphones on a long flight. They connected easily and the battery life was good. Only issue is the audio cable it comes with is pretty crappy and I had to twist it around to get a good connection on more than one location but other than that it was great!
5,Reliable little gadget that does what it says. It pairs easily and quickly with other devices. I tested the transmitter function and connected it with my bluetooth headphone and bluetooth speaker. It connected to them easily and streamed the audio. The receiver mode also works as expected. The reason I bought this however is for gaming with bluetooth headphone. This device supports apt-x low latency that minimizes the audio lag. To fully take advantage of this feature your other device (headphone in my case) should also support apt-x low latency otherwise TROND will fall back to other codecs.
5,Actually better than I expected. I use it with my AirPods Pro.  Great quality easy to charge and use at the same time since I was on a 13+ hour flight. I’ve used it a few times there was only one time for some reason the plane’s jack wasn’t compatible it fit the plug but it just didn’t work. Still a good product sound is good and easy to use.
3,First I have to say this product seems to work well. The poor rating come from the design. The receiver/transmitter would be much better if it had a better mini plug one that is permanently attached to the device or could be extended from the body of the device. The battery is also not very long lasting as I could only get about half the time of use the seller claims. Didn’t really get a chance to try it out until after the return window closed so I guess I must keep it now! There must be a better one out there someplace... just have to keep searching!
1,I bought this product specifically for the Nintendo switch because they had pictures of the device being used on the switch in their description and other customers left reviews saying they used it on their switch. THIS DEVICE DOES NOT WORK FOR VOICE. Apparently other people don’t care about talking to teammates on voice chat but I most certainly do. I would not have bought this product if they had been forthcoming about not working for voice and honestly in the year 2019 who doesn’t want their headset to work with voice chat?After the product didn’t work the way I wanted it to I got a new phone and decided not to send it back because my van doesn’t have Bluetooth and my new phone doesn’t have a headphone jack so I thought it would be ok for listening to music in my van. When it works it works well however it never connects to my phone on its own.. 90% of the time I have to have my phone forget the device and reconnect to it before it will connect. There is also no warning before it’s battery gets low and it just dies.. I have $5 Bluetooth earbuds that give me a warning beep and also display a battery bar on whatever device it’s connected to.. I would advise anyone to not waste your time with this hunk of crap.
1,I was able to successfully pair this to my bluetooth headset but the audio quality is really poor. I tried the device with known properly working audio outputs such as my laptop an digital audio recorder and my DSLR camera. Even with everything set at maximum volume the sound is barely audible through my bluetooth headsets. I triple checked everything and reread the user manual but this device is not usable. The latency that other users complain about is there and that would be a drawback but the audio is so low I can't even worry about the latency. This is truly wasted money.
5,A little bit tricky to first set up because it is too simple compared to many on the market and does it give out wonderful sound. I don't know what kind of gear these folks that are griping about the too much base are using but I have both Bludio others and my latest Avantree and they ALL improved with this remarkable Bluetooth. Range from transmitting behind a 70 inch HDTV is about 30 ft not bad with metal stud walls throughout the house. I LOVE the instant connect feature where I don't have to reconnect every time I use them. Excellent wonderful not over priced.
3,Used this with the TROND Bluetooth receiver   TROND 3.5mm Bluetooth V4.2 Audio Receiver Adapter with AptX Low Latency & Volume Control for Home Stereo Wired Headphones & Speakers         plugged into a speaker and despite the promise on the product description unfortunately the audio lags significantly behind video on the screen. Very disappointing. Good customer service from TROND though - they tried to do everything they could to find out what the problem was and they have a month money-back guarantee which I took advantage of to return both products. So good company but the product didn't really do what I wanted it to. I think Bluetooth still isn't up to scratch for non-perceptible time lag.
5,So I just received this product about two hours ago. It took me less than five minutes to install. Even after reading other reviews it is much smaller than I thought it was.  I connected it directly to the back of my cable box with the included mini to RCA cable. I also connected the USB cable to the back of my cable box as well. I tested it on several different TV channels  both HD and regular. There is no noticeable lag between people speaking and hearing on the headphones. I am using a pair of Bose Bluetooth headphones and it's great.
5,This is a neat product. I bought it for my Nintendo Switch so that I could play it with Bluetooth headphones but instead I hooked this up to my TV and just Bluetooth enabled the entire TV. Pairing seemed odd without any sort of screen on the device or on my headphones but not too bad to figure out. Now I can watch anything on the TV with my Bluetooth headphones - like late night Netflix binges or playing my Switch without the sound bothering my family. Pretty cool!
4,It works well as a transmitter for TV. I'm an rank amateur and I needed ALOT of help to figure out how to make all the connections to my cable box and how to get stereo reception. The guys from Etrond were helpful and very responsive in helping me figure it out. I also had to make a trip to Radio Shack to get the proper adapters and wires for connecting to my cable box.
4,using this on an older/not so smart tv. now i can enjoy my movies and not disturb everyone. would have given it a 5 but the instructions weren't clear and it took a bit of frustration to get it to work but since i've hooked up multiple tv's and headsets with no issue just a learning curve
5,Easy to pair and works fine the user (my wife) is happy - starting to save to buy one for me....
4,For my use of trying to make a surround sound bar for my T.V. the latency was too bad for it to work.For use in your car I guess if your phone doesn't have bluetooth i'm sure it would work fine.The sound quality was good it just lagged behind the picture and the other speakers.
5,All around excellent product. A couple simple steps pairs this device with nearly anything and the range and performance are great. And battery life is great especially considering it’s small size.  Nearly postage stamp size makes it great for travel. I use it to connect Bluetooth headsets to in flight entertainment systems. Makes a big difference on flights to not be tied to headphone cords. Also I had a minor troubleshooting issue and emailed their customer service and had a tailored reply within an hour that addresses my issue.
2,Like using them on the plane but the sound is a little quiet even when fully turned up and the device doesn't stay paired to your Bluetooth headphones. Once you turn it off you have to spend a good 15-20 minutes trying to pair it to your headphones again.
4,I use this product as a receiver so I can play music from my phone to my stereo system & speakers. It works great. I wish that it came with a remote control though so I could turn it off from across the room.  I also wish that the charge lasted longer.
3,Wanted to use this to avoid wires while watching a movie during a flight but the delay in the sound made it not usable. It worked fine but the delay was not pleasant. Great for music just not for movies.
5,Simple device that works for receiving and transmitting Bluetooth. Just charge set to RX or TX and connect it. Now I can use my wireless headphones on any device. Computer receiver etc. One button is for on/off and pairing. Sound came through without a problem and was clear. Comes with adapters to connect to 3.5 and RCA stereo sources/inputs and a power cord. It has a built in battery that seems to have decent life so far so carrying it around is easy. It's small and lightweight too. If you want Bluetooth anywhere this device should work for you.
4,It has a very short range of about15 feet.  Also if I put the plug all the way in the receiver to my iPod only one side has sound have to pull the plug partially back out for sound on both sides.
5,Neat and effective and well made! We're using this to transmit audio directly from the back of a Wally satellite receiver to a pair of wireless headphones and it works perfectly. Easy to set up and no interruption or degradation whatsoever in audio. The neat thing about this is that it doesn't interfere with the audio going to our soundbar which is plugged into the back of our TV via optical cable. We can keep both devices switched on simultaneously and then switch the soundbar off when we want to listen only on the headphones. It's so simple to use!
4,I had purchased three other of this type of device of which I had to return all of them as they were  junk.  Basically they had a great deal of latency and extremely difficult to pair.  Sometimes they would sometimes they would not.So far this one does pair although not always on the first attempt.  I do keep this plugged in all The time.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING EXCEPT A CLASS 1 BLUETOOTH DEVICE RATED AT 100 METERS:  If you want bluetooth connectivity find something rated class one with an antenna.I am the rueful owner of no less than eight of these one of which Trond replaced under warranty; four of which have taken a dump on me.Fortunately I also purchased a couple of TaoTronics TT-BA014 transmitter/receivers:  higher price point higher quality.  These outperform the Trond transmitter / receivers like a knife through butter (i.e. no dropouts within a 22' range; no malfunctions such as no longer being able to shut down when fully recharged.Three of the Trond units did the latter; two no longer pair over a 10' range.  THE STATED RANGE FOR THESE IS UP TO 33'; THE OPERATIVE TERM IN THAT RATING IS "UP TO".Bluetooth -- at best I've come to find out through this experience is a delicate technology:  the more you spend the better range you get.If you're working with video YOU NEED aptX/low latency on BOTH THE TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING END.I sincerely hope this advice -- which has now cost me a little under $300.00 -- will save SOMEBODY some money time and FRUSTRATION.
3,I bought this specifically to be used in transmit mode to interface between a hearing assist system and blue tooth hearing aids. There were two problems. One was that the volume was too low. But the deal breaker was an unacceptable amount of latency with the signal coming through the hearing aids were an echo of the live sound. For my purposes I should have given it one star but I realize other applications in which latency is not important might work OK so I was generous.
4,Works well and just what I was looking for to "cut the cord" on my receiver. It pairs with my headset more slowly than other Bluetooth devices but I don't consider that a deal breaker.  More importantly the sound quality is good as is range. I haven't tried it in transmitter mode so can't speak to that. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase and would buy it again.
5,I'm using this to connect headphones to the TV. The sound is OK no lag. The only things that a little bit annoying is the need to pair the headphones of I don't use them for more than a day or two. But that could also be due to headphones and not the TROND Transmitter.
5,Had one of these for over 10 years and it still performs flawlessly. Easy to use and has great range! Highly recommend if you use headphones. My wife loves it that I can go on headphones lol!We had a power outage recently and it lost it's pairing and I couldn't get it to re-pair. I contacted support and they told me how to do a full reset and within minutes was up and running again. Great job guys thanks a lot!
5,Set-up was easy customer support was wonderful and we watched our first movie last night with kids sleeping in next room and there was not a bit of lag.When setting up it is important to make sure headphones are not synced to anything else in the house that made the difference.  Once we did that the bluetooth connection was quick.  I paired easily with Retractable Bluetooth Headphones Headsets GRDE® Neckband Style Bluetooth 4.1 Foldable Wireless Sports Earphone Earbuds with Microphone.Lastly I got an email from customer service before the product arrived offering tips and assistance as needed thanks!
5,This is a really great product.  I have a 1946 antique Philco radio/record player  and a large collection of 78 RPM records but it is on display in the living room which is 35 feet from and one wall separated from the the room we keep the television and other media in.  I connected one TROND directly to the crystal cartridge on the record player in the transmit mode and the other in the receive mode to the AUX input on my stereo amplifier which feeds speakers in both rooms. An easy installation and works great.  Joe
5,I was told there was nothing available to allow our audio system to work with the newer iPhones. Not true! So happy This device was referred to me. This device works great and at a great price! Glad I didn’t spend the extra money on a new system.
4,I purchased two of these units. after about 6 months of use one of them stopped working. the TROND customer support was quick to reply very friendly and sent out replacement unit within days.very low latency if you're connecting two TROND devices together.i would purchase another TROND product despite the product failure.
5,This device is good for anything you want to get wireless sound from that has a headphone or audio out input. I use it with my tv and nintendo switch at night when my wife goes to sleep and it has been a great investment. I have not found any issue with it so far other than i had to restore it to default because it stopped pairing with devices but after the restore it worked fine again.
5,My husband and I work different shifts and have different sleeping habits.  He requires that the TV be on when he goes to bed whereas I like to turn the TV off at bedtime.  The solution was this TROND Bluetooth Transmitter / receiver.  Since my husband has began using this product we have both been able to sleep peacefully.  It has made a great difference and has allowed us to continue sleeping in the same room.  The product was easy to use and serves its purpose nicely.  I high recommend this product to anyone that might need it.
5,I use this when exercising to link tv to Bluetooth headphones. Set up was easy range is more than 30 ft and sound is great- no lag with the tv. The instructions say it will pair simultaneously with two devices. I haven't tried this but it's good to know.Update: after approximately one year of use I had trouble pairing with the headphones.  I had lost the user manual.  I emailed Trond support and received a very helpful reply with a pdf of the manual and a trouble shooting guide.  Problem was resolved less than one minute after reading trouble-shooting guide. Excellent customer service.
5,We received the Trond yesterday and tried to make it work.  Lots of times things don’t work on the first go so I set it aside.  Meanwhile the Trond folks had emailed me to see if everything was ok. After I wrote them that I couldn’t figure it out the Tech Rep wrote me some simple instructions which I followed and it worked!  Glad to have my husband be able to hear his shows with blue tooth headphones while I read in peace and quiet.
5,This product works exactly as advertised. I use it on my Samsung flatscreen TV.  I have age related hearing loss and this device allows me to hear the TV at a level that works for me without being way too loud for my wife.Also at night I can watch TV with out disturbing my wife who needs quiet to sleep. All in all this is a first rate product that I recommend to anyone without hesitation. And the care attention and follow-up on the part of TROND is impressive. Give this device a try ... you won't regret the purchase!
5,This device is a must! comes with multiple connections for different devices. I use it in my car and absolutely love it! I have had it plugged in for 3 days and it is still going strong off of one charge!
4,great product. but even better the service is over the top. i had some trouble setting up the device to work with my now ancient non-smart Sony brevia TV couldn't get it to work. a Trond rep Bruce was super nice answering my emails super quick answering all my questions. inexpensive product much return. get it. anyone with a bad review on here probably didn't know how to set it up
2,Researched a lot of options advertised as "choice" or "#1 seller" in bluetooth transmitters. Shortlisted Tao tronics and Trond as the contenders and finally pulled the trigger on Trond. The packaging was nice with clear instructions and setup with my bluetooth headphones "Studio 3 by Beats" was very very simple. However the sound quality AS stated by other reviewers was like coming out of airline supplied cheap one dollar headphones. I tried several sources but the same result. Connect the same headphones via wire to any of the said sources and the sound improved 99%.My purpose was to listen to music in an upcoming trip wo any wires on the plane. That plan has so far failed. The same sound quality was evident on video (though with only a tiny fraction of a lag; barely noticeable) and I am absolutely positive that you will not be liking this performance by your headphones. If the idea is to listen to your TV wirelessly just go and buy a sennheiser set you will not be dissapointed.
5,Fairly easy to use and easy to keep charge too. Being able to use it as both receiver and transmitter is great. Also highly recommended for Switch use due to its compact size. If you have any trouble with connectivity when using this check which setting you have it on first - I had a dumb moment where I kept trying to pair it to my phone as a receiver while it was still toggled to transmitter mode.
5,Product works great!. I am using one unit in TX mode connected to my Echo Dot headphone out jack and one in RX mode that is connected to a second Audio Stereo Receiver in a different room. Audio delay between real feed is very minimal and barely noticable when you can hear both feeds at the same time. Again VERY minimal delay. This review is using this product as audio. I did not need video use.Pairing between the two units was a breeze. Basically press and hold power buttons on both units and they both connected to eachother.
4,Bought this to connect the CD player (without Bluetooth) to a Bose speaker (with Bluetooth).The Bluetooth worked fine after some help from customer service. The cs was great probably the best part of this purchase.
5,Very easy to hook up and pair with my bluetooth speakers plus it now makes my turntable sound great!  For Christmas I received a turntable for all my vinyl but needed to get some sound out of it.  I tried hooking it up to my guitar amp but that really didn't work very well.  Bought this transmitter and had great sound in a matter of minutes with my two bluetooth speakers.  It comes with all the possible plug options you would need.  I highly recommend it's purchase and I would definitely buy it again.
5,What a cute little device. I struggled with the directions in the package but when I looked at the pictures on the item  from amazon it shows a depiction of what cords to use and what setting (TX or RX).  The volume control works ok when i use it for bluetooth transmission to wireless headphones on TV.
2,This is a completely misleading statement in their product description --- "...you can now watch video while listening to wireless audio in a synchronized fashion AND without any noticeable audio delay Bluetooth Transmitter with aptX Low Latency & aptX. TROND BT-DUO can help transmitting stereo audio with unnoticeable audio delay from your non-Bluetooth audio sources such as TV MP3 CD player PC or eBook reader to your Bluetooth-enabled headphones speaker or receiver."  Define "unnoticeable".  If you pair this devise with a TV and leave the tv volume up with only one ear in your headphones...there is a VERY noticeable delay.  If you turn the TV volume all the way down it is of course less noticeable...however the delay is sufficient enough to distract you from enjoying the show and focus on detecting the delay.  I expected bluetooth devises to have a delay...until the product description said there was not a "noticeable" delay.  The product does exact what it says...but the delay is sufficient enough to eventually drive you nuts and stop using this devise with a TV.
3,I bought it to use with my Nintendo switch but it's a 50/50 deal here This transmitter WORKS with the switch in portable mode but it DOESN'T work with the switch on DOCKED mode. And my question is whats the point to use Bluetooth if you have the device less than 30cm away from your face anyway? i would just use a better wired headphone and done. But yeah  I bought this to play it at night on the TV paired with some Bluetooth headset but doesn't work that way with the switch on docked mode.
5,This is a simple product. It plugs into the audio output and transmits/receives bluetooth.I used a different bluetooth transmitter and had some break up when I was more than 15 feet with a pair of headphones I use when working out.I purchased this device. Easy pairing easy setup and the bluetooth range and pickup appear better than the other device. I can easily get 30 feet of transmission without any breakup.It is small good transmission easy pairing superb range. Also very littler voice/video lag. So for this simple device five stars
5,This is a good buy purchased a second one
4,I purchased this to play Ipod through Android Bluetooth car stereo.  Stereo does not recognize it.  I tried to play through Amazon Echo (Alexa) it also does not recognize it.  I have read rumors of this but was not sure so I thought I would gamble.  My fault.
3,Super convenient however there are 2 major issues that I have with it. Really like the transmitter receiver option which is really cool.The quality of the sound is not that great definitely not CD quality.Also it doesn't have a automatic shut off which makes it a pain because you end up forgetting to turn it off and have to recharge it the next day. This wouldn't be an issue but than you get a ground loop hum because you end up having to plug it up to your car's cigarette outlet.If they had a higher quality line i would probably get that.
4,Worked well with some devices...Too much delay on others...Works good with t.v. which was my secondary use for it...
3,I bought this to connect my shuffle wirelessly to my Bluetooth headphones for running. While the device connected the two it was intermittent never holding the connection for more than 5-10 seconds. It didn't matter whether the device was in my pocket my hand or awkwardly hung at my collar.UPDATE : The product never worked well with my bluetooth headphones ... BUT as soon as they saw my review the company contacted me directly and refunded my money.  I've upped my review to 3 stars - one star for the product but 5 stars for outstanding customer service.
5,I have an iOS app (Yamaha Chord Tracker) that won't play over bluetooth - by design.  Plays over the iphone or ipad speak but not airplay or bluetooth.This little gadget solves that problem.It is both a transmitter and a receiver but not at the same time.Note: Apple ipads and iphones do not take advantage of AptX CODECs only AAC (good) or default SBC (usually meh).  This device sounds pretty good.
5,I bought it I thought maybe I overpaid for this. I'm using it to connect my dedicated MP3 player to my BT 5.0 headphones. Since my phone no longer has a headphone jack I decided to go wireless. Absolutely impressed with this device. All the extra cables it came with and the sound quality now makes me think that maybe I underpaid for it. It's small enough I can my phone MP3 player and the transmitter in the same pocket.
5,I'm only reviewing this as an aptX LL receiver but it did that perfectly out of the box (I personally measured the latency and confirmed it's aptX LL).  Before I got this one I had tried TWO of the identical-looking one sold by TaoTronics that simply didn't work as LL receivers.  But this TROND device worked great and the sound quality seems great to me (though I'm not an audiophile).
1,I have previously owned a Bluetooth transmitter and it worked great with my other Android phones. That was 6 years ago and it's battery won't hold a charge. I wanted to replace it with Bluetooth 5 and purchased 2 of these one for my wife and one for me. We are traveling internationally and wanted a way to tie into the plane's entertainment system without a being tethered by a cord. These Trond units will not connect to a Samsung S22+ or S22 Ultra or an iPhone 10. I am not happy and will not recommend this device.
5,I received the easy to follow instructions by email on how to set it up.In TX (transmit) mode:I plugged it into my Sony WM-FS420 WalkmanI paired the TROND to my Sony MDR-1RTB MK2 Bluetooth over the ear headphones.And it worked very well.in RX (receive) mode:I pluged my Sony MDR-W014 (Non-Bluetooth) earphones into the TRONDI paired the TROND to my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2It worked ok.No lag between video and voice.But there was a slight crackle noise when I opened or closed an applicationSame noise with my LG 840 smartphone.
2,My Trond 2 works well except the audio cuts out at lower volumes when no one‘s talking the background music and ambient sound cuts out. Another reviewer reported this. I have to turn up the volume in my ear buds higher than I’d like to keep the sound from cutting out.Audio engineers would call it a gate. I suspect it’s implemented to prevent the user from hearing buzzing that sometimes comes from audio systems. My system has no buzzing and therefore is in no need of an audio gate. If I can’t find a way to get the sound to stay on at low volumes I’ll have to return it. I emailed eTrond customer support...waiting for reply.  TROND emailed me back and said that although they realize this is not the behavior I’m reporting is not a good listening experience this is the way the chip inside the unit operates. Not good...This
5,We used these on international flights - including a 17 hour flight. They definitely last ~6-7 hours of constant use - syncing was very easy and quick with our bluetooth headphones. Very low latency - I didn't really notice it at all.Tip - if you're on a very long flight make sure you bring a battery pack or have access to in-seat power so you can recharge the receiver while napping or switching planes etc.
5,I have an on-dash Sirius satellite radio receiver that  needed a wire to listen to on my Bose QC 35 Bluetooth headset. Not anymore with this unit. It works perfectly and was easy for me to use. One plug into the receiver one plug for power and you're ready to roll. It's a small discrete little unit that looks and even feels cool. It has a range of about 40 feet too. If you're sick of wires like I am and want to clean up and simplify this product is for you.
5,Worked on my flight with by BeatsX bluetooth headphones. The volume of the audio through this transmitter is lower than connecting wired headphones directly to the jack but not a big deal. It works exactly as anticipated. I can't yet speak to battery life over the long term but it lasted through my 6 hour flight with battery life to spare the first time I used it.
4,A bit fussy in connecting. Not sure yet about length of charge but seems to be holding up well.
4,Wanted something so I could play for steam movies and not wake everyone in the house. It works perfectly if the Switch with no lag. However not so well with Netflix or Amazon fire stick the is serious lag time might as well watch with subtitles.
2,Internal battery is too small. Only last a couple of hours. Lasted less than 10 charging cycles and went unusable; you will have to use the USB always connected.
5,The transmitter-Receiver unit worked very under a computer test with my new Bluetooth earphones.  The unit will be used in the future with a large screen LCD TV and the earphones.  The TROND V5.0 Transmitter Receiver was easy and fast to pair with my earphones. Over all a great experience with my first Bluetooth device.  Cannot respond to the rating of "Battery Life" because I have no experience with that situation so far!
5,Currently using the transmitter for sound from my receiver while watching TV and get excellent sound and dialog.
4,Received the item and could not get it to work initially. Email tech support. They responded within hours. Gave me a procedure which worked like a charm. Very satisfied. Evidently the instruction manual did not address non pairing.Highly recommend any initial problems be directed to tech support. Probably save you from returning the item.Very satisfied with the product.
4,My Trond 2- in-1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmtter was working well interfacing between my Samsung TV and my headphones. Suddenly it stopped working. I contacted customer support via email and received prompt responses. After trying various unsuccessful ways to get the functionality back I was shipped a new unit. All is well now and this new unit is working fine.
5,I have two of these; one on each television and they work great. Customer service is outstanding. I had a small issue with setting up the second one and my email was returned on a Saturday night within an hour (maybe even less).  Was able to set up the second one easily afterwards. I can now watch television without having to hear my ridiculously loud neighbors. Great product. If you have issues email customer service before you return the item.  They will respond quickly and no doubt solve the problem you are having.
5,So far I've been very impressed with the ease of set up and use. I have a pair of Pyle outdoor Bluetooth speakers and the Trond transmitter connected right away. I have the transmitter inside my garage connected to my mini stereo and the speakers are outside approx. 15 feet away and through a brick wall. The sound is clear and I don't notice any latency. Even though I have some volume control on the speakers the primary volume is controlled by my stereo.
4,Wow what a good purchase. small size pairs easily -overall a good purchase to watch TV or workout videos without being loud to your loved ones. i feel the connection is a bit flaky sometimes when im moving in the living room. No big deal very good solution to make your TV a transmitter or receiver easily..
3,I bought the Trond it may have been faulty maybe it was my fugoo speaker that didn’t work with it.  The trond paird with my headphones and a bunch of other sources but I could not manage to get it to work with my fugoo speaker.  I was trying to use the trond to as a transmitter from my projector to my Bluetooth speaker. It would pair but it would not play any music. The support for this product was unimpressive and slow so I jut returned it.
4,This transmitter is great.  Except for some pairing problems (which a tech.support help resolve easily) I've had no problems.  I find it helpful to leave the charger connected to a USB port or A/C adapter to avoid unexpected shutdown during overnight or other long period use.I recommend this product for those who want easy to use Bluetooth listening.
5,We added headphones to our tv with this device and couldn't be happier.  My wife can now go all over the house and still listen to the shows while doing other things.  We have had it about 9 months and it's been faultless.  Great value for something that works so well.
5,This device works great. I was able to get it set up with no problems. I look forward to using it in the future.Update: I had to reconnect the device because I got a new phone and had to delete all devices attached to my Bluetooth headphones including this one. I had trouble reconnecting and sent an email to support. Within a couple of hours they sent me a procedure to reset the device and it worked. I was impressed with how fast they responded and that they gave me a solution that fixed my issue.
5,Bluetooth Heaven.  That's what this is.  Until two weeks ago ... I could only dream that this device even existed.  Today - my dreams have come true.  Imagine being able to pair your favorite BT headphones and connect with any audio out.  TV.  Airplane.  Stereo.  It's crazy.  Took me a little while to get how to pair this puppy dog with my iPhone Ear Buds ... but I did it.  And it's truly fantastic.
5,Bluetoothed my 2003 Honda Goldwing. I LOVE this gadget it was exactly what I was looking for and IT WORKS GREAT !! I wanted a way to listen to music on my Iphone 6 via bluetooth to my 2003 Goldwing stock radio. I purchased the J & M audio cord that plugs into and under the left side pocket honda white connection end and the 3.5mm end of that cord plugs into this Trond transmitter and sync it up to my phone BOOM listening to my tunes over the goldwing stereo !!!
4,This product cane quickly and was as as described. The description states that it connects with 2 devices which is the reason I purchased this product. While this is true I assume it is very confusing to try and do. You must connect with the first device unconnected then connect with the second device then connect with the first device again. I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly.
3,Edit: Have been working with their customer service for a fix to my issue. The customer support seems great from what I can tell!Setup was pretty easy had it connected with some airpods in just a few minutes. Worked great for a short time but now the sound constantly fades in and out. Will be trying to return it. I haven't had it long enough to comment on the durability or battery life.(Intent was to connect apple airpods with a nintendo switch.)
4,Bought in conjunction with bluetooth headphones so that I could listen to TV in bed without having to hear the wife snoring. The indicator light is really bright in a dark room but I laid a sock over it so it's all good. Comes with cable adapters as well.
5,Although I have only used it as a Bluetooth transmitter I am pleased with this product
5,Our Samsung TV has no blue tooth connectivity but the TROND transmitter solved that issue.  I had a bit of trouble getting the transmitter to pair with our headphones but the customer service people at TROND were awesome and extremely helpful.  If we need a similar product in the future I will definitely look at TROND First
4,Control buttons are not easy to feel. Trying to control often pulls out earpiece.
5,I'm pairing bluetooth headphones and connecting it to my son digital piano in tx mode works perfectly with apple airpods and I'm sharing phones with son when he is practicing - awesome considering neighbors and noice from piano without phones. I'm also planning to pick it in my next transatlantic - should work perfectly for audio from media system in plainno wires!this device is very helpful!
4,Product works great.  Hooked it up using the enclosed cables. Paired quickly with my headphones.But...make sure your headphones are compatible with AptX technology.  My Bose QC35 headphones do not have AptX and there was noticeable latency and audio sync issues.  This is not the fault of the Bluetooth transmitter.  TROND responded to my posted question quickly and provided good information.
1,this product doesn't pair not worth the money waste
3,Unfortunately this device produces too much background static for me when I use it so I can't give it 5 stars but I'm upping my rating from 1 to 3 stars because they've tried hard to fix the issue by sending a replacement which didn't fix the issue. It might just be an issue with this particular device and my phone.
3,It seems to not be doing its job as it is not transmitting in Stereo.I use it with my office desktop and when paired to my Bluetooth headphones sound just comes from the right side.Already checked the headphones (working) my desktop PC (working) and the AUX cable included (seems to be working).I tested this unit with a different AUX cable but it fails as well. Seems the unit itself fails. Any thoughts @TROND?
4,My 1st day testing went very well. Good range and voice latency playing video or TV is good.Will update if any problems arise in the future.
5,This worked really good for about 18 months and then the battery would not hold a charge but the unit still worked if you left it plugged into a power supply. I contracted Trond and they honored their warranty and exchanged the unit in a very timely manner!  Great business principles! The new unit works just great again. I use it mostly to interface from my old Stereo receiver to my newer bluetooth sound bar. Very pleased with the product and the customer service.
3,I purchased this for my Vizio tv. I wanted to be able to listen to audio through my Bose QuietComfort headphones. I also have a Bluetooth speaker.The use of pairing two devices is a challenge and for some reason only works once after completing the complex setup process. I mostly use my headphones but the sound quality is "piss poor" most of the time. There is this feedback noise that happens often and a low staticy noise that is constant. This will be a definite return for me.
5,Works as advertised so far and it was reasonably priced
4,Did jury is still out on this it seems to have very low latency but there seems to be some compression that goes on that I can't really put my finger on and especially I guess when the battery starts getting low and I'm assuming to save battery power but when the battery is hot and it's working it's great
5,We got this so we could play MP3s from our phones through our still-good JVC system.  We have coupled this with a 128GB thumb drive that plugs into our iPhones.  Provided Trond cables allow connecting to the AUX jacks on back of JVC reception is fine from within the room (have no need to test farther away).  Eventually we will get away from CD's and this will be a big help!
1,Product worked for a few days then failed to pair.  Support requested but never answered.
4,Can't give it 5 stars yet because i havent had it that long but since Amazon is puching for feedback...here goes.  Setup was easy.  Sound quality is very good.  Overall happy especially for the price
5,I bought this to use with my old keyboard and a pair of Bluetooth headphones that I already have. It works wonderfully just plug the inputs into the audio ports on the keyboard  turn it on and you are in business! The only complaint I have is that the battery life is not longer meaning I have to charge this adapter as well as charge my Bluetooth headphones.
4,Me gustó mucho. Realmente funcionó y resolvió.
5,Worked with my Bluetooth ear buds but the 45ms delay would not allow for synchronous singing. A bit too distracting. As that was why I tried them they did not work for my usage.
4,I'm not sure if it is my headphones or the TROND but there is a sound delay when listening.
5,Exactly what I was looking for.  I have this connected to the line out of my projector which is transmitting to 2 separate bluetooth speakers.  It was very easy and quick to set up.  I now essentially have stereo sound for my makeshift home theatre.  This is perfect and easy to set up for a backyard movie night.  No need for cables and splitters anymore.  Plus this device is tiny.  Easy to hide and keep out of site.  Great little device.
4,There are some really bad cheap Bluetooth devices out there but not this one. It amplifies the volume really well you actually have to be cautious when plugging in headphones because the volume is really loud.
2,I connected 2 bluetooth speakers at the same time to create speaker "party mode". One runs bt 4.1 and the other 4.2. Sometimes they are in sync and then goes out of sync creating an echo effect. It can get pretty bad. Tried the Taotronics unit and the same thing happened. I think the echo is slightly better with the Trond but I think the chipset on this unit is slightly more modern (Tatronics has a newer version now too).
5,Bought this so we could use wireless headphones with our turntable. The turntable only had bluetooth output to send sound to speakers.  This worked perfectly. It's not too bulky so doesn't look bad when plugged in to the headphone jack. Love it.
5,The device didn’t work out for my needs but their customer service team is Great!! They will go out if their way to make things right. Great company to work with!
5,It was super easy to use.  I just plugged my old computer speakers into the little unit and paired my phone with bluetooth.  What I really like that it does not interfere with phone conversations or speech-to-text like most bt speaker systems!  I keep the unit plugged into the speakers so I don't need the battery feature.  Really great customer service.  They help resolve questions and make sure it is working well for you.
5,I use this Bluetooth transmitter via my surround receiver to privately listen to my TV/Music/Movies etc through headphones.  Was able to connect two headphones as advertised.  Both my wife and I can enjoy the sound output privately and the headphones each have volume control hence personalized settings.  So far the device works wonderfully.  Time will tell if it has a high survivability rate.  A must if you're subwoofer can "bother" the neighbors.
4,Initially worked well and paired easily but failed after less than a week. No longer powers up and charge light never goes off even after charging overnight. Customer service responded and replaced the defective unit with minimal hassle. The replacementunit has worked without problems.
5,I have changed my rating due to the fact that the customer service from TROND has been so fantastic following up with me through email to help me get the product to work.  I ended up buying a better set of headphones that had CLEAR instructions on pairing with the TROND Transmitter.  That made such a big difference it worked first time.
4,I want blutooth recording but theres alot of lag. Good for listening but not recording.
4,Customer service was outstanding.  The fix worked the first time I applied it.  Response was very timely.  The instructions were somewhat lacking but Trond has said they are working on it to make it clearer.  Very satisfied with my experience.  Always a pleasure doing business with a company that is sincere in assisting their clients.
4,Works great in my 09 bmw 135i with an iPhone 7. I can control volume with my steering controls but not song. I wish it would automatically turn on/start playing when I get in the car. I have to turn on the device each time I get in the car.
1,The device will not work in transmission mode (TX). It connects well as a receiver and the instructions provided are simple enough. It would not transmit to 2 windows pc 2 different android phones or 2 different generation nvidia shield but all devices can connect and pair to it in receiver mode (RX).
5,So far I have used it only as a transmitter and it works great. you do have to carefully follow directions. if it doesn't work right away it's probably due to the headsets being already paired to your phone or another device. I connect it to my Vizio TV using the RCA audio cables. Because the usb port on my TV doesn't produce electricity while the TV is off I connect the TROND's usb power cable to my DirecTV box since that usb port is always on. The Trond never runs out of battery this way.
3,It works exceptionally well in regards to range and the latency if properly matched with 4.2 aptx enabled receiving unit. Albeit it does allow a bit of electrical interference in terms of the auxiliary port and 3.5 mm jack. I wouldn't find this alarming in choosing the product because at its price point I am not expecting the cleanest signal on that end. I will be checking out avantree's more expensive transmitter in the future to see if 30 extra bones is worth it for similar performance but perhaps less electrical interference in the audio.
5,I recently got an APTX capable Bluetooth adapter for my car's AUX input. I had been using my iPhone's Bluetooth directly but it doesn't support the APTX codec. I now use the TROND device to connect my iPhone to the car stereo and have heard a little bit of improvement at higher volumes. It may be a placebo effect... but I think it sounds better :-).The device works as advertised and pairing was easy. Also now if anyone brings a prehistoric audio device in my car I can connect it to my car's Bluetooth.
5,Plugged it in turned it on. Told Alexa the echo dot to connect to Bluetooth. Boom I have the record player playing throughout the house in every room. Came with everything I needed to plug analog to digital
3,It works for what I need it to do. I'd give it 5 stars if I could connect to my phones bluetooth easier. Seems like I have to resync every time I want to use it. And it takes several tries to establish the connection. Once I get the connection this little guy works great. I like to take it on trips where my wife and I can watch Netflix on our tablet without waking up the kids.
5,The product is amazing. I can walk anywhere around my house with my headphones on and hear audio from my PC. Down the hall around the corner and through closed doors the sound doesn't cut out at all. It's super easy to connect. It works better than the Bluetooth on my laptop or my phone.
5,I was having a problem trying to get my bluetooth speakers to work I ordered this productI used the smart phone bluetooth as my main signal for one speakerI then plugged the device into the phone turn on the other speaker and theTrond provided a signal for the other bluetooth speaker and now they both play at the same time. ..So it can be done...so I gave this product 5 stars because before I had it...I could only play one speaker...so it superseded all of my expectation and Im a very satisfied customer.
4,I had trouble getting the TROND attached to my TV to pair with my Anker speaker by following the printed instructions so I emailed a rep. He sent back explicit instructions and I paired the two on the first attempt.
5,this little baby is a lifesaver if one of you likes to watch TV in bed and the other wants to sleep... while it doesn't eliminate the light from the TV it sure does eliminate the sound which is now streamed via Bluetooth to your compatible headphones.. less disturbance and noise equates to better sleep for your partner..
5,Excellent Operational Quality  does just what it's supposed to do and does it without any perceptible time delay and without digital audio artifacts.  Nice !!!
5,This works great transmitting sound from my projector to my JBL speaker with no lag at all! Couldn't be happier!
5,Love how good this woks 👍🏼 It’s small enough to carry with you anywhere & it’s so easy to use. The sound is so clear! It’s such a good tool to have.
5,I have been using this on TX mode and works beautifully.  I can use any Bluetooth headphones to listen to video game console tv cable box roku and Apple TV.  Listening to all these modes at night lying in bed because I am partially deaf and cannot hear tv while not using my hearing aid while not wearing them while laying in bed.  Now I put my Bluetooth in ear headphones on and can nod off watching and listening to my tv.
5,I bought this to pair my VANKYO projector to a Bluetooth speaker. Pairing was super easy. I didn't notice any sound delay. This is a nice product that doesn't disappoint. 100% recommended.
4,The setup was straight forward  and easy. The unit worked well with my Sennheiser headphones.  I do occasionally get some static asI move around however its only for a second and then it fades quickly.  I don't know whether its my headphones or the transmitter but  I will tolerate it because its so temporary.
5,The TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter works just as it should.  Reading the instructions is very important especially when hooking up 2 headphones to it.  When watching TV I didn't notice any lag in the sound so that was nice.  Overall I'm glad I bought it so that I could listen to my movies while the family sleeps.  The company that makes it sends an email in case you have any questions on how to use it and to make sure you're happy with the unit.
3,Easy to setup. Good audio quality for bluetooth. Only issue is range. Have it setup under a patio outdoors with no obstructions you get about 10ft before it starts to cut out.  I get much more range out of other bluetooth devices.
5,I’ll keep the review short and sweetThe device is the size of a narrow matchbox and holds a connection incredibly well even better than my MacBook Pro which cuts out BT connection with every headphone I have.It’s fast to pair over both TX (transmit) and RX (receive) and has seemed to last the advertised 8 hours on battery.I have mine attached to a Nintendo Switch with a small Velcro strip and ultra short 3.5mm interconnect cable.Recommended!
5,Love this!! I still love using my iPod. This makes it possible to use Bluetooth headphones or attached to a Bluetooth speaker. It’s great
4,Blue tooth is dicey at  best but mine works and I keep it on 24/7. Paired with JBL headphones. Sitdown start the movie turn on the headphones and presto it works. No side show of haviing to re-pair it just works like I expected.
4,I live in a noisy apartment building with thin walls...this is perfect for me to watch tv at all hours without disturbing and for me toenjoy without interruption! Wish the battery lasted a little longer
3,When I bought my new truck i was shocked to find no Auxillary port to play my Microsoft Zune through.  After a little research I settled on the Trond 2-in-1 Transmitter with the hopes of using bluetooth to play my music.  After hours of trying I got it to pair with my F-150 but it wouldn't transmit my music.  I gave up and ended up moving my music to a USB key to play.
5,Great Product
5,I am a DJ and was always tripping over my headphone cable. I was skeptical that this would be any good for the price but worth a try. I am amazed! Only one button so pretty dummy proof. I have tested against my wired setup and there is almost no latency that is recognizable. Great product. I have not used it as a BT receiver at all just in transmit mode.
3,This product worked at the gym. I was happy that they support team tried everything on their end and even offered a replacement for a different product.I wish that they worked. Here is my pros and cons on this product.prosIt pairs easily to your headphones it paired to beats x and AirPods quicklyCharges super quickCons The volume was low it sounded like someone is whispering in your ear.
5,Bought to stream music to klipsch sound barBut unfortunately it does work well with it(There are gaps and noises when streamed from the device to the sound bar)update: the support team contacted me tried to solve the problem and eventually refunded the order without me even me asking to do so.best support ever.UPDATE - one year later bought one more to connect RX to TXworks great!
1,Easy to set up but while using Bluetooth you can barely hear it unless you turn it up at max volume. Disappointed
5,Seems to work great! I’m using it with a small radio at baseball games to listen to the live broadcasts. So far no complaints! Both my wife and I can use this device with small Bluetooth headphones without any wires which is important at games since you are constantly getting up and down. So far no interference and great sound quality. Pulse the pairing was super simple.
5,Wow! Beats anything I've tried so far. Battery life is absolutely out of this world. I've left it on all day and when I got home from work it was still going strong. Couldn't believe it.
2,Was easy to set up and connect to my bluetooth speaker but the lag is too much for it to be useable. I hooked the transmitter to my video projector the Kodak Lumina 75 and then transmitted to my bluetooth speaker. The sound lag is couple seconds behind the video it does not line up at all. I will have to figure out a different setup unfortunately.
5,This product works great…any I was a little worried that it wouldn’t.  My wife and I both have wireless Bluetooth earphones.  With the eTrond splitter connected to my Amazon Fire Phone (which works great too) my wife and I are both able to listen to the audio books on my phone as we go on long wonderful healthy walks.  Very great thing to do but we needed the eTrond to make it possible to run two sets of earphones off of one cell phone—which it does flawlessly.
4,4.5  It is working Great! My bluetooth headphones sync perfect with the Trond 2-1 when I watch TV. The technology has hit a new mark. I would have given a 5 but the pairing was a little difficult for me.
5,This transmitter works perfectly with VERY LOW latency.  While watching videos through my projector I can now transmit the audio via bluetooth.. and with the bluetooth 4.1 there is no sync issues whatsoever with the voice and the video.It is very easy to pair (once you turn it on... you just double click the button... and it finds the speaker) Just make sure the speaker is the only bluetooth device currently on.  Once paired... it will just connect again and you no longer have to worry about other bluetooth devices.
1,I returned this item after just 1 day.  I purchased to use with the treadmill at my gym.  I liked the idea of being able to plug into the treadmill and watch tv while I run wirelessly.  I read instructions from front to back and just couldn’t get it to work right with multiple headsets and sources.  I could only get sound in one ear and the volume at top level was not good enough to compete with the noise in the gym.  As for pairing the unit - that was pretty easy they claim once you pair to a headset it will automatically connect when you turn it on again.  Well that’s not the case at all.  I set up pairing at home and when I went to try it at the gym I had to pair it again.  I only rated the battery life as good since it stayed charged while I had it but I didn’t have the opportunity to really test the battery life.I may have got a bad unit but I am not willing to waste my time to get a replacement.
5,I use this device mainly to stream FM radio from my phone to a bluetooth speaker and to stream TV/Movie soundtracks from my Amazon FIre HD6 to a bluetooth speaker. I must say this device does both with alarming ease and accuracy. Pairs seamlessly never drops out and there's never any lag between the TV/Movie soundtrack and the audio from my Bluetooth speaker. Works flawlessly for all of my needs. I'll likely buy another to install on my home stereo to stream internet radio to my home audio system. Great job TROND®!
4,The headphone  with the TROND was functioning very well. However when I tried to connect the  2 x RCA Male 1 x 3.5mm Stereo Female Y-Cable I was not able to hear anything I could not pair it. I tried everything but I was not successful. Reading the reviews some other people had the same problem.
4,I got this for my husband so that he could use his old iPod with his new beats wireless headphones. That part works like a charm!He did state that the volume does not get very high and I had read that in a few of the reviews other than that this product works well.
1,Another Amazon fail. Connected and tried on both frequencies.  Doesn’t work. Off to the donation bin.
5,I have only used it a few times while flying but I've been really thrilled so far. The sound is excellent and on one charge I used it from Tampa to San Diego and back with just a few other times since then. My only point of irritation is that it's not super convenient to pocket for activities outdoors. But that is such a negligible concern that I'm not even taking a star off.
4,Purchased this to pair up with my bluetooth headphones. Paired up perfectly the first time and every time since. When using it with my TV there is a latency problem to the point I have to turn off the sound of the TV. Not a deal breaker for me...I love this device! Also works great with my iPod.
1,this transmitter is ok not all that great and haven't been to impressed with it.  Kind of a pain to pair it with my wireless headphones and I have paired it with four different sets of headphones.  It takes a bit of messing with it to before it will finally pair.  I have paired it with Jaybird x3 and x2 bose and JVC headphones.  So its not brand specific why its a pain to pair.  The battery last about day at best if I forget to turn it off and its not plugged in to charge.  So thats another reason I have not been impressed by them.  About 70 percent of the time they seem to lag about a second behind my tv of what i am watching.  So its really hit or miss whether this thing is gonna work good or not.  Who knows maybe I got a dud or something.  I have another Bluetooth wireless transmitter different brand and that one has never given me an issue and last about 3 days if it remains on with no use. No lag either from my other transmitter.  Save your money and look for another brand I would say.
4,It took me many tries to figure out the various steady and flashing red and blue lights on both the Trond and also my earphones but device is working well now. One suggestion: We seniors really have trouble reading the small type of the directions.
5,I didn't even have to read the directions.  The back of my TV had a plug in labeled for audio out and I used the enclosed that came with the transmitter.  It connected and my headphones sounded great.  A good buy.
4,It works great for a reciever and transmitter the single button control leaves a bit to be desired. The control is the only part of this unit I dislike its a bit confusing and it took a while to remember the process to set it up and then to conect to a pair of speakers.
5,Easy to pair and use. I connected to my stereo receiver which is connected to my television so I can listen wirelessly when on my bicycle trainer or treadmill. Keeps the wife happy by not having to have the TV volume high to compensate for the workout equipment noise.
5,I really like this. It allows me to use my Bose quiet comfort headphones II with my Nintendo switch wirelessly. In the description it said that with these headphones there may be significant latency but so far I haven't experienced any while playing breath of the wild diablo 3 or nsmb deluxe. I use the 3.5mm audio adapter that was supplied instead of the 3.5mm aux cable for this result.
5,This product worked flawlessly right out of the box! Both as a transmitter and as a receiver. I have two months of intense use on my Trond and I like it so much I am going to purchase another one today. Also my Trond has no latency problems at all so my head phones work perfectly for watching television. A big plus is being able to use my trond to stream music to both my powered wireless speakers at the same time. The Trond (BTR) is a great product. respectfully JMJr.
4,Battery life isn't very good even when fully charged and left for a few days without use. I don't use the adapter very often so it must be changed before each use. Otherwise works better than I'd anticipated and I'm very satisfied.
5,Excelente sonido con aptx falta control de volumen. funciona con 2 dispositivos en simultáneo 😁lo hace muy versátil
2,No it will not reconnect and I will not recommend it. Installed on dedicated car ligher adapter switch/relays cuts power off (normal on the vehicle) you return 2 minutes it will not reconnect on its own regardless of device paired (6 different devices). Note that the device is fully charged.Now to be able to listen to music you can press the main button for 2 seconds which may not be an inconvenience for some. However on a motorcycle setting it's not only an inconvenience it's a bit of a safety concern so is in a car setting.Now range is great and battery life is decent but without an automatic shut off function battery implementation is a bust.Also you will loose paired devices when battery dies so back to square one unless you risk to be stranded on the long run with a always hot cigarette lighter (assuming you have that option).
5,I needed this to pair with my Bluetooth 5 earphones this way I could listen to sound with low latency. I was pleasantly surprised it worked great with the Aukey brand also. It is very small and the battery has been awesome so far. It would be nice on these devices if there would be  away to know the % of battery left. Oh well.
5,Easy to set up
3,Worked great. But due to it being behind the TV I had to pull me 75’ inch tv mount out every time I had to reconnect it since the USB port kept the device powered on even when the TV was off. The device goes to sleep after 5min of no connection. Since the sound bar it’s connected to shuts down with the tv.
5,I use it to connect a DLP TV and with Bluetooth headphones for me to run on a treadmill. it is easy to install and setup. the TX module works very well for the past several days. So far so good I recommend it to you if you want to connect to an old TV like me.
4,Like others have stated its great for music but there are latency issues (lag) when viewing most video on a television. There is probably a half second or less delay but it is there. If the tv speakers are on you get an echo. It is especially noticeable on closeups.
4,For the price it works well for me I feel that the battery could last longer
3,It is very hard to sync. It's very persnickety and with just the one button and no display it's hard to understand which t you didn't cross that is hanging you up. Once I have it working though I love it. I am 51. If you are young and tech savvy I suspect it won't give you any trouble but if you have trouble with less than user friendly things you might not want to bother with this.
4,The transmitter works fine. I use it with my Powerbeats and my Ipod 160gb. The only problem is the cord that attaches the transmitter to your device. The cord gave out pretty quickly. I got around that problem by using a regular length aux cords. Works fine now.
5,I'm using this transmitter in the audio port of an older television.  Works great! I don't have to worry about disturbing others when I'm watching TV & can listen (using Bluetooth headphones) as loudly as I want. Definitely worth the money.
2,Bought this to pair my iPhone 5 to 2 AmazonBasics portable bluetooth speakers.  The device transmits and receives but not at the same time so I plugged it in via its cable to my phone's headphone plug and set it on transmit.  It is very onerous to get two devices to pair to it but I was able to do that; the problem is there is almost always a lag between them so the music is not in sync coming from the speakers.  Every time you shut everything off they have to re-pair when you turn them back on so even though one time out of the many I tried the speakers were perfectly synced (and sounded really great) since it's not practical to leave them on all the time the product is useless for this purpose.  For a single BT device it would seem to work pretty well.
4,It takes care of the job but it has only 8 hrs of battery life so you have to get up and turn it off at the TV and then be sure to recharge it.
4,It stopped working after a short time time. The company offered a free replacement or refund. Great customer service.
5,I like this product better then the August MR260 I sent back. This one has Bluetooth 4.1 and Aptx instead of Bluetooth 2.1 which is old tech. The Aptx works great with my Idea Atomicx W203s! Stays reconnected after it's turned off and on. Haven't tried the charge while using yet. Am thinking about buying another one so i can use non Bluetooth headphones. There is no lag in the video on voices at least for me there isn't. I highly recommend these if you need one. It is very nice.
4,It works just as well as I had hoped it would.
4,Bought this to watch late night TV to not disturb anyone else in the household. Didn't work.However with new instructions sent by manufacturer was able to connect with no problem. Device works as advertised.Will give a 4 star because instructions in original packaging should be more clear.
2,So I finally found a Bluetooth transmitter to add onto my TV. The only slight problem I have is that sometimes during certain movies it almost sounds like it chops off the sound when several characters are talking. Kinda like a VOIP call. Haven't quite found the pattern so don't know if it's the movie or the Bluetooth transmitter or the Bluetooth earbuds. I'll figure it out. Great part is I was able to connect several different Bluetooth earbuds and headsets to it. **REVISED** Seems like the cutting out on low volume is "as designed". Sending it back.
3,The range and quality of sound are good. The device holds a charge for 10 hours although our speaker will for 15 hours.  That's still probably more than enough.  I think the transmitter style that plugs into my ipod where it charges is more convenient requires less "stuff" and will work as long as there is battery life in the ipod instead of relying on its own charge (the TROND is something else to remember to charge.)
5,I am 60 years old and no longer a very tech savvy person so I was nervous when my teenage son bought me this as a Fathers Day present.  It is so easy to use though that I didn't even have to ask him for help.  It works just great to transmit music from my iPod to my Bluetooth speakers (which speakers were also a gift from a different child).
5,I have a modified classic 256gb  ipod with no bluetooth option and this device works like a dream on multiple bluetooth speakers..  well worth the money.
5,So far so good reception 10-15ft away even with room barrier and working with apple airpods pro without cut off of connectivity.
5,I previously wrote a review that this product did not work for me but i take it back  a friend got it to work with my old old ipod nano to a bluetooth speaker and i am happy.great item!
5,I originally bought one about 6 months ago for a home audio system and recently bought a second for car audio after I was thoroughly surprised by every aspect of this device. I highly recommend Trond as a brand for Bluetooth and will be buying more from them in the future.
4,I'm revising my review.  The customer service was great and we eventually got it to work to our satisfaction.  It's not the easiest device to pair but it does what it says it will do and we use it everyday when we workout.  I'll be keeping it after all.
4,Occasional problems connecting to Bluetooth  and staying connected. Seems to be a good product other than that.
5,Helping organize a smaller venue wedding since there were two mid size rooms I wanted to supply the same music from an iPod to two Bose speakers. Once we had three playlists set up wedding dinner & dance we crossed our fingers. This unit performed 100%!! It connected to both speakers loud and clear no breaks on the streaming. All you need to do is keep the speakers within a good working range of the unit. I 100% recommend it!
1,This product simply does not connect to the Bluetooth device. You'll troubleshoot for hours and send the thing back. There is no way for the pairing to accept the given code that is generated or if it does it's rare. Skip it. Find something else.
3,Hard enough to setup the dual speaker connection and then it sounded echoey. I tried different speakers and disconnecting and redoing the connection and it still sounded echoey.
3,I'm trying to pair a 2017 Ram 2500 truck media center with BT-DUO without success.  I've followed the instructions carefully for both TX and RX.  I'm attempting to get music etc. from a CD player.  BTW I have been successful in pairing with a bluetooth speaker with the CD player using BT-DUO as an intermediary. This seems to be a great product but have not succeeded with the truck.Any help would be appreciated
5,Easy to setup just plug and go works great
5,This is a GREAT little BT transmitter/receiver.  I had a problem with the BT pairing mode while traveling -- did not have the operating manual with me.  I contacted support via e-mail and in VERY short order had a reply that totally fixed the problem (along with a gentle reminder that the BT reset info I needed was in the manual FAQ).  Couldn't be more pleased.
4,Works well but its slow and has a long lag in its signal.
4,not enough volume.
2,I used this with 2 headphones. Worked like a champ. It took me a few tries to get the headphones to pair but I finally figured out how the transmitter works to pair with Bluetooth connections. Also discovered that it is best to have this connected to a USB charger so that it does not drop dead in the middle of listening on the headphones. Product does have a reliable set of instructions unlike most electronics these days.After a couple of weeks the transmitter would stop transmitting after using it for a period of time. The blue light would remain on and I would be unable to pair or turn off the transmitter until I completely drained the battery.I would give this 5 stars for operating performance and zero stars for durability.
5,It is useful to anyone who wants a versatile device that works as both a receiver and transmitter at a really good price.  I use it for all my old devices without blue tooth.
5,At first I couldn't get my phone to pick up the trond with the scan for Bluetooth from my phone. So after reading the trouble shooting page on the instruction page. Tried the suggestion that I put my Phone within a foot of the Trond my phone pick it up and paired with the unit. It has word perfectly ever since.
5,worked great until battery needed recharged  now battery wont recharge . they cheerfully sent me a replacement and it works great
5,i'm using this in transmitter mode. my pairing of headphones was a little tricky because my phone was too close. so those having trouble make sure to disable bluetooth of currently paired to device.  works perfectly and have already recommended this device to another person as an xmas gift.
5,At first blush the instructions appeared confusing and made it sound like you had to charge it before using but if you're using it for headphones to your TV it works immediately and easily. No latency issues and as long as you stay in the living room no signal loss. Really happy with this purchase.  My wife and I can watch the same thing at different volumes and not wake up the babies.  Exactly what we wanted.
5,I bought a similar priced item from best buy and it was terrible I returned it 5 minutes after I bought it. I would describe the sound quality of the one i bought at best buy as sounding like my phone speaker only louder with zero bass. After about a week of research online I decided to try the TROND. The TROND sound quality is incredible just as good as with an aux cord if not better. I absolutely love it and would absolutely recommend buying this..
5,Love this little transmitter!! I use it all the time with my old iPod and Bluetooth headphones and it works great! I also use it with the bike and elliptical machines at the gym for watching TV. It works perfectly with the headphones there too. I just have to turn off the Bluetooth in my phone if I have it with me so the transmitter isn't trying to connect to more than one thing at a time.
4,The device is handy and working fine with my Sony Xperia Android and iPhone.The battery can be lasted for 1-2 days.Since I am using in my car and I have to switch off manually every time I turned off my engine.Sound quality is normal as radio.
5,This is a Really Great and versatile device! I have used this to transmit a signal from my regular CD boombox to my Bluetooth speaker. If you wanted you could use this ( with the 3.5mm cord to the output of your TV and connect it to an external or Bluetooth speaker. Well worth the extra month as opposed to a ordinary Bluetooth adapter. Thanks.
4,Works well tho it is helpful if you read the instructions. Used it  with Bluetooth headphones on a couple of recent long flights. It did exactly what it was supposed to do!
3,When the audio drops I power off the transmitter and the bt speaker makes a sound acknowledging that the the TROND  has turned off.  Once I power it back on after a few blue blinks and reconnects the bt speaker.  I have to do this at least 2 to 3 times per hour.  Making me nuts!!!
4,Works as described.
3,I couldn’t hook it up to my TV because I only had HDMI connections on the TV so I didn’t really get a chance to use it.  Maybe you should make it with HDMI connection. All my tv don’t have a RCA connection spot on the back of my TVs.
4,Works good for the most part. But i noticed if the audio gets to quite it completely mutes it which is really annoying during video games. Sound cuts in and out
1,Stopped working after a couple days and had a horrible buzz in headphones that was never there.
5,I got this to replace an older Bluetooth transmitter that didn’t work well with my Bose wireless headphones (QC). This one paired immediately and worked well without any sound issues. It’s plugged into the headphone jack of our surround sound receiver (with an adapter) so I can watch TV with my headphones on.
5,This worked well as I delivered Fedex packages in TN and sometimes didn't receive a clear radio signal. It allowed me to configure different listening situations I actually got more in the product than originally purchased for glad it had many options! I think you would enjoy its size dependability and time between charges! I'm sure I'll use it on my new job...after I finish taking time away after the passing of Mom.(smile she's in Heaven!)
5,Extremely easy to use and hook up. I bought a bluetooth headset to go with this and they make a great pair. Now I won't kel my wife up at night watching tv in the bedroom. Added bonus.
5,I am using this item as a transmitter from my Kindle paperwhite (with the adaptor for the blind that reads the book aloud if you have a speaker) to my Bluetooth headset.  This was very simple: just plug in switch to transmitter and pair with my Bluetooth speaker.  It has pairing instructions included.  I am now listening to my Kindle on my Bluetooth Trekz Titanium Bluetooth headset.  I love this product!
2,I bought it to transmit my Nintendo Switch audio output so that I can pair it with my Apple airpods. I purchased it because someone on quora had recommended it for Nintendo Switch holders. But after I paired it with my airpods I can only hear intermittent sound from my airpods. I tried both of the aluminum adapter and the cable in the box but neither of them resolved the problem. My airpods works very well with my iPhoneXs computer and iPad. So I attribute this sound quality loss to this item. Now I will return it to amazon. In addition to the above this product is easy to handle with detailed instructions included. Maybe it works well with other device but not my Switch and Airpods.
4,Paired right away with my Bose headphones.  The volume could be better (doesn't play as loud as I would like) but has good range.
5,I have a MacMini and a wireless Bluetooth speaker. I bought the TROND Bluetooth transmitter to play my FLAC music files through my VOX player (and my MP3 music files through iTunes) to the wireless speaker as the MacMini has no Bluetooth out. The TROND works simply and perfectly exactly as described. The 3.5mm jack plugs into the Mac headphone jack and the TROND is powered via an open USB port on the Mac. I highly recommend this inexpensive product if you have a similar scenario.
5,I love this product because I can watch TV through my wireless earphones. I couldn’t pair it first then I emailed trond Customer service and I got very helpful instructions from Sonia on how to pair them.
4,Bought this one to replace a similar one from TaoTronics TT BA06 which failed after only about 3 months use.  It seems to connect to my speaker quicker than the TaoTronics one and appears to have a little bit better range.  Very satisfied so far.
5,I purchased two of these units to use in my motorhome. I wanted to use my radio ceiling speakers for tv shows and dvd movies.  However the tv and radio were older without bluetooth features.  I installed one Trond unit on the tv to transmission with the other on the radio aux to receive.  The pairing worked perfectly to give me sound throughout the motorhome.  NOTE: you must follow the pairing instructions EXACTLY to make the two units work.
5,The 5 star full pledge general rating is for package itself.once plug init takes maybe less than 10 sec to pair to my device.it is made from china but i know it built from a legal and a descent factory.not from the copycat or from fake things factory.1 STAR BRIG. GENERAL for the shipping..i ordered the package OCT 3 and just received it today OCT 13.I will Update soon after a year!
5,The product itself is good noticed no latency with two headphones connected. Sound quality is just as I could expect from any bluetooth enabled device.However the device has evidences of prior usage.UPD: the seller contacted me and said that the scratches were on protective films. I peeled them off and the surfaces beneath them were clean and clear.Great product and great seller! Thank you!
5,Use this with two headphones at the same time on an older flat screen TV.  No "sound out of sync" problems that I can detect.I recommend you devote a set of headphones to just this device else you'll probably just get mad linking it to this then your phone or tablet every time you want to switch the one you're using and they are all in the same room.
5,Recently purchased this item for use with my LG Harman/Kardon speaker headset and my TV.  Outstanding results!  My wife is also happy since I can watch TV while she's sleeping!  Happy wife happy life!Easy to set up just make sure all your other bluetooth devices are powered off which might also share or interfere with your listening device and ability to connect (all phones music receivers etc).  Makes it much simpler to set up lol.Great product!
2,I've tried multiple times and it will not connect to my car radio so I can Bluetooth music from my old iPod into the car stereo. I gave it to stars because it connects with my Bluetooth boombox just fine. So the unit is not defective.
2,I bought this transmitter as a replacement for Anker 2-in-1 3.5mm Bluetooth Audio Transmitter Receiver / Bluetooth andLantoo Bluetooth 4.0 Transmitter.Use: Streaming sound to Bluetooth sound bar from 15 feet away for use in viewing movies and video gamesResults: I had great results with this transmitter. It paired much easier than the Lantoo and lasted longer (the lantoo died after a month). The Anker also paired easily but because I am in an apartment and had major interference issues and a slight lag. The TROND device had very clear sound considering the number of bluetooth devices around me with absolutely no noticeable lag. Overall after several transmitters I am glad I found one that worked.Follow-up: After 6 months the transmitter stopped working. It was within the warranty period. Contacted the seller but never heard back.
5,I bought this to use with two sets of wireless Bose headphones simultaneously. I connect the TROND into my receiver (using a 1/4-in adapter) and then link the two headphones to the TROND. The only catch is that on occasion the headphones will not connect—though they are linked—the first time. I have to turn them off and back on again and then they connect immediately. The 40 ms lag is not noticeable even when watching movies with lots of close-ups.
4,Initially i had trouble configuring it with my Vizio TV and Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones but when i emailed the seller he sent all the instructions and i followed the same and got configured. Its really awesome.
2,This product worked acceptably for a while then stopped pairing with my Bluejay X headphones. I wanted to use it to watch TV at night allowing my partner to sleep. Like I said at first it seemed to work. Audio quality was OK not great but passable. There was a slight audio delay causing the picture and sound to be about a half second out of sync. (I'm a video editor so sync is something I deal with every day. I understand from a technical standpoint why this delay was introduced and don't fault the product for it.. For my purposes the delay was within acceptable limits.) I had to return it however when it suddenly stopped pairing with my headphones. One day I tried to use it as I normally would but they simply would not connect to each other.
4,It works very well in my trip no flaw to connect with my headphone work over 30000 feet high...Only thing not perfect is the battery cannot support a 14 hours flight when it is in charging you hear the electric noise.
5,This was a wonderful way to update the  bluetooth capabilities for a television that did not have bluetooth for the headphones.
4,This product has very low latency.  It's very easy to pair your device but if you pair more than one device connecting is a bit more confusing. Despite this I would recommend this product. I use it at the gym and on my Sony TV.
5,This is exactly what i needed and they perform perfectly with no lag or loss of quality sound.  I have an old pioneer stack system  on one end of the livingroom and wanted the ability to wire the flatscreen up for sound as well. No wires needed bought 2 of these works great and simple to connect!
5,Plugged it in pushed the button and it was paired.  I am using it to connect my Galaxy  S6 to an older Bose sound dock it works great.  I tried it on my TV with a set of Bluetooth headphones and there was very little lag to the point that unless I turned the volume on the TV up very loud so it could  be heard over the headphones it was totally unnoticeable and why would you ever do that?
5,I used to use this to transmit from my work computer that didn't have bluetooth to a bluetooth earpiece.I just realized that I could use its receiver mode to plug in earbuds. It works great for that or plugged into a non-bluetooth stereo amplifier.Like any bluetooth device it can be finicky. These one-button bluetooth devices can be a pain because you have to hold it for just the right amount of time.
1,I don't normally leave reviews but this product is a complete miss. I'm an electrical engineer for a FANG tech company and VERY technically inclined and I wouldn't recommend this product to my worst enemy.I fly a lot for work and after finally having upgraded my headphones to bluetooth decided I needed an accessory for longer flights. Enter the Trond... or so I thought.Pairing isn't super intuitive and you'll need to read the directions to be able to understand how pairing works. Not a huge deal. But you know what is a huge deal...? The fact that the bluetooth sound quality is atrocious. Drops static you can hear the inverter from the aircraft via the adapter. Volume is EXTREMELY low too.When I say don't buy... I really mean... don't buy. This isn't a headphones issue (I tried multiple devices). Maybe I got a dud but I don't think so.
5,These work perfectly to transmit form ATT Uverse box to Bose Hearphones.  Without noticable delay.  I need a more sound than the wife so I can hear the TV sound and the transmit sound from the Trond and although not apsolutely perfect match the delay only makes it sound like it is in a small tiled room.
5,My only concern is that the instructions imply that if you turn it off you may have to re-pair your remotes. I don't know.I keep it plugged in and headphones reconnect every time.Very small takes a USB plug for charging (wire included) and a 3.5mm output. No worries.
2,Device not doing what I had hoped. Tried connecting it to my portable CD player. Tried Bluetooth. No connection. Does it work similarly to the Belkin FM transmitter because with the Belkin I was able to connect the CD player to a certain radio station with no problem. Does the Trond do that?
5,Really impressed with the steps Trond has taken to ensure my satisfaction with their already great product.I purchased the Trond wireless transmitter/receiver so I can use my Bluetooth headphones while at work on my computer. This device is very easy to use and understand (took me less than 2 minutes to set up for the first time) and 2 clicks to get it set up thereafter.Writing this review to show appreciation for Trond and the great customer service they have provided.
5,Works great
5,Easy to pair great buy!
5,Bought this for some Blu-tooth ear buds but ended up using them for so much more.  Was able to connect to a PC and walk all over the house with great range.  My Android tablet and phone also worked great with these.  Very impressed with the battery life. Nice product.
5,I use this item for listening to the television while on my noisy exercise bike. Works very well and is simple to hook up.
5,Performs exactly as it was promised which left me pleasantly surprised as I usually don't have that kind of luck with such things. The accessories are all included and fit perfectly. Works like a little charm.
5,Wish it could send and receive simultaneously to use with my cell phone but it does mot.
5,I wanted to use an MP3 player that does not have Bluetooth capability with my Bose Soundlink mini without having the two cabled together. The Trond connected to the MP3 player allows me to do that and move the speaker around without fumbling with a cable. It was quick and easy to set up and works as described.
5,I am using Trond for music/GPS with my Harley Handlebar Speaker System & It works better than when i hard wire it to my phone.Its also saving the phone stereo plug which i had to replace because too many plug /unplug = it wears out/gets loose.Last week I forgot my Trond in my Jeans pocket & it went in to the Washer...it didn't survive. They were so cool about it & they are replacing it!!Thank you Trond & Trond people!!!
5,I purchased this because I have stay's in the hospital from time to time. It makes it convenient to plug into the TV and make it Bluetooth capable. I haven't done that yet but I did hook it up to my home cable box and it has worked great. I use it all the time. The sound is good the since is OK and the function's easy to lean. I would recommend this unit.
5,Not what I intended to buy it for. Originally for my surround system. That did not work. But I’m using it for my Nintendo Switch to get better sound out of it when I’m on the go. I use it to connect to my Bluetooth headset that I have for my phone. Works just as good for that.
5,I use this to make my ipod classic wireless works great for me. It's small enough that I can just tuck the ipod and the Trond in a pocket of my purse or work apron bluetooth earbuds on and I'm all set. Makes my gardening and housework go a lot faster. This was easy to pair some I tried weren't excellent directions with a lot of follow-up to make sure you have no problems. Highly recommend and would buy again from this seller.
5,Rechargeable battery has gone bad won’t hold a charge...less than 3 months of useMy fault.Intermittent charge cable. Changed the cable back in business.Battery life is very good.Sound quality is good.Range is very good.All in all.... a very good product.
3,the product is just okay.....I kept it becuse dont want to have to go through of the hasling of return it. I bought it becuse I thought it will be better than the one that I have from a competitor but it is not...it hust okay. It performed like it suppose to explain the 3 stars but the sound quality sending is not the best compare to anoher one that i have more than a year ago at lower price
4,I used this transmitter to pair with my TaoTronics TT-BH06 bt Stereo Sports Headset.One important to mention is that when doing so you must press the headset for > 8 seconds until you hear the announcement: "pairing" after "connected".
5,Thank you customer service for helping me set up this transmitter with my Bose stereo system.This is a great product a great customer service dept.. and now I can take my wireless speaker out to my pool and enjoy my tunes!!!!Bose did not offer me anything to accomplish what I wanted to do as my system is a bit old.You techies always find a way.
5,I used this product in RX mode for about a year and it worked as advertised. Then I tried the TX mode but  could not get the TX mode to transmit to two bluetooth devices at once.  I emailed the company and they supplied another device (different model) at no charge to me.  The new device worked perfectly.  Thanks!
4,Excellent sound quality initial pairing was troublesome but it WILL pair after a couple mins of working. Sound quality is superb compared to cheaper models. Battery life is roughly 6 hours of constant use after a full charge. I use this on my Harley. Love it!
3,Build seemed good Paired fine and signal was clear.  But I wanted to use it as a transmitter for an electric violin in order to play through headphones.  Very bad signal delay for this unusable.  This transmitter may be fine do just listening to music or movies but don't count on it where a rapid response is needed.  Returned.
5,Works better than expected. I use this to provide music and play audiobooks around the pool area using three UE Boom speakers in "Party Mode". Plays all day and into the evening on a single charge. I have an Anker USB charger ready to keep it going longer but have not needed it yet. At 30 feet there have been no audio dropouts or distortion and no volume issues. I highly recommend this.
4,It works pretty good  the only problem I've had was when leaning against a metal object that seems to disrupt the signal but aside from that good product.
4,The ONLY reason this received a 4 instead of 5 is because a 4.98 is not an option.  The 0.02 reduction is because the range could be better.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.
5,This is an excellent device but it was far too difficult for my 92 year old mom to navigate. I ended up returning it and buying a cheap 25ft cable and regular head phones.
5,Works great with my Galaxy s5 in my 2009 Rav4 that has no bluetooth. The sound is actually louder that when I connected my phone directly from the headphone jack to the aux port of the Rav4 with a cable. The Trond pairs with my device automatically when I turn it on. It shuts itself off when you turn vehicle off.I stream podcast and Amazon Prime music. Very happy with this product.
3,The reason for 3 stars is that it was fiendishly difficult to pair.  It would have been 2 stars but good support got another star. When it won't pair review your that procedure is correct then just keep trying over and over.  It took about 40 tries for me.  Once working it performs very well.  Even without low latency headphones the lip sync latency was unnoticeable where it had been quite obvious before this transmitter.
4,Works well.No issue paring very straightforward.The only issue. I recommend the connection drawing be modified for TV. Had to connect it to headphone jack on TV to hear on my Sony Bluetooth wireless Hphone
4,excellent product. a little slow in pairing but I like it.I have it connected to the headphone jack on my Sherwood 4508. I can listen to everything connected to the amp/receiver. Thanks.
5,Surpised by how much I like this device- installed in my 2009 Subaru Outback which just has an analog auxiliary input (no USB input for audio). This device coupled with a Maceton ground loop isolator which I would recommend for a car audio solution not only makes it more convenient to play tunes from my phone but makes the sound better too- or at least a bit louder which comes across as better. I'm real happy with this product.
5,Using it to Bluetooth my head set from our mixer at the church.
5,I like listening to audio tracks on my phone to fall asleep so I used this to convert an old pair of comfy earbuds into dedicated bedtime headphones. It works great frees up the charging port on my phone and I don't have to worry about the battery dying since it works while plugged in. I just mounted it to my headboard for easy access to the power button.
5,I have no phone reception at my office and I didn't want to use headphones with a cord.This made my laptop that didn't have Bluetooth work with my wireless headphones.
4,Haven't used it long but works great with xbox controller tv phone nintendo switch....great selection of cords to hook up most things.
5,Outstanding device. I had a need to convert my IPOD output to Bluetooth and also the ability to convert a Bluetooth to analog signal and this device  does both. It synced with all my phones tablets and speaker systems. No issues with connecting and once it has been connected the follow on is automatic. What surprised me most is the range. I got over 80 feet away from the Trondo and I still had a connection with my headset..
4,I really like this Bluetooth transmitter /receiver.  Occasionally it takes several tries to connect to my Bluetooth speaker when it's in TX mode. It always connects quickly in receiver mode. overall it's a great product.
5,I leave this plugged into my TV USB ports and headphone jack so I can watch stuff loud without disturbing our neighbors. Easy to connect two headsets to via BT. Can't speak on battery life since I keep it plugged in.
5,I was looking for a transmitter for my old iPod since it doesn't have Bluetooth features and wouldn't allow me to use it with Bluetooth headphones. This device did the trick. Easily paired with my Bluetooth headphones and put me in business. I can place both the iPod and transmitter in my backpack while listening to music through my Bluetooth headphones as opposed to be tethered to wired headphones. Love it. Highly recommended.
5,Works great. I bought this to replace another Bluetooth receiver that just died on me after a year of use. This has far better specs and the range for me has been twice as far as the old one. No complaints so far. The company stands behind their product with a 30 day return policy and a 18 month warranty. That definitely gives me peace of mind. I haven't had the opportunity to pair it with two devices yet though.
5,it simply works! paring with my Status Audio BT One headphones took seconds. plugged it into my VIZIO tv. Love this item! It charges while in use and the variety of cables included fit the need for quick set up !!
5,Came fully charged and ready to use. Very good range. I was out in garage about 50 feet away setting it up on my bike and  our smart TV picked up the signal and  was attempting to pair with it. I paired it with the Trond receiver and it's solid. Smaller than I expected which is a plus for me. Reciever will easily fit inside a full face helmet.
5,Extremely easy to set up. Worked as promised. Volume could be higher but not bad at all.Very pleased. I will see what the battery life is like.
5,Great gizmo! I use the Trond 2-in-1 Bluetooth transmitter/receiver with my hi-resolution PonoPlayer to send music to two yes two JBL Charge3 wireless speakers. The Trond is easy to use allowing me to enjoy gorgeous sound on the go. The directions were easy to follow and only required the use of a single button. Amazing that such a compact device could do such a big job so well. Bravo Trond!
5,I like how fast the Trond receiver was delivered. I had to wait for my head phone's to arrive before I could use the Trond receiver. Now I love it the sound is great and I can walk around and still hear every word using over the ear headphones.
5,I bought this device for my boyfriend he has went through 2 of a different brand in less than a year. So we decided to try a different brand of bluetooth devices and so far so good! worth the risk of switching to a better inexpensive item
4,Good way to add bluetooth to your car very small i just have it connected to my accessory plug and to my aux in my car never turn it off and battery alway last overnight just sitting there
4,This unit works perfectly aside from it continually beeps when the bluetooth source has powered down for too long. Was hoping to use it as an always on target for my phone in my bedroom but I can't because of the beeps.
4,Works well but the single button interface makes for changing the headsets a bit cumbersome sometimes it takes a couple of attempts to get the pairing done.
5,I’ve got all my music and playlists on an old iPod Classic. I’ve been using it on an old docking station/player for years but when that player died recently I struggled to find a way to access my iPod music. This Bluetooth transmitter made it easy to keep using my beloved old iPod. Now I can use it in conjunction with my Bluetooth speaker. Very cool!
5,Bought to allow me to bluetooth music from my phone in my car.  The Trond works perfectly.  It is so simple to connect and use and now I can drive with my favorite music blaring through the fantastic Mark Levinson Sound System in the 2007 Lexus.  Love it!
4,Product works well and is easy to use. I use it to transmitt from my stereo system to a portable blue tooth speaker on the deck. There is a distance limit of about 28 to 30 feet before signal fails.
5,This blue tooth xmt/recv works as described and is easy to set up.
3,I tried syncing 2 speakers together and one would always be slightly behind the other. Would not recommend for stereo sound. Note The speakers are the exact brand and model spaced roughly 50 feet apart.
5,Works great with my ipod Nano(that little square ipod)Sound quality and connection have been great.Battery lasts me 5 days at the gym 10 hours.I usually keep it next to me or inmy pocket.I have left it on my bag while working out and it was good from 20ft. Maybe 30.
5,Impressive little device!  Smaller than I imagined and it came with all the connecting cords one could want.  The directions are clear and it works as expected.  I like it!
4,Working great so far not the best audio quality in the world but definitely good enough for me. I use it to pair my old 120 gb iPod classic with my wireless headphones.
5,Very poor quality. Disappointed.Update: the first one was defected so seller sent the new one and it works perfect!
5,Flexible device with both transmitting and receiving capabilities.  Saved me from the Sisyphean task of trying to get the Bluetooth function that was supposedly built into my Windows O/S to work.  I use this device all the time with my equally awesome Bose headphones.  It could use a longer data cable but that's a minor complaint.
4,Se conecta fácilmente carga rápidamente. Pero la calidad del sonido no es la mejor.
5,Used it for an old iPod that did not have bluetooth. Works perfectly.
5,Works great I use it with my guitar and there is no lag!  I have a Fender Mustang GT amp and the headphones work great and I also use it to send backing tracks to the amp to play along with.  This also works great no lag.  This is the best bluetooth send/receive device if you want to use it with a guitar or other instrument.
5,This nifty little device has allowed me to switch my clunky oversized headphones that I formerly used to watch my television (so my roommate wouldn't be bothered) for a much sleeker lightweight pair of Bluetooth earbuds. The pairing was quite simple and went smoothly as per directions. I have absolutely no issues regarding connectivity or with overall latency. I am extremely pleased with this product and would recommend it without reservation.
5,bought this because I had one that had latency problems this is great! very reliable I use it with my turntable to broadcast my vinyl - my bose sound bar doesn't have enough inputs for it and I was tired of the jumbly old computer speaker system I had it playing through - works great use it often love it and its a great value.I wasn't paid or compensated in any way for this review
5,I bought this to replace an older unit that had given up the ghost after a couple of hard years out in the weather on my motorcycle. This unit connected immediately and the frustrating latency issues of the old unit are no longer a problem.Wonderful product.(I use it to capture the XM radio output of my Zumo 550 and send the music to my Sena unit on my helmet.)
4,The Trond 2-in-1 Bluetooth V4 works perfectly with my ipod classic. I have it paired with a wireless speaker I would certainly recommend to anyone looking to using a bluetooth speaker or headphones.
5,I bought this device to use with an iPod Video 5th generation and it works well! I've only used the transmitter function so far but it works like a charm for devices that don't have onboard Bluetooth.
3,This item works fine but when I first plugged it in the component board slid out of the casing and the switch mechanism fell out. Not a big deal as I simply put it back together and secured it with some Scotch tape but not exactly the most durable item I've ever seen....
5,With Trond I can stream commercial free music to my home stereo from my cell phone or laptop app with better than CD quality and no time delay utilizing the power of my 15 woofers and subwoofer. No Bluetooth speakers can compare to that and the price WOW! All by a company that backs it's product 100%. Thank you.
5,I purchased this Bluetooth Transmitter for a set of earphones the BT-DUO is one of the easiest to set up as far as IM concerned I like using the USB port to activate and use for power and to recharge the BT-DUO while I'm using it. onse I through watching TV I turn off the Ear phones and the BT-DUO.a great purchase and inexpensive.
1,The product advertises that it can connect two bluetooth speakers or headphones to the same audio source such as an iPhone iPod etc.  I purchased it because I wanted to connect my Bose Soundlink and Brookstone Big Blue speakers to my iPod.  I was never able to sync the speakers to the Trond.  It is a small and neat looking product but it did not work as advertised in my case and I'm sure there are a lot of speakers out there that won't work either.  I contacted customer support and all they did was send me a copy of the manual that I already had because it came in the package.  They said amazon has a 30 day return policy.  Unfortunately I live in Mexico City and there is no way I can get it back to them on time without paying an arm and a leg for shipping.  I suggest they publish a list of the speakers and headphones that are compatible with their product!
5,Works okay bad design. The plugin and USB power is on the same face which makes it practically impossible to plug into device
5,This thing works great. Have not tested it for super performance but it works flawless. I use this at my office with a wireless earplugs. Lets me be mobile and listen to my tunes/ radio/ whatever. I keep it plugged in charging all the time does not create any cross static being in use and plugged in to the power source. Super easy to connect. Flat out good design.
1,I was told by a Target employee to buy this but it's not compatible with BOSE headphones....at least not in any expected/usable way.  It worked once for a TV connection then didn't work again.  Basically there isn't any good product for TV to Headphone product out there YET.  Apple is getting close but we just have to wait.  BTW: This is one of two devices I was instructed to buy.  Neither worked.UPDATE: A company representative quickly responded to my initial review. He expressed concern and generosity. The company and I disagree on the best solution. I don’t feel that hunting through various customer website comments for advice is helpful for me. I should be clear that I had to hire professional help due to both my lack of tech knowledge (though improved) and my inability to make this contraption work. I sincerely appreciate the representative’s response he seems to want to help ANYONE with questions.....but I’m done until Apple gets it together. (They’re the closet to EASY)
4,Very pleased with this product. However it creates a 50Hz background noise when connected to an amplifier with turntable and in charging mode
5,This is a great product eapecially the fact that it can carry up to two bluetooth devices.  I use it for the DVD player in the car and instead of everyone having to listen to the DVD now the kids can just listen to it and I can listen to something else!  great product!
5,I was skeptical but it works as advertised and perfect.
1,My wife and I purchased the TROND BT DUO to connect two Bluetooth headsets to one iPhone.  We planned to share music for the NYC Marathon which we ran on Nov 6th.  Initiating the connections based on the directions is confusing.  The equivalent of trying to communicate in Morse Code.  It hard to believe there is not a one touch connection option for paring each headset.Furthermore each time the pairings are interrupted (for charging) the same complex pairing process needs to be renewed.  There is nothing sequential or simple about it.  After pairing at the start line (trial and error given the lack of clarity in the instructions) we were able to share audio for about 20 minutes.  I gave my wife the one functioning paired headset and ran the race without music.  A shame since we'd spent a lot of time on our music list and researching this option.  Bottom line:  don't buy the TROND BT DUO for pairing Bluetooth headsets to a single iPhone.  You'll regret it.
5,Product worked as advertised. Easily connected to my AirPod pros on plane.
3,Better than the others I tried that were supposedly the #1 Best Seller on Amazon. The only issue I have is if the song gets low and not transmitting that much it will cut out altogether. Again better than the others I tried where it would send me noise off and on.No it's not the headphones either. I give up trying to have wireless sound on my PC at this point.Overall easy to use.
5,Easy to connect. Press of just 1 button for transmission and 1 button to pair to Bluetooth headset.
5,I have only tried the "transmit" feature to this item but it has worked flawlessly.  I have used it constant for about 8 hours and it worked without a hitch.  I've only had it for about a week so I guess there is always the option it breaks or stops working - but so far so good.  Decent for what you pay for.  No complaints works as advertised.
5,works well on a minelab 1000 but puts out more sound on one ear. I think it's the minelab plug because works great on the tv
1,Let me start by saying I've been in IT for nearly 10yrs. So hooking this up should've been a no-brainer. I recieved this product today to hook up to my Nintendo Switch. Read the instructions to put it in pairing mode and low and behold none of my devices can even see this thing. I had an iPhone 8 Galaxy S10 Galaxy Buds Galaxy Watch LG TV and LG sound system all looking for it at different points in time. I made sure to even shut off all other devices but the one I was trying that particular time. All my devices have no issue on a daily basis instantly connecting to one another and I can seamlessly pair one to the next if need be. Not a single one could see this device in TX or RX mode. I tried resetting devices resetting the transmitter and all sorts of troubleshooting for over an hour.My opinion? Dont bother.
4,Ok.
5,Kind of sounds like the sound is off at times when there should only Be background noise and no one is talking during a movie but not all the time. Overall a great buy! Would definitely recommend.
5,It is easy to connect with the bluetooth headphone.  I can now use the bluetooth headphone to enjoy the videos on desktop and TV programs on TV.  And the sound syncs with the screen.
1,First let me say that I really wanted to like this product.  I hoped it was going to be my solution for using Bose Quiet Comfort 35 headphones on Windows 7. (you can research the problems with this combination if it interests you)  Sadly this just isn't a viable solution.  The product worked perfectly fine.  I was able to easily pair the Bluetooth connection just as described in the manual.  So what is the problem?The problem is that this product has VERY poor dynamic range.  What the heck is a dynamic range you might ask?  Lets just break it down in layman's terms.  Essentially if you connect this to a very good (almost audiophile grade) pair of headphones with excellent low end bass response the TROND will make them sound like a pair of $6 earbuds that you bought at the grocery store checkout aisle right next to the gum.  The sound simply has no fullness to it.
2,This transmitter/ receiver will not function while charging which makes it all but useless for many applications.  It's intended use as a short- term portable device would seem to make the process cumbersome as well.  I can't figure out why you would though as most devices that aren't wired to AC power nowadays have bluetooth built in.  I wanted to use this as a bridge to a bluetooth speaker I had set up across the room from a satellite radio due to reception problems but it is not reliable because of this problem.  Add to the fact that it has extreme difficulty connecting to my bluetooth devices and this is at best a two star item.  Waste of money for me at least.
5,PERFECT!I've tried so many bluetooth receivers and I can't believe this one was the best. Even compared to receivers 3x the price this one has better sound quality and amplification than all of them.My truck has an aux port which is notoriously low in volume. This receiver amplified the volume perfectly.Good work TROND. I've never heard of you before but I love your product.
5,Esta bienVoy hacer un nuevo comentario 21-10-2019 el personal de la empresa se puso en contacto conmigo para arreglar la dificultad que tenia con el producto solucionando lo  de manera absoluta. Quede gratamente impresionado no dudaría de comprar nuevamente esta marca ya que mi dinero esta seguro
5,I have an old (circa 2010) Yamaha amp that I wasn't using because I stream music & it didn't have bluetooth. With this simple solution now my old stereo is back up and running. Great product cheap price great solution for older hardware.
5,Good sound quality. Easy to set up. I love that it can be used while charging - but that's necessary because of its one flaw - pretty dismal battery life provides only 2-4 hours of music time. An accessory like this shouldn't have to compete with consoles and cell phones for those valuable overnight outlet spots every day.
5,Very easy to use
5,I am so happy that I am able to listen to my music from my ipod!! Having an ipod from the earlier generation without bluetooth was a struggle. But after some research and finally buying this transmitter in had no problem connecting to my bluetooth and listening to my music out loud!! Def recommend this!
5,WOW These are GREAT. If your not up on APTx it is a lossless compression! APT guarentees greater than 99% of your audio bits back at the receiving end!! My test hung a transmitter from a wall picture hanger got a solid 80' INSIDE my stations hallways in Stereo. At turn on mine take about a minute after power up to begin passing GREAT audio. I will be buying more of these rechargable units
5,It comes with all connections and adapters to make installation a breeze. Only had for a week but works great!
5,It does what I expected well.
5,So easy to set up connect everything about it was a breeze! I used it for a tv that does not have bluetooth I hooked up this little jewel turned it on a quick handshake and I was watching tv with my Bluetooth headset!!
2,I wanted to transmit audio from my mixer to a speaker system. However the latency is very long and on TV you see the lips moving and then half a second later you hear what he said. For music radio podcasts it's not a problem if you don't mind the echo.I've had trouble pairing it as well but I'm not sure if the fault is in this product or the receiver.  Seems you have to turn off the power and restart it and/or double tap the button.  Bluetooth doesn't seem to be very reliable but it is nice once you get it working.
5,Everything else works fine but I can set my watch on the fact that this device will drop dead after 2.5 hours of music playback to headphones.  It does not last 6 hours as the description states.  The seller then contacted me and sent another device that did work for 6 hours.  Very pleased!
1,Never worked with all the systems we tried. Do not purchase!
5,Finally a receiver that does not have static. This works great with my 1st gen Garmin Speak to connect to my radio. I can now enjoy it in my truck that does not have aux input.
4,Works as advertised with no issues what so ever will be purchasing at least 2 more to convert my non blue tooth devices into productive BT connections on both the TX Rx sides of the equation
4,The ease of hook up.
5,My wife needed something to use when she was riding her exercise bike and watching TVThis worked out well to do that
3,The sound SUCKS!! You can’t even turn volume up. It seems to be one volume. And I’m using Bose headphones with this. Another useless Amazon product. Sorry but not sorry. SMH again.
5,Easy to use fast connection. I use it to transmit music from my ipod classic to the new Sony GTK-XB7 and the sound comes of high quality. Very light and small makes it very portable and convenient to use. I don't like the cable connector so I separately ordered an RCA male to male connector without the cable in the middle this way it gets really fixed to the ipod instead of being hanging. Recommended product.
5,Exactly what i was looking for. I can switch from my old iPod Classic to TV with ease. Once the transmitter is synced with my blue tooth headphones I can simply disconnect my iPod and plug it right into my TV. Since the syncing is already complete i can go back and forth as i please without having to pair up each time.
4,Works fine after you watch a youtube video on how to set this up.  Not very good instructions by TROND.  Charge lasts pretty long.
5,Use it as a transmitter and it is great.  No notice of vocal delay.
5,I bought the TROND Bluetooth 4.2 headphones and this 2-In-1 transmitter/receiver on Prime Day. I wanted it for watching TV in the evening. I used to use an RF headphone but it has developed issues. Time for a new one. This is SO much better. No lag no cutting out because of a wall etc! So happy!
2,Although this device works and transmits audio that's far cleaner than other transmitters I've tried it has a couple flaws that I consider fatal. First I bought it specifically for the low-latency claim and it has very noticeable lag. Enough lag that the audio is so out of sync with the video as to be unwatchable. I'll admit that I'm very picky on this; even tiny sync problems that others around me don't even see drive me nuts. But that's not what I'm talking about here. This is *very* noticeable.Second it remembers no previous pairing! Every time you want to use it you have to go to wherever you have it installed and pair from scratch. Unacceptable design I'm afraid.
2,In the beginning things were pretty good. Sound quality was well above average but not superb. It paired and connected well most of the time. Volume was really good. After a couple of months however the volume is so low that it almost impossible to hear--even with the device volume maxed out. Listening to the same device at the same level with wired headphones or a different transmitter would make your ears bleed. Another case of "YGWYPF"
5,WORKS WELL WITH MY PODS ON MY COMPUTER
4,Works great for both of my headphones. Easy to hook up. Works great in my car for the kiddos. Saved my life by not having to listen to movies anymore.
5,4.5 stars.  Good device.  Make sure your bluetooth devices that you are pairing are recent.  I had an older bluetooth headset that didn't pair but my Beats did.  I borrowed another headset and me and my lady were able to stream a movie on the iPad to both of our headsets.  It held a charge during the whole 3.5 hour flight.
4,SO FAR IT'S WORKING OK. BUT NOW IT WILL NOT CONNECT TO THE Mpow Cheetah Bluetooth 4.1 Wireless Sport Headphones. I DONT KNOW IF IT'S THE HEADPHONES OR YOUR E-TROND. PLEASE ADVISE
4,Good unit easy to setup. I used this on my TLC tv for night time listening.
3,The device works great except when plugged in to charge. Then the audio just has constant static until is it unplugged. Best to turn the device off to charge but that is a frustrating limitation. My use of this device I hoped to leave it plugged in constantly.
2,I had this in receiver mode hooked up to a set of speakers and the sound quality was not too great. It sounded as though the range of frequencies was very limited. (Almost as if the sound was coming over a phone line.) Although a bit bummed at first the Trond customer support team remedied the issue by pointing me in the direction of the previous version of this transmitter/receiver. Once I tested out the BT-DUO S V4.1 the quality was much better. If you are looking to use this for music TV or movies I would recommend the 4.1 version.
5,I have a Samsung TV that does not have bluetooth. I have had several Bluetooth transmitters before and they work okay kind of fuzzy. This one is quick clear as a bell and easy to pair and turn on and off. Recommend!
5,This little unit works as advertised. The battery lasts a good 8 hours or so its hard for me to give a good accurate time on that as I use it in my car and I don't use it all day long. It was very easy to setup and they include extra adapters to hook up to various electronic devices. It is well made and I am very happy with the purchase.
5,I recently purchased a Nintendo 2DSXL and wanted to find a wireless solution for when I was using headphones. This works perfectly!I thought it would be a lot more difficult to pair with my AirPods but within 5 minutes of taking this out of the box I was paired and playing MarioKart.Definitely recommend.
5,I have been using this as a transmitter on a TV in our bathroom wall.  It is easy to use and the size is perfect!  I did have an issue after about 11 months and ended up receiving a replacement unit under warranty.  Very pleased.
2,The instructions say that you need headphones with the aptX codec to avoid noticeable latency so I ditched mine and bought another pair that fit the criteria. No dice. Still a lot of it. Volume cuts out at low volume.
5,We use this with our sound canceling headphones and it works great!
5,Great device to have when you want to watch a good movie and the kids are asleep. I love that the hubby and I can listen in and enjoy time together. A must.
5,I got this in order to pair with my blue tooth headphones (Tao-Tronics wireless 4.1 Bluetooth ear buds) in order to listen to my TV at night.  This allows me to watch TV without keeping anyone else awake.  The Trond transmitter was easy to set up and pair with my Bluetooth earbuds.  The sound quality is great and there is no noticeable lag between the audio and the TV.
5,Perfect size and as described
4,Used in combination with some BT headsets to run off of my TV.  Setup was simple and sound was great.  Have not noticed any sound delay that others have mentioned - very pleased :)
2,Can't get any earphones/headphones to pair with it and that is the whole point of buying it.
4,My wife and I have separate TV's to watch different programs.This is attached to the audio output on my TV and I use the Trond bluetooth headphones to hear the television.
5,high quality  very good
5,Use in my daily driver and have never had a problem. It actually works faster than most bluetooth for cars I have gotten into outside of having to manually turn it on for us(everytime). No noise feed back either.
5,Had this only for a couple of uses but it's worked great so far with my earbuds by Dre.  Easy to set up if you read the directions.  Cannot comment over fidelity I just use it for AM radio sports.
5,The TROND Bluetooth receiver/transmitter works great. Good sound quality very easy to connect to and it's SO INCREDIBLY LIGHT. The kit comes with all the cables and plugs you need even RCA plugs.Their customer service was quick and easy to deal with when I had a question.
4,use for making wired headphones wirelessand receiver rx wireless(via aux jacks) or tx wireless- via the headphone jack!  Note unit is plastic construction and fragile - handle with care!
5,I love being able to watch TV then walk around the house and not miss what's being said.I will agree with some reviews who stated that there is still a slight delay / latency in the audio.  The TROND manual said that there will still be some delay but it's not too noticeable.  If you want NO latency then use wired headphones!
4,Great Low Latency device. Customer support great. great price and value.
4,It does not work with my Cell phone enabled (Android) Bose headphones. While I am able to listen to audio just fine I cannot use the inline mic with this product.
5,Works great on a plane (12-14 hours to Asia) when you want to use your comfortable headphones but no wires to tie you down!  It did last about 5 hours so it holds up.  I have it inside the carrying case with my headphones (Audio Technica ATH-M50x) so this is a very small unit.
5,We started doing a ton of Video in early 2019 and had issues with audio interference i.e. wind etc. Theses Rat Mics solved the problem.
3,This was supposed to be able to use two speakers at the same time which is why I bought it.  I discovered the signal is not spontaneous and does not sync.  There is an echo with two speakers on at the same time which negates the entire reason for using  it!
4,I have been using this product for about four months.  It works well with several different bluetooth speakers.  When I had a question tech support was quick and very helpful.
5,This bluetooth device works perfectly for either transmitting or receiving. I wanted a clean broadcast in AptX LL to my AptX capable headphones and this fit the bill without issue. Pairing is simple and the connection was strong in range (maybe 25 feet indoors with walls between). Also worked as a receiver from phone to car aux input just fine. Good quality would buy again if I need another.
4,Nice product!
5,Paired easily to both my Jabra and Bose headphones. Now I can listen to my work computer and old iPods without the wires.
5,Works as product is described.  It shows up in a nice box.  It has product literature with it.  Very happy.I haven't tested the battery life.  I keep it plugged in.
5,A little confusing on the directions the first time you read and not much to indicate it is paired but man it does work well and I can broadcast well over 30 feet. The battery lasts for hours when used I would say at least 12 full hours solid
5,I love it! The only thing is it was hard trying to connect it to my sisters phone. I realized I had to disconnect my phone first 😂
3,It is very complicated to connect two headphonesand every time it is a bit of a hassle.Not sure it was worth it
5,I was scrambling at the last minute because I bought a projector that did not connect to our speaker system. This worked perfectly and there was no delay. We were watching an outdoor movie so I was worried about the audio and video sync. No issues.
5,This receiver/transmitter is amazing!I love it this is the second one I got and it performs greatly as the first one.If I need a third one I would order exactly the same.
5,I have used this for both playing music on my old Bose in the kitchen and for listening to the TV through some Bluetooth headphones while my wife was sleeping.  Everything works well once you get used to the pairing process.
5,Well.. This product works excellent.. I combined it with two sengled SOLO smart bulbs and now I can play the same music in both lights.. Now my music is in two places of the house..TROND2 is very easy to use it is small it has a nice design.. I liked it very much
5,Works great to link my television to my outdoor speakers by the pool and my patio speakers. Set up was easy. Range is great my speakers are approx. 75ft. away. For the cost I can't think of a better way to create the audio environment I wanted. Last but not least TROND contacted me to assure I didn't have any problems with set-up and answered some technical question concerning audio delay.
5,Used to connect a TV to Sony headphones.  Simple.
3,Simple connectivity  Easy pairing. clear audio.  Surprisingly Notable delay but this was at slowest connection where source audio was audible at same time as transmitted audio.
5,Works as advertised and is smaller than anticipated.  Seller sent a very helpful unsolicited email describing initial operation and pairing.  The printed instructions that come with the unit are in a very small font and were difficult for me to read.  I also appreciated the inclusion of both a mini stereo jack and an RCA adapter for those TVs like mine without a headphone outlet.
5,Love this device  I have two likely will add to that.  I use one as a receiver on a powered speaker setup in my workshop...using my Samsung S5 as the transmitter.  Perfect.  I use number 2 through a guitar amp connected to the headphone jack set as transmitter to a wireless headset. Perfect.  Best I've used.
5,The eTROND works just as it says. I am completely happy with this purchase. I love how I can both transmit and receive in one small unit. Once you pair it with your listening device (headphones) you can plug the eTROND in any output device and it will play to your listening device.  Output devices include: ipod cassette player computer CD player TV whatever. AWESOME! Get one. You can thank me later.
5,This device doesn’t has volume control. But it’s a really good solution to connect a laptop with Bluetooth devices (in my case earbuds).
5,Really good product for people like me that aren’t so teck savy. Does a wonderful job I’m using this in conjunction with an older BOSE stereo it’s just what I’ve been looking for really great sound and I can do stuff on my phone without having to physically connect the two units. Just Wonderful! Well done Trond
5,We had trouble paring with a head set until we read the directions.  We are older so we don't understand a lot when it comes to electronics.  The directions are easy to follow.  I wish it would charge itself from the TV.  We bought 2 so we charge one while using the other.
3,I have only used it a couple of time on the airplane and it does work however the lag (delay) makes it hard to watch a movie.
5,I can't post how many stars on durability yet because I do not have the device long enough to know. But the device looks solid. well finished. No problem with sound or connection. you do need to follow the instruction on the initial setup of Bluetooth and you will be OK.
5,Great product! I bought this so I could use my Bose QC30s on a long haul flight. They paired easily using the instructions provided (be sure to unpair the earbuds from your phone first). Worked like a charm with the airline entertainment system headphone jack and I could watch movies quite easily.
5,I bought this to use my Bluetooth headset with my Nintendo Switch and tied with a velcro touch on the back. It was super easy to use and pair simply done with this device and also my headphones. They work like a charm and now I can play games easily on my Switch.Great device. I completely recommend it.
5,I received my order right on time and it was super easy to set up with my Yamaha sound system that was not Bluetooth enabled.  This allowed me to play my Bluetooth  mp3 player through my system from a distance as I am giving lessons.Thanks for a simply great product!
4,company came out with a new product and was great with helping correct the issue.sound is really in sync.
3,You must turn off all other Bluetooth devices before you try to pair this device. Once everything is turned off thr pairing is pretty easy.
5,This turned out to be everything I hoped it would be.  I needed to send sound from my aux out to my Bluetooth speaker. Pairing was easy. The unit is very small and very well designed.  Sound is great. Battery life is excellent.
5,It works as advertised if set up properly.  In my haste I overlooked a step and it would not connect to the headphones.  I email tech support and within a very short time received a response with detailed instructions on what I was doing wrong.  Once corrected the device works as advertised.
5,Ease of handling and compact size.
5,Love this especially on the economy SAS flights I'm usually on. Seats so small it's nearly impossible to watch something on the ipad or computer. This dongle makes it super easy to use the IFE system. Simple setup even when bleary from intl travel. Battery lasts the whole flight easily.
5,This device is smaller than my previous TROND.  Very easy to setup and run.
5,As a new bluetooth user It took 3 tries for me to successfully pair the TROND with my BOSE speaker. The people at TROND were very helpful both times i called with questions.  I recommend the TROND 2-in-1 both for it's performance which is excellent quality and for the ease of setup.
5,There is another nearly identical item on Amazon but it does not work with the Bose mini SOUNDLINK 2. Get this one! Perfect for everything.
4,Works to connect the my AV receiver (with 1/4" to 3.5mm adaptor) to my Apple AirPods.
4,Works great easy to connect just follow the instructions and you should not have any problems
2,I bought this because it is the only BT with aptx I could find and the reviews were (suspiciously) good .  Unfortunately there is still noticeable delay from multiple sources (not even better than the Sony SBH20 which they were to replace).  Also the high pitched beeps it makes when it is powering on or the battery is low are almost painful.  They are really annoying with earbuds. There is also no way to pause playback or adjust the volume from the unit.  So yeah I would pass.  I just wish someone would make a decent bluetooth headphone adapter but even Sony has apparently quit the game.
1,Bought this to use so my daughter could listen to TV using her headphones. We have no problem pairing them to our Samsung TV iPad or iPhone. However when trying to pair her headset or my wife's headset to the Trond BT device they just would not pair. Spent an hour following the instructions multiple times and like many others it seems the device just refuses to pair with certain headsets. Disappointing since this somehow had so many good reviews returning for a refund and will try a more expensive and better device.
5,I've tried two of these devices now this one is fast superior (though it did cost slightly more). It feels mechanically robust and remembers Bluetooth settings (meaning when it wakes up it had reconnected every time to my headphones). Very pleased!
5,Worked as described. Paired up as directed with bluetooth headphones. Wich it would have had a longer input cable. I purchased an extension for the line input. Now I don't have to reach or look behind TV to determine status. Pretty much a set it and forget it type of application. Once I turn my headphones on it pairs right up with no need for reprograming
5,EXECCELENT PRODUCT. NO DELAY
4,This is a great device easy to connect to my non-bluetooth computer.The price is fair fast service.I'll be back to order another.
3,After a hour of trying I got it connected and it works. The instructions should be better. Would I buy it again no.
5,I use the Trond BT adapter during flights so I can connect my Bluetooth wireless headset to the airplane video system.  Works great with no delay in sound.  Highly recommend if you travel on long flights with your wireless headphones.
1,I have spent over 2 hours trying to connect two different Bluetooth headphones to the device! once connected the sound quality horrible plus it was cutting in and out! I would stay clear from this product.
5,Plugged into Ipod Classic headphone jack with switch in TX mode. turned on a/v system. Press play. everything's on. Yes! works great! just made my Ipod classic wireless.
5,I’ve used it for about a month so far and I love this little device.  I pair it with Avantree headphones and my iPhone fast and easy.  I use it in my car my pc and home stereo.  Works great very happy with it.
5,Great item  clear audio . Works great with my 6s plus . No problems with my bmw connected with this
5,I bought this to transmit audio from my bedroom TV to a shower speaker via Bluetooth.  As a very non-techy person I expected this to be a frustrating and challenging connection.  After charging the transmitter and the speaker it was a piece of cake.  Very easy set up and the signal is very fast.  Highly recommended product!
5,Marvelous simply Marvelous. This is what I have been looking for on both affordablity and quality. This little gem performs magically and with such ease that it seems too simple ;Push button and listen. I walked outside to check for sound lag and found NONEXISTENT. Thanks for your prompt delivery and this awesome little jewel.Shalom 🙏🏽❤️
5,TV
5,I've used it for both transmitting from a TV to a Bluetooth speaker as well as a receiver from my iPhone to a Bose Wave system.  It holds the connection well. I don't hear any skipping.  I'll also try it in the car...I might just have to get another one!  Much better than another brand I had before this one.  (It got hit by lightning)
5,Works great! I plug it into the headphone jack on my TV and connect a Bluetooth headset and it sounds clear and has very good range. My wife doesn't have to hear the TV at night :)  I also like that Trond Customer care sent an email after purchase with warranty info and email address if I had any concerns.
4,Cool device... Connects easily range is excellent and as promised two Bluetooth headsets connect simultaneously. All in all at an excellent gadget with good build quality...
4,Not sure why or if other models are this way but can't operate while being charged has left me tune-less too many times.. otherwise super strong and clear signal
5,Finally a device that allows my boyfriend to heAr the tv in headphones so I can have peace and quiet.  Amazing !
5,Very easy Bluetooth connectivity crystal clear audio sound quality strongly recommend it to anyone want a Bluetooth transmitter and receiver.
5,works just fine and was easy to use.
5,Fast delivery. Easy to set up. Sound quality is great. I have it paired with my Bose headphones. Sounds great. I’m going to order another one so that I can keep them connected to multiple devices without moving it back and forth.
5,I received an updated instructions on how to program this an after several tries I got it to work . Good customer service
5,Got for my mom for Xmas and she's using it with a pair of Bose wireless headphones; she uses it with her TV and she loves it. There is no noticeable latency which was my big concern based on other reviews since I'm sensitive to latency when it happens and 200-500ms latency would be unacceptable.
5,This thing is terrific! Works exactly as expected. Battery life is decent enough it works for about 5-6 hours. Lightweight and charges quickly. Bluetooth connects easily. Great for the price.
5,We use it in the rv to provide privacy to the others and it works fantastic
4,seems to connect to my Nintendo Switch very well. I noticed very little latency problems so far. Good buy!
5,this has very good clear sound and no noticeable delay for videos. it feels like its make with good material. connecting with my soundbar took a few trys but it worked.
5,Got this to hook up to my old skool RCA radio with a SirusXm radio hooked up. Works great! I leave it plugged in to a USB adapter to supply power and it's transmitting to a Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker. I like the fact that it sends 2 Bluetooth signals I may get another speaker.
5,Great product easy Bluetooth connectivity and sounds quality
5,I have an artic pro wireless and being able to talk to my friends and watch videos while having my switch audio is important and this product works great for that. Its a little confusing to set up but its pretty much a non-issue
5,I am currently using this device to watch TV wirelessly. I've used it with two different BT headphones/earbuds. I really purchased it to be able to use my wireless BT earbuds in Israel with a personal listening device used by our tour guide. So far the Tr distance is very good and the quality is excellent. The latency is excellent as well.
5,I travel a lot on airplanes.  I have tried a couple of these to keep my headphones wireless to the screen on the back of the seat.  This one works the best by far.  Easy to pair good sound quality good range.
5,I've only used this as a transmitter but it works perfectly for my use.  I'm using it to transmit the sound from my Pioneer Elite VSX-43 to a pair of BT headphones in our open concept home. Easy to pair no sound lag great distance small nicely made device with great sound quality. Much more economical than the overpriced Pioneer adapter.
5,Delivered on time works just as described. Haven't tried connecting it to two bluetooth earphones or such yet. Don't  know about battery life yet but its lasted through several Netflix shows.
5,Works great very easy to set up and the battery lasts a couple of days. I use it about 5 hour a day on the T.V. Very small takes up very little room.
5,I am using this with the Trond Bluetooth headphones and it works really well. Pairs up within seconds and the sound quality is really great also. The only thing i would have liked would have been for the battery life to be a little longer.
5,Works great has no noise or hum when not charging. Just a little buzz when charging (you can fix this with a ground loop isolator found onAmazon for 6$). Transmits well and lip sync is so good I had to turn down my audio delay from my video player to 100ms (note: you need a AptX capable headset to use this feature). Highly recommend.
5,Connected headphone jack on amplifier to Bluetooth headphones
4,everything works great except the battery length. I wish that the battery lasted longer. it seems to only last about 3 hours at most.
5,Worked perfectly.  Followed instructions.  Plugged into my headphone jack on my large screen TV and linked with my wireless headphone set.  Presto!  Great sound and good comfort while I'm riding on my indoor bicycle trainer.  Easy to carre for; just wipe off with a moist towelette.  I use the volume control on the TV.
5,This unit works beautifully as described. However I did run into trouble when I wanted to pair it with a different spkr. I contacted the seller and they couldn't have been more helpful. They told me what to do and voila problem solved. I am 82 and a newbe as well so their very generous and courteous help was much appreciated.
5,In receiver mode the Trond is exactly what I needed to bluetooth  to a guitar amplifier aux input.Easy to use and compact.Have not used the transmit feature yet.
5,Great gadget
5,This unit replaces one from another company that I purchased a year ago. This one is much better. No problem connecting. I've only used it in the receive mode.
4,Seems to work as advertised with the TROD Wireless Bluetooth to transmit the sound with very little latency.
5,Excellent device for a very reasonable price. I use it to connect my iPhone to my Bowers & Wilkins MM-1 speakers and it works like a charm.
5,Easy to use and work well.  Can use with TV with no noticeable delay if paired with each other.
3,I truly appreciate the extended help by Bruce to assist me in pairing the Trond with my 2018 Honda CR-V EX-L. Howeverafter numerous attempts I have been unsuccessful and have decided to go another route other than Bluetooth. Thanks very much.
5,Fantastic product. I bout this so my wife and I could both watch the same movie on my iPad using our on AirPods. After connecting each set of the AirPods to the Trond it worked perfectly. Neither of us had any latency whatsoever! Highly recommended.
2,The description says APT-X low latency transmitter but it did not transmit at that level for me. It's possible this is an Amazon mistake; sometimes old models get delivered instead of the updated one. Or maybe I misunderstood the barely translated instructions but be warned.As for the unit itself... It's very small which can be good but I think it hurt its range. I didn't want to drain the battery so I always had it plugged in but that gave too much feedback (loud hissing). Not plugged into power I could see this working great as a transmitter in a car or as a portable Bluetooth receiver for your non-wireless headphones.
4,I connected by bluetooth my TV and ceiling speakers but I can not control the volume.
5,Looks and feels like quality. Pairing was easy sound quality is excellent. Latency is... ok. I had to adjust the lip sync feature on my tv to get it right. I'm using headphones with the low latency codec so there should be no issues there. I just can't really tell a difference between this and bluetooth 4.0.
4,Me gustó mucho muy fácil de usar
5,Does exactly what I bought it for. The controls are simple and were confusing for connectivity at first but I got it.
5,I'm using this with the Bose Qc35 wireless headset.  It paired really easy.  The sound was good and became much better when I replaced the included stereo plug with FiiO L17 2.2" Professional 3.5mm Stereo Audio Cable with L-Shaped Plugs. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R9WAYC6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  It made the sound even richer.  I paid full price and did not receive a discount for my testimony.
5,Everything I needed for a good price. Volume a little lower so I just turn it up louder. I live in the country. About as fast as planing and going to store. Ordered on Sat. and received on Monday.
5,Works well for pairing two different headsets to one device. Make sure to turn off the Bluetooth function on your phone/tablet first. Seems obvious but I forgot to do this and your headsets will not connect to trond if it is on.
5,Trond provided courteous quick customer service. I shot off an email requesting a PDF copy of their instructions because the card included with the device had very small print. I received a prompt reply with the PDF attached. In addition their customer service followed up with other questions I had.  Device works as described  and is easy to operate.
5,Need ir for my car. It works great!
3,I wanted this to listen to my bass guitar played through an amp but there's a delay in the transmission of the sound. This delay makes in impossible to hear the bass in real time as I'm playing and consequently unusable for my application.It did pair easily and worked fine for streaming music.
2,I was hoping that this device would pair with my Harman/Kardon Onyx Studio Bluetooth speaker. Needless to say it did not. Very disappointed.
5,I Purchased the Tron two in one to plug into  my laptop which does not have Bluetooth .  It will apiece flawlessly in seconds  with my wireless speakers it doesn’t seem to have any lag watching videos while using speaker .  My recommendation is buy it .
5,Charged it up plugged it into the coax audio out on the back of my TV. It paired with my new Bludio Wireless earphones in seconds. Great sound. I highly recommend this product. I Don't know if it is mentioned in the product description that it also comes with Red/White RCA out to coax splitter if you don't have a coax audio out.
1,Stopped working a week after the return window closed utter junk
3,There is a slight but noticeable time delay on the sound. I wanted it for sound with a movie projector but it gets a little out of sync with the picture.
5,Happy with them. Its a little tricky connecting 2 together only because there is no display as you would have on your phone or tablet. It does work you just have to keep at it if it does not connect quickly. Repeat the steps until it connects when it does you will hear sound from the receiving end.
5,I use it with my Nintendo switch for wireless audio. No noticeable latency and pretty good quality audio. I do notice the sound dip out if the game is too quiet but mostly only when I am in menus. Works great otherwise and has a good battery life.
5,i was looking for affordable Blooth tooth tranmitter to link with my Tao heard set...the tron bt-duo is the one i picked.  works great so i can watch movies etc and not bother the household.  had an issue with pairing and contacted the company.  they responded quicky...issue resolved.  i would recommed.
5,Great adapter that I use for pretty much everything. Even my Nintendo Switch. Excellent battery life good quality sound and the build quality is also excellent.
5,Works great! Wireless headphones 🎧 were easily set up.
5,I bought this to connect earbuds to my home stereo and it works great.  There is a little latency but it's not bad.
5,I purchased this item to pair with my iPod classic and Bose soundlink. The process took much less time than anticipated and went seamlessly. The sound quality is not quite as good as when pairing my iPod nano directly with the Bose but certainly is good quality. I recommended it to my daughter who plans on getting one for her iPod classic.
5,Took me couple of minutes to figure out but it works great. Now i can use with my bluetooth
4,The transmitting feature is good but I am still testing the receiving feature. Hope that it can work for my desktop.
5,I got these for my non-bluetooth mp3 player so that I can use them with my new wireless earbud headphones. It is very small and very easy to use. The battery life is very good too.
5,Works perfectly. Just what I needed. I bought it to watch TV and listen with my noice canselling bluetooth headset but now I find me using it at my computer at work and home listening to music and being able to move freely around. I might have to buy another one. :)
3,I really wish that it would come on when powered; it's annoying that I have to open my armrest and hold the button down everytime I get in the car.  But the audio quality is great and it connects very fast to my Nexus 5x and 6P.
5,Works great!  I had some difficulty trying to figure out where it get connected on the TV.  Hopefully this photo can clear it up for other people.  I do wish the support for this product had a phone.  The only way to communicate is over email.  But..at least they email promptly.
5,This worked great for my iPhone 7 and my 2010 Honda Odyssey.  I used to plug my mobile to the Aux cable but with the lack of a headphone jack on my iPhone 7 this device has brought my music back online in my minivan!  This works great and is perfect for the iPhone 7
4,Great product
5,Works great on my tv. No lapse or lag in the dialog. paired perfectly with my LG Tone bluetooth earphones. I love it.
5,I really like the fact that you don't have to reconnect when using it on TV. Automatic reconnection.No problems setting it up.  Makes my Old Powered speakers Bluetooth.  Wow!Small you can take it with you if you need it for somewhere else.
5,Nice product. Appears to be well made. Does everything it is supposed to. With an additional receiver I can listen to my iPod inside (stereo)and outside (docking station). Or listen to my stereo inside and outside. Just don't go too far apart or the signal may get lost (~30 ft with wall/window). Using it for about a month with no issues.
5,This is my second bluetooth receiver / adapter.  The sound quality coming through my car stereo is noticeably better than my previous adapter. Only gripe is that the device does not automatically shut off after losing the connection.  So manually turning the unit on and off every time I get in and out of the car is bit tedious.
5,I use the TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter Receiver to connect my Garmin GPS to a Anker Bluetooth  speaker and it works perfect. Driving a convertible there is no way to hear the announcements trough the build in Garmin speaker. With this setup I can hear the directions loud and clear even at higher speed.
5,this signal transfer device is a great little unit for jbl head phones and night t.v. watching while in bed with no interution to my spouses sleep
5,This works great.  I ordered and returned a few different brands before I found this one.  The range is great does not cut out and no humming noise that i would get from the others.  I use it for my bedroom home entertainment system so my wife can sleep while I watch TV.  I highly recommend this.
5,I bought this to be able to use a bluetooth sound bar with my LED Video Projector.  It is a tiny little device but works fantastic and was effortess to set up.  no issues and comes with all cables needed. for multiple options.
1,TaoTronics Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter and Receiver 2-in-1 Wireless 3.5mm Adapter (aptX Low Latency 2 Devices Simultaneously for TV/Home Sound System)        Pairs easy. I noticed no latency. The problem with this is the quality of sound. very little high end and the rest sounds like mud. I compared this side by side with a Logitech device:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IQBSW28/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1The Logitech sounds great feels well built and was 10 bucks cheaper. The Trond sounds like chowdered excrement and will be going to the landfill.Also this appears to be a rebranded Taotronic device (and prob a few other brands as well):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EHSX28M?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=SHBHRHH8X1XY1VY60SSXI have noticed this trend with a lot of Chinese  electronics and am more than a little annoyed as it is a deceptive marketing practice.  Buyer beware.
5,I use this while watching TV with an Onkyo receiver and Beats Studio 2 headphones.  The sound is great no noticeable latency and crystal clear.  The battery life is decent as well.  I have only used this in transmitter mode so can’t comment on the receiver functionality.
5,Our older Samsung didn't have Wifi and I am not a computer genius but I ordered this transmitter and use it with a speaker beside my chair and now I don't have to crank up the volume and I can understand what is being said on the TV.  Easy set up and a money saver.
5,Buenisimo... excelente lo recomiendo totalmente
4,I bought this item to use to connect Wireless headphones to my television.  I have been very happy with the results.
5,Out of the box it did not worked and seemed like a used item. I want my money back.UPDATE:TROND Staff contacted me and send me a new unit that was working as a charm. Also they politely apologize.Thank you!
5,I like it.
1,The badly designed shape of the ear buds has them fall out of your ear regularly. One of the two ear buds that I unfortunately purchased suddenly went silent a week into my use. It takes a long time and a monumental effort to get the ear buds to pair with any device. I DO NOT recommend buying this garbage.
5,I use the TROND blutooth transmitter to send audio from my TV to a pair of bluetooth wireless Jaybird earbuds. It is very easy to setup; I put the Jaybird earbuds in pairing mode then put the the TROND in pairing mode and in a few seconds they are connected.
5,Great product easy and fast connection
5,Bought this to use in my 2011 Ram with the stock radio. Works as it should and comes with everything you need. Sound quality is just as good as using an audio cable.
4,Fairly priced works as advertised.  Clear instructions included.  Can't give anything 5 stars because nothing is perfect.But if I could I would.
2,Would not connect with Apple Airbuds.  Tried many times and it failed.  Would sometimes connect and then fall off.  Returned and got Avantree Oasis which cost more but has a talking feature which lets you know it's connected.  Works great.
5,I am happy with my purchase of the TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter Receiver. Arrived well packed on time and I experienced no issues pairing it with my Sangean WR-50P FM-RBDS/AM/Bluetooth Wood Cabinet Table Top Stereo Digital Receiver System. Useful for connecting my computer's audio out jack to the receiver for a rich listening experience
5,We go to the gym and work out on the treadmill which has a headphone jack to listen to the TVs and we hated the wired earbuds and this device worked like a charm I am thinking about buying another one.
1,I watch tv in bed which interferes with my wife's sleep so I came up with the idea of a Bluetooth transmitter attached to the TV with a small BT speaker next to my side of the bed. In theory this is a great idea however THIS transmitter is not right for the job. There is a 1-2 second delay (lag ... latency) between the TV and the speaker. This results in the action on the screen (like actors speaking) being out of sync with the sound. Makes everything look like a poorly dubbed movie. If you are going to use this to listen to music well I guess it is ok for that but if ANY synchronization between the transmitter and receiver is required. FORGET THIS DEVICE...THE LAG (LATENCY) RENDERS IT USELESS.
1,I want to love this but it doesn't work right.I can connect with 2 bluetooth headsets but when they both transmit audio it cuts in and out on one of the devices.  I've attempted to reset/repair them and even went as far as to buy 2 brand new Plantronics M70 headsets to ensure that it was not the bluetooth device and it still cuts in and out.  Maybe I got a dud and just need a new one.  It partially works but not enough and I'm not a happy camper.  Please help Trond!***Update***Trond did not of course help and this transmitter is a big piece of China junk.  It does not at all transmit to 2 devices at the same time even if within 2 feet.  It was working at first but now it's crap.  Buyer beware and stay away from this.
5,This is an amazing Widget!!!  Battery last a very long time. I own three now and couldn't live with out them!
1,I got this as a Bluetooth hub for my tv. I intended to use my Bose speakers as tv speakers.This item does not pair with the speakers lol.
5,This is the best BT device I've ever owned. I can get 30' away and it still has no problems keeping connection in rx mode. Haven't had the need to use as transmitter.   TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter Receiver / Wireless 3.5mm Audio Adapter (aptX Low Latency for Both TX and RX 2 Devices Simultaneously)        ..
5,I have bee using this for some months now it easy paired with my cell head set LOVE it I leave it pluged up if I wish to move it I do on it's battery life best I have found so thankful
5,Great product... I use it with a set of computer speakers (including a sub-woofer). I have a number of devices I wanted to use the speakers with a desktop Chromebook Samsung Dex tablets etc it works with all of them. There is no lag they sync and sound great!
5,I wanted to couple 2 pairs of headphones to my ipad. This did not work  I read about this product and miraculously it works!!! It is necessary to follow the instructions exactly as written but it worked the first time! Keep the instructions booklet!!
4,Good stuff! No latency.  Love the product just what I was looking for. Thinking of buying another for my son.
5,Small and unobtrusive.  Works as advertised.  I had no problems connecting it to TV's RCA analog-out jacks and then sending signal to Nakamichi BTHP02 headphones.  Easily pairs and reconnects to headphones once they are turned on.Note that it does not include power adapter - only the standard USB-A to Micro-USB cable.
5,This product works as advertised
5,Absolutely what I was looking for! Bluetooth transmitter for my Nintendo Switch so I could pair my Switch with my Beats and it works perfectly!!! Highly recommend this to anybody that wants to pair their Switch with bluetooth headphones/speakers!
5,Connected quickly using it to play my analog turntable on my Polk Command Soundbar. Fantastic! Great customer service after trying one transmitter that was faulty. They sent me a 2nd one free of charge! Thanks Trond!
5,This is an awesome device I was extremely shocked by the quality honestly better than my aux cable and it's louder. I drive a z4 35i and it doesn't allow me to stream music and I have my.phone connected to both my radio for telephone and this device to stream music very happy with it and recommend it
5,could not have asked for any thing better. it works great. very pleased
5,Works well plays sound just fine. In order to pair 2 Bluetooth headphones the headphones need to be out of range of other Bluetooth devices they connect to to avoid hassles. Once both are paired works just as it should no issues. Battery life is very good.
5,I used it to add Bluetooth capability  to my 10 years old TV. Set up was easy just follow the directions in the manual.
5,Bought this so I could play music from my iPhone in my Jeep and still charge it.  Works great the sound is even better than I would have thought
5,This thing is so awesome. I've only used it in receiver mode to connect my phone to some older speakers but it works like a charm. Set up is super easy it stays connected and it has really great range. Highly recommended.
5,Great and it works like stated. When I had issues with my transmitter I emailed customer service and received a prompt response and help in resolving my issues. Thank You!
4,It reached up to about 40 feet away with a phone. After about 3 hours or so it got a little flaky but I like it.
5,Hooked easily. Use in receive mode. It DOES charge and run at same time. Did not really test for lag time. But seems to be almost none that I could tell. Feeding audio to a P.A. system from a source. House speakers and outside P.A. seemed in sync. Ran it for 3 days about 8 hours a day.
5,I matched this TROND V5.0 with a set of wireless headphones for using on my metal detector.It also pairs with a set of wireless earbuds.I find there is no latency in this set-up.Sharp and clear tones.
5,Using this in receiver mode so I can use my wired headphones without needing to connect them to my phone. I'm surprised that they actually sound even better than when plugged directly to the phone itself.
5,I love this thing. I bought to install in my CanAm Spyder. Once paired and turned on it connects to my iPhone immediately and plays through the bikes sound system. The sound is GREAT and there is no delay. I would recommend this product in a heart beat.
5,The little bluetooth it's useful if you headphone didn't have a bluetooth connect. Work great with the headphone. The manual is detailed to show how to start it. Work pertty good on a non bluetooth device.
5,Easy hook up
5,My wife bought this for me for a birthday present so I could stream my music stored on my iPod classic. This works like a charm and no issues with pairing. On my first use it was on for at least 12 hours no problem with the battery.
5,Good product. WS able to make an old fm radio a little easier to use in a cu e environment.
5,Thank You
2,I could not get it to work with my laptop. So it was returned.
5,This does everything it is suppose to do.  Great little gadget
5,This was exactly what my husband and I have been looking for. The pairing went very smoothly and now we both can listen to the TV while the kids are sleeping (small house) without having to keep the volume down too low. Overall a good product and we are very pleased with it.
5,Amazing sound i would like it to have a little longer range. It is only good for aout 30 feet. great sound quality wheen connected to my cheap headphones or my bluthooth Anker speaker.
5,This Bluetooth "Transmitter" was WAY cheaper than buying a new Bluetooth mp3 player. I love how it works. Following the instructions to "pair" it with my old mp3 player was easy. Now I'm happily using my old mp3 player...cordless! Kudos for a good product!
3,The TROND worked as advertised but did not work for my application.  I attached it to my TV to use with the Amazon Echo.  It linked  easily but the latency was too much and created an (no pun intended) echo situation.
5,I am using it with my new LG tv  for using my Bluetooth headphones..After I bought it I realized that my tv did not have a 3.5 mm jack.. bought another digital to analogue audio converter to use this. It’s working fine now.
3,Tried to pair two Sony Bluetooth headsets with a tv after a while one of the headsets would randomly disconnect.  Tried many times but always a problem with connect the two headsets.  Returning but hope the product works for others.
5,I already owned a Bluetooth wireless headphone jack called Jumbl and this pairs with it perfectly so I can listen to my TV wirelessly. Great tech support too.
5,Haven't had it long but it worked great! Hooked right up to the treadmill at Planet Fitness and paired easily with my FitBit Flyer headphones. Not sure listening to the evening news is a good idea during my workout but yay!
2,TROND only gives 30-day window to keep or return this product. By the time my IT appointment was scheduled IT guy showed me how to use it and the two times he had to come back because I never could get it to reliably connect to my SONY bluetooth headphones what a joke. I'm sure there are easier bluetooth methods out there. Go find one. Also this is my first Amazon Prime purchase that cannot be returned. Not sure what to think about that.
5,Got this to update an old plasma TV and a new iPad to use with Bluetooth headphones. Wanted to be able to connect 2 pairs at once. It did the trick was easy to set up just follow the instructions works great.
3,Sound quality is decent and the low latency is cool but there's a LOT of background static. Anytime a quiet part comes up you can hear the static turn on and off.
1,Well I have ordered two of these. The first one would not hold a charge and had to be replaced. The replacement worked excellently the first time I used it but I could not get it to turn back on again. I guess I am stuck listening to my iPod Nano with wired earbuds. :-(
5,It took a little work to get it running but the troubleshooting on the Internet helped. The sound quality is pretty good
5,Works perfectly send an audiobook signal from Sandisc MP3 player to my Honda Prelude car stereo. Well packaged with many accessories. Does the job! Recommended. I can't comment on battery life as I have only had it a few days.
3,So far it's perfect for turning my old stereo into playing to a Bluetooth speaker however when using it with my TV which is what I really bought it for there is a latency delay that makes it useless as the words don't match up to the lip movements.
5,I got this to use on airplane seat back entertainment and Bluetooth earbuds. I have only used it once so far and it worked great.
5,The product works great and the instructions are written in real English with proper sentences and real verbs! Very happy with the product. Arrived a day late but I live in a dinky rural place so no big deal. Using it in my RV so I can listen to the Sirius radio outside with wireless speakers.
4,Does what it is designed to do. I use it in TX mode to pair my stereo with BT headset.
4,Set up is a little confusing but once it's understood this thing works very well.
5,This thing worked like a charm I was able to connect my Apple AirPods to the treadmill at my gym because they don’t have Bluetooth connection to the tv’s Very easy and sounded great also.
5,Works well. No perceivable audio lag. Small form factor but could have a longer headphone cord so that I could hide it better.  If you install on backplane of computer then the shorter cord is probably desired (less stuff to manage). Cord is about 4" long (as shown in picture).  USB-miniUSB cord is about 18".
5,Batter life is good and no gaps in sound. Easy connectivity and not hard to use. No extra software or anything
5,Wanted to make my active JBL speakers bluetooth-capable. Worked great. Highly suggest this product for any wired connections you’d like to set up as such. Easy process and the users guide is helpful.
3,I am not too impressed using this with my iPHONE and car AUX. I have to remove the device from my cache every time I get in the car and reset the connection.
5,It works great for me!  I have it connected to the audio output of my Tivo Bolt and it pairs nicely with my SoundBot SB220 Bluetooth headphones.  There is a tiny bit of latency between the TV output and the headphones but not enough to be bothersome.  Definitely would purchase again.
5,The product delivered was exactly as described and the shipping time was excellent.  When I had a question not covered by the owner's guide my email was answered in just a few hours with clear and accurate instructions on ho to achieve the connections I needed.  Great product good price and excellent customer service.
5,I'm using this to pump audio from my home stereo out to the bluetooth speakers on my deck - works great could not be happier with the range and sound quality.
5,Works great connected with no issues.
5,Works great in my car. The device easily paired with my iPhone also it works withou inter fearing eight the Bluetooth GPS and allows simultaneous voice calling and audio playback. Worth the money.
2,When paired with my Soundcore Space NC by Anker earphones I was only hearing sound in the left earpiece. Tried with SoundPEATS Bluetooth Headphones and had same problem. Got a replacement unit and had same result. Tech support unable to resolve. Bought a Giveet Bluetooth V5.0 Transmitter and Receiver and everything works beautifully.Apparently Amazon does not refund the purchase price for these returned items that they received on 10/8
5,I have not had any problems with the Trond. I use it to transmit from the TV audio output plug. All sounds are present and transmits through walls. Battery charges itself automatically and it doesn't seem to overcharge. If I know it won't be necessary for days I just turn it off.
5,easy
2,Granted may not be technically savee but I don't think you have to be to recognize a significant delay between the sound and the mouth movement while watching a movie. I did read the reviews as well as the information about the transmitter but made it sound like the delay was slight barely noticeable...........if that's their idea of slight...........then I can't imagine what their idea of significant is. I would have sent it back but a series of things happened and then before I knew it is was too late. So now I'm stuck with this thing.
5,I use it with my Nintendo switch and my old iPods when I go fishing. Very happy with the sound quality.
5,My wife and I used this device in Europe to both listen to Rick Steve's audio tours of Germany and Italy at the same time.  It worked very well when paired with bluetooth earpieces and was much cheaper than doing a live tour.  Great product!
5,Very impressed 👏 not only you can Bluetooth one speaker but 3 loving it
5,This product is worth ever penny
5,"I wanted this to hook up some MPow Thor Bluetooth headphones to my TV as I have an older streaming device. Works great plugged into my older Toshiba LCD and I've never had an issue connecting the headphones. Awesome. "
5,It works as advertised in both the transmit and receive mode. I use it to connect with my phone (for Pandora) with a dual input headset in which the other input is a USB audio from the PC. Now I can here both.
5,It works well with my bluetooth headphones and airpods pro also.Pairing is easy. This transmitter/receiver is very useful. I recommend.
5,If you ever wanted to use a Bluetooth speaker with your switch this is fantastic! It works with my UE Boom speaker without a hitch. The connection is strong and does not cut out during gameplay.
5,At first we could not get the transmitter to pair with two bluetooth speakers but then we tried a couple more times and it worked great. This allowed us to have the sound fill the room from two sources instead of just one. I would buy this again.
5,Worked great! Cheaper one I bought first didn't sound near as good! Easy to connect and set up!
5,Works great! Packaged nice as well.
4,I could not get it to work with what I wanted originally but after I purchased new headphones everything is good.
5,I turned it on and connected to my speakers right away simple easy fast. I really love this transmitter. Do not spend more to get a different transmitter this is the one!
5,Awesome addition to the switch—  now i can use my Bluetooth headphones on the goI added a JDS labs  3.5mm cable for a clean look!! 👍🏽🤓
4,I had issues with customer service returning e-mails. But once I figured it out it worked fine.
5,Works as advertised but wish the battery would last longer but what do you expect given its small size. Fairly easy to set up and then works great. We use it to watch TV  so as not to bother other people
5,The accompanying directions were a little difficult to figure out but once done it works like a charm.  Great price packing and right on time.  Not hard to pair up.  Company also is really great about communication.  Recommend this product
5,Have used this with a few different non-Bluetooth devices and it works very well.  Mates instantly with speakers and BT headphones.  Seems to stay charged for a long time.  Very happy with this product.
5,This little device works great as a transmitter and a receiver !  To the not so technically inclined people : Use the OUT ports if you use it as transmitter ( audio OUT or headphone port) and the IN ports if you use it as receiver (audio IN or microphone port).
3,After multiple attempts to pair this device with my PowerBeats2 including an hour-long call with AppleCare I returned this product to Amazon. Instructions that came with the device were sparse as well.
2,I used it to connect my sound bar to my TV.
1,The product was easy to set up and use in every way. However sound quality is terrible. Interference and cutting out constantly despite my being very close to the transmitter within 10 feet.I bought this specifically so I could hear dialog better. It actually made things worse. Don't waste your money.
4,Works great bought it for my buddies birthday. He is pleased with it so far. Says the battery life is good.
5,When I opened the box I was surprised by how small the transmitter is which is not very obvious from the image.  The paring with my BT headset is very easy and it works great.  I am really happy with the device.
5,Trond sent me an email ahead of delivery to be sure that I have no problems with the device. Nice packaging with various cables. I have not used it as a transmitter; only as a receiver . Smaller than I expected. Paired easily with my IPhone7+ Sound quality is good.
5,This BT Trans/Recv works perfectly with our home tv/stereo system and BT headsets. We leave it attached via an RCA jack connection and plugged in to stay charged. We can easily pair it with 2 headsets at the same time when ever we want to listen to stereo output
5,Got this for my metal detector along with the Mpow H1 Bluetooth Headphones. Work great and doesn't cost hundreds of dollars. No lag and pairs instantly. Great buy.
3,This was very easy to hook  up to our TV using the RCA connections but we could not controller the volume.  Make sure your headphones or device has its own volume controller.  It sounded great even though it was very loud.
5,I'm using this so two people with bluetooth headphones can listen to the same thing from my phone while we go on walks. The unit is really tiny and easy to carry and I didn't have any problem pairing to two headsets. I'm very happy with it.
3,Couldn't get it to connect to bluetooth
5,After reviewing the instructions I found it very easy to use. I use it with my TV and my iPod. If you’re looking for a Bluetooth device buy this one.
5,This thing is awesome.. I use it to link my pico projector to my 25watt desktop woofer and jawbone speaker. I have successfully transformed my desktop into a mini personal theater thanks to this baby. I love that it can charge while remaining in use. My coworkers are so jealous!!!
2,This should be fine if you are using for sound only. Has a slight delay so using it to watch movies is out of sync with the picture.
5,Connects my wireless headphones to my non-Bluetooth TV. Only issue so far is charging. I guess the USB charging from the TV would require the TV to be turned on for longer periods. Not an issue as I have a power outlet directly behind the TV so just plugged it in direct.
5,Works great with my Switch. Fanally can play games without wires. Set up was easy and it pairs very quickly from power on.
5,Can confirm that this supports APTX-LL.  Used them with Soundpeats Q12 Plus earphones and there was no lag when playing a digital piano/keyboard.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KLWS43V/
5,makes a very annoying noise when close to death.often have to jump through hoops to connect but hey its bluetooth.
5,Other than having to turn off all my other Bluetooth devices to use it it works great! I use it with my TV and my wireless headphones. Worth the buy now I can game quietly.
5,The Trond Bluetooth works perfectly. I connect it as a transmitter to my Pioneer home theater headphone jack and while paired to my Sennheiser Momemtum 2 wireless headphones and I enjoy my tv or stereo without disturbing anyone. The Trond works as advertised. Great customer service is also very appreciated.
5,Much better than expected. Easy to use. Sound quality and distance of the Bluetooth works well. Quality and value. Great purchase
3,Random drops in connection.  Poor sound quality. Wouldn’t recommend
5,No issues easy to connect.
5,I've purchased two to date. One for my old 52" Toshiba LCD to run Sony MDR 1000x through freaking awesome. The other is for the MP3 I use for the trike bikes boat and jet ski with thePhaiser BHS-530 Bluetooth Headphones . I'm a happy happy thanks guys!!!
5,It does what it supposed to and it's a beautiful thing! I only use it to pair a pair of Bluetooth headphones to an old iPod shuffle for workouts but you can use it as a transmitter or receiver at the flick of a switch.Worth every penny.
5,I like it the installation was easy just follow the instructions my it's connected thru the RCA connectors of my Sony KDL40 TV and pair with an iLive headphones the sound is really good and was setup in 10 minutes.
5,Works great on my oldish Bose allowing me to send radio or CD music out to a Bluetooth speaker on my porch and patio.  I have also used it as a receiver for the Bose to play music from my phone.
5,Paired my ipod classic perfectly to my Samsung Galaxy Buds+ on the first try.
5,This thing is awesome. I was looking for an inexpensive way to transmit sound from my tv to blue tooth speakers. I bought this and TaoTronics Wireless Earphones. Set up was a breeze and now I can listen to the TV as loud as I want without bother the family!
5,Hey it just plain works.  I liked it so much I brought another.  I originally was looking for a small bluetooth radio. But nada.  So I brought the Trond to convert a small radio to wireless!  Bingo!
5,This is exactly what I was looking for and works beautifully. I purchased a Meyoung projector and needed a way to connect my bose speakers to it. This did the trick. Very happy with this purchase.
4,Useful Bluetooth transmitter provides good connection to wireless headphones
5,Please if you buy this product & you can't get it to work call or go on line to get help from the Trond techs. I did & they helped! It works well now!!!
5,Works great as a transmitter or receiver. I tried it out both ways. My headphones were not Bluetooth 5.0 but still worked great.
3,I used on the t.v.  and there is small delay the words do not match the picture
5,Steam from my phone to stereo reciever.  I love it. Range is fair for signal 200 ft
5,Item wasn't made to do what I thought it would. My bad. Manufacturer contacted me and resolved the problem completely and with no hassle. I would definitely deal with them in the future.
5,Great little blue tooth transmitter.  Decent distance  easy to use.  Bought 2 because they worked so well
5,This bluetooth transmitter works perfectly with either a computer or tv.  Recommend highly!
5,I love this Trond transceiver. 👍It turns my mp3 player into a bluetooth device.Works seamlessly with the Airmod bluetooth receiver.No more headphone wires hooking on desks or doors.Best of all NO LOSS OF AUDIO QUALITY.  5 💥
5,I used this device to connect to trond headphones without any issues the transmitter is connected to the headphone jack on my metal detector no lag is noticed.
5,It worked immediately without any hassle. I now have two of them separated by about 50 feet though and I must turn one off before I can pair with the other one. I'm completely satisfied with them.
5,Works great as a transmitter and a receiver.  Once I read the directions a second time it was easy to use and very reliable.  It has a good battery life but fits nicely with my desktop so I often have it plugged in.
5,Small size easy to plug into my tv. Pairs quickly to my headphones. Resets if needed as stated in the instructions. I leave it powered up and so far no issues at all. Great product and seller.
5,Had no problem with installation and set-up. The transmitter is connected to the audio out mini stereo jack of my tv and paired with a JBL Charge bluetooth speaker. Latency is not an issue and I am very happy with the Trond transmitter.  Thanks
5,I use it to link my blue tooth enabled hearing aids to my home entertainment center. And as an aux input for the audio system in my car. Great sound in both cases!
4,works great but it is a shame that you cannot advance songs or answer calls with it.
4,It works just as advertised!
5,Bastante fácil el emparejamiento tanto en la función de receptor y transmisor.
5,This is a great way to go wireless in a car that hasn't.  I just plug it in and push it out of the way.
5,Works well!  Low-latency as advertised.  We use this in a live stage performance to stream sound effects from an iPhone.  Timing works well enough for electronic rim shots in response to my dumb jokes!
5,12 hour battery pairs and connects with ease and the price is hard to beat.
5,Very simply to setup and great quality I use to privately view my home theater awesome. Had questions of others usage customer service is great.
5,Took out of the box plugged it in connected easily to my Pixel 2XL(which is no easy feat) plugged in my headphones and everything was good to go. Used it for a few hours today with no issues
5,Great product it connected to my phone quick. battery life is still unknown but so far I have used it about 4 hours and it was still going. Product was shipped quick and I received it as promised. The packaging was great not just bubble wrap and a bag.
5,I had an issue with the unit past the 30 day period.  The seller worked to resolved the issue.
5,Love this yes you can pair two headphones to it I have. Pair each device turn them both on. This makes anything bluetooth. Very handy going cordless on the treadmill at the Gym I go to that broadcasts to their machines.
2,Unfortunately i have to revoke my previous 5 star review because the built in battery started suffering and then went permanently dead with no possibility to charge or replace it and after not very many charge cycles so i think they may be using someone's QC rejects to keep the price down. But with a battery that passed QC it would be pretty solid.
1,This is the second Tron V5.0 Transmitter I've purchased and like the first one it worked very well until just past the warranty expiration date and then it stopped working.  A real disappointment for a supposedly 4/5 star product.  Beware.
5,Using as a transmitter from my AV receiver to bluetooth headphones  Works well and pairs very easily.
5,Good product transmits well with no noise feedback when used with a quality cigarette lighter adapter. I also gave these as a gift to my two children so I have bought these a total of 3 times.
5,I used this to make my TV bluetooth friendly so I could use my bluetooth headphones with it.  It works great have not have one problem.  Great product!
5,Good design and packaging
5,Great sound decent noise reduction for passive noise canceling and great battery life. Bluetooth connectivity is simple and good range.
5,This transmitter/receiver is very easy to use and works well. I've used it both as a receiver and as a transmitter. Zero problems with either function. I have been able to pair it with many different devices (e.g. iPhone bose bluetooth speaker projector and bose headphones).
5,I usually go with Taotronics. This one is just as good. Cheers!
5,Easy to use and pair. Battery lasts for a while. I chose this one because it's a 2 in 1. Now my girlfriend can sleep with me not having the tv volume up and on my headphones instead...which makes for better surround sound BTW!
5,I use this gizmo in conjunction with my wireless headphones so that I can watch the TV (a Roku TV) with the sound turned up a bit loud and not disturb anyone else in the house. The customer service at TROND is exemplary.
5,Simple to use great sound from receiving end great range.
5,Worked great in connecting my CD player to the Bluetooth in my car. I have a lot of books on CD and the newer cars don't have CD players anymore so this is a way for me to play the hundreds of CDs I still own.
5,My only complaint is the battery life but for this sound quality and price I feel like I don't have the right to complain.
5,Works perfect!!  I pair this with the QC35 headphones from Bose for gaming Netflix and TV.  The delay is so small that I can not even see it.  Kinda cool to be able to turn any TV or desktop computer into a Bluetooth device.
1,Can not tell if anything is connected to the device. I think my Bluetooth headset connected but no sound. will pay more for a device that tells me what is connected to it then if no sound you know the input device is the problem.
5,Nothing to dislike!  I plugged my TROND into my home stereo system and paired it with my Bluetooth speakers in another room and it worked immediately.  I'm very satisfied.
5,Easy to set up and use.
5,Great battery life and easy to pair. Much better quality than another one I purchased.
5,This is really great. Once you make sure that it is within range you can transform your wired system into wireless effortlessly and reliably. I rarely give 5 stars unreservedly but this products really deserves them.
2,I guess a bit of sharpness gets lost in the transmission.  My real beef though is that ALTHOUGH IT IS LISTED AS A PRIME PRODUCT RETURNS ARE NOT FREE.  Only by traveling to an Amazon hub (not even a UPS store!) can you get free return.  So look out.
1,Bought the Trond 2 in 1 and it just didn't connect to my bluetooth device.  It never 'saw' my device.  Followed all the instructions and the limited troubleshooting advice.  Reached out to the company who act very responsive but who actually only quote the instructions and then say 'don't worry it's guaranteed so just return it if it doesn't work'.  Not really happy with a device that doesn't work out of the box and then I have to spend time and money to return it.  I would rather a company sell something that 'just works'.  I'm just eating the cost of the Trond and trying another company.
4,Gets the job done easily for devices that do not have bluetooth support.
5,I was still listening to an iPod classic but hated I couldn't use my bluetooth headphones with it. The TROND solved my problem. It was so easy to set up and use.
5,Great device I was worried I could not use my old I pod nano but after I connected the device it worked flawlessly.
5,Great transmitter for use with laptop and television sets. 1.2.3. Easy setup.
5,easy to connect and it stays connected
5,Purchased this to stream audio in my older Mercedes E350.  Very pleased -- extremely easy to use and good audio quality.  Have not tested battery life yet but promised 8 hours is impressive if true.
5,Connected incredibly easy! I have a set of headphones and a Bose receiver both connected to them with no latency.
4,Works well. No need to re-initialize the speaker every time the TV is turned on.
4,Works as advertised
5,Small size is a major plus ease of connection is another works with headphones very well.
3,I would love to know if others experience this or not.  I do not know if it is Bluetooth related or not ...  The sound seems to actually fade in and out with Sony speakers.
2,The sound quality was not the very best.
1,I this so my wife and I could both listen through our head sets it will NOT connect to both.  I followed the instructions exactly but it will only connect with the last headset paired.  It will not connect to both.
1,Product not as stated.  Supposed to be female connection to TV AV within the intermediary but received as male connection instead.  tried to connect bypassing male to male as stated within instructions. Apparently there has to be an intermidiary to make it work.
5,Love this item.  Allows me to listen to my IPod with Bluetooth headphones.
5,Eady to connect
1,No app with this so you can’t select what you want it to connect to. I was trying to connect to my BT rock speakers for an outdoor projector. What a let down
4,Item shipped on time.  Easy setup works as advertised. A good product that I would buy again.
5,Easy set up and good range this is my second purchase.  First unit went into the wash.  It didn’t survive. Great feature send or receive.  Incredible value
5,Very easy to hook up and it works like a charm.
5,I have an older car without blu-tooth connectivity so I cannot stream music from my iPhone to my car's speakers.  But with this simple device I now have blu-tooth audio as if it came built into my car.  This product works great.
5,good
5,Simple to install just plug and play. Connected very easily to my Android phone. I like that it's both a transmitter and a receiver. I connected it to my old stereo equipment so I can play music from my cell phone.
5,Just for my needs
5,Did the job I wanted! Now my vinyl player is wireless. Setup was easy and Sounds great.
3,Look good but it's interrupting
5,Very pleased Would recommend them to anybody who wants to have two headphones two a TV set.
5,Worked perfect right from the start. It is easy to pair and the connection distance is satisfactory. I have had it for about a month so we will see how it lasts.
4,Sometimes it takes a while to connect (5 to 7 tries) even after a full charge.
5,I needed a solution to receive Bluetooth and drive a powered speaker via aux.  This worked perfectly.  Use it nearly every day.
5,Great item to have!! I use with TV...iPad...phone to reciever whatever was not bluetooth now is!
5,Easy set up great audio quality with my Sony Bluetooth headphones. I use this with my work laptop.
5,This works like a charm it was a breeze to set up. Great small dervice
5,I needed a bluetooth transmitter for silent tv listening. I ended up on this cuz i wanted a transmitter with little to no lag. I paired this with my bluetooth headphones and there is very little lag so im a happy customer.
4,Some lag on sound sync but works well. Easy time to set up.
5,Always pairs with my Cowin E7 headphones without difficulty.  Use primarily to connect headphones to my ONKYO audio and SAMSUNG GALAXY S7.
2,This is the 3rd model of this same type device that I have tried and it also has its issues.  This would paired quickly with my headset but would not work while charging.  The instructions say to plug the unit in to USB power before powering the unit on (which I did) but the unit turns itself off as soon as I turn on the audio source (connected device).  Even on battery power the sound is scratchy and poor.  Returning it to Amazon.
5,my car has bluetooth just for calls. this just fixed it - I put it in the middle compartment with a USB + AUX (power and audio). turn it on when I start driving and can listen to music and etc.
5,This is a GREAT gizmo. I bought one then another then a third for my the gear that has no/poor bluetooth.
3,Procuct works as advertisied but does not work for bluethoth phone applications.Would not pair with my Samsung note 4 to allow telephone only music.I only want it for telephone and mistakenly bought this.
5,Works well. I have used it primarily as a transmitter. It has easily connected to different Bluetooth devices. The range has been comparable to other devices that transmit (iPhone iPad etc.) Very pleased...would buy from again!
5,Had some issues to connect but a very helpful Trond support helped out so a pair of in-ears now can be used with Nintendo Switch to become 100% mobile.
5,I have been getting electronic products that don't quite work right for the last few years. This product has been a pleasant surprise. It paired with a Bluetooth speaker and connects with it every time it turns on. very nice.
5,Everything works great. The only negative comment I would make is the battery could last longer.
2,The APTX-LL (low latency) codec available only for 'TX' (transmission) mode not for 'RX' (reception) mode.It's really obvious that there is a ~4 sec lag in reception mode... and thus this is unusable for the reason purchased.Why doesn't the manufacturer or Amazon list this specification found only after purchase in the 'welcome manual' and after a 'delay' for delivery?Now to try to find the fine print on this spec for other BT receivers and wait again for one to be delivered.
4,Very easy to install and connect. Price is fine
4,This works amazing !!!
5,It has worked great in the gym linking up with treadmills and ellipticals that don't have bluetooth.
5,as expected...  wish it had more features like volume etc.. but heck it works and it is cheap.. needs more instructions  but got it to work
5,I am having good luck with this product.  Simple to use good sound quality and I was able to get rid of the aux cord to my phone!  Nice buy for the price!
5,Charges fast but is small
4,Work fine.
4,ideal for viewing TV
5,Works great- both as a receiver and a transmitter. I use it with bluetooth speakers by plugging it into the output on a projector. It was the missing link to getting rid of all the wires around the house.
5,Works well so far! I bought it to transmit music from my record player on one side of the room to my sound bar on the other about 15 feet away. Very easy to set up and use. Would recommend.
5,I used this as a bluetooth output on a CD player. Good range and sound quality even at the other end of the house
2,Connection was troublesome. Bought this to connect an electric piano to my soundbar. There is almost a two second delay in sound from the keyboard to the soundbar. Not what I expected.
5,Pros works as out says it does priced rite. Cons oil get back to you if I find any. Great product over the top support. Very happy with puchase.
5,I haven't used this product extensively however I opened it set it up to use on my iPod Classic and play music to a Braven Pro bluetooth speaker.  It is compact easy to use and it sounded music sounded great.
5,Better instructions on installation and connecting devices.
5,Works as advertised
5,Pretty good item fast shipment to. Item paired effortlessly with my wireless headphones and didn't lose connection throughout my morning run. Worth the price I will say extends the possibilities of my Ipod inclusive of wireless speakers.
2,My use case is as a car Bluetooth sound upgrade - my car only uses BT 2. Sound is good but it just doesn't work as a car BT adapter because it doesn't automatically turn on when it gets power from the car turning on. As a result I have to open my arm rest and dig down to physically turn on the this adapter each time I get into my car.
2,The transmitter linked with 2 different headphones rather easily. I got this to use with the TV and my digital piano. The audio delay makes it unusable for both. For listening to music they work great. According to mfg I should get their headphones. Do I want to invest another $70 for a product that may or may not fix the problem?
5,I had no problems with it. Charged it connected via Bluetooth and it's worked ever since.
5,Plugged it into my old style component stereo and quickly paired with my Bluetooth headphones. Just what I needed.
1,Battery life is a joke. Overpriced. Live and learn. Does what it is supposed to though and TX mode is useful.UpdateThey reached out to me and sent me an upgraded unit. They were extremely persistent and I am grateful for their commitment to customer satisfaction. I will remember and recommend their products based on their support.
5,I bought this to be used with a metal detector and the small size made it excellent for my needs.
3,Wouldn’t work with my older Samsung flat screen but works with my woofer and Nintendo switch
1,Upon putting your bluetooth earpiece in paring mode your device will want to make sure that you are actually trying to pair with the Transmitter by getting a confirming signal from it. Since the Transmitter doesn't have any UI for selecting your device and sending confirmation signal to it these two junks have to awkwardly make wild guesses and connect/pair after wasting 10min of your life. Even after pairing these device/transmitter will do that same dance every time you try to turn them back on and reconnect.Waste of your time. If you want wireless audio get a headset with a dedicated transmitter.
1,But this to use as a receiver for my car. We have for my phone connected right away and the sound quality was great  However after one day the red light started flashing and the unit shut off. I tried recharging using the cable provided as well as other cables I have laying around and multiple different chargers. Nothing would work and the unit is pretty much trash.  I tried asking on here if maybe I was missing something but got no response.
5,Purchased 2 to transmit from 1 room with an amplifier and turntable to our family room to receive to our home theater system. Working perfectly over a distance of about 16 feet and through 2 walls.  Very pleased thank you!
5,Great item. Recommended.
4,It works as stated by headset linked perfectly good price and quality.
5,Great product!  Easy connect compared to my previous bluetooth transmitter and has minimal delay with television.  I am using with a v4.1 headset.  I have used for a couple of weeks daily with no problems strictly for use with tv.
5,I use mine to transmit to bluetooth earbuds from my MP3 player.  Can't say enough good things about it.
5,Wonderful service from a little device. I hooked it to my old stereo and by using my bluetooth headset i can listen to TV whilst on the treadmill or in bed.  Expectations exceeded and price was great.
1,Don't Buy!!! If you do buy them I encourage that you do a quick A/B test listening to your headphones plugged directly into your phone and then the same audio from your phone via blue tooth to the Trond receiver and then to your headphones. You will immediately hear how much of the highs are muted and distorted amongst an overall sound degradation. I bought 2 of these units at once and both have the same problem so it's not just a single bad unit.I've had other similar Bluetooth transmitter that work fine but these have noticeably bad audio quality.
5,This is my second one; one for my car and one for my patio TV.  Works very nicely.
3,Sound was delayCan not use for karaoke.
5,Works perfectly. I use the transmitter to connect my iPod Classic to a Bluetooth speaker. Never a problem connecting. The sound is good. Lost the directions. eTrond responded within twelve hours with a pdf of the instructions. Very pleased with my purchase.
1,I tried purchasing 2 different sets of wireless bluetooth headsets and neither were compatible with this product. total disappointment and waste of money and effort.
5,I like that I can connect more than one headset at one time.
1,This device was supposed to allow two Bluetooth headphones to pair simultaneously. Never happened. I spent several hours trying to make this happen to no avail. All I got was a headache. The tech support is awful. Whoever “Bruce” is he keeps repeating the same exact instructions as in the manual (duh!). And as for Amazon technical support forget it: Some large room with lots of loud voices and the person I talked to couldn’t figure out which button to push to actually hear me and eventually just hung up on me. Horrible experience. I sent it back and will try another device.
5,Easy setup & user friendly
2,The device was easy enough to connect and the bluetooth did work and it connected to my iPhone just fine but the sound was not much better than mono.  I don't know if it was actually stereo mostly midrange response. If you want something for talk radio go for it but that's all it's good for.
5,Works fine when connected. A little slow to connect battery life less than expected. Otherwise good buy.
5,Works well with two of my ear buds.  Use this tut o watch TV while on the treadmill.  Works perfectly...
5,Great unit work great with my shortwave radio I can go all over the house and still here it in my bluetooth headset
2,I've used this on a few different devices and it's all been the same so far: It connects but I have to crank the sound to max to barely be able to hear. I really want to like this product but I'll probably just return it. Not worth the $$.
5,Unit worked will it is always plugged in so I don’t know about battery life.
5,I have no problem at all it's easy to connect or pair to any bluetooth devices. The price is not bad either.
5,Perfect for making my Bluetooth headphones work for my tv. I love it.
5,This is a great product.  It works well.  I plugged it in and connected my blue-tooth headphones to it and all was well.
5,Short battery life only draw back. Bl only lasts about 4 hours.
5,Works as described with my tair sport wireless headset. I wanted a pdf version of user manual and trond responded right away with via email.  Good customer service!
5,Smaller footprint than expected and that's just fine. Great functionality so far. It has been a snap to pair with devices and I have not experienced any latency issues.
5,Thank you very much! I already connected your device to the TV. Works very well 5 stars to the device and 10 stars to you for caring about us buyers.
4,Battery life could be better
5,Does what it’s supposed to do with no issues. Comes with extra wires which was also really nice:)
5,This product performance/set-up was a pleasant surprise. It work just as advertised; now my 1966 Kenwood Receiver and Sansui speakers are Blue Tooth connected to my iPhone 7 Plus!! I'm delighted with the price and performance.Thanks!
5,Low latency was the reason I bought this. It is much better but still noticeable.
5,Transmitter was easy to set up and so far has worked seamlessly
5,A little hard the first time but after the first time real easy and simple
5,Great product. My TV did not support Bluetooth connection. I could not use a Bluetooth headset to hear sound. With this product I am able to wear a Bluetooth headset and dance along with Zumba.
5,Very pleased to use this product to give Bluetooth capability to my vintage stereo. Easy to install; comes with attachments for various devices.
5,I love how easy it was to connect my non Bluetooth TV to my Beats Noise Canceling Bluetooth headset.  I can now watch tv at night without disturbing others.  Sound is crystal clear no static and NO DELAY!
5,Having trouble with the battery; but seller responded great and helping me work through the issues; love the hands free; trying to get it to wireless. Again - seller is following up and responding excellently.
5,easy to use works every time. awesome product
5,Low latency. Simple set-up!
5,Works as advertised. Range is decent for a unit so small. I don't have any issues with it.
5,Very happy with this. Needed a dual mode (transmitter & receiver) for my devices and does the job.
5,Set up was simple smooth and connection to my AirPods and Bose blue tooth headphones were seamless. Sound transmission was clean clear and continuous.
5,My wife and I travel a lot and like to watch movies on the plane. After I paired these with Bluetooth earphones we were able to share a movie without hasseling with splitter and wired earphones. Great product.
5,It was as advertised
1,Got this little piece of junk to transmit the audio from my LG video projector to my Big Jambox and it worked relatively well for just over a month with oscillating degrees of lag - most times it was almost unnoticeable on occasion it would be irritating - until one day it just... didn't. As much as I've tried ever since it simply will not connect to save its life. I've never had any problem connecting my speaker to any other Bluetooth device but this thing will just blink until it gets tired and then shut off automatically. Would not recommend to anyone hopefully Amazon and/or Trond will have the good sense to reach out and take responsibility for this awful piece of equipment.
2,This stopped working for me after just a few uses. The device charges but the it no longer pairs with my airpods.
1,need to return for another product
5,Works well I would buy it again....but I had to get a different model. This one doesn't have an optical port. Worked very well for what its supposed to do though.
5,So far all is good bought this little device to connect to a few different components. seems to work well for everything I have.
5,So far so good. Is very light and easy to use. But have to wait and see for longevity and battery holds real well.
5,I bought this for my Nintendo Switch and it sounds amazing and little to zero latency. Very easy to pair with any Bluetooth headphones.
3,Have had no success trying to sync two sets of Bluetooth headphones at once. It will pair with only one set or the other.
5,Very nice little device.  Love that it does both transmit and receive.  Had no trouble at all connecting to BT devices. Was looking for v4.1 and this does it all.
4,I like it!
5,Took me 20 seconds to set it & pair with a Bose Soundlink Color. No lag. Just got it so I have no clue on the battery life yet. But so far so good....
5,Works great. Now we can stream music through our old stereo.
5,Smaller than expected which is a good thing. I use it to plug into my aux jack to stream bt music to my car because the bt in my cadillac ats only works for the phone. It works great.
5,I am very pleased with this product. I reached out to Customer Service with a question on the product's use and received a reply back in less than 24 hours.  I recommend this product!
5,Wow this product works like a champ. Will have to order another one for my sister's
4,1/4 second delay noticed through sound bar.
5,Me agrada por que me es más útil utilizar el celular de manera inalámbrica
2,Was great while it worked. Now the power light is red and it doesn't matter how many times you push it it won't turn on. Only used it a few times a month for about 9 months.
5,Powerful results in a little package. Very very impressed with this product and excellent sound quality
5,Worked great for awhile then it stopped sending the left ear sound. Contacted support troubleshooted it and then they sent me a new one. Works great now and support was great!
5,TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter Receiver / Wireless 3.5mm Audio Adapter ... It's all that and more. It really works!!!It's all that the maker says it does. BUY IT & ENJOY. 5 STARS!!!!!
5,Using two in my home and love them. Had a need to contact customer service and they were superb. Highly recommended.
5,Pairing could be a little tricky at first but it works great once I finally got it paired. I connect it to Nintendo switch and pair with my Bluetooth earbuds.
5,Works great
3,Lasted 6 months apparently couldn't handle car heat.
5,That I can hook into a sound system and transmit Bluetooth to my headphones. The battery life only last for only four hours.
5,Mounted behind TV and on 24/7.  Only used when wife likes to listen to Walking Dead et al at loud volume and gets more submerged w. the action wearing a head set.
5,Work great with everything even made a wired head phone wireless
5,I have this for my upstairs tv and works great.
1,The reason I bought this was to watch TV at night using my Airpods. As much as a tried I couldn't get this to work. I bought this one instead which works perfectly with Airpods: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GR1XCST/
1,This transmitter was unable to maintain connectivity with a pair of headphones that were less than 10 ft away for more than a few minutes. There were no walls or other obstructions between the transmitter and the headphones. The headphones were able to connect and maintain a connection with another transmitter in the same location without difficulty. The sound quality when the TROND was connected was great but if a connection can't be maintained that's rather moot.
5,Easy to set up worked perfectly included all needed connectors.
1,I tried this with a TV in a  brand new travel trailer connecting it to a very state of the art sound system.  It took some work to get things to pair which was likely operator error/learning curve but once connected there was a nearly 1 second delay from the TV sound to the stereo.  I tried everything and never could resolve the issue.  Tried it with Bluetooth earphones and had the same result.
5,Arrived on time and was exactly what I was looking for to convert my old Sony headphones to wireless. All of the Bluetooth headphones I had tried at retail stores were either poor sound quality or too expensive.
5,We're using this device to listen to the TV with Bluetooth earbuds.  Makes it much easier for us to hear and we don't have to share the noise of having the TV volume turned up with the neighbors!
5,best sound quality. Signal strong  to reach to other rooms in my house. Thanks!
5,Good: It was easy to setup and the range is good enough for my smaller home. Instructions were easy to follow.
1,I'm so sorry I bought this. I have a 3ds and I play a game that requires the sound to be in tune with the game and because of the audio lag I cannot play this game with Bluetooth headsets which was the whole purpose of me buying the transmitter to begin with. I have tried it with 5 different pairs of Bluetooth headphones and no luck. This is garbage to me until I can find another use for it.😤
5,I wish I would have bought this year's ago.
5,Works great! Small form factor surprisingly good battery life and range.
5,Very small and compact. Quick and easy set-up/pairing. Great audio quality with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. I use it in my 2012 Cadillac CTS-V and barely takes up room in the center console.
5,Best  bluetooth small  transmiter/receiver. Works very good!
5,Haven't used it a lot but what I have it has functions as expected.
5,Works like a charm! Sends audio output from radar detector to helmet Bluetooth unit. No problems with pairing.
3,While the sound quality is very good on this the latency (delay) is more noticeable than I would like. Kind of like watching a movie that has been translated.
5,connect headphones to bluetooth
5,Had a problem but their customer service person Bruce advises how to fix it. Works as advertised.
5,I use my TROND Bluetooth just as a receiver by connecting it to my old stereo tuner and playing music from my phone over my house stereo system.  Works every time and sounds great.
5,Works exactly as expected slick as can be. This unit much quicker to connect than the older unit it replaced.I use this to connect my iphone 4S to 3.5mm audio input.
5,Easy to use & I like that is small.
5,Wonderful I can now use my Classic ipod with the cool M&G headphones my niece gave me for Christmas! So tiny it fits in the armband holster and also it pairs easily.
5,This Trond BT-DUO transmitter/receiver coupled with the TD-BH01 headphones combination work extremely well and without any latency. Customer service is A++++
2,The item is great if you buy it for one speaker but does not keep the connection for two. The item drops the 2nd speaker within a few minutes after connecting. The distance is not more then 6 feet away from device so the long distance is really not long at all.
2,This unit is constantly turning off. When it does pair it takes at least 15 seconds and then does not always work. When it does connect the sound seems fine. I must return it though rather than experience the frustration of trying to get it operational every time I want to use it. I was hoping for something that could be set up once and just work.
1,I purchased this bluetooth splitter to watch movies on my iPad while on a plane.  I tested them at home first and found that every 1-2 minutes it drops the blue tool connection and you have to resync your headphones to theTROND transmitter. It is totally worthless.  I wish previous reviews would have written about this.  I tried it on my iPad and Windows laptop and both platforms experienced dropped bluetool connections.Look elsewhere or  you will be returning this item.
5,Using to receive surround sound from amp. The AptX feature provides no noticeable delay or reverberation effect.
5,I use this with my Nintendo Switch and wireless Bluetooth ear buds when I travel. Easy to install and use.
5,Excellent service from Trond staff really helpful and dealt with issue immediately and satisfactorily. Would recommend as a very good supplier.
2,Big issue for TX mode the device does not play any sound when the volume input is low. Giving an very unpleasant hearing experience of voice interruption where the low volume voice or background sound is cut off frequently during music and video playing.
2,Lasted about a weekThanks to Covid I did not respond in timeSigh 😔
5,Works great and connects up with my BT headphones for riding on the trainer and watching TV early in the morning when everyone is asleep.
3,It works but there's an audio lag between my TV and the audio coming out of my speaker. Not sure what's causing it.
2,HiI am experiencing a  noticeable audio delay even though the transmitter is marketed as Low Latency. I am using two TROND devices one as the transmitter  (that transmit the projector audio) and one as the receiver that  gets projector audio and push it to A speaker system.I am disappointed.Yoni
5,I used the receiver portion to stream tracks to a pa amplifier. It worked wonderfully.
5,pairs fast. charges fast. just plug it in for extended play. excellent sound from a cheap dvd player sent to my Bluetooth speaker.
5,After reviewing the various reviews I was concerned about the possible lag/latency watching movies. But from what I've experienced there is no noticeable lag when listening to the audio w/ bluetooth headsets and using this device.Love it!
2,I purchased this to transmit a bluetooth audio signal from the TV however the transmitter I received would not charge.  The company immediately offered an exchange or refund.  Based on many reviews for wireless transmitters in general I decided to go with a different transmitter that draws it's power from the TV.
5,I use this to stream audio from my iPhone to the Bose system installed in my 2012 Nissan Armada. It connects to the AUX input. It works seamlessly with clear audio.
5,Awesome product! Works great! The unit is being used to enable our Samsung smart TV to work with our Modern Portable Super66 wireless headphones. The Trond customer service is excellent. Will absolutely purchase products from these folks again.
5,This device has the best sound quality and is the most reliable of all the other RX/TX devices i have tried. It pairs easily and re-acquires consistently.I really am pleased.
5,ive originally bought this for the switch but now i am using it on my Pc at work and hom and any other device that does not have bluetooth
5,this worked well with my computer to my Amplifier.  I can play my music that's on my pc to my home amp
5,Good product. Well made. Quality materials. Performs as described. Easy to pair with my headset. Great for silent TV viewin!. I would buy this pro again. Also it was delivered promptly. MJ. Bayside NY.
5,Great! It worked perfectly for my Nintendo switch and my Powerbeats Pro.
2,Did not connect to speaker easily and the volume on the speaker was very low when it did connect. Does not connect to bluetooth devices at all now after having it for a few weeks.
5,The mini manual was helpful as I was trying to figure out what mode to put the transmitter receiver in.
5,It works great. Very strong connection very good sound... trouble free
1,Purchased this item to transmit TV audio out wirelessly to (TROND) headphones to replace wired headphone setup.Charged this item prior to use. Wall charger is NOT provided with unit. Will use that charger to continually charge unit avoiding inconvenience of weak battery.Used the unit with TROND headphones for first time last evening pairing was 'automatic' and sound through the headphones was GREAT.Unit FAILED only after a few days. Replaced by Vendor with second unit that also FAILED in a few days.
3,Works well however I find myself having to re-pair my device all the time which is somewhat inconvenient.
5,👌🏻
1,Will not pair with anything.  Tried pairing with four different sets of wireless earbuds all with no success.  All four sets of earbuds paired with three different smart phones so clearly the problem is the TROND.Update:  After initial review I was contacted by TROND customer service.  My issues were unable to be resolved and the company issued me a complete refund.
2,I received the BT-DUO S ADAPTER today and discovered that volume control buttons ONLY work in Receive mode. I needed it to also attenuate in Transmit mode. I didn't pick up the detail in the product description. This item works fine except volume control buttons ONLY work in Receive mode.I already have an earlier BT Duo that I'm satisfied with. This one will be going back however.
5,I wanted something that would easily allow me to use my IPOD Classic with Bluetooth speakers.  This does the trick!  Great range and endurance!  Would highly recommend to others who are technically challenged.
5,Su tamano y simplicidad  de uso
5,I bought this product to replace a bluetooth receiver that I have for two years. It works fine it is easy to use and it is small I can carry in my pocket.
4,It is working great. Love it.
5,used to connect headphones to PC
5,bought this to keep using my Bose Noise Cancelling corded headphones with Google Pixel XL 2. Great result great audio quality easy pairing.
5,Great follow up from Trond.  It makes a high tech product easy to use.
5,Very light and easy to use，My car has no Bluetooth and I use this to receive signal from my phone. work good now.
5,Easy to set up pairs fast with headphones
3,Like the Headline says this is a solid product.  Pairs easily good fidelity small size.  Just too much lag for live instruments.
5,I was able to pair this TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter Receiver with my Bose QC35 headphones (which required Bluetooth version 4.1 compatibility) .I thought the documentation for this TROND device was good.
5,Easy to use. Works as promised . Small size use almost anywhere. Excellent sound quality.
5,Small and easy to use.  Battery life seems good.
5,VERY EASY TO USE AND SMALL WITH QUICK SHIP AND VERY CLEAR RECEPTION
4,OK
5,Arrived today.  Plugged into my Panasonic TV.  Since my TV has only the optical output I used an adapter I had for my wired headphones.  Appears to work well.  I have no complaints.
1,Volume is 10% of normal at best if you try and use it while charging with  distortion and crackling that are unbelievably bad.  I don't know what kind of cheap parts are used but wow this was horrid.  Works OK if not being charged but that is NOT how it is described
2,We bought this to pair two LG headphones at the same time. It works at first when it comes off the charger but as soon as we loose connection it is impossible to re-pair both headsets again. Often when it is able to pair there is too much crackling and intermittent connectivity. I haven't tried it with any other uses.
5,Connects easily and has good range.
5,Se conecta fácilmente a los audífonos y la calidad del sonido es excelente
5,Worked well for connecting my AirPods to many sources.
5,Provides Bluetooth 5.0 transmit and receive capabilities to audio devices that lack it
5,I wasn't sure if it was going to work well enough. I was so glad when it did.
5,This little piece of equipment works like a charm. I use it so I can listen to CD audio books on my CD player to Bluetooth headphones and it works perfectly. I love it
5,Great product. Could only be better if it could receive and transmit simultaneously
2,When it connected the sound was great and I had no problems. However I often could not get it to connect. When it did connect it took me at least 30 minutes of trying. I highly don’t recommend buying this product.
5,Very versatile. Great range. Taking me to the next gen bluetooth realm!
5,I travel a lot and purchased this for my overseas flight. Only used it once so far and worked flawlessly.
1,i bought 2 units of Trond 2 Duo S before and it works pretty good ...really happy with them..so i decided to buy an extra one a bit cheaper (BT DUO)  but it came defective and one of the channels doesn't work.I believe this has been an honest QC mistake.Anyway would be great that Trond could provide a good product even if is a bit cheaper. ..QC has to be a bit more efficient. The BT DUO S is great this one disappointed me a bit about Trond!.
5,I am using this product with a Samsung TV and Bose Quiet Comfort 35 Bluetooth Headphones. The sound and syncing with the video is perfect. I couldn't be happier.
5,Very handy item for connecting any non-bluetooth device that has a headphone jack to your wireless headphones and still have them be wireless.  Small and easy to carry.  This is a lifesaver for me!
5,Item as described. Connected easily and works. Now we no longer have to listen to the tv at full volume. The hard-of-hearing can use their bluetooth headphones! Thank you so much. Great product
5,Exactly what I needed - works as expected
2,Max volume is very low.  Almost unusable in airplane (exactly why I purchased this).
5,Easy to use lots of support from seller. Would buy again
5,This Bluetooth Transceiver works as advertised; provides connectivity to Bluetooth headphones everywhere I walk in my home.  I recommend this product. I have linked this to Avantree Over Ear Headphones.
5,Easy to set up and been working 100% for years.  I'd buy another !
5,Works well and easy to set up
5,Easy to setup and worked great using bose qc35 bluetooth with nintendo switch.
4,It works with wonders but can't use while charging.
5,Connects fast and works great on an airplane!
5,TV to stereo to headphones
5,Works very good as advertised. I use it a lot when I don't want to disturb others while watching the game.
4,distance is minimal
2,Keeps loosing connection when unit is placed in my pocket! That is only maybe 3 feet from my ear pieces.
5,Great!!!!!
5,What a great way to pass all of the music on the computer in iTunes to my wireless headphones. Easiest pairing I've ever seen fantastic and so easy to use.
1,This product was extremely useful and was going to receive a good review from my use. That was until it broke seemingly out of nowhere. After about a month of owning this it now will no longer power on. The worst part of this is a I am unable to receive a refund or a replacement. Don't chance this.
5,Minimal delay to be not noticeable used with a metal detector to provide wireless connection connected to Bluetooth and both held the charge for the several hours spent hunting without issues.
2,Seems like a nice product  ---- if only I can get it to work with my  receiver or cable box or tv.  I'm sure there's something I'm doing wrong but I have tried every possible connection with hopes of it working.  Will continue to try different setups but not optimistic.
5,This transmitter is awesome. Bluetooth sound quality is excellent and for the price it performs very well. You can't really tell that the voices are off at all. I would highly recommend this transmitter.
5,Works great with my ipod nano.
3,Still not fast enough to use with remote speakers for TV.  TV speakers themselves must be muted or use the TROND in the earphone jack.
5,Received it in great condition and is working on my motorcycle great. I can listen to my internet radio finally due to buying a new Bluetooth only phone.
5,Excelente  compraré otro más inmediatamente.
5,Device is used as a BT transmitter with no issues.
1,Apparently almost impossible to get 2 bluetooth headsets connected at once. Couldn't get it to work with BT 4.0 4.5 and 5.0 headsets.Why advertise it like it's a main feature when in actuality there are stipulations on getting the feature to work.I'd have much rather bought bought the other model that they discretely recommend over this product. That's shady lol
5,A very good equipment.
5,I got my old turntable (which only had RCA outputs) set up broadcasting to a bluetooth speaker through this in about 5 minutes.
5,quick on receiving and paired easily to Sony headphones. transition is good and music sounds great.
1,I could not get this to pair with any of my Bluetooth headphones. What a waste of money
5,You can put equalizer through it !
5,Excellent transmitter. Would buy again.
5,Works great with my boom box and ISOtunes ear plugs
4,beeps when not in use
1,Upset I bought it because I have a baby in my house but it won't connect it did before for a day but not again. The sound has a lot of fuzz as well.
5,My husband swears this thing is the best thing ever!
4,Works as described
5,Using on stage with soundpeats...zero delay...background hiss not a big deal
3,You need to pair your divices every time that you turn on the bluetooth.It doesn't save the info of any divice.After that everything is OK.
5,This worked great just what I needed to sync my older MP 3 player to my Sony Boom Box  .
2,I tried to couple my I-pad with a Bose A20 aviation headset.  Everything worked fine except for volume.  I cranked everything up and still could barley hear anything.  I put the unit in the "maybe tomorrow" drawer hoping for another application with greater results.
5,My son loves it
5,Works like it should. I used it with my tablet and two headsets. On a roadtrip so I could entertain my children. An it worked flawlessly.
2,I had a lot of troubles connecting it to a phone or a headset but when I did the sound quality was pretty good and it lasted longer than i thought
5,This works well with their Bluetooth receiver. I don't notice any latency and it's so small I can tape it on the back of the LED TV. Easy to pair.
4,Minor setup issue.  Good product.
5,I'm using it right now to listen to music from a device on the other side of the house. Great product!
5,It works well with my headphones
5,One set of headphones works great but second headphones are hard to connect
1,Fairly easy to set up even with 2 blue tooth connections. Worked reasonably well for about 3-4 weeks then dropped the ability to pair with second headset. 2 days later just stopped functioning all together. The ability to hold a charge was sporadicI cannot recommend this for any regular use.
5,Great product to use your blue tooth speakers and it has a good range to what a big plus.
5,Simple interface. Works great!
5,This works great with my SHARP AQUOS TV. Love that I can broadcast music or sports outside. Great value!
5,This item works well.  I attach to the rear of my Yamaha speaker dock to use with my IPod and iPhone works like a charm.
1,did not connect with my sprinter radio set up. can not return because i missed amazons return window. cheap china crap like so much on amazon.
5,It's awesome! I didn't expect that it's so cool and pretty as it is.
5,Turned my Ipod classic into bluetooth when at work. Last for quite a while before recharge. Great product!
1,High Latency issue. I specifically bought this one for its apparent (low latency). I don't what universe this is that this product isconsidered low latency but its clearly noticeable. Using AptX low latency bluetooth headphones to go with it (linked below) so no... I'm not so stupid as to pair an AptX low latency device with headphones lacking that feature . The latency is so disruptive and jarring I just can't use this for what I needed it for and is useless to me. Very unsatisfiedhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EN3IJ6G/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
2,When using the Trond unit in TX mode while charging it the Trond  introduces HUM onto the source device (JUKEBOX). Disconnecting the the charge cord from the TROND makes the HUM go away.
5,This works perfect I actually use Velcro that what I can attach it to my Switch.
1,I connected it from a mini amp to two different headsets.  On both sets there was over a 1-second delay.  This device cannot be used to play guitar so if that's why you want to buy it don't bother.  Go old school and just use headphones with a wire.
5,I love this product. No softwares to install just plug and play.
5,This does just what I hoped.  I have it hooked up to my stereo receiver and my phones bluetooth connects to it effortlessly.  Fantastic.
1,Purchased two of these. One worked perfectly. The other one connects fine but has an excruciating buzz making the unit unusable. Tried everything. Finally relized its one bad device. The other one works well as both a Tx & Rx and connects to any other Bt device. Not worth the effort to return one.
5,Good!1.Nice sound quality both in TX and RX mode.2.Very easy to use.3.Compact and nice assembly.4. High C/P ratio.
5,I use this for my QC35's I am amazed on the range of this device. I can walk all throughout my cubical style office and it works flawlessly.
5,Pairing can be a bit difficult to figure out at first but it works well as a transmitter with my iPod and pairs to my Bose wireless headphones. Very happy with purchase.
5,I use it for my ath-m50s and it's great for long hours of work with no cables limiting your movement.
5,Great Product! Works like a champ. Very compact as well!
2,Well either this unit or the headset would not allow good volume and I had to re-charge every couple hrs.  No good for TV watching which was the only application.  Their support was pretty good as they did get a stream going with me to help my initially understand how to install the product.
5,I use it to play games on Nintendo switch with wireless headphones.
5,Great product and amazing customer service!
1,The unit I received was obviously a return based on the scratches on the connector end of the case. I plugged it in to a USB charger (not included) to charge per the instructions. Hours later I tried the unit. Nothing. Tried charging again. Long story short: the unit arrived with a bad charging cable.I waited too long to return the unit so I am SOL.
5,Works great! I'm using it as a transmitter for my TV for playing video games. Allows me to use my bluetooth headset. Quality is awesome really nothing bad to say about this thing.
3,This connected easily.  I have quite a few walls so sometimes the range is limited.
5,My mother uses this to watch TV. Have not heard any complaints from her.
5,The answer to my iPod classic I refuse to let go of. I can now play my songs via Bluetooth. The product is flawless.
5,It works!
5,Works as expecred
5,Very easy to connect to radio in my truck
4,Great!
5,Works well - easy to operate
5,This actually works pretty well.  For a little device does what I needed it to do.
5,It works well I am using it as a receiver.  Plays great but lost one side playback once and repaired it now working fine again.
4,Excellent with my PSP 3001
5,Works perfectly for transmitting audio to my BT earphones from TV's airplanes etc.
4,Works very well.
3,It keeps connecting to whatever BT device is available and not only to those two I set up.
5,Used to connect speaker 2 projector works like it should
5,Works as described. Used this to sync two speakers worked great
5,Wonderful product. My husband is hard of hearing and now he can listen to his shows without having the tv volume up so loud. Would recommend to everyone who has this problem!
5,Very easy to use and very simple for those who are not tech savvy.
5,I love my TROND! Its perfect for listening to the tv without disturbing others in the household. Easy to connect and set-up plus the battery life is excellent. Money well spent. Highly recommended.
2,The biggest problem I have with this is static. I get static humming buzzing squeeling. The distance i2 10-15 feet with some blind spots even while in sight of the base . . and it does not go through walls. Coupling is problematic taking several attempts before coupled.
4,Good excellent bluetooth speaker.
5,Works Flawless with the my Switch Lite.
5,Took it out of the box plugged into the back of the TV Within 15 seconds it's synced to my wireless headphones. couldn't have been easier I highly recommend it...
1,After spending many hours trying to pair these headphones and transmitter and could not get it working.  Had a friend who owns the local computer business come today and she was unsuccessful as well.  She recommends that I return these items.  I have contacted the seller and the only response I get is exactly what the instruction manual states.  Not helpful at all!
5,exactly as described. Im 2 of these as a transmit/receive/AD converter for pro drums on Rock band rivals hooked to td25kv works great!
4,Works great!!!!
2,Product doesn’t show up in list of Bluetooth devices!! I have tried countless times troubleshooting and still no connection!!!
5,I had success sending music from SeriusXM to another room via my Trond transmitter.
2,I'm not sure what the issue is but I bought this product to pair with my Jaybird Bluebuds. However after reading the directions for both and repeatedly trying to pair them (TROND transmitting to earbuds) they will not connect. They may work perfectly with other brands but for now they don't work with Bluebuds.
5,Only used in transmit mode so far. But works.
5,Works great. Bluetooth still has some audio quality issues but most people would never notice it in their everyday use. This is just a limitation of the technology not the manufacturer.
5,I use this when I teach spin class. Allows me to keep phone on the bike without wires getting in the way. Works perfectly.
5,Great gift
2,Purchased based on the high reviews but it never worked. Fully charged it followed the instruction but it never paired. Very disappointed.UPDATE:- I upgraded my rating only because of great customer service who contacted me gave a refund. Will purchase another one to see how it works and update this rating accordingly.
5,Easy to setup and link to my Bose headphones.Absolutely painless process done in seconds.Very happy with this. Now I can listen to the TV without waking the whole family.
5,It just works with no delay as a receiver. I do not use it as a Transmitter.
5,I thought I had a problem but I did a reset as listed on Amazon and works perfectly again.
5,As advertised works great
1,I followed EVERY instruction tutorial suggestion and random google solution I could find and nothing made this device work.  (I also tried every variation in setting just to ensure I didn't have it backwards and it still didn't work.)
5,Fantastic product. Small compact awesome price works very well great battery easy to use/understand and pairs quickly once turned on. Highly recommend.
1,I would give this product a negative amount of stars if I could. Absolutely did not work no matter what we tried. Total waste of time!
5,Works fantastic . Long battery life.
5,Works excellent on a Win 7 laptop with wireless headphones can walk 1 or 2 rooms away without losing signal unlike the USB bluetooth devices that have no range.
5,Strong signal. Easy to use. I bought this because I work late night at home. This way I can watch TV without upsetting the house. Last about 10 hours.
5,Awesome product and very practical. One big hit are the accesories included specially the 3.5 mm male to male plug
5,Muy buen producto en calidad y precio
4,happy
4,Did not work.
5,It just does what it is suppose to...works well with Bose products
5,It worked great getting ready to buy another
5,Good design; very small package; and most importantly - works well.  I don't have a great of comparative experience; but this seems to be  very good and a good value.
5,Works as advertised.  Just what I needed to receive dash radios programs outside of my vehicle.  Nice range.
1,This product is quite difficult to use and is not user friendly.  I almost got it to work...once but the volumes on the two headphones were very different.  Was unable to get two bluetooth headphones to work again. I ended up having to buy a different bluetooth transmitter made by another company that worked much better. I would not recommend this product.
5,Has very nice range!  I can get further away from this transmitter than I could when just paired with my bluetooth headphones.
5,Great
5,Does what it should.
2,The latency is terribleCannot use it to watch tvCannot use it to play with a bandListening to music is ok
5,Plug and play
5,Works great
5,I love this.  I wear headphones at night and this is perfect  I had bought another brand that didn't do have the job and kept dropping the signal
5,Works great
5,I needed a Bluetooth transmitter so I could watch TV late at night and not wake up the family. This transmitter worked flawlessly. Great find!
5,Works great !
5,Works great.
5,Ok
5,Just as expected!
5,Great product
5,Just what I wanted. Low cost easy set up and works great.
5,Easy plug and play setup. Small and compact reviever and transmitter to turn wired into wireless really nice no-frills Bluetooth solution.
5,Works perfectly for TV low latencyIt does work while connected to charger with no issues
5,Works exactly as expected. Clear sound quality and no hassle with Win10 ruined Bluetooth capabilities anymore.
2,Sound quality is good and audio delay is barely noticeable. Problem I have is that it just randomly doesn't work. It either wont pair with the headphones or no audio comes out. I have to fumble with turning it off and on for 20 mins before it decides to work.
5,A bit of learning curve but I now have 2 of these. good range
5," Does exactly what I wanted good battery life lasted easily 7 hour flight and functioned perfectly"
2,Was working great and now it doesn't connect to any of our phones or Bose systems! Any advice on what can be done in order to get it to work or get a replacement?? Please let me know. Thx Milan
5,This thing works as described. Would recommend.
5,It's exactly what I need to make my switch bluetooth
5,Product works well for streaming iPad movies to multiple bluetooth headphones. No noticeable latency. Plus if ever needed customer service goes above and beyond.
5,Works flawlessly with everything I've thrown at it.  Not much else to say but that it is small has good battery life and it works.
5,Works with Beats Studio 2’s wireless. Pairing was easy
5,I've ordered a couple other brand Bluetooth adapters in the past but they were low quality. This one is really easy to use and connects to my phone fast.
5,Love it. Great range. Great sound with aptx. Use it with my m-100 headphones/v20 phone when I want wireless  and the occasional receiver use.
5,Plugged it in followed the enclosed directions and it worked on the first try.  What's not to like?
5,Tried two others (not Tron) and had to return then but third one was a charm.No noticable lag on TV and. Paired easily.
5,Worked perfectly and easily the first time. Very nice product simple to use works very well!!
5,Easy to set up - even for this old grandma. Works well.  Added Bluetooth connectivity to our TV to work with my husband's hearing aids.
5,Works great with my Bose noise canceling earbuds for airlines!
5,Easily paired to Anker SoundBuds Curve Bluetooth 4.1 aptX. Working very well so far.
5,Great for podcasts not good enough sound quality for music though
5,Very easy to setup and connect
5,Works wonderfully. I have an iPod classic and a bluetooth speaker. This works way better than bluetooth from my computer to the speaker.
5,Works as advertised.
5,I use this product with a Bose Bluetooth Head Set and it is easy to setup and functions very well. It's perfect for a TV otherwise not Bluetooth capable.
5,It connects my Bluetooth speaker to my projector perfectly
5,I’m very happy with this for the money. Works as advertised.
3,Cannot charge and use at same time. If that's a feature you need get a TaoTronics instead.
5,Handy device. It not only paired with my iPhone iPad but also with my bluetooth speakers iHome Big Blue JBL Flip2 and Ecoxgear.
1,Bought 2 of these to use one as a receiver and one as a transmitter that is connected to the aux in on speaker so that i could take advantage of the aptX LL function and reduce lag.  The delay is worse using one as a receiver than connecting the Bluetooth speaker direct.  I will be returning both.  They say that the aptX ll feature was added after May 1 but i don't believe this.
5,👍🏼
5,Always connected.
5,Works Great. Highly recommended!
5,So far everything I've used it on works wonderful. No problem charging  for pairing it to other devices. I would definitely recommend it to others I like it
1,Connected to my tv headphone jack transmitted to my earbuds and the constant static that kicked in made the whole thing unusable. Waste of money.
5,Won’t last all day
5,I have bluetooth headphones for my phone and use this to listen to TV--excellent.
5,Great unit and very clear. I actually bought two of them. One to transmit from the bedroom tv and the other to receive from my iPhone into my stereo.
5,Small and works well now all my devices are Bluetooth capable. Great value.
5,I bought this to use with my Nintendo Switch and it works excellent! I love it!
5,I had to return 3 different models before setting on this transmitter. It works great. Longest range no delay between picture and sound and doesn't disconnect unexpectedly.
5,Great way to update an old stereo to link to phones and tablets
5,This works perfectly - I love it that my older TV & older devices can be listened to now with my Bluetooth earbuds !!!!!
5,works great - simple to operate and makes it easy to receive bluetooth transmissions from non-bluetooth devices (gym TVs and my iPod).
1,I ordered this product to make my 2010 Toyota Prius aux in a bluetooth connection. Everything seemed nice and the device connected easily. However when I test playing music the sound quality was very poor and compressed.I ordered this device as a replacement and it has great sound quality.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSUWCZ0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Hope this helps
5,using one in tx mode to deliver tv audio to headset connected to other in rx mode. Lots of volume to my ear
1,I followed the guide on pairing these to Apple Airpods with no success even reset both the transmitter & airpods with no success. Not sure if I received a faulty unit but it doesn't work for the one intended purpose I bought these for
5,Ok it is ok. Working. It is my fault. I am cancelling return item.
5,Works great no lag at all and simple to connect devices
5,Great product
5,Works well for audio transmission and the long distance.
5,The device is working as advertised. The best part is that there is no discernible lag with the sound from my TV to my bluetooth headphones.
5,Worked just fine with my old ipod that didn't have bluetooth.
5,Fast service and well made product.
1,Did not work for what we needed
5,Works very well easy to pair with my IPOD Classic to my Bose Wireless headphones
5,No latency at all. Used it to play zelda botw with external bose speaker.
5,Great product
5,Good
5,Terrific little device. Easy to operate and lasts with intermittent use from full charge about 5 hours before it needs to be recharged.
5,This is great. I hooked it up to my Bose radio and let it transmit to a Bose Bluetooth speaker.  Very happy with this purchase
1,Connects pretty quickly when working.  Bought 2.  Bought worked correctly for a while. But now 1 of 2 comes on and then just shuts down. Battery shows charged but I'm wondering if battery just is not charging up anymore.  Can't recommend with a 50 percent working ratio.
1,Have not managed to get them connected to my Sennhauser headphones so no idea how volume control or sound quality is. Luckily it was electronic recycling trash day in the neighborhood that's where it went right away.
5,Excellent will buy again.
5,Used it to listen to in-flight movie on my Bose Bluetooth headphones
5,Simple and effective does what it claims very well.
2,EASY TO SET UP AND CONECT BUT HAD ISSUES AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS AND WOULD NOT CONNECT AT ALL AFTER 30 DAYS. Amazon issued refund.
5,works as advertised
5,Ease
1,I bought this to add Bluetooth functionality to the Nintendo Switch so I could use my wireless Beats headphones. They paired but even at max volume the volume was much too low to be enjoyed. Plus there was often a hissing sound from interference.  These were a huge disappointment. The Trond needs some kind of small amplifier to provide enough juice for usable volume.
1,I paired this device with my blue tooth speaker as well as my blue tooth headphones.  I get nothing!  no sound (although the speaker/headphones are "connected."  Now what?
5,Super
5,Works like a charm!  I plug it into my work computer and can walk 35-40 feet in any direction without losing connection on my bluetooth headphones.
5,My search for a Bluetooth Adapter is over. I am getting very good sound quality and its very easy to use. Will buy from this company again.
2,It worked adequately with my mp3 player at gym but battery wouldn't recharge after few months.
5,I notice a very small lag when using for TV viewing with headphones but it is barely noticeable really.
1,Even when plugged into a device that has volume control such as a computer the outputted volume is too low even when said computer is at 100% volume.
1,Pay a little more of this thing is a piece of crap.
1,Had success connecting bose 350 headphones alone but never able to do the same with my Mpow 059. I did reset and reconnect with fresh trond device - same result. So no chance connecting two headphones at the same time for me have to return item.
5,Best item ever! Works with my iPod and wireless headphones Beats and Bose
5,It works beautifully.Pairing to headphones is a bit complex however it is worth the effort.
5,they are just awesome. They sync instantly the quality of sound is great 0 delay.....PERFECT BLUETOOTH both as transmitter and receiver
5,Just what I wanted.  Dancing with my Wife and no one hears.  Easy instructions and they work as advertised
3,Hard to set up maybe it was just me
5,Nice product. Small and functional. It was easy to pair with headphones and came with some patch-cables etc. Probably going to get another one soon.
5,Works amazingly well and the battery life is awesome8+ hour trip and still going strong two thumbs up
5,Works perfectly with my ancient iPod classic.
5,Item works perfectly.  Setup is simple and once the two bluetooth headphones are connected they stay connected.  We have had no problems what-so-ever!!
5,Purchased another one not from Trond & it wasn't very good. Sent it back & got this one. Wow. Clear no static no delay love it!
5,Great product love it!  No delay.  Will buy another in the future if there is ever a need.
1,Sound and volume are horrible
5,Works perfect. I needed to broadcast my phone audio to 2 bluetooth speakers simultaneously. Does the trick and I don't notice any lag.
5,Works great.  I will recommend to family and friends
5,Worked very well
5,Hooked it up to my Samsung TV and pared with head phones no problems works fine.
5,This works exactly like the manual describes and I use it a lot.
5,I've been in the music service industry for over 15 years.  This is the first bluetooth receiver with lossless sound quality.  A+
2,Used 1 time now won't charge just red light then off. Garbage don't purchase
5,Easy connectability. Used it in my in-flight movie-watching.
1,This Bluetooth doesn't work!!!
5,I can sum it up in a couple of words....Works great and was relatively cheap for what it does.
5,Tiny but can send and receive a bluetooth signal.  What more needs to be said?
5,This paired with our in ceiling speakers immediately. It is an easy set up and great product.
5,Works great. I have it plugged into my Stereo's headphone jack for use with TV and my game system (going through my stereo).
5,Works great between TV & wireless headphones. Easy installation.
5,Easy to set up sounds great.  Very pleased.  May buy another one.
5,This is a great product to have. I have used it both as a trx and rsx. works perfectly and am veery happy.
1,I bought this specifically for TV; however the latency was horrible. Video and sound didn't match. This may be good for listening to sound only.
5,Works pretty good
5,Fácil de instalar
5,In a fly I used it 9 hours  and it worked perfect
5,Purchased to limit latency issues. Works great
1,Tried pairing with Plantronics headphones and a bluetooth ear piece and it doesn't pick up either of them despite being unpaired with any other device and in pairing mode. Reset each several times but it would not pair.
5,This product works exactly as advertised. it's just a little hard to read the tiny font of the instructions.
5,Works as it should. Thank You!
5,Using this on my Yamaha Venture. Just plug it into the aux jack and stream music from my phone with Bluetooth.
1,I tried using this on a number of old “non-Bluetooth-enabled” iPods; and it didn’t work on any of them.I tried syncing all of them with two different Bluetooth speakers but there was no sound for any of them.
5,the trond works great. I am using it to turn my Honda Goldwing Bluetooth and it is working perfectly.
5,Steller product! The build is a tank so small so powerful. The bar is set.
5,Works great
5,The sound quality is awesome. This is a great way to add Bluetooth to electronics that would otherwise have you tethered.
2,Lip delay too much !!!
5,Works as advertised and easy to use. I had no trouble pairing it with my bluetooth headphones. Sound quality is good.
5,For my boombox
5,my old Panasonic Viera plasma in our bedroom doesn't have Bluetooth. This works great with my Bose Soundlink headphohnes. great tiny product!
5,Works great using it on the audio out ports on the receiver.  Hook-up was easy with cables provided.
1,Don't waste your time with this one.  Not for home use...terrible buzzing sound while it was plugged in.  Clipping and frequency distortions all throughout the movie i watched.  VERY cheaply made.  They claim to have a good product but I found it to be junk.
5,I love this little gadget. It brings my 1974 Yamaha CR800 receiver up to date!
2,Only worth it if your using for headphones.  Speakers do not work in sync and you can hear the lag between them.  Also annoying that sound does not match video.
5,An excellent product! It's great for long trips on my BMWK1600GTL because it works while charging!
2,Didn't like it.  Sent them back.  Keep disconnecting from the headphone and had to repair them over and over again.
2,Worked for about a month stop charging up so I threw it out the window in Macon Georgia went to Best Buy and bought a real one
5,Love it...simple small and sweet!
1,Stopped charging after just one month of use. Can't recommend an item that's so poor.
5,Excellent product.  Check others before you make a mistake.  This is latest model of Bluetooth was manufactured recently.
3,Have to repair every time I unhook & re hook it
5,It's awesome
5,Works great. If you follow the directions for pairing and resets there is not an issue with pairing.
5,Great easy to sync
1,El delay de transmisión es muy alto psra los fines que me interesa usarlo (como medio inalámbrico de In-ears). A pesar de que es un equipo útil el retraso en la recepción del sonido lo hace inútil para el fin descrito.
5,Attached it to my Sansa MP3 player.  Now I no longer have a headphone lead to contend with.  Nice!
5,This thing works great!  So easy to connect and use.  Thank you!!
5,Amazing product works as a transmitter or a receiverand sounds come out clear from the device you pair it up to.
5,Bought to use with my Switch exceeded expectations.
5,This device is easy to setup use and enjoy.
5,Easily to get stared and use.  I have had no problems since I have started using.
1,This thing has horrible sound quality.  Sounded like it was in a barrel.. had to crank the volume up to hear anything.  Would not recommend.
5,absolutely perfect. Hooked up two separate bluetooth headphones in a matter of minutes.  Has worked flawlessly since!
5,I like this small device it works great.
5,Worked well
5,Works great specially to use two bluetooth headsets to watch the same movie on an iPad.
1,Just did not work with my phone
5,Easy setup with great results just what I needed for an older sound system. Freedom from cord connected hassles.
5,nice product
5,Strong signal👍
3,Output volume was a little low borderline unusable.
5,This works perfectly! (I am glad this was much smaller than I expected.)
5,Love it!  Tiny size and works great!
5,Works great with my shuffle for workouts.
5,Easy to use and set up. Seamless connection to PC and home TV. Win win.
1,Completely unusable; has a terrible back feed echo and intermittent buzzing noise.
5,Reliable
2,Keeps dropping signal
5,Easy to set up  and works well
5,I needed to set up and play two speakers from one device and this one does that perfectly.
5,Good product.
2,This transmitter will not pair with my brand new bluetooth headphones no matter how many times I follow the provided instructions. Contacted the seller but they couldn't help me. Returned.
5,This product is great. Worked exactly as I wanted
5,I am using it to transmit tv audio to bluttooth and it works nicely ... 5 stars from me
5,Compact and amazing
2,Works once connected. Takes a month to connect. Battery life sucks. You have to constantly double tap to get it searching and hope eventually it'll connect.
2,Product did not work.
3,We have not been able to get this working yet.
5,Works great!!!!!!!!!
5,Worked great and no lag. If you get lag it isn't this devices fault.
2,Good device  but I was under the impression that you could add as many Bluetooth devices as you wanted can't seem to be able to do this.
5,Love it!  Would prefer that it lasted longer.
5,Great
3,Good
5,Works great and customer service was awesome.
5,It came with all the necessary cables. I hooked it up and it did it's thing. It works

5,I was amazed at how small it is.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to use.
5,Product works well.  Fast delivery.  Thanks!
5,I use this with my ipod classic and it works perfectly.
2,This Bluetooth transmitter worked great until today and then it just stopped working. I would have hoped it would last longer than 6 months.
5,Works great! It saved me a lot of money I didn't have to buy a new IPod.
1,The idea is fantastic connection was fine--The sound quality was absolutely terrible.  I don't know if all portable bluetooth receivers have this issue but I would rather use a cord than deal with the poor audio quality.  Returning this today.
3,connection could be improved
5,Very nice product it's  small  high quality nice design long life battery.
1,Well I guess you really don't always get what pay for.  This would not pair the TV with my Bose headset. I tried at least a dozen times.  It paired the TV with a cheap shelf speaker and the latency was ridiculously apparent.  I only wanted to watch TV using the headset.  Waste of money.
5,Very good product I is compatible with all my devices radio tv iPhone. It very good for the price.
5,Perfect for my back patio Hook up to the cable box. Listen to sports  outside
5,Links easily with the headphones. So far so good!!
5,It did everything it was supposed to do for me I'm satisfied very satisfied
5,works flawlessly 3months later
5,Arrived as described. Works great.
5,It was easy to set up and works like a charm at home and in the car
2,Hard to connect it does not reconnect to my headphones once paired unless I hit the pair function every time.I am returning this product.
2,Was a PIA to get working then never worked again.  Don't bother
5,It works very well but I wish it kept a charge longer.
2,Very disappointed! Had this product for 3months and it’s not working any more! Really!!!
1,Almost a full second of latency.  Returning mine
5,Fantastic little device with very good battery life. Sound is clear and crisp; no background interference.
5,Works great. I like the distance it works also.
2,Audio quality much worse than v4.1
5,Does exactly what its supposed to. Simple and effective
2,Got this as a way to use my wireless head phones in my recording studio. The latency was ridiculous (> 1 sec) Waste of money
5,works great
5,Works great.  Connects quickly and audio quality is awesome
5,Works exactly as promised.  Well worth what I paid for it.  Very easy to set up.

5,“  A+++ great product seller etc!!! Thank you!!! ”
5,Works great. Easy program. Company shows how they care with there response on my happiness.
5,the product works great. easy to use good quality connection.
1,It was GOING to be used for a TV but u have to be a genius to hook it up !!! So it sits n the junk drawer!!
1,I attached it to a TV and it worked okay for about 2 weeks although I did notice some lag. Then it stopped working altogether. The lights came on but it would not pair with my headphones. The headphones still pair with my phone and laptop so I figured it must be the TROND.
1,Did not work
5,For car
5,The low latency is great and it works great with my tv.
1,I was able to pair it with a UE Boom bluetooth speaker and it worked the very first time I tried it. I have not been able to get it to transmit any sound since then. It's paired and the music is playing on my phone but no sound is coming out of the speaker.
1,I so badly wanted this to work.  We were using it to listen to our tv while sitting outside by pairing it with our jambox speakers.  Unfortunately this would not pair (despite my efforts for over an hour) so for now this is just a paper weight.
5,Worked as advertised and easy setup. It's very small.
5,Works Great turned my older soundbar into Great Bluetooth soundbar and saved me money..
5,Took awhile to pair. But now works like a charm. Thank you!
5,Works as described.  Perfect for transmitting TV programs to a Bluetooth ear piece.  Great product.

5,The devise is working very well and I'm very pleased with it.
5,Great product
5,Works well and paired easily with my bluetooth headphones.
5,Works with QC35
1,Whenever my Sony bluetooth speaker is connected with the device I can hear static noise. The noise is not loud but very irritating. Now I have to give up the device.
5,I haven't connected it with two devices but with one it works great.
1,This product has interference with my TV and the Bluetooth speaker I sent multiple emails with no corrected problem this was a waste of my money
2,Lasted only a few months then won't connect.
1,Inaccurate if you are buying to weigh mg. It is about 5 to 15mg off. I know it may not seem a lot but itdepends on how accurate you need it to be. I tested this against other mg scales at my lab and it's a waste of money.
1,I am very happy with the adapter. I've had it for around two months now and I haven't had any issues so far. I would definitely recommend this product.Updating my review. It does not hold it's charge now. I contacted the seller but they won't send me new one. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
5,Works very well
5,Easy to understand easy to pair Earplugs stay in. What more could I ask for?
2,DIDN'T WORK WITH SONY BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES
5,Definitely recommend this!
1,The Trond would not pair with my phone Galaxy S4. My phone could not pick up its signal at all. Instructions were somewhat cumbersome (not straight forward). Everything was connected as stated in instructions. I really hoped this product would resolve the problem of not having a bluetooth stereo in my car.
1,A bit disappointing. It was tricky to connect and the directions were vague. There is too much of a lag time for my purposes.
5,Works perfect used on my bike in truck and tv no complaints what so ever
1,tried it with my Sanyo tv it didn't work. Tried it with my Magnavox smart tv and still didn't work.
1,Worked great the two times I got to use it now it won't charge and the only way I can use it is to keep it plugged in. Wouldn't recommend.
5,Excelente producto recibe y transmite con muy buena fidelidad con un rango de alcance amplio.

1,I have not been able to get this to work/sync up with my tv and wireless Bluetooth headphones.  Also was disappointed that it is something that has to be charged assumed it would be always plugged in to the wall.
2,Doesn't work well. Staticky and won't sync to 2 speakers.
1,I returned this product.  In spite of a multitude of instructions including email I could not get this device to pair or actually do anything.  Not worth the hassle.

1,Easily one of the worst products I've bought. Complicated instructions with limited function for pairing. Works then doesn't work. Not worth it.
5,so far so good
5,worked like a charmeasy set uphappy camper.
1,Literally stopped working in 5 minutes. Had it hooked up to xm satellite receiver to bridge between receiver and older stereo.
1,In a couple months of use the Bluetooth only plays music out of one speaker in my car.
1,Pairing multiple headsets is a ridiculous process... buy something else. There are cheaper options that are MUCH easier to pair.
1,Worked for 4 days and now won't connect to anything. I can't return it because my dog ate the box

4,I specifically got this for my Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. If you use the native Bluetooth options in the headset it can lead to issues with frame drops in games like Beat Saber. I got this to work around those issues. It does work pretty well! I had to max out the latency to 300ms which isn’t ideal but gets the job done when I have friends over and we are playing. It doesn’t connect to all devices because some require a screen to select the device. Most do work though.
4,This tranceiver (so they call it) is a really handy device. it is easy to use and it's very useful function wise. You can either use it as a transmitter or receiver. Pairing with devices is easy as long as you follow the instructions. Keep in mind some devices might unpair other devices meaning while pairing it with one device it might lose connection with the other. Something that is very crucial is the battery life in my experience it is as long as 3 consecutive hours. Another thing to bear in mind is the cable while using the included cable (charging the tranceiver while using it) it might cause disruption at least with my wireless BT headphones (Sennheiser Momentum 2). It's not the headphones at fault it's just the included cable it's not too good of a quality. I tried charging the tranciever with some more premium cable and used it the disruption or rather noises stopped. So if you want to use wireless headphones with it while charging use other cables.On to the customer service it is really good. try contacting the company first rather than Amazon. Since Amazon goes for the customer satisfaction first in form of returning the item. While contacting the company itself they try to solve it since the problem might be a big deal at all. 5 star for them! They are responsive quick and really try to help you out with the problem! Contact them first it might go faster than you think!Other than that great device fulfill the needs and does what it needs to do the prize is reasonable and the device itself is easier than having a receiver AND transmitter! 4 stars because of the cable included.
4,This is a neat little tool. In this day and age devices that require a bluetooth transmitter are getting few and far between but they still come in handy.I bought this with the hopes that I could use it in my car. . Apparently my car is too old and did not come equipped with the jack to put this in lol.. But I still found other uses for it. You can plug this in your t.v. and transmit Pandora while you are cleaning. . That part has been useful. The speakers on my t.v. are MUCH better than my phone.It's really a simple tool to use. One button and one switch. And the directions are simple and easy to follow. They even give you pictures :DThe quality of the sound is excellent! I was actually expecting it to be choppy and/or full of static. But I was pleasantly surprised at how clear it is.The only thing I wish it had was a little clip of some sort to clip on your shirt if you plug some headphones into it so you don't have to plug the headphones into your phone. . Other than that the design is nice it's really light and slim and the cords are just the right size so it will be easy to plug in somewhere and not be dangling low. . in my case it keeps it out of reach of the toddler.Nice little piece of techy equipment. I've included pictures of the actual device and all the parts. . Super small and compact.I received this product at a promotional discounted rate for my honest review whether it be good or bad. I am in now way associated with the seller or manufacturer and was not compensated for this review. I have tested this product on my own and gave my honest opinion.
5,Short Summary:  This works perfect for doing an audio sync from my Projector (Optoma) using two TRONDs synced together.Long summary:I was apprehensive about the AptX LL (Low Latency) since the device states 40ms which I'd assume is per device.....so stacking two devices could potentially be upto 80ms....and I wasn't sure where the latency might reveal itself.  I've also heard of people getting headaches from watching video with audio latency and wanted to avoid that as well.I pulled them out of the box - synced them to each other using the instructions that explain syncing to a bluetooth device like headphones.  (switching one to Tx prior to the sync)....after the lights went blue (after about 3-5 seconds of blue flashing lights indicating that it was attempting to sync) I walked outside plugged the Tx into the projector plugged the Rx into my stereo (about 25 feet apart) and started Spectre 007.I didn't realize how long I had to wait until "dialog" actually occurred where I could begin assessment....I mean it's not like 007 is a Michael Bay film.  All the action shots and explosions were in-sync but there is wiggle room.  Finally upon voice dialog I could not discern any lag at all.  For reference I've played bass for many years (to Prog rock) and I'm rather keen on "timing" (well at least knowing when I'm screwing up the timing haha).  I also had my daughter evaluate who is an excellent artist and has very good perception.  While our assessment cannot give the scrutiny a hardware analysis would provide we could not discern any latency at all.One minor tidbit.  I bought the Volume control version of the TROND but didn't realize that when in Tx mode the volume buttons don't function (as stated in the documentation that I didn't read until later).  So my idea of being able to use the TROND to lower the volume from the transmit side (where I'm sitting near-ish the projector won't work.  I might be able to control that from the Optoma projector....or I'll end up getting an audio system with remote audio control.....(as I'm sure you are all worried about it!)For an outdoor patio Movie Theater I think this works wonderfully.  I will also experiment now with syncing my phone with the device for day-time audio on the patio system which will be handy for controlling audio volume and music from my phone allowing me to sit by the fire and not get up and walk the 25 ft. to the audio system to change "the channel" (I'm not living in the 70's!).  My wife might use the other device in the car since our phones have outpaced our cars on Bluetooth versions.
4,Small compact unit comes with all necessary leads to connect audio device and make it either receive or transmit to another BlueTooth (BT) device. I am using it to take audio from my TV to 2 x pairs of BT headsets (Vava Moov 28 & Kinivo BTH240)  I had to reset the device to get 2nd headset to simultaneously connect after reconnecting 1st headset - this may have been me  messing up the pairings. (so take your time and read pairing instructions for both devices to pair).The unit has a re-chargeable battery but I have mine permanently powered from a USB port on the TV and have no interference as some others have reported while charging.  The range is not huge (BT is low powered) and audio breaks up should I go to another room (this could equally be the headset)  but is not problem in the same room. There is a slight latency delay in the audio but barely noticeable when watching TV  and not a problem for audio only feeds. Good product at reasonable price.
5,I was looking for a high quality bluetooth transmitter for my modded iPod Classic 5.5G.  The TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth V4.1 Transmitter is amazing in sound quality realtime playback and ease of use.  Initially I was not expecting much due to the low price but it woks perfectly.  I think they were able to maintain the low cost by keeping it simple.  One toggle to go between transmitter and receiver one to turn on volume....  I have read some negative reviews and I can say that these reviews are due to lack of contacting support or understanding of how to operate the device.  I asked a question at one point and they kept reaching out until they knew 100% I was good.  If you have an issue I highly recommend reaching out to their support.The one thing I can see how people could get hung up by is if the device its connecting to is reset.  I had to do a hard reset on my headphones and the Trond device wouldn't auto connect as it always had done when both are powered on.  I had to switch it to the opposite mode while off (transmitter vs receiver) and then power it on.  This wipes out the old bluetooth device it "remembered" and then when its put back into the mode you want to use it in (transmitter vs receiver) it will re-pair with the reset device and it will work flawlessly.Another issue people seem as described online is latency.  This ONLY happens if your speakers (receiver) can't handle the aptX Low Latency codec.  The Trond sends a nearly realtime audio signal which is one of the reasons I love it and will get more of them.  The Inability of a person's (old/cheap?)  bluetooth speakers to receive high quality low latency audio is not the fault of Trond device.  In these situations GET 2 OF THESE as they can act as either a transmitter or a receiver.  Also they are cheap in price (not in quality) so its a no brainer.
5,I acquired a TROND model BT-DUD wireless transmitter and receiver to use as a transmitter between an older model Sony stereo amplifier (via the headphone jack) to a Sony model HT-CT770 sound bar by using its blue tooth receiver. The Sony Sound Bar guide indicated that blue tooth pairing would occur simply by starting pair functions on both the sound bar and the transmitting device. What it did not mention is that if the blue tooth function was not turned on pairing would not occurred and the sound bar would continue to indicate that blue tooth was off after the pairing attempt was complete. After checking several different sources on the internet for a more complete Sony users manual and other sources of assistance to resolve may problem I contacted Sony Support via email. That was a waist of effort the response was short and advised that the sound bar would not pair with the TROND receiver. I knew that! I then emailed TROND for assistance and although they tried to assist me they could not because the problem was with the receiving of the signal by the sound bar. When I advised TROND support that I still could not complete at pairing my support contact advised me to keep the transmitter receiver and just process a refund of the purchase price through Amazon. However before I did that and have a never say die attitude I made one more attempt to solve the problem. Played with the Sony handheld controller trying various buttons. Upon pressing the button labeled "Amp Menu" I was able to get the sound bar to display a function labeled "set bt" I choose that function and was able to turn on the Sony blue tooth. Pairing was immediate and sound quality is  great. Needless to say a refund was not requested. If only Sony's support personal had been inclined to think about my questions as TROND support personal did it would have saved me much time and effort.I highly recommend TROND as to product and for it support to its customers.
2,At first I was very excited.  The unit was small has only one button and one switch and paired right up with all three of my headphones without difficulty.  Then the disappointment started.  I rely on low latency for use with my ham radio and have three low latency headphone sets that I use.  I noticed that the transmitter was not connecting to my headphones in LL mode but rather the very slow SBC mode only.  I assumed at first it must have been a problem with my headphones so I tried every combination of button pushes both on the headphones and the transmitter turning the headphone on first turning the transmitter on first.  Turning the transmitter on and resetting the pairing turning the headphones off and then on again while leaving the transmitter on forced system resets on both the headphones and the transmitter.  You name it EVERYTHING.  I read the manual at least 10 times over.  Eventually I just gave up and assumed it was an incompatibility with the particular brand of headphones I was using (Avantree).  But then I tried the other two aptx-low latency sets of headphones I have and they had the same problem one brand Trond ad the other brand Miccus.  They would NOT connect in low latency mode.  They all connected fine in SBC mode but not in LL.  On the Avantrees I was able to get it to connect a couple times out of hundreds of tries over a period of hours in low latency mode as confirmed by the LEDs on the headphones and the performance with my ham radios.  But then I would retry the exact same sequence of button pushes and it would not connect again in low latency mode.After failing to connect to any of my three sets of LL headphones in actual LL mode I finally gave up and am returning the unit.  I'm very frustrated because otherwise this transmitter would have been perfect.  Obviously it needs some more work and better programming of its codec handshaking process.  Hopefully they will get this issue resolved and I will gladly buy it again
2,I don’t know if the problem here is me or the device. I’m following all the right steps.* Plug dongle into PS4* Make sure it is set to TX* Activate pairing mode* Power on bluetooth headset (earbuds in my case)* Put it(/them) into pairing mode* The devices will connect automatically I know I am connected to the device because when I turn it off I get the “disconnected” chirp from my earbuds.And yet I am getting no audio to my earbuds whatsoever. Audio is simply not passing through the dongle. At all. And there’s no setting on the PS4 to get the system to recognize the dongle as a transmitter. So the dongle is plugged into the second player USB port my headphones are connected to the dongle and ... the audio is still coming out of my television.I truly don’t know if I’m somehow missing something or these simply don’t work. I just wanted to offer a “buyer beware” because it seems I certainly wasted my money on these.The only reason it’s not a 1 star rating is that I DID get the dongle to work with a pair of WIRED headphones. I was able to plug my headphones into the dongle connect my phone with the dongle and I was off to the races. Worked great and sounded great.That’s a big part of why I’m so disappointed. The device worked flawlessly when I was using it as a receiver. As a transmitter it has been sadly worthless.I wish I could get my money back. More than that I wish it would just work!
3,I bought this on prime day. I wanted to test the features prior to buying one for my mother. I hooked it up to my tv and paired it with a bos e micro speaker. It was very easy to pair. However I could not adjust the volume. I specifically wanted to enhance audio for hard to hear tv across the room. Sowhile it worked it is not suitable for wireless speaker to enhance tv audio.
4,This works well.  I paired it with some USB speakers and a battery pack and it works well as a bluetooth speaker setup.  The only downside of this is that the range isn't that good - but for something so small I think it is good.  Battery life is good too.  I could easily get 3-4 hours out of it before thinking about charging it - but often if you can find someplace to plug in the audio you can plug in the power as well (at least in the receiver mode).  I was able to test out the transmit function as well but the range was a bit limiting for my particular application.  In any case it is very good for what it is.  If you have an application suited for this - in a car for example - I would recommend it.
4,I have this tucked into the center console/armrest of the car and use it on a daily basis.  The only gripe is needing to turn on the receiver each time for it on connect to my phone.  Wish there were a way to leave it on and automatically connect but it is a minor issue.
4,We purchased the TROND BT-DUO with a 7pin DIN cable to connect a Rushmore Harley Davidson to an UClear AMP Pro Motorcycle headset.  HD does not allow it's Bluetooth system to pair to anything other than a phone. Therefore to access the BOOM music system via the headset a Bluetooth transmitter was required.  The combination works as desired.  With the UClear AMP Pro's on firmware 2.04 the quirks we first saw were resolved. Music continues to play while intercom connection is made to other riders.  The joysticks on the grips work to control volume fast forward skip etc.
4,Bought one of these half a year ago still the best adapter. Perfect size and shape and actually prefer it to the new model.I only take a single star off because the image for the product is misleading. You do not receive a cable that short with the product rather a longer cable. This is fine for tvs not so great when hooking up to an mp3 player.
4,I bought this to use on my 80+ year old parent s TV so they could hear their shows better.  It was easy to connect and the BOSe speaker connected to it easily.  The hardest part was being able to plug the TROND into the back of a wall mounted TX.
3,Helpful and good little bluetooth adapter
3,Purchased this product with the intention of wirelessly connecting my bose quietcomfort 35 to my TV.  Unfortunately I should have read more reviews as it appears Im not the only one to encounter similar issues. The advertised "low latency" wasn't quite low enough and there is a noticeable lag between the audio/image. If you plan to use this item in a similar fashion I implore you to consider otherwise. However if you only need to transmit audio this item is a perfect!  Sound quality battery life ease of use & product design all exceeded my expectations
4,The Trond BT-DUO is the perfect add-on to my Bose wireless headphones and allows me to use airline on-board entertainment without the hassles of wires.  When I erroneously deleted my paired devices (iPhone laptop Trond etc.) and was unable to re-pair them a simple email to Trond customer service provided immediate clear and concise directions for a Trond reset after which I was able to pair the device again.  Trond needs to include these reset directions in their user manual.
5,For some reason these devices are a bit difficult to pair but once paired they work great. I bought the matching Bluetooth 4.2 headphones as well. Some say that they have threshold problems with audio on the Nintendo Switch - These have the lowest by far but it is still there. Unfortunately for gaming purposes there should be no noise cancelling cutoff. I have returned much more expensive devices in favor of this one. Their attention to their customers is quite impressive so expect fixes at some point!I find if I turn on the headphones first I may have to reboot the transmitter one time. That's about the best I get.Update: Still going strong a month later. I have about 600 hours into Breath of the Wild. I am using the TROND 4.2 headphones which by the way fold flat so they can be stored easily in the case I carry the Switch in. I have now found the best way to pair with the 4.2's every time - turn the HEADPHONES on first wait until the light starts flashing red and blue. Turn on the transmitter it will flash red once and connect every single time. I have other Bluetooth devices around so it is better to do it this way no interruption. I found my TV was jumping in on the transmitter (Sony Bravia). I am using the solid 3.5mm connector that came with it don't mind the "flag" look. I really like how the TROND people monitor their reviews and offer advice. Great company.
5,I bought this Trond Bluetooth adapter to listen to my music without all the wires in my way.  I use it mostly in my car and for my computer speakers.  It says it lasts eight hours off a charge but since I have been super busy I haven’t been able to listen to music that much; it’s been days since I’ve charged it so it holds battery well.The little switch at the bottom makes it easy to use in receiving or transmitting mode but it has to be off when switching modes.  To turn it on press the button for like three seconds until it starts to flash blue.  In receiving mode simply pair up the device (e.g. phone) the music is coming from to this adapter.  In transmit mode first have the device (e.g. speakers) ready to pair turn on the adapter to pair it up and plug it in.It was shipped on time and in a neat little box.  It comes with the Trond Bluetooth adapter micro usb for charging (no wall adapter is included but you probably have thousands of them laying around your house) RCA cables if you have older speakers or want to plug into your TV and a 3.55mm aux cable.As with all wireless things for audio it will never be the same quality compared to being directly plugged in.  But if you want to upgrade to this century the Trond Bluetooth Adapter is an easy way to do that become hands free!  This is the first kind of product that I bought so I don’t have any comparisons but I highly recommend this product!
4,While it took a little to get it set up after some help from customer service it's working great now.  As long as you follow the pairing steps in order it works!
5,I use this as an audio "cable" to connect things I don't have cables for: old Radio Shack amps iPhones without din jacks airplane seats hotel room av equipment etc. Works wonderfully sounds great always works (as long as you can charge the battery or plug in a USB charging cable). Simple to use red light means on blue light means pairing. Can receive or transmit uses a simple din connection. This is how all electronics should be.
4,Took a while to figure out how to pair to my new Bose QC35.  Support helped with some answers.  Finally learned that the Bose unit had memorized the pairing to my cellphone. Had to clear the pairing to my cellphone in the Bose headset.  After that the TROND unit quickly paired to the Bose headset.  Also had to keep the TROND and the Bose headset close together and give  it enough time to recognize.  After all that it works great.
5,We are living across the street from a major construction project with several pile drivers and several backhoe rock-breaker jack hammers running up to 15 hours per day 6 days per week. We not only could not comfortably watch TV we also had headaches and ringing in our ears. We have been using this bluetooth transmitter in order to listen to our Sony 48R472B TV with our Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones. We are able to pair 2 sets of headphones and enjoy watching a movie in peace. Every once in awhile we have problems pairing one or more of our devices. Usually we either just need to push the button one time on the transmitter and then reconnect or recharge one or more of our devices. After using the product for a few weeks it suddenly stopped working mid-use. We were not able to turn it off. It was just stuck with a steady blue light on. I emailed customer service at support@etrond.com and I received a reply within 6 hours. The representative suggested disconnecting the unit from the power source waiting for the battery to drain and trying to reconnect before pursuing the problem any further. We did this and by the next morning the light had gone out. We recharged the product and it is now working great again. IN SHORT THIS DEVICE HAS BEEN A LITTLE FINICKY BUT IT HAS SAVED OUR SANITY! In fact it allows us the luxuries of adjusting the volume level each to our own personal tastes as well as being able to walk about the house and still be able to hear the TV perfectly.
4,Yes I have enjoyed this Bluetooth Trond to connect my headphones to my TV works great. Had a problem about 4 months after I bought. Emailed the customer service and with in 2 email returns they had me reset back to factor and all good now. Great customer service.
4,works great
5,I bought this product to use with my TV. I took it out of the box charged it and connected to my $14.99 headset from Fry's. It paired with the TV within less than a minute after powering it up. The sound quality is very good and I'm sure there is an audio delay but it isn't noticeable at all. I've used it over a year and have had no problems with it. I highly recommend this unit to anyone looking for a Bluetooth Transmitter/Receiver. I recently purchased a TROND v4.2 Receiver for another TV. Initially I had a problem with it pairing with my TV and the Customer Service Representative for the TV said the TROND unit was probably not compatible. With the help of the TROND Tech Support representative Bruce I  was able to get the TV to pair with it. It wasn't the TROND unit that was the problem it was the manufacturer of the TV that didn't provide the necessary  instructions for pairing with the Bluetooth unit. Two things that impress me with TROND is that they have great units and excellent customer service which is hard to find nowadays. If I need other Bluetooth  Transmitter/Receiver units I will definitely buy a TROND unit.
1,I really have no idea if this thing actually works or not.  I got it for Christmas 1 day before going on a 9 hour flight and was excited to be able to use my AirPods  on the plane.  Well after about 15 minutes I finally got the light to stop flashing after powering off multiple times and retrying.  Problem is I never heard a single thing get transmitted (and yes I had it in the right mode).  Either this thingy doesn’t work at all with AirPods or it mutes the volume so badly I couldn’t here anything. Bottom line instead of watching movies on the plane with my personal headset I had to use the crappy ones they provide on the plane.  I am very disappointed with this product and do not recommend.
3,I just bought two of these.  Hoping to link up four devices.  They work with one unit transmitting to two as advertised.  They work with one unit receiving from two as advertised.  But both can not simultaneously transmit to two audio outputs while receiving from two sources.  Sending them back.  Plus neither unit transmits much past 35 ft line of site indoors.
5,I had purchased this model of the TROND wireless receiver/transmitter and it did not work with my TV.  I contacted TROND and they explained that I had purchased the wrong unit.  Once I received the right one they helped me navigate getting it set up.  And I am very happy to report that it works beautifully.  I wanted to be able to watch TV without disturbing anyone in the house. With this unit I can do just that. It paired very easily with my Samsung wireless headphones and connected to the optical digital output port on my TV. Once I had that all set up properly and changed a couple of settings on the TV I was able to have excellent audio through the headphones while turning the TV volume down to 0. I can certainly recommend this unit for anyone who wants to be able to watch TV without disturbing your loved ones. And if you do have a problem setting it up the email response time from TROND was very quick and the help easy to understand.  So make sure you get the right unit!
1,Worked fine for two months then stopped transmitting entirely. Can't connect any device anymore.
4,Bought this to listen to the TV through my hearing aid bluetooth adapter. It paired right up but was overdriven by the television output. Bought an in-line volume control and that works perfectly.
5,Received this as a gift from family member along with some Coulax Bluetooth headphones as I had mentioned I was trying to find a way to watch movies together without disturbing others and found sharing earphones cumbersome. Does exactly what I wanted and is nice and portable as well.Recently had a hiccup where the device got confused when pairing and I couldn't find solution online but their customer service was very helpful and soon got me back up and running.I haven't tried the Rx mode so I can't really comment on it.Pros: - small - decent battery life (lasts longer than my headphones 2+ hours) - easy to set up as long as you read the instructions carefully (there's also YouTube clips if you are struggling) - helpful customer service - audio sync seems to work perfectly for me.Cons: - documentation is a bit sparse - need to follow process exactly as described (I have tried turning on the trond before the earphones and it won't recognise them).Btw in case others have the issue I did. To wipe the memory of the Bluetooth pairing: turn off switch to Rx mode power up and then turn off again. When you switch back to Tx you can start the pairing process againOverall - an excellent product and would recommend.
1,Sound quality is awful (after multiple device trials);  barley audible (even at highest volume setting); no volume control;  controls not suer friendly;  audio transmits with a buzzing crackling noise.  Not recommended - not even your kids.  Really disappointed - was hoping for a product that would solve my BT issue - this was not it.
5,I have this paired up with a pocket mixer where I can combine the audio from several devices and send it via bluetooth to my headphones. I tested the range and was able to get a solid connection up to 25 feet away. Around 50 feet it started to stutter and cut out.Latency is pretty low but still noticeable when watching videos. I wouldn't recommend it for gaming but that's pretty universal for wireless audio in general. If you're curious I used to listen wired with the mixer so the latency is definitely caused by the bluetooth connection and not the mixer.
5,I was worried that the Transmitter part of this might not work well or might have issues pairing due to the inability to choose what device you want to connect it to. But  it just seems to WORK every time. I've been using it with my TV mostly at a very distance away but even when walking into another room 20 feet away separated by a bathroom it still worked fine.
1,Product was defective right out of the box. No audio when used as a transmitter or receiver just a static pulsing noise. The devise heated up and within 15 minutes the red light began to flash red then shut off by itself.  Would not turn back on due to a dead battery. I contacted Trond customer service apparently they only warranty products sold thru Amazon and not eBay according to Bruce at Trond customer service. Lousy customer service.
2,BLUETOOTH LOW LATENCY IS A MYTH.PAIRING THIS DEVICE WITH ANOTHER IDENTICAL UNIT OR ANY OTHER BLUETOOTH DEVICE WILL NOT ELIMINATE LATENCY.THIS IS TRUE OF ALL DEVICES CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET AND ALL VERSIONS OF BT INCLUDING 4.1.  4.1 IS THE BEST AVAILABLE.HOWEVER YOU WILL STILL GET A NOTICEABLE AND PERCEIVABLE LAG IN THE AUDIO.  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.I HAVE TESTED OVER 100 DIFFERENT BRANDS.  THIS IS A TOP PERFORMER BUT IT IS NOT WHAT IT PORTRAITS ITSELF TO BE.IT IS A VERY GOOD BLUETOOTH DEVICE - PERIOD. STILL NOTICEABLE LATENCY.
5,Great little device slightly larger than a matchbook. Works great but when battery drained it send out a loud high-pitched tone. So don’t forget to turn it off like I did the first time! 😉
5,I ordered the Trond transmitter because I wanted a way to finally listen to music I wanted to hear in my car. It used to have XM but cancelled and the radio stations drive me nuts. The device comes with clear instructions that were easy to follow. It doesn't take long to set up at all. I can now listen to pandora in my car from my phone with no issues. My husband also has synced his bluetooth headphones to his MP3 player that doesn't have bluetooth by using this. I like that the device is small and easy to carry along anywhere. The battery life has also not been a problem. It lasts quite a while and charges quickly as well. We have noticed that you have to resync the device to whatever you are using it with each time but it is so easy to do that it is not worth calling it a hassle.I received the Trond wireless bluetooth transmitter at a promotional rate for evaluation and honest feedback. My review is based on my personal experiences using the device at home and in my car.
5,This bluetooth transmitter/receiver is exactly what I’ve been looking for.  I need something small and compact to bring my aging but high quality stereo system into the 21st century.  The Trond fit the bill perfectly.It’s extremely small (see my photo) and comes with all the necessary cables for me to upgrade my old system.  The red and white audio cables were perfect for my situation as my old stereo didn’t have a headphone in jack.Within minutes of opening the box I was jamming out to some of my favorite songs while keeping my iPhone in my pocket!  The sound quality was much higher from this device compared to other bluetooth devices I have heard previously.  Highly recommend!The Trond comes with an 18 month warranty and a 30 day 100% satisfaction guarantee too which is always comforting.I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  And honesty  I love it!
5,The Trond BT-Duo Audio Transceiver is a Great Product. It supports the latest Bluetooth and has aptX & aptX Low latency which allows you to enjoy CD-quality sound wirelessly over the Bluetooth connection over tv's phones or tablets and watch video while listening to audio in at same time without audio delay. The product allows you to transmit wirelessly from a Bluetooth device to a non-Bluetooth device as in speakers surround sound and computer. The product also allows you to transmit wirelessly from a non-Bluetooth device to other Bluetooth devices such as headphones speakers and tablets. The Bluetooth receiver can be used in the car and allows you to transmit audio wirelessly from your portable devices. The product supports Dual Stream & Multipoint which allows it to be paired with two Bluetooth headphones or speakers and streams audio to them simultaneously. The product is very useful and comes in handy by allowing portable Bluetooth technology. Would recommend the product to anyone. A++++."I received a discount on this product in exchange for an unbiased and honest review".
1,This product is misrepresented in that it will not take a standard optical inputmy soundbar works on the output of my tv but Trond claims this is not good enough plus you can not talk to a rep there is only email communication and they will not honor their warranty
1,StarRateChanged to match edited review Written Jun 17 2019: I had not used it for a couple of months it only shows red led while connected to a charge. NO actual charging NO BT operation in any circumstances.My OLD Review: Great range in RX mode (receive): I haven't put it thru every possible test of every feature. Using as a better RCVR (in RX mode) with a MEE XMTR. TROND has proven best at reception around open doors (out of line of sight). Holds the MEE signal longer reconnects quicker than others I use. Even outside.THAT WAS THEN; THIS IS NOW 2019/07 AND IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. I WON'T BUY FROM TROND AGAIN
5,I been looking around for a inexpensive 2 in 1 bluetooth receiver and transmitter for my projector till I finally came across this on amazon by a company called TROND. And just yesterday I had tried it out with several of my devices including my projector and I couldn't be any happier. It paired real quick and worked like a charm. I've always thought it was about how good customer reviews or comments were or if the item was expensive that it was money well spent and well worth it. But I was wrong and realized it definitely not about how many good reviews or comments left by customers about the product but giving other products with less reviews and companies like TROND a chance and finding out for myself how the item was for myself.
5,I love this device. It has a just-right unassuming design easy to use fits well packed. Its receive/transmit switch is just what I was looking for! In transmit (TX) mode it helps me with my bluetooth headset in an airplane. I don't have to wield the cable for them I just plug this device into an entertainment system in the seat in front and turn on my headset. Bingo! In receive (RX) mode it can be plugged into any active speaker or a stereo to beam music to it via bluetooth. Included cables help facilitate all that very very nice!
2,It is annoying to pair and now wont pair with new headphones.  There is also a delay sometimes.
5,I absolutely love this little thing!!! I have a really long studio apartment and to hear my television at night I have to play it really loud which obviously interrupts my neighbors sleep. I attach this thing to my television and connected via Bluetooth to my little portable Bluetooth speaker and Walla problem solved! I can pair it with my little speaker and with my wireless headphones.  In truth I haven't taken the thing out the house but I am super excited about the possibilities.
5,Tricky at first but I got the hang of it. Great product.
5,This unit is being used with a Gold Monster 1000 metal detector to find gold in AZ. Latency would be a major issue but there is none. My husband is very happy with this Bluetooth unit!
5,This is a great little device that does exactly what it says on the description. I had some initial problems setting it up on my tv but an email to the quick responding customer service team took care of that and now all is working well.
5,My switch dock stays on it's side of the room where I want it.  Not a bad clutter killer keeps things quiet when I want it that way. No interference from docking even on the third party dock I use.
5,Works as expected. Purchased as a gift to allow my dad to use his non Bluetooth stereo system with his Bluetooth devices. He can now plqy his phone or iPad in his stereo system while sitting on the patio. No issues.
5,Been enjoying my Trond 2-1 bluetooth transmitter until I started having issues pairing it to my wireless speaker.  Contacted the customer support for Trond via email and they provided tips to get my device connecting again in no time.  The only critique is that the support email is fairly hard to find within the amazon subsite.  I needed to go through all the comments to find it (support@etrond.com)
5,I bought the 2in1 tx/rx and the TROND Bluetooth V4.2 Receiver Wireless 3.5mm Aux Adapter. Together I can attach the transmitter to my TV and the receiver to my wired headphones for late night watching.  The transmitter also easily paired with my bluetooth speaker if I want to listen that route.  The company was very quick and responsive to offer help (I didn't need any) and the price was right.  Very satisfied/excellent product!!!
5,My older 4Runner factory radio bluetooth only supported phone call audio.  When using aux cable from my phone often picked up a hum/noise in audio when charging phone and playing music. Using this bluetooth TX plugged into the Aux port solved the noise issue and eliminated connecting an extra cable to my phone.
5,Bought the transmitter to connect a non Bluetooth TV to a JBL Flip 4 speaker.  Plugged the device into the headphone jack on the TV followed the clear directions and had the device paired with the speaker in less than 2 minutes.  Any latency isn't noticeable.  Very pleased with the product.
5,Had an issue with the original Trond BT-DUO Tx as it had poor sound (low volume) in the left earphone of my headset.  The Trond representative was very helpful and sent out a replacement Tx which resolved the problem.  Excellent product support!
5,This is a very handy item to have. I first bought it to hookup my blue tooth head phones. Then I put it into my Ipod so I can listen to music through wireless  head phones. This thing is small enough so it is not in the way when hooked into the audio port on the IPOD. I can carry them both in a belt pouch or pocket. I have been looking for something like this to do away with the wired head phones and this is perfect. Going to buy another one so I can now again use it on my TV
5,So far so good! Love this tiny little thing. The only thing that keeps it from being absatively perfect is that when it was behind my TV the range is decreased a tad. So I just taped it to the side of the TV and it works great. On that note a recommendation: Ship it with a little piece of double-sided foam tape so the customer has the option to mount it on the TV stereo etc. (see photo). PS: I'll probably buy another one for the garage.
5,Works perfect!! Im ordering a second one!!
5,Works very well.  Always make sure you know what version of BlueTooth connection you need.  Previously I bought (from a different company) a smilar receiver but it only handled up to BlueTooth v4.0.  Once I know that I knew what to look for.
5,Wonderful! I could now finally enjoy the magic of wireless beats! The sound quality is pretty much amazing! It's great to see the teamwork of all these old and new technology.Will update soon on its tx functions. So far so good on its receiver capabilities and i commend the Trond team for their customer support!
5,I love this product!  We have a pretty decent speaker but it is not blue tooth.  I was able to connect the speaker with this device which then makes it blue tooth.  We were able to stream music at our pool party from an Ipod. We tested the range and could move the Ipod as far as 30 feet and still transmit with no delay.  This basically makes an item blue tooth that isn't already.  I have been looking for a decent blue tooth speaker and now I don’t need to.  Our current speaker set up will work fine with this device.I was given a discount on this item in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.
5,Easy connection to ipod/ipad and small size.  Use it mostly to send music from these to an older Yamaha receiver not having Bluetooth.  Sound is good to my to my 70+ old ears.
5,I am using this product to connect my Bluetooth headphones to my TV.  It works great! No audio latency and it auto connects every time I turn them on to watch.  I could not be happier.
5,This TROND Transmitter Receiver is GREAT! I purchased it along with Bluetooth headphones. Together they work perfectly with our older television to keep the peace in our house.The transmitter was so easy to set up and sync with the headphones. There have been absolutely no problems with it at all. It just needs charging every so often to keep going. My husband can now listen to his concerts sports and action movies and I don't even know he's alive except when I hear an occasional noise coming from the den. There's no more volume war going on!  This was one of the best purchases ever.
5,Wanted to setup our TV with Bluetooth and this worked perfectly.  Nice and small totally hidden so no extra wires.  For us it worked great and setup was quite simple!
1,Horrible it only works to hear.  But not to speak.
5,Works great. Once it was hooked up and paired I've never had to think about it. Sound quality is great. Distance has never been an issue.
5,This works as described I use it on TV sets and home stereo systems. Also works great in my car. Connects to my Bluetooth headphones sounds great no problems with connectivity.
5,I've been using this with my classic Ipod that doesn't have bluetooth capabilities and have paired it with my Bluetooth headphones.  It works great and pairs easily. Great product
5,This TROND 2 in 1 wireless wow! You dream it it'll do it. Turn any device into a Bluetooth device. It's great when my husband watches his shows at night and I need silence! He just pops in his ear buds that connect to the TROND / TV and boom silence! Comes with everything needed to connect to virtually everything. RCA to headphone jacks headphone to headphone jacks. Not a lot but the sky is the limit! Very little is needed to do virtually everything imaginable. This is what I loved the most haha- highly recommend! Super neat! All the guys sure love this wireless transmitter TROND! I'm thinking GREAT GIFTS! :)
5,Low Latency and ease of setup are terrific.  highly recommend!
5,Works great.
5,Easy to use. Easy to contact customer service for assistance. Good job!
5,Used this in my car.. works awesome!
5,Works like a charm.  AS they stated not suitable for live music monitoring but great around the house and sends records to bluetooth speakers.  quick customer support that helped.
5,Wow better than I expected. I was looking to keep wearing my bose in-ear noise cancelling headphones while I run and use my Apple Watch via bluetooth instead of my huge iPhone 6s+. Basically I plugged my head phones in paired the Apple Watch with the Trond 2 in 1 and lightened my lead quite a bit. Very small. Smaller than I expected and no issues!
5,Excellent device! It allows me to use my Bluetooth headset with my XM radio while driving. This is important because as a commercial truck driver I can listen to my XM radio without waking up my co-driver. And no headphone wires to get Tangled-up with the steering wheel
5,Works great. Easily makes our older TV able to connect to Bluetooth headphones. Exactly what we needed. Very small and easy to set up.
5,Good sound easy to configure and compatible with all my devices
5,I use it to transmit the sound to wireless headphones . I have a hearing problem but hear  the TV perfectly with it. After months of use it failed to pair and I could not get it to work. I sent an email to TROND support about 1 AM and had a reply by 7AM on how to fix the problem.  Can't ask for better service than that!
5,It is great that they send a E-mail with instructions that you can see and read with. So far everything works just fine. My wife can wear Blue tooth hearphones anywhere around the house. if you cannot hookup just follow the instructions switching from transmitter to receiver and back to transmitter resetting the connection.  It only happened once and it was my fault.
5,I connected to headphones and watched YOUTUBE. I did not feel the delay of the sound much. I am satisfied with this product.
5,Easy to use. Reasonably priced. Highly recommended.
5,Worked perfectly. Easy to setup.
5,Has been reliable for over a year now. I can use wireless headphones to watch TV or listen to music without disturbing my Apartment neighbors. Very pleased!
5,This product is perfect. It was purchased as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves the reliability and quality of the item (this is actually his second...he uses one at home and one in his vehicle).  Also the seller was great about providing information on how to use the product.  Great product and great seller!
5,I gave this as a gift and the person I gave it to says it's great. So everyone's happy. My friend says it works wonderfully. Plus these guys have your back in case the rarity occurs and your faults out.
5,Works perfectly to give my switch Bluetooth capabilities for headphones. Wonderful product.
5,I have ordered 4 of these for a school. Here is how we use them. We have projectors mounted from our ceilings. We then connect the wireless transmitter to the aux port on our projectors. The transmitters then connect via blutooth to a soundbar. It is a simple sound setup. They work flawlessly in our setup.
5,Technical service assistance was beyond expectation!
5,Easy to pair worked as expected.
1,Mine worked 4 times then quit. I got it about 6 weeks ago to take on vacation in the camper to use with the tv. We were on the road for 4 weeks and it quit the first week. Unfortunately I don't remember who I ordered it from so no returns I guess.
5,Easy and logical to setup.
5,Works Great!
5,I first realized I needed something like this when I was on a plane and wanted to watch the in flight entertainment but only had Bluetooth headphones with me. I was looking for something that could both transmit to headphones and receive to speakers from a phone and this little device is pure magic. Works fantastically to connect to aux speakers and has great Bluetooth range. I’ve also transmitted from the seat back on a plane and worked perfectly to my headphones. I’m so happy with this and how well it continues to work after 7 months of use.
5,Works great. Connects fast and doesnt drop connection like other adapters I have used. The size is perfect and has excellent sound quality. Used primarily in my vehicle to connect my phone for music streaming. Unable to connect for calls unless I change the mode manually. It wont receive and transmit simultaneously.
5,Very good upgrade from my old blue tooth transmitter. I use it on a non blue tooth TV to connect to a blue tooth sound bar I love that it can be left on in TX and when the sound bar is turned on it connects automatically. Old one didn't. A pain. Had some trouble with connectivity but I think I had interference from other devices.
4,I bought this transmitter to use with my old bedroom TV. I was surprised at how small it was. Liked that it came with cables I didn't have to go and buy my own. Directions were ok. Very easy to hookup.  I had to find a wireless head phones that was able to pair with the transmitter.
5,I have not tested the receiver function only the transmitter function basically that's why I bought it and I'm 100% satisfied.It has a good transmit distance and work will with 2 of my induction headset and my air pod.My only complain is that the volume is not as loud even with the mp3 player it at maximum.... all and all...love it
5,Bought a new car and this one doesn't have a line in input.  I like my mp3 player for listening to podcasts this provides a connection.  Volume could be higher but that may be a function of my rockboxed Sansa E250.  W/o something else to test with I can't point a finger either way.  It meets my needs.If I feel different about it in the future I'll edit the review.W
5,This thing is an absolute workhorse for the price. Want to wirelessly transmit your TV sound to 2 people? Got it. Want to give your Nintendo Switch Bluetooth connectivity? Got it. Want to turn any car with an aux port into a Bluetooth capable receiver? Got it.Not to mention it has a battery so you dont even have to have it connected constantly.Would give it 10 stars if I could.
5,This is a revised review based on the seller sending me a replacement unit that worked perfectly! The first unit was defective and the seller send me a replacement unit even though I received credit for returning the originally purchased unit! Excellent customer support!!!
5,This bluetooth transponder worked exactly as we needed it to with our metal detectors and wireless ear buds.  After pairing the first time connecting the ear buds with the transponder is very quick.  We got several hours of use before needing to recharge.  Great deal for the money!  Would recommend this product.
5,This adapter works great! I was very impressed with how easy it was to set up and connected to my devices. It is a perfect adapter for my car.
4,The instructions were not clear but I was able to plug this in and have my earbuds connect for the first time ever!!  I have not been on a zoom call with it but anticipate that the microphone will work adequately as well.
5,Works great with my iLuv earbuds to watch TV late at night.  I replaced a clumsy wired system. This one is easy connects quickly and works great.
2,Connected OK to my Bose QC I headphones.  Takes a very long duration press-and-hold to turn on or off around 30 seconds. That's too long.  Also more importantly voices and content fade in and out and this is not good. Will return and try a different brand.
3,Doesn’t work with an iPhone and can’t get directions online. Junk.Update: The company reached out to me and provided me with a new product and gave me an instruction manual to help. Good customer service!
5,Awesome little bluetooth device! Works amazingly well! Would definitely recommend.
5,Initially I could not work out how to get it working with my Bluetooth headset. I d e cited to ask the Trond CS for help.  They were fast extremely helpful and followed through and we got it all working. Mostly my fault for not getting it right but such nice people. Buy Trond if you want what you expect! Great Customer Service and friendly.Thanks Trond.
5,I use this to connect my backyard theater projector to my Bose Solo 5 sound bar and it works great.  Easy to pair and haven't had any issues with drops etc... It has good battery life on a charge and does everything I need it to do.
5,Easy to use.
5,works
5,Easy to pair and works well!
5,Works perfectly.  Paired up with my earbuds immediately.
4,Big things in a small package definitely a good value so far so good
5,Great product!
4,Worked well for basic televisions. Could not get to work with televisions that had Optical Digital Audio Out connection.
5,Great product
5,Not too strong with range.
5,Works great in my car that is not bluetooth ready
5,I like  how small it is and easy to set up. The sound quality is great and just a great product.
4,Works ans seems decent quality doesn't feel cheap.
3,Did work nearly as good as I anticipated.
5,I had another one i bought on amazon and it really didnt woork
4,Simple to pair
1,Not recommended. Did not last even for a year with light use.
5,I was using a cheaper older Bluetooth transmitter to watch TV through headphones.The older one works well except with one pair of new headphones had an extremely noticeable jittery sound while listening.I bought this after trying a optical out adapter that had a Bluetooth transmitter built in and it was junk.This sounds great works with no noticeable delay in voice sync and the volume control on the 3 pairs of headphones works great.Highly recommended.
5,Product received as specified items work well as expected.
5,Excellent item. Use for pairing dialysis TV to Bose QC earbuds. Comes with convenient 1.5" metal  3.5 mm to 3.5mm adaptor.
5,Works really well and easy to use. We had a different one that gave my wife issues. This one connects very quickly and is easy every time we get in the car.
5,it works great
5,Fantastic product. My mom would have the volume of the TV so high you could it next door. Hooked this unit up and once I figured out I had to use the cable box audio outputs since the TV gets it's feed from the cable box it connected ASAP.We have Xfinity so keep that in mind if you are hooking this unit up a Vizio V585x-H1 series TV go through the Xfinity cables box audio outputs and connect the transmitter USB to the open Xfinity USB slot on the cable box
5,You can use this broadcast the music or soundtrack to your Bluetooth headphones or earbuds.  It also works on laptops that may not have Bluetooth so you can use them wirelessly while watching videos.  Rechargable battery.
5,Works well with my Jabra earpieces - use it with our TV.  I had to buy a this unit - I used my last one on a TV that obviously had too high of an output voltage an fried the unit.  This unit comes with RCA to 3.5 MM jack so I won't have to rely on my luck with random TV's while I am traveling.
5,works great with my wireless headphones.
4,Good value but having some difficulty with volume in my headphones.
5,It looks bigger on the site. But it still dose the job
5,I use the Trond in transmitter mode to make my metal detector wireless. It works flawlessly!
5,No lag time in the audio. I am using this with Bluetooth headphones to do DVD courses and lag time was a concern. This is perfect.
2,This pairs easily with the Boss Soundlink Mini 2 so far.  Unfortunately it stopped.  Has to return.
5,Ordered this item so my wife and I could both listen to clear and individually adjusted volume on Bluetooth headsets while attending Zoom meetings.
5,So convenient for the lack of bluetooth in my car. I at first thought I  needed new speakers but it was just the device's I was using with my car. The sound quality is amazing!
5,I have an AB Q90 Implant with CI-Connect (Bluetooth). This transmitter works great with the CI-Connect but you have to reset the TROND's memory to get it to re-pair with the C-Connect after the CI-Connect has been paired with a Smart Phone. The procedure is in the instructions. Also be sure that you turn Bluetooth off on all smart phones and computers in the area before trying to pair this transmitter with CI-Connect. I've provided AB with detailed instrucitons on how to connect the two. The TROND does not tell you which codex it is using but that's not a big deal.
3,It connects to my earphones not unless it is direct line of sight it drops connections so I just keep it on the side of earphone that receives the signal. It’s cheap enough so no complaints
5,I loved it would recommend
5,I bought this to use on the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. I needed aptx Low Latency so the audio and video were synced together. I am using another brand aptx Low Latency receiver. It works but not how I envisioned it. I was going to use this as the transmitter and afix it to my Quest 2 headset. But I could not get the tx and rx to connect in aptx LL mode. Just as a test I configured the Trond as the receiver feeding my amp and the device I was planning to use as my rx I configured as my transmitter. Voila! The two devices connected as aptx LL. The down side is the other device is larger and about 2inches square and marginally heavier than the Trond. But still not that bad so I velcroed it to the VR headset. So it works fine. Wish both units had a little longer battery life before needing charging again. But there is no detectable latency.
5,It didn't quite do what I was hoping for but did it's job well. I was trying to use it to be able to use my wireless earbuds on my cb radio. That part worked great. The part that was unexpected was that the microphone in the earbuds picked up my voice (very loudly) and broadcast that through the earbuds as well.  After thought it made sense and is no reflection on how the transmitter worked it worked very well.
1,Stopped working for more than 2 minutes at a time wont charge
5,I got this unit as I could no longer use ear bud earphones with my hearing aids.  I now use this unit to connect my two-way radio to my hearing aids and works wonderful. The internal battery seems to only last about 8 hours but that works for me.
4,Order the Trond BTDuo to connect my hearing aids to my old TV.  Sadly I could not connect to 2.  Did connect to my tablet but only in receiving mode which didn't help..  But I would like to point out Trond's customer service. It was wonderful.  Bruce answered in a timely fashion made recommendations  did all  he could do to try to help me connect my hearing aids (yes they have bluetooth).  I commend and thank him on his great service.
5,TV Watching
4,UPDATE 10/28/2020TROND reached out to me to help me fix the buzzing/static sound problem. They sent a new unit immediately which I received today and installed on my TV. The buzzing sound was still there but it wasn't as pronounced. After I sent TROND my feedback they immediately responded. They asked me to reset the unit. After resetting the unit the buzzing sound disappeared. I can now hear my music and videos clearly!To all those who have had this problem you can reach out to TROND and they'll help out.I have updated my rating to 4 stars because due largely to their customer support. However I cannot give it a full 5 stars because this buzzing problem should be addressed by updating their hardware to include a built-in ground loop noise isolation. If you have to buy an extra hardware to make this work flawlessly then it's not worth it no matter how cheap it is.-------------------------ORIGINAL Review:I just got this today and immediately put it to the test! Everything seemed to work just fine until I plugged it in via USB. This created an annoying buzzing/static sound. This is the reason why I gave this a 1 star. Every good thing was negated by this annoying static sound while the unit is plugged in via USB.
5,Initially I had problems connecting this to my Bose Q35 headphones but a note to their customer service was quickly answered and the problem resolved. Good product.
5,This device easily connected to 2 different brand head phone so my wife and I can enjoy movies in full sounds nice reduction head phones. Sound quality is very good as good as your headphones.It repeatedly and reliably automatically connects to two pairs of headphones just by powering them on.  The latency is very minimal. If I mute the TV speakers while using the headphones it becomes completely un noticeable.I use it for TV sound. This device will handle any Bluetooth Transmit or receive function you need.  Very versatile.
4,Bought two one to transmit from my projector and one to receive at my sound bar setup in less than 5 minutes and practically takes away all lag
5,This product is awesome!!
5,Bluetooth connection needs to be connected by pressing the button on the device every time you need to connect your  headset with it.
5,Love this transmitter to pair with BT earpiece headset speaker etc.
5,First off I've noticed I get almost zero latency if I hook this directly to my CATV box or DVD player but if I hook to my TV (either headphone jack or RCA jacks latency becomes a tad more noticeable but still pretty small)That being said I had also wanted to use it to hook to an MP3 player that I foolishly decided to buy without Bluetooth and it needed to be small so I could wear it in my armband/belt case with that player and this Trond unit is tiny and it worked out really well.It is easy to operate and I can hook it to 2 headphones simultaneously although it is a little tricky at first.(HINT read the directions and follow carefully)I am very pleased with this and not only would I buy another I already ordered one more.I've not tried hooking it up to 2 speakers simultaneously but I've no doubt it will work as well.I have been going through these little Bluetooth Tx/Rx devices like crazy since last October I've returned so many I though Amazon would cut me off. This is the only unit so far that pairs with all my headphones/earphones effortlessly and checks all the boxes.I was reluctant to spend this much money compared to all the $10 - $15 out there (and I still have one of those that I purchased from Amazon for about $13 and IT is pretty darn good for the money) but this Trond has been well worth it.All the other ones would pair with some things but not others or would cut in and out or had too much latency on the TV - onandonKUDOS Trond... so far that is... if there is problems down the road I will update.BTW I have not used this as a receiver yet so I can't comment on that...And for the record I've learned with all these such devices like this or MP3 players DO NOT CHARGE THEM WITH YOUR PHONE CHARGER DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FAST CHARGERS YOU WILL BURN OUT THE BATTERY - common sense applies charge them with your computer or you TV USB - you will get a much better battery lifespan..I hope this has been of help.Update: 5.02.2022 - Had this for a year bought it for my Mom she is hard of hearing now and hates to use the closed captions and likes to be able to listen to her news shows all day. This is stil going strong after a year and at a minimum usage of 10 hours a day every day. It is always plugged into a Agptek .5mA charger and I take it off every month or so to drain the battery and recharge it. And it still takes over 8 hours of usage before I recharge it and it is still transmitting at the 8 hour mark. This is the best BT transit/receive unit you will find in this price range and probably well over it. And their customer service and outstanding and they back up their warranty. I have 3 Tronds now one for my living room TV one for the bedroom TV and one for my office computer.
5,This product did what I expected. Works fantastic
5,Great battery life. It allowed me to use my Apple AirPod pro on a long flight to watch movies. It was connected to the inflight entertainment screen and worked flawlessly. Some reviews mention lag but I didn’t notice it. I just had to move the volume almost all the way up on the screen but it still worked out and sounded great.
5,bueno
5,Transmitter works perfect for television
5,Pairing mode  trick at first but I got ahold of it...I purchased 3.Being able to pair up to 5 items is FANTASTIC!
5,Did the job perfectly.
5,After I realized that it would work better if I had it on digital instead of antenna for the tv it works great.
5,I used this device to connect a projector audio output jack to a soundbar speaker.  Works really well. Very happy.
5,This is a great product for RV'ers
5,We purchased another bluetooth transmitter and it did not work in our travel trailer but this one works well.  Highly suggest if you are wanting to do bluetooth through a non-smart TV in a TT.
5,Pairs easily. Very long battery lifd
5,Was looking for Bluetooth adapter to connect my tv and be able to listen with my headphones. This did the job. The instructions was easy to follow and only took seconds to connect. I did charges the adapter before using. Glad I didn’t listen to the bad reviews.
5,Product is very easy to set up and use.  Comes with a wide assortment of adapters.
5,Bruce at tech support was very helpful and sent me a new transmitter when we could not figure out why the other one was not working. Great connectivity to my headphones so I can watch TV.
5,I use this to Bluetooth from multiple Android to old school party sound system and works great. Flip the switch to transmit and I can go from the T.V. to head phones at night and not wake up the house. It's a little tricky to switch devices but it takes a few time and simply reading the instructions to get it done. Perfect price for what you get
5,I recently had my little vintage zenith AM radio repaired as it had been solely decorative before. I had audio jacks installed so that I could play music from my phone to the radio. This little thing is so unobtrusive my phone instantly connects when it’s on and now I can listen to my music with that classic radio sound.
1,This arrived a day early paired right away with a bluetooth headset so now the TV can be watched without disturbing anyone else. I am not a tech geek and even I got this to work.UPDATE: Stopped working just after return period closed.  Very disappointing. I have no idea why and have tried repeatedly to get this to work without success.
3,Still working with it but as of now cannot get it to transmit from my TV to my Bluetooth headphones will update if I finally have success
5,I own a Trond Bluetooth audio transmitter/receiver. I’ve had it for several years now. It’s not perfect by no means but it connects and sounds good. I purchased this TROND so I can play my phone wirelessly through my Panasonic boombox. I took the unit out of the box then charged it up. I turned it on and my phone found it immediately. I fired up my Amazon music and Presto I was streaming music. Very pleased with my purchase!
5,Worked great for my iPod so I could listen to it in my 2020 truck which has Bluetooth only.
5,Easy to install. I plugged it into my audio systems headphones using a ug adapter added a bit of self-stick velcro tape to mount it in an accessible position and voila! Bob's your uncle!
2,I bought this to use when I’m on the treadmill but whenever I use it I have to crank the tv volume up to 100 along with my headphones and it’s so staticky it’s difficult to hear anything.  Would not recommend.
5,This transmitter works great! I have no lag time from my TV to my UEBoom2 bluetooth speaker. It readily connected to my speaker but I had no sound using the AV plugs and adapter included in the box. When I switch the direct line from the transmitter into my Audio port on my TV (see pics) I got perfect sound. I control the sound volume of the bluetooth speaker with my amazon/tv remote. This was a good buy!
5,This is perfect to connect my single turntable to have the sound come thru my Alexa device! Was the perfect solution! Recommended!
5,Easy to install and connect as a Bluetooth transmitter to my Sonos Roam Bluetooth speaker.  Instructions were easy to follow. Comes with a USB cord for power so you will need to plug it into a powered USB port not 110V outlet (unless yo have a power converter).
5,My TV did not have Bluetooth and this was a simple an easy way to fix that issue. I have not noticed any latency or pairing issues.
4,I use this device to connect my Nintendo Switch/ Nord Electro to my AirPods Pro. Sometimes they have trouble connecting but when they do it works really well. There's barely a lag for those wanting to connect to an amp or instrument and works extremely well basically no lag with the nintendo switch.
5,Connection is super easy
5,We needed a way to hook up a Bluetooth speaker for my dad so he didn’t have to turn the tv up so loud. It was very simple to connect and use.
5,Battery last long and you can use it while charging
5,This is amazing tool. My wife and I watching TV with headsets and and there is no any connection problem. I liked it so much.
5,I have enjoyed using the Trond BT-DUO unit for a year or so but recently the unit stopped pairing.  I contacted Trond and they did not hesitate quickly sending a replacement unit.  They are a reputable company that stands behind their products.
5,Very compact and easy to pair with my E7 headphones in TX mode. Initially used USB port on my Onkyo amp to supply 5 volt power to the transmitter and had considerable AC hum with no audio so changed to a spare phone charger and the hum disappeared. So...be sure to use a clean 5v DC power supply when checking for hum (a 5 volt phone battery is best since it is pure DC). If it hums with a battery return it ASAP. Auto pairs to my E7s each time I turn them on if I leave the transmitter powered up.  If the transmitter is powered down be sure to press its lighted push button until the light turns to solid blue.
5,Guitarists wanting to use this to transmit from their "amp in a box" to bluetooth headphones: the latency is prohibitive (there is too much of a lag between what you play and what you hear in your headphones). And I have the latest tech Sony headphones.I took a chance on this product for that purpose thinking that if there was too much lag I would just use it to transmit from my TV to my headphones. It does work good for that purpose.
5,Compré 2 de estos adaptadores para conectar mi Oculus Quest 2 a mi teatro en casa. Use 2 porque el Bluetooth que tiene mi teatro en casa no es low latency por ende al usar 2 conseguí que el audio tuviera un nulo retraso es indistinguible de usar una conexión por cable.RECOMENDACIÓN: Tratar de mantenerlos en línea directa con el dispositivo que conecten pueden sufrir pérdidas de señal incluso cuando hay mucha gente entre ellos y el receptor
4,Nachdem ich mir zuvor einen Bluetooth Transmitter gekauft hatte mit dem sich meine Kopfhörer nicht paaren lassen wollten habe ich mir diesen bestellt.Das Pairing funktioniert ohne Probleme selbst zwei Kopfhörer lassen sich ohne weitere Probleme verbinden.Die in anderen Rezensionen erwähnte Verzögerung bei der Tonwiedergabe kann ich leider bestätigen. Da der Transmitter zum einen verhältnismäßig günstig ist und ich mir diesen zum anderen für Flugzeugreisen gekauft habe stört die leichte Verzögerung kaum. Da gibt es im Flugzeug schlimmeres.Die Akkulaufzeit ist für Langstreckenflüge ausreichend.In Rezensionen zu dem Bluetooth Transmitter kann man häufig lesen dass dieser zu leise sei. Das musste ich anfangs auch feststellen da in den Grundeinstellungen des Transmitters eine geringe Lautstärke gespeichert ist. Da meine Kopfhörer eine Bluetooth-Lautstärkenreglung zulassen z.B. fürs Handy konnte ich mit meinen Kopfhörern den Transmitter lauterstellen und war vollkommen zufrieden.Den Stern Abzug bekommt der Transmitter aufgrund verschiedener Kleinigkeiten wie z.B.:- Geringe initiale Grundlautstärke und keine Lautstärkenregelung am Gerät selbst- Kein USB-C
3,Cumple en la parte de la baja latencia pero lo quería para jugar en nintendo switch con unos audifonos alambricos que me gustan mucho y no pude emparejarlo con el transmisor que también es de baja latencia al probarlo con otros dispositivos noto ruido blanco que me parece molesto por ejemplo en partes silenciosas de las peliculas.
5,lo quería para un piano electrónico lo único es que tiene latencia y no le sirvió para lo que lo compre pero también puede ser causa de los audífonos la latencia. por eso le sigo dando 5 estrellas
5,Arrived much sooner than expected and arrived in perfect condition. Amazing device that allows me to use my Bluetooth headset on my Nintendo Switch.
5,Cumple Muy bien con lo que estaba buscando
5,Me gustó que no se pierde la señal y funciona de acuerdo a la especificación.
5,Tiene mucho alcance en el modo transmisor muy práctico
5,Great Product no lag
3,I wanted to use it to send audio from my guitar but too much latencySet up was easy and no tiger issues
4,Fonctionne correctement
4,I bought this to enable me to listen on my Bluetooth earbuds to an old Sony MP3 player and to listen to music coming from my smartphone to the AUX audio input on my analogue car radio. In both cases it seems to work well. Bluetooth sound quality is not hi fidelity but OK for listening in the car or on earbuds. The unit switches between either being a Bluetooth receiver or a transmitter which makes it flexible and gives you the ability to connect different kinds of media using Bluetooth. I have not used it long enough yet to work out battery life but so far it has been OK on a two hour car journey.
4,The sound continually faded
5,I purchased this to connect my Ipod Classic to a LG Soundbar via bluetooth so have only used the 'transmit' mode and it does it very well...almost a bit too well I didn't realise that this device can connect to 2 blue devices at the same time as my neighbour 2 floors below also with a LG Soundbar found out!
4,solala.. wenns mal funzt is alles gut nur bis es mal geht.. nervt ewig
5,Ho già un "gemello" di questo BT-DUO di un'altra marca (chi indovina?) e servendomene un altro per l'uso che vedete in foto ho deciso di provare anche questo avendo prezzi e caratteristiche simili.Anzi proprio uguali non c'è niente di male in questo sono le regole della globalizzazione che ha difetti sì ma anche tanti pregi per noi consumers.Grazie alla miniaturizzazione dell'elettronica un oggettino così piccolo può avere funzioni e prestazioni così grandi.Ero curioso di verificare se la media di 5 ☆ nelle recensioni corrispondeva alle reali qualità dell'adapter.Devo dire che si presenta ben costruito rivestito in gomma opaca con tutti gli accessori che servono senza inutili fronzoli.Si installa in un attimo perchè una volta effettuata la prima connessione conserva la memoria dell'associazione e quindi quando acceso passa subito in modalità associazione memoria persa se si cambia funzione (da RX a TX e viceversa).L'audio in effetti non ha lag rispetto al video ed anche come riproduzione musicale il suono risulta pieno.I principali usi sono connettere una cuffia non bluetooth al computer (come RX) oppure una cuffia bluetooth connessa all'impianto audio di casa (come TX): avendo destinato il "gemello diverso" all'uso con un sistema di casse 2.1 per il Galaxy Note Pro ho deciso di usare questo (vedi foto) per rendere wireless la ottima scheda audio esterna Terratec Aureon Xfire 8.0 che controlla l'audio del mio HP Envy 17 così posso usare le mie diverse cuffie BT col notebook certo sacrificando la resa paragonata all'uso di cuffie cablate ma guadagnando in comodità d'uso.Anche questo ha prestazioni notevoli come trasmissione/ricezione del segnale non risente di interferenze ed ha una buona copertura: il raggio di azione è dichiarato entro 10 m però all'esterno senza ostacoli dentro casa la copertura è minore e per mantenere un buon segnale stabile è megliorestare entro i 3/4 m di distanza.Prezzo non eccessivo per la qualità offerta.Dunque le 5 ☆ sono proprio meritate.Solo una piccola pecca: manca una regolazione del volume su entrambi gli adapter cosa che verrebbe utile usandoli come RX con cuffie classiche che appunto non hanno volume proprio.La durata media della batteria devo ancora testarla bene al primo uso sull'onda dell'entusiasmo a forza di provare diverse connessioni credo non sia durata più di 6/7 ore comunque una durata discreta.Quando la batteria è bassa e quando si spegne l'adapter emette un segnale acustico a 3 note oltre al lampeggiare/commutare del led.Dimenticavo di far notare che si possono associare due elementi in contemporanea all'adapter sia in TX (può trasmettere a 2 ricettori diversi come 2 cuffie BT con riproduzione in contemporanea) che in RX (qui si possono connettere le cuffie non BT a due sorgenti BT diverse ma con riproduzione alternata e non simultanea) un altro pregio che lo rende molto appetibile._EDIT_Dopo parecchi giorni d'uso posso confermare il giudizio positivo ed aggiungo che ho fatto una importante ed efficace modifica alla configurazione dell'adapter (vedere foto allegate).Ho infatti usato questo connettore:https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B00QT9SQW0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1per connettere l'adapter alla sorgente (smartphone cuffie pc impianti casse) sostituendo il mini cavetto originale; in questo modo il segnale è in "presa diretta" senza la seppur minima dispersione di segnale del filo.Con una spesa di ben 4 € è una modifica che consiglio a tutti (l'ho applicata anche al "concorrente" TaoTronics TT-BA07 ebbene sì svelato il mistero!) si rende il sistema più compatto e performante.Molto soddisfatto.
4,I bought one of these to replace a set of wireless headphones I used with my TV.  I did not realise at the time that for low latency you needed the same version of Bluetooth in transmitter and receiver.  Since the first unit worked well and I could not decide on a pair of low latency headphones I bought a second unit and plugged some wired headphones into it.  That worked a treat.  The Bluetooth is as easy to set up as on anything with just one button and the fact that you can use them to transmit or receive is really useful.  I only had 3.5mm connections on my TV so the lack of audio inputs for anything other than line level is not a problem for me but you might want to look for something with other inputs if you have the sources and are looking for the best audio output.  Sound quality seems good to me but I am not a hi-fi nut.  I have also not tested the battery capacity to anything like the stated time so look to other reviews for that.  I am very happy with the two units I bought.
5,This is being used in the Transmitter mode.  Connection to the Bluetooth headphones was easy and quick.  There are no latency issues when watching videos on a PC.
4,Having read mixed reviews on performance I went ahead and purchased this dongle. Ideally I'd like more volume control but sound quality is good paring was easy handy size quick recharge. Looking forward to next flight to try out.
4,Falla a la hora de vareiar el volumen. Parece que no se puede variar pero insistiendo se logra.
5,Meine Frau brachte mich auf den Gedanken dass über Kopfhörer die Tonqualität erheblich besser ist. Sie benutzte schon seit längerem einen Kopfhörer aus gesundheitlichen Gründen. So startete ich einen Versuch mit dem Transmitter der auch sehr schnell geliefert wurde. Unsere Kopfhörer sind im Preissegment von 38-  Euro bis 48- Euro angesiedelt und neueren Datums. Nachdem ich den Transmitter so angeschlossen habe wie in der Beschreibung angegeben und den kleinen Schalter von RX auf TX umgeschaltet hatte versuchten wir die Kopplung so wie in der Beschreibung. Es klappte sofort. Ich war begeistert. Beim 2. und 3. Mal klappte es dann nicht mehr. Mir war klar da gibt es einen Trick. Der Transmitter speichert wahrscheinlich die Bluetooth-Verbindung und erkennt die Kopfhörer automatisch. Nun braucht man ihn nur noch einzuschalten (Schalter ca. 4-5 Sekunden gedrückt halten) und dann den ersten Kopfhörer einschalten in in einen Abstand von ca. 10 cm zum Transmitter bringen. Dieser beginnt nun selbständig hektisch rot-blau zu blinken und kurz danach kommt die Ansage ich verbinde auf englisch. Nun legt man den Kopfhörer aus den Kopplungsbereich ca. 3-5 Meter entfernt hin und nimmt den 2. Kopfhörer und wiederholt den Prozess. Auch hier erfolgt die automatische Erkennung nach wenigen Sekunden. Sollte es mal nicht klappen den Kopfhörer abschalten 3 Sekunden warten und den Vorgang wiederholen im Bereich von 10 cm. In 4 Wochen gab es kein einziges Mal wo mehr als 2 Versuche nötig waren. Die Tonqualität ist super und es gibt auch keine Sprachverzögerung. Ich habe deshalb gleich einen 2. Transmitter gekauft da der Markt sich schnell verändert. Was heute gut ist kann es morgen schon nicht mehr geben. Also volle 5 Punkte.
5,I use this to allow my airpod pros to connect to inflight entertainment on long haul flights. It's smaller than I thought (about the size of a 50p piece) and is a must have for my hand luggage.Connection is super easy just make sure you don't have a competing device nearby that will 'steal' the connection.I purchased alongside a little case to make sure that I keep all of the bits together.You can charge and transmit at the same time so you are good for the full flight! The connection is strong enough that it holds the device in place as well.
2,I bought this to add bluetooth functionality to my passive earphones primarily for pottering about at home without being tied to my laptop. I don't like having heavy bluetooth earphones in my ears and this seemed to fit the bill. Overall I'm impressed but I wouldn't buy it again. Firstly the Pros;+Very light weight small unit perfect for carrying+Surprisingly good battery life given its size+Able to drive my passive earphones very loud+Latency is almost unnoticeable (this well be codec dependent on your pairing device)+Good assortment of cables included (charging RCA Male-Male jack Female-Female jack)+Very easy to use decent instructions+Can be charged while listening+Can pair with two devices at once both receive and transmit (I don't have a use for this but nice)My primary reason for not buying again is the audio quality. In receive mode the background noise/hiss is very high at all times. It is irrespective of the audio source volume so if you are listening at very high levels it won't be as bad but it's bad. Main cons;-High background noise-No volume control (not a big issue but would have been nice)-Music cut-out. This is clearly by design either a stipulation in the bluetooth protocol or a battery saving measure on the device. When the music source is close to silent the audio driver cuts out after a few (maybe 5) seconds. In a way it's nice because the hiss goes away the downside is that it takes a while (half a second) to come back on. Example; if connected to my PC with no audio actively playing it shuts off but I get an email notification ding. The device is too slow to catch the ding. Ironically the driver starting back up and 5 seconds of hiss is it's own notification sound.The range is perfectly reasonable neither pro or con. It works room to room not quite first floor to second floor. I have also tried it in transmit mode and that worked pretty much the same.Conclusion: I think it's a wonderful device let down by presumably some cheap ADC/filtering components. Such a shame. Note to manufacturer if the hiss is atypical let me know send me a new device and I'll happily change my review
4,The product is conveniently small and appears to work ok. Unfortunately the cables supplied are too short to be practical so had to discard them and use some of a more appropriate length
4,Make sure that the device you want to connect to is the only one turned on otherwise it may connect to another device instead. If you are using it on your TV to connect to ear buds or headphones they must be low latency or the sound will be noticeably out of synchronisation -  and it is awful. Even though your phones or buds may have been bought very recently that does not guarantee they are low latency devices. My Sony Bluetooth headphones have to go through the connection process every time I connect to this transmitter even though the literature says that once synchronised it is not necessary - not true unfortunately. That said it is a neat device simple to use and will operate with lots of devices. I can use my small dab radio without the hassle of earphones with wires. I just plug the transmitter into the headphone socket and use my Bluetooth buds or phones.
4,Dommage qu'il faille souvent réappairer.
5,Easy to set up and makes connecting a portable speaker to our projector super easy. Good value!
3,There seems to be some re-pairing issues with the device. I've successfully paired it with ease at first with my mdr xb950BT with APTX support. My headphones doesn't seem to support APTX low latency but the delay was still minimal with APTX (noticible but not too much) so I'd say it is usable. The device stays on as a transmitter so I don't have to turn the device on-off. Just stays on and supposedly it should reconnect automatically. But that is the problem. If I turn the headphones off and turn it back on it doesn't automatically re-connect. Once I was able to re-connect by double tapping the button to put the transmitter in pairing mode but that doesn't even work anymore. Will keep trying if this resolves but probably a return if it doesn't.Edit// after 12 hours the device is still on which i like. Range is also satisfactory. But the entire point of leaving it on is to have it reconnect automatically which it doesnt do with my headphones. All other bluetooth are off. This really trumps all other advantages as it makes it unusable for my parents (having to repair manually every time). Disappointing.Edit// Tried resetting the headphones to erase all pair memory then repaired only with this unit. Seems like I am getting consistent re-connects now. But that means I won't be able to use the headphones with any other devices which I guess won't be too much of a draw back. Will test and raise stars if it keeps this up for a week or so.Edit March 20//It maintained charge well plugged in and turned on 24/7. Quick to reconnect. Good enough for my usage! :)
5,I'm using this in transmit mode to listen to the TV via Bluetooth when my wife is asleep. This unit is plugged into my Onkyo audio receiver and the USB charging cable is connected to the front USB port on my satellite receiver. This set up works very well and is easy to use. Long press the power button to turn the unit on long press the power button to turn it off.The sound quality is definitely good enough for TV & movies and the audio & video stay in sync. I'm using this transmitter with the high-end Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H9 headphones that support AptX-LL which helps avoid audio sync issues.Bluetooth range is OK. If you need longer-distance coverage plan to get long audio and USB cables for maximum distance.Highly recommended!
5,This transmitter/receiver performs exactly as described. It is tiny! Sound quality is excellent; I will use it to play podcasts & music from my Windows 10 Phone & laptop on a 30-year-old stereo system.I can find only one thing I'd wish improved: Like many (but not all) competing products it uses one button to turn on/off pair with another Bluetooth device etc. You'll need the accompanying instruction booklet (written in clear English - no poorly-translated gibberish!) to get the tap codes right for different functions using the one button.It appears well-made & comes with a USB charging cable phono & RCA cables to connect with stereo receivers etc.
5,I have a projector that doesn’t have Bluetooth so plugging this Trond device into the AUX of my projector allows it to transmit a Bluetooth signal (switch to TX mode). All I have to do then is plug in my sound bar (or any speaker with Bluetooth) into the mains and then it on. This will receive the sound from the transmitting projector once it’s paired. In my case I made sure my sound bar was set to Bluetooth and it instantly looks for devices that is transmitting a signal at which point I double tap the button on the Trond transmitter and it instantly connected with a confirmation bleep. The Trond transmitter doesn’t get power from the AUX port so using the attached USB cable I plugged it into one of the ports on the back of my projector so it had constant power. Note… when I tried playing a movie via Amazon Prime there was no sound initially so while the movie was playing I hit the settings button on my fire stick remote and changed audio to Stereo and I had instant sound. You don’t have to use this on a projector you can use it on any device you want to transmit sound from and it also works as a receiver by changing the switch on the Trond. Excellent device!
4,This is a useful gadget for transmitting and receiving audio over bluetooth. There is no need to worry about 'power to run...' just remember that this is a gadget like most others and is designed to interface correctly with equipment that would be reasonably expected to use it. The operational distance is stated in the specifications and should meet most people's requirements. I use this to link my main hi-fi to an amplifier in my home office a distance of only about 15 feet or as an input as a receiver from my laptop so it should work and it does. This also has the advantages of being aptX compliant which means that it receives and transmits using codecs other than the original bluetooth specification codec (when the corresponding Tx and Rx unit also support these codecs) which means that using compatible units allows audio to be listened to in a less compressed (and therefore better sounding) form. I have no way of confirming that this unit is in fact aptX compliant but I have to reason to suspect that it isn't.There are only 4 little niggles that I would suggest to the development team to rectify:-1) When in receive mode from the laptop there are frequent cut-outs in the signal. Since I can stream music seamlessly via bluetooth from my laptop to my Pure Evoke F3 radio and other devices I deduce that this is a glitch in this unit.2) The switch denoting Rx (receive) and Tx (transmit) are labelled in reverse (ie switch to Rx to transmit and Tx to receive). This is slightly confusing and I believe that it contravenes the applicable European directives that allow the CE mark to be appplied (Low voltage and R&TTE at minimum) which both require markings to be clear and correct.3) When connected to a power source via USB it fails to 'wake-up' once it has gone to sleep. The only way to wake it up is to unplug it from the power source turn it off turn it on again and its ready to go.4) The output for connecting to an amplifier is a little low. Even on maximum volume setting the volume knob on my amplifier has to be set a good 20% higher that with any other piece of equipment. This is true independent of the input is is connected to and the same for whatever amplifier I have tried it with.Other than that a good product.
3,Overall this is a pretty good device. It does just like it says. You can connect to it as a bluetooth host and it outputs audio via 3.5 to whatever. Or you can make it connect to a bluetooth device and input audio via its 3.5.It is basic but does what it says and for the most part works really well.2 problems I've found.1. If you are using it like I am as a permenantly plugged in device to a desktop for bluetooth headphones they will buzz when things are quiet. Not loud or super annoying but definitely noticable. I asked and the company seems to have confirmed this can happen when the 3.5 and USB are plugged into the same device.2. Low level audio gating is pretty annoying also. What I mean by this is when the audio is very quiet it will sometimes cut out in one ear or the other. So if the volume is low it might clip and lose the end of some words or quiet music might fade in and out.Other than this I still use it daily to connect my bluetooth headphones to my desktop and it works pretty well.
5,Excellent produit je recommande fortement pour écouteur sans fil à installer sur un téléviseur :)
5,Using it to connect my earbuds/headphones to my Denon Receiver. Sounds quality and range is excellent. Exactly what I was looking for Great Product !!
5,BonjourJe recherchais pour mon Vidéoprojecteur (non bluetooth) la possibilité de transmettre le son sur mon casque sans fil pour ne pas déranger les autres.Le transmetteur branché sur la sortie OUT jack 3.5 transforme la sortie son en Bluetooth.  La connexion au casque s'est effectuée à la 1ere synchronisation. Pas de décalage de son parfait.Cable usb alimentation branché en direct sur le port alim du vidéoprojecteur aucun grésillement.En fin d'utilisation aucune manipulation a faire s'éteint tout seul avec le vidéoprojecteur.Pas besoin de refaire l'appareillage sur les utilisations suivantes.Je conseille pour ceux qui veulent rendre leur vidéoprojecteur Bluetooth pour envoyer le son sur un casque sans fil.Merci
4,First time pairing was tricky maybe due to not enough battery power and I was charging it while pairing. Second time pairing with battery power only with JBL reflect mini was easy just make sure that the headphone is disconnected from other Bluetooth device before connecting. Didn't notice any lagging in sound. Overall a good product and shipping was fast. Also received a follow up email from Trond on how to pair the device.
5,So small it's incredible. Works very well. Can be use up to a good 20 feet at least.Now I can listen to my radio station and tv without disturbing my wife.Come with everything to use it. A little charger would've been very handy since there is no USB plug near my tv set.Get yourself one and you will not regret it.p.s:  As for Rajendra Shrestha comment I found on the manual that the on-off switch exist. You must press the NFB button for 3 seconds et voila.
5,It's a great dongle for the Nintendo Switch. No perceivable lag in Zelda BOTW. Highly recommended. Pairing is easy. The battery is decent given the tiny size of the device so it's a good compromise overall. I stick behind the console when I'm out and play away with a wireless headphone and it's light enough that it doesn't affect the experience.
5,Used this to send audio from my android to my sound system while casting to a projector. Worked great.
5,I purchased your transmitter after a bad experience with a competing brand. My Trond BT-Duo 2in1 worked perfectly the first time I set it up and has continued to work perfectly since then. I bought it for my wife to help her use her iPad and TV with wireless headphones…and it has been the perfect solution.I was also impressed by the obvious care that this company is giving to ensure a good customer experience.
5,Excellent appareil.
5,I gave a  5 stars because the device worked as expected. The pamphlet inside explained cleared what to do to make it work with my earphones. That was my first device using Bluetooth . I have been using it for a couple of months and is still working perfectly. The  price was also  reasonable. If you need to convert a digital device into a Bluetooth that gadget is perfect.Aldo
5,2 units bought to be paired together to watch TV. One TX and one RX.-Paired together easily-Low latency confirmed-Can be charged while in use
5,Purchased this item for use with Bose QuietControl 30.  I fly frequently and wanted something to use with these headphones for inflight entertainment.Paired instantly with no fuss.  Tested watching video on my laptop with no lag in transmit mode.  Have not used in receive mode.  Have not tested in flight yet but flawless on my laptop test.  No discernible lag with the dongle about 3 feet from headphones.
4,I've used this for many weeks possibly months now and it hasn't faulted me to the point thatI would wanna throw it out it doesn't really have any problems worth noting bar one the connection is sublimequality is better than average "seemingly" and it just works almost as you'd want it to no complaints signal distance is mostly adequate could be a tiny bit better so could go into different rooms and still have a connection but if you are in one room it will work mostly flawlessly though it can somewhat be interfered with at an unusual and unexpected amount it's very good mostly.My only complaint would be that I had the device between my leggings and body than something happenedto the devices internal audio jack and went mono all of sudden so now the sound is only on the left side... what the heck?  won't be buying another one because of that plus their newer model seems cheaper than this one even if it worked their were very very minor issues that were another to make me want to try a better product.
2,Purchased in August - moderately used for powered speakers and just recently with headphones. Yesterday when it powers on it just blinks blue red really fast. Tried hard reset pin button. No joy.Too bad this did what it said.
5,Le seul défaut est que le volume est faible.Il faut élever le volume sur la TV à son plus fort pour bien entendre dans les pods
5,The receiver worked the way it should.  I plugged it into the headphone jack at the back of the tv.  The receiver paired quickly with my wireless headphones.
5,Works great.. I was getting some dropout because my stereo USB port did not give enough power but it works perfectly with my two bose headsets once I connected it to a better wall usb power supply
1,The cassette made such a loud grinding sound that I couldn't hear the music playing on the stereo. Threw it away and bought a Sony unit.
4,Great transmitter/receiver works without any hassle comes with required cables easy to operate. Only qualm is that audio quality is quite poor while charging (e.g. mono instead of stereo lots of static — depends on the USB port providing the power).
5,I was able to connect my iPod with garage overhead lights I received for Christmas that came equipped with bluetooth on my very first attempt. There are 2 separate lights and it was able to connect to both of them so I can enjoy music while I work in the garage. Loved that it came with both receiver and transmitter capability for the same price as competitor brand transmitter only products.
5,This product works great. Have used it in transmitter mode with bluetooth headphones and in the car as a receiver with my cell phone.  I haven't noticed any issues with audio quality.  I am very happy with this purchase.
5,Used to connect bluetooth headphones to an older TV. Great item.
4,This product does not work with my Airpods Pro. Thankfully the seller was generous enough to offer a full refund because of that
1,No battery life whatsoever I can't recommend this item. I will read the manual again but I doubt I'm doing something wrong.Allan
4,The voice and picture are not quite in sync.My old cheaper unit was better that way but the range is much better
4,It's easy to operate just a double click to get it pairing.  Some times it pairs but I don't get sound.
5,Fonctionne bien avec mes écouteurs sans fil.
5,WILL NOT BE USING TILL SPRING. HOWEVER LOOKS  TO MADE WELL  AND CUSTOMER WRITTIN SUPPORT WAS EXCELLANT THANKS
4,works well.  need to re-discover/re-pair-up with the Bluetooth headset after poweroff/poweron.
5,Works great has the cables you need it's quite small so it's easy to tuck away and it is simple to use.
5,Came very fast in good condition. Works very well thank you
3,It works but is fussy.
4,Works good. If it had on/off switch would had made the best. Bought both transmitter and headphone with aptx. No voice lag.
1,I bought 2 and they don't work...Very angry.
5,Used on my Nose wired headphones after I bought a tablet without a jack connection. Very easy; perfect sound
2,Does not easily connect to Bluetooth devices
4,does what it suppose to.
5,Works very well! Thank you
5,Worked great!
5,Parfait tel que décrit fonctionne très bien 😊
4,Useful gadget to add BT feature but poor battery life likely to be too inconvenient. Maybe if paired with a power pack but more clutter to lie forgotten in a drawer.
5,I first bought a transmitter that appeared much higher in the search results but it was very poor and I sent it back. Much happier with this one. Very well presented with well-written and clear instructions in fact comprehensive instructions obviously written with care and printed large enough that you can actually read them. The instructions make sense the indicator lights make sense and match the instructions and pairing was almost immediate with zero frustration. The unit is very very small ideal for travel. The transmitter I sent back has two prongs for airline use but hardly any aircraft have the old two prong sockets anymore so it's not a helpful feature and makes that one bulkier. This one is tiny. Even with Bose wireless earbuds that do not support low latency bluetooth with this transmitter I see almost no lag when watching video. The other one I bought had really bad lag. The sound quality of this product is good and it comes with all the cables you might need. I'm impressed with this one. The "recommended" one I bought first has gone back for aa refund. This one I'll be keeping.
5,Pour des raisons personnelles et professionnelles j’ai été amené à acheter différents émetteur/récepteur Bluetooth. J’avoue que celui-là c’est le top à tous les niveaux : configuration très simple et intuitive packaging et connexion ( différentes câbles et connectiques  fournis) documentation en français Qualité du son…. Bref ce que l’on attend d’un produit haut de gamme.Franchementje suis bluffé et recommande ce produit
5,1.  I bought this to add Bluetooth to my old iPod Classic 120GB 6th generation as I was given some wireless earbuds (Jabra Elite 65t) for my birthday. The adaptor connected to my earbuds perfectly within a minute much to my surprise.  I  cannot control volume  or pause/fast forward when connected to the iPod but that's not much of a problem as I just wanted to get rid of the usual tangle that comes with wired headphones. Sound quality is very good at least to my ears anyway.2. The second reason I wanted one was to use with our non-smart Samsung tv.  I had to experiment with the cable and audio sockets to get the best result. If I used the 3.5mm jack to  jack version in the tv headphone socket there was only sound through the earbuds. When I used the cable with the red and white ends in the matching tv sockets voila! sound through the earbuds - that I could control - and sound through the tv speaker that my husband could control to suit him. Win win!  When using with the tv the lag was barely discernable. I  had to look quite closely to detect any.I can't comment on the battery life yet as it came ready-charged but so far I am very very pleased that this tiny little box of tricks does what I need it to.  I just wish it came in white to make it easier to find in a dark handbag but that's a very minor matter. I will make a little white case to put it in :)
5,OK so pairing Bluetooth things is always a hassle but this has paired with everything i have tried. Just don't forget whether you are transmitting or receiving.So basically you plug a 3mm jack M/M (male to male) from the speaker output or audio input and then into TROND then pair it using either the TX (transmit) or RX (receive).You get roughly 8hrs playtime (it charges fast too).I have used it for the TV and i never noticed any lag or lip-sync problems. In fact i found it quite an immersive experience watching tv with my headphones on. The sound is excellent and i did not experience any sound cut out.I use it mainly to transmit Youtube from my PC to my old sony stereo which has an audio input that is connected to my Esinkin Bluetooth Wireless Audio Receiver. Sounds amazing.I truly love this this TROND transmitter.
5,Génial fonctionne même avec une coupure d'alimentation...
4,Super easy to set up and very useful set of accessories to connect to almost any existing kit.  I have had the occasional momentary drop out but it reconnects pretty rapidly. It’s not the best but for the money it’s more than acceptable.
3,Dommage car ne s'adapte pas sur une barre de son ...Renvoyé
4,We use this to connect a wireless speaker to the tv to help a hard of hearing family member. It does exactly what it was bought for but the lag in connectivity can be annoying. Lips are not in sync.
5,I purchased this great little product to transmit music etc to my Sony 900 h-ear wireless headphones from my older stereo equipment. The service and after sales communication I have received from this supplier has been exceptional. Once paired with my headphones the process does not need to be repeated. Firstly switch on the headphones then turn on the transmitter. Literally within seconds the pairing takes place automatically and the sound quality is astoundingly good much better in fact than what comes out of my freestanding speakers. I live in a large bungalow and all internal walls are of solid construction so I was initially disappointed that the bluetooth only worked within the room the transmitter was in. HOWEVER I purchased an inexpensive male to female 5 meter extension cable from G-Shield and plugged the Trond into it. I only need to place the Trond still inside but nearer to the door of the same room and I am able to get a perfect bluetooth connection in almost every room of my house with no loss of sound quality whatsoever. Only one room at the extreme end of the bungalow produces a slight crackle in sound. The connection even extends for quite a distance into my attached garage. I do not use it in reciever mode so cannot comment on this but given that it very competently meets my requirements I am delighted with this little device and what it achieves. Considering the excellent after sales service and the initial guarantee it really is worth a try. I am therefore very happy to recommend this product.
5,This is my 2nd Bluetooth Transmitter and wish I'd gotten this one 1st (it was on my shortlist).My previous one was cheaper and wouldn't hold a solid connection dropping off every 30sec or so.Glad to say no such issues (so far...) with this one. Easy to pair and sounds great. This has Aptx as do my headphones which helps complement each other.In this instance definitely get what you pay for and worth it (in my opinion)
5,Works perfect for connecting my music player to my old stereo so i can play my music through the speakers on the wall
5,Utilisé pour effectuer un pont Bluetooth entre un récepteur-adaptateur DAB+ et un autoradio ne disposant ni de port 3.5mm aux ni de bluetooth. L'autoradio de type Blaupunkt Symphony badgé SkodaAuto a été équipé sur son mini-iso destiné au changeur CD d'un adaptateur Bluetooth acheté la semaine dernière sur Amazon ( https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B072FLLVPN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) et couplé sans problème avec ce produit configuré en mode TX. Ca fonctionne du premier coup et du feu de dieu. Ca m'évite de changer mon autoradio qui est de première qualité et me permet de recevoir la DAB via mon adaptateur qui est utilisé sur plusieurs véhicules.
5,I bought two of these devices to use as a transmitter and receiver and I was impressed with the results when I tested the paired BT-DUOs outside in my garden.I'm getting at least 30 metres of line of sight communication between the two with hardly any drop out whilst playing music into the transmitter. I even had mostly useable connection at 30 to 40 metres with a little drop out but it was still very reasonable considering they are specified to have a range of about 10 metres / 33 feet so I'm getting about three times the specified range at 30 metres / 100 feet assuming their spec is for line of site communication which is what I was using to test them.I also found the audio quality and low latency very good and the devices were easy to pair.I've only just recently bought these devices so can't comment on reliability or battery life but so far I'm impressed with the performance and build quality and the devices are really small and light as well as reasonably priced and the instruction booklet is written in good English and is easy to follow.I rarely spend my time writing product reviews but I felt it appropriate on this occasion as this was a pleasant surprise as so often products from China don't meet expectations and instruction booklets are in poor english and difficult to understand.This is the first time I've dealt with this company and based on my first impressions I firmly believe it won't be the last.
3,Produkt ist klein und leicht lässt sich nur nicht mit dem Bluetooth Kopfhörer yamaha yh-e700a koppeln.
4,Plugged pit in to old separate hifi and streamed old 70's music. Brought  back a few memories. It worked really well and the sound was really good.
5,We moved 9nto a flat with a built-in music system piped to all rooms.  But it is 15 years old so no new facilities like Bluetooth or wifi with which to connect to it.  It does have an earphone socket.  The Trond unit means I can link any Bluetooth unit to the old music system.  Superb!
5,Also bin von dem Gerät positiv überrascht. Nach vielen Fehlkäufen habe endlich eins dass funktioniert..Lieferung TOP. Gestern bestellt heute schon da.Installation (an mein TV) und koppeln des Gerätes an meine Bluetooth Kopfhörer war in 5 Minuten erledigt.Bin kein Experte aber Tonqualität ist gut fast keine Störgeräusche zu hören (wie bei mehreren Geräten die ich vorher bestellt habe und dann zurück schickte) nur minimal.Bluetooth Verbindung ist gut und stabil bei mir war ich 10 Meter vom Fernseher entfernt.Also wenn jemand nicht gleich mehrere Hundert Euro ausgeben will aber ein vernünftiges Gerät sucht um Fernseher über Kopfhörer zu schauen kriegt von mir eine klare Empfehlung.RX Modus habe ich noch nicht ausprobiert. Mache ich aber noch. Wenn so weit ist ergänze ich meine Rezension.
5,parfait !
5,Neat little gadget does exactly what it says in the Amazon info. It was easy to set up according to the precise documentation provided. I pugged it in pressed the button paired it with my Apple Air Pods and bingo it worked first time.Once it has been 'paired' with your Bluetooth earbuds/earphones it remembers so you only have to pair them up the once. I can now listen to my TV Classic iPod and radio wirelessly with no problems.
5,genial j'ai pu transferer mon MP3 sur mon enceinte qui n'aceptait que le bluetooth. le son est parfait
5,Le produit marche très bien. Le vendeur est très réactif.
4,Clear instructions. Dealing with customer support was excellent.
5,Needed a new transmitter as I've bought mum Bluetooth headphones for her TV and needed to get a Bluetooth receiver for her TV. I plugged this into my TV to make sure it was low latency and there was absolutely no lag. Had a nightmare with other transmitters/receivers with my own headphones in the past with as much as a 2 second lag. Anyway this is great. Paired easily and can charge as you use if you plug it Into your TV's USB slot. Not sure why one of the reviewers were moaning about a noise coming from it I've had that on others but not this one there's obviously something interfering with theirs.
5,Pratique mais quelques fonction en plus serait pas mal
4,Easy to set up and pair. Sound quality good but no volume controls.
2,Volume is too low when sharing the bluetooth connection with another device (main use case for me).
4,kleines aber feines Gerät. Funktion als Receiver sehr gut beim Transmitter-Betrieb irritiert zunächst die benötigte Ausgangslautstärke der angeschlossenen Audio-Quelle. Funktioniert sonst wie erwartet.Als sinnvolles Zubehör werden Lade- und Audio-Adapter mitgeliefert.
5,Bought this to use as a transmitter. Paired a bedroom hi fi receiver with a bathroom Bluetooth speaker. Excellent reliable connection quality through two closed doors. Allows me to be able to easily adjust the sound volume on the Bluetooth speaker when required. This is what I wanted as I had previously had ceiling mount speakers in another bathroom that could not be adjusted from this room.Very pleased with the quality of the unit 👍.Has a very slight sound lag around 20 milliseconds but this is irrelevant for this application 😀.
5,This brought new life to an old boombox which now happily lives in my kitchen. The quality is fantastic as it's apt-x bluetooth. Small form factor and really reliable doesn't cut out or malfunction. One thing to note is: if it doesn't receive a signal after a few minutes you have to pair again. Not a problem for most applications but my boombox is on top of the kitchen cabinets out of reach. I had hoped to be able to just leave it on all the time like Sonos so when you come in the room you can just connect from your device but you have to physically tap the Trond button twice for it to pair which is does immediately. This meant I've had to order an additional 3m USB cable and 3m jack cable so I can install the Trond where I can reach it easily. Fantastic value overall though and performs impeccably.
5,I wanted to connect my record player to a set of Bluetooth headphones. It worked perfectly and the sound quality is great so easy to connect. As a plus I can also stream music from my phone to the hifi again easy to set up and sound quality as good as a CD. Perfect for me so to marks. Latency if it exists is not an issue for me so top marks.
5,I like the fact I no longer have wires trailing across the floor. Also great to use on flights
5,Received this today. Plugged in my very old but powerful laptop speakers (bass box and tweeters). and WOW.  True my speekers and Spotify playlist are awesome but this little gadget married the two up.
5,Der Empfänger funktioniert super und hat eine große Reichweite. Klangqualität ist super! Er lässt sich ein und ausschalten und verbindet sich ohne Probleme wieder mit dem Handy. So soll's sein!
5,I have a Marley 'Bag of Rhythm' (BoR) portable amplifier (1st gen.) which incorporates a 30-pin socket for inserting an older iPod. In addition the BoR and has a 3.5mm socket for connection to a different sound source a TV (say).I mainly use the BoR with my iPod but neither is equipped with Bluetooth although later models were so equipped. In order to upgrade my older equipment I had to purchase a pair of these TROND devices. They can be configured either as a receiver or a transmitter. Two of these devices are required to establish a Bluetooth link with older equipment like mine. The iPod has a 3.5mm stereo socket for the connection of headphones or earbuds. One of these devices configured as a transmitter is plugged into this socket. The other device configured as a receiver is plugged into my BoR's 3.5mm socket. Once each device is activated (switched on) they automatically establish between themselves a 'low latency' (fast) radio link. No trailing cables to get into the way or to fall over. A true wireless link. That's all there is to it.As long as the sound source and sound receiver have a standard 3.5mm stereo socket the TROND® 2 in 1 Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Audio Transmitter and Receiver should work well. Because neither my sound source nor sound receiver had Bluetooth fitted I had to purchase a pair of these devices. However if either my sound source or sound receiver had Bluetooth fitted I would only need to buy one of these devices and configure it as a receiver or transmitter as appropriate.The TROND® 2 in 1 Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Audio Transmitter and Receiver has incorporated the latest Bluetooth specification so in theory should be compatible with older Bluetooth equipment.These devices are powered from rechargeable batteries and should last around a dozen hours. They can be charged whilst in use if required.
2,When it works. It works great. Can’t fault sound quality. Pairing first time took a bit of time. Not been able to pair it again since ! It was to work with original iPod and some wireless earphones. Not great given unreliable nature of pairing !
3,item seems well made but couldn't get an old ipod nano to pair with my sony bluetooth headphones.
5,Without doubt one of the best last minute purchases I’ve made. I needed a device to let me listen to in flight movies on a plane using my Apple AirPod Pro Bluetooth headphones.This device delivers on that basic usage perfectly. I put my AirPod case in pairing mode turned on the Trond transmitter by pressing the single button for 3 seconds and quickly the two were paired. This was indicated by the flashing red/blue light ring around the power button turning to blue. Put the AirPods in my ears and they connect immediately.Connecting options are a male to male 3.5mm jack or a male to male 3.5mm jack cable. Plug in to flight arm rest power on the Trond device AirPods in ears and immediately your are listening to in flight audio. I used for 8.5 hour flight and only charged it briefly from the in flight USB port also while listening. My AirPods needed charging long before this would have ran out!!There’s a switch to allow Transmit or Receive mode. Device itself is small as shown plastic has that slightly rubber quality feel to it. Box is simple card and the 8 page English instructions easy to follow.
4,This Bluetooth adapter is an interesting but at times frustrating device. As the name suggests it is a transmitter and receiver so it can be attached to either a source which does have Bluetooth built in such as a TV or radio or "dumb" earbuds or headset.The sound is quite good (although I don't think Bluetooth is as good as direct connection anyway) but I only have standard kit and haven't been able to experience AptX.The frustration is that the only indicator is a bi-colour LED that is fitted behind the on / off push button and it is difficult to know what is happening as the device pairs.
3,Connecting these as a transmitter is fiddly at best starts to cut out when more than 2 metres away so unless you are sitting right up to the TV screen then useless.Receiver is the same.
1,If you watch a film/video at a comfortable volume setting  it constantly mutes scenes on scenes with only quiet background/ambience or even quiet music destroys the atmosphere the makers were trying to create.The clincher was trying to watch the blu-ray of Aliens which has a very dynamic DTS soundtrack (mixed to 2.0 obviously) - the title and end themes consisting of very quiet violins and eerie wind-like sounds and dozens of scenes with only ambience noise footsteps and such disappear unless you crank the volume on the input device (a PC USB soundcard in this case) right up.I ran some tests with an audio editor and the range from just below the Trond clipping/distorting (i.e. 'full scale') down to where it mutes is ***49dB***!!!! That's a ***6-bit***dynamic range (as compared to the 14+ bits / 90+dB even cheapest audio gear usually manages)! To put that in perspective cassette tapes without NR had hiss at c. -55dB.People who only listen to monotonously loud music to create a "wall of sound" when they're out-and-about might never notice it but it's totally unfit for anything remotely like 'critical listening' such as .... watching a movie.ETA >>I returned the Trond and just received an Avantree Oasis (twice the price of this one) in the faint hope it might be better. Ran the same tests and it isn't - very marginal improvement of 1-2 dB but the same muting at low volume.So there we have it - APTX-LL's dirty little secret.The fast encoding/decoding (hence low latency/lag) is achieved by massively truncating the bit-depth (the amount of data to process) to around 6 bits or if you like simply throwing away 8-10 bits of the  14-16 bits that most software and hardware operate at. I reckon the old adage "there's no such thing a free lunch" was never more apposite.There is no acknowledgment of this very serious limitation anywhere online that I can find no-one seems to have run the simple tests that reveal it and even more oddly very few people have simply NOTICED it when listening.
5,Wow! Like others I was sceptical about buying this but it's fantastic how such a small thing can work so brilliantly. I bought it to link up my 15 year old hifi system to my 2 new Echo 4's. Once I'd figured out the instructions it was so easy to set up seconds in fact. The only thing I seem to be having a problem with is making both Echoes play at the same time it seems to only be playing on one or the other - I'm sure I'll figure it out at some point. But yes extremely pleased. And super fast delivery too.
4,This little device is very effective - allows me to play music on my MP3 player through a BOSE speaker which is great. From experience it is possisble to get too close to the speaker. app one metre appart works best
4,We had been looking for a while for a device that would allow one of us to watch our TV in the bedroom while the other slept. The problem was the sound so we were looking for a solution that could easily be plugged in when required and which would link up to Bluetooth headphones. It had to have good enough responses to keep the sounds in sync with the picture. The Trond unit fitted our requirements. Plugging it into the earphone jack on our TV cut out the speakers. Do make sure that your TV has an earphone jack and that it will cut out the speakers when used. Once plugged in it was a matter of a couple of minutes to pair it up with our BT headphones as we were listening to our TV. This is a unit that we only use when one of us wants to sleep and the other to watch which is not an everyday occurrence so we have not used the Trond much since getting it but our first impression is that it is simple to set up (so long as you have the right TV) and works well
5,this product is really good set it up to multiple different speakers however it does reduce the noise quality a bit probably so it doesn't blow up any speakers yeah very small but would definitely recommend to family and friends if they are setting up surround sound.
5,For those that are curious on this. I tried to use this to connect two nest mini speakers at same time using my monitor with a chromecast with google tv as my tv. First it was out of sync then i restarted the bluetooth transmitter and both speakers connected at same time and stayed in sync. Not sure yet about long use.
3,Nach einer Empfehlungen für diesen Bluetooth Transmitter um 2 Bluetooth Empfänger gleichzeitig zu Koppeln (Kopfhörer+Soundbar) habe ich diesen gekauft.Anfangs war die Koppelung einfach und hat alles funktioniert.Nach ca. 2 Wochen in Benutzung war auf einer Kopfhörer Seite kein Ton mehr und die Soundbar hat sich nicht mehr mit dem Transmitter Verbunden!!!Jetzt habe ich in einem Laden 2 einzelne billig Tansmitter gekauft die einwandfrei funktionieren.
3,The quality of the music is good. Very easy to connect.But there is a lag so listening to music is fine but when you want to watch movies it's not convenient as the lips and sound are not in sync!!
3,I wanted to use the device to wirelessly link to an electronic piano.  I wanted to use my Bose QC35 II headphones or my Bose QC earbuds to link to the Trond.  The problem was a significant latency between the key press and hearing the note through the headphones.  According to the Trond in-pack advice this was due to the fact that both Bose products (although relatively new) did not have the aptx low latency capability.  If you want to use the Trond in this way check that your headphones have this capability (or buy headphones that do!)
3,Le son est tout à fait correct mais inutisable avec un instrument. Dans mon cas avec un piano électrique. Je reviens au casque filaire.
3,Bought as on set tinnitus so could use headphones to increase volume but did not improve things there was a delay from the the TV and had turn volume on headphones up which was not idealHad to return
5,Fantastic now able to play our collection of cd’s on our Sonos speaker.
5,I bought this as I wanted to use my bluetooth (Vidonn bone conduction) headphones with my TV as they would not pair with it directly.  After reading the reviews I was a bit worried about the potential issue with the latency as I couldn't confirm if my headphones worked with aptx low latency. I thought I would give this a try anyway though and thankfully I have found it to work perfectly.  Set up was easy as you just switch the Trond to transmit mode via the switch and then put both the Trond and headphones in pairing mode whilst holding them near to each other.  Once done just plug the Trond into the TV (I'm using the 3.5 mm jack) and away you go.  I haven't used this in receiver mode but I imagine that would also work fine.  I would definitely recommend this and would buy it again.
4,I was initially disappointed with the product as when I tried it with my Avantree Aptx LL transmitter the sound was crackly. However I have since been trying with other devices and with those it works great. So I can only assume it is just a random glitch between the two specific devices. When paired to other devices such as a standard aptx bluetooth dongle or my phone it has good quality sound and is easy to pair. I have not yet had the chance to use this as a transmitter however when I do I will update my review further.I would also like to extend a massive thanks to Trond customer services who have bent over backwards to try and help me solve the problem with the Avantree transmitter.
5,Arrived a day early easy to set up and connect to Marshals speaker.  Two different and at same time from an I pod and also tried from portable CD player great sound seems to hold charge  Highly recommended
4,I bought this for the application of playing guitar the latency is long so sound is a split second after the pluck. Reading the instructions I need to buy a pair of their headphones to lose the latency. I didn't do my homework so if you buy for guitar beware. There is more tech to it but my new headphones don't support  so I have to buy a new pair of headphones. Personally I thought it would be the analogue to digital conversion causing the delay but apparently not. I would hate to buy the new headphones and still have a little latency.
5,Falta un manual que  detalli totes les possibilitats.
3,This review refers to TROND 2-in-1 Bluetooth V5.0 Transmitter Receiver/Wireless 3.5mm Audio Adapter.Not so much a product defect as a warning to prospective buyers - check the device you intend to use this with supports "Aptx LL". If (like my Sony WH-H900N headphones) they state just "Apx" then you WILL have a noticeable lag between video and audio its actually 0.12s but makes a massive difference anything with dialog is really unwatchable. Aptx LL reduces the delay to 0.04s and I confess I haven't tried that but if you only have Aptx then save your money this won't be usable.  This IS stated on the posting for the device but you have to search for it and I confess I did not at first realise the difference that little "LL" bit makes!
5,I did a lot of research into a Bluetooth transmitter for my stereo so I could use my new Senneheiser bluetooth headphones with it. I was a bit dubious about this Trond unit. Having not heard of the manufacturer before. Considering how small it is. After a few pairing issues( getting my headphones to go into pairing mode being the problem) the two units paired. I connected it to my CD player headphone jack and was then amazed at the quality of the sound. It is superb. The bass is good and strong and everything else is crisp and clear. I even really tested it at full volume from the headphone jack there was no discernible degradation in sound or distortion. The headphone jack volume is variable on my CD player. (an old but still very good Harman Kardon CD player) I even left the room and didn't experience any drop off. I haven't tested it at its 10 metre limit yet. I doubt I'll be using it anywhere near it's limit. Would I recommend it? Absolutely! Amazon had it at the best price. Another well known online seller was at least £5 more.
5,The product works well and is easy to setup - unlike stated in other reviews.All good for me
2,LIRE AU BOUT - La transmition se fait bien mais alors un sifflement horrible prend le dessus en permanence testé avec des ecouteur et un casque bluetooth ... meme resultat...j'ai resolu le probleme sur batterie aucun soucis c'etait correct. Mais des que je le banchais horrible. J'ai changé le bloc et je l'ai mis sur une prise a part tout seul et la comme sur batterie c'est correcte ! je repasse de 1 a 3 etoiles
2,Klein funktioniert. Wenn man hinter das System des Koppelns gekommen ist konnte ich mit sämtlichen Bluetooth-Kopfhörern koppeln. Tonqualität passt auch am TV. Hier teilweise ein leichtes unterschwelliges Rauschen hörbar. Nicht immer nur zeitweise. Eine Kleinigkeit stört mich. Dachte das längere Klinkenkabel könnte ich auch für die Funktion des Transmitters nutzen leider nicht so. Statt dessen muss der fixe Klinken-Adapter genutzt werden. Stört beim MP3-Player im der Tasche etwas. Sehe da schon eine potentielle Quelle einer Beschädigung.Nachtrag: verbindet sich nicht mehr mit den Kopfhörern. Diese bereits resettet nichts gebracht. Neu koppeln - findet nichts verbindet keine Kopfhörer mehr. Schade
5,The product came well packaged (usual cardboard box design) and included a micro-USB cable for charging a male to male 3.5mm for audio output to a HiFI/car stereo system and a female 3.5mm to RCA connector for alternative connections.The sound quality seems to be good and since it uses the recent CSR 8670 chipset it supports modern bluetooth technologies such as v4.1 and apt-x encoding. However upon testing the system it only seems to be able to encode apt-x audio streams and not decode them meaning it does not function as an apt-x receiver and only as a transmitter. Having said this I am not aware of any bluetooth products currently that are able to do this (all of the ones that supposedly support apt-x currently are encoders only) and so I cannot reduce my rating of the device for this.Battery life is good and reaches the quoted 8 hours of run time (slightly less when in RX mode) which is surprising given the relatively small 160mAh battery and very small receiver design (approx 4.5x3.5x1.0 cm). The build quality is solid and the rubberised feel gives it a good finish. The ability to clip it to a shirt or belt would be handy but would also add to the bulk of the device so I can understand the compromise.Overall this is a great buy if you are looking to convert audio tech into a bluetooth-compatible device and retain great sound quality and the price of £20 that I paid is reasonable compared to alternative products.
4,Does what I wanted. Only gripe is having to reset it every time I try to connect to a different device.
5,I bought this Bluetooth transmitter to overcome the limitation of my laptop which only permits the Bluetooth connection to 1 device at a time.I wanted to connect two sets of headphones to the laptop so that my wife and I could do online exercise classes using the laptop out in the garden without annoying our neighbours with loud music.The operation of this transmitter is really simple and the headphones connected easily once having been connected they connect automatically next time as you would expect.The transmission range is excellent and we are able to exercise freely up to about 10m away without loss of sound or sound breakup.I have tried it with several types of headphones and all worked well so I can definitely recommend this product.I can't comment on the battery life because I always power it from the USB socket when in use.
5,Arrived fast free post well packed from Trond/Amazon.  Trond BT-DUO with cables instructions and a 'welcome card' in its own small printed cardboard box neatly compartmentalised. Good comprehensive instructions with illustrations. Excellent physical quality/looks.Review based on initial 1 hour test /performance. As yet I do not have a second device that is Bluetooth 5 so test was Bluetooth 4 and Aptx or driving 2 headsets not tested. Tested TX music from Ipod 3.5mm out to BT-DUO - paired fast with a Sony Soundbar. Tested RX from a Samsung Smart TV Bluetooth 'Headphones'  signal to BT-DUO with Headset plugged to it via 3.5 mm jack -- paired on 2nd attempt (Samsung TV cause) . Great sound in TX and RX modes ---no loss or distortion within 30' spec range --even with walls and doors. STILL WORKING at 40' and between 40' and 45' slight to full drop-out. Nb. this test was during first hour of full charged battery.  Excellent sound quality. Although not Aptx tested ensuring Smart TV Sound latency setting set to Zero I could not detect lip synch issues. I have multiple uses for the BT-Duo.
5,This was incompatible with my mini hi-fi; however Trond provided excellent service and an immediate refund.
5,Perfect for pairing my iPod Classic with a smart speaker.
4,A good Blue tooth receiver. I have not used it as a transmitter. The only drawback is that it does not work while charging.
3,Everything works fine no delay with aptx but for my application there is a problem.Don't buy this if you're looking to connect 2 speakers separately (through the 2 simultaneous device connection feature) as stereo speakers there is an ever so slight delay causing sound to be horrible overall and everything sounds like a slight echo (because the output of the 2 isn't fully synced). Works fine for music but not so much for movies or anything like that.Seems to be an issue with the product for sure on initial sync it works great and slowly starts drifting to being unsynced
5,Pour écouter ma TV avec des écouteurs Bluetooth. Juste à brancher le "TROND BT-DUO" attendre 10 secondes pour qu'ils se connectent et ensuite tranquille.... 😊👍
5,Simple to install sound quality very good
5,Great sound quality works very well. I've used it at many many parties & barbecues it's very easy to use. I own a few vintage 80s boomboxes & this tiny miracle box turns my boomboxes into a modern Bluetooth sound system. I also use this in my powerful hi-fi amp & BOY It sounds AMAZING!!! I purchased a longer jack plug to phono stereo cable just so that I'm able to position it around the systems without it having to be stuck at the back. It can be used to receive Bluetooth also to transmit to another Bluetooth device......How good is that!!!! I'd say the battery lasts about 5-6 hours but then I plug it in & continue using it whilst it is charging.....Another major bonus. This has been a fantastic purchase which I use a lot. Parties have come alive because of this tiny unit.
3,I have been using it in transmit mode (connected to a DAB radio) and have not tried out receive mode.  I had difficulties connecting to a similar device attached to a decent speaker.  It *often* would connect eventually but involved much button pressing on both devices and much cursing.  It's difficult to apportion blame - hence the middle of the road score.  When it did connect the sound was fine!The similar device on the decent speaker has connected easily to devices like my phone or tablet - where you get some feedback as to what's going on.In the end I used a wired connection 100% reliable until you blunder into it!
5,So I brought this for my headphones for watching TV at night when everyone's in bed it works exactly as it should connects easily with no issues and everything was in sync to those that have said that it didn't work because it was out of sync please be aware that your headphones will only be in sync if they are true APTX LL I have tested this with 2 sets of headphones one is definitely true APTX LL and the other one isn't and I can confirm that the headphones that are true APTX LL were in perfect sync the other set was not so I know that this transmitter definitely works as long as this lasts and doesn't suddenly stop working I will definitely be glad I brought it and for the price I feel it is worth it 👍
5,My husband and I live in a flat which is regrettably sandwiched between occasionally noisy neighbours. It can sometimes be difficult to tell if the bloodcurdling screams are coming from them or the gory horror films we like watch late at night. So we bought ourselves each a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones to watch TV. Having gone through the saga of using a headphone splitter which also splits the sound (why do all TV's only have one output?!) and evil trailing cables around the room just waiting to send you flying in the dark I suddenly had a flash of inspiration to look into Bluetooth. Having read reviews for similar items we decided upon trying this gadget and we're delighted we did it's a little gem. This is a great buy if you are looking to convert audio tech into a bluetooth-compatible device. We thought initially that the connection was cutting out when some programmes had short pauses in sound between speech for example.  But that only happens with some programmes for whatever reason so rest assured the device is fine and with no lip sync issues at all. The only teeny downside is that it has to be charged via USB but that said it charges to full capacity very quickly. In conclusion it's a great product at a great price and a god send for two people to watch TV with headphones.
4,So far this handy little gadget has been great it DID allow both mine and my partners bluedio headphones to connect at the same time right up to the point where I had to get my headphones replaced thanks to a faulty power button(bluedio T2 headphones). I upgraded to the bluedio T3 headphones and can't get both of our headphones to stream at the same time no amount of unpairing and repairing has worked the end result is always the same my partners headphones connect and get sound but mine just connect and get nothing spent far too many hours trying to sort it out! All of that being said this Bluetooth streamer is brilliant  sound quality is spot on there's virtually no lag in the sound been using it to play games and watch movies on my pc! It's a brilliant product the only con being the compatability issue I had with my bluedio T3 and dual streaming.
5,As a transmitter for Headphones or Bluetooth Speaker it is very good having bought cheaper devices this is far superior. I didn’t find any background noise as in cheaper devices. There is no volume control but that would be a bit silly as the headphones or Bluetooth Speakers would have volume control being the receiving end. Range I found to be about 8 to 10 meters very good you can walk about a room un-cumbered by wires. You can buy Bluetooth transmitters with a greater range but the cost goes up and they become more complicated. This run on rechargeable batteries but I found the more expensive long range ones require a power supply usually USB connection.
5,Overall... it's a great device and saves a lot of potential headaches with other products.! main downside is using on my PC through the headphone jack.The music sound quality is not on the level of a USB bluetooth dongle. (which is no real surprise but it may be useful information if not using some high end PC etc etc)Very good direct from a CD player the occasional distortion but impressive performance overall.It solved a problem with connecting my AVR to Sennheiser momentum 3 which is the main reason I bought this.
5,Easy to set up sound quality excellentBut it stopped working reason I don’t knowIt connects ok but no sound comes out
5,These wee devices are fantastic they connect nice and easily and the latency is unreal. I use this with an avantree long range Bluetooth transmitter and I could still get near no latency through to the floor below me and outside through a brick wall! Honestly if you want a bluetooth transceiver please don't look further than this little device.Also with BLE included the battery lasts for a full days listening even though it's only 160mah.
1,Connection was fine with no lag in audio so speech matched propels mouths talking in videos. One thing though which was so annoying to point where I have stopped using this was that (I don't know how to describe exactly but there is probably a technical term that exists) there is silence when there is no sound but silence is like it has turned off and then when there is sound this accompanies like some very subtle but noticeable background static like sound which if it was on constantly you would get used to and the brain would filter it out but because it comes and goes so frequently you become acutely aware of it particularly the coming and going of the noise rather than the noise itself. After maybe 20 mins or so it was driving me crazy!
4,Brought to use aa a transmitter on my TV in the gym so I didn't have to have the volume up loud.Out of the box it worked first time. No need to charge for me as my TV has a USB socket I use for constant power.My headphones connected first time and the volume levels are good.The only 2 cons I have found are;-I have to pair my headphones overtime for some reason. not a massive issue as it takes about 10 seconds-Random different audio delay times on each use. It never stays the same delay amount. Luckily my TV has audio delay options and again doesn't take too long if you know what you're doing. Obviously using audio only wouldn't matter but all bluetooth transmitters will have some delay.A good product that works for me. I may consider another to use as a receiver upstairs.
5,Perfect
5,Was worried it would be too cheap and not be up to scratch having bought a cheap product before that did not work. However was pleasantly surprised. Easy to set up lots of useful connections and has given my old iPods a new lease of life.
4,I have this so I can use Bluetooth headphones with my switch xbox and ps4. I don't have the best headphones so the poopy sound quality isn't the fault of the product. I tried it as a receiver on my Bluetooth headphones and the sound quality was great as I'd hoped. Battery lasts about 4-6 hours depending on what you're using it for so I'd say I'm happy with that!
3,I bought this to work with my Panasonic TV it does work but I have yet to get two headsets working with it.There is also a time lag so if watching TV there is a lip sync problem.I cannot say I am impressed with it but will keep it to use with audio in car and PC
5,along with my wireless headphones my best purchase this year
5,Tried a cheaper alternative which was hopeless this was easy to set up and connected. Highly recommended.
4,This was fine for a month then it would not pair up with anything so one star (only because you have to). Trying to use the Amazon warranty (as in if it packs up after 30 days) is a nightmare at the moment. £25 down the pan? Maybe.I mailed Trond and they came back with the info on how to reboot so apologies from me and good on them.
4,Bought a trond BT duo and a pair of BT headphones hoping for the best but half expecting the worst - blue tooth seems to have a mind of its own sometimes!Followed instructions for both and it worked straight off. One minor panic worth noting which sounds obvious.... Make sure source volume is well up and headphone volume is up. silent phones for no good reason is the obvious panic!havent tried the rx functions yet nor tested battery life
2,Auf der Suche nach einer Möglichkeit mein TV Gerät über den Kopfhörerausgang mit meinem Bluetooth Kopfhörer zu verbinden bin ich bei dem Gerät gelandet. Die Einrichtung an sich ging relativ zügig. Leider hat die Leistung des Gerätes aber nicht überzeugt: Bei leiseren Tonpassagen schaltet der Stream immer wieder ab man hört nichts und hat Aussetzer (hatte ich bei einem anderen China-Gerät ebenfalls). Nach etwas Suche bin ich jetzt beim Sennheiser 508258 BT T100 Bluetooth-Audio-Transmitter gelandet der einwandfrei funktioniert. Kostet zwar ein paar Euro mehr aber was bringt mir ein günstigeres Gerät dass sonst nicht funktioniert.
5,I bought this product because Sony TVs do not have the A2DP bluetooth profile that is needed in order for bluetooth headphones/speakers to work. Reviews here suggested this transmitter/receiver would meet my needs and it seemed likely that the Trond Wireless Bluetooth V4.2 Over Ear Headphones would be compatible so I bought these too. Being a little hard of hearing this device enables me to listen to the tv using wireless headphones while at the same time my wife can listen with the inbuilt tv speakers. Setting up was not easy for me but Trond Customer Support were very willing and helped me to work out what needed to be done. Pairing of the transmitter and headphones is straightforward.The transmitter is then connected to the TV headphone socket using the 3.5mm audio lead. I understand this set up is peculiar to Sony TVs so it might be different for other TV makes. The headphones are comfortable and the sound quality is good but the volume controls are a bit fiddly. That said there are absolutely no lip sync issues. Overall a practical and v good value for money buy.
2,Wanted it for TV but the supplied cable for right and left audio didnt work. Only 3.5mm worked. Wont connect to sound bar easily and noticeable lip sync delay. No volume control on board. Bought a 10 pound dongle which has almost no delay and better connectivity with sound. Price promoted shouldnt be more that 10 pound i suggest!
5,All good with this product. Highly recommended and a lot more compact and discreet than expected .
5,I never never written a review so quickly! I'm so impressed!Positives:- Comes in (almost) frustration free packaging- Includes the red and white RCA cables (I saw a similar unit at the same price but picked this over it simply because it includes this extra cable)- Super easy setup; no need for an instruction manual- If you do need the instructions they are very clear clear diagrams well laid out ALL ENGLISH and even includes an FAQ on the back!- Good warranty (18 months) and they provide a support email address in the package- IT'S SO SMALL! It looks larger in the photo but in reality it's no bigger than a custard cream or a few 50 pence pieces- Most importantly... I notice ZERO difference between this unit and a 3.55mm lead/wired connection. FANTASTIC! Heavy bass (remember how you feel it depends on your headphone very clear honestly no difference between a wired connectionNegatives:- The method for pairing two devices is a little confusing; it's not as easy as just turn on the transmitter connect A and connect B.- No instructions on how to reset the product in the event the pairing went wildly wrong or otherwise how to remove it's memory
4,Not much to say except they work. Entered pairing mode ( Both the Trond BT and headphones had to be flashing blue and red on the LED's ) and connected to my BT Sony Headphones. Once it's paired simply switch my headphones on and press the button and they re-connect. Press to disconnect and my headphones are free to connect to my phone/tablet. No complaints about the sound clear with no dropouts. Only 4* as a bit pricey.
5,Absolutely spot on! Works with my Sony PSHX500 vinyl record player. Bluetooth to my Marshall headphones what a triumph
1,The range on this was maybe a metre two at the most before the audio starts to break up and lose connection - this happened with three different speakers. Don't waste your money
5,I almost spent money I don't have on a smart watch so that I could have music when running. Instead I tried this little gadget with my old iPod shuffle and it is perfect! I can now use my Bluetooth ear-pods with my old Shuffle. This is a fantastic little gadget and the sound is really good. I'm very happy with the purchase. This is only my first day using it but so far so good! Recommended!
5,I bought the item to use it solely as a Bluetooth transmitter (non Bluetooth TV to Bluetooth headphones). Not much more to add other than it works perfectly and it's easy to set up as it comes with clear instructions. Plugged in the headphone jack socket permanently and powered from one of the tv's USB sockets. Once set up it does not need any further adjustments. Sound quality is brilliant and most importantly there is no sound lag which was my biggest worry when ordering. I would recommend it just make sure your bluetooth devices are compatible before purchasing.
5,The Trond Bluetooth Transmitter Receiver is Brilliantit came super quick excellent quality crisp sound. Very compatible using on an old Sony Hi Fi .  Would highly recommend it it's brilliant value for money and an excellent product.
5,Superb little easy to use and easy to pair Bluetooth adapter. Fabulous sound quality. I don’t see how this could be bettered. Just ordered another.
4,Sound quality is surprisingly great at this price. No mic battery life is ok charges reasonably fast. No frills but very competent performer.
5,Bought so that I can enjoy music from my turntable through Bluetooth headphones. Works brilliantly
2,I have only tried the device in TX mode transmitting the audio from my TV. Unfortunately this was enough to show up its major problem:If the volume in a scene drops below a certain threshold for example after one character has finished speaking the audio gets cut completely. Then when the next piece of dialog begins the audio starts up again too slowly with a noticeable chunk of audio at the beginning of the sentence missing."Pleased to meet you" sounds more like "eased to meet you".This has nothing to do with any Bluetooth audio lag making the audio lag behind the video. Using my aptX headphones the lag was acceptable.The rationale behind dropping the audio stream and picking it up again might be to preserve battery power not having to transmit very quiet moments.Whatever the reason it makes the device utterly unusable for any content that is not a constant stream of loudness.I will return my TROND as it is not the right tool for the job.
5,Bought this to use with a Denon HiFi unit which didn't have Bluetooth phone output together with a pair of ear buds. Pairing took a few seconds and the TROND transmitter was plugged into the phono socket. Output quality is good for ear buds though I haven't tried a pair of high fidelity headphones. No sign of dropout or signal interruption as I moved around the ground floor of my average sized house. Battery life seems as claimed but I will probably just charge the unit every other day anyway. The transmitter can be plugged directly into a phono socket or connected via a short cable (provided). I am using the latter as I found that the unit protruded too far from the front of my HiFi unit when plugged in directly. Other users will choose the former. Time will tell but I would recommend so far.
3,Expected longer Battery life for the price.
4,I have fully charged the battery and it doesn't even last an hour it basically has to be plugged in all the time from my experience.
4,I bought this to use primarily as a Bluetooth receiver for some wired headphones but as soon as I opened the box I realised the device (which is surprisingly small as everyone says) does not have a headphone volume control. It did pair ok with my Avantree transmitter and link in Low Latency mode as intended.For me the lack of a volume control (and too low a volume with my headphones and TV/transmitter combination) meant that the device was of no use to me so I returned it.
5,Works perfectly to enable me to use blue tooth headphones with my old amplifier.  I just plug it into the headphone socket.
5,Brilliant. Worked straight out of the box and great range of connections in the box. It's really tiny as well. I've used it as a Bluetooth transmitter out of a phono pre amp. Perfect no problem pairing and if it keeps working like this then it is one of those golden gadgets that just works and doesn't make a fuss.
5,Nella confezione sono inclusi tutti i cavi necessari per il corretto funzionamento: un cavo jack da 35mm un cavo micro-usb USB e un cavo RCA- 35 mm femmina.Si può colleganre tramite cavo a qualsiasi radio o impianto audio non bluetooth si riuscirà a trasformarlo in una vera postazione per ricevere audio provenienti da smartphone o tablet.Il segnale audio viene trasmesso allo stereo di casa in modo pressoché impeccabile senza alcuna distorsione. Il sonoro è pulito piacevole da ascoltare e ovviamente continuo.Ancor più importante (io l’ho scelto proprio per questa funzione) è la funzione trasmettitore. In questo modo ad esempio è possibile mettere in comunicazione una Tv un vecchio stereo ecc con un altoparlante bluetooth o magari una cuffia. Per esempio collegando il trasmettitore all’uscita audio del televisore. Fantastico.L’abbinamento tra apparecchi è estremamente semplice: per collegare il trasmettitore ad una cassa bluetooth per esempio premete per 9 secondi il tasto ovviamente con la cassa bluetooth accesa e il gioco è fatto.Per attivare la modalità trasmettitore anzitutto occorre spostare l’apposito pulsante su “TX”; occorre fare questa operazione a periferica spenta dato che non è possibile cambiare modalità di utilizzo da TX a RX (o viceversa) quando è acceso.
5,Ich habe meine Sony Overear Noise Canceling Kopfhörer und meine AirPods Pro erfolgreich damit Pairen können. Was nicht funktioniert hat aber vielleicht bin ich auch zu dämlich dafür dass zwei Bluetooth Geräte mit dem Teil funktionieren
4,I have used it twice in the plane and have to say that this device is a convenience for people who want to use their bluetooth headphones. Works perfectly and the battery lasts as well. The only issue I found was that there was a slight hissing noise which would not go away even after using an airline adapter to make sure the wire sits correctly.
5,Great little bluetooth transmitter/ receiver. Very light & tiny can easily fit into a pocket. Clear instruction booklet. Comes with a range of different adaptors & charging cable. Has a good signal range even indoors between different rooms. Good outdoor range great  for listening to bluetooth earbuds when gardening etc. Have used with mp3 player & also with hi-fi unit & gives good sound through both.
5,I do not normally give reviews but this is an exception as it is certainly worth the money. The transmitter/receiver hasmade a bigbig difference especially for watching movies . the  sound is crisp and clear and the sound sync is spot on.We always had trouble before buying this as I wear hearing aids and my wife has particularly good hearing making it difficult to watch telly because I needed more volume  than my wife did.  I plugged the  transmitter into the back of my sky+box and now I can have the volume on my headphones as high or low as I want and my wife  can set the tv volume  at any level she requires Oh perfect bliss...... No more arguments. absolutely first class.
5,More than I expected
5,I bought this device to be able to work with my video camera without being tethered by a headphone lead. It works great. The device is beautifully packaged and presented with lots of extra connectors and has a nice professional feel to it. Pairing can be hit and miss but I persevered and in the end I was rewarded with two solid blue lights. The one thing to watch out for is latency. There is a noticeable delay on sound which in some circumstances will be annoying. As I simply want to check levels that is not a problem for me and there are headphones available that perfectly match the tx to reduce the delay. I did not use the device as a receiver. Added bonus Amazon delivered the package 2 days early. There were a lot of follow up e-mails from Trond explaining how to pair in detail so I imagine people have difficulty!
4,I've had 3 of this type of device over the past years. So far this has proved to be good. Sound delay is not significant. Adjustment for quality is more on the TV. I have 2 almost indentical phones. One connects 1 doesn't. Overall so far the Trond is the best.
5,Macht genau das was es soll.
5,I've been using this little gizmo to stream audio from my Virtual Reality setup to my laptop for recording via OBS. I could record from the microphone fine enough but had real issues with recording the actual gameplay audio. A Pair of these resolved that issue. One set up as a transmitter plugged into the head set and the other as a receiver plugged into the PC. Audoi is clear and crisp little latency to speak of too. Really impressed comsodering the cost of them. Recommended addition for all you budding VR streamers.
5,This Bluetooth transmitter works really well. I found it would not pair with my Sony headphones even though both devices were in pairing mode. Double tapping the transmitter button enabled instant pairing. Using the Trond low latency headphones no problems with pairing and absolutely no lip sync problems. Very reliable auto connects to last used device. To connect to another paired device just tap transmitter button. Connecting to two headphones is easy but no low latency mode.
4,This does what it says just not quite as well as you would like. It needs volume controls turned up very high to get an acceptable headphone volume. However I have not found a situation where it doesn't work. I'm happy-ish.
5,I wanted a transmitter for my old iPod Mini and this one does the job. It is a big as the iPod. However now that it is wireless I can put it in my bag and size doesn’t matter. As it is either a transmitter or receiver there is no option to switch songs with your bluetooth headphones.
4,This little device is truly amazing. Turning any speaker into bluetooth compatible is really great especially nowadays! This works really well with any speakers and the bluetooth has been only tested with my Sennheiser Momentum and Samsung Galaxy S7 also with a laptop (Lenovo yoga 2). Why only 4 stars if it was truly amazing? Well noise distortion may appear if you are charging the device at the same time only with a more premium charging cable can be used if you want to charge and use it at the same time! Otherwise nothing to complain about also the service is amazing. Fast response and informative!
4,Sound and connectivity really good only give 3 stars for volume as i use a surround sound system to connect it to and use the volume control on that so don't use the volume control.I can go upstairs or in the garden and still get a connection but breaks up at end of the garden ( approx 12 to 14M).Happy with it so far.
4,Product gives Bluetooth facility to older TV and works with headphones and earbuds. There is a bit of a delay in voice synchronisation with what's on screen but although annoying it doesn't distract too much
5,Geniales kleines Gerät das sowohl als Sender (z. B. Fernseher - Buds) als auch als Empfänger (z. B. Handy - Stereo Anlage) funktioniert. Wird einfach per USB aufgeladen.
5,This is a cracking little piece of kit! Allows me to turn my old TV in to one that I can connect my bluetooth earphones to for listening in bed and of course is great because it means I can alter the volume with my TV remote. No lag so people's lips are in sync with sound. Easy to pair and battery life is good. Good to know that I could also use this as a bluetooth receiver if need be.
5,Have used this little unit for a few months now and love it. Use it permanently into the headphone socket of my tv and with a power USB cable attached keeping it charged. I use a pair of Mpow Magneto in-ear headphones and the combination has excellent audio quality even for classical concerts which is the best gauge. I had a couple of strange problems at first when I went out of range I.e my kitchen with the phones on the phones went into sleep mode and the Trond went into sleep mode and I could not turn it on or off and had to wait until the next day until it had run down before I could restart it. Now I automatically take the phones off before I leave the room and have had no further problems. I would thoroughly recommend this unit and indeed the earphones to go with it.I have to say also that I contacted customer support and their response to my initial problems were excellent.
5,Only used TX feature so far and works fine with a Sony BT speaker I used max volume on HiFi and adjusted down on the speaker in the next room.
5,I was a bit concerned about buying this product. A few online articles made the process of Bluetooth enabling your tv rather complicated and I’m no techie! Also £25 for a gamble seemed quite a lot.I needn’t of worried. The setting up and pairing couldn’t have been more straightforward. It worked first time. Amazing. Online articles say that latency - ie headphone sound synchronised with tv sound (get me I suddenly give appearance of knowing what I’m talking about) can be a problem. Not with this device - everything synchronised fine.The device plugs into the audio out sockets on the tv (whilst still retaining tv speaker output) and is tiny. Now my partner doesn’t need to be blasted out the room with the high tv volume that I need sometimes I can dispense with subtitles and I can even listen to American films where sometimes a drawling accent makes it impossible to follow.
5,Wanted to transmit sound from my projector 'out' mini-jack connection to my Bluetooth speaker. I'm not very tech-savvy so was worried I wouldn't be able to set it up but it was really easy - make sure you charge it up before you start the process though. Press the Trond 'on' button the your Bluetooth speaker button let them link and all done. Only issue is that my Bluetooth speaker doesn't have the aptX technology that the Trond odes which means that there's a noticeable sound delay between picture and voices. Not the Trond's fault.
5,Gerät funktioniert prima
5,What a great bit of tech I've used it as a bluetooth transmitter from my hi-fi to two different headphones (beats and bluedio r+) perfect. I've also used it to send music from my phone (galaxy s3) to the hi-fi) again perfect. Pairing is easier than most I like that you turn the unit on then double tap to put it into pairing mode simple. So a quick tip as this is a great piece of tech it's 'smart' so if you are using it to transmit from a source with volume control turn the volume up slowly from a low level to a level 'for transmitting' if the sound source is to low (quiet) the unit will think it needs to (quite rightly) go into a 'sleep' mode. Adjust the volume to your liking on your headphones you'll find the transmitted volume more than loud enough to 'pull' it down on the headphones. Enjoy! This is a brilliant bit of tech great gadget. Buy in confidence.
5,I bought this so I could finally listen to my old cds via my old cd player but through my Bluetooth speaker. It has revolutionised my musical life! No more bulky speakers and unsightly wires. I use a sound link mini but I think I need a better quality speaker to match the quality of this little magic device. Easy to use and set up. Great value.
5,What a fantastic product!  I wanted to connect 2 Bluetooth speakers to one source (MP3 Player and Radio) so I could have the same music in the Guest Lounge and the Restaurant at our Guest House without running cables everywhere.This brilliant gadget has solved the problem and I can leave the MP3 on a shelf in the hallway and have brilliant clear simulanious sound in both room.Little bit tricky to pair both devices at first but reading the actually very good instructions and following them to the letter solved that problem!  Still all up and running in less than 15 mins.Highly recommended.
4,Nice piece of equipment. It works well yet not very easy to connect to multiple headphones. The poor manual is to blame for that. The hardware itself seems sound.
5,Used to connect old ipod to Sony bluetooth headphones
5,Used it for a TV. Connected to the TV easily and to my headphone without any issues. The sound quality is really good and if there is any latency I could not feel it. Very happy with such a simple product
4,I recently posted a not so good review for the trond I received in 2016. The seller contacted me & sent me a replacement despite being well out of warranty. Most refreshing. The trond is great works with any device paired with bluetooth headphones. Currently I'm a satisfied customer.
5,Excellent sound quality when used with an old school iPod shuffle.  Used it with a pair of blue tooth earphones while running.  No sound drop out or connection problems.  Plenty of battery life for an hour+ run.  No problems when bouncing around in my shorts pocket when used with the solid connector supplied.  I would recommend these wholeheartedly.
5,At the time of writing this I bought this for basically £20.Audio quality is indistinguishable from using a native Bluetooth transmitter chip such as the one on my phone.No static no latency cuts or disruptive sounds. I am seriously impressed. Quality is spot on.I hope it lasts but so far this is an unbelivable product for the money.
1,Poor quality. Keep disconnecting all the time. Dont waste your money.
4,Family love that TV doesn't have to be up loud
5,Brilliant little device good quality sound and low latency
5,After a bit of trouble setting this up I managed to get it to work. Apart from a very small sound delay the audio is very good and clear. The sound delay is not enough to spoil my TV watching and could probably be because my TV is a few years old.
5,This product is perfect! I am using it for connecting my airpods pros to my laptop. Its was an easy setup and is easy to use. I would definitely recommend!
5,Use this to transmit from my Fiio X3 to my Sony MDR XB950BT head phones and it works faultlessly. Hold the button down for a couple of seconds on the TROND to switch it on then hold down the on button on the headphones for 7 seconds and they pair automatically. I have had no issues with signal drop out and the range seems very good even through walls in my flat.The short wire that comes with the TROND would be better with right angle connectors and I had a spare one of these and this is what I use - not really enough to lose a star though.Also I have tried watching movies with this and while it works okay the speech is slightly out of sink; however I bought this to use with my Fiio X3 for music and for this I can't fault it - hence 5 stars.
1,Was 5 stars now downgraded to 1.I wanted a Bluetooth device to add to my Avtex TV so that it would connect to our Kenwood sound system in our Motorhome. So pleased this worked as I wasn't sure it would after another brand would not connect and had to be returned.This was super easy to connect the sound is fabulous I haven't noticed any delay in lipsink which I understand could be a problem with all Bluetooth devices. So pleased we can now use our sound system.To add to my review this only worked 3 times now it will not connect and we are away for 5 weeks in Europe so can't return it.No info to contact seller to ask for help and to ask to send another. Very very very disappointed. Don't waste your money.
2,After  6 weeks would only pair now and again. Had frequent problems trying to get TV paired with headphones. Headphones pair ok with my ipad. Replaced Trond transmitter with a Avantree Audicast plus  which works perfectly and pairs immediately every time. Wouldn't buyTrond again
5,Great little device. I use the Budd earphones and was going through quite a lot working outside. They would catch on plants and pull out of my phone. With this I put it in my hat with the wires coming down to my ears. I also use it at home and charge it at the same time. Most Bluetooth headsets turn off when the charger is plugged in. Only thing I will say is don't put it in the washing machine I am ordering a new one today.
5,You get what you pay for and this item is spot on
5,Absolutely brilliant!!.. I wanted to be able to listen to the TV through headphones as not to disturb the wife.. the sound bar would not Bluetooth to the headphones so last hope was to buy this must have the most simplistic set up..press the button on the unit press the headphones and it joined instantly... could not sound better simpler or function better..
4,This is a good product and i use it for many things. I would have rated it 5 stars but if you use it while its charging it makes a light buzz noise. Would recommend.
4,The set-up was simple and the design is nice. I have connected it to the tv to transmit to bluetooth headset. I first tried to connect to the 3.5mm out + the USB for continuous charging. However that led to intermittent sound noise and weak electric shocks upon touching the device. After disconnecting the USB it works well using both the 3.5mm out or the red/white phono out. Conclusion is that it does not work well to charge while using the device (the manual also warns that this may shorten the battery life).
5,I bought this to give Bluetooth audio from a flat screen TV that has very tinny speakers.  I was concerned about possible sync problems between picture and sound but they work well together.  I have also used it to receive Bluetooth and that works well too.  I paired it to both the TV (as a transmitter) and the radio (as a receiver) without any problems - didn't even refer to the instructions.Amazed at how small it is - think of an After Eight Mint - but just a little bit thicker and a little bit smaller length and width.One worry is that it's so small I may put it down and forget where it is and as it's so small it'll be hard to find!Good value too.
5,I was surprised at how small the unit was. Everything was very easy to set up.  I use it to broadcast my CDs and vinyl albums to my bluetooth headphones.  Sound quality is excellent I now know exactly how scratched some of my old albums are.  I haven't used the unit to receive audio from another source so I can't comment on that funtionality. Very happy with my purchase does exactly what I expected it to to a very high standard.
1,Le retard de transmission est énorme la qualité du son... Oula l'horreur !Ça grésille en permanence même sans aucun son et chaque basse est transformée en calvaire auditif.
4,Just set up with Trond headhhones. Easy enough and works well.
3,Pros:- I have only used the Trond 2-in-1 as a receiver buy found it easy to install and use.- The bluetooth connection can be maintained for quite a distance and even through some walls.Cons:- The battery life is quite short and I wish the device had a standby mode it would enter if left idle for 30 minutes or so. Instead it just drains the battery if you have forgotten to switch it off.- I wish it was possible to lower the volume of its prompts and warning signals. If it is about run out of power it sends a loud warning signal - much louder than the music or podcast that I am listening to. When using it with in-ear headphones that signal is painfully loud and startles me every time. Very annoying. I wish there was some way to lower that warning signal.
2,Se emparejó rápidamente con mis auriculares. A tres metros tiene pérdidas de señal de forma continuada.
4,This tiny gadget has turned my old Denon amplifier into a Bluetooth enabled machine with no fuss whatsoever. I simply set it as a receiver plugged it in to the amplifier with the cables provided paired it to my iPad without any problems and was able to play music from my iPad through my full sound system via Bluetooth. It worked equally as well when set as a transmitter allowing me to listen to my DAB radio via my wireless Bluetooth headphones to which it paired with no fuss.
5,Does exactly what it says on the tin.Have been through 3 different adapters trying to achieve the sub 40ms delay of aptx low latency. These where the first that acctually managed it despite the others also being (petentially falsely) advertised as low latency devices.Tested these with Pro audio equipment sending music across rooms with less than 40ms latency! Brilliant.Audio quality is the same as a wire to my ear.If your looking for a device to play audio in sync with video please make absolutely sure the other bt item in your signal chain officially supports aptx low latency.Cheers!
3,There is noticeable latency which is on the edge of bareable if watching tv only useful as a receiver really due to this.
5,Work really well and gives excellent sound quality.
3,Wasn’t too happy with the sound quality once I connected two speakers together. I have nice quality Sony and Marshall speakers and the bass just vanished once I connected them sounded like they were played through tin cans a little disappointed.
5,Chose this as a good gadget for providing a bluetooth connection for my TV as I wanted to use wireless headphones with a standard tv. Good value easy to connect and pair with some existing wireless earphones I had. Had a minor issue for which I contacted Trond Support. They were great - prompt efficient support and the matter resolved quickly. I did also purchase the Trond low latency wireless headphones to go with the transmitted and that made the experience even better.
5,I am old and hard of hearing in one ear with Tinnitus in the other. I have two types of RF headphones to help while I am watching TV but everything still sounds rather "muffled" to me;  I thought that I would venture down the route of bluetooth. I was slightly concerned over speech sync and treble fall off but using this item as a receiver together with it's slightly larger brother (a Trond Duo BT transmitter connected via Toslink to the TV)  I am in a new world !!  While watching the Politics show this morning and using my Sure 535 earbuds it was as if I were in the TV studio with the guests in fact clearer to me than real life.I can thoroughly recommend the set up to anyone thank you Trond.
5,I like the small simple design .  It can be connected to a device with either the short 3.5mm male to male audio cable or the solid 3.5mm male to male audio connector supplied.  It works perfectly with my iPod Classic and a Bluetooth speaker.  The rechargeable battery can last up to approximtely 10 hours.
5,I bought this transmitter as I couldn’t fix a problem with the my bluetooth headphones randomly and frequently  disconnecting from my laptop during video conference calls. This device was easy to set up and I had it working in a couple of minutes. Also tried it on my TV and it works a treat.
2,Purchased this to use with the Nintendo switch. In short it works so you can hear via a Bluetooth gaming headset however the microphone function does not work.Detailed reviewPlugged in to the switch headphone jack exactly as I plug in my wired gaming headset. Connected quickly and I could hear sound from the Bluetooth gaming headset. The problem however came when trying to chat on fortnite. The microphone did not work at all the other issue I ran into was that when the Bluetooth adapter was plugged into the switch USB port to charge there was a loud buzzing noise coming into the headset which means you cannot use this while charging it either. Shame really because it paired quickly and was very straight forward however it did not work as intended.
5,Bought this item together with Soundpeats Q12 earbuds - both have low latency feature to allow independent listening of the TV. Very easy to set up. Initially I had a buzzing sound and contacted Tron who replied very quickly that my problem was due to me plugging phono into the TV together with the USB into the TV. This causes a feedback thus giving me the buzzing. By plugging the USB into a wall socket eliminated this. Now have perfect sound and given the low latency the sound is in sync with the picture. Highly rated piece of kit and first class backup service from Tron.
5,Got this to use 2 pairs of Headphones at the same time & it does it perfectly with music I think you may get a tiny  bit of Latency with a game console though that said I am VERY PLEASED.....good over distance at least 25 feet through 2 brick walls ( Wife in the garden me indoors )
5,What a great little thing this is. Pairs effortlessly with my iPod Classic to Bluetooth speaker. Turned one of my old iLuv CD Speaker into a Turns all your equipment to Bluetooth with very little fuss.Wires and I were created to be tangled up in each other or tripped over. Now that's over.My iPod Classic now pairs instantly with my Bluetooth headphones as does everything else.I bought a couple of these and plugged them into everything I could and so far everything pairs and works fantastically.This little gadget is a transmitter and receiver:Plugged one into my iPod classic and connected immediately with my Bluetooth Kitsound speaker (did this with the TV Sky Box and Blu Ray Player and all now play via the Bluetooth speaker).
4,Wasnt sure about this item but its tiny and easy to use with a little patience it's easy to set up too. Works a treat and saved me having to buy a whole new bluetooth compatible cd player
5,I purchased this device to stream sound during video playback on a Laptop to Bose q35 headphones. The connection was good and sound quality fine but unfortunately Bose Q35 does not support the low latency codec and there was a lag between the sound and video leading to a lip sync delay. The TROND device has been let down by the very expensive Bose product which is why Trond suggest their own headphones! Too late to return the Bose so I returned this device!!
5,This transmitter has enable me to listen to the radio on my blue-tooth earphones.  I also plan to use it to listen to the tv via the headphones as well.  It was easy to set up and I was listening to the radio in no time at all.
4,Does what is says on the box so far seems excellent.
5,Excellent does exactly what is needed easy to install if your looking for a Bluetooth receiver/ transmitter I would be happy to recommend this model.
1,In theory and based on reviews this was due to work well. Installation was straight forward but there is a significant lag in the video + audio. I would not recommend. And word to the wise do not miss your return window otherwise you are out 30 GBP on something that will go into the bin.
4,Istruzioni solo in inglese ma abbastanza intuitive.Cavo rca estremamente corto ne avevo uno un po' più lungo e l'ho sostituito.Ritardo impercettibile così come il rumore di fondo bisogna impegnarsi per notarlo. Più che accettabile.A volume basso esclude molti suoni (sostituiti da silenzio) ed è molto fastidioso bisogna aumentare il volume per sentire tutto senza interruzioni.Ho avuto qualche problema dopo aver installato una soundbar anch'essa collegata tramite bluetooth non si associava più alle cuffie ma poi è bastato tenere premuto (l'unico) pulsante per altri 3 secondi dopo lo spegnimento per effettuare un reset del dispositivo dopodiché ha ripreso a funzionare perfettamente.Mai provato in modalità RX.
3,Bought this to transmit bluetooth to my headphones as it stated low delay/latency. It did transmit well and paired very easily with headphones unfortunately its latency was still too slow to use with an electronic instrument. I think this should be stated in the product description. It works exceptionally well with music and there is only a very slight delay in TV transmission but a massive delay if you want to use it with an electric guitar or drum kit (as I wanted to as fed up with getting sticks tangled with headphone cable). I don't know if a wireless set up that would work with headphones and a drum kit actually exists? For the time being gone back to a very long headphone jack cable that runs down my back!
4,Great value easy to use.
2,The TV recognises it but it id the only machine that does.
5,I use this with an Anker speaker and TV with no lag with sound. (I tried to use my echo dot but it isn't sophisticated enough and had a massive lag). Battery life is decent and it's very small so would happily take it traveling.
5,I bought it for using in the car where I have it connected to a kindle tablet for music. Works well makes a rising beep noise when connected and falling beep noise when disconnecting. Being able to charge whilst also playing music is also a bonus. Doesn't take calls when using it with the phone think this is common across most Bluetooth receivers but not sure why. Only ever used to receive music.I would say after 2 months use it is a good buy if you are considering getting one for your car. There a million to chose from on Amazon and this one isn't cheapest but it works has a small size and looks good in the car.
4,Hab das Gerät gekauft um von meinem Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Musik auf meine dockingstation die kein Bluetooth hat zu schicken. Die Bluetooth Verbindung ist top. Das einzige was mich etwas stört ist das klinke auf klinke Kabel. Es sizt  sehr locker. Ich habe den Transmitter Modus an meinem Note 4  benuzt. Ich habe das mitgelieferte Klinken Kabel an die klinkenbuchse meines Note 4 angesteckt und habe festgestellt das das Kabel von Kopfhörer im Vergleich viel besser sizt.  Dies ist aber der einzige Kritikpunkt mit dem lockeren klinkenkabel aber kein Mangel an der Funktion.
5,A very very simple and effective device. It's tiny - which worried me a bit. But it does *exactly* what you would expect - power it up via USB pair it with your Bluetooth headphones plug it into an audio source - and you are done!
2,iPhone on max volume and jack output from Trond is too low level ….at least 6dB or half volume down .. this means you need to turn the volume up high on the downstream speaker /amp = noise and a shock when you switch back to normal level from another source ..
5,This is a great little device. I was able to transmit from my phone to this that was connected to a high volume PA without any lag or drop off. I was surprised how far I was able to transmit the signal well over 20 meters but manly operating around 10 - 15 meters. I haven't tried this as a transmitter but I imagine that will work just as well.
1,I bought this to use with my TV however I had the most frustrating experience with this product and the one that the company sent me as a replacement. At first there was a problem with the low sound as it would disappear or cut out of nothing. It’s really annoying. After that I had the problem about turning it on or off.... difficulty in pairing with any earphones I have... after trying many times... the product would connect but then the sound would be terrible full of noises. I had to turn off and then turn on again so it would work better. But then as I said... It is so hard to do that! I had the same problems with both versions of this product! Definitely not worthy. I can only tell you that the customer service is pretty good though. I will keep looking for another one as I really need this in my daily routine.
3,Decent item connects well and quickly but so far I've had to charge it a bit more than I would have expected which is very annoying when it stops working when you're in the middle of something!
5,Thought I’d try this as an experiment to get Bluetooth onto my TV so I could use earphones to compensate for my increased hard of hearing. Working a treat and I can hear audio perfectly. Very reasonable price and easy to setup.
5,Excellent product... small and compact.
3,I used this device with a LG 4k tv.And with jaybird and Samsung bluetooth headphones.But the device keeps lagging behind by a second and still not able to sync it up so it's not lagging.
4,Much better than one I had previously.  Clearnohissing or crackling. I like it
5,Overall pleased with the product however there is latency and therefore a delay between the device and what’s coming though the Bluetooth device... I would imagine this would be the same for most. This would be really noticeable if you are syncing video with audio...
5,Brilliant! Plugged it inturned it onand connected cable to my ipod classic and BINGO! 2000+ songs available  on my bluetooth earbuds couldn't be simpler even for a techno numpty like me! The unit is very small and discreetit transmits flawlessly all over our house even through multiple walls.Simply cannot fault this little bluetooth unit. VERY pleased indeed that my ipod classic has joined the 21st century. 5 stars.
5,So simple and easy to work
5,Einfache Installation
4,I desperately wanted to listen to lectures and presentations without annoying my family! Marantz customer services pointed me in the right direction and this little Bluetooth module works a treat! It can be set to transmit or receive; and after initial charging of four hours it paired easily with my new earphones.Now I can wander around the house listening to my recordings without annoying anyone. Brilliant!
4,Handy unit does as it says on box
5,Excellent device. I use it to link my guitar/pc interface output to my Trond bluetooth headphones. Low latency gives faultless sound. No headphone cable to get tangled up in the guitar headstock.
5,Simple to set up worked first time .
5,Higly recommended!I bought a cheaper one off amazon several quid cheaper but awful quality and with a lot of interference. Returned ordered this - AMAZING! Well built well packaged works great allowing my bluetooth headphones to connect to non bluetooth device. Thanks.
5,Arrived next day.....hooked it up to Hantseng F18 mp3 player and two rocpod ( boompods )speakers ..now have a brilliant tiny portable music system to blast a beat out when running with a group of friendsNot sure yet how long the battery will hold out but have ordered a power pack just in caseDelighted so far 😊 only one star for tech support as I asked them several days ago if this would work and heard nothing from them
5,It is incredibly small but built amazingly well and is easy to use.
4,Pretty good for the £
5,I originally had an Avantree transmitter that I could never get to work properly. Eventually it stopped working properly completely so I got a refund and got the Trond from Amazon instead. What a difference! Whereas I could never get a clear process to link devices in the past it is now so easy. I switch on the headphones and then the transmitter and the two link up. With the Avantree if I wandered into my kitchen the signal started breaking up: with the Trond it is far far better. The device itself is very small but smart and feels robust. I am very happy with it so far....
4,Using Trond device to enable me to listen to DAB radio in bed without waking anyone else up.Working well connected to my Beats Earphones
4,Works well with one major flaw --- it has no auto sleep. I cannot keep it permanently plugged in and I do not want to have to turn it off all the time so it runs out of battery... If it went to sleep automatically or in too low power mode it would have been so much better.
5,Sehr guter Empfang preis Leistung passt
5,Arrived a day earlier than expected so great. Needed to charge f or two hours straight out of box. A choice of connection leads in the box. Charged connected to tv turned on and found headphones immediately. Great sound no lag as yet. Great price. Allows me to watch 📺without my husband moaning! 👍😜
5,Easy to set up and connect to use my (old but very good) mp3 player through an Anker Bluetooth speaker.  Only hitch was I'd forgotten the Bluetooth on my phone was turned on and the sender kept connecting with it first - eventually realised this and turned it off.  Very simple to use after that!
1,Worked okay for a few months (sound quality was a bit lame but this is a cheap device) then just stopped charging.  I guess the internal battery is cheap rubbish.  Don't waste your money on this - far better devices out there (as I have not discovered)!!!
5,Good value. Good price.
3,Si no fuera por las interferencias de ruido recurrentes le daría más estrellas (durante la carga usb causa un zumbido molesto).  Tiene una duración de batería decente pero no hay forma de saber cuánta batería queda.  No dura tanto como se anuncia.  Por el precio es aceptable pero no notable.
5,I Purchased this product to allow me to play an electric guitar thro Sennheiser 450BT Bluetooth headphones works a treat with no detectable latency.Just plugged  it into the amplifier using the supplied instructions.Well pleased
5,And it works on the Nintendo Switch while it's docked.Yet to assess the sound quality etc.
5,Das Gerät funktioniert einwandfrei undist klein passt überall. TOP
5,I had a problem with the original Trond transmitter I bought - it just would not transmit further than 3 mts. Once I contacted Trond Bruce - their Customer Care  person - went out of the way to send a replacement and make sure I was happy with it. The replacement works perfectly and the review reflects this. Wish all companies were as goos as this with after sales and customer care.
5,The first device I received had poor quality sound I suspect this had already been returned and reissued by Amazon. Trond customer service immediately arranged for a replacement which works perfectly connection was easy and sound quality excellent.
5,This product meets all the claims/info that I found on line it was straight forward to pair with my Hi-Fi and gives great performance with my headphones through out the house and well in to the garden. Due to some hearing issues I am now thinking of adding a transmitter to my TV and if so it will definitely be a TRONDHIGHLY RECOMMENDED
1,There's a half second delay from Bluetooth making it difficult to play my guitar total waste of money
5,Very good quality product. The sound is great when used as receiver. You can use it to listen music with your favorite wired headphones with great results. I bought this item to use it to monitor my sound quality during I produce my videos. Until now I used wired headphones and many times I forgot I have the headphones around my neck and often when I go away from the camera I shock up it because of short length of the wire. Now I'm free to move without fears. I find this item very useful. The battery is powerful enough to used it 5-6 hours.
5,I use this little Trond device in my 2007 car via the aux port. It works brilliantly. I now have my music and radio shows on the go I get traffic updates and I can still use the car phone system (via the ancient BLE already installed). I’m impressed.
5,Easy and consistently pairing is a relief!The sound quality is good though there's quite bad latency for 'live' use albeit synchronising for watching TV/movies is good.It also works well for either broadcast or receive.
4,Works well with headphones. Sound quality very good. When used with the tv it gives a small delay so lip sinc isn’t always perfect but good enough.
5,Very dinky.  Much smaller than expected.  I have it attached to 3.5 audio socket on a TV and it works well.  I leave it on permanently and connect it to the power daily to charge until the red light goes out.  If I turn it off it takes a little longer to connect to the speaker.
5,Really excellent little device that has enabled me to have seam!ess music through the house. Easy to follow clear instructions. The one query I had was answered very promptly by the highly professional Tron customer service team. I would recommend this device to anyone wishing to use more than one Bluetooth speaker. Easily hidden away due to its small size. It works best if you use two identical speakers. That way you avoid any slight audio delays and differences between the two. I am 100% pleased with this product.
4,Very good for TV headphone input. Sound is good for Bluetooth but battery only last's about 8 hours.
5,Easy to install/connect great product
4,Bought this to connect an old CD system to my Alexa Echo.  Easily paired with the Echo and works perfectly.
4,TV sound.  Much better than previous attempts but still a tiny amount of echo it seems earphones were only aptx and not also low latency.  Still good enough for now
2,It's ok not the best signal and the sound gets distorted if you ramp up the volume . At lower sound it's quite adequate and was easy to set up.I used it to connect a samsung tv to skull candy noise cancelling wireless headset.  Stay safe everyone.
5,This is a discrete unobtrusive and well made bit of kit.  Very easy to use and pairs with my headphones instantly. I only use this device as a transmitter and can hear no difference between using my headphones with bluetooth or using a wired connection. Range is good: I get good reception at 12m and through three solid brick walls.
5,So simple to use and works wonderfully. I had been looking for a similar device for quite some time andmy search led me to the best model available. It is great to listen to music from equipment that doesnot include built-in Bluetooth facilities! There is absolutely no loss in the sound level - as promised inthe relevant advertisement. Therefore I highly recommend the purchase of this article to persons whoseek good quality simplicity and an undoubtedly convenient deal. Furthermore the seller provides excellent/caring assistance to the respective clients. Definitely a superlative experience!
2,I bought one to hopefully connect two of very small Bluetooth speakers that I bought from amazon(partyStarter brand) its not worked when worked it disconnects a lot while only has less than a meter distance from transmitter :( Also sometimes sound come out with latency from one of speakers :( it destroy the music feeling experience :( once its hanged while plying and stayed in red for one day no button operates wait oe day they it start working but they same happen :( I think its from speakers I change speakers but same result happen. I understand its from transmitter. I returned in excellent condition hopefully they refund me. :) I'm looking to buy product that works with two or more speakers supported with crystal clear sound output.
4,Good product - easy to setup and use. Connected my Sony TV to Apple Airpods with no problem and they auto connect once paired. Best way to ensure easy pairing is to make sure no other devices to which the earphones are connected are in the vicinity/turned off.
5,Really good little piece of kit. It has worked well with my ancient iPod allowing me to connect it to a Bluetooth speaker. NB it comes with several connections so don't buy a aux lead until you've seen what's in the box.
5,Nice compact size and very simple to set up. I have Trond earphones which provide excellent sound. The price is excellent. I would recommend this Bluetooth v5.0 transmitter.
4,Good
3,this was a replacement for one that broke after a few weeks
5,This is a great device BUT I must echo the words of previous reviewer George Robinson. You *won't* be able to create a low latency link using two of these one transmitting the other receiving - if you want to replace the cable to your guitar microphone whatever the latency here is too high - the echo delay is a quarter of a second which is the equivalent of the echo from a cliff wall 40 metres away. I wondered if his review preceded the updated capabilities of the device but no!
5,Bought this to connect to Bluetooth earphones but also connected to my music centre to sound bars great sound and less wires and speakers 👍
1,J'aurais dû lire les commentaire avant la qualité audio est vraiment nul. Le son quand il y en à est très mauvais il y a en permanence un souffle dans les écouteur.
5,good quality
5,Bluetooth that works both ways.Allows you to turn an old style Hi-Fi in to a bluetooth compatible one.Also allows you to make an older style device or TV work with bluetooth enabled speakers.Highly recommended.
5,I’ve only been using this so that I can use my wired headphones wirelessly with my smartphone since my new phone is an iPhone 8 and no longer has a headphone jack. I’m pleased to say that the device works perfectly with good quality sound and a good wireless range. Very easy to setup and is a must have for anyone in my situation.
5,Bought this bluetooth transmitter /receiver with a view to connect two sets of bluetooth headphones at the same time to a projector to watch films in the garden without disturbing others in the neighbourhood!It works wonderfully absolutely delighted. Would recommend.
5,Cant really rate this as returned didn’t connect to my equipment ? ( maybe it was mine)  The quality was vey good
4,I've only used the device a few times. It pairs fairly easily and indeed works with 2 sets of headphones and the sound quality is very good. However I have had to pair it a second time when using it on a third occasion.
5,Great works well worth buying
5,Great little device with top notch sound quality. Paired with Scullcandy Uproar headphones for tv use. Superb. Highly recommended. R.
1,Have an LED Samsung TV 9 years old and linked the device to a "King" bluetooth sound bar to get better sound. It works BUT there is a sync problem a delay of about half second with the lip sync on the picture. Tried everything but still the problem. Volume is a bit low. Due to carriage in EU to UK it is not worth sending it back. it will be ok I suppose just for sound without a picture. Not happy with it as it does not do what I want would not recommend waste of money.
3,This product pairs quickly with other devices and I have had no problems with lipsync with low latency devices. The sound quality through my Sennheiser headphones is very good. It only gets 3 stars because  the battery is too small and it only runs for a couple of hours before giving an ear splitting series of low battery warnings. It could easily be twice the size to accommodate a bigger battery.
5,Neat little device that connects to the preamp output of my old amplifier.  Very easy to set up and works seamlessly with Nobosound mini Bluetooth preamplifier to make my old music system fully bluetoothed.
4,Works well enough over short distances in line of sight. I found the range to be similar to most mini Bluetooth dongles (Class 2)-obviously this could vary according to the sensitivity/power of sending/receiving devices. Easy to connect and supplied with the necessary cables.
4,This is a good little gadget slightly let down by short battery life. Sound quality is very good and the headphone amp is surprisingly powerful. I have only used it as a receiver however. I would have given 4.5 stars if possible.
4,Bluetooth is not perfect for high sound quality but for connecting headphones to the TV then it just has to work. The transmitter connects with my Plantronics Backbeat Sense without any problems and there is no latency issues.
5,Got this to connect to my Bose headphones to my Bose wave SoundTouch but it will not tried several times but no luck
2,Sound lag from a device only 2 meters away buying an aux cable in future the standard lag if you don't have a X... somthing or other compatible speaker is not good enough for viewing TV shows ect. Lip sync is very noticeable for £22 its terrible i would expect that for a £10 device...maybe
5,I have used BT receivers before to connect my phone to my stereo system but this time I needed a transmitter as well. I am using two devices one as transmitter and one as receiver to make a wireless connection between the control amplifier and the power amplifier/speakers. They work very well and I have no problems setting them up. A great product and reasonably priced.
5,The sellers of this product want you to be happy with your purchase and will go out of their way to help you set it up. I received an email before the transmitter/receiver had even arrived detailing everything I needed to know.  As it happens I did have a problem but it turned out to be my headphones that were at fault. Once I had reset them everything worked perfectly. So I'm very happy with the Trond transmitter.
5,Purchased the Trond BT Duo so i could play my turntable (with pre amp) through my Panasonic sound bar the set up is very easy and works excellent i did have an issue with pairing to start with so i contacted Trond and they responded very quickly and sorted the problem it was  me not reading the sound bar instructions.I would highly recommend the Trond BT DUO and their customer service.
4,Bought this to link a Bose sound link to our Sony smart tv that does not have Bluetooth. Result was perfect. Thanks.
5,Does what it's supposed to.Note: aptX works only if 1 device is connected not 2.
5,All aspects of unit are excellent used for remote listening to TV.
5,Came v quickly in post box. Item came with full instructions and various cables plus useful dongle. Small sleek and smooth in design with good on/off button. I bought for my LG TV and with the direction of the LG software easy easy to use and enjoy. Just ensure you have either a Headphone or Phono OUT on TV. I like this device.
5,Works great with my Bluetooth speaker paired straight away took a bit longer with my lindy headphones but once paired works straight away.
5,all good
5,The sound quality is VERY good. The unit is compact and sleek. There is a small delay but very small... and there is no clip so you need to keep this in the pocket.
5,This is fantastic so easy to setup and the sound quality is brilliant. Only issue is battery life isn't that good but I can just charger it via tv while using it
4,Great bluetooth having easy swtch for tx or rx. Bought for good latency features but lag time still too slow for use with bluetooth headphones and electric piano keyboard (trying to have no wires to hinder playing).
5,Prompt delivery.  Used this mainly for use with blue tooth headphones and an older tv. This device works well and I have not experienced any latency when watching tv.
5,I bought this to watch TV in the bedroom at night with headphones. It works well and I am happy. Connects very easy with the device you need it to pair to.
1,Poor conectivity & not the easiest to setup; sound drops in/out at a distance of 6ft ... worth £7.99 not ~ £30
5,I bought one of these and the audio quality as receiver didn’t live up to good reviews. Thought it was faulty so returned it and ordered another. Same issue again so I returned it and gave up. Trond customer service reached out to me explaining the issue and sent me out a new one which is perfect. Great audio quality as receiver in car from phone
5,Great little gadget good range and sound quality and paired very easily and quickly with my sony headphones
4,Great bit of kit - easy to set up and with both tx/Rx means it works as well with tv headphones as it does with sound docks
1,I have an expensive set of headphones that support aptx so I thought that would be good enough but it wasn't the delay was terrible this is the reason why from trond UK hope it is helpful Please be informed that aptX and aptX Low Latency is two different features offered by the premium Bluetooth chipset maker - CSR. AptX can offer high-quality CD-like audio quality whereas aptX LL will reduce the latency to about 30-40ms.More important it also depends on what codec your paired Bluetooth headphones or speaker may support. If your BT device supports aptX LL the latency would be about 30-40ms. If it doesn't the codec of TROND BT-DUO will be downgraded to aptX with the latency of 60-80ms; if aptx is not supported the codec of TROND BT-DUO will be further downgraded to SBC with the latency of 170-270ms.
5,Main reason I bought it was to connect airpod pros to the in flight entertainment for a long haul flight. it did this perfectly with battery life that outlasts the airpods. Also works to connect airpods to a PS4 controller.
5,absolutely thrilled with this product. it has enabled me to listen to my old mp3s  on my new bose portable speaker and the sound quality is fantastic. many thanks. Michael Cowan
1,Ich habe alles versucht konnte aber keine Verbindung herstellen.Geht wieder zurück.
4,Used only as a transmitter. Only very slight delay. Not really noticeable if you weren't looking for it. May vary according to receiver's ability to process.
2,used this with an old ipod was hoping it would work good for motorcycle use but alas pretty useless. Sound is not good. Will use again in an effort to see if its user error but am not hopeful. My ipod is one of the originals so maybe thats an issue.
5,both items good quality working well
5,Excellent item & quality. A Must-Have.Low latency/portability/can be either receiver or transmitter are the best features this device provides.The item integrates a non-removable rechargeable battery.The pack includes all kinds of adapters one could need (RCA to Female mini Jack USB to USB Micro for charging or keeping connected for power Mini Jack to Mini Jack Adapter Mini Jack to Mini Jack Cable)
3,Collegato alla TV si connette (quasi) subito alle mie cuffie bluetooth (Plantronics backbeat sense - con aptx -). Purtroppo non memorizza i dispositivi associati in precedenza e bisogna fare ogni volta il pairing. E' presente una latenza per fortuna non eccessiva. Per ora la durata della batteria va bene e in generale posso dirmi abbastanza soddisfatto. Casualmente ho visto poi che esiste un dispositivo aggiornato della stessa marca (Trond bt duo S)..solitamente amazon lo indica ma non questa volta..ed è un peccato perché ovviamente avrei comprato il dispositivo migliorato (più o meno allo stesso prezzo)
5,Neat little device that worked first time I plugged it into the TV. The audio quality is not amazing but I use it with Apple AirPods. I leave the USB charger connected to the TV so it runs off the USB power 24/7.
5,I bought this and a MPow one at the same time. This one is the only one that has had no issues transmitting audio. Also has good range and the battery has lasted well for my purposes.
5,Very pleased bought with Trond tv transmitter and headphones which worked straight virtually out of box. Tried these with non Bluetooth headphones connected to a Samsung Tab A tablet once they had connected worked a treat. Cannot discuss sound quality as it was just a podcast with no music.  Would recommend specially at this price. Delivery very good too.
5,This is a superb product. Works great both as a transmitter and receiver. I have just bought a second one one set to RX for playing Spotify from my iPhone wirelessly through a non-bluetooth hi fi system and the other set to RT to carry on trips and listen to iPlayer downloads on iPad through two sets of bluetooth headphones. Follow the instructions carefully first time then it's a breeze each time thereafter.
2,I had really high hopes for this Trond bluetooth adapter. I bought it in order to connect Bluetooth headphones to my TV as it had the Aptx Low latency codec to match my headphones. Perfect I thought. I connected the Trond and my headphones perfectly the first time and all was good. But alas that was it. The Trond adapter would not connect again. After days of trying and emails to the helpful 'support at Trond' I gave up and returned the item to Amazon . Maybe I was just unlucky.  I have now purchased an alternative from Amazon and all is very good.
5,Easy use.
5,Very easy to set up with my Bluetooth headphones. Sound quality is great.
5,Perfect in every way
5,Utilisé en émetteur et testé sur le port audio d'un baladeur et d'un PC la portée est d'environ 5 mètres lorsqu'il y a un mur en agglo et d'une dizaine de mètres en champ libre. Convient parfaitement à mon utilisation. Cette version 4.1 de Bluetooth sans qu'elle soit la dernière permet d'exploiter sans difficulté la qualité audio du casque sans fil BluedioT3 plus que j'ai acheté par ailleurs.
5,But beware there is a 40ms delay from the input to Bluetooth
4,Generally works quite well while in line of sight but not so good when there are obstacles (like walls) in the way. Pretty easy to set up and use.
1,Ich habe dieses Produkt gekauft weil es am schnellsten geliefert wird und man zwei bluethooth Lautsprecher verbinden kann. Die ersten 10 Sekunden war alles synchron doch dann spielte die Musik immer weiter auseinander. Selbst ein Stern ist zu gut für diesen Transmitter
1,Horrible sound. After connecting it to my stereo system and my wireless Bose headphones the sound is horrible and too low.I will use an extension audio cable instead since this is clearly NOT an option! Don't buy it.
5,Brilliant! Now my partner and I can watch TV together and both be happy with the sound...one of us no longer deafens the other!  The company sent a really helpful email with a step-by-step guide on how to set it up.  Well it was extremely easy for me as my partner set it up.  But he didn't turn the air blue so I presume it was easy.
1,Just didn’t wort on tv to connect ear buds 😟
5,I didnt expect this to be as good and handy as it is to me.And love the transfer quality.5/5 from me
4,Seems to work well
5,just can't fault it great little unit
5,The good reviews are well justified I had problems with speech lag on the tv but I contacted Trond who were exceptionally helpful advised me as to the best spec earbuds to pair with the bt adapter I found a suitable pair and it all works well
2,The product packing and quality is good but the sound was not at all good. There was a constant shrill sound coming in both the headphones.
5,Very good. A little bit of latency.
1,It connected to my headphones but not to the Tv. I’m not great at this stuff so that could be my fault. But they didn’t reply to my phone call or email asking for help so I’m sending it back
5,Can play my iPod and have my phone at the same time
5,Works well with the headset.
5,Excellent quality.
5,sound quality good range very good
5,Absolutely brilliant..nice and compact easy to use..but the best thing about this product is the customer service you get from them awesome...you only have to email them if you have a question and they get back to promptly plus they check back with you to make sure your ok...what more could you ask from a company
5,A really nice piece of kit  great range and sound quality
5,What a great bit of kitand really smallbought this with a pair of bluedio Bluetooth headphones for watching TVeasy to pair withhave mine plugged into a USB port on the tv (to charge) and plugged into the headphone socket the reception is greathave found I can walk around the whole house with no loss of sound.Would definitely recommend if your like me and don't like clutter.
5,Facile da configurare. Occorre solo tener presente che non decodifica il segnale Dolby pertanto occorre impostare l'audio del TV (o del decoder SKY) su "stereo" e poi selezionare "cuffie" o similmente in relazione al TV posseduto. L'ho capito cercando su internet il manualetto (in inglese) non lo spiega
4,Door de TROND aan te sluiten op de koptelefoonuitgang kunnen kunnen we ook nu ook onze televisie verbinden met een bluetooth koptelefoon. Super!
5,A great little bit of kit. Our RUARK internet radio did not have the facility to transmit onwards to a wireless speaker - the TROND fills that gap perfectly.
5,I have a 1st generation iPod which has no Bluetooth facility but 1800 records on it which I could only listen to through earphones. Now thanks to this tiny excellent gadget I can listen to my music on a wireless speaker. What a wonderful product! I was a little doubtful before purchasing it but my worries were unfounded. I would recommend is to anyone.
5,Excellent product had been looking for a bluetooth transmitter to connect AKG wireless headphones to Denon Amp after trying 5 others this one worked
1,appairage impossible avec casque sony WF1000M4 et WX100M4 inutilisable
5,This little beauty is working perfectly. I use it to receive from my phone & is wired to my speakers. Connects & playing within 10 secs every time. Very happy
5,This product was exactly what i was looking for i can now play music from my mp3 player via bluetooth through my hifi system.
5,Easy to set up.
5,Brilliant little device which plugs into the headphone socket of my amp and transmits to a Bluetooth speaker making my conventional hi fi  instantly multi-room. Very easy to set up.
5,Very simple to set up and connect to my headphones.  Syncs with my iPad and TV quickly. Very happy with my purchase.
5,Working well
5,"Item arrived on time...Got an email from seller explaining how to set it up and use it.Nice touch indeed.. Highly recommended seller."Was pleasantly surprised just how small and neat it is.I use it to transmit sound from my metal detector to my trond bluetooth headphones and it works a treat for me.
5,A small unobtrusive device good quality
4,quite good. Some of the newer Trond devices are better - check them out first BTDuoS is great!
5,"What impressed me most about this product is the email from the seller giving clear instructions on how to use it trouble shooting etc. The product itself is excellent it does exactly as required. My old MP3 player is now Bluetooth thanks to this device. The device is small and keeps excellent charge."
5,Very pleased with my purchase. Have purchased eTROND products before they are reliable and a great price. Will continue to only use eTROND products as they work I am one satisfied customer.
5,Easy to set up using the Trond headphones paired straight away with no problems. There is no discernible lag between sound and picture. I've been using it now for just over 1 month and I'm really pleased with the comfort ease of use and quality of sound reproduction. I'd definitely recommend it!
4,Works really well. A short phase lag before connecting but thereafter brilliant. Build quality is great - no faults.
5,An excellent product. Worked both as a transmitter and receiver without any problems. Did the job I wanted it for and I might even buy another to use with my old hi-fi system.
5,Used these to plug into my Xbox one joystick so I could transmit the audio to my external Bluetooth speakers. Worked great.
5,Very well made and practical product for upgrade without discard what you have at home.
5,Volume. It also has to be retuned to the headphone every time you switch on.
5,Does what it is intended for.
5,Works very well; have had this for some months now just press and hold the on button until the led comes on then it turns from blue to red and vise verses until connected to your headphones and a simple press of the button to switch off.
5,Great little gadgethas brought new life to my old nano and shuffle.Would recommend
4,Small compact and good
5,Good value for money device. It won’t do everything you want but it transmits when you need it.
2,It Is not Clear from The AptX Website that this product contains a licences aptX chip for high quality Bluetooth transmissions. However basic audio transmission does work. Certainly the aptX LL (low latency) function does not work.  With two of these transceivers the lag is around 250msec instead of 40msec which means that my original intention to play an electronic piano via Bluetooth is not possible.  By the time I found out the 30 day period to return the item had run out.
5,Cant charge while in use
4,First class gadget does the job very well no fuss and easy to use. I like it.
5,Just awesome.  With this any device can receive or transmit audio via bluetooth! Just great and very good quality sound with no delay.
5,Good quality item. Works well as described.
4,Would be much better if it auto started and paired on detection of power on (car ignition start).
5,Really impressed with this product. It was easy to pair with my headphones and has a number of connection options so that I can connect to my TV HiFi or any number of other devices. BRILLIANT!I would highly recommend this product.The sellers support is second to none.
5,Very good product using with bose qc35 2 and quality is very good dont look like have and lip sync issuesRecommened!
1,Got this transmitter to connect my Bluetooth audio system from my tv Unfortunately I have to return this product as it does not work as it said. After hours of trying to connect the transmitted to my Speakers it never worked i tried with an alternate speaker and when it did connect the audio was at least 3 seconds delayed and the audio quality was poor. I do not recommend this device.
5,Great productWe used it to watch a film whilst on a flightIt was easy to connect the ear phones to and worked perfectly throughout the flight
1,Bought this to use my AirPods Pro with my Classic Ipod. Alas the volume level with everything on maximum was just a whisper. So do not buy if this is what you are hoping to do too. I returned the item for a refund. I also noted that the website and social media for Trond were unavailable. Useless.
5,Tidy and effective device. Instructions were in the box but I also got an email offering additional advice in the event of pairing difficulties so i thought that was nice.
5,Used it to connect to a scanner with wireless headphones. Had no issues with pairing
5,Was easy to set up and worked well with two headsets.
4,Ok
5,I bought this so that I could listen on my Apple AirPods to TV & music on the running and bike machines at the gym.  Connected first time and works perfectly.  The only very minor criticism is that it could be louder.
5,Was fairly easy to set-up.  Use it mainly to play music from tv which doesn't have bluetooth capability.  Pairs perfectly with a bluetooth speaker.  Would consider buying again.
5,What I expected and works perfectly.
4,l'apparecchio è molto discreto funziona benissimo sia in tx che rx la batteria ha una durata più che sufficiente per la maggior parte delle operazioni (almeno 5 ore) unico neo è un po' lento con il pairing ma per il resto e consigliatissimo
2,Bought it to be used as a Bluetooth transmitter for the iPad to connect two headphones but the headphones keep getting disconnected and the time to set up again means it's not feasible when watching movies or shows.
3,useful but I find that it does not automatically pick up the only previously connected headphones. Charge does not last as stated in the leaflet
5,I use this from my Mac using Spotify to my Sony WH-H900N headphones .I would recommend  this unit easy to use and has all the leads you need .
5,Neat small but very effective device.
1,Lasted one month now sound has gone distort through all connected devices tried in another car with different 3.5mm and still same tried my different branded one in same car and works OK. So not good value at all 1month and can't return.
5,Great Product does what I need to to do but still room for improvement.
5,Arrived on time I plugged it in and it works fine what more would you want.
5,It works well and is simple to connect
5,Seems to work really well
4,it works ok
5,It is easy to use and the sound quality is good. I have not used it as a receiver but have used it with different speakers
1,This transmitter paired with my Sennheiser HD 4.50 headphones but would not reconnect. I had to reinitiate the full pairing process each time it was switched on. A very tedious process which really should not be necessary so I returned the transmitter and bought another type that reconnects perfectly every time.
1,It is not true that this product is suitable for 2 devices because it always disconnect which is very annoying for me to eat up serval times when I am watching movie. Also sound volume for 2 devices are different that one is louder and another is in a low voice. Very disappointed with this poor quality but expensive product. Not recommend and want to return and refund ;((((((((((
2,Unfortunately I cannot use this product for the reason I purchased it. The sound delay is too long and what I hear does not match what I'm seeing on the screen.It would be fine for listening to music where such a delay does not matter but it cannot be used for anything involving images.
5,Great product support and after sales one of the best I have encountered from an online purchase.A refreshing change from the "box shifter" attitude.
5,ottimo
5,LIKED THE ADDITIONAL INFO TROND SUPPLY IN  ADDITIONAL EMAILS THEY REALLY WANT YOU TO GET THE BEST OUT OF THEIR PRODUCT
4,Super produit aucun problème de connexion et fait avec une certaine facilé. je le recommande volontier a tout le monde
5,Used for pairing phone to car audio system. Just plugged 3.5mm into audio jack and USB into 12 power supply via an adaptor in the cigarette lighter. Switched it into receiver mode and paired with phone.... Easy.
4,Only thing to improve would be battery charge life.
5,Does exactly what it says - works great for my TV so I can use headphones while exercising
5,Connected guitar to an alexa
5,Easy to connect potable sound quality is great
5,It works perfectly. We have 2 sets of headphones now working off my iPhone. Very easy to set up and use. The battery charge actually lasts longer than I had expected. All in all really excellent. I fully recommend this.
5,Does exactly what I wanted to do and was very easy to set up. I cannot comment on tech support as I didn’t need to use it
5,Also has good sound quality
3,Ok pour la musique mais pour regarder (écouter) des films passer votre chemin. A chaque dialogues ou quand le niveau sonore baisse le son décroche et suivre le film devient très lourd. Autrement le coté émetteur/récepteur c'est très pratique.Update: pas de décrochage de son avec le jack fourni (j'utilisais un cable plus long).
5,I have only used in transmit mode from TV to bluetooth headphones. Very easy to set up and importantly no noticeable time lag between audio and screen. Very pleasantly surprised - it works exactly as it should and I'd reccommend it.
3,Works as described and even had 2 devices paired at one point but it's fiddly so we don't use it much
5,I use with a wireless headphones and a Retekess radio. Very simple to set up fantastic sound quality. Have also used on TV and HI FI system amplifier. Amazingly good!
2,Nice product but the latency is to high which makes it useless for my application. I wanted to use it as an in-ear system together with my headphones when playing guitarr to music but since the latency is to high its imposible.
5,Excellent piece of equipment. Has "quality" written all over it. Easy to set up in both Transmit and Receive modes. Goes well with my Trond headphones phone tablet pc non-bluetooth tv. Very pleased.
3,I bought two pieces to transmit from my DJ pioneer ergo to my homethater.The delay to my headphone (wire) makes it impossible to syncronize.
1,Worked well for about 2 weeks then just completely stopped connecting to my headphones. Waste of money tbh
5,Set it to transmit on the switch. Plugged into a Panasonic TX-L47E5B 47-inch TV. Power from the TV's USB socket. Pressed the button until it started flashing and then it paired to my Plantronics headset. No issues.
4,Bon produit malgré baisse de son du casque par rapport au son de la télé sinon fonctionne trèsa très bien
5,Very easy to use just charged it up plugged it into stereo paired it with blue tooth speaker can now have music in any room
5,It works well between my JBL headphones and Sony Bravia tv.
5,Mein Sohn benötigte dieses Gerät sehr dringend und hat sich im Internet nach Empfehlungen umgesehen da dieses Produkt sehr gut bewertet wurde haben wir uns dazu entschieden es zu bestellen. Sehr schnelle Lieferung und die Qualität ist sehr gut. Wir würden jeder Zeit wieder bei diesem Händler einkaufen.
5,peace at last the wife watches catch up tv in bed when im up with the birds keeping me awake well not anymore this thing works a treat  no more MR RED EYES.........
5,Brilliant device & simple to operate highly recommend it.
5,First class product I have now converted my Bose Wave to Bluetooth .First class sound as good as wave Sound link Adapter through the computer .
1,Guide/Handbuch müsste ausführlicher sein
5,Exactly as described low latency easy to set up. I bought two so that they can communicate.
5,Does what it says on the tin!  Paired instantly with my iPhone 6s and an external PA speaker/mixer that I use.  No dropouts in the music.  Excellent value for money.
5,Easy to setup and use.  Works great with headphones for the TV.  No discernible lip sync problems if used with another AptX Low Latency Transceiver.
1,easy connection and reasonable sound quality but not being able to take calls or use control buttons to skip tracks or change volume is a massive downer for me
5,Arrived promptly. Incredibly easy to set up. Worked immediately.
4,greatprice and pretty intuitive To set up
5,Great product bought this to use with 2 sets of earphones for myself & wife to use in our awning abroad so as not to disturb neighbours. Managed to pair them both with this transmitter.
5,Works perfectly on the systems I've tested it through.  Holds a charge for a good period of time (several days in my in car system)
5,Great little gizmo. I paired it with some Anker SoundBuds In-Ear Sport Earbuds and plugged into the audio socket of my Samsung TV and I can now listen to my box sets without disturbing the neighbours.
1,I purchased this to send the sound from my projector to my speaker across the other side of the room. Sound was ok but it was all out of sync so it’s been filed away as a waste of money.
5,Great product! Long lasting battery great sound. Highly recommended.
5,Klein aber fein! Akku hält immer koch auch wenn mann ihn mal ein Jahr nicht benutzt hat. Anschliessen und loslegen. Für spontane DJ Aktionen super weil immer dabei
5,Works well
5,Easy to set up as a transmitter I have not tested this as a receiver yet.
5,A cracking little device that “just works”. Great.
1,He did not work on my projectorVery disappointed
5,Terrific piece of kit. Superb with my Sony Walkman cd player and beats wireless headphones. And it’s so small! Top notch!
1,What a waste of money it’s now in the bin with the rest of the rubbish only paired once and then wouldn’t pair with anything leave well alone
5,Works well
5,I USE FOR TV TO HEADPHONES AT THE MOMENT NO PROBLEM WITH THIS ITEM VERY GOOD.WE USED IT EVERY NIGHT
5,I have samsung earphones' i just put the trond in earphone socket on telly' paired them up' it all works great'
5,Arrivato prima del previsto ( nulla da lamentarsi su Amzon sempre eccezionale)imballo ineccepibile.All apertura tutto come descrizionel ho. Collegato al decoder SKY e ad impianto Samsung surruond tempo di collegamento pochi secondi evita già collegato.Nessun disturbo e nessun segnale di Latenza la musica si sente in modo fantastico (per la gioia di mia figlia).Lo consiglio  a tt quelli come me non  hanno TV o altro senza  WIFI
5,Excellent product have this matched up with Avantree Bluetooth 4.2 Transmitter in receiver mode and it works perfectly.Very happy to recommend.
5,Using BT-DUO to transmit from metal detector and BT-RX S to receive with wired headphones. A good low latency solution for me!
5,Nice and small. Very easy to set up. Worked straight away with my Bluetooth headset. Best to read the instructions before using as it needs changing before use. So far worth the money.
5,It worked as advertised and the service was very quick very pleased.
1,Would not connect to Audi q3 Bluetooth .After earlier review Trond sent another Trond free of charge but second one would still not connect to bluetooth.customer service very good but not had chance to use device.
5,La cosa che colpisce subito è la compattezza dell'oggetto è stato subito riconosciuto dalla mia tv Samsung.Io lo uso come ricevitore lo ho accoppiato alla TV bluetooth e collego la cuffia con filo al dispositivo; nessun ritardo audio nessun disturbo in cuffia.L'unica pecca che posso segnalare è che non funziona mentre è in carica per il resto fa il suo dovere. Arrivato nei tempi come sempre.
4,So far so good
5,Brilliant - simple as that!
5,Pleased with them but looking some working out but so far so good
5,As advertised. Use it with our traditional record player to play podcasts through the speakers. Perfect.
5,I've had a few of these style items and this one has been the best so far. Crisp clear sound no interference when used in the car. Tiny design. Love it.
5,Very pleased with this device. Does everything it says it does.  Arrived to Estonia several days before the ETA date.
5,works well
5,tem worked as described and easy to setupSound quality a limitation of Bluetooth
5,works wellgood distance rangeclearbattery lasts an 8 hour day.used for receiving mainly but transmit has been tried and works not sure of battery life though.would buy again if needed to
5,Exceptional little device great near zero lag works fabulously on planes.  Very very pleased.
5,Works perfectly as transmitter
1,I bought this product in order to use airpods with my tv but I am sad to say that after 1–2 charges the battery life was absolutely diminished and would only last around 20 minutes and then die after a full charge making it completely uselessWould Not Recommend
2,je suis déçue car la notice jointe a cette émetteur et récepteur Bluetooth 4.1 TROND le guide explicatif d'utilisation n'est pas écrit en FRANCAIS et je ne connais que cette langue Serait-il possible d'avoir la notice en Français Ayant acheter ce petit appareil pour mon poste de radio acheter chez-vous (poste DUAL p 68-1 avec prise AUX IN  LECTURE aléatoire CD USB) avec la possibilité de lire des clés USB
5,Had some difficulty setting it up but Trond customer care was excellent and now everything is perfect! Thanks!
5,Excellent piece of equipment. Allows us to use two sets of headphones at the same time with perfect clarity and without disturbing the neighbours. Many thanks. Dermot Maguire
5,Sound is amazing only downside is i have no idea what charge level its at but otherwise its really works beautifully
4,No Problems
5,Rien à redire pour l'instant je ne l'ai que depuis 15 jour. Je l'ai branché sur la sortie HP de la télé et je j'utilise un casque Bluetooth pour écouter la Télé impecable fini les files qui trainent.
1,Does not pair with fresh out the box pair of Apple AirPods 2nd gen. paired with some Sony wi-300 but only one ear (most likely in mono) worked even slightly after turning the tv to max volume but also crazy latency. Put normal headphones in the tv socket (a 4K modern Sony) and works fine. AVOID.
5,Fantastic kit and really good quality sound. Extremely light and ideal for the car or using in the gym having to avoid carrying the phone all the time.
5,Great item works well good price
5,It is very easy to pair with other devices. The range is very good and the battery life better than expected. Altogether very satisfied with the product.
5,Very easily connected and transmitting a good sound.
5,L'ho collegato al cavo Aux della mia Fiat Punto per poter ascoltare la musica dallo smartphone e vi garantisco che funziona perfettamente! Mi ritengo soddisfatto ed inoltre la carica è di lunghissima durata tanto da dimenticarmene puntualmente! Si tratta di un prodotto che consiglio vivamente!
5,Product is well packaged and works great with Bose QC35 bluetooth headphones.
5,Clear and crisp sound no latency.  Simple to install problem less use. Should have bought is sooner.
5,Great bit of tech now able to play my old iPod wirelessly to my Bose speaker. Fantastic.
3,collegato ad una tv mi aspettavo di meglio - dopo un paio d'ore inizia dare problemi non si spegna in automatico e non si può utilizzare quando è in carica (rumore di fondo) - non vale il costo
4,Very good!
5,Worth every Penny Very Good
1,Ich zitiere die Anleitung:Q: Can I use Trond BT-Duo while It's charging?A: No. Trond BT-Duo can be used as Bluetooth transmitter vor receiver while it's charging.Was soll man davon halten? Also bei mir geht es.Aber: Ich verwende es mit meiner Anlage dauernd an eine schaltbare Steckdose angeschlossen. Immer wenn ich sie einschalte leuchtet es rot und ich muss neu pairen ?? Das kann nicht wahr sein - weiß jemand wie man das weg kriegt?Weiter gibt es zeitweise einen deutlich spürbaren Versatz zwischen Bild und Ton beim Fernsehen. Es mag APTX haben aber garantiert noch low latency.Fazit: Leider völlig unbrauchbar.
3,L'ho comprato per utilizzarlo come dispositivo bluetooth per sentire la tv con le cuffie.Funziona bene e non ha ritardo ma dopo quasi due ore incomincia a perdere colpi perdendo il segnale.Soddisfatto a metà.
1,At any reasonable volume the sound becomes so distorted that it is unlistenable. I tried the unit in different devices with the same result testing with high quality Sony 100-MX3 headphones which work perfectly with other devices. I wasn't expecting audiophile quality but this is unacceptable for a product advertising "high quality sound".
5,Funziona bene anche per collegare le cuffie alla TV la latenza è buona e l'audio risulta ben sincronizzato col video.Piccola nota dato che a me è servito se si vuole resettare il dispositivo basta spegnerlo switchare il pulsante da TX a RX o viceversa riaccenderlo rispegnerlo e rimettere il pulsante alla posizione voluta.In definitiva lo consiglio.
5,Works great with no speech lag.  Sound is great on my Plantronics 8200 UC headset.
5,great product i use it with Bower & Wilkins headphones
5,Up & running in seconds works great as transmitter for iPod & receiver for car radio well pleased.Rapid delivery & great customer service.
5,This works great with 2 bluetooth earphones and the audio quality is great.The size is smaller than a credit card which is great.
4,Ricevuto nei termini stabiliti lo uso per ascoltare musica dal mio iPod 160 non Bluetooth con cuffia wireless. Si collega semplicemente e rapidamente. Acquisto consigliato.
5,Great value and it works well paired with 2 Sony MDR-ZX330BT Bluetooth Wireless Headphones when used with our Smart TV.
5,All ok.
4,Facile da usare e risponde alle specifiche dichiarate. Consigliato a chi come me deve collegare una cuffia bluetooth all'impianto dolby
1,Bought to connect TV( without bluetooth) to operate my  wireless sound bar would not work  going to try other options
1,Battery life is not very good
1,Il dispositivo ha una portata molto limitata dal divano alla televisione ho 25/3 metri e spesso il segnale si interrompe ho dovuto usare l'inestetico filo per portare il dispositivo di fronte alla TV per non avere salti audio.Infine ho preso il trasmettitore per ascoltare in cuffia il suono prodotto dal mio organo digitale. Non posso utilizzarlo perché il ritardo fra tasto premuto e suono è di quasi 1” e non i 004 secondi promessi.Lo sconsiglio!
5,I use the transmitter function to transmit audio signal from the Beomaster 7000 to the Beoplay S3 bluetooth speaker.Works fine.
5,Easy to set up between Desktop PC and Hi-Fi and works great as advertised.
5,Works just fine
5,Worked straight out of the box - I use it with Bose headphones and it is great.
5,Da hat wohl mein Vorredner recht blinkt durchgehend ..... :) mich stoerts relativ wenig da der transmitter bei mir  hinterm TV verschwindet.... Qualitaet der Audiotransmittung find ich bei der Preisklasse Top hab da nichts zu bemaengeln
5,The product worked with no problems whatsoever i am not computer literate at over73 years everything was simple to set up thankyou
5,Bought 2one for Tx & one for Rx.Easy set up out of the box and most importantly frees you from cables!
3,Vraiment super outil une excellente transmission mais besoin d'être rechargé trop souvent. Pas tellement facile à utiliser. Il faut en avoir 2.
5,Buen dispositivo
5,Brilliant connected straight away comes with all connectors. Recommended
2,Wanted to use with my old cd-player. It works but audio quality is not good so not really useful. Never heard back from customer service.
5,Connections rapides pas de perte de son pour écoute musique en bluetooth . S adapte bien a tout appareil. content de cet achat à recommander
5,Fast delivery works great.
5,Nice and easy to use. Very good sync with tv.
5,Good
4,Ottimo prodotto ero preoccupato sulla latenza 40 ms ma è ok. Ottimo il supporto e l'assistenza. Molto piccolo e di facile installazione
2,Used as a bluetooth receiver with a set of lightweight earbuds to listen to my TV audible hiss and buzz.Product returned.
5,This product works perfectly. The build is high-quality with great sound and signal quality.
1,L'oggetto funziona bene ma ha un difetto che lo rende per me inutilizzabile con le cuffie: i segnali di notifica (pairing accensione spegimento e SOPRATUTTO la batteria che si sta scaricando che arriva quando non te lo aspetti) hanno un volume assolutamente troppo elevato. L'altro giorno ascoltavo una conferenza in mp3 (basso volume della sorgente) quando è arrivato inatteso l'avviso di batteria (quasi) scarica: per lo spavento ho scaraventato la cuffia a tre metri!!!! Anche ascoltando musica l'avviso di notifica fa soprassaltare! Che senso ha una cosa del genere???? Ho un'altro ricevitore bt e il volume dei suoni di notifica è (giustamente) molto più basso
2,Mit diesem kommentar zum produkt erwarte ich ein feedback vom Verkäufer!Laden während des Betriebes ist laut Bda nicht möglich!Nach dem Ausschalten der Empfänger und des Signals blinkt das Gerät imTX-Betrieb ohne Ende

5,il dispositivo funziona correttamente lo uso da un paio di mesi collegato alla TV ed usando auricolari Bluetooth della Tao Tronics. TT-BH09 IT. Tutto bene nessuna apparente latenza. Ho trovato il manuale su Manualslib anche in Italiano scaricabile in PDF del trasmettitore/ricevitore.

5,Delivered well in side delivery time works well.
2,Il faut le démarrer à chaque qu'on veut s'en servir et ce n'est pas ce qui me convient donc retour expéditeur.
1,Volevo utilizzarlo per rendere wireless il collegamento tra un controller dj Pioneer Sx2 ed una cuffia urbanite sennheiser wireless. Risultato pessimo suono  a pari livello (collegamento diretto con filo ) molto distorto e quel che è peggio una latenza di almeno mezzo secondo che mi rende impossibile il mixaggio con la cassa spia. Lo consiglio solo con un buon telefono .
5,Alla prima prova è perfetto funziona con solo spinotto jack senza necessità di collegare presa audio. Spedizione rapida ed economica. Soddisfatto.
1,Inutilisable pour tout ce qui demande de la synchonisation son-application.Décrochages et couplage laborieux avec le Qc35 de Bose alors que mon smartphone n'avait pas de problème.Bref passez votre chemin pour ces utilisations.
5,Perfect!
5,Funzionamento perfetto sia come ricevitore che trasmettitore.Grazie ai cavi accessori è ottimo per un utilizzo bluetooth non solo di TV ma anche Hi-Fi e cuffie.
5,Fantastico! Lo uso attaccato all iPod da 120 gb e funziona benissimo. Arrivato prima del previsto. Semplice da configurare collegato in un attimo e subito funzionante
5,Excellent bit of kit
5,Il dispositivo funziona molto bene ed è molto utile per guardare la TV con cuffie in Bluetooth. Spedizione arrivata prima del previsto. Tutto perfetto. Consigliato.
5,Si collega facilmente (es. TV) e rileva in pochi secondi altri apparati via bluethooth (es. cuffie) con impiego per diverse ore. Prestazioni eccellenti. Spedizione velocissima.-
5,Funziona e si carica mentre l'usiSi connete subito con le cuffie fa una luce blue quando e acceso.perfetto
5,Ottimo prodotto. Prima in macchina usavo un cavetto per sfruttare l ingresso aux. Utilizzando il dispositivo non ho percepito alcuna diminuzione della qualità audio. Consigliato.
5,Nothing to complain perfect
5,Works great
5,good!
1,can not get it to pair
2,I tried to connect it to my Sony TV and my Samsung ear buds but had no luck at all.  I followed the directions and when that didn't work I went online to look for videos.  Still no luck. I gave it 2 stars because of the reviews online were so good.  Maybe I got a lemon?
5,A compact solution adding bluetooth connectivity to an older car radio with an aux input.Clear sound compare to a wired iphone 8 adapter previously used.
4,Use it to play music from my computer wirelessly over my stereo which is on a different floor. I have an older Trond unit as a receiver. The new one is a transmitter replacing another brand that stopped working. Easy to use
3,Gekocht om met koptelefoon op in slaapkamer (16m2) tv te kijken maar afstand (+/- 45m) is te groot. Geluid hapert en stopt.
5,Small compact easy to follow instructions
5,Funciona perfecto con mis audifonos bluetooth 5.0
3,I originally wrote that it was crackly in audio quality but I realized I needed to modify my physical setup and after that it works really well. Good to have around.
5,Muy buena calidad y exactamente lo que se ofrece
5,Excelente fidelidad de forma bidireccional  larga duración de batería muy fácil de usar los materiales son de excelente calidad todos los adaptadores que incluye son muy buenos
3,Worked well when connected to my projector sound quality good no delays but every few uses I need to re-pair it with my headphones.
4,L'apparei comporte pas de volume .Durée a vie de la batterie aucune donnée.L'appareil fonctionne très bien.Je suis satisfait
4,Paired it with my tv . Cuts out tv speakers . Can’t control volume with remote . My buds don’t have volume control so any suggestions would be helpful.
5,Me encanto que venga con todos los accesorios lo pequeño que es lo hace perfecto para caber en cualquier case de nintendo switch y el tiempo de latencia es al menos a mi parecer muy minimo tanto para jugar como ver peliculas.
1,Will not pair with Sony DRBTN200 headphones. Will not project sound with audio out on my Samsung UN43N5300 tv using optical sound settings.
5,Se conecta fácilmente no tiene retardo y tiene muy buen sonido
5,Great little transmitter worked flawlessly and was very easy to set up highly recommend
4,What was in a soap box-size cassette (and such are still sold by other makers) is in this tiny device. Once it's set up and is kept turned on  it resumes connections to either or both receiver devices without a fault. The farthest I can go is 13 m from base and the connection is still resumed there.  The sound quality depends on  the input and the receiver primarily.  I would not want to try to guess what effect does this transmitter have on the sound on top of the sound source and the receiver. Neither can I compare this device with other makes for sound quality assessment. So I put 4 stars on sound quality to be safe. It is new and thus durability remains to be seen. An earlier small transmitter failed in half a year whereas the soap box sizes went on for a number of years so... overall rating 4 stars.
5,Ease of use
3,I used it as a transmitter and paired instantly. The issue is that the sound is too low even with TV sound set to max.
