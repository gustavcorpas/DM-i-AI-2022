5,I trashed several of my old cassette player not long time ago with all recorded tapes.  But recently I found some tapes with important information on them then have to buy this one that has tape player and radio AC/battery power. I wish it could transfer the tape records to digital. After reviewed the products with digital transfer are not simple and quality. So I decided to get this one.
5,Nice tape player great to hear old tape's
4,My only complaint about it is that it has no input jack for the use of anexternal microphone or telephone pick-up coil.
5,The sound is loud. Easy to use. Has long antenna. Can use batterys or plug into wall.
4,I purchased this product in order to play my old cassette tapes from years ago.  When I first got this it played nice the first few times and then proceeded to eat two of my beloved tapes. I initiated a return process. Before returning a friend of mine who is familiar with music and different devices told me to try something first. He said that tapes have iron oxides in the reels of tape and they can stick to each other if been sitting awhile. He told me to put my tape in and fast forward through the whole thing once and then fast rewind through the whole thing. This should unstick the tape from itself.  Once both of those are done he said to try playing it.This works wonderfully. The machine has not eaten anymore of my tapes. What he said makes sense.  So I think that with all these different cassette players where people were giving poor reviews because the tapes were being eaten it was not the machines at all.  It was the iron oxides in the tapes itself.I decided to keep my machine and it has played well ever since. It is a good machine. The sound is a bit tinny because these are not professional quality machines but they serve the purpose for me.  I am able to enjoy all my music from years ago.
5,# ReviewFor months I had been trying to listen to some cassettes. It turns out that my stereo and two boomboxes wouldn’t play tapes anymore. After some research I decided to go with this Semier boombox from this seller and I’m SO glad I did. I order a lot of stuff from Amazon but I was the most excited to get this radio. So much so that I was checking to see if it had been delivered several times.When it arrived I went out and disinfected it and plugged it in. I put in a tape and my jaw dropped when it played sound instantly. I was starting to think that all boomboxes were no longer playing sound. So needless to say that night I started listening to a tape I really wanted to listen to. To me the quality of that tape sounded as well as any mp3 file would. I also like the volume level when I listen to this boombox by myself. The radio at least where I am in a bit of a mountainous area wasn’t as perfect for the one station I tried but I honestly think that was just because of my area and the distance to the radio station. I can’t wait to try to see if I can try transferring at least a couple of my tapes into mp3 files with an audio converter (DIGITNOW USB Audio Capture Card Grabber for Vinyl Cassette Tapes to Digital MP3 Converter) that I bought here on Amazon. I read on that products page that you can transfer audio by plugging it into the headphone jack which this Semier boombox DOES have. Even if it doesn’t work I’ll still be happy with this radio.I loved this radio SO much that I was about to buy another exact Semier radio. Why? Because I never want to not be able to play my cassettes again and because apparently getting a quality cassette player is not easy to come by. So if you’re on the fence buy this radio. Even though it’s about the size of 1/3 of a sheet of paper it’ll give you joy to be able to listen to your tapes again.P.S. Apparently the reason why some tape players stop playing is because you need to clean specific parts of the player with alcohol. You can Google this or watch YouTube videos. However I'm happy to have this brand new tape player that works and brings me joy via the sound of music.
5,Easy to use
4,The sound quality (fair) is what you'd expect for a low cost item as this. Very easy to operate. Compact design.
3,After returning  my previous one I search & got this one much better  definitely more powerful  sound voice  recording build in not like sony or Panasonic in the 80s to 2000  but well much better for TODAY'S budjet days cassette voice/live  recording.  radio  is o.k not great sound ( reception station & it does sound like a kid toy cassrecorder;!!)but u could listen to/ or record a talk radio show or a ballgame pretty well  n this stuff 4 today I use to love this thing when was made by sony & Panasonic way back n the 80's even they competition was good unit@ that time not today this unit make a  noise when you  rewind it you must hold the bottom  to the noise  calm down  a bit the hand amfm cassette recorder noise is alot smoother then this one & for the best unit to buy.
5,This works great for playing old tapes and is worth the money. Make sure to clean it periodically. It's been used in the process of digitalizing books on cassette and it's working fine.
4,works fine radio and tapes but i cannot get it to work with batteries only...first order returned  thinking it was defectivesecond (replacement) has same problem...fresh batteries inserted correctly  but still no power...i am a mature person who has had many such items and i do know how to use them but with this one its a puzzle..i feel there is something simple i am not doing...HELP
5,This little radio was to replace one that stopped working. Since I had been pretty happy with it I wanted to replace it with the same model. I saw this radio for about the same price but it was smaller and had a modern streamlined look which would much easier fit in with any decor.It was at my doorstep the very next day and what a pleasant surprise it was. Good looking easy to operate the sound is excellent and I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. If it will last as long is as my previous one remains to be seen. The guarantee that came with it is very generous which leads me to think that this is of superior quality too.Oh yes did I say I like it?
5,Listening to old sermons dated in the early 1980’s...
5,Very crisp sound. Surprised at how clear cassette tapes sound on this device. Radio picks up all stations correctly. This unit has a DSP chip for the tuner. Takes a few tries to get the feel of it. Extremely crisp radio sound as well. All stations are clear. The unit is housed nicely. It does not feel cheap or flimsy. Also the brand did not make this over the top retro. It has lines reminiscent of the 1980s-90s. This is an excellent unit for the office. It's basic without all the modern add ons. Bluetooth SD slot etc. It is probably built better than most due to alleviating extra goo-gaa and focusing on old school functionality. I have a lot of music on cassette tape. Honestly it's nice to not have to stream all day and have some type of physical medium to play. I think that the oldsters out there will be impressed with the sound of this tiny boombox. It is VERY PETITE. Press play and enjoy!
5,I just needed this to be able to play some taped services and old cassette tape audio books.  Works great for that.  I have not tried to play any music cassettes from the 80's though so I'm not sure about the sound quality as far as that goes.  My guess- probably will not sound as righteous as the boomboxes from that era ;)  Not bad deal for the money though.
4,i haven't used it yet but from the looks of it it looks like a nice little entertaining piece of equipment
5,Product is terrible! You have to literally push the play bottom and hold it to hear a song! How terrible. Brought for my father who likes to listen to his old school tapes!
5,I like like the sound of my old cassette
3,Excellent unit for a fair price.  FM reception is great.  Instructions do not include how to turn it on or off however.  Have to unplug it every time.  E mailed the person listed in the instructions about that....no response.
5,I bought this for my 90 year old dad and he loves it. I had purchased a different inexpensive one and immediately returned it because it was junk. I ordered this one and for the price it is easy to use and the sound quality is excellent for the price and for someone who just wants to listen to his 100+ Cassette collection in the car.
5,When I was a kid I used to record music off of the radio on my tape and when unpacking I found a ton of them so I bought this so I could listen to them it has been a lot of fun.
5,I've read that some of the old cassette players eventually stop working (my old one did so).  I've only had this a short time and it is working perfectly - simple to use and sounds good for a small portable player.  The maker encourages owners to contact them if there is ever a problem and I find that encouraging to show that they care.
5,Great little radio!
5,Love this little guy! Sounds great. No problems. Listening to all my 70s and 80s cassettes without issue. 😀
4,The sound is great and it's nice-looking and compact but the cord keeps detaching itself from the recorder.  They gave me a $30. gift card which was nice.
4,The term "retro" fits - mono output (except with headphone jack) tried eating the first tape I tried to play but I caught it soon enough to prevent irreparable damage.  The sound is OK for the tape player but I would likely use the headphone jack to get stereo.  The radio works well.  I would not get this for someone else. It's much smaller than I expected in size but like the title says it works. For the money I wouldn't expect much.
5,It’s a basic tape / am/fm player . Has no base . Just basic model . Works for my mother in law
4,when we were dating my husband made me hundreds of mixed tapes (cassette) and I haven't been able to listen to them for years. got the little unit and now can listen to my heart's content. the sound is small but clear and crisp. I'm not head banging any longer but at least I can hear the tunes that made me dance. but the surprising part of this is the radio. clear and tuning is effortless. I forgot how fun listening to the radio can be.
3,This product is made in China.  I had high hopes for this unit but it fell short so I returned it and received a prompt refund.  Maybe I had expected to much for this price point?  I had initially left a scathing review for this product and the company actually reached out to me and was concerned.  We had a good conversation and worked things out.
2,Not to suggest that this is the norm as I assume most do not have this problem. However no matter how much I tried the tape did not appear to play. It worked on other devices just not this one. The same was true for any other tapes I used.
4,DECENT ONES ARE NOT THAT EASY TO FIND--DUE TO BEING LEFT BEHIND BY MODERN TIMES.I TRUST THE CASSETTES BY THE MAIL--BUT NOT EMAIL AND OTHER CURRENT DAY COMMMUNICATION METHODS FOR MORE PRIVATE TRANSFER---
2,The motors are super loud and they really distort the playback sound. I'm sending it back. Looks like a few are identical just different named.  I was using it for music  so if you're just going to use it for dictating it won't matter.
2,I loved the size of this thing. Portable easy to use and lightweight (it is entirely plastic of course). But the sound from this boombox is pretty awful especially if hooked up to speakers larger than the single one onboard. It’s not far from the music quality you get listening to hold music at your doctor’s office. I ended up returning and buying a better (but more expensive) tape player.
4,this was hardly used and is already broken in just over 7 MONTHS! We contacted the email address on a sticker at the back of the player. No idea where that would get us or if we could return it. NOT WORTH BUYING!
5,Bought because I found a bunch of old tapes from my grandma from 1977 and wanted to listen to them. I found a player at the Goodwill and it ate one tape. With them being so old I was nervous they wouldn’t work. I took a chance and so glad I did. They worked and it was able to hear my grandmas voice again after all these years! Sound was so clear and just a great player. She’s been gone for 29 years and this player made her come back to life.
5,I bought this for my Down Syndrome sister and it plays great and it plays cassettes which is what she prefers over CDs. Liked it so well I bought another for myself to use outside and around the house.
5,I just love this cassette player and radio.  Now I can finally play all my cassettes.  Some I purchased and some I recorded .  My old cassette players no longer worked so I can not use them.  They were not worth fixing.  Cheaper to buy a new one and I did.  No regrets
4,They don't make portable cassette players the way they used to. We tried another retro player (twice) with dismal results and after reading other reviews about this player -- and specifically how well the cassette deck performed -- we decided to give this one a try. So far so good: radio stations come in clear and strong and most importantly for our purposes the cassette motor is quiet and tapes play at consistent speed and volume with no phasing or fluttering. Compared to other budget cassette radios on Amazon.com it looks like we picked the right one. All that remains to be seen is its durability ...
3,Perhaps it seems odd to rare this so 'highly' when it sounds like someone is playing music out of a wire and a tin can but at least it plays cassette tapes at speed not too fast or too slow like lots of other similarly cheap or modern players. It sounds better with headphones on - be careful with the volume knob as it seems to have 3 levels - silent loud and deafening. I would not gift this to someone looking for a cassette player as it makes a format with low fidelity even worse. But if you just need a cheap player and radio to keep around this works fine with headphones.
5,I ordered this for my mother. You have to look a little harder for a cassette player these days but this will really improve my mother's quality of life. She is homebound now so all she has is personal visitors tv and music. She loves music and I was so happy to find this cassette player for her. It is just the right size for her small living space. I like that you can run it off of batteries or plug it in to the wall. It is easy for Mom to know how to use also. The product came in good condition and on the day promised. Overall I had a very good experience with this company and this purchase.
4,A bit staticy but okay.
5,I love this radio/cassette player! I’ve been going through my old cassettes from the 90s and it just brings back memories! Been bump in’ my 90s hip hop RnB & Rock cassettes does my daughter!Easy to use! You may plug it in or use batteries. The radio works really well too!
3,Nice boom box but it eats up cassette tapes. Already destroyed two of them. I do not recommend.Updated - they reached out to me and made it right. I have updated my review to reflect my satisfaction.Thank you!
3,This is a nice little radio that I wanted to love. Everything about it is fairly nice except for the tape playback startup. The motor seems slow or underpowered causing it to start playing a slow and distorted sound then eventually speed up to normal speed. This is quite different than the near instant proper playback I am used to for cassette players.It was for the above reason I ended up returning it. I managed to dig out an old Magnavox boom box from 1994 and it's doing a much better job. It is just a shame it's not as compact and nice looking as the one listed here.
3,Playback live recording has a hissing sound like a wind machine that overcomes what you recorded.
5,The sound quality is better than I expected for this price point. I was quite surprised and I am fussy about sound quality. It is easy to use in that there is enough color contrast between the lettering and the background to see the what the buttons and dials are for. The size of the lettering may not be large enough for those with vision problems but this is much better than the last one I tried which I had to throw in the trash. I can see everything well.Overall I am happy with this player and am glad I bought it. Works like a charm.
5,It's nice and compact but the sound quality is fine.  I use it in my van after the tape player quit.  I need an AC converter but it fits nicely between the front seats.
5,Radio is clear. We only can get two channels. Tape player works well. Definitely worth spending a little more for a good product.
5,I bought this for my step mom. I was amazed at how good it sounded!
4,This cassette player has great sound quality for not being stereo.
4,Nice little unit works well in the city.  Got it for someone who lives 25 miles out of city poor reception.  Few stations and over bleed. Disappointed.
2,I bought this to convert some stereo tape to mp3 files.  After about the 5th tape the eject button didn't work and I had to press hard to get the tape out.  I decided to keep trying and used it for a few days longer but again it jammed and this time I had to pry the door open with a butter knife.  Won't open anymore.  Also I noticed that it says "MIC" on the front upper left but that's  just for decoration - there is no mic.  Another thing I did not like about it is that when you press "F.REW" (presumably "fast rewind") not only is it NOT fast but when it's back at the beginning of the tape it does NOT automatically stop...you must push stop...so you have to sit there and wait for it to rewind.  Never tested out the radio.  I did like that it had a power cord not just relying on batteries.  Volume seemed pretty good.  It's very lightweight plastic though it's made to  look metal.  So I'm forced to return it and find something better.
2,Started great but then started to mess up several of my cassette tapes including brand new ones. Now they are all wonky. :-(
1,The first month was good I had no issues. I didn't use it everyday and it malfunctioned. My tapes were played at a slower rate and lower pitch. The malfunction made the audio sounded like their was a voice disguise filter. I stopped using it for a couple months.Come back to use it and it was fine till it wasn't. I was playing my tape for a couple of hours then it went silent and I heard a crackling sounds. I pressed stop opened the player and was horrified that the film came out of the tape entangled in a mess! I tried to be gentle to untangle the film but it was already damaged and cut my film. I was utterly disappointed because this tape recording was a gift from my mom who past away last year. They're important knowledge that she saved for me and I never got to finish listening to it. Never used it since and donated the player.Don't buy it or don't listen to important valuable tapes with this player.
5,If you need a portable cassette player to play all those cassettes that may be collecting dust this is it!  It replaces a similar model by the same manufacturer that worked for years. Solid dependable lightweight. It's nice to encounter a product that is uncomplicated and does what it is supposed to do -- well!
5,I wanted something small and portable but with good sound and I got all of these.
4,We really like the product and am grateful that Amazon had such a product for purchase.  The sound and the ease in inserting cassettes and the east of printed instructions on the product is great.  Thank you.
3,For the money it works well
4,Seems to work for purposes intended. Sound quality is as good as can be expected from cassette. Feel is a bit light and might not be very durable in long run.
5,I guess you get what you pay for the sound quality sucks on it but it's great for what I needed it for
2,I wanted to record my lines for a play I was in so I could study without reading lines.  I could hardly understand what I was reading because the playback sound quality was so poor.  I ended up donating this recorder to Goodwill.
5,Sounds and looks great both the radio and the cassette player work very well!
3,SOUND IS OK.
5,My father in law needed AM radio and a cassette tape player.  This combination along with FM radio are featured on this product. It is easy to use doesn’t have too many buttons or switches and the ones it does have are large and easy to see for older people. The sound quality is great for both the radio and tape player. Battery back up means the he can use it when he sits outside or if the power goes out. Great no frills portable radio!
5,Easy to use sound quality is good.  Good value for the money
5,Player being used to play picture book cassette tapes that belonged to my adult children.
4,Cool small cassette player that also plays radio. Makes me think of when I was younger. Still have some tapes and like being able to play them. Works great and doesn’t damage the cassettes.
5,This is a very well made reliable cassette tape player. I needed something small and inexpensive to play my tapes in my basement exercise room and this fits the bill perfectly. It's well made and although the sound quality won't fill up your house it works great if you're listening in the immediate area at a reasonable volume. Would definitely purchase again.
5,I got to hear my grandfather’s voice tonight for the first time since 1992. Needless to say I’m elated with my purchase. Perfect for what I needed it for which was playing old cassette tapes from my childhood Christmases and birthdays first days of school and even my mom and dad’s wedding from 1966.
2,Ate two tapes right away. Killed them. Sending back. Disappointed.Update...couldn't send back after having it for 30 days and eating 4 tapes. Tapes not getting wrapped around mind you but every time cutting them. Wong sent another and I've used sparingly so far and it has eaten one tape as well. Kind of scared to continue. There's definitely a malfunction with so many reviews saying the same thing.
4,I knew I was buying a small speaker so I did not expect it to be perfectbut it works as advertised so it meets my needs. I am satisfied with the quality.
5,I bought this as a gift for my sister in law she listens to her bible tapes on it every night
5,I like the Carry handle the sound quality and playing old cassettes is not a problem.
4,Tiny and a lil’ tinny but its a lil’ stereo...has a nice weight to it and feels solid. My old blues tapes sound great. Thx!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I ordered this cassette player yesterday and received it the following morning. The only reason I purchased it was to listen to some old cassette tapes we found specifically one of my Grandmother's funeral from 1996. I put my tape in the new player and I could hear my Aunt's voice speaking at the funeral... then suddenly I heard the player making a strange noise. So I stopped playing the tape hit the eject button and it had taken the tape ribbon up inside it and actually cut the ribbon and totally destroyed my cassette. I'm just heartbroken. This is the only recording we have of my Grandma's funeral and it is now destroyed. No refund amount can get this recording back.  I'm just sick over it.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS RECORDER... it's not worth taking a chance of it ruining your precious cassette recordings.  I've attached a photo of my destroyed cassette and a video of this player that still shows a piece of the ribbon caught in the player.
5,I gave it as a gift to someone who has all his music on tape. He looked endlessly at yard sales and eBay for one just like this which is new and less money than the actual older ones . He loves it.
5,I have an old boom box I played my vintage cassette tapes on but once the winter storm hit and there was no electricity I was looking for an updated cassette player and this is the one!  I was truly surprised that the quality of sound was so good!
5,I have a lot of cassette tapes that I enjoy listening too especially while traveling by train.  Bought this small cassette player to use while traveling on the train in a bedroom sleeper. It was just the right size and didn't take up much room when packing.  The sound was great not too loud very clear.  I would definitely recommend this player.
5,I love the  radio cassette player has great sound
5,This is a good little tape recorder and radio. Easy to use. Very portable. Great sound. Good price as well. I  highly recommend it.
5,Have the cassette player to a friend that wanted to play her cassette takes.  She was thrilled with the gift!  She hit out her cassettes and was very happy with the ease to use and the speakers!  It made the 86 year old very happy!
5,Everything works great my son is so happy with it.
3,i love how small it is and compact and it’s not bulky or heavy or nothing. my only concern is when it’s set to tape function to play the cassettes there’s this loud buzzing that won’t go away. now when you switch to radio it’s crystal clear. idk if i’m doing something wrong or what the deal is but just a pain in the neck it’s doing that
1,Just wanted this to play some old favorite cassettes...radio was a perk. The radio worked fine but I tried 6 different cassettes and none of them would play. Easy enough to operate radio had good sound but the cassette part  just didn't get the job done. It's been returned.
4,Very simple to use. The sound quality is good.
5,This was a gift and they love it
5,Excellent gift. Sound is great.
5,Was simple enough for my 90+ year old Mother to listen to her cassette tapes.
5,For recording programs from other sources as well as its built-in radio.  And to take outside when the neighbors are noisy so I can drown them out with good music.
5,I bought this for my father in law he loves it sounds great easy to use FM radio is good and mostly he loves that he can hear his old cassettes he had stored long time ago.
5,I really like this cassette player.  It works really well. Thanks.
2,A radio cassette player is for listening.  This was quite unlistenable.
5,I use it every morning for NPR won't listen to news on television or follow on line so this is perfect for me in size and sound.
5,Exceeded my expectations.
5,this was for my mom who is 92 Its great for her she knows how to use it not a ton of buttons to press.
5,I can't believe how good the sound is. My cassettes are over 40 years old.The sound is very clear and fresh.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Exactly what i was looking for. Played one of my oldest cassette from early 1980s. Even the radio sounded good. Everything was tight and smooth no play or loose knobs/buttons. Well made and good weight. I would recommend this product.
4,Just received this - nice size sounds good
4,It’s very cute..and compact. It takes me back to my transistor radio days..nostalgic!
3,The sound quality is fairly good for a small radio.  Unfortunately its reception for the one FM station  I listen to wasn't very good.  I replaced it with a small Panasonic with excellent reception.
5,Perfect that it can be battery operated and plug in.
5,This small Boombax was exactly what I was looking for to listen to all of my cassettes. I'm surprised of its quality and sound output. If you're looking for a player for your cassettes-this is it!
5,My mom loves to play her old tapes on it. The sound quality is good  especially for tapes.
5,it's compact so it fits anywhere and has great sound - just what i was looking for
4,works great
4,It looks and sounds great!!!
4,Decent sound. Needed to play tapes on.
3,Cassette player worked great for first week. Nice sound from speaker.. AM/FM reception was good. Then the Cassette player developed a noise from the player motor. Loud enough to distract you from the music playing on tape. Returned for a refund.
4,Sounds good and feels solid
4,The sound is so nice and clear . We like it.
2,Love the retro look of this and I wanted it to play old cassette tapes. A few minutes into playing the tape got caught up in the mechanism and got all tangled up. After eating 4 different tapes in this way I sent it back disappointed.
1,Broke after about 10 minutes This seems like a great item for my elderly mother very simple cassette player and radio.  Started playing a cassette tape heard a crackle pop and it stopped working. Only used the tape player about 10 minutes before it broke
5,Had a cassette from childhood I wanted to listen to with my kids so I ordered this one. Love that it has a battery or plug in option. Works really well... probably time to get those Amy Grant tapes from my mom :)
2,This cassette player damaged 3 tapes of mine
5,Exactly what I wanted; to be able to listen to cassette tapes and listen to radio if so desired. Wonderful value.
2,I hate this thing. It ate my first cassette tape that I tried in it a very expensive one too. Then it worked for a few tapes then the sound started and stopped every few seconds with every tape after that. This is a cheaply made product of poor quality. It may look nice and be compact but its a waste of money.
5,This “Boombox” has met or exceeded our expectations in every respect!
5,I love the compact size and great quality of the product ( :
5,This is a needed hard-to-find item.  Most customers have cassettes which we'd like to play but can't.  Older cassette players go bad as the interiors disintegrate
5,Sound is very clear and good.
5,I like the size and the features the sound and sharp look. I bought this product because I needed a to enjoy my tapes and thank goodness I found this product. I love this little boombox.
5,I bought this for my dad and he is very pleased with it. The tuner indicator is very easy to read even for older eyes.
5,I have a lot of old tapes and needed something to play them on.  This radio/tape player work great.  Better than replacing all my tapes with ce's.
5,Nice stylish perfect just what I wanted but I was hoping for a bigger model just like this one
3,Basic. It looks ok and plays cassettes ok. Basic buttons with one small speaker on front. Tinny sound quality with no sound adjustments available. Price should be under $20 not $40. Overpriced.
5,It’s cute it’s easy and I think the sound is great. I have it in my bathroom and I play my old cassettes while getting ready for work and it feels like 1985 all over again!
5,very pleased
5,Exactly what I wanted... Cassette player with radio that sounds great.  Love the retro design. Has good stable weight.  Great value too!
2,So I got it for transferring Cassettes to my computer in MP3 format. If there is silence or the  music is quiet there is a background noise from the motor or gears. I rated it a 2not 1 since I am recording the tapes to my computer and using audacity I can filter out most of the noise and since I am not an audiophile the finished product is acceptable to me. Still it is a fairly steady dit dit dit even between tracks.
5,Like the size and that is not bulky and is lightweightGood sound. Had tried a different unit before and it ate the cassette....this one did not )
5,This retro design was a gift for my 81st birthday and I listen to my old cassettes on it. Perfect for me and I love it.
5,We bought this to listen to cassette tapes with the grandchildren. The sound is good. Easy to operate. The radio has good reception.
5,LOVE the look and sound of it! Stereo is also intuitive and very easy to use.
2,Although the item looks quite nice and had pretty good sound while it worked it ate a couple of my favorite cassette tapes.  I bought the item so that we could take it camping and still listen to music we liked.  (all on old cassettes). It ate the first one and we thought that it was a faulty tape and tried a second tape.  When it ate the second one we packed the unit back up and sent it back for a refund.The seller was very quick to refund our payment.
5,Now I can play my all time favorite cassette tapes from the good ole days.  Very sharp sound.  Love it!
2,Playing cassettes. Worked well for a while now sometimes when I push play it does not fully engage tape and sound not right . Have to hit stop and firmly push play  again. Another cheap Chinese made product.
3,So good to have a cassette player again. This one is everything I wanted
1,It ate my cassette tape. Would not recommend!
5,I bought this so my mother can listen to her old church cassettes.  She loves this and it is very easy to use.
1,After chewing up one of my tapes none of the other tapes worked. Total loss!
5,Wanted to play some old cassettes I had with out breaking the bank. This item did the trick. Works great and seems well made. Will be my camping radio as well.
5,Was looking for a cassette player and recorder for my relative who has a bunch of old cassettes. The ability to listen to radio and emergency stations was a bonus.
5,Really easy to use both plug in and battery options. Sound quality is great! Has a light indication for tuning. Awesome! Thanks.
5,It is easy to use and the sound quality is very good
1,The purpose for which I purchased this item was to record but sorry to say it was hard to get the record button down and then it kept popping up in the middle of the recording.
5,I bought this to test some old cassettes and I was impressed about how something so little can sound so good!
1,Worked fine for a few weeks then it tangled one cassette and finally destroyed another.
5,Well made compact cassette player that includes FM/AM radio. Works with ac cord or batteries.
1,Was excited to use this product. It ate two of my favorite cassette tapes. And sound was distorted.
5,I like the way it looks and feel as well as the way it sounds
5,I bought this for my mother and she absolutely loves it.
5,Great value and nice quality for the price!
5,I love this radio/cassette player. Now I can play all my old cassette tapes.

5,easy to use and with solid sound for the size and price
5,Has a great old school sound very pleasing to look at and it’s very simple to use.
5,Easy to use . Very retro and cute
5,Love this player. listen to the ballgames while doing yardwork is a bonus
2,When recording radio stations this product is inconsistent.  At times a recording  is audible and  at other times a recording of the same radio station  is not.  I have no idea what accounts for the difference. I found it difficult to use batteries with this radio without them popping out of place.
5,Crystal clear sound and cassette sound is outstandingI would recommend it to anyone
5,I absolutely love my new radio! A very good purchase that I recommend to anyone who decides to buy this product.
5,The player sounds great and came in in a short amount of time.  Great deal for the money
5,Easy to operate sound is clear tape does not jam
5,gives a good sound considering the size of the  unit.
5,It’s perfect for what I need it for
5,love listening to my old tapes. great purchase.
5,Very happy with this purchase! The sound is very good especially for such a small tape player.
5,Just what I needed to play old music cassettes good radio too!
3,Great for my old school Mom to play her cassette tapes. Nice and compact
3,The antenna broke the first week I got it.
1,I got this to play and record cassette tapes. The radio reception was terrible even with local channels. I overlooked this because the tape player worked well. For a couple weeks. Then it played really slow with all cassettes. Songs were barely recognizable. Buttons would stick. I guess they don’t make cassette players like they used to. Great player that doesn’t last.
5,The sound quality is fantastic for such a small boombox!!
5,Is perfect 👍🏼
5,Personal listening of cassette tapes
1,I purchased this cassette player about a year ago.  I just recently started using it to play a valuable cassette that I've had for over 30 years.  The player ate this irreplaceble cassette last night.  No fixing the tape.  Totally mangled in the player.  Will be trashing this cassette player after this review.  If you have valuable cassettes do not purchase this player....
5,So far it's a great little device.
5,Great sound appearance cassette tape & play/record.
5,Small cute and works. Does the job.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I love it!!
5,Am/fm radio works good tape player opens and closes good and stays closed.
1,Ate the first tape I put in
5,Good sound quality value for money
5,Very happy with my purchase . Good quality . Sound is awesome.
1,I wrote review too early.  Played 1 tape all went well.  I was thrilled to hear my daughter's voice when she was 5. (50 now).  I put in a 2nd tape.  The machine ate it beyond repair.  Finally got it out of the machine and put in 3rd tape.  Machine ate that one too.  I returned machine.  Wouldn't recommend to future buyers!
5,No complaints at all
5,Mostly for the cassette tapes
5,Just what I needed. Works great!
1,Sorry I don’t understand the good reviews! I received this piece of crap and the tape player did not work at ALL - don’t waste your money! Thank god I received a refund thank you Samantha! Such a disappointment!! I junked mine!
5,Very good so far.
5,Gracias
5,Educational programs.
5,Works great even playing some old cassettes.
5,love it
5,the sound quality is nice
1,Sound quality of my NYC radio stations is terrible and I live in the NY Metropolitan area! Transistor radios and other portable radios I own are wonderfully clear.
5,Speakers
1,This tape player only worked a few times..Then completely stopped working???
1,This shouldn't be called a "boom box;" you can hardly get any volume even at 4 feet away.  I played it on my kitchen counter with maximum volume but I had to stand right in front of it and not walk around. It's really not a stereo either as it has only 1 speaker.  Very disappointing. Thank you  Amazon for giving me full refund and no postage fees.
1,tape compartment
1,Wow. I’ve reached a conclusion. Either anyone who gives this item more than 1 star is lying or don’t know a damn thing about a quality cassette player. This piece of turd is horrible. Tinny sound with lots and lots of wow and flutter. Total garbage.  Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a used one from the 80s or older.
1,It doesn’t readThe tapes anymore so I need a new player
1,Product did not work at all. Very disappointed
1,It completely ate the tape and the eject button doesn’t press all the way down to open the slot door. I was so excited for this to arrive only to be completely disappointed by it!!!
1,Seems fine radio functionality is good. Unfortunately I purchased to record sound and the record functionality broke in less than 24 hours. Pretty standard imported junk from Amazon.
1,Really poor AM radio tuner. There is constant clicking noise on ANY station. Then  the sound disappears until you turn the volume knob up or down.
1,I bought this to listen to my deceased brother's music on some tapes and it ate one. I'm going to try to get the tape repaired but this is just awful. Dont buy it.
1,Broken shortly after return window.  Doesn't play tapes now and radio doesn't work.  It clearly has power... so it's a40 dollar tape rewinder.
1,I was looking forward to listen to my 80”s cassettes and old school . Radio 📻. Unfortunately the player didn’t work . So I had to return it.
1,Couldn't get door closed after putting in the tape. Specifically  wanted a tape player. Sent it back for refund.
1,Horrible.  Cassette player only worked for a while. Very upset that it was a gift for my father and it doesn't work anymore. Button's for cassette player don't work.
1,Who ships electronics in a paper bag? product was received damaged maybe due to poor packaging and handling.Volume is low even on the highest setting. Would not recommend.
1,Radio comes in clearly but the cassette player ate two of my cassette tapes.
1,Destroyed priceless tape first play
1,Product broke within a week of using it. Would not recommend.
1,Cheaply made and defective.I had to return it for a refund.
1,it stopped working after less than a month. awful!! i will be returning
4,Its good just what i was looking for
5,This is the second audio product I’ve gotten that’s made by this company and I am impressed by them. They make good stuff. This tape player/recorder and AM/FM radio is quality goods. The sound quality is impressive. I’m able to receive a bounty of radio stations. I love having the means of playing my old cassette tapes and it’s a bonus that the machine can also record audio onto tapes. There’s a headphone jack for when you need to listen that way and you can either plug the device into an electrical outlet or have it run on batteries for when you need it to be portable. Retro and right on!
5,It is perfect!  Gave it away as a Christmas present and they loved it!
5,Looks great and works very well!
5,In this day of streaming services no one listens to cassette tapes. Unless like me you bought a large box of gently used Agatha Christie on EBay a few years ago. I hesitated to buy this player just for some old tapes but I love them and none of the players I have still worked properly. It came today and I am thrilled. It sounds great and manages to get through even slightly damaged places.  It’s like getting the box all over again! In addition the radio gets great reception and is a welcome bonus. It’s very nicely styled in appropriately retro fashion. I may add a Bluetooth transmitter to the headphone jack so I can use my AirPods
4,So far so good. Will update after using for a longer period of time. Easy to use. Plug in or battery power radio and cassette. Perfect for what I wanted.
5,Nice.
5,The quality of the recording was GREAT ☺️
5,My mother in law wanted a cassette player. This was inexpensive and works like a high dollar one. Sound is excellent easy to use. Don't regret buying it at all.
5,Bought this as a gift for my dad to play his old cassettes & i was worried that cus the radio was so inexpensive that it might ruin his 30 year old tapes but it hasn't so far! The radio is simple which was a big selling point for me so he doesn't need any help operating it. It's lightweight but sturdy. The sound quality is nice too- would recommend for anyone looking for a radio & cassette combo w no frills.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Pros: Video shows a heavy bass orchestra playing a Christmas Carol. The box sounds very good handling those heavy bass chords. It is a nice little package.The tape player plays smoothly with excellent voice sound.I really recommend this little dynamo.I bought it for my grandchildren to play their audio books with cassette tape.It also plugs into wall outlet with regular plug or can use batteries for wireless.Very successful purchase.The only con: it looks like a white and grey player advertised on Amazon. It is actually all grey with a darker grey front.
5,The unit arrived defective and was promptly replaced w/new product.  The customer service agent was most helpful in resolving the situation.  I received the new replacement shortly which works as advertised.  It is just what I wanted to listen to some tapes or music while putzing around in my  man cave.  Not "stereo" (only one speaker...) but it works great for my use exactly as I had hoped.  Ths sound is as loud as I want and is quite clear.  Great product at a fair price.  I was asked to simply dispose of the original non-working unit which was easily accomplished via garbage can.
5,Although it was smaller than i had expected the person i bought it for said it was just the right size that they needed so it worked out well. Sounded good. Arrived quickly n in good shape. Overall no complaints.
5,It’s satisfactory for my purpose
5,My 83 year old father wanted to play his old cassettes and this works well.  Volume needs to stay at max but I think it is because tape quality
2,I have tons of cassettes tapes w/my favorite songs on & a hand held player for when I walk.  I ordered this cassette recorder to record some more songs for my walks and this machine plays the songs back "slower" then the speed of the song so it sounds wrong? It plays like the songs are lethargic!  Trying to get another one in exchange to see if it works any better. The SLOWER playing songs make my walk SAD! "Can you replace my cassette player for this one . I really like to have music when I goo for walks?
4,Only thing I didn't like about it is that it has no on/off switch.! If you want to turn it off you have to take batteries out or unplug cord from outlet. I thought that was strange. But otherwise it's a good little radio to have in case of an emergency.
1,First of all it doesn't have a sound quality like a bass and a highs. Second it actually breaking my tapes.Third I don't really like it
5,Good price.
5,I liked the small size. It is perfect for listening to educational tapes I have plus taking the radio anywhere in the house and listening to it
5,Sound - INCREDIBLEEasy to use - INCREDIBLEValue - INCREDIBLE
5,Works great. Would recommend 👍
5,Very nice for listening to my old cassettes. Small and compact.
5,This was a gift for my father in law
5,Works great
5,One week update……..omg the second day I put my cassettes in nothing moved. I tried numerous cassettes and those which worked fine on Wednesday did absolutely nothing on Thursday. No play no fast forward no rewind. Just a noticeable and ominous hum coming from the unit. I have never owned an electronic item that failed so quickly. So so so disappointed…Solid little radio! Tape player works perfectly! I love it that although the radio is not digital it holds the station firm. Smaller and more compact than I expected. Not really a ‘boom box’ but perfect for my needs.
5,It has good sound and is easy to operate. The radio has good selectivity. I can easily find a station.
2,This radio cannot receive any of our local AM radio stations -- except one.  I'm in the SF Bay area and this radio cannot even get KGO or KCBS the two giant stations of the area that broadcast to the whole west coast.  I tried it both on batteries and on AC.  I moved around in the house looking for better locations but to no avail.  On the FM band it was a little better receiving 3 or 4 stations with nice sound -- but for FM the tuning dial is so "touchy" that it was challenging to zero in on the right spot on the dial.  The upper end of the FM dial is so jumpy that hitting a station on the first try is almost impossible.  And for many of them the 2nd and 3rd tries don't work either.  I didn't try it as a cassette player but its radio functionality is absolute rubbish.  This one gets returned.
5,My old friend was talking about all the old cassettes he had of old radio shows but couldn't listen to because he new car didn't have a cassette player. So I bought this for him & he told me he loves it. He was pleased with the quality & that the AM/FM radio worked very well. He also said that despite how old his cassettes were they played very well. None of them were eaten up! Good buy.
5,The radio worked until it didn't and they promptly replaced it. They're great.
5,So easy to use. We are happy to listen to our old cassettes. Great sound easy to use!
4,Use it to listen to traffic report  in the morning the volume control is a little off  hard to keep it down low
5,This tape player works well and sounds pretty good for a very reasonable price.  It arrived quickly too.
5,Great sound and plays cassettes  also AM/ FM.
5,I paint pictures as a hobby and to make a little money and found good all music that I loved and wanted to hear again. This Boombox Radio Cassette is great easy to operate and not to big so is right next to my paints with easy access to insert cassettes or just listening to the news.  A Great Buy.Easy transaction.  Thank you.
5,*Update... was replaced by manufacturer. EXCELLENT customer service!This has quit working after ONLY 6 months........highway robbery!!!!Sooooooooooooooo DISAPPOINTING!! Description stated a ONE year manufacturer’s warranty.....sending back. What a HASSLE!!!
5,Easy to use sounds amazing for it to be small boom box.  Buttons easy to see and marked well.
5,The radio reception was excellent!
5,It replaced the same one that I ordered before that was not working. I received the new one and it’s working very well and I’m happy
5,Small but we will keep it.
1,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and I grew up in the boombox era so I know how to work a tape player. This has no power plugged in or with batteries. Highly disappointed - waste of money entirely and now we have to wate for a new one so she can listen to her Gorillaz tapes. I hate that everything on Amazon is hit or miss
2,This is alot smaller then it looks in the picture. Disappointing...I did buy this for my birds so they had something to listen to when I am out. So to soon to say anything on this. Will rewrite at a latter date
5,Puts out a great sound for a little player. I never thought I’d have a need for a cassette player in an emergency but I did. We needed the player for a funeral and it was delivered in less than 12 hours without any additional charges. We are very happy with the product and the service.
5,Muy buen producto llego rápido y al momento de probarlo funciona a la perfección mi abuelo está contento con él.
