4,I've been using this one for recording with some friends of mine and it's a huge improvement over the built-in mic in my laptop.  I wasn't looking to spend a lot of money since this isn't a "professional voice operation" but for the price I was surprised at how good this sounded next to the mics my friends had.  It's a little cumbersome sitting on a wide tripod (I assume there's a way to use a different stand but for me it's fine) that you might want to be aware of if you have limited desk space.  It's also not something that I think would work for recording multiple people around a table to carry around or to use for interviews on the fly so bear that in mind as well.  Overall I'm really happy with it.
5,I set this up at a whim to play with someone I barely know online. Played with my headphones on a bit and had no issues. Tested the volume settings on Windows with my friend. Set it to 100%. Placed the mic right behind my keyboard. Played with my speakers blaring gun shots. He heard me the whole time.
5,I was being told during online meetings that my sound quality was really bad.Someone suggested this Ice external microphone so I tried it and it works great! They say it sounds like I'm in the room!
5,This microphone worked great for my usage!
5,So another gift and was amazing out the box the sound was super good and had no weird ecos or anything like that just clear sound and the metal body is a great idea for this thing
4,It’s a great starter mike for its price. It works with my gaming PC spectacularly especially since I don’t love headset mikes. The problem is when it gets hooked into the work Mac. It sounds like I’m underwater and garbled and no amount of playing with the settings or messing with the hardware helped. I am overall satisfied and I’m sure a savvier person could get it to work but I couldn’t.
5,i get lots of compliments on this mic! my brother has this same mic and hes had his for about 5+ years and it still works great. it tends to pic up some background noise but if you have some kinda noise supression system or voice meeter banana it sounds great! overall great for the price
5,No puedo pedirle más a un producto tan económico. Lo malo es que no es compatible con el software de logitech
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             (My video is this review but spoken into this mic so you can hear the quality.) I have never had a microphone pick up my voice correctly. When I speak low it fades out when I go high it cuts out. This microphone quite contrary catches everything I say without picking up weird background humming! I'm not like some bonafide super special feller who knows that of which he speaks of when it comes to mic quality but I find this instrument one of the best I've messed around with while dabbling. It's heavy! The ball core is like lifting a puppy. The stand that comes attached needs the screw at the bottom tightened to keep the legs mostly stable.I have chosen to completely ignore all the other reviews explaining safety and secure desk holds and I just stick the dang thing anywhere. On a table on my keyboard shoved it in amongst a pile of pillows. Look I'm not that professional when people aren't looking and my desk is literally my bed. He doesn't fall over and he picks up my noises no matter where I put him. (Oh no I've gendered it. Next comes naming it and that's when you know you love things too much.) I've been singing karaoke like crazy and my poor long-range boyfriend who has hearing issues can finally hear my real voice clearly and properly.I bought a pop filter it hasn't arrived yet but I'll probably need it but for now the pop pop pop isn't unreasonable.The red light on the front is obnoxiously bright I just put a little tape over it. Simple. You need a quiet room for using this but not too much of one. My heater going off doesn't register for instance neither does my computer. I'm gonna crunch some fresh snow from outside so you can hear how crisp it is though with a metric you can actually copy probably. [I end up getting snow everywhere on my keyboard and my mouse so I'm moving and dropping them here.]I love it it was well worth the money (I paid $30 or so thanks to repackaging and used but worth the $50 or so.) and I can already tell this little cutie (and it is cute my aging mother saw it and started giggling and wanted to hold it) is going to be a fine part of my vocal life.Edit: I have no idea why the review is an hour long. It's only a 2 minute clip on my computer. I must've rolled a 1 on uploading.
4,This is one good microphone a big one with really bright red LED light and very good sound quality
5,Captures the clarity of intonation tone articulation and more.
4,I really like the sound quality on the mic. Snowballs are one of my favorite types of mics especially for gaming. I got it in white it looks really nice and easily plugs into your computer. The only thing I would say is that the mic isn't adjustable. It's advertised on the box as having an "adjustable mic stand" but it really only has one height. When you try to adjust it it just clicks into place. Not a huge issue or a dealbreaker and other than that it's a pretty good mic.
5,The sound is perfect. My viewers can hear me clearly. Plug and play works without any setup. No bulking mic stands and arms just a cute small globe with a tripod.
5,This is a small microphone but has big quality. Works great and is easy to use.
5,Like the title says this is a great start mic it’s inexpensive and do not lack quality! Highly recommend it for anyone just starting out!!
4,This is my second "cheap" microphone and I absolutely love it. Initially I purchased this microphone for podcasting but decided to see how it would handle voice overs. Though I am upgrading to a better microphone for voice acting this microphone does very well. It picks up my voice clearly and does not have that weird fuzzy static in the background. Though this is a great microphone I will not use this for professional voice work but for "for fun" gigs.This microphone is great for beginners because you can plug it into your computer (I use Windows 10) change the microphone settings on your computer for "snowball" and you're good to go. For those on a budget that need an audio software program I suggest running this microphone with Audacity. Audacity is 100% free just so you know and is beginner friendly. But you can choose what works best for you.This microphone is VERY sensitive and will pick up more than just your voice. Find a very quiet place in your house like a portable recording booth or closet if you want to use this for voice over work and do not have a studio. I have noticed that when my back was facing the door and the microphone was right in front of me I was picking up sounds from upstairs. My door was closed but I could still hear small noises upstairs. The best place to position yourself is with your back to a wall. That way the microphone picks up less noises behind you. Also invest in egg crate foam! It helps tremendously.The best distance to sit from the microphone would be about 6-8 inches away. Best way to gauge this is make a "y" or ASL "Y" with your fingers in the space between you and the microphone. (Put your pinky and thumb up and put the other fingers down.) Touch your pinky to or just in front of the microphone and your thumb to your lips or the space just before your lips This distance works for me every time but you might find a different sweet spot for your voice and that's fine.Happy recording gaming podcasting or streaming!
5,Es bueno para grabar videos y podcast se reduce el ruido exterior
