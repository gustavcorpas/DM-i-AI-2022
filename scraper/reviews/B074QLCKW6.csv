5,3 weeks in traveling around Italy and as you can see by the pic it was charging every night 2 phones one smart watch 2 gopro batteries one heat pad and one cpap machine it work perfect every rime!I only gave it 5 stars because it was the highest they allow. ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆
4,Not enough amps for hair dryer but good for phone charging
5,Worked great for our trip to Scotland and Ireland. Used it to charge our phones my laptop my camera batteries and my hair straightener. Only issue was the camera battery charger was really wide so when that was charging we could only use the one outlet. Used both the USB and the outlet plug for charging our phones and iPads.
5,It worked with any issues. It was adaptable to different situations.  It was easy to transport.
5,This adapter worked great during our recent trip to Italy. This was able to keep up with all of our device charging and hair curling needs. The USB ports were ideal for charging our devices and the plugs worked great for both chargers and the curling iron. The part that really stood out though was the plug. It was VERY sturdy and made a VERY solid connection when plugging into different outlets at the different places we stayed. There were other families traveling in this group that had purchased other adapters with flimsy plugs and there were MULTIPLE of these plugs that were broken throughout the trip. Ours was SOLID and kept on working just as it needed to. We could plug all of our devices in and the only issue was keeping all the cables untangled. . . but when isn't that an issue!!
5,It did what it was supposed to do.
5,I bought this before my trip to Europe. It worked well in each of the countries I went to and didn’t burn out my curling iron like other brands have done previously. It also comes with adapters and a felt bag to keep everything together. Overall this worked great and made it easy to carry around.
5,Used it every night to charge watches headphones phones. Worked great.
4,The unit will not accept plugging two new ipad/iPhone chargers in at the same time. Both require wide transformers which will not fit in the two outlets as configured. Neither cord uses standard USB connections so cannot be inserted in the USB charging ports. Otherwise it’s a very good versatile charging converter.
5,Bought this International power converter for my upcoming trip to Europe.  Love all the options with 2 plug-ins and 4 USB ports.
5,I took this product with on a trip through Europe. There were adapters for every outlet we came across EXCEPT the outlets we found in Switzerland. They had 2 smaller holes in recessed outlets. This unit only provides the larger two prong option which wouldn’t fit the recessed portion plus the prongs were too large for the holes so I had a to buy an adapter there to make it work. That was incredibly frustrating but other than that it works great.
4,I picked this up for a trip to Spain this summer so I haven’t used it yet.  While not as compact as some converters that I have used the versatility of this unit is amazing.  I love the four USB docks.  I have multiple devices and it will be great to charge the all with one outlet and the cord is actually a benefit in my book.  I have a couple other converters that plug directly into to wall and they inevitably fall out.  There are multiple adapters for most countries including what appears to be Italy.
5,Great product used it in the UK for my US devices including a power strip for my computer and iPhone charger. The included adapters will allow me to use it in other countries.
4,We live in Europe and Asia half the year so needed a converter to do a lot of work virtually every day all day. This product has been good but not great. After about 30 days one outlet got super sloppy and few things we plugged into it would charge without giving it a constant wiggle to ensure the contacts were engaged. I had to take it apart repair the tension springs inside the outlet and then it worked well for a while before I had to do it again.It's also a little noisy with the fan running constantly. Lastly it's not a very compact system although I can't argue it has been very useful with all of the USB ports.I would still buy it again.
5,I picked up one of these converter/adapters for a two year stint in West Africa with a couple of trips to Europe mixed in. I'm just wrapping up year two and here's where we stand:I have not had a single issue charging my small electronics via the USB ports and I run low wattage items through the plugs like my bedside diffuser. I like that they can be powered on and off easily and the multiple adapter plugs make them usable just about everywhere in the world. They're small and quiet with a noticeable white noise hum that I got used to very quickly and only notice when I turn the device off. I don't mind the cord length - I actually appreciate being able to move the converter away from the wall. It's a really nice design easy to pack and store.My two Foval converters have handled brownouts power spikes sudden surges and blackouts without breaking or damaging the items plugged into them. The only time I lost one was when the voltage regulator went out and my whole apartment started getting unfiltered electricity at spikes of over 300 v (in case you're wondering - that did blow out just about every light bulb in the place as well as all the 220v appliances that were plugged in). I replaced the slightly smoky Foval and haven't had a complaint since!These are not made for high voltage items which is very clearly labeled on the device. Read what you're plugging into the converter before you plug it in and you'll be fine. I have larger transformers for my high-voltage devices. If you absolutely must have your ionic hair dryer you're better off investing in a power converter especially designed to handle that kind of pull.As far as travel converters go I am a big fan of this one.
5,I haven’t used it yet however I tried it at home to be sure it worked very satisfied.
5,Is a bit heavy. Figured out which plugs I needed b4 trip to Italy and Greece. Had a previous experience that blew out my rapid charger.  This one I was more confident.  By using USB connections I didn’t usually risk my rapid charger.  But I did use it at least once in each country and was successful. Both usages were in older not modern buildings.  I recommend.
5,Love love love this product! Compact lightweight and the USB plugs make it easily usable for more than one phone or item. Would buy again 100%!
4,Good
4,Good size for travel the only thing was that i could not charge both my apple watch and iphone (wide charging box/ usb c) - would not fit next to each other; unfortunately there are no usb c ports.
