4,We have had the tablet since Nov 2021. Today is September 27th and the tablet is completely dead. Ordered a new charger and that wasn’t the issue. Now support and returns are closed? Seems like this is a common issue. I have a 3 year old who gets this as a reward for her behavior so it’s very frustrating to not have. I do not recommend save your money and just buy a more expensive tablet now I have to buy a better one and have wasted this money already.
5,My 2yr old grand daughter absolutely loves this tablet and so do I!  I love that you can switch between kid account to parent account simply by opening the iWawa app and can control what she's allowed to download (essential because even kids apps you get from the Play Store will contain ads) as well as time limits etc through the family link app. You can also choose email or text for notification or requests coming from her tablet.There's a lot of kid friendly apps already installed on it as well that are ad free. There's nothing really you can't do on it that you can do on your own phone or tablet for entertainment - as far as game apps or video apps reading apps internet surfing shopping or whatever... It has a good amount of storage and I think I read somewhere you can add more with a memory card..The brightness and sound are just fine as well.  The handles are awesome too because they pivot around and can be used as a kick stand and works better then some of the other ones I've seen on the market. Note the tablet is not removable from the case without removing screws so I wouldn't recommend it.I did have a small issue with the charge port and even though the warranty time for returning had passed; YosaToo the manufacturer of this tablet offer LIFETIME servicing of their equipment! I was able to reach them by sending a message through my original purchase link with Amazon to contact the seller and reached their sales department who provided me with all the info I needed to contact their service department.  I paid a small shipping fee through priority mail to send it back to them to have it fixed and they sent it back within a week!Amy over at their service department was very sweet and a real pleasure to work with. She offered a quick solution and provided me with all the information I needed to get it sent back to them and repaired. My grand-daughter didn't even know it was gone because it was back so quick lol!In my opinion this is a great little tablet that can handle a 2yr old carrying it around. (It's a great tablet for adults too in adult mode!) It's got storage parental controls access to the web the Google Play Store for all the apps you could want - and both the sales and service departments at YosaToo were very easy and pleasent to work with.
4,Received it on Aug 6th. They work great lots of games and easy download. They tend to get slow when there are more games downloaded but not that bad. However the power button on one of the tablets just completely stopped working. These haven’t been dropped or anything. I’ll probably lay be returning it to get fixed or exchange.
4,I got this for my 15 month old son for a long car trip we where taking. Battery lasted about 3 hr into are 7 hr trip before we had to charge it. He loves the handles and throw it around.. hasn't broken yet.
5,So I finally caved and decided to buy my almost 2yr old a tablet so he's not left out when my older kids use theirs and let me just say - we LOVED this one! It has plenty of games and apps already in it so you don't have to spend the time looking for fun educational age appropriate games for your kid. All you have to do is click on one of the apps and it automatically downloads it for you. There's also already a bunch of pre downloaded videos. As a mum I think we all know anything that saves time is already a winner right? It has a separate account for you to set up parental controls and what not as well as a timer so you can set it for however long or little time you want your child using the tablet. I currently have ours set to 20 mins twice a day. Once the 20 mins is up a cute little sleeping bunny pops up so he knows tablet time is done for now and he doesn't put up much of a fight bc " the tablet is sleepy and needs it's nap time!" The separate account for the adults works just like any other tablet so as your kids get older you could always allow them to use the more grown up features it has. Another god sent feature on this thing is that the kids account is specifically set up so that your child  - who will most likely just press a bunch of buttons and tap all over the screen - can't accidentally exit out of their games or videos (I'm sure any mumma's who have let their kids use their phones know how annoying it can be to have to continuously fix the phone so it's actually on whatever game or video they're on). The handles are movable so they double as a stand which is also neat. We've had it since Xmas and so far it's proving to be very durable ( survived being thrown multiple times dropped and even stomped on) and it's also super cute. Definitely recommend this product it's a great first tablet!
5,Second touch screen I've bought for my almost two year old. This one by far is the best. Great picture and amazing battery life!
3,It's cute and all but the part I hate is that I can't lock the screen to where my little one can't turn the screen off completely with the lock button on the outside of the screen. She will be watching her show then grab it wrong and the screen cuts off because she pressed the screen lock button on the bottom. If I could put a parental lock to keep her from doing that I would love it more!
5,I like it
3,I love it for what it does but the response when touching the screen is horrible
5,The screen quality is really good for the size of the tablet and the battery life goes a long way for sure!! Couple days and still has battery life.
5,This tablet is a good size for small children. When it had a problem customer service staff took care of it immediately!
3,When we first got the product everything worked fine. Although I personally didn't care for the screen it would work for a toddler. We have had this tablet less than a year and while the battery life is AWESOME the overall product is seriously lacking! For example the volume buttons do not always work and that's with them being clean and free of toddler gunk. The touch screen...where do I start? The touch screen started off fine but then all of a sudden of the Draw app I noticed he couldn't color a draw a complete picture because the screen wasn't working towards the bottom of the tablet. Which made it so frustrating for my son to use when he wanted to change apps. Now the whole screen decides when it wants to work and when it does not. It's literally garbage now.
5,Everything was fine with the tables except the screen smh can’t put the tablet in adult mode because it asks for a pin can’t put the pin in if the middle of the screen stopped working.
5,Perfect for a 1 year old baby!
5,Very good buy. Has YouTube and every app a phone dose my baby girl loves it
5,Easy for him to hold (1 year old) Keeps him entertained
4,I bought 3 of these for my kids and they are great. Comes preloaded with education games and the parental controls were easy to use.
5,Very happy with this tablet- I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my 5 yr old.the casing is solid!! Making the tablet completely indestructible.Overall for the price I’m quite happy with it.It’s Packed with features! The graphics are bright and vivid. The Built-in games are perfect for His age. Tons of built in content. I love that I can monitor all of his time and activity.The battery life is absolutely amazing! we only have to charge it but once every 3 days or so.he never seems to get bored of it either.It's lightweight enough for him. The handles are the Perfect size for him.it also came beautifully packaged so it made for a terrific gift.Amazing price.
4,Las aplicaciones propias para niños pero su cargador lo recibí defectuoso difícil ser cargar energía tener mayor supervisión en los accesorios del producto
3,For the price is was a good purchase just a bit slow for some reason
2,the battery life on this tablet is TERRIBLE. it dies really fast and it takes forever to charge the touch screen works when it wants to and many of the games that I downloaded for my child freezes & closes out of the app. He has had this tablet for less than a week and we are already having these problems definitely wouldn’t recommend.
5,Good
4,The sound quality is kind of muffled
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Very cute tablet my kids love. It has a nice thick case with movable arms that make it easy to hold and double as a stand. It came with a screen protector which I thought was a nice bonus that is definitely a must. A tempered glass protector would be better but I wasn’t expected one so I pleased. It is easy to navigate and I appreciate the parental controls. The only down side is the battery life doesn’t last as long as expected but that doesn’t seem to bother my kids more so me for having to charge so often. I have tried other kids tablets and this one has a way better touch screen. It is also a low price so I didn’t mind the gamble for the kids.
4,I bought this for my niece as a Christmas gift! She loved it! It was easy to use ideal size easy to hold and resistant to drops. Had a quality issue a few weeks ago but the manufacturer was super hands on and resolve it fast.
2,Well when I saw the price of this and how cute it looks I thought this was a steal of a deal- Wrong. It’s just a steal of your money. The picture quality is pour sometimes the screen doesn’t respond right away to your touch and the battery life last as long as an icy in the summer heat. Just save (if you have to) and get your baby a good quality tablet and invest in great protection for it. That’s it!
2,It is most definitely a cheap android tablet the volume on it doesn’t even work anymore an the fact that when touching the screen it’s very hard to click on certain things at times I’m buying him an actualiPad or a better tablet worth the $ this isn’t just collecting dust
4,This little tablet has it all- its cute has a very protective case long battery life parental controls and it has a ton of videos games and activities all included many of which you do not need an internet connection for.My three year old loves the learning apps and now knows all about ants is getting better with numbers and colors. She actually is engaged  and learning. There are fun two player games and the little arms are supper helpful. I can add additional apps she enjoys and set limits on everything. Also this thing has been thrown more than a few times and it's held up to the abuse.This is a great buy!
4,This is a decent tablet for the price. Really easy to use. The babies know where all of their apps are! There are lots of toddler games. Mine stopped chargikg but Amazon replaced it super fast and we were back up and running. My 2 year old loves it!
5,A good tablet for my 2yr old. Even with the hitting it’s still good and she loves it. I recommend it.
5,He is on the spectrum and loves his games and movies. I got this for him so he would let me have my phone back. He loves it.
5,La tablet esta buena pero no tiene la mejor calidad en resolución de pantalla es un poco oscura la cámara es de baja resolución y calidad y a mi niño de 2 años le encanta tomar fotos y videos. Se pueden bajar las aplicaciones y juegos para niños de manera sencilla tiene control parental y el niño no puede bajar aplicaciones sin el permiso del adulto.
3,Okay so I'm only giving this tablet 3 stats because the returning was easy and I had no hassle and the money was given back the very same day. The tablet's case is really thin and it's hard plastic I've seen other tablets with soft thick rubber cases that are a lot more appropriatefortoddlers. I bought this for my 2 year old and there's no way it would've lasted. I had it less than a week and the sensor went out at the top of the screen which impeded navigation of apps and tablet itself. Another thing that was a bummer about the design is that the tablet's power and volume buttons were visible and accessible to the child. They're literally at the front of the tablet which of course my toddler would push resulting in me having to readjust the volume and opening locks lockscreen one too many times. Overall the concept is cute but the design is not practical.
5,This is a great tablet but after a few months it stopped powering up even after a full charge. Seller has graciously replaced it even after the 30 day manufacturer warranty was over and we also had a 2 year extended warranty by another company
2,the sound is very poor and barley can hear anything and if you hear it's jarring your ears.the touch screen not reacting soo well and the response time is very slow and I'm not talking about the poor screen.I would say that next time I will buy familiar company and spend a few more dollarsnot recommended at all
3,Loved that you could use google play but it is not easy to navigate the device. I bought 2. One lasted 2 weeks and then quit.... so they replaced it. Now both the first and the replacement ones have died and all within 2 months.
5,Do you have a toddler that will not sit down for 5 mins or doesn’t like to seat while you are driving this little tablet will be a life saver for you it is very kid friendly any toddler can figure it out awesome screen quality and great battery life you will not be disappointed
5,Enjoyed very much
3,Ok for a toddler but quality is low but she is happy to have her own tablet so mim is happy
4,We bought this for our 2 year old and he loves it!!!
4,I bought this tablet for my 2year old daughter she just used this for 3 months.now the touch screen not working.
4,Battery life is average which is okay.Screen quality is okay as well.It’s a pretty good tablet for kids
5,We got this small tablet for our daughter when she was 1 since she loves watching Coco Melon. The tablet works great and is the perfect size for her little hands. The arms are easy to grip and allow it to stand up on its own. Great to bring on long car trips as well and he battery lasts for hours. My daughter also loves discovering the different apps on there. This is a great way to entertain and teach her how to use technology!
4,The tablet is great but I did not receive the charging cord. It seems it won't take any type c cable either
5,What a wonderful tablet for my daughter. I got it for her first plane ride and she did amazing! It’s filled with educational games for her to enjoy.
4,I actually like this tablet quite a lot it comes with this cute little sturdy case my only thing is the case should not fit so sturdy onto the tablet to the point where you’re not able to swipe up and down the screen freely. That’s my only concern.
2,You're getting what you pay for but you'd be better off waiting for an Amazon Fire to go on sale. While the penguin cover is cute that's where the satisfaction ends. The application was sub par difficult to set up and glitchy. Touch screen was intermittently working long delays in responsiveness to touch.This caused more frustration than amusement for my daughter. So much so that we returned it. We now have the Fire 8 tablet and what a difference! Save yourself the hassle and disappointment don't buy this one.
4,I did not receive a power cord for this item. How am I suppose to charge it?
3,Bought 2 of them not even 2 weeks ago and already don't work. Both of them the touch screen quit working entirely. Same day. DO NOT BUY THIS! Spend the extra $30 and get something better!
3,Touch screen not all that accurate
2,At first the tablet worked fine for YouTube and Netflix. The camera quality is severely lacking but I brought it just to keep my toddler busy. After the first 6months issues with certains parts of the screen started occurring. Now we can't use the top or bottom of the screen only the middle. We can't turn it on and off we just have to wait until the battery runs out.
2,Get ready to buy another one screen stay frozen😒
3,I'm missing one of the accessories in the box says it brings the screen protector and it's not inside of the box
4,I bought this tablet for my 7 year old daughter's birthday to play educational games and watch movies. She was able to navigate it without any problems and really loves it.
2,I like the size and the case the tablet comes with. That’s about it. The ads are ridiculous even in the kid mode they pop up and if your kid presses on them it’ll take them to the App Store. The touchscreen isn’t sensitive so you have to press very hard to get the tablet to respond. Needless to say I’m either going to give it away or send it back.
5,My 2yr old loves it!
2,When I first got this tablet it work great until my daughter which is 2 spilled water on it but then I bought it again and the kids tv doesn’t work at all just keeps saying iwawa is in kids safe mode and is blocked and I’ve tried everything to get it to work so I had to download other kid tv programs for her and the screen sometimes takes long to respond to you touch
5,Buena calidad
5,My daughter loves this tablet and it avoids getting into fights with her brothers foe theirs. The apps are kid friendly and it supports majority of Google related apps like YouTube kids which is a big plus. The design is cute for the kids and they love carrying it by the handles/arms. Would highly recommend this compared to other more expensive options that are loaded with boat ware.
2,This tablet sucks. It is NOT sensitive enough and you have to click something multiple times. It's also very slow and doesn't always connect to the internet. I wish I had returned it and gotten a refund when I had the chance.
3,Not worth the money.My son hasn't played with it not even two months and it won't charge now  .The handles don't keep the tablet up any more. (Wore out)
4,My 2 year old LOVES his tablet! We constantly hear “Mine”. Battery life is only about 2hrs but he knows “mommy it’s dead I charge it”. Good for the money. Keeps him occupied in the car and other places where we are out and about.
4,Touch screen stopped working in only 3 months. Total trash don't waste your time or money.
5,Very nice product and my toddler absolutely loves it.If you ever have a problem their customer service team is friendly and responsive.!
2,Tablet freezes I’m returning product back.
2,Worked fine and then just stopped working. Charged and all not working anymore.
2,My son loved this tablet for the short time it did last. It is easy for toddlers to hold and use. Probably too easy because within the first 2 weeks he deleted the entire kid's profile (which turned it into a regular tablet with no parental controls) and I couldn't get it back.After that I would catch him using YouTube to listen to music but he's always monitored so it was not a huge deal.Then finally after 2.5 short months it won't turn on anymore and overheats whenever it's hooked up to a charger.Overall my son loved it while it lasted but the product itself is not good quality and I will be switching brands.
3,I ended up purchasing this for my LO because it was cheap....and it's just that. It works - we have games on it the battery lasts for maybe 6 hours continuous use I'd say (but not proven) the speakers are loud enough and so far my LO hasn't broken it yet...he's a bambam just FYI -> so it does the job just fine for people on a budget. My only tiff with it is that the screen sometimes doesn't respond and it can be a little slow...otherwise it does the job!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I was SO excited to receive this cute little tablet for my baby girl. We are getting ready for a trip and I needed a great distraction for my 19 month old. The shipping was quick and I received the product the very next day. I opened it and started it up. It is VERY easy and simple to use but you can tell the quality is generic and outdated. I didn’t mind that though. All we needed was YouTube Kids and we were able to download that particular app. So far the tablet has served its purpose.After a few hours though the tablets Lock Screen became unresponsive! It wasn’t until AFTER the tablet died that I was able to use it. The seller responded within a few hours but by then I had already returned it. I don’t need ANY tablet becoming unresponsive while on a 4 hour flight with a 19 month old!I hope this helps!
2,I don’t know what was worse the screen freezing up the touch would go out or the battery slow charging but dying fast.But this tablet sucks
2,It’s slower than Christmas bad quality can’t hardly do anything with it- cheap cheap cheap.
3,Battery life is good.  But it runs so slow thay it takes several minutes to get to anything.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is actually very kind friendly but it’s a bit hard to maneuver for a 2 year old there’s so much on it to do . I actually like it a lot so far even though some contents keeps turning off but for the most part it’s good for kids and it can be used for adults too when logged out of the IWAWA kids tablet !
3,6/12/21 - Had to change my review to three stars due to the fact that the wrong charging plug was included.  Even though I was able to call Amazon and get a resolution this should not have happened.  Be sure and check your package to see that the correct plug is included.this is the perfect tablet for our very busy and tough grand who tears up almost anything given to them.  it has the necessary kid features and will keep them occupied for the time allotted.
5,I purchased this for my granddaughter on her second birthday. We are very pleased with our purchase.
5,Wry nice tablet for the money the bendy arms are great for when we need to prop it up
4,Works well for easy distraction for a toddler.  Easy to hold and/or stand on it's own. And was easy to connect to bluetooth devices.
5,I love this tablet. I got it for my 3 year to download different learning games. I like that we can take it with us while we’re on the go to keep him busy. It’s a thinner one compared to his other tablet but it’s held up without breaking the screen or anything else on it considering it’s been dropped a few times. The battery last a couple days after it’s fully charged. I would recommend it.
5,My granddaughter has truley enjoyed this tablet. The touch screen is easy for her to navigate to all the apps that have been downloaded for her. From the alphabet to numbers to shapes and colors. She listens and follows what the app says. She is a talker now. She loves that she can sit or dance to it.Would purchase again.
5,I would not suggest this for a kid that uses their ipad alot. We have an older son that does and his 2 year old brother loves to watch him watch vidoes or play games so we got h his own to give it a try and not spend so much money incase it breaks. He loves it he watches Disney Plus and Netflix movies so its perfect for little kids. Very durable as well.
4,good toy
3,Works great but not my child proof...
4,Battery life bites
5,I like everything about it
5,Bought this for my baby as Holiday gift. She love it so much. Every time when she get into the car she wants to take it with her. There are a lot of activities that she can do: drawing learning the letters/numbers listen musics etc. It’s touch screen. The best thing we like is the handle actually can turn into a holder. Which we don’t have to hold it by hands.
2,Al mes de uso  el táctil de la pantalla no funcionó más es una tqblet muy frágil  ya no sirvió más para ser una tablet para uso de niños no tiene mayor protección no es aprueba de caídas
3,You get what you pay for.
1,Absolutely hate everything about it. Waste of money. Nothing at all like the advertisement. I bought this for my son but he doesn’t even play with it. There’s a glare over the entire screen. It moves very slowly even when it has a strong connection and on full power. Battery runs out very fast. It is overall poor quality and a waste of money. Wish I would have gotten a refund on it.
4,Very durable compared to other tablets he has had. It has been thrown and stepped on still works perfectly. I think it's a great buy for a toddler.
5,Like the way it stands up. Has some decent apps already on it. My nephew likes it ...3yrs old.
5,Long lasting great working
4,This tablet is honestly worth the money it’s cheap and durable. The battery life is pretty good the size is perfect for kids/toddlers. Their are great games stories and videos already downloaded onto tablet.It’s all easy access and it has great parental control.
4,This tablet great!!! Only thing is u have to have wifi in order to even used the installed games on there and everything else. Other then that it's great. Great grip for my toddler battery life is also great as well last a long time!!!
3,Customer service is great and really easy to deal no challenges at all
5,This tablet is fantastic. Simply fantastic! My kiddo absolutely love it.  Tablet operates quickly touchscreen is quite responsive and the memory is sufficient. The battery can last a long time.
4,Good kids content
5,Purchased for my 2 year old. It has a number of apps she can choose from easy for her to navigate.m and a TON of educational apps for her to learn. I also love the kids videos she can choose from as well. Perfect design. It’s just what she needed.
2,It looks really cheap! Instructions are soooo bad. Skin is attached to the tablet. Can’t take it out for cleaning or change it. Image quality is not too bad.
2,Lo que no me agrado ...  es lento para cargar las app por ejemplo YouTube  es muy lento para cargar videos
3,Tablet was good for about A month and then the sensitivity to touch did not work anymore.  Different Apps began popping up that weren't even touched
5,My 1 year old grandson can operate it. So much to do for fun and learning
3,I really don’t like this tablet. It’s slow and to me it’s not kid friendly. It allows pop ups in some of the apps. I wish I would’ve just bought another Fire tablet which is way better.
5,This is the 3rd table I bought for my granddaughter and it is the only one that has lasted more then a day Very durable fits easily in her little hands. Love the adjustable handles. Very easy to use.
4,Very age-appropriate. I like the parental control features. I had to buy a charger since the wrong charger was placed in the box. Value for money but the seller should check to ensure the charger match the tablet.
2,For the money I spent I was expecting better quality. This is the second one I’ve got the first one was defective. I bought for Christmas and sent it back because it was glitching. They replaced it . This one is defective to because it is already not working. Three month’s life time.
5,Easy to use for 2 year old.
4,i got it for my one and a half year old for her Netflix about a month after her using it the color went like bland on the screen still works perfectly though otherwise. definitely worth what I paid
4,Cute functional and has some cute learning apps.The operating system is a little slow but your not paying for an apple product.Good quality for the price.
5,It was a  great buy my toddler is a monster and the tablet is keeping up with him. Great battery life and the touch screen is fine. However the screen quality is not awesome but he's a toddler so it's ok.
3,The screen stop working on all three of the one I brought
1,This tablet is the absolute worse I can’t even get it to turn on at all and it’s crazy cause when I plug in the charger the charging icon pops up but it refuses to turn on still I have tried everything my son is really disappointed
5,Do not like
3,It's very cute and listed for a good price that's why we bought it vs $100 competitors.3 stars: you have to look at the screen directly or it's too light and hard to see.Also very slow. Baterry does last for a while but not as long as a phone battery.
2,I bought 2 of these tablets for my twins to use only in the car for peaceful car rides and at first I thought I got a good deal. I loved the settings for the kids. Tablets were perfect until they weren't!!! One of the bottom half of the screen stoped working then a few days later the charger port started to mess up and wouldnt charge. The charger ports are very delicate and break very easy. One of my tablets is hard for it to charge and the other wont charge at all the port got pushed all the way in. And whats a tablet if you can't charge it. I had to go out and buy another tablet from walmart.
1,We bought this for my 4 yr old in February 2022. We have tried since to put it on and use it it refused to come on. We thought we need to give it some more time to try to make it work. Now it's out of warranty and nothing makes it come on. Absolute waste
2,Touch screen stops working - doesn't navigate easily
1,I purchased the tablet in late 2021 but by March 2022 it needed to be replaced. The seller quickly shipped a new one which was appreciated however as of this month August 2022 the replacement is also no longer working. The screen isn't sensitive enough the response time is extremely slow (if at all) and it constantly disconnects from WiFi. I've already done a factory reset and have restarted it several times. My recommendation is to spend another $30 on a different tablet and get one that works.
2,I purchased for a 2 year old. He's only used it for a couple of moths. The touch screen failed. I have tried restarts and everything else. I gave it 2 stars because I have to take some responsibility for buying it.
1,I bought it for my baby so he can hear his favorite songs while I’m driving. He never got to touch it. One day I thought it went out of battery I plug it to the charger and never turn on again!
5,Very good tablet for kids good screen long life batery nice camera very fast working in one word The best !
5,Great product with all types of learning apps for toddlers I love this tablet for my one year old and they can learn till like 5 on this thing
5,Havent opened it its a present so not sure about how it works yet. But its cute
5,Customer Service is prompt and easy to reach if you have trouble with anything in regards to the tablet. This tablet is utilized often and my boys love it.
4,Battery life is very short for a child IPad
3,The tablet is suppose to be for toddlers but its not very durable for a younger child to use.
2,Este artículo en menos de dos meses dejó de funcionar lo que sí es muy bueno para los niños muy interactivo y aprenden mucho como tal si me encantó. La batería no duraban mucho y dejo de funcionar en menos de 2 meses de comorado
3,After a month or two the screen just randomly stopped working. My daughter only used it for watching videos a certain amount of time and under my supervision and she was really careful with it so I know she didn’t break anything but it was nice while it lasted.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I only had it since July  2 months and now it won’t even cut on. The battery last a little bit and the screen acts funny when you try and use it. My son ends up having a fit because it always gets stuck. DO NOT BUY
3,Hardly holds a charge. It could be completely charged 100%.I turn it back on and it's totally dead.Matter of fact.... It's ready broken. Can't do anything with it. It's junkOh it's super slow as well. 😑
5,Best tablet for kids good quality long battery lifeMy kids love it best purchase !!!
5,Has good battery life and easy to hold
5,The product is great my grandson loves it and does not want anyone to touch it! Lol
1,I dislike that it will not connect to any internet server ! The internet does not work  let alone the “kids movies” does not play due to it not connecting to any internet ! Honestly I am super disappointed in this  but my child is 1 so tapping the screen keeps him entertained for a little
1,It’s the perfect size for my 1 year old but it’s really nothing for her to do she can’t watch YouTube or anything on it even when it’s connected to wifi
2,Used for about a week they will on and off work with Wi-Fi sometimes itll connect other times it won’t very very spotty.
1,I have been a long time Amazon customer and I usually don’t write bad reviews but this deserves one. I decided to give the tablet the benefit of the doubt even though it is rated poorly. It is very cute and great for little hands. Unfortunately the tablet touchscreen stopped working after a few short months and is stuck so you can’t swipe up to get into the tablet. Basically if you buy this in a few short months YOU will be stuck with an unhappy child and an expensive paperweight. Please read the reviews before you buy this.
5,Thank you so much! I had an issue with the screen and the tablet was replaced with no issues and fast shipping.This product keeps my toddler busy and also comes with activities for learningI appreciate the tablet and the exceptional customer service
3,Expected the battery life to at least last 6 hours minimum  can hardly do 2 and A half but quality is there and my son loves it either way
2,I did not expect the screen quality to be so bad. Screen dims and brightens as you move your head like a hologram Pokémon card.
5,Bought this for my 2 year old daughter who tends to be on the destructive side sometimes (Terrible Two's) this tablet has taking a beating and it still works like the first day we opened up the package! It came with two screen protectors which was a bonus and she really loves it. the handles are great for carrying or using as a stand. In my opinion it's well worth the buy!
5,This is absolutely adorable. The battery life is decent. I had to figure out the 2 different modes for the tablet. Screen quality is amazing the cameras however succcccck but overall great product for the price and my 2 year old really loves the games on it.
5,No complaints
5,Great tablet for kids. Bought it for my 3yr old to use for our long car ride when we went on vacation. He can't get on any app I don't approve it has a ton of preloaded games & activities the case is super durable & easy to clean. The actual tablet itself is powered by Android & can be accessed by the parents to adjust settings as needed. Definitely Recommend!!!!
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               La pantalla no funciona toda
5,We’ve really enjoyed this tablet. The case provides a lot of protection and it has good battery life too. It’s easy to use and navigate and there are lots of games and apps to choose from. I like that you can set up a kid’s profile too. It’s a great price point we’ve tried more expensive things like the kids kindle but I feel like this has all the same benefits.
5,My kids love them
5,Its is a great product specially since it cost less than 60 dollar.I had my doubts before buying it but its better than the amazon or alexa tablet.very easy and fast to navigate internet and very easy for my 2year old to manage .in 3 days he already knows how to turn it on and volume up or down.you tube is really fast and doent freeze havent try the other features for kid but dis glance at it and the look great.
3,This product was amazing the first month. Then the battery life sucked it will be 100% charged and I’ll only lost 1 hour I wouldn’t recommend for long car rides :(
5,I love the battery life on the tablets. The screen is perfect for toddlers to use.
5,Mis nietas felices con su table muy bonitas
3,Seems like a tablet from 2009. But a one year old doesn’t notice the difference.
5,My granddaughter loves this
2,Very functional and easy to use for kids. Preloaded with kids favorites. I have had to do returns because the screen keeps malfunctioning.
2,Touch screen absolutely sucks. You have to do the same motion or tap the same thing like 5 times before it catches it or loads. It's SLOW and the contrast sucks. I would not recommend for the price you could get something so much better!! It does have some cute features but that's literally about it. If I could go back I would definitely choose something else.
5,This tablet is great for my child. The parental controls are excellent. I would recommend this to anyone with small children. After a small issue the service department was more than helpful and took care of me and my issue promptly and left me wholly satisfied. Great product!
5,My 2yr old grand daughter loves the apps and finds something new to watch and do every day. I like the parental control I have over it also. And when there was a technical issue with the tablet customer service was very quick to respond with a solution. I am very pleased with this purchase thank you!
1,I purchased one for my 3 YO then decided to purchase another for my 2 YO great niece before the first had arrived and tried out and regret the second purchase. My daughters arrived day two the power and volume buttons quit working. Replacement came and the touch sensitivity of the top of the screen did not work! Returned it for a refund and purchased the dragon touch kidzpad y88x7 that's $27 more but well worth it with more storage capacity 20 preinstalled disney ebooks Android 10.0 OS better front and rear camera more durable case and an included 2 year warranty which you don't get with this one! My great niece hasn't had any problems with hers yet however she hardly uses it so I'm considering returning it and purchasing her the dragon touch as well so I know she'll have a better tablet that's at least do covered under warranty beyond Amazon's 30 day guarantee!!**UPDATE HER POWER BUTTON ALSO QUIT WORKING SO I RETURNED IT FOR https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089DH5B6C?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share THIS TABLET BC THE DRAGON TOUCH WAS OUT OF STOCK & SO FAR BOTH ARE GREAT TABLETS!!
5,Had to have been a return even tho Amazon stated new. There were several old WiFi’s saved under settings and every now and then the tablet would take off as if it had a mind of its own. I often had to use a cell hot spot bc it would not connect to my home WiFi. Slow reactions. Returned for the kindle.
5,My daughter loves watching her coco melon and swiping learning games. Great for the car ride & love the stand great entertainment & learning for any age
1,This is pretty horrendous for the price. Way better off buying a Fire tablet or something else. Load times are fairly long and menus are jumbled unorganized. You need to download the games before if you plan on being offline.
5,Works great my little one loves his. Was actually more than what I expected for the price. Battery lasts for quite a while and you’re able to set a time limit. However the back button that rests at the bottom of the screen is no longer working but is no big deal.Update: ended up breaking very easily and switched to the kids fire tablet.
5,Great for toodlers definitely recommend !!
2,I’ve had this product for about 2 months now.My daughter didn’t like it and I didn’t like it either.The touch screen is difficult to deal with because you have to touch the screen several times in order for it to respondand sometimes it’ll just freeze and I have to turn it off and on again so it comes back to life lol.Also the volume buttons take a while to respond as well.
5,It really is a.deal for the price durable and my son loves it.
1,I bought this for my 1 year old as a jumpstart for learning programs as well as watch videos. The WiFi doesn’t connect but it connects to a phones hot spot every time I try to connect to my WiFi I enter my password it says connecting then saved but never actually connects.
2,Worked great for a day then barely held a charge for half a day. Screen doesn't respond almost at all with or without screen protector.
3,It worked really good for about a month my grandson loved it then it completely quit working
5,As described. Durable for toddlers 🦋👑👑👑
5,Buen producto y inversion
5,We haven’t had it a longer than 24 hrs yet so idk about The battery life but i loveeee this tablet so much for my son. it’s awesome it has variety of apps. i love the the kids tv app the most lol keeps my son very entertained and he loves that the handles can move. i do too
1,Product just stopped corporating after set up. Would not leave loading screen even after reseting and it even changed the password on us. Before we can give it too our daughter. Once it tried to connect and use all the functions it just couldn't keep up with the service now days. don't buy
5,My grandson loves his tablet.
1,Save your money. Do not buy. I ordered one. Worked for a week then stopped charging. Replacement came didn’t even turn in. Very cheap looking and doesn’t work
5,Sturdy enough for a 2yr old boy.
5,Great product and fast delivery
5,Toddler love it she's even learning her colors now just turned 2
5,Everything works properly.
1,This worked well enough for my 2 year old at restaurants and in the car. Unfortunately after just 6 months the touch screen stopped working completely. The device is now worthless and cannot be used.
2,it didn’t have good good screen sensor . you have to push the screen multiple times to get anywhere . it was a headache for me and my son
1,The screen doesn’t work on the tablet only used once and can’t get a refund for this item which is ridiculous
2,We've only had it for a couple weeks first time my son dropped it the screen broke.
5,The tablet is easy to use. The case is great to protect the product. Battery life could be better then it is. But its not horrible. I would buy this item again if needed. Easy to charge. Easy to set up for the children. Great learning games you can download on the tablet.
1,I bought this for my now 2 year old boy. About this on February and it’s been broken since May. It only last a couple month. The screen stop working. I know kids can be a mess. But I at least thought it was going to last a year.
5,My baby loves this soooo much. She usually watches coco melon on you tube TV on our big screen. Now she has her own portable tablet with touch screen and stand.  I can put in walker tray high chair tray. It's amazing!!!! Would buy again in a heartbeat.
1,Wouldn't let play videos or nothing says internet not hooked up. Tried at my house my daughter home same issue
2,My kid is 2 1/2and she loves it for like an hour because  the battery  dies fast
2,My 3 yr old grandson loved this little tablet and I loved the cuddles while he was using it.  Unfortunately 3 months later the screen has issues and stalls really bad.  The touch screen works at times but the back button does not work at all.  We have to power off by a hard boot by pressing the middle button and holding for 10 seconds.  This does not make a 3yr old very happy :(  Will there be a fix to this?
1,No funciona más no tiene ni un mes y ya no funciono
1,I like the case & it being all in one. Battery was ok. Screen froze wouldn’t move. Would have to restart to get screen from being stuck.
5,Great tablet! My son loves it. He takes it everywhere he goes. Has some built in apps for him to learn colors and shapes. Customer service is great! They helped me through out every step on the way. Highly recommend this tablet for little ones.
5,Great for the kids
2,Screen quality is poor touch screen barley works and my child wasn't even interested after just opening because of this.
1,I bought this tablet for my daughter. Only had it for a little over a month she dropped it by accident. Screen completely cracked... unusable. So I guess I'll be buying a different tablet.
2,The tablet is cool for a child 3 an under but it’s slow dies fast picture quality is bad But the design is cool tho
5,cumplió mis expectativas indicada para la bebe muy intuitiva y facil de usar.
1,Super slow and pixely. Do not but this! Shuts off on its own
2,The screen went out after 3 months of having it and its not cracked or anything just stopped working
5,The tablet has kept us busy. There are a lot of learning activities as well as the ability to download your favorites. The handles are great for a kid to hold and prop up. We have had a few tablets over the years and this has been my favorite case so far.
3,Battery life ok. Thickness and size for young children good but screen quality sucks and runs a little slow
3,Love the tablet hate that it didn’t come with the correct charger
1,We have been able to turn it on a handful of times. Now doesn’t even turn on
5,Me gusta mucho el diseño y la facilidad con que se maneja
5,I loved the quality of the pad. Easy to program and she started learning the first day she received it.
5,My 2 yo loves this tablet. She watches Netflix and plays the Montessori games that are already on it often! Would definitely recommend. Customer service was great and quickly replied when I had an issue.
5,It’s really easy to use and it’s affordable.
5,Muy bueno el producto pantalla suoer bien
2,The best thing about this tablet is the case I would’ve expected a better quality tablet but you get what you pay for .
2,La pantalla no quería funcionar en algunas ocasiones
3,Difficult to use for toddler only able to access you tube
5,It cute and drop proof
1,This product is mediocre at best it is poorly design and doesn’t work correctly. It is a pity that I have wasted my money on this inferior item. Giving this product a one star rating is very generous in light of the mediocrity that this product exemplifies. So word to the wise do not waste your money on this product or only if you would like a product that works for a few days.
5,My kid is In love with this tablet. It give such peace of mind to a parent that you can personalize the tab so as to ensure your child doesn’t see explicit contents.
2,This was great for a week. Then the touch screen on the top stopped working then the bottom stopped working then we couldn’t keep it charged.
5,I got 2 of these for my youngest kiddos and they love it. Easy to use and they are pretty sturdy. My 4 year old likes to throw his...
5,My little one loves this! I love that you can control exactly what apps they use. The battery lasts for hours of constant use and the touch screen responds really well to little fingers. Its all in all a great value for the price.
5,Some of the reviews are not good on this product. Will have to wait an see.
5,My daughter said this was better than expected.
3,I loved it while it worked. Had it for less than a month and the touch screen quit working on it.
2,My daughter loved it while it lasted. The screen stopped working after a few months.
5,great for my little one
1,I got this for my two year old to keep him occupied with down time...it stopped working within 2wks!! I wouldn't stay charged and he would have to use it on the charger (that's not going to work with a busy 2yr old) and soon after that it stopped working ON THE CHARGER!! Was better off going to the store and buying one which I did and he has been happy every since soo🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
2,At first it seems very good for the kids but after we received the product and  after starting the tablet it run soo slow 🐌  its like some old gadget  that needs some  updating and whatnot.
2,The touch screen gave out. You cant type in the numbers
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I got it for my 2 year old he doesn't seem interested in tablets yet. I only want it for lullabies videos and stuff like that. seems to be the perfect tablet I'm happy I didn't got an expensive tablet this one works perfect.
5,This was a gift for my great niece. She loves it.
5,I love it for my daughter she loves touching on the screen and everything you can get Netflix and any other apps on there it’s also a Parent control password on there that’s really helpful.
1,No me agrado  muy malaCalidad
1,Also this no even take internet connection really bad product
1,DON'T CONNECT
2,Es dinero desperdiciado en una mala inversión compre dos de ellas para mi hija y otra para mi hijo y es la peor que he comprado 1 mes de uso y ya no sirve la pantalla táctil es basura se queda frisada y no marcas lo que quieres escribir sido algo loco.
5,It's easy for my daughter to use she like the little handles it had and the battery life is pretty good as well definitely buy it
1,Don’t Stay charged for long and when It was charging it never charged over 13%
1,I don’t like it didt last 3 months for a little baby
5,Very durable faster than I expected will actually play videos without stopping to download. Has a lot of features and has been educational for my Grandson.
5,Compré esta tableta para mi bebé de 5 meses le gusta ver la película del grinch 😬😊al parecer la conforta cuando está inquieta  también la uso fuera de casa de verdad la recomiendo la calidad es exelente y el precio es muy razonable
2,After like the first 3 uses the battery doesn't hold a charge. Instead of you setting the parental controls it has them majorly preset which doesn't give access to the right kid apps and videos. You also have to go through a lot to add an app or even just approve of YouTube kids.
5,Buena calidad
1,When I first recieved the tablet I was having trouble with it connecting to my wifi. If it disconnected at all it took hours for it to reconnect. I managed to work with that. However the screen stopped working for no reason at all. I have tried my best to fix it but nothing is working. I noticed that it was having issues a few days before it stopped completely. I'm very upset. This was my daughter's Christmas present and I don't have the money to buy her another one. I thought that this tablet would be perfect for her but it's very cheaply made.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               La duración de la batería es muy buena..! Dura todo el dia
5,My 2 year old has destroyed two tablets thus far he already dropped this one multiple times and not a scratch couldn't ask for more protection.
5,Perfect for my little one. She loves it!
2,I really liked this tablet for my toddler but a week later the screen stopped working. I got a replacement but the screen on that one also stopped working. Wouldve been worth the money if the tablet screen wasnt so faulty.
1,I returned it the same day I received it! It had another kid’s information already in it meaning it wasn’t new but used. It also would not connect to the internet.
1,Don’t buy this tablet for your kids i brought this tablet for my toddler and after a week went by it froze can’t log in can’t do nothing with it and mind you I brought this tablet last year 2021 no answer to customer service so now I have this broken new tablet just sitting here
1,Small screen  battery life sucks and it’s not super easy for a toddler to operate
5,I love this and so does my daughter. It's perfect for her to grow with and is built to last.
2,Great quality and easy to use. 2nd review didn’t last long. Not even a full year later and I can’t get it to turn on. 😡
2,Got the tablet.  My son used it just for car rides. Purchased in July and it has already stopped charging.  Changed the charger and still won't charge. Not a great deal.
1,Very disappointed… I got this device for a gift for my granddaughter we got it and charged it she used it came over again to charge it and it has never charged again we have tried many different chargers with no results so I tried reaching out to Amazon and to the seller but at this moment no one has contacted me back
5,I love the handles my one year old is able to hold onto the tablet and watch coco melon! Love it.
2,The power and volume buttons are not working. It's only been open 1 wk
5,Pensé que no me gustaría luego de pedirla pero me encanta es súper útil mi niño le encanta la recomiendo 100%
1,Stop working after 5 months and return policy sucks..30 days..never again second tablet from Amazon.
5,The quality of the camera is dark you can’t take pictures and videos
5,The bottom half of the screen doesn’t work so you can’t tap it to go back. I have to keep resetting it to be back on the main screen...
1,The first one I ordered worked fine for the first 3 days then the bottom half of the screen stopped working. Looked like it was fine but stopped responding to touch. I ordered a replacement and sent back the first one. The second one worked for 2 hours. TWO HOURS BEFORE THE ENTIRE SCREEN STOPPED RESPONDING TO TOUCH. Do not recommend unless you’re just looking for a mad kid and extra hassle.
1,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and today is only New Year’s Eve and the tablet is broken. When you first get it the touch screen is already slow honestly. It wouldn’t connect to my hotspot at first. I was just having a lot of trouble with it. But why I’m writing this review is because I dropped it last night ONCE. Screen protector and case on and the tablet is broken. Every time you plug it in it got those lines on the screen.. Don’t waste your time
2,Returned it after tablet store working 3 weeks after we got it. Someone else was already registered in the pad so I got a used iPad.
2,Purchased March 20 2021. After mild toddler  use (less than 1-2 hours a day) daily charging and care half the screen no longer works on June 23 2021. Purchased Amazon Fire 8 tablet for same price seems much higher quality.
2,The tablet runs very slow when my daughter tries to play games. She really only uses it to watch her shows on youtube which is great if thats what you're looking for. The battery lasts longer if you power it off after each session. Otherwise it'll drain fast if left on.
5,It does a lot of things you will enjoy it
1,Received on April 6th and it quit charging on July 17th and it no longer works.  Not worth the money.
1,Do not recommend
2,Wish I could give it a five star but the top half of the screen stopped responding to touch other than that it's not a bad tablet. Battery life and apps are great for my two year old.
2,We thought this was the same tablet we had before but it is NOT! We have to constantly restart it in hopes that’ll reset the system. The tablet freezes constantly and you can’t do anything with it. Really disappointed
5,I am happy with my purchase and the features of this tablet surpassed my expectations.
1,Bad quality it broke without use
1,The quality of the picture was aww DHL and battery life is terrible.
5,Timing was GREAT
5,I brought this for my granddaughter so she can watch the wiggles she loves it
1,Didn’t last a week. Purchased for my 2 year old and the screen stopped working after one week.
1,The application run time is ridiculous. Waste of money.
5,perfect for the little one
2,Well you get what you pay for! Buyer’s remorse is alive and well. I should have spent more money and gotten a better product. The screen developed a green hue and fades to blue after having it only a couple weeks. I’m totally disappointed.
2,For a toddler tablet you have to push really hard on the screen for it to work battery last maybe 30 minutes
1,Already broken and it’s only been like 4 months. Just doesn’t turn on.
2,The tablet doesn’t stay charged for long at all.. We can get a good 2 hours then it goes dead
1,The touch screen freezes alot sometimes you have to shut it off to even clear the screen. The touch on the screen is all messed up it runs very slow and I have really good internet so it’s not because of that.. all in all it’s a junk tablet… I don’t recommend at all. I usually never have anything bad to say about my Amazon’s orders but this one I do…. Sorry not sorry 🤷‍♀️
1,Would not recommend this product. To start with it isn’t easy to navigate. It takes a long time to boot up and the battery doesn’t last very long at all. More importantly after less than 4 months of owning it the touch screen has malfunctioned. We are unable to navigate out of apps. We only use this on occasion for road trips and particular circumstances so we shouldn’t be having issues like this so soon. I’m very unhappy with this purchase.
2,Bought for my toddler. After the first week the volume and power buttons did not respond as well (had to push them harder) now tablet won't turn on though it's charged. It seems like the power button doesn't work anymore.
1,We did like that it fits our toddlers hands but the screen response is horrible you may have to rap it 20 times to respond. And it runs slow. It freezes up a lot. I returned it to Amazon.
2,Hard to use touch screen
1,Got it for his bday Feb 11th. N it’s only the begging of April n it’s already have problems with slowing down n freezing it’s crazy n top the screen lcd broke in one spot it was good before bed woke up took off charger and it was broke. I’m battery sucks.
1,Was really upset with the quality touch screen only works if you jam your finger onto the screen and the loading time between clicking an app for it to load or to turn on is ridiculous. With the Hollidays and everything going on I missed the return window so now I’m at an 80 dollar loss and still need to just go get an IPad I guess for my daughter
1,Ordered this and literally after a month it just stopped working and there was nothing Amazon can do for me
2,my 2yr old granddaughter loved this she would watch for hrs. Then one day after only couple months stopped working. cat return now and she did nothing to it
1,My grandson had his tablet for 3 days and dropped it and it broke the screen and now it doesn’t work at all!!! I would not recommend this to anyone!!!!
5,I hate it battery dies lol
2,Bad quality.
5,Muy buena compra
1,Bought this for my grandson because it was supposed to be durable and age appropriate. After 4 months of daily use the touch is no longer functioning except to swipe and even it’s delayed. Not pleased at all and I do not recommend it.
1,Screen doesn't always work very hard to press tablet freezing for up to 30min before able to use again I bought it for my daughter for her birthday Nov 2nd and she loved carrying it around with her.item looks cute not a good buy though very annoying that the parent lock pops up every time you press an app with the tablet freezing very inconvenient  last up to 2 days clear picture but hard to press buttons
1,Didn’t last long at all
5,My son loves it  the learning games that are included are great
2,Meant for kids purchased for my 3 year old. Didn’t last a month super hard to setup and now parts of the screen don’t work
5,My grandson who is 3 1/2 loved learning from this tablet.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             My daughter really like it and the battery is very good for her to watch her show for very long hours.
1,Wont turn on after one week of use
1,Super outdated the picture screen especially with the camera is terrible. Difficulty downloading apps that I wanted. Battery went dead quickly. I was looking just for something simple and introductory for my toddler and this failed. The pre-downloaded apps were terrible
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Worked perfectly fine yesterday now it’s not doing anything. The battery and screen life are excellent but the durability is awful
2,For the most part it works as expected. The touch screen doesn't always work so you have to swipe a few times before it unlocks.
1,Very bad product I got this for my daughter this touch screen is bad glitches a lot load very slow I had it for two weeks my daughter used it once while I held it in my hand weeks later I won’t even turn on
2,The tablet was difficult for my daughter to use because the touch screen was not so responsive to touch. It eventually stopped responding to touch at all.
1,I purchased the first tablet and it stop working the screen just will freeze.  I got a replacement for it and it is doing the same thing.  My grand baby just love it and I am not sure what's to do. I bought a blue and a pink one. The blue seem to work ok it's just the pink one. Any suggestions.  Please help.
1,Charging cord quit working in less than a month and unable to find a compatible charger cord so as great as the tablet is when the battery is dead and unable to recharge it’s money thrown away!
1,Worked fine for a few weeks then the touch screen function stopped responding to anything. Tried finger stylus removing screen protector etc. Nothing works. Tried power cycle still doesn't work. Powers off and on with power button but you can't do anything because the touch screen doesn't work. Don't waste your money or time.
1,Product is a great size screen is as expected even came with a screen protector film. It seem sturdy...This tablet is nice if you don't want to use it to watch videos. The videos take an extremely long time to load and then when they do load it's very poor quality. It's very frustrating. My son used it only one day...
1,The battery life is great. The pictures and Quality was good but after a week my sons touch screen stopped working where we couldn’t even get into the tablet anymore we tried hard resetting it and still didn't work. Again I bought 2 1 still currently running other one is garbage. So it’s 50/50 for now 🤷🏻‍♂️
1,Very disappointed with this purchase. I purchased 2 of these tablets.After only 2 months. They were both glitching and now the touch screen doesn't even work. And I can't even send them back. Very Very disappointed. And my kids were so excited with them
5,A good gift for toddlers but not that friendly like apple software
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT!! I BOUGHT FOR MY NIECE (21months)SHE LOVES IT
1,We bought this tablet for our child. We got it today. My husband was able to download one app and was about to download a second app when the tablet stopped working. The screen doesn't recognize it's being touched. Returning it today.
5,Regalo de cumple para mi hijo
1,Worst thing I’ve ever bought my poor son didn’t even get to use it every time he clicked the screen it would go black this was a waste of money
1,Brought this tablet for my son for Christmas and within a month the screen went out first the power button then the screen. A WASTE OF MONEY!! Now I have to order another kind hopefully this one is better!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 i just got this from you and the touch screen doesn't work in top part
5,My daughter likes this
5,This is an amazing gift for my neice
5,Perfect
1,Dislike
2,Broke after a month. Not very durable for small kids. Go with another brand.
1,Screen keeps crashing whenever I open apps and also random parts of the tablet do not work. For the parts that do work everything you touch will open even if you’re just scrolling and all of this is happening with it coming right out of the box.
1,This is supposed to be toddler friendly and not break easily but my one year old dropped it a few times and now we can’t get passed the passcode to enjoy it
1,THIS ITEM NEVER WOULD CHARGE COMPLETELY FROM THE DAY I OPENED IT. THE BATTERY DIED VERY QUICKLY AND WITHIN 2 DAYS OF MINIMUM USE THE TOUCH SCREEN QUIT WORKING AND COULD NO LONGER BE USED  AT ALL
1,Usually I don't rate but for this product I will it froze as soon as we turn it on the screen it keeps on crashing down the apps don't work after u download them its a nightmare for any parent your lil one will keep on crying not worth it its a trash
5,I would recommend my 1yr old loves it
5,Great for learning school children.
1,This tablet is horrible. I bought one the screen broke within 5 days and had a giant black mark on it. So I returned it and got a new one. The replacement one also broke within a week the touch screen wouldn’t work whatsoever. So now I bought a Kindle. Don’t waste your money on this product !!!!
1,I had to have the tablet replaced due to the screen not working. When you touched one area it would register in another area. I am having the exact issue with the replacement tablet. Overall I would not recommend for anyone to purchase!
1,I am very unhappy with my purchase I think they erase these reviews but this tablet is very slow my son gets very frustrated because takes time to download the apps and the handles broke off very quickly and just the lighting is not that great. I don't like giving bad reviews but I need to be honest maybe they can make it a better product.
1,The tablet is cute but it lasted only a week. The battery died and after that it wouldn't turn on. I charged it for several days on different chargers it still wouldn't turn on. I didn't get much time with it so can't really comment on anything else I returned the device.
1,Tablets are very cheaply made for their price! The moment I got them I instantly regretted not getting the Amazon fire tablets! It took what seemed like forever to add the Internet as well. I definitely won’t be recommending this to no one!!
5,Great works well my son loves it
1,Screen is to bright even if i adjust to a night screen and lower the brightness the touch screen sometimes doesn’t work this was in the first day 3rd day touchscreen stoped working.Really bad product but is what i get for trying to save money
5,My son loves it
1,If i could do NO STARS I would . I have two of the same tablets because they had to send me another one because the first one just stop working within a week or so. The second one they sent works better than the first but it’s still don’t work  you have to keep pressing the buttons . Would not recommend to anyone
1,This product is terrible. It didn’t allow you to move on the screen even though it is supposed to be touch screen. It gets hot when it’s left on and burned my child. Now they will not give me a refund only credit.
1,El producto llegó sin el. Cargador solo el cable llego sucia la tableta el táctil no funciona URGENTE  o me retornan el dinero y les entrego esto pero me responden que falta de. Respeto de verdad necesito contacto con el proveedor ya....
1,The buttons stopped working after a few days of light use. First you couldn’t change the volume then you couldn’t power it on or off. I had to plug in into the charger to get the screen to turn on once it turned black.
5,Easy to use. My grandson is 2 and enjoys playing with it.
1,This tablet literally only lasted for 2 days. From day one the Touchscreen features were acting funny now I can't even press the screen to go to other features because it does not work no matter how hard or soft you press the screen. Don't recommend this for anyone  what a waste of money.
5,Great product my twins love it it’s awesome
5,Very durable!
1,The tablet doesn’t work it keeps force closing since I first got it my son did not like it
1,Don’t not order this literally ordered it on July 26 2021 and as of today September 14 it does not work at all. I am definitely very disappointed with this purchase please do not waste your money on this. For 70 bucks for it to only work for two months yeah never again.
5,My granddaughter loves the tablet. It's very durable as well.
2,Lower part of screen stopped working after a month or so.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I have only had this for a month my son has only used this three or four times while I am supervising him. Today when I tried turning it on for him it keeps powering off whenever I load an application. I was hoping this tablet would last longer then this 🥺
1,I’ve only had this “tablet” for a week and it’s already giving me trouble. It glitches for such a long time until it dies I read the reviews when it was too late so I will be returning
1,Save your money or invest in something a little more expensive. We opened the box turned on the device made sure it was fully charged then clicked on one of the learning apps. About 15 seconds in the device just shut off. We turned it back on and repeated the process several times. It keeps shutting off. The processor is slow and it lags whenever we click on something. Just really disappointing.
1,It’s glitching a lot and made my kid very mad.I didn’t like it either my kid
1,Very disappointed with this product. i just purchased this in mid July and as of September 24th it no longer works. It has been well taken care of and only used maybe 2 times a week and the touch screen is no longer working. Very upsetting.
5,The battery dies really FAST
1,Bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter 3 days after use the top and bottom of the screen stopped working. Have to turn the damn thing all the way off to switch apps. I’d give it zero stars if I could. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1,Device stopped working after a month. Screen kept freezing up and bottom and top portion completely stopped working. Waste of money
2,The touch screen will stop working on the tablet
5,The media could not be loaded.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I usually don't do reviews I mean if I do their good reviews I couldn't wait to review this product like I said I'm very disappointed it's slow I have good internet in the home no bueno thumbs down sorry
2,Very very slow!.. power button should be in a different place.
5,3yr old twinz
1,Bought and it worked for about a month requested a replacement and got one but the replacement only worked for a short period as well about 2 weeks then broke again
5,I love it..
1,Didn’t have maybe 3 weeks an it stoped workingAll it was used for was for my two year old daughter to watch Netflix on.
1,The tablet is definitely made for a child but the screen to my sons tablet went out almost immediately. The tablet itself takes forever to charge when I was able to use it definitely not fond of it.
1,Not a good product! The screen kept getting frozen and the battery stop taking charge after a few days of buying it
1,If you have a child who likes to watch videos this tablet won’t even last a month. Powered off to charge has never came back on again used it for 3 weeks.
1,This table is not good it stop working after 1 week from me giving to my son screen stop work had to get a whole different Tablet
1,Battery life is awful
1,This product is SO BAD. Firstly it takes forever to charge ( about a whole day for a full charge) it’s so slow and the lag in literally insane. Super poor quality. A total waste of money in my opinion.
1,Not good didn't work at all
1,Bought this for my son for Christmas. Used a handful of times and won’t turn on again. Needless to say I’m pretty pissed off to be out $70 on a piece of garbage.
1,Es muy bonita pero parece un juguete la cámara malísima y la pantalla solo funcionó 2 semanas y se quedó frisada dinero tirado a la basura no lo compren
1,I Was so excited to get this tablet for my 4yo but after just ine day of use the screen stopped responding. Going  to see how customer service works out
1,Touch screen has a major delay in touch effects. Everything I click on lags before playing . Waste of money !!!!
5,nice my son love it
1,I ordered one for my 1 year old daughter.  I had to send it back for a replacement as it would not power on. About 1 week later after receiving the replacement the screen went blank! It was just a waste of money for me.
1,Don't have any battery time to it. Dies fast.
1,Don’t waste your money!!! Terrible terrible product. Very disappointed.. Bought it for my 3 year old. (Never dropped) Only have had it for 2 months.  After a couple weeks it Kept freezing then suddenly half the screen went black/white with strikes.
1,We have taken care of it and suddenly screen is frozen.heard from others that its happened to them.i regret this purchase my granddaughter loved it.
1,It doesn't even work anymore I brought it for my granddaughter's birthday and it stopped birthday and it's not working 2 days later
1,Only worked long enough to exceed the return window.  It wouldn't turn on or take charge. When it did work it wouldn't connect to wifi and was hard to navigate through without.  Definitely don't recommend.
1,For the price you would expect something that actually works. Instead you get something that doesnt register touch worth a damn.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I get issues going on since I got it after first week I didn’t able to use it both tablets
1,Bought this tablet for my son and it worked for about an hour and then the touch screen stopped working. You play a game and within 30 seconds the touch screen stops working. Extremely frustrating. Don’t buy!
1,Bought so my daughter could watch movies and have games to play but it won’t connect to my hotspot.
1,Eat bonita y adecuada para un bebe pero no me gusto porque no agarra el wifi no la recomiendo
1,You can't pull the screen down to turn on wifi it just goes right back up. Same thing with trying to close apps. Its a piece of crap and waste of money!
1,This is not a good purchase. My daughter is 1 1/2 and she play with it twice and now the batter light comes on continuously requesting to be charged. Now will not come on at all. Don’t buy!
1,This is a cute tablet. It seems durable for a one year old. However I am unable to log into Google because the keyboard doesn’t work.
1,Do not spend your money buying this tablet the screen freezes and the touch screen does not work well it takes time to return to the other page I do not recommend this product!
1,Realmente no fue lo que esperaba! Fue un regalo para mi sobrina y a los 3 meses dejó de funcionar sencillamente nunca más prendió
1,Ordered this for Christmas and the touchscreen stopped working after 2 days so I exchanged it. The second one stopped working after 2 weeks. Same issue.
1,Tablet never held a very good charge even if I kept wifi off lasted about 3 months before it stopped charging or turning on at all. Ran very slowly. Frustrated and disappointed with this purchase.
1,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and less than 2 months it won't stay on. Waste of money for this product.
1,It lags horribly something you don’t notice until you start to load some apps for you child.  Do not purchase. Waste of money
1,Didn’t like it my toddler doesn’t like it at all
1,I dislike that I paid a high amount for a faulty product. Run do not buy from this seller as they don't care.
1,From the first day the battery just discharges quickly. It was easy to setup and use.
1,HORRIBLE
1,The touch screen started glitching about a month or so after purchasing the tablet...I can't access some of the apps because part of the screen doesn't work!
1,No tiren su dinero a la basura
1,Stopped working and haven't had it a month yet. Became stuck in camera mode and screen resolution was off. Now can't open up apps. I need my money back!!!
1,Hard time connecting to WiFi you have to be inches away for it to connect . Battery life is trash overall I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone at all.
1,Don’t get this tablet it stopped working shortly after getting it
1,La pantalla touch se daño luego de un día de uso
1,I just brought it for my 2 years old son last week it wont keep charge not even for 2 hours.  I'm in process of returning it. so disappointed.
1,No me agrado para nada no duro  y lla no quiere cargar no prende no ase nada
1,My daughter took it out of kidd mode and now it is set up like and android and I can not figure out how to put it back. I even tried googling it. 🙄 also it lags like crazy
1,Died after 4 months
1,I did not like it at all my it’s not working I did buy it but n may and it June ... and my Toddler is sad because it’s not working any more I waste my money
1,Shows it is charged 100% but will not turn on used it properly 3 times
3,So the software runs like it's from the early 2000s. It does everything you want it to for your toddler just slower. Apps function I can download Bimi Boo parents controls are great the case is durable an cute the predownloaded games and apps on it are awesome. I haven't tried playing a movie on it yet. It's been in use for a month with 4-5 days a week in use. Lots of drops and no cracked screens. Solid first electronic for kids.
1,Started running very slow and than touch screen stopped working. Of course this happened AFTER the cutoff date to be able to return it. A flippin waste of money!!!!
1,Nothing works.
1,My son had this toy for 3 months and the screen is already unresponsive and it’s no damage to the screen ! Would not recommend
1,Screen has error stating the back of pad is open. There is no way to clear or fix it
1,I returned the 1st one due to the touch screen malfunction. The battery life is low. The second one I received won't keep charge. It's garbage.
1,Not a month old and will not hold a charge. Ticks me off that it wont work after one month
1,The tablet would not turn on. I have to send it back. I purchased it for my 2year old's Christmas!
1,First picture is the one we got on xmas the touch  screen broke in a 3 weeks. Then we got to return for another and its brooke before 2 weeks. Not sure if you can even return it a second time.
1,Didn't know a tablet could be so crappy. Takes forever to do anything. Don't buy
1,It's a paper weight now
1,My daughter got this for Christmas and it has already stopped working twice. The screen won’t let us slide it up to open it. It was replaced once and now is doing it again a month after the replacement came in.
1,Just didn’t do what we needed it to do so we returned it
1,It stopped working in a week I asked for the item to be resent and I ship this one back I’m still waiting for a response it stopped working 3 days after buying
1,It’s so slow. And you need to be connected to wifi even with the pre-loaded games and videos. We bought it for traveling and it’s absolutely workless.
1,Bought in April quit working in August Since it was for my classroom we didn’t even use it over the summer. So basically used it for a month.
1,Great for the value but the battery don't last long and the touch in a week stop working. So don't waist your time and money on this.
1,The screen is grainy and the battery doesn't last long. Also the interface is questionable as it looks like malware.

4,Keeps turning itself all the way off when not plugged in. Doesn’t matter how charged it is. My son is getting mad about it. He is two years old. He never dropped it but otherwise a very good tablet
1,the same day I arrive it is ruined it only worked for 1 hour the screen went all black and no longer works

5,My two-year old grandson loves his table!
1,Missing charger
5,This tablet was a birthday gift for my 4 year old daughter in September of 2021 thereby providing me with about 9 months of first-hand knowledge and just in case it might help any other parents I thought I would share my honest and neutral review.  I am a single father of a 4 year old daughter with Autism Spectrum Disorder whom absolutely loves playing and learning with this tablet that has turned out to be perhaps one of the best educational investments I have made for her.  As a result I would not hesitate to purchase this tablet again as I am very happy with the price as it has proven to be invaluable for my daughter's learning and development confidence and overall happiness.  Since day one she can't seem to get enough of just the preinstalled learning apps on the tablet that have kept her completely engaged for as long as I'm willing to let her use it before making her take a break.  Additionally I was truly impressed and overwhelmed with joy as to how quickly she was able to learn how to navigate the menu thereby easily and quickly finding her favorite apps & games adjusting the volume and especially learning how to play her favorite games on the tablet.  Of course it is very easy to simply go to the play store to download more educational kids games but there are more than plenty of preinstalled educational games to keep her busy.  Furthermore I was totally blown away with a renewed sense of confidence in her ability to learn new skills while watching her quickly master matching shapes colors and different sizes (i.e. small to large) with the preinstalled educational games.  In fact I wasn't even aware that she possessed these skills until learning and displaying them on the tablet.  Regarding durability this is one tough tablet. The penguin case is very tough and is more than enough protection from drops etc.  Perhaps my favorite feature besides the fact that this thing boasts a very efficient quad core processor is the penguin case arms because they are perfect for my daughter to comfortably hold or use to stand it up. Finally the only thing I can say that I might change if I could is the overall length of time it takes to charge the tablet's battery as it does kind of seem to take a long time. That being said however the tablet's long running time more than makes up for it.
2,Alright I admit I'm not the most tech savvy person for sure but I thought this would be fairly easy to setup & down load some apps to keep my 4 year old  entertained and maybe even teach her some things along the way. Pros: long battery life nice size clear screen. Cons: too complicated to navigate tried to get out of one game & go to another & no matter what button we pushed it was "stuck" on that one & we couldn't go forward or backwards had to shut it down & start over too many ads! Plus she doesn't like the handles at all which I thought would be a big plus. We finally got so frustrated she put it back in the box and said I don't want it. (You know it had to be annoying for a kid to do that).
5,Olvide la contraseña para padres como la reinicio
1,No da imagen
1,Don’t buy. My daughter received as a birthday gift. this is the second tablet and it doesn’t hold a charge and now has completely stopped working. I sent the first one back for the same reason.
1,worst tablet ever
1,This product is a waste of money.. Not connecting to wifi. Can not get certain apps downloaded.
1,Son dropped it one time and this is the outcome....smh
5,He loves it!! Thank u
5,My Grandson love his tablet!! Great battery life and he has no trouble operating the tablet!!
1,Screen stopped working after 3 months of use. Buttons work and screen will power up but touch doesn’t work at all. Battery dies fast. Received as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.
5,The case wasn't strong enough
1,This tablet is not really for toddlers. It looks like it but it does not perform like it. The sçreen is horrible it keeps glitching and it does not hold a good charge. I want to send it back. It is horrible.
1,This is not very user friendly.  There isn’t a manual other than a sheet that address 5 things and there are no videos online.
3,Battery life does not live up to the 7 hours as expected. I have to carry a charger for my child everywhere we go. Screen quality is very low and is not very visible with sunlight reflection. For a little more money I could’ve ordered a much better tablet but I was attracted to the design which turned out to be  hard plastic and not durable.
1,My mother got this for my 3 year old for Christmas. It was cute while it worked. It didn’t even last a month from Christmas though. The screen no longer recognizes touch. It turns on and it says unlocked but it will not do anything. My toddler only used it every couple days for a few hours at a time. For the price it should’ve lasted longer than a month! Big waste of money.
1,We were very excited for a family friend to give this to our toddler for Christmas (less than a month ago at the time of this writing.) She was able to use it for all of 4 days and the screen suddenly stopped working. The display is still there but the touch just doesn't work. She hadn't been rough with it...no spills drops or anything else to cause damage. I've tried everything to get it working and nothing. Would absolutely not recommend. 0/10.
1,My daughter grandmother got it for her 2 days ago and she is only 1 just to keep her entertain and to get her off of our phones she act lile she is in her terrible two and is very destructive 1st day  fine 2nd after it been thrown n etc screen is black on part of it tho we thought it was childproof its not way to east to break
1,bought this for my grand daughter late Aug for a xmas gift. She got it for xmas and used it for two weeks and happen to drop it on the carpeted living room carpet and the screen cracked. I wrote into the manufacture and explained what happened and never got a responce back from them. Wont be buying from them again.
1,Basically it let us put a Wi-Fi password in it screen froze wouldn’t let you get into the kid at parent app nothing died charged it still won’t work contacted Amazon to start a refund process lady tells me I need to send it in before they can refund me my money back in the process could take up to two weeks overall looks nice screens a little smaller but just didn’t work
5,Great customer service had an issue they solved it exceeded and went above and beyond to make it right. Bought this at a gift for my nephew he enjoys the tablet very much.
1,I wouldn’t waste your money on this tablet. My daughter played on it probably a total of 5 times and now it won’t even turn on or charge. I wasted my money. Will never by another tablet under this brand again.
5,I bought this for my friend’s 3 years old kid. They like it so much and his kid use it right away when he open the box. It’s a very decent table with this low budget price. It has all functions a toddler tablets should have. Parents control tough shell bright screen fun UI and pre-intalled apps especially a cute outline. Kits do like it! His kid used it for a week now and I didn’t hear any complaints about it.In general I really recommend it to you if you having a kid or want to buy a gift for kid this is a good one.
5,This was a great starter tablet for my 4 year old. She is in speech therapy so she uses it to do her zooms with her speech therapist. It works overall great. Definitely recommend to those looking for a kid safe tablet that van be maintained with parental controls.
5,Love it. Preloaded games videos etc for the child. Once you figure out the parent control part which wasn't easy you can add any apps on there you want and switch it back to child mode. Handles are Bendable so they can hold it at different angles.
2,This thing is so small that u can hardly see it not nothing like they say buyers beware
5,The screen quality was fair but it works for my 2yo granddaughter who loves watching Garfield.
4,Tablet is good for toddlers. It is android so has access to the android store. Slow to start up and move between apps but once in an app no problem.
5,My daughter loves this tablet. Battery life is fantastic and the handles are very strong. You are able to install apps from Google play and enable it inside the secure launcher.
5,Muy buena calidad para el precio que tiene
4,My toddler really enjoys this! The design and handles are easy to carry and it’s user friendly.
3,Decepcionada de mi inversión
1,I bought this because of the unique kids design. This was super cute and my almost two year old daughter loved having her own tablet to watch “her show.” Loved it for all of three days before the tablet completely stopped working.Don’t waste your money. Go with the trusted product line we all know by name. It will be returned and I’ll just end up getting a kindle.
1,la tablet despues de un mes de  uso a dejado de funcionar su pantalla no responde estoy desilusionado
5,My daughter loved her tablet up until it stopped working but the customer service team is helping me resolve this issue the customer service was very professional and easy to deal with
5,Bueno
5,Bought for my nephew he is absolutely thrilled to have his own tablet
4,The handle broke easily.
5,This tablet is suitable for young children. Easy to use and dependable. The arms can be used as a stand. The parental controls are effective to keep mature content out. Touch screen is responsive. The only drawback is the battery life can be better. It lasts maybe 3-4 hours with medium usage. Decent tablet overall for kids.
1,Half of the scree6works and half don't...I tried to restart it but the screen is not working so I can't even restart it..I am so disappointed I really wanted to like this kids tablet
5,Long battery life screen works fast my son loves it
2,I like the case it is perfect for my little ones hands don’t care for the tablet it’s self much. Very slow and hard to navigate going to different games and things.. battery doesn’t stay charged long!I’ve had for 2months now and my daughter accidentally threw up on it and now the screen is messed up and no longer lets me click on anything! Now I’m out money and tablet! 😭
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Not the best. I didn’t want to invest a lot of money on a kids tablet so I went with this. It worked great at the beginning but it slowly has gone downhill. The battery drains fast. The touch screen won’t let you go “home” or “back” or chose any option at the top or bottom of the screen. It’s been freezing up more and more lately so I’m constantly having to restart it to get it to work. Other than that 3 stars because at least my child is able to watch videos sometimes to keep her entertained.
5,So far so good
5,was delivered fast! Amazing quality.
5,Great product for value!
5,Easy to use  that my 1 year old grandson knows how to work it and battery life is good and great for me price.
4,Love it other than i wish it had a mic port. Didnt see it didnt have one so thats a bummer
5,A few things stand out for me about this tablet.It comes pre-setup with a kids profile.  That makes it easy and made me feel better about handing this to my 2 year old right out of the box.Also it charges fast.  50% in under an hour and is great because my kid isn’t happy when it’s not charged !Downloading apps is easy just like on a regular tablet.Overall great for young kids.  The case helps protect it from dropping too!
3,Bought this for our little grandson so he'd have his own tablet and frankly if I could I would send it back and just have bought him his own Kindle and downloaded Google Play onto it. The screen is not very responsive and he is constantly getting frustrated with it. The majority of the games pre-loaded are not really toddler games but more geared to Pre-school/Kindergarten age. I wish manufacturers would learn the difference between toddler and pre-school age. The case is great but overall if I had the box it came in I'd send it back.
5,my child loves the buttons on the front perfect size for smaller children love the parental control app and pretty durable the screen does get weird if it’s dirty like it won’t pick up you trying to do stuff but once cleaned it works fine my child is obsessed
4,my toddler loves this! he had used it so much one handle got worn out and broke off but he doesn't seem to care.
4,Great tablet for little ones. my 1yr old has learned quickly how to use it. downside is if the battery does not have a great life especially watching the pre loaded videos. upside it charges really quick.
1,I tried to reset reboot and more and the item screen would not work so I’m getting a refund don’t give people trash when they pay money for your items
5,I'm not sure. My nephew is using it.
5,The arms move so you can sit the tablet up graphics are good so many learning games and restricting apps is easy! Great purchase definitely recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought it for our son on his birthday ! It looks sturdy and has good battery life! It has lots of learning games which are very helpful! It is worth buying for kids learning!
1,Broken in about a month. My toddler had this tablet for a little over a month dropped it a twice  time and then stepped on it and it broke completely useless.
4,First off I just want to say this tablet is made in China. The video quality isn’t that great. The sound is not five stars. For a toddler I think it’s decent. I will definitely update to something better as my child gets older.
1,It was cheap made and froze up
5,Unfortunately my display went out the day after I got it 😭 however it acts just like a real tablet. Offers kid mode too. Cute and ergonomical
5,Got it for my 3 year old son to watch YouTube on. I love how the parental controls also let's you control the volume and lock it in place! Was worth every penny so far.
5,perfecta
5,My baby loves his tablet ❤️
2,The volume and power button stopped working after a month.
5,This tablet is so easy to use my one year old could stay and watch educational programs without the habit of pushing buttons like on my I pad the pinguen look adorable. My son loves it’s he can hold his own table with the little handles.
1,Bought this as a gift for My daughter for her birthday only for it to not work ! Very disappointed! Thought I wasn’t going to have any issues but I was wrong. Do not waste your money on this !
1,It’s freaking terrible
5,super cute great value
5,Brought this for my 3 year old along with some headphones and let’s just say I didn’t hear a word out of him for the entire day 😂I have brought my son bigger tablets but for some reason he likes smaller screens better so I got this 1
5,The ease of the games the learning tools are so much fun for the kids!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My mind before getting this tablet: Your child does not need another tablet. WELP I was wrong because as soon as I thought that one of her other ones started to glitch and die. Came fast and the penguin is not only the case but also build into the tablet so no kids taking it off. The arms of the penguin move to be able to sit it up which is fantastic because ever other stand has broken on my daughters tablets but I don't think it's possible for her to break these ones. She's fascinated with the way it looks and so far it's running smoothly. Type C cord is used to charge it which usually means that it has quality charging with the newest technology.  I don't use the standard app on kids tablets because it's a little too restrictive on what I want to teach my daughter and google play has a lot of amazing free games for kids. I will always choose a droid tablet like this over an apple one especially because of that amazing price.
5,This was a replacement from the first one I bought this works great my grandson's mom got it set up and she played with it. She said this is a great tablet for a 2yr old.
5,Mi pequeño amo la tablet muchas gracias al vendedor
5,
5,I was able to download Netflix and download all episodes of coco melon for offline play in long car rides with my toddler. Works like a charm and the little grab handles and built on case for the tablet is perfect for his little destructive hands lol
1,No good i got it damaged
2,Bought this last of January and it started not working properly. Seller not responding to emails
5,I have been in market looking for a tablet for my two year old that has a lot more learning activities then just watching shows. This tablet was perfect. The I stalled games are very informative and it works amazing. There are some shows such as masha and the bear that have episodes but my focus is on the games. Battery life could have been better as it dies out fast. Other then that it is very light weight and easy to use
1,Got this for my grandson for his birthday on may but now it don't want to charge just after a few weeks that we got it it just stop charging very disappointed 😞☹️
5,Nos encanto
1,Battery will not stay charge not at all stays hot and screen is already not wanting to work!
5,My 16 month old daughter absolutely loves this tablet!
5,Great for my 1 year old. It even connects to YouTube so she can watch Cocomelon! Great buy!
3,It wasn't the best. It kinda glitches after a week after my kids were using it. The screen kinda died off and on. Thought it was broken for a second. The battery life wasn't that good. Overall bought it for my toddler and it's okay.
5,Aight so. Bought this for my 3 year old son. This thing had been thrown more times than I can count. It's been stomped on  peed on  rained on  and submerged in a bathtub. I have no idea how it is still fully functional. The screen is cracked due to him slamming it on the floor over and over. It charges fast and the charge lasts forever! By far the best tablet I've ever spent my money on.
5,Love it for my twins
1,It stopped working after 3 weeks I could not change my Wi-Fi connection I could not pull it down and look at my emails it also had a parental code that I did not set on the tablet and stop working and would not charge or turn on the do not buy this I am so upset that I wasted my money
1,Had too many technical issues. Initially I thought it was me but it happened too many times where I would push buttons and nothing would happen so I had to keep restarting. My daughter spilled her bottle on it and not even a minute later there was milk inside the screen. I should have bought an Amazon tablet like I did for my oldest but I thought this would be sufficient for a 1 year old…proved me wrong
5,It works great and the stand is amazing.
5,Very good
2,It was good for the month that it was purchased  now  it won’t connect to the Wi-Fi so it’s useless now  it was a two month use 💯
5,Love it my kids love them as well and got here on time.😍😍
1,I brought this tablet for my toddler and when I first got it it worked and I was soo happy. Two weeks went by and this tablet will not say a word. I had it on the charger for two days and it will not turn on! Only thing worked was YouTube for kids! I will not buy this tablet again. Now I’m stuck with a tablet that does not work!! Any suggestions on a Great Tablet for Toddlers ?
5,Buena inversion
5,Fast delivery great deal for kids easy to use.
4,Easy for my 4 year old to use. She loved the design. It last a good days worth of use before having to be recharged. The screens quality is good it’s not the best but there’s no blur and it doesn’t hurt the eyes which is nice. I sat and used it for a bit lol. The touch screen has some lag but nothing to hate over. Overall a great product
5,This tablet is great for my 2-year-old. He quickly learned how to navigate the apps. The case is sturdy and the handles are great so he’s not accidentally touching the touch screen.
1,My son has disabilities and cannot move like most kids so I got this tablet for him when we travel to appts. That's all we have used it for and I just got it a lil over a month ago. It has been freezing non stop. At first it was manageable but now it barely lets me touch on the screen. He only uses it for YouTube when we go to appts. As much as I paid for it and the fact we barely use it it should work better than that. I love how it looks and the handles help keep it up in the car but the tablet does not work right. And it dies so fast also. It's says return window closed. Please just give me a refund so I can get one for my kid. He needs a tablet that works. This one can barely play YouTube most of the time.
5,My two years lives it. I love that we can download apps to do different things and how it comes pre loaded with other things to do
5,I really enjoy watching my daughter learn. I do not allow her to be on it for more than an hour at a time so the battery lasts for a long time. I love the fact that she can not get into the grown up section. NO MORE UNWANTED PURCHASES 😌
5,When I first read the reviews on the tablet I was nervous BUT I was wrong. This tablet is great for little kids. I have a 3 year old and he loves the tablet. The sound is great quality. The battery does die fast but it doesn’t take long to fully charge back up. I really love the fact it came with a screen protector! I also love the handles they even twist if you need them too without breaking off! Best investment for my 3 year old!
5,My two sons;age 1 and 3 years old use these in the car and for grocery shopping. Love that it has handles and a "kids screen" that keeps them on the apps or screens that are safe. Customer service has been good and quick to respond and fix any problems.
5,The calibration on the screen is off tried to fix it could fix it but overall best to ever for two-year-old
5,I bought this tablet for my toddler and the tablet is great ! Battery last so long and a lot of people are saying it’s very laggy  and it is. I don’t find that an issue since it’s a $60 tablet and well is it for kids not for adults. I kind of like that it’s laggy  makes a bit harder for my daughter to move it constantly to different apps which is what I wanted .
5,I bought a different one before it was a piece of poop and the vendor was to. This one is very good
5,My three years old toddler liked her birthday gift. She started to use it by herself very quickly. I like the timing control feature and it is safe to leave it with her. The charger stays long time.
5,It was worth the price
3,You get what you pay for. Overall quality wasn't good but the kid friendly/safety features were alright.
5,Real nice
5,Very cute design.
