5,We needed a better camera and mic system for a conference room with a 12 foot by 6 foot center table. This unit's lens picks up the entire space and the zoom feature allowed us to narrow the view to just the people at the table. The camera can also pan and zoom in and out using the included wireless remote. Mic picks up well and the remote mic allowed us to hear people at the far end of the table. No issues with the camera focusing on the space. Image on the monitor is very clear using a USB 2.0 cable. Built in speakers aren't great (sound is flat/hollow) but are the same quality as the television speakers we had been using for conferences so no loss there. Product definitely met our needs.
3,Positives:Great soundGreat microphonesNice form factorNegatives:Video Quality:The factory optical focal length was a very poor choice. It's such a wide viewing angle that it seems made for really just being 1 person sitting about 3 feet directly in front of it. If you have it in a conference room you'll find everyone is "small". You can zoom in using the supplied remote but this is digital zoom and so the picture quality is then TERRIBLE.4K is nearly impossible to get working. The small print on this being "4K" is that it doesn't come with a USB 3 cable that supports 4k it only comes with a USB 2 cable. I then bought and tried a USB 3 cable (but without an official one that is guaranteed to work) the one i choose didn't. Not to mention software support for 4k is very poor. (That part isn't Logitech's fault)So if you are looking for a very expensive personal video conference unit for JUST you and not a business setting than this is actually a great product. Otherwise i would pass.
4,I've used this in the past in a larger room setting and found it quite useful. With the pandemic I bought one for Zoom meetings in a much smaller setting at home. The microphone of course works superb and the camera does a great job of being able to zoom in to alleviate side background clutter but when it does so it loses clarity and the picture becomes blurry/grainy to the others in the meeting in speaker view when the picture on the screen is by itself and large. In gallery view when it's small it seems to be fine. It's also great to be able to "throw" the picture to the tv instead of the much smaller laptop view.
2,I have a small conference room that seats 7 people around an oval table.  I wanted to upgrade my existing logitech c920 camera and Jabra 510 to a more robust system. I was attracted to this product because of the purported higher quality voice and video  and the simplicity of an all-in-one unit.  Unfortunately the camera wouldn’t focus beyond a fixed focal point of about 3 feet.  I don’t know if this was a defect with the product or simply beyond the capability of the auto focus ability.  I went to the trouble of creating a login through Logitech’s support site including the very painful extraction of the barely readable unit serial number of the product only to have my trouble ticket ignored.  The fortunate thing is that I bought this unit Prime and that I’ll be dropping it back in the box for what will be a very expensive reverse logistics process for both my former colleagues at Amazon Retail and hopefully Logitech.  All the while the return will cost me nothing since Amazon obsesses over customers (as it should) and I’ll be able to order another product which will hopefully work as advertised i.e. does auto focus.  Now the happy news for both Amazon and Logitech is that (a) I’m actually going to try the Logitech Group product which I understand has a better camera and (b) I’m going to order through Amazon Prime which will guarantee if there are any problems with my new option I can quickly return it. It’s a win-win for everyone since I’m trusting Logitech  (again) who totally ignored my customer service request AND I’m continuing to spend tens of thousands with Amazon because they protect me from companies who choose not to provide customer service like Logitech.  Perhaps this review will provoke the dreaded “?” from jeff@ to some unsuspecting VP and a fire drill will result at an upcoming Monday WBR.  But at least I’ll get the satisfaction of helping Amazon raise the bar on its trusted vendors to obsess dare I say *focus* on my video conference room problem.
4,We placed this system in  a medium sized conference room (roughly 15x25' so I also got the extension mic.  The field of view is excellent the images from the cameral are also excellent and the microphone while slightly hollow is clear and easily understood even from the back of the room.  The zoom/pan controls work as advertised and we have yet to find a piece of videoconferencing software it doesn't work perfectly with.  You will have to attach it to a PC of some sort we used a fanless micro PC installed under the counter.  For some reason they made this thing look like it has stereo speakers: this is untrue it has a single though quite acceptable speaker though we use the speakers on the display as they are superior.  All in all would certainly buy again.
4,Professional use in the office. Easy to install. Works with all today's conferencing apps. Good value for money.
5,Easy to use super quality. The camera was plug and play on the Mac. I use it with Zoom conference services. Purchased this model for the expanded field of view.The expansion Mic is awesome. Sound reception is incredible (almost too good left the conference room for a private conversation and the mic picked up the conversation for all the online meeting participants to hear) I only wish it had a longer cord. The connection is micro usb and i have been unable to find a compatible extension.
1,HelpVideo on screen is yellow.Who do I call?
5,This camera made my virtual meeting more easier. Excellent quality of sound and video resolution. It really deserves its price.
4,Good quality and all but still the price point is pretty steep.
