5,There is very little to say about this little Asus Bluetooth adapter.  It is bluetooth 5.0 I plugged it in an open usb 3 slot on the back of my computer windows identified it immediately configured it and it was working boom done.  I didn't even need to search for a better driver.How has it worked?  I used a blue tooth headset from 40 feet away and there was no loss of reception or call quality.  I used a blue tooth controller from 10 feet away to game I felt nothing different than normal wireless.  Good enough for me.If you need a bluetooth usb adapter that simply works period with no muss no fuss this is it.  It even comes from a reasonably respected brand that actually will have at least some kind of customer support and warranty.  If you need it buy it.
5,My previous USB Bluetooth dongle was only slightly cheaper than this one but it kept losing connection all the time or my input lag would suddenly spike and that would cause my controller to do really funky things like endless moving my character around or doing actions that I didn't press at all. This one has zero connectivity issues and I haven't noticed any serious input lag or weird inputs. So as far as I'm concerned this product works perfectly and was worth the extra money.
5,Bought after struggling with PCIE WIFI Bluetooth adapters whenever I tried connecting audio that way it would connect however the audio would cut in/out and sounded HORRIBLE.This little guy (BT500) was literally plug in visit the manufactures website for drivers and it connected instantly! Only oddity I've encountered so far is the microphone works with BING yet isn't detected when using Google Search Engine. Audio quality is top notch though! (Range roughly 30ft)
5,Very easy to install and used it for headphones. Had ordered a TP-Link before that had serious issues this had none of those.
5,I bought this ASUS bluetooth adaptor to replace the ZEXMTE dongle which broke down less than a year.  Installation of the adaptor is super easy.  Although it is wonderfully small it works fine!  In short I love this product.
5,I have this usb dongle plugged in on front USB Port i use it to connect my Google pixel buds 2 and my Samsung Buds Pro 2 headsets to listen to Youtube podcasts and even on my Video Conference Meetings. Works very well. Super easy setup with plug and play
4,I have no BLE devices to test this with but with Sony WF-1000XM4 headphones xbox/8bitdo controllers cell phones and everything else the range is slightly better than what it was with an Intel AC 9260 wifi/bluetooth card in a pcie adapter. I get a solid 40ft or so. Before (with the Intel card/pcie adapter) I could be 5ft away and i'd experience dropouts in audio or controllers would go off on their own.Installation is easy just make sure to download the actual ASUS drivers. It makes a difference. Overall i'm happy. I just wish the range were a bit better. I've got the dongle in a USB extension and that helps a lot.
5,Bought this for my pc because it didnt came with bluetooth and it does its job i can listen to music with my airpods or other bluetooth devices
5,Simple easy and works great
5,El alcance es bueno
4,Install was fairly easy But the range is limited and i use Bose headphones But it works if your computer didn't come with blue-tooth.
5,Was highly rated. Had no issues using the product.
5,I'm not a Pc Guy Honestly. I was terrified putting in a new power supply on my pc when it went out and even then I needed someones help to troubleshoot what I messed up (turns out I used the wrong cable of a joint part and it prevented booting all is good now). So when I was looking to improve my Bluetooth quality I saw my built in one was Waaaaaaay past its prime so I looked around and saw ASUS had a 5.0 model knowing they are a well known PC parts distributor I took the dive and was ready to jump through hoops to get it done. But everything in the box explained anything I needed help with. Disable the previous Bluetooth device download our drivers from the exact site give the pc a reset afterwards and boom its all setAnd the results?My Bluetooth earbuds (Raycon Gaming Earbuds to be exact) Never once cut out mid game my old device would occasionally just lose audio and wouldn't let me focus completely on the game but now its completely seemless and would let me completely make a switch to a all wireless set up with my Audio.TLDR: Amazing produce for those who wanna get a means of using Bluetooth Audio or Devices to work
5,I purchased two of these because I needed one quickly and saw it available as same day the day after I purchased it with 2-day shipping. So I have one in a desktop and one in a laptop with an old wireless card / no bluetooth.No issues. I plug in enable bluetooth and can hook up my bluetooth speakers & headset (Anker products) though obviously not at the same time.I'm running Mint 20 (Based on Ubuntu 20.04) with KDE Plasma desktop on both.  I did have a problem ( I think) with a kernel update recently where I couldn't connect but after booting to the previous kernel and running updates the problem didn't resurface. I shut down my main machine nightly and have only had to do that once.As for range I really don't have a spacious environment but I do notice that my headphones will sometimes cut out at about 20' though it's running low to the ground through multiple walls appliances and cupboards. There's also horrendous 2.4Ghz noise where I live.  I don't have this problem with my Soundcore Motion+ speaker.Simple and excellent little devices.
5,Bought this to pair my buds to my PC; worked immediately with no hassle (other than drive install). Have managed to use it unintentionally for other products down the line. Solid price good build quality easy to use. Love asus.
5,Running two Debian/Ubuntu distros -- no issues whatsoever with either and no software installation(s) required.  I can't ask more from a computing device than that it just does its job no muss no fuss.I would buy again if I needed and I'd definitely recommend to friends&family.
4,Easy to install and gives you what you need.
3,I got this for my Bluetooth headphones. The connection is great UNTIL.... if I don't use any Bluetooth device for a couple days this device will stop responding and connecting to devices. It'll say connected but won't actually be connected. I have to go into device manager uninstall it then scan for new hardware and viola it works! Updating drivers did not help. I was blaming my headphones but they work perfectly with my phone and it's been happening with other BT devices now too. I think ASUS makes good products overall but I'm not too impressed with this one. 3 stars because once it does connect it works like a champ.
5,May randomly collapse into mono requiring reinstallation of drivers. This could by my own windows installation problem or motherboard driver issue but it solves the problem.
5,Plugged into a laptop immediately recognized and set up. Easy and reliable.
4,Works fine within 20 feet from my experience.
5,Works well w/ Ubuntu. Paired well w/ AS18 X2. Installed automatically paired instantly
5,Works perfectly. Does not drop or lag even from 10m away
5,no delay or any known issue
4,My previous Bluetooth adapter wasn’t very great so I figured I would just be stuck with wires. However I decided to try one more time and shoot for a better quality one and it was a great choice! I played Elden ring with it yesterday on my Switch Pro Controller and the inputs had no noticeable delay and it felt completely like it was wired in terms of latency. This Bluetooth adapter got me through a boss fight with absolutely no delay in latency. If you want a great Bluetooth adapter this is a great choice!Update: Used it some more today and it did lag a bit which was annoying. It must just be something with Nintendo handling other devices because it’s never happened with my switch. That and I have to reconnect the device myself every time I use it. So I think I may just stick to wired to eliminate delay.
5,Easy to use plug-n-Play works with all my peripherals and cost effective.
5,Used in the office works well arrived on time and well packaged.
5,Worked great for pairing PS5/DualSense controllers.I have it plugged into an extention cable and resting near the back of my keyboard and the extension runs directly to my PC/motherboard and works amazing.
4,The device works exactly as you expect. Its a convenient small easy to use device to add a bluetooth function to your pc. My only issue is the range is very limited! even when in range it works 95% of the time. Occasionally you will feel a disconnect on your controller or on your headset. Aside fromThat it works well!
5,Tried with my phone ear buds didn't work but worked with another set I had just fine.
4,I could no longer turn on the bluetooth on my HP Windows 10 desktop computer. I ordered this item based on price and the brand and I'm glad I did. I downloaded the latest driver as recommended in the manual plugged the device in and it worked right away.I initially had it plugged in in the back of the computer but the range was less than 15 feet. I changed that to using an extension cable so it sits on my desk and I'm easily getting 30 feet. It might be longer but that's as far as I've tested.One minor complaint is the plastic cap came off when I pulled it from the first placement but it snapped back into place easily.Highly recommended.
5,Windows 10 immediately recognized and installed correct driver.  All devices (kybd mouse headphones) work perfectly.
3,If you're not pretty good with Linux don't bother trying to get this to work with Linux. I spent several hours tinkering and screwed things up enough to require a reinstallation of my Linux distro. I know it's not entirely the fault of the manufacturer but it would be nice if they just said it's a big pain to use on Linux. I've had lousy luck with all things ASUS and this is no exception.
4,I'm running Ubuntu 22.04 and at first when trying this adapter I was using Ubuntu 20.04 I called tech support to help to get it working and was told he knows nothing about linux so I should Google It. Seems that Support does not understand that Linux is advertised to support. After upgrading to 22.04 it was detected and works. You'll need to enable over amplifcation in bluetooth settings. Almost returned but now that it works all is good. Please train your Tech Specialists better!
5,Plug in and go basically. It works well but range is pretty limited beyond 10 meters which I think is advertised.
5,I've had this thing for about a year now and have never had any driver issues with this thing and that's very common with other bluetooth adapters. Great signal quality and strength. If this one for any reason got lost or destroyed I'd purchase it again. Definitely worth it.
5,I own a set of Bose NC700 headphones and I wanted to experience better call quality with Microsoft Teams than I got using the built-in Intel Bluetooth adapter in my laptop running Windows 11. This adapter was easy to install after disabling my built-in Bluetooth using current drivers from ASUS’ website. The quality of my voice in Teams is vastly improved using this adapter so it solved the problem I wanted to tackle. P.S. I bought this adapter with my own money; this is not a paid review.
5,I can say this USB-BT500 Bluetooth adapter required nothing more than unpacking plugging it in and letting it do it's thing.My system is an older HP laptop with Windows 10 OS and no internal Bluetooth. Windows recognized a new device and the Bluetooth adapter began to download & install the drivers - installation complete. The final step - Windows allowed me to pair and connect with a Samsung phone and I was successfully transferring documents from computer to phone. ASUS makes really good products and this is no different.FYI - I read the quick install guide that came with the device prior to plugging it in because I don't like to assume or take shortcuts that ultimately waste time due to operator error. I can say this device really would require nothing more than unpacking plugging it in and letting it do it's install thing on its own.
4,It's been pretty solid. My previous Bluetooth device would just constantly disconnect and be just very problematic. The Asus bt500 has been great and I haven't had the same problematic issues I've had with the previous device.
5,Works great and was very simple to install
4,Sound quality is excellent however being a gamer the mic cuts in and out. So don't plan on people in your party chat to hear you clearly when you have your bluetooth headset connected.
5,I am so happy with this purchase.  I use to not be able to go to far upstairs before getting cutouts.  With this adapter I can go anywhere in my house and even to my mailbox.  That's signal penetration through two interior walls and an exterior wall and a distance of 50 meters!  Very pleased.
2,First of all when I ordered it they took nearly 5X as long to deliver it as they promised.  Then the package arrived damaged.  I had to download special software to get it to work.  It often refuses to connect on the first try.  I would not recommend buying this product.The good things:They do a great job of blocking outside sound.  You can still hear when somebody wants to bother you.The sound quality is adequate.  They're not good for music by any stretch of the imagination.  But they'll handle games and youtube well enough.I wear glasses.  They are very comfortable with glasses.  In fact it's not hard to forget you have one in.  Two you can tell but just one in and you can lose track of it.The battery in the buds is good for about 7 hours.  Nothing special but the claim of fast recharging is indeed true.  You can do a full 10 hour day without much issue.  Hint:  charge the buds while you take a shit on company time.Overall they're adequate.  Not great.  Not good.  But I own two pair so make of that what you will.
5,set itself up instantly.  Has worked without incident since going into service.what more can you ask?
5,I am happy to know that this is one of the best Bluetooth adapters for PC as of today. Very sleek and low-profile design doesn't take up much room at all and it's super easy to set up. Most def a 5/5 purchase
5,After struggling endlessly with built-in motherboard BT chips I caved and bought this USB dongle. It works pretty much flawlessly with my airpods for both audio and mic and allows me to switch between my desktop laptop and phone with a click. Well worth the $20.
5,I have a Windows 10 Home computer and the drivers installed instantly no manual installation it worked flawlessly from the start the directions were clear and concise and works amazing for my bluetooth speaker!
5,Easy way to add bluetooth to a PC.
5,Struggled for a long time with an off-brand bluetooth dongle I bought some time ago. Always had driver issues and problems pairing with my devices so I searched and searched and finally found this product (not sold in my country) and ordered it. Pluged it and worked like a charm a dream come true.10/10 would recommend specially if you've already had problems with other dongles on windows 10.Charmer ahead
5,Great Bluetooth dongle my second one from asus. 1st one is still working just kinda out dated as its Bluetooth gen 3 I think replaced it with this and no issues works great!
5,When your laptop is way past its prime and you just wanted to be able to print without plugging all the cables this gadget came to the rescue breathing new life to my laptop!
4,Works great so far. Zero issues.
5,It's great. My onboard one kept dropping my controller and my wireless headphones. I got one because they're pretty pricy just to check. I can stay connected from across the house through floors. So I went out and got 3 more and now all our computers laptops and work laptops have them.
3,Windows update took care of the problem before I got it.
5,Cumple en la medida de lo posible no tan bueno como una board con BT pero cumple su función habia comprado la versión anterior 4.0 BT de Asus tambien pero fallaba horrible compre este y la mejora es abismal. El alcance no es mucho si hay muros de por medio por ahi unos 3 metros con paredes pero alcanzo a ir hasta la otra habitación sin que se desconecte del todo aunque haya algo de interferencia. No creo encontrar uno mejor entonces no me puedo quejar
5,Works for Wireless headphones which is what I got it for.Makes it so that your computer can detect other Bluetooth devices like your phone controllers (not the Xbox ones cause those have their own coded Bluetooth adapter as seen in picture "left") speakers drawing tables mices keyboards etc...With headphones the audio quality depends on how good the headphone's receptor is. (Usually for good quality Bluetooth headphones you're going to have to buy some expensive headphones).Obviously cable is ALWAYS better for sound quality no matter how expensive your headphones are but if you have any Bluetooth headphones they will work with this Asus adapter and from what I've experienced in my apartment I can walk halfway through it before I lose connection.I have access to roughly 4 other rooms before I lose connection. So the distance is pretty good.
5,I use this product to give my pc bluetooth capability
5,I used this to pair my non Bluetooth computer with my AirPods and it works perfect! Range is about 25 feet or so before connection gets a little spotty but no complaints. I tried one from a different company first but got static in the background. Easy set up as well. Just plug in and search for device.
5,I bought this adapter for my windows 10 laptop that doesn't have bluetooth so I could use my wireless galaxy buds. All I had to do was plug in straight from the package and my computer had bluetooth! Connection is stable and audio sounds great!
5,Easy just plug it in. No issues since i have installed it and the drivers download automatically.
5,I had issues with my onboard PC bluetooth not being recognized (common issue with Gigabyte b550i). I am using windows 10 and this works well with my Xbox One controller. I was hesitant because another reviwerer had issues with this version's compatibility and they recommended the previous version. I had no such issue. All worked right away the moment plugged in. It's been a few months and it still works as supposed to. In case it helps I typically use my bluetooth device roughly 10-12 feet away so I cannot vouch for further distance.
5,It worked with no problem on my GNU/Linux hardware. That is all I can ask for.
5,Got this to give me more bluetooth range for my earphones.  I use a pc and the bluetooth would cut out at times.  disabled my intel bluetooth on pc installed this set it up and I can leave the room go to the other end of the house ( big house )  and I still get clear sound on my earbuds no cut out.  This thing really works...
1,There are devices within a couple feet of it that do not show up.  I bought this to use my desktop with some galaxy live buds (samsung earbuds).  They do not show up at all or if they do they're probably one of the 10 devices that show as Other with no name (living in an apartment sucks).  They are easily detected by my phone.  I have tried unpairing them with the phone - something that I shouldn't have to do at all which made no difference.I'm wearing a Charge 4 fitbit which shows up and pairs easily with my phone it shows up about 10% of the time in the BT devices on this adapter.I also tested this with a very old ISB64R wireless speaker which works with an equally old BT adapter and shows up as a headset where you have to enable audio sink for it to work.  I know they both work I tried to connect to this new 5.0 interface that claims backwards compatibility with everything and while it will connect it does not allow the subsequently installed "headset" to have audio sink enabled.Same thing with a ~2 year old VIZIO soundbar.UPDATE:  Windows 7 is not listed as a supported platform and ASUS has no drivers on their site for it.  However it will install the adapter and the "microsoft enumerator" automatically as BT radios automatically just nothing else will work apparently.  Yea it's an old machine given the other people's complaints that the adapter is trash on anything but a 2.0 USB port it makes no sense that they have no support for an older platform.  This is also not mentioned at all anywhere on the product page here on Amazon.  So much for backwards compatibility especially since the Bluetooth 5.0 spec came out in 2017 long before mickeysoft tried to force spyware on everyone.
5,This is a huge improvement over my onboard bluetooth 4 (laptop). Granted I keep this laptop closed with a monitor sitting on top which didn't do the onboard unit any favors I'm sure. My range with audio devices went from 15-20 feet to at least double that with much better performance through obstructions (e.g. multiple interior walls). Comparable to the range of a decent smart phone equipped with bluetooth 5. I'll update if it fails in the future.
5,It's a plug and play Bluetooth adapter. I plugged it in and my PC recognized it automatically. I bought it to use a wireless PS4 controller on my PC and it works perfect! Open the adaptor menu and scan put the PS4 controller in share mode by holding down the SHARE button and PS power button together for 5 seconds controller will start blinking and boom all hooked up!
5,I was having a terrible experience with this and my Xbox one controller at first but I downloaded “Xbox accessories” updated the firmware on my controller and downloaded official asus drivers. Everything seems smooth so far. At first the inputs were so weird. This adapter itself seems fine.
5,The thing works as intended unless it was designed to not work in which case it does work and isn’t functioning as intended. Regardless I am satisfied with my new Bluetooth life. It’s a lonely life but it’s rewarding.
5,I initially bought the BT400 and had issues connecting to BT devices and even when I could connect the quality was inconsistent depending on what audio program I was using on my computer….returned it and got this one the BT500. It was an easy install and the most recent drivers are on the ASUS website. It was an instant fix over the BT400. If you use windows 10 I’d recommend this.
4,Early Review - This review and stars will be updated over time if anything changes.10/20/2021: Zero complaints so far. Installed the adapter - no update needed - connected my Charge 5 and all is right in my PC BT world. Very easy no grief process. Given the ease of use I would likely buy another one if this one dies.
5,Nice small device that works as advertised! Great little device.
5,I've used 2 or 3 other generic Bluetooth USB antennae and this is definitely superior. The extra cost was worth it. The range on this is significantly better than previous generic ones I have owned.
2,-This is a review for the ASUS USB-BT500 Bluetooth AdapterMy Experience:  Ultimately it doesn't do what I need it to do. I am using a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller for my main controller to use with my PC I mainly play retro games like Pokemon Super Mario RPG and some others with this controller. My old bluetooth adapter was the built in one on my Asus B450-I motherboard which works just fine for normal stuff like my keyboard and mouse. The controller connected fine however when I would unpair it or would disconnect it I couldn't connect it back and I had to forget the device and reconnect it which is very annoying  having to do that every time my controller disconnects or whenever I had to turn off my computer. I was hoping that this device would be able to help me with that issue however it did not it did the same thing where I would have to forget the controller and add it back just to be able to use it again. Ultimately I just purchased an 8bitdo usb adapter and now I can connect the Nintendo Switch Pro controller to my computer by simply holding the A button anytime after I restart my computer or don't use the controller for a while and it auto turns off. If you are using a bluetooth controller or anything like that I would not trust an Asus product especially since I did try the built in bluetooth from my Lenovo Laptop and that seems to be working just fine and was a simple plug and play solution. I did try a test to check to see if maybe it was my main computer I disabled my Laptop's bluetooth adapter and used the Asus adapter instead and same issue my controller would not reconnect back however once I took off the Asus adapter and reenabled the Bluetooth Adapter built into my laptop it reconnected to my controller just fine proving that it was the device and not something on my end.Positive:+ Very small and compact+ Doesn't take any additional ports unlike the 8BitDo which you can see from my picturesNeutral:| N/ANegative:- It didn't allow my pro controller to reconnect to my PC which is the whole point of me buying this productRecommended:  No
4,Plugged it in and no drivers needed. instantly connected and no issues at all. used for controllers and headsets.  works with multiple devices at once no issues at all either
5,I bought this to use on my non-bluetooth computer at work. I got this one along with 2 others because me and my IT guy wanted to try a few and this one is definitely the best. It feels like a solid build was very easy to set up and has not dropped any connections yet. It took about two minutes to set up and now it just stays plugged in and I can just forget about it. I have connected both my AirPods Pros and my Bose 700s to it and they both work great and never cut out or disconnect. I use my Bose 700s with it at work daily for meetings that can go up to 3 hours long and have not had any issues. It is a very solid dongle with good connection. My IT guy was impressed and wants to order one for everyone in our team because we have non-bluetooth computers. THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY.
5,It fixed my issue with another product that didn’t work! So happy with this purchase!
5,ASUS provides a driver on their website for Linux but this adapter USB worked for me without doing anything or installing any firmware. Maybe some features aren't supported but my Wyze Headphones and Xbox One S controller both worked without issues at the same time once I got them paired. Just to be sure I wasn't missing anything important I did try some experiments with the ASUS driver but in the end I decided just to remove everything (kernel modules and firmware) and stay with the stock kernel driver.Linux has its share of Bluetooth audio issues such as no support for Absolute Volume yet so the volume keys don't sync to the system like Windows and I had to create an XDG autostart file to automatically re-pair my headphones after a reboot. If you use the bluetooth module option disable_ertm=1 for your XBox controller then AVRCP doesn't work on newer BT 5.0 devices since it's a requirement.
4,Had another brand usb Bluetooth device. That had issues and didn't work.I got this because my motherboard is asus also (trying to reduce any conflicts). It says the drivers are not correctly installed but it works.
4,Fantastic  use it  daily
5,Nice packaging.  Small size convenience.  Automatic driver installation on a Win10 computer that is too old for Win11 and has no built-in Bluetooth.  Now I can finally transfer photos directly from my phone to the computer via Bluetooth.
5,Looking over the LMP info in my screenshot it appears this adapter is bluetooth 5.1.First impressions review:I'm quite pleased. Install was easy. It installed just fine plug and play in my Windows 10 desktop without a need to download drivers though Asus has recent drivers for it on their website. And I trust Asus drivers over random generic brands any day of the week should they be needed or desired.Using with Bose QC 35 II headphones the range is a definite upgrade over both my old Asus BT400 and Plugable bluetooth usb 4.0 adapter. There are a few spots where I'd encounter audio drop outs and where the range would come to an end with the old 4.0 adapters but this BT500 adapter kept the audio going in those spots. So the range is better right off the bat. Sound quality is at least just as good as the older adapters.In conclusion I'm quite satisfied and pleasantly surprised with the improved range of the BT500. I'll make edits if I see anything worth adding to my review but it's looking good so far.
5,Works great easy to install just plug and play
5,I bought this for my computer at work (PC/Windows) to enable a bluetooth connection. It worked perfectly for my needs which was to be able to use my Apple AirPods rather than a corded headset I had been using. Cords just get all tangled up and you have to rip them out every time you slide chair out so being able to use this dongle to make my AirPods work has been AMAZING!
5,This ASUS Bluetooth adapter is well made and considerably faster compared to the Bluetooth adapter I was using that was purchased in 2014. The build quality is also noticeable when removing this item from the packaging with a refined looked that uses the ASUS logo on the top of the adapter with a bright gold metal color finish. The adapter was instantly recognized by my Windows 10 PC that has been compatible with the rest of my Bluetooth devices. I use a few wireless devices including a drawing tablet and this adapter has reduced the lag between the tablet and the PC by about 90% compared to the previous adapter. Now my Wacom tablet can be used productively with practically no lag! A great product.
5,It plugs and plays just fine on windows 10 pro... no need to do anything other than plug it in...Works as advertised with galaxy buds pro...
1,I'm having nothing but trouble.  Device seamed to work about two updates ago.  Today not so much.  See my original install issues below.  Then check out what you need to do to install the driver after every kernel update.  Currently when I power down and back up the driver does not turn on until I log in then remove it then open settings then plug it back in.  Only then may I click on the bluetooth mouse and re-enable it.  Until then you need a plugged in mouse to navigate in Gnome Desktop.  I don't call this compatible with linux at all.After every kernel update which is quite often you need to rerun ASUS software to install the driver again.  Or use dkms to automatically install the driver.  on forums.fedora.com I have a thread where we are trying to figure out how to use dkms with ASUS software.  This is a lot of hassle to get a bluetooth headset and mouse running with linux.Original Review)  Had to research how to install a driver uninstall the bluetooth drivers that came with Fedora 32 where the files are stored in Fedora 32 how to determine which driver was being loaded and multiple make Install=USB attempts with the software downloaded from Asus's site.  Also asus's site has no help for USB-BT500 devices.  Their chat function doesn't work.  It just sends you back to their help pages search.Once you get their driver installed and blacklist all the bluetooth drivers that comes with Fedora and possibly move their drivers into the correct places and xz compress them then the dongle works beuatifully.  At least I haven't had any troubles for the past two days.  (Four days of research to get to this point).  Not exactly plug and play.  Nor easy.  Their makefiles might put things in the correct place but after four days of work I'm not certain that  they did that or I did it through all the attempts.Isuses with existing drivers installed including only being able to pair things once.  Or no longer being able to turn bluetooth on.  Numerous communication errors in the journal and dmseg listtings.But I know a lot more about linux now.  That I really really never wanted to have to learn about.  And will probably forget by the time I need to know them later.  Or they'll change again in the next update.Also Fedora 32 kernel is 5.10.8-100 and the Readme.txt file claims kernel versions 2.6.32 - 5.7.1.  Hopefully 5.10 is okay and we won't have any issues.
4,Does what was needed use it to connect my Bluetooth headset and to connect to some devices at work. Was easy to set up though the range doesn’t seem overly far my laptop gets better range with its built in. Overall price was good for what was needed.
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Adds bluetooth to an older non bluetooth computer.  Seems to have good connection.
2,I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. It connects just fine and it’s plug and play. However randomly Bluetooth devices like a controller will randomly drop before reconnecting after 10-15 seconds. Drivers are all updated etc upon looking it up on google it appears that this has been an ongoing issue for a long time.
5,I wanted to stream audio to a Bluetooth enable stereo system from an older laptop which has Windows 10 installed. Plugged in this dongle and rebooted the laptop and drivers installed seamlessly. Stereo paired with no issues or actions needed on my part. Have used several weeks and had not had any drops or connection issues.
5,I mainly use this for my ps5 controller and has really good latency and makes any Bluetooth connection very stable and fast. I highly recommend getting one.
5,It's a bluetooth dongle. It is plug and play and requires no setup. Exactly what I needed.
4,Sometimes I get driver error resulting in me not being able to use Bluetooth devices. I don't know if it's because of the adapter or if it's just my laptop. Either way it still does the job when it doesn't have driver error.
5,Works great right out of the box
5,Bought this to connect my bluetooth devices to my PC since the MB didn't come with BT capabilities. Earbuds and other bluetooth devices connect as they are supposed to with no issues.
5,This tiny dongle has WAY exceeded my expectations.  I was convinced nothing could work as well as integrated Bluetooth.  I use this all the time and have not had one signal drop.  No static no volume changes no problems.I threw away the packaging so I don't remember the actual numbers but the signal broadcasts much much further than ASUS's own literature claims.  My previous integrated Bluetooth signal would break up if I went too far around the corner into another room.  This ASUS dongle sends me a signal through every wall in my apartment - even outside on my balcony.  It may help that I placed the dongle on top of my PC case rather than in the back facing the wall.  Either way it is working very well.I highly recommend this ASUS Bluetooth adapter.
5,Bought this to add Bluetooth to a Windows 10 work desktop.  There area bunch of Bluetooth dongles  for much less money on Amazon and many even have tons of positive reviews.  I went with this one because it was from a major brand and because it specifically said that it was plug and installation and it imported and configured its own drivers.  Sure enough that is exactly what it did and my not too tech savvy user was able to install it and be up and running in minutes.  The extra $10 was worth the guaranteed ease of use.  Highly recommended.
5,I am a bit biased towards ASUS stuff so I usually buy their hardware.  I got this for my Pixel A buds to work from my PC which does not have Bluetooth native.  I popped this in the USB 3.0 port on the front of my system and windows 10 immediately worked.  Clear crisp audio minimal to zero Bluetooth related lag.  Also it handles Bluetooth connection conflicts well.  Seems to know when to connect to my PC vs my phone regardless of them both being paired....not sure how that works exactly but glad it isn't a hassle to toggle between both devices.
5,This adapter does the job. I managed to connect a Xbox One Series controller and a PS5 controller. I haven't noticed any lag.
2,Every time I want to use it I have to fire up the blutooth troubleshooter.  Usually I can get it to function by reinstalling the drivers but sometimes even that won't work.I got this as a replacement for my old adapter because it began pulsing - at this point that's beginning to look like the more attractive option.Avoid this if you can.
5,Brought this for pairing ps5 controllers to an arcade cabinet. My original motherboard had integrated intel Bluetooth 5.0 but talk about a terrible experience. Would not pair more than three controllers at a time and would repeatedly randomly lose connection. With this asus bluetooth connector I've so far had zero issues. All 4 controllers easily paired and maintained connection.
5,My first Bluetooth USB adapter was by TPLink ($9.99).  It stopped working within three hours of set up.  I decided to buy this one since my motherboards are by ASUS.  Upon receipt it was a very easy and simple install/set up with my Windows 10 desktop and straightforward pairing with my Android devices.  It costs more compared to other cheaper ones but I'm satisfied with its ease of set up and performance thus far.
5,Came fast and easy to install
5,I love this dongle! I plugged it into a USB slot and it installed the drivers and it was ready to go! I needed it so that I could use my new bluetooth headset for work to talk to clients. What a simple process. I recommend this to anyone needing to add bluetooth to their computers. Mine was Windows 10.I tried adding bluetooth using an off-brand USB dongle from bestie buy - however it didn't work. There were no drivers on the dongle and when I used my new bluetooth headset it would not connect at all. I tried so many different drivers - it was madness. The Asus dongle is the BEST!!!
5,Bought this to use my PS 5 Dualsense controller for PC games. It works great: plug and play no input lag. If the battery runs low I can plug in my controller with a USB-A to USB-C cable and charge while I play.
5,I got this ASUS BT500 adapter because my internal blue tooth thing stopped working properly and using my earbuds and mouse were unreliable.  Not being a geek it would have saved me some time (and frustration) if the quick start guide would have advised to uninstall existing blue tooth devices from the internal blue tooth and reconnect and pair the earbuds and mouse with this new ASUS BT500 adapter.  Hence the lower rating on ease of install. Otherwise install was easy and the earbuds and mouse work great now.  Overall very pleased.  Thanks.
5,This works as advertised. Make sure to follow the instructions included with it and that the USB port you are connecting it to is version I think 3.1 or 3.2 idk.All I know is that I went from kissing my desktop to being able to go to the bathroom with no stutter or cut outs.Haven't tested the max range but I know it's more then 20 feet.And lastly! the cherry ontop. I can adjust volume pause and play. But can't skip forward or backwards. Nonetheless I love it.
5,I read a good review of this product so I thought I would give it a try. I had tried to add bluetooth to my PC previously and both times they failed. This dongle was recognized immediately installed without me doing anything. All I had to do was right click on the bluetooth icon in my taskbar and select Add a Bluetooth Device and there were my mouse and keyboard. What more could you ask for. Don't bother with the lesser products this is the one you want. It connected my 3.0 and 4.0 version equipment with no issue.
5,Works great has good range.
3,bought this so i can connect my desktop pc to my firetv and it doesnt even discover each other in the options. does connect to other things though
5,worked great
5,Bought to connect my airpods to my laptop. Just plugged in and worked immediately. Sound quality is just as good as with my iphone & galaxy.
5,Works. Great 5.0 BT Adapter for the money.
5,Used to replace my internal BT on my Motherboard which was fried by improper driver and/or hardware utilization by either DOOM or something else.  Yes DOOM kills more than demons allegedly.  Public Service Announcement to DOOM future/past fans: to use BT headphones with DOOM 1. disable the Hands-Free Audio Playback in 'Sound' Menu of your mic'd headseat before running DOOM.  2. run Doom. 3. Rip & Tear Until it is Done. 4. Live a happier life.
5,I got this to replace an outdated Bluetooth dongle that I had. This works just as well and faster than the one I had. I recently paired it with a Bluetooth speaker and at first I was kinda skep because the sound didn't quite match the video. After about 2 videos (about 12 minutes each) sound synched perfectly so I guess there is a slight learning period but after that it's awesome.
5,Solved my Bluetooth problem! Easy install easy to use.
2,I bought this to hook up my (very nice and quite expensive) Bluetooth headphones to listen to music watch movies and play games. There is about a 0.5 second lag between audio and video which makes movie / tv streaming extremely irritating. I also get lots of points where the audio will just cut out for a second and then resume. It didn't matter if I used a USB 2.0 or 3.0 the issue persisted.In the defense of the device here it only took about 15 seconds to set up from the package and it is very low profile so it isn't an eyesore or in the way unless I need the port it's plugged into in which case I just unplug it and reinstallation is as easy as plugging it back in.As for data transfers (ie moving photos / videos from your phone to the computer) it was pretty quick and that's the only reason this device gets 2 stars instead of one.
3,I never successfully connected my Bose Noise cancelling headphones which is what I wanted it for.I include that as a warning for other Bose owners. I've researched on the web to no avail.  Don't know if this product was never intended for headphones or the issue is only with Bose or not. So I uninstalled the drivers and threw the it in the junk drawer. Windows 10 said it was working fine when I did have it installed.
2,The driver for windows 11 does not work correctly. After each reboot I have to reinstall the driver. Today it took half an hour to get it working again. I have been late for meetings because I didn't know my adapter decided not to work. Avoid for windows 11.
5,I have bought several different Bluetooth adapters for my pc. All have not been able to keep the connection. In addition most would not be recognized by my pc after a few days. this would require a restart and starting from scratch a pain! The Asus USB-BT500 has worked well. My pc has not failed in recognizing it. Connection to devices is stable range is good. Installation on Windows 10 was simple plug and play. I gave 3 stars on Tech Support because I have not yet have had to contact them and cannot give an opinion.
5,Ease of installation and connectivity. ASUS products are well made.
5,The product is reasonably priced and easy to use. It was a matter of plugging it into a USB slot after which the bluetooth icon immediately appeared on my computer task bar and the Windows 10 bluetooth function was automatically switched on.My speakers are about 12 feet away from the adaptor.  There was no lag -- the audio is in synch with the video I see on my computer monitor.
5,The installation should be straightforward but a driver update was needed which increased complexity. Surely…most anyone installing this device type will eventually have success…which I found to be worth the effort…Keyboard printer and speaker connectivity improved noticeably using this device.
5,Llevo usándolo varios meses solo lo conecté y se reconoció automáticamente desde entonces solo ha fallado una vez pero la pc estuvo suspendida tal vez fue error de microsoft. En un espacio sin paredes he alcanzado 10 metros con audífonos sin que perdiera la señal.
5,This was a great upgrade plug and play!
5,Slipped into usb port easily first connection easy to do auto connects after that sounds great. Good value solution for no bluetooth laptop
5,Does exactly what I needed it to.  There was no installation for me.
5,EASY TO SETUP FOR A WIRELESS SPEAKER.
5,No issues arrived on time and quality product.  Vendor did an excellent job in ensuring I received this in great condition.
5,I thought it worked fine. The range was the same as my old one that had little antennas sticking out. I assume because it is more device-dependent than dependent on the blue tooth dongle. If I had known I would get the same range from a tiny little nub of a dongle like this I would have upgraded before my old one broke.
5,It is working well so fare.
5,ASUS USB-BT500 it was plug in discover and it was working 1 minute to install and your done.Sound with the Jabra 75T ear pods is good. Does the job.  Very easy install.  Easy discovery. no driver to load its auto plug and play.  follow instructions to turn off BT before you plug in with win10. and no issues.
5,The ASUS USB-BT500 bluetooth 5.0 USB adapter is very reliable simple to use and the sound quality is amazing!!!!
5,Probably the only name brand type of USB BT connector that was plug and play. There are tons of knockoffs brands on the 'zon but I have used ASUS brand items in the past. Not sure if ASUS actually manufactures this item or simply brands it. This replaced a last gen EDIMAX adaptor that failed after a year of use.This BT is tiny and currently pairs with Samsung Buds+ and Sony 1000XM3. Range is pretty good as I have clarity line of sight at 50 ft.
5,wanted an external adapter so i could add bluetooth to my Linux boxes as needed this one being basically plug and play worked out nicely.
5,My Computer doesn’t have a Bluetooth port so this device really saved my life! Super easy to use just plug it directly into your computer and BOOM done. Love it and definitely recommend!
5,Works perfect no issues
5,I really like how well it works on my desktop computer. My computer doesn't have a bluetooth adapter built-in so I bought this to use with my bluetooth headphones. This adapter seems to have a good range for the connection. It didn't require any installation just plug and play on my Windows 10 computer with automatic driver installation. So far I have tried it with 2 different bluetooth headphones and they have both worked well and is able to switch back and forth between the two seamlessly as well.
5,Great stuff
5,Very nice easy-to-use
2,Worked well for a month. Then after troubleshooting other dongles and BT receivers i have in the house I realized this thing crapped out after ONE MONTH.  Plug and play installed drivers from ASUS directly so its easy to setup but good lord one month? Audio quality went from 128kbps sound to probably 56kbps.  I've eliminated EM noise near it shielded it from other wires this thing is broken.
5,Works as advertised. Just plugged in and worked.
5,i got this because my pc had some type of driver issues with the bluetooth built in and as soon as i put the dongle it started working have had no problems for over 5 months and still going
5,It's a Bluetooth adapter there's not much to get wrong with these. I do like the low-profile design as it makes it easy to plug it in and leave it there without worry of bumping or bending the connector
5,I use Linux Mint 19.1 and this USB to Bluetooth adapter was plug & play. I didn't have to install any drivers or change any settings. It just worked!
5,Works as intended. Easy to install. I haven’t had any issues with my headphones/audio and the sound quality is just as good as my wired connect with a bonus of being able to walk around my apartment.
5,Plugged it in to an open USB 2.0 spot on my son's gaming build. Picked up his new blue tooth speakers right away. No software. Plug and play.
5,This thing is tiny and effective. Try not to drop it! I hooked it up to my computer and needed to remove it a few weeks later... couldn't find which port I plugged it into! SUPER SMALL!
5,Installation was a snap my experience was plug and play in an ASUS CM6830 desktop running a Windows 11 dev build. I use it to pair a set of Bose wireless headphones—the price was right and so was the result.
4,My Asus ROG Phone 1 has better distance than this.
5,I can't believe when I built my new PC that the MB did not support BT.  Anyway I purchased this item (there are cheaper ones like it but this one got the best reviews and I simply did not want the headache of a cheaper one possibly not working).This works perfectly without a glitch of any kind.  I use it mostly to connect my headset to my PC to join Zoom meetings.  Couldn't be more pleased.
3,Forget using the dongle if you want to listen to music.  Even sitting at the desktop where the dongle is inserted and connected to my BOSE NC 700 headphones the music skips a fraction of time.  If I turn my head 90 degrees it disappears repeatedly for a second or two until I face forward again.  I purchased two of these with blind faith in ASUS one for each of the household desktop machines.
5,I love this dongle!  The other one I had wasn't compatible with my newer computer so I bought this one.  I've never looked back!!
5,The best Bluetooth USB out there on the market.
5,Works as described.
5,I bought this to replace a different usb bluetooth adapter. The previous one would start cutting out as soon as I left the room. With this Asus apadter I can get pretty close to the other end of my house and still get audio to my bluetooth headphones.  It's low profile and and the drivers are easy to find. If I ever needed another bluetooth adapter this is the one I would get.
4,easy to install on win 10
5,Plugged it into my computer and was instantly able to use bluetooth. No lag and connected to my Airpod Pros without a problem. 10/10 would recommend.
5,Use it for Bluetooth Samsung earbuds and more. Everything works fast and the transfer speeds are great.
2,It works okay but I don't notice any benefit over the previous generation (BT 4.0) ASUS Bluetooth adapter that I got for around $5 yet this newer (BT 5.0) adapter cost me around $20.  I was hoping that this adapter would have enhanced range or would be more reliable or less buggy than my older adapter.  Unfortunately the range is the same (or maybe slightly worse) and I still have the same issues with Bluetooth connected devices occasionally refusing to connect/disconnect (requiring me to unplug the adapter to fix it).  I'm going to stick with my old adapter and give this newer one to my brother.  I feel like the new BT 5.0 is just a gimmick to get people to replace their old devices (I guess it worked on me but I feel like a sucker because of it).
5,This is what I needed exactly and it fit as expected. Very well packaged too.
5,I love music. I have bt head phones and the music is a dream to my ears.
2,Manufacturer's claim that the product is "Windows 11 Ready" is misleading.  When you follow the instructions to download the device driver appropriate to your OS you will find there is no driver for Windows 11.  The result is a device which works sporadically and causes the media you're trying to play to pause every few seconds requiring manual restart.  Would not have purchased this had the manufacturer disclosed that it had not even developed a Windows 11-compatible driver yet.
5,Besides the fact I'm paying for Amazon prime and had to wait just about a week  for this to be delivered to me I am happy with the results. The dongle works perfectly fine upon updating the drivers. I would give this 1 star but because the dongle works so good I gave 5 stars just beware you may have to wait a week to receive it
5,No need to install drivers. Better range than the tech key dongle that I tried before. So far I haven't had any cut outs or problems at all. I've noticed that devices connect to this dongle faster than the tech key one as well. Overall this is worth the wait since it's a little bit harder to get shipped to you.
5,The item was as described I had to download the drivers not a big deal works like a dream very pleaded and can recommend to anyone needing to get Bluetooth on a device
5,Usado en mi PC de escritorio.Comunica bien con perifericos.
5,I used this to replace my computers internal Bluetooth which always had crappy range. Plugged it in. Disabled the interal Bluetooth device... And good to go :)
5,Plug and play device excellent.  Had me using my bluetooth headphones with my laptop in seconds.
5,I ordered this to replace a similar one from another manufacturer.  It cost a little more but is so worth it.  The range is great so now I can really walk around with my bluetooth headphones on and it only starts having trouble when there are a couple of walls between me and the bluetooth adapter.
5,This is the second brand of bluetooth 5.0 adapter which I purchased. I found it easier than the other brand. What I desire from this brand and the other is more detailed instruction in a font size that is readable without magnifying glass.
5,Was out of stock so it took a while to arrive but worked out of the box no configuration needed.Strong connection from one corner of my house to the far end in the garage. I can walk down the street to get my mail and still have a perfect connection. I ought to try and walk around my block (it's a small block) and see what happens.
5,7/29/2021 with fully updated windows 10. Works perfectly and is incredibly small. More low profile then I was expecting. Tested Apple airpods speaker and Xbox one controller. Range seams like 20’+ with line of sight.
3,The sound quality was great but the audio delay was just enough to make watching videos or playback recorded audio a terrible experience. I downloaded the latest driver switched it to all my USB ports sat close to my pc and had no wifi interference. Don’t know if I can somehow fix this myself but if I can’t fix it in a day or to I’ll have to send it back.
5,I've had this for a few months and it's amazing it works far better than more expensive pci Bluetooth cards I've bought in the past.
2,Plugged it in waited for an autoinstaller no autoinstaller manually installed the drivers restarted PC required I deactivated built-in bluetooth.... man the hoops you have to jump through to get this thing working. Also not very intuitive given that there isn't much information on Youtube about this product.
5,It is tiny and apparently smaller than the ASUS USB-BT400. Windows 10 installs the right driver for it automatically. Somehow the driver downloaded from ASUS cann't be installed as Windows 10 says the version is older.
1,I [tried] to use this with a PS5 controller on a PCnever worked consistently more than 6 feet away from the device without delay or stutteringat time of review I can't get further than a foot from the device without it doing the same
3,It works really well however once in a while Windows 10 automatically installs a different driver from windows update and break the thing. The fix is to download the original Asus driver and install it again - it’s quite annoying though.
5,I have tried many different manufacture for BT 5.0.All of them result problem when I use it for conference (TWS ear bud) which work no issue on my Android phone.This one uses Realtek chip like some of others but better quality overall.Few more $ makes a lot of difference.
5,Worked seamlessly on my windows 10 desktop. Just plugged it in and it worked.
5,I have seen some bad reviews and was a bit apprehensive at buying this dongle. After receiving I immediately tried it out and found it working as a charm! Everything is in order! I always buy ASUS if I can.
5,Flawless. I was able to plug this in and it worked instantly after my PCs Bluetooth dongle went kaput. Very low profile the signal range is great and gets the connected devices to their max range. Very glad I just went with main brand asus rather than the other guys
5,This device was a quick and effective fix for a decent laptop which has a bad bluetooth module. There are cheaper ones but I like fully trusting the drivers.
5,It all around great
3,Cuts out for no apparent reason.
5,Sometimes deal with delay when streaming YouTube but I think that would happen with any products like this. Easy to setup and connect. Works as I expected.
5,Works like a charm! No audio delay on my Sony 1000XM3's sound is just as great as any device with built in Bluetooth! It's thin and has one hell of a range on it. Overall quality is great just what you'd expect from ASUS
5,Amaaaaazing. Here is the picture of the box for those that are curious. I’m using Bose 700 with my macbook and I really wanted to use it with my gaming PC. Here is the solution! Very happy with my purchase. Connection is very solid. No drop.
5,Awesomeness
5,Only 2 days in but it has fitted every problem I had with the Asus BT-400 and my Sony WH-XB900N headset. Will update after I find out more.
5,Worked well for me
1,Pugged it in and had problems right away. No driver and no installation disk. Took over an hour to find where to download the driver as it isn't available to download from Asus.com. Finally got the driver installed but the problems just kept coming. The driver constantly needs to be reinstalled whenever you start the computer and sometimes just at random while using it. So I'd reinstall the driver and it would work again for a little while. I'm currently running a fresh install of Windows 10 Home. And now it doesn't even work at all. I install the driver Windows says to restart the computer to finish installation. So I do and I'm back to square one with the driver error. No mater how many times I do this it never takes. I'm fed up and buying a different one.
5,W10 installed the correct drivers immediately and the included mini disc was not necessary. Significantly better connectivity that previous generations of Bluetooth.
5,It worked perfectly for my work laptop. I have to use AWS (Amazon workspace) and needed to find a way to connect my aftershocks headset to use within AWS. And can be used for other devices in the future as well. Super thankful I found this.
5,Very easy to install and setup disconnects very minimally is very quick to recover lost connection.
5,Bought this as an upgrade for my ASUS S301LA laptop (Linux Mint OS) to expand its device compatibility. It was a simple plug and play! I can now connect most of my devices by Bluetooth and liberated one of two USB slots.
5,Simple plug and play; 5.0 frequency
5,This was too easy to install. I now have Bluetooth keyboard mouse and numeric pad.
5,Easy setup.  Not yet tested in conference calls but audio comes through clearly without connection issues.
5,Good quality and packaging shows ASUS stands behind their product. A+ Bluetooth 5.0 performance.
5,I liked  the fact that  no additional driver sin Windows 10 were needed. Ive sent back 2 other adapters that were 11 bucks that didn't work. Maybe this is a BT version 5 thing ? The others that didnt work were bt 4
5,all i had to do was plug and play that easy
3,This item is non capable to interact with my Skullcandy Crusher ANC Headphones without disabilitating all other capabilities that I had as Dolby ATMOS y DTS X that i bought at Microsoft Store.
2,Connection problems horrible sound connection sounds like tv static. Don’t use for gaming latency is horrible and laggy. Don’t get.
2,Headline says everything: works great on Linux; no weird drivers needed -- and it works out of the box.I've had it for less than a week and now it no longer works.
5,I purchased this to have my desktop at work with my Bluetooth hearing aids.  Works like a dream.
5,Got it for my desktop computer that does not have any Bluetooth and I plugged it in and now it has Bluetooth and it has fast speed and connectivity well worth the money I would recommend
5,This USB plug-in Blue-Tooth adapter worked as advertised and was a good value.  I use it on my home built desktop gaming PC for wireless earbuds etc.  No problems so far (1 month +) and it worked right out of the box as intended.
4,It's perfect
5,Good purchase for the $
4,Bought it for desktop. Works well in Windows 10. Plug and Play.
1,Want to use a bluetooth device more than 1 m away from the adapter? Hope you enjoy severe latency issues that persist even when in direct line of sight of the adapter. If I cant use a wireless gamepad more than 1m away from the adapter without issues why bother with wireless at all?
3,I got this to connect my airpods and ps4 controller to my computer. I keep my PC under my desk and when I put my controller on top of my desk (which is a very standard wooden desk) it begins losing connection. Also if I stand more than a foot away from my computer with my airpods connected they begin to lose connection as well.
5,easy setup.... I am an ASUS fan  using their networking routers so this product like the routers work as expected.  Good range.
1,This version of Asus's Bluetooth adapters doesn't work on windows ten. I haven't been able to get this to work since i got it. Its not an issue with the hardware as much as it is software problem. the drivers for this adapter will say that there is an error with the Bluetooth adapter if you're even lucky enough for it to show up. if you try to install adapter as a "plug and play" piece of hardware it will show up in your system tray until you try to connect a device wirelessly after which the same error messages will appear. this seems to be a widespread issue. I tried to find a way to fix the issue but i cant find one. even ASUS hasn't come out with a fix. don't waste your money. stick to the BT-400 instead. at least that one works.
5,My game controllers worked unexpectedly as they normally require a separate proprietary adapter.
5,I got a Windows 10 PC and did not have to install the driver...
5,I bought this so I can Game with my PS4/DS4 controller on my PC.I have an ASUS ROG Strix Motherboard so I figured this was the best option haven't had a single issue.
1,One more product sold by Amazon in addition to the brand which does not work for more than ONE hour and half I have been trying to connect my peripherals a recently purchased TECKNET BM307 mouse and my Samsung Notes 9 smartphone which always have worked well with the hardware I had before.IMPOSSIBLE!I am asked for a code to pair the mouse which is impossible since no window to enter this code possibly as for the Notes 9 smartphone it is detected but there no pairing code sent as with other dongles or bluetooth cards !In short brand dongle certainly expensive certainly but which does not work!Very disappointed once again!
2,Running on windows 10 with an Asus mobo with a 9th gen i7.I've seen a lot of negative comments around driver issues. I'm not sure if my issue with this is related to drivers.I'm getting miserable range. Less than 10 feet with direct line of sight to my computer.With my headphones paired to my phone I can get 30+ feet without direct line of sight. This USB Adapter is more expensive than other comparable adaptors which I thought would translate to quality.
3,Does not work with Mac Mini 2018 model. I have a bluetooth 4.0 adapter that works on my mac.
5,Used this on my PC at work iphone and pc laptop.  Easy connection and set up. ASUS is a reliable name - I chose to spend the extra dollars for ASUS over unknown brands.
5,Bluetooth 5.0 is worth it the range is much farther than 4.0.
4,This works as expected.  Would have been 5 starts but for the long shipping time.
5,1-Acepta múltiples dispositivos.2-Muy buen alcance.3-Funciona con dispositivos que utilicen versiones de bluetooth anteriores.
5,So I bought the Bose 700 head phones and paired it with my computer. It sounded horrible. Was about to return it when I found this device. Paired it and instantly sounded better. Mo more disconnects abd clarity improved. Great buy. Thank you!!!
2,Antenna strength is too poor for use. Your device has to be directly beside the adapter almost touching in order to acquire a signal strong enough to successfully complete file transfer. At 3ft away signal strength will drop to 43%.
5,no issues  a good product tbh
5,Pretty much a plug and play blue tooth adapter if you machine doesn't have one for Windows 10. Also works better than the older versions.
5,Excelente muy fácil de conectar y me funcionó perfectamente. Cumplió todas las expectativas
2,The drivers provided by Asus sadly don't support newer kermel versions meaning that getting this to run on Fedora 35 is non-trivial.
1,The Bluetooth dongle works fairly well for my earbuds but terrible when it comes to the keyboard. I have installed and reinstalled drivers spoken with ASUS and done all the troubleshooting steps that they have recommended however not much improvement. The keyboard keeps disconnecting as I type and so does the mouse and it is very frustrating when one is in the middle of typing longer items or doing CAD.The worst part about speaking with ASUS support was that they asked me to return the product for repair to them using RMA process on their website. Now their online website is not recognizing the product Serial number for RMA (which is funny because they were able to confirm that it is under warranty on their end). Plus it will take them up to a month to repair the item. During that time they expect the customer to fend for themselves. No replacement will be provided. I should have returned the item sooner to Amazon after my purchase. I will reach out to Amazon to see if they can do anything to help.
5,I was interested in extending the range distance with this adapter.  It does exactly what I was looking for.  My expectations were met.  I'm very satisfied with this Bluetooth adapter.
5,Hook up on PC and it works perfect.
5,Connected quickly when two other bluetooth dongles barely worked if they hooked up at all. I'm going to buy another to replace my current one.
5,This is a plug-and-play dongle. I didn't have to install any software. Windows 10 recognized it immediately. Devices paired with it well. No issues no complaints.
2,I understand not officially supporting older OSs but making the install software intentionally throw up an error and not even try to install drivers in Windows 7 when it's effectively the same under the hood as Windows 10 is rude and shows a lack of care and support for customers who like using their computers more than their computers using them.This USB Bluetooth 5 plug works better with Linux's drivers in Manjaro [no thanks to Asus presumably?] than it does in Windows 7 even. If not for that I would have returned it straightaway.Get your act together Asus and support your customers over Microsoft please.
5,excelente
1,This worked with the Windows generic driver for a few days then on boot up stopped working with an error 43 code in device manager.  The only way to fix this was to download the drivers from Asus' website.  But every single time I reboot it reverts to the same error and I have to reinstall the driver.  It wouldn't be so bad if the driver software didn't literally take 10 minutes to install.Updated review: This adapter is pure and utter junk.  Not only does it continue to have the aforementioned issues with the drivers and having to constantly reinstall them the range is just awful.  If I put my hand in front of my headset it completely cuts out.  I don't mean covering my headset just in front of my headset.  I'm honestly flabbergasted that a company as large as Asus could put out such a completely worthless hunk of junk.  If I could still return it I would but it's not worth the .02 cents of gas it would cost me to drive to Kohls.
5,Love it
5,Great!
3,I got this to replace my BT400 dongle.  While this one works at close proximity it has a significantly shorter range than BT400.  Unless you really need Bluetooth 5 you should get BT400 instead.
5,Works with Debian Linux as advertised. Connects to a Wyze Headphone. Linux itself has issues supporting audio/mic through Bluetooth but no issue with this product.
1,Try what I found I downloaded the install from ASUS website me I needed Windows 10 64bit. Installed it and had all kinds of problems. But right off the bat I noticed that it was installing to the Program Files (x86) Directory instead of the "Program Files" directory but Thought well they must know doing with many uninstalls and re-installs I gave up. So...what I tried I got the installation file that was unzipped and deleted all folders in "BT-Driver" folder except the "Win10X64". Then did the install with the altered install directory. The install still went into the Program Files x86 directory (which I would say shouldn't because it's a 64bit device) BUT It started to work correctly and find other Blue Tooth devices. and worked after trying a few different devices etc.. They (ASUS) need to redo their install paths in the install files we are downloading from them.
5,Perfect plug n play device. Does exactly what you are looking for.
5,Connection is excellent. Does what is supposed to do. Recommend this Asus Bluetooth.
5,Works awesome!  Super easy to install. Just plug in and windows 10 does the rest!
5,Works great to add Bluetooth capability to a new laptop that did not have Bluetooth built in.
5,Great stable connection very high quality sound when using with headphones. Very long distance too!! Very pleased
2,The bluetooth adapter on my old laptop reaches across my apartment. After reading about this Bluetooth 5.0 adapter I expected the distance to be  10+ meters as described on other sites. However this adapter quickly loses signal after 2-3 meters. What's the point of Bluetooth 5.0 if it can't even reach further than older technology? I recommend this item only to user that want to stay within a few meters of their PC otherwise this is not the adapter for you.
5,I ordered these because I wanted to purchase Bluetooth version 5 headphones.These installed automatically in Windows 10. My headphones connect with ease.
2,I recently upgraded to this device from an ASUS USB-BT400 adapter which worked virtually perfectly for me. As others have reported the connectivity on the BT500 is quite spotty; I regularly experience connection drops on both my mouse and keyboard both of which worked flawlessly with the BT400 adapter. The drops on my mouse are frequent enough to be disruptive and I've had to resort to using the unifying receiver that came with my mouse for the time being.  I am hopeful that a driver update for the BT500 will resolve these issues but until then it's not quite up to par with the BT400.
3,I can't put this in the back of my PC or else the signal gets occluded. Will be upgrading to a wifi/bluetooth pcie.
5,Using this with my Sony wireless headphones. I like it and it was easy to set up.
5,Works as it should providing Bluetooth connectivity to my PC.
1,Worked great for 5 months then promptly died. Not impressed.
5,Mostly works on windows server 2016.  That said alot of bluetooth devices dont have drivers unless they are very mundane.
5,Plugged it into my pc and Windows set it up automatically. Works very well.
5,I haven't had any drop off yet.  Very good at holding the connection.I'd say probably the best on the market.
1,I followed all instructions in the literature.  I called Tech Support and he had no idea what the problem could be.  Waste of money.
3,Can’t get to support Bluetooth in win 10
5,Excelente conectividad Bluetooth
2,I know it's small and I have purchased these adapters before but I was expecting much better. I use it for my bluetooth headset when playing games on my computer.  It is plugged into the back of my computer as I ruined the usb header for the front.  I have to position my head far too close to the desktop that is on the floor in order to get it to stop cutting out.  Music seems to work better.
5,llego a timepo y funciona excelente
1,Maybe I got a dud but this thing just doesn't work on both my devices. It's really disappointing because I like to plug into my computer without having to deal with any problems. I've owned a BT device before and never had I ever had this issue. But here we are. Error upon errors. Normally try to be fair with my ratings but so far my experience with this device has been awful. I'm dealing with an error code 10 ~access denied ~ because some process trying to access an object on the device doesn't have permission to access it. Or the occasional error 43. I've followed the manuals instructions and even tried downloading the driver software from the website. I got nothing... Is anyone else dealing with this. It's really frustrating.
2,I followed instructiions coudl never get it to work as blu tooth connector from Windows PC to headphones
5,Plug and play with Windows 10 and VoiceMeter standard edition.
1,In using my Bluetooth hearing aids:  The audio quality was good.  The audio was synchronized with the speech.  But the audio would cut usually at least once a minute.  I have windows 10 pro and worked with a ASUS representative to get it to work with no luck.  Also the Bluetooth range is about 10 feet much less than the 20 to 30 feet I get with other Bluetooth devices.  I suspect since the dongle is much smaller than usual the radio transmitter antenna in it is very small and so has a short range.  I spent quite a bit of time trying to get it to work but gave up and had to return it.  I did not get a replacement and will try getting a dongle from a different manufacturer.  I was impressed with the online service I got from ASUS though.
5,Works great I'm a sucker for asus products because they never disappoint
5,Very small and quality is great.
5,I like the size.Came right up ready to go.
5,Did it's job
5,Me sirvió muy bien
5,Works great good brand name not a firmware virus
5,does what it says it does and well
5,The connectivity with my Dualsense controllers are fast and stable
5,Easy to install
5,Good product!
1,Constant issues with mine. It worked great on windows 11 for about a month. The the drivers kept having issues and showing uninstalled in device manager every time. reinstalled/restarted about a dozen times and the device just wont work anymore. Time to try a different brand. What a disappointment from a good brand.
5,Works great! Easy pairing. No negatives.
5,kinda trash ngl
1,The drivers weren't in the Linux kernal so it didn't work out of the box and the drivers I installed didn't work either (either due to human error or the fact that they just don't work)
5,Works nicely
5,easy to use
1,La conexion con mando es lenta  mi gente si lo quieres para jugar con mando. No te lo recomiendo. Esto lleva demasiado delay input lag... lo compre para usarlo en fronite. Y hace todo demasiado lento. No puedo construir super rapido.. menos mover la camara .. porque lleva mucho retraso... se siente orrible
1,Pure trash. Constant issues with drivers making the thing unusable and dropped connections on Windows 10. Bought this to replace my old BT400 which was having the same issues. I thought it was broken but these things are just garbage.
5,Good product
1,It works but will often loose connection so if say you are using a game controller you can have it were you are getting disconnected mid game play or if you have your phone linked to your pc you will hear the disconnect reconnect sound play back and forth for a while the worst time I had was my pc kept alerting me of my phone disconnecting and reconnecting for 20 minutes. trying different usb ports did not improve this even moved it to my laptop to test it their and it significantly underperformed my built-in Bluetooth transmitter even having lag were the internal one had none
3,Good range.Microphones do not work.
5,Good item!
1,I bought this USB  bluetooth transceiver to stream audio from my home built Win10 PC. The dongle installed and was recognized by windows as ASUS USB BT-500. Unfortunately and inspite of heroic efforts I was never able to get an audio stream to my headphones. I had the same result with a set of wireless inner ear monitors. I have had 2 ASUS routers which have worked well for me -  so I thought I would stick with a name brand (there are many unknown brands on the market of questionable quality). no luck. I don't know if this is a windows problem or a USB BT-500 problem. In either case it is getting returned.
1,The dongle found a native Win 10 driver and functioned very well for 2-3 weeks then just stopped functioning. Didn't want to load a large Asus driver. Actually bought a second one hoping the first had just failed. Second unit showed up as a BT500 dongle in settings but wouldn't  connect to anything. Avoid these.
1,I was very pleased when I got the thing.  Plugged it in it installed everything worked great detected my headphones immediately and worked all night.Today the thing can't detect them or any other device.  Tried installing their drivers instead of plug and play made no difference. Bluetooth icon is there windows troubleshooter shows it's working fine it discovers my upstairs neighbors apple watch but can't detect any bluetooth headphones even the pair it detected immediately when I got the thing. I'm on a windows 10 64 bit pc with no issues Useless/beware.
1,Zero stars stay away.As with so many others who made the mistake of purchasing this I plugged it in to find that it does not work. This is even after downloading the shady drivers from a dropbox account (really?!?!) and thoroughly scanning the files for malware. Upon reboot after installing the drivers my computer threw a stop error. Once that was addressed I attempted to pair several BT devices none of which could be found. I checked all BT services to ensure they were up and running and tried again. After several attempts I threw is in the garbage - it's not worth the hassle of returning.
2,For my set up I had lag on it when watching YouTube video’s tried all kind of tricks and nothing worked. I now use  it on a raspberry pi for my Xbox controller and works perfectly. Have not tried sound on the pi!
2,After owning for a few months it is now losing connection pretty frequently. Furthermore the plastic casing randomly broke off from very little disturbance (simply removing it from the usb). Not satisfied.
1,The audio quality was absolutely terrible for warzone. It was still great for music and what not but for warzone it was so bad on my Sony XM3s that I actually would have rather played without it.
2,Didn't work with Mac OS Big Sur
1,I spent two days trying to get this product to work on Windows 7.  It never even registered as being hooked up let alone anything else.
1,The device continuously throws error codes.  One minute (see pic) system reports it is fine.  The next the system shuts it down (see second pic).  I tried logging on to the Asus customer support site and there is none.  I have to download another app just to get customer  support???  Seriously?  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers.  The problem repeated itself.  This is on my desktop WHICH USES AN ASUS MB!
2,even with a rep on the phone I could not get the software to open . i cant get this to work . spend more to g et a tool that works
1,Amazon should REALLY state up front and in BIG BOLD letters that this device is ONLY compatible with USB 2.0. I have a brand new motherboard and it has ZERO USB 2.0 connectors anywhere on it. Why release a device that has the most current Bluetooth specifications and not have it be USB 3.X compatible. Waste of $20.00. DO NOT BUY if you have a newer motherboard with no USB 2.0 connectors.
1,Needs update before you start which defeated my purpose..
1,I really wanted this product to work and tried very hard to make it do so. I have an anne pro 2 keyboard and was having some connectivty issues with my previous adapter. I ordered this because it was low profile and ive always had good experiences with ASUS products. This was much worse than my previous one my previous one had some minor bluetooth drops but this failed to even connect in the first place even after 1 hour minutes of troubleshooting. save yourself the energy and the money.
1,Range is horrible. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,The new driver dose not want to update. It list as a application windows boots it.
1,Bought to "upgrade" my 4.0 Bluetooth dongle. This dongle intermittently stops working with my Bluetooth mouse. I spent hours trying different fixes updating windows drivers etc. could not find a fix. Gone back to using my generic USB 4.0 dongle.
1,I first tried using the dongle to pair my bluetooth mouse and I had problems with the mouse jittering and disconnecting randomly. I then tried to make a call with my earphones about 1 m away from the ASUS adapter with line-of-sight and the sound quality was absolutely garbage. Both of the mouse and earphones work just fine on my Macbook.
2,doesn't work wit linux mint or any other linux based system....but it said it does...
1,Shame on me..............I tried ASUS bluetooth before a couple of years ago.My other Bluetooth usb adapters (tp Link) work perfectly. They are recognized instantly they have the drivers already in windows. Also they connect to my AfterShoks headphones effortlessly.NOT SO with the ASUS.Sending it back.BTW...my motherboard is ASUS also. It's great.
1,Win 10 was not mentioned on the web page but printed big on the package. that's the mistake of web editor/ developer
1,I am finding that if you end up with any issues with an ASUS product you are pretty much out of luck. Their support is the worst I have ever experienced in my life. Would not ever recommend purchasing a product from that company.
1,The Drivers Only supports win 8/10.This information currently does not exist in the product description on this page.I have windows 7 and am not "upgrading" to operating systems that don't support my hardware.
1,Bluetooth 5 has made some protocol changes to ensure both a longer range and a better audio quality. Unfortunately this adapter was pretty poor in terms of both. I ended up replacing this junk with a PCIe Bluetooth card that worked well.
1,So....it just doesn't actually work for long.  It just randomly fails to receive anything.  Also 5 times is four times to many to have to reinstall drivers.
1,Didn't work on my pc
1,I was unable to connect to my computer. I didn’t see an option to communicate with a tech.
1,This USB/BlueTooth adapter does not work with Windows 7
1,It doesn't work properly my old bluetooth 4.0 connection works better in range.Very disappointed with this product.
5,Installed this in a Win 10 Home 64bit mini-PC with 8Gb RAM and Celeron N3450. Disabled Intel on-board Bluetooth first. Downloaded the latest drivers from Asus installed them and plugged in the dongle when it asked. It installed the dongle then asked for a reboot. Easy-peasy. This is being used exclusively in audio mode with connections to a set of Tribit XFree Tune Bluetooth headphones (BT 4.1) and a set of Audio Technica ATH-M40X headphones utilizing a first gen FiiO BTR5 (BT 5.0) as its Bluetooth connection. The dongle connects at the default SBC Codec to both cans and I assume this is unchangeable.My install is a bit odd. I have this mini-PC's USB outlets (all USB 3.0) totally loaded up. Two of the three USB connections are hooked up to USB hubs one of them powered. I have the BT-500 installed on the powered hub and it operates great as if it's connected directly to the machine. I was little worried that it would be problematic there but it's not so far.With the BT-500 I've noticed that I can walk almost all the way around the house and even three floors down in the basement (except at the very far end of it) and receive a flawless connection. I have an older Asus BT-400 I use with another (Win 8.1) PC and while great within about 10-20 feet starts dropping out after that point.  This one maintains a perfect audio connection at crazy distances way farther than I had hoped. Time will tell and knock on wood but for now I couldn't be happier and I'd say it's well worth the slightly higher cost.
1,Did you test this Asus bluetooth dongle on the Asus Prime X570-Pro?
1,Can't hold a connection reliably a a distance of two feet.
1,Does not work good.
4,It works right out of the box.  You don't have to install the BT500 driver if you use windows 10.  I actually installed the driver from the Asus website and saw no difference in performance.I mainly use this BT500 dongle for bluetooth audio devices.  I have connected this to Apple airpod pro and the singal range is about 10 feet.  I was expect longer range than this my iphone + airpod pro bluetooth would support up to almost 20 feet without any breaking up sound.  10 feet range is about the same as the bluetooth 4.0 dongle I have before this.  So I will keep since I can't find an issue with it just not as good as I expected.
5,I’ve purchased around 30 of these for my office computers. Plug and play no drivers no setup. It just works in window. You just have to pair your device with windows after you plug it in and you are good to go!
5,Works out of the box with Linux specifically Fedora 35 (5.16.12-200.fc35.x86_64).
1,This thing will NOT connect to Windows 10. Wait correction: It connects. And disconnects. And reconnects. And disconnects. And reconnects. And disconnects...Once you turn off Bluetooth uninstall whatever Windows automatically installs manually install drivers remove all of your Bluetooth devices maybe install the drivers again restart the computer and turn Bluetooth back on it will work. And if you switch Bluetooth devices turn off your computer or restart the application you were using with a Bluetooth device (???) it will disconnect and you will have to repeat this ridiculous process all over again. Every. Single. Time.The BT400 works perfectly. Lesson: If it ain't broke don't upgrade it.
5,Great usb for Bluetooth 5.0 but the price gauging here is insane. It's a $19.99 usb dongle everywhere but here.Don't get taken.
5,This device works well and installed without any problems in Windows 10. The drivers initially installed by Windows 10 indicate it is a Bluetooth 5.1 device. However if you get the latest driver from the Microsoft Update Catalog it will show the device is as as advertised a 5.0 device.
5,My MOBO Bluetooth died and this small low profile dongle works great so I didn’t have to replace the MOBO.
5,this is by far one of the best Bluetooth dongles I purchased. After plugging it into the USB port it is hard to notice it any more. One reason is because it is so small  another big reason is that it works so well and my Bluetooth devices connect to the computer so seamlessly every time. Highly recommended!
4,It doesn't list Mac OS support but neither did BT-400 adapter which was reported to work with Mac OS.
1,Can't be used on Apple OSX (I'm on 11.6.2)Device is detected on USB but does nothing with bluetooth.
1,This adapter doesn't support A2DP meaning the best bluetooth headphones will not be able to connect to the adapter. My Sennheiser PXC-550 can't connect... will it does connect but Windows is incapable of recognizing the device as an audio device so the headphones don't actually pair (continue to say "Pairing") and you can't play audio or use the microphone.I got the adapter for the sole purpose of being able to connect the headphones. The fact that a current adapter doesn't support a high-quality audio connection is inexcusable.Here's a response from Sennheiser: Sennheiser devices typically utilize A2DP in order to provide optimal audio over Bluetooth. Most computers' Bluetooth chipsets do not support A2DP (though most smartphones and tablets do). Check your PC's Bluetooth chipset manufacturer's website to see if they offer a firmware upgrade to update the firmware on the Bluetooth chipset to support A2DP and then the computer will be compatible with the headset.The most recent driver still doesn't fix the issue. If you want to connect quality headphones get another adapter.
1,Update: less than a month usage it already is starting to intermittently lose connection for one or two seconds at a time. No configuration change no interference even tried in my basement and has same problem.If this is your only wireless device and everything can use BT through it then it's probably ok. Unfortunately I have older devices with custom wireless dongles. After installing and using the drivers for this it breaks those other devices even when this is not plugged in.
1,Every single time you restart your computer or do a full shutdown you have to go to Bluetooth troubleshooting and have it reinstall and turn this thing back on. Ridiculous.When it is working it's great. Good sound and everything. But seriously guys... it can't work after 1 install... even 2? literally every time you have to go through the troubleshooter
2,In Win 10 this 5.0 dongle cause BSOD after exactly 5 min of being asleep.DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILUREDriver is up to date.Tried Asus installer form thier site same driver WIN 10 finds on its own.Went back to the BT400 model no issues.
1,I'm not sure if the issue lies with Asus'/Realtek's driver implementation or the hardware itself but this dongle is completely unusable on Windows 10 (latest release + drivers).The dongle is only a foot away from my peripherals with a direct line of sight.  ASUS telephone support was completely unhelpful. Downloaded all new drivers. Removed and installed drivers. Rebooted etc. Nothing.
2,Will have to call their tech support.
1,Like so many others I have problems with the drivers.Uninstalled Microsoft drivers and installed Asus drivers and still only got partial functionality.I'm A+ certified and this product is too much trouble for me.Sad!
5,Minor update: As I've used this adapter more and more I've started to learn it's little quirks. It doesn't like being plugged into a hub especially a 3.0 hub. I tried a 2.0 hub but still got mixed results. When I plug it into a 2.0 port that's on the computer case it's rock solid. Works perfectly every time. So I just leave it plugged in there since I don't use those ports for anything else these days anyway.Don't waste your time like I did and mess around with the cheaper options. I tried that and got nothing but grief. The el cheapo adapter made my computer unstable and didn't work most of the time. I returned it and got the Asus BT-500 since I had such a good experience with the BT-400 model. That was a great decision. This thing just works. Windows activated it as soon as I plugged it in. It was working but I went ahead and installed the Asus driver anyway. That was smooth and easy. It has been rock solid since. It connects to all my headphones as soon as I turn them on. Sound quality is excellent. So don't bother messing around with the junk. Just go ahead and spend the extra $5 for this one and your life will be better for it.
5,I had previously owned and used a generic USB bluetooh adapter since my motherboard didn't come with onboard bluetooth support. The adapter worked well but unfortunately wouldn't let me connect more than one device at a time. I primarily used it for my headphones and the audio would occasionally cut out. For this adapter I find that this issue is gone and I can travel farther with my headphones before the audio cuts out. For comparison my old adapter cut out when I left my room while this one allows me to travel to my kitchen with audio intact.Since the front ports of my PC don't work I have a USB extender cable plugged into the back of my PC and have it taped to the front of my desk with the bluetooth adapter plugged in. I highly recommend that you plug the adapter into the front of your PC or at least do what I have to prevent interference.
5,Plug and play with Windows10. Didn’t require download of drivers from ASUS. Open package insert into USB port and connect Bluetooth devices.
5,These work perfectly finally can enjoy wireless Bluetooth earbuds flawlessly. Make sure to disable any existing/integrated Bluetooth before installing. Also you need to use this with a USB 2.0 slot.
5,The bluetooth on my laptop stopped working which is apparently a common problem on the laptop I had. I bought this plugged it in and all my bluetooth devices immediately started working again.
5,Completely plug n play on Windows 10 (2004). Solid connection with my speakers.Excellent quality and good price.I never had problem with any ASUS products.
5,Asta el momento  no tiene fallas funciona  bien solo es cuestión de configurar con tu PC.
5,Easy to setup and connect fast with great sound coming from my airpods pro!
5,Works great right off the bat with Windows 10.
5,Worked great on my laptop. Love that it is not bulky and you don't even know it is there.
5,Bluetooth 5.0 supports more devices greater range and less latency than 4.0. If you've had issues with older bluetooth dongles lagging-out when too many devices are connected then this would be a great solution to that issue. Windows 10 PCs require no additional drivers or installation procedures- just plug it in turn it on via the control panel and you'll see the difference in no time.
5,Update: (1) on debian 11 one reboot I lost the drivers and needed to re-install.  It was easy enough but I need to figure out why linux did not reboot the drivers.  (2) I hope KDE will include headphone battery indicator so I can see how much power is left on linux without having to switch to iphone.  I know this isn't directly related to this adapter but I thought it was worth sharing.I followed the linux directions (in the readme file) of the latest linux drivers available for download on the Asus website.  The usb was recognized without any problem.  I then made sure to switch codecs from pulseAudio to pipewire using easy online directions (apt remove old codecs apt install new ones) and all my bluetooth headsets are connected via BT 5.1.  My headsets are BT 5.2 so I hope Asus is able to firmware update this adapter to 5.2 so we can make use of the new LE platform soon.  Overall I am super pleased.  Super stable no drops can walk all around apartment (1000 square feet) through walls doors closed no lost connections at worst LDAC bandwidth drops but SBC-XQ seems super stable.  Can listen to music while brushing teeth with bathroom door closed.  Impressive.  I use an USB3.0 6 foot extension cable and place the adapter next to my monitor.  More than satisfied full marks.
5,I was not sure what to expect because of the some of the negative reviews but I just received it and tested it out and there was really no other setup I needed to do. I am using a Windows 10 Dell Optiplex desktop. I just plugged the adapter in it installed the drivers for me and I was using bluetooth almost immediately! Really happy with this purchase but will update if it causes me any issue in the future.
5,Easy to install and easy to use!
5,Started working right away. I connected both my new wireless headphones and game controller to this without incident. Like a glove. No software to download no settings to change. Just works.
5,This was a nice upgrade for my pc. Didn't want to buy new speakers and I've got bluetooth everything laying around. Now I have a sound bar and some earbuds connected via bluetooth.
4,When connecting it first connects my earphones as "voice only"  I must begin playing music on my computer then disconnect and reconnect a couple of times before the earphones are playing music.  This is my only criticism; otherwise the sound quality is excellent at least to my somewhat damaged 79 year-old ears.
5,ASUS USB-BT500  Adapter....plug &play....Better range....Better sound....fast shipping......GH
5,Make sure you disable your computer/motherboard's built in Bluetooth before installing. Then download Asus's drivers and run the application for your operating system. It does not seem to be plug and play! Once the drivers were installed it worked perfectly with my Sony headphones and wireless keyboard simultaneously. (I also plugged mine into the USB 2.0 on the back of my motherboard as I've seen many reviews stating it will not work with USB 3.0)My ITX mobo couldn't even detect my keyboard and would constantly loose connection with my headphones. But this little bad boy was the solution!
5,Worked perfectly out of the package. This could not be found locally but was on Amazon for a good price.
5,Bought some speakers for my computer and the only way I could hook them up was by Bluetooth.My computer didn’t have Bluetooth so I bought this and now the speakers are hooked up!
4,Just plug it in it's added bluetooth.
5,Used on a dual system Linux (Mint) and Windows 10. No problems with either. No drivers needed and immediately solid connection with Bose 35 headphones that had not worked with on-board Bluetooth.
5,No problems works well great product
3,I got this adapter to use with my virtual machine but it wasn't plug-and-play as described. It worked on one machine but in this case one size does not fit all. Please make sure to do research on your specific configuration before purchasing this device.
5,has great distance! and clear connection
5,This receiver fixed my Bluetooth problem. My original Bluetooth stopped working after an OS upgrade and could not be enabled via the Operating System. I tried all of the recommended troubleshooting via tech support and Internet searches with negative results. I then installed the ASUS USB-BT500 and it immediately restored Bluetooth in the OS. Works and sounds great. I am running an older 2013 HP system.
5,I used this on my docking station to attach peripherals to my computer.  Works awesome.  Does exactly what it claims it will do without fail.  No issues pairing.  Plug and play.  I am happy with my purchase.  Had it for over a year now and haven't had any issues.  Highly portable easy to use plug and play.
5,Bought this because a recent Windows 10 update trashed my laptop Bluetooth adapter drivers and can't be fixed.  Plugged this unit in downloaded the drivers and it works perfectly.  Range seems better than the built in Bluetooth adapter in the laptop.
5,Just follow the instructions on the  ASUS driver website. BT500 was recognized and shown on the Ubuntu Bluetooth settings panel after I compiled and moved the driver into place. Connected to my headphones and worked like a charm straight away.
5,I bought this so I could use my Apple AirPod Max headphones with my PC.  The onboard PC bluetooth receiver was barely strong enough to make a connection so I decided to try this Asus model.  Very simple install had to disable the onboard receiver and then the PC Asus immediately recognized the AirPods.  Sound quality as good a bluetooth can be.  Line of sight distance is very good and 15-16 feet through one wall and around corners works pretty well too.  Only thing you do not get (which is to be expected) is any AirPod specific functionality - as far as the computer is concerned these are just bluetooth headphones.
5,Compact and functional works great!
5,Plugged it in and my bluetooth devices connect just fine.
5,I like using xbox controller on some games non shooters on pc. I have a Dell and the Bluetooth card went out "common" problem with them. But it's seated under gpu. So I bought this dongle to save time and connect faster and better.
5,On Windows 10 or 11 this little device is a plug & play after insertion into a USB slot. Not only does it work well but Asus support is there to reply to any question that you may have. It works and now I have Bluetooth on my PC.
5,Longer range and lower latency compared to the BT400 which works well when I use my ps5 dualsense controller over Bluetooth on my pc
5,Every time Windows update the Bluetooth on Windows just alwaysbreak my audio stutters at a slight move and it goes on and off.But thanks to ASUS that doesn't happen anymore I can even gointo my closet without any stutter in my audio you'll get a littlepeak static at rare times but it's fast for mouse and keyboards andfor audio devices. Well worth it.
5,Installation was as simple as just plug it in the USB port and you're good to go! The range is phenomenal especially compared to my previous Bluetooth device. I have a 1240 sq. ft. apartment and there is no connection break or distortion to the audio at any spot in it! And the audio quality is perfect pick this up if you need a Bluetooth upgrade like I did
5,I bought a cheap $10 adapter made in China and it had unusable sound quality. Got this one immediately after for $20 and the sound quality is sooooo much better. Highly recommend
5,Bought it for one of my friends and he says it works fine
5,Very easy to use and it paired with my smasung ear buds well
5,Used for a newly built PC and all peripherals connect without issue! 10/10
5,I am using this on an older computer that did not have blue tooth functionality. It works fine except for using Quicken. I have no explanation for this.
5,Great Range if paired with an equally capable device.
5,Rock solid connectivity excellent range - unless someone runs a microwave between you and the adapter but even still doesn't disconnect.  Does make me wonder how much radiation microwaves really put out though...Edit: using official drivers on Windows 10 in usb 3.0 slot with Anker q35 and have had panasonic and JBL headphones all connected at the same time. Effortless stable connection each with perfectly synced audio to video.  Usually it's the 5 star reviews you can't trust but in this case I suspect it's the 1star reviews that can't be trusted.
5,Reçu rapidement en bonne condition et selon la description
5,Easy setup very effective.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I'm not sure if the issue lies with Asus'/Realtek's driver implementation or the hardware itself but this dongle is completely unusable on Windows 10 (latest release + drivers). My BT keyboard and mouse stop working every 10-15 seconds due to severe signal stutter.The dongle is only a foot away from my peripherals with a direct line of sight. For reference a ~$5 no-name BT 4 dongle with the same PCB antenna design has absolutely no issues with the same hardware in the same (low EMI) environment.Additionally reconnecting to BLE devices with this dongle seems to take 2-3x as long as it does on its no-name counterpart. ~3-4 seconds on the generic dongle vs ~10 seconds on this dongle.
4,J'ai contacter le soutien technique pour pouvoir installer cette clé Usb. Après deux reprises aux soutien technique les problèmes que j'avais ont été résolu. Merci au soutien technique. Je crois que cette situation dépend de ce qui est déjà installer sur l'ordinateur au niveau Bleutooth. Le mieux est de tout déinstaller ce qui est Bluetooth sur l'ordinateur avant de faire l'installation de cette clé.
5,Works with Steam and all that perfectly fine (keep in mind a lot of games outside of Steam won't recognize a PS4 controller so you'd need the DS4Windows application but that's another topic). My PC instantly recognized the dongle and after following the simple instructions of downloading and extracting the driver file (with a straightforward setup wizard exe inside) was able to connect my controller first try hassle free. Also nice is that when I turn off and then turn on bluetooth it remembers the controller fine as it should so no issues there either. Oh and in terms of range and responsiveness idk if it's a placebo but it seems faster (more quickly responsive) than using my wire and I was even able to get the same functionality upwards of 6m without walls. Ah and of course it supports more than one device at once (not just pairing). Going to update if there are any issues over the next few months. Edit: Had a load of issues with DS4Windows and Steam constant disconnects after at one point updating drivers through Windows manually what I learned don't go to Windows and have it automatically update and choose drivers go to the site ASUS provides and do it (which is what I had done in the first place but of course I had to play around with things and muck it up) fixed all the strange issues.
1,XBOX One controller has intermittent connectivity at any range. Sometimes it won't connect at all sometimes it will connect and work fine for a couple minutes. Connection drops quickly and frequently; it's unusable. Controller works fine with my laptop's Intel bluetooth or connected by USB cable.BOSE bluetooth speaker connects fine but connection is too unstable/slow for audio playback. Music stutters stalls and skips; it's unusable.I downloaded the official drivers from ASUS and I still get terrible performance on Windows 10 64-bit. ASUS website has no troubleshooting suggestions for bluetooth connectivity problems and drivers haven't been updated since May 2020. I tried plugging it into every USB port on my PC with no change in performance.Very disappointed with this product.UPDATE Feb 10 2021: ASUS adapter is still useless with no updates available from ASUS. I found an old Rocketfish bluetooth adapter that I bought maybe 5 years ago. The Rocketfish adapter works perfectly for all my needs where the brand-new ASUS fails completely.
4,You need to put it in a usb 2.0 and NOT a 3.0. Mine kept disconnecting and took almost a minute to connect again to start all over again since i changed it from a 3.0 to a 2.0 it work like a charm.
3,Compre pensando que funcionaria para mi Macbook Air 2017 se que el BT400 si es compatible pero este aparentemente no. Intente hacer miles de configuraciones nunca jalo.En mi desktop Dell si jalo pero no funciono como realmente queria. Tengo unos audífonos bluetooth que al entrar a llamadas en Skype Zoom RingCentral y demás el audio baja automáticamente de calidad y esto es nomas en llamadas en musica o videos donde no se utiliza el microfono funciona sin problema. Supuestamente con bluetooth 4.0 pasaba esto ya que la capacidad de banda ancha del BT 4.0 no se da abasto que es limitada y que en la 4.2 ya tiene mejoras que evitan esto sin embargo con este 5.0 siguió pasando no hubo manera de arreglarlo. Cheque los drivers y detalles y si es 5.0 pero no se porque no jala como en teoria deberia de jalar.Mis audífonos funcionan perfectamente bien con un iPhone 7 o Nokia 7.2 usando las mismas aplicaciones mencionadas y estos teléfonos tienen BT 4.2 la calidad nunca baja se escucha HD en cambio en la PC se escucha con calidad baja.Tambien lo utilice con un control de xbox one en la desktop Dell y todo jalo bien.
5,Item works as advertised. Bluetooth controller on my SASUS motherboard packed it in so I opted to use this. Just plugged it in and Windows had no problem recognizing and installing drivers.  All my headsets now connect without any problems.
1,Plugged the stick in. Downloaded driver straight from asus then proceeded to troubleshoot for half hour why it wouldn't work. Eventually it started working randomly but I couldn't connect both my xbox controller and wireless headphones at the same time like I could with my old bluetooth 4.0 dongle.
5,The bluetooth adapter worked well with both my earbuds and over ear head phones.
5,I was looking for a Bluetooth to support few devices at same time and this one works perfectly.
5,J'aime bien être connecté et le BT-500 fais vraiment ce qu'il faut et compatible avec tout mes appareils bluetooth !
5,This is small and don’t take up much space around your device. Even better is that it is connected and recognised as Bluetooth transmitter/receiver and connects smoothly. The range is also quite far.
5,Simple et efficace.
5,Fonctionne à merveille
5,After installing the linux drivers from the instructions on the Asus website. This dongle works well.
5,rien de plus simple ma fille de 10 ans l'a installé!
5,Works very well. Finally my hubby can use his headphone hands free.
1,Keep getting driver error. Driver is current.
1,It did not allow my blue tooth Bose ear phone to work wireless and that is what I need a device to do.
5,Super
5,Have a good range for my phone to connect to my PC.
5,So far so good - Used for headphones
5,Product works as anticipated.
5,justo lo que esperaba
5,Correct
3,Lo compré para unos controles de xbox en windows. Se desconectan si uso dos al mismo tiempo
5,I have a 10 yr old laptop that's updated to Windows 10.  Plugged  in the adapter it set itself up turned itself on I paired wireless earbuds that was it. Simple. There's no lag so video remains synced and it still works if I leave the room.
5,Bluetooth 5.0 pour vrai
5,For some reason I lost my Bluetooth on my computer I tried everything to get it back with no luck this adapter worked well windows found it right away and I now can add my Bluetooth products again using windows Bluetooth settings
1,Ever since I've picked up this bluetooth connector I've had repeated issues with it.  I regularly need to reinstall the drivers in order to get my devices to connect and there is no real rhyme or reason to it.  Even when the driver appear to be working correctly they function intermittently at best.  I would not recommend this bluetooth connector.
5,Really fast response time. Works great for competitive gaming with a wireless controller! Feels faster than wired.
5,Prompt delivery and good quality
5,I needed this to connect to a headset because my work laptop has a garbage internal bluetooth transmitter. I have had zero issues since getting this. The range seems fine but my apartment is small (~400sq ft) so it's not saying much that I can go anywhere in it without disconnecting.
5,should have bought these a long time ago always fought with my old bluetooth transmitter playing games or listening to music.  plugged this one in and BOOM great sound no lag
4,I am a fan of ASUS products for the last 15 years.I never had a problem and ASUS USB-BT500Bluetooth 5.0 USB Adapter is one of them. The technicians always helpful to clear my doubts. I recommend this product.Thanks ASUS
5,A legit Bluetooth 5.1 tongle as per the version shown in the device manager.Purchased this for Sony WH 1000XM4 headphones to use with MS teams but the audio is still very choppy. The earphone counterpart WF 1000XM4 however works perfectly fine.
4,En general el producto hace lo que dice en su publicación.Hay dos detalles que me dejan pensativo.Usa los drivers de Bluetooth 4.0  antes de este tuve el BT400. Y no siento diferencia.Descubrí que los drivers que utiliza son los mismos que usa el BT400.Solo un programa me pide Bluetooth 5.0 y curiosamente funciona. Así que supongo que los drivers traen las dos versiones.Por otro lado me dio curiosidad si tiene soporte a AptX y no. No tienen. Un poco decepcionado por ese lado. Pero no puedes exigir algo que no está publicado verdad?Pero siendo Asus… quizás esperaba ese plus.
2,Cuts out half the time. Lags sometimes when using xbox one controller. Also experiencing very poor audio quality when using Bluetooth earbuds. Will be returning
5,works very well
1,I’m sad.I have it hooked to an usb3.0 port and my headphones glitch to all hell. Sad I bought this.
5,With this I was able to hook my airpods up to my PC. It doesn't have the best sound quality though (per my coworkers).
5,Easy to install and to use.
4,Facilismo de instalar y usar. Mi único detalle esque lo compre para usarlo con mi control elite series 2 de Microsoft y siempre que lo uso derrepente no responde y se vuelve loco no tengo fallas al usarlo con su cable pero siempre presenta este problema al conectarse por bluetooth.
5,My ps5 controllers work perfectly with it without any latency that i can see. They show up in windows as standard game controllers and steam big picture mode detects they're ps5 controllers and maps the buttons correctly.
3,I think that they greatly exaggerate what this thing can do. Maybe in a lab environment it would attain the specs but not in real life.The Bluetooth on my laptop for example allows me to walk around the house and have perfect sound all the time.But with this even when I’m at 2 feet from the adapter I often get bad sound.
1,No mention of incompatibility anywhere until you try to install the drivers. I wasted a lot of time.
1,the wireless earphone could not connect to this  blue tooth adapter
5,I nearly returned it as it was not connecting with with my Sony xm4 but after a Windows update it started working. It works with Xbox controller too. Happy with it as I bought before a cheaper dongle that failed within weeks
5,As expected.
5,Love this product. My windows 10 gaming PC has a slightly older motherboard without built-in bluetooth. I was previously using a bluetooth 2.1 adapter and even just my chair within the direct line of sight to the stereo would cause interference. I swapped in the new bluetooth 5.0 adapter and it worked like a chart right away didn't have to re-pair devices either sound quality is great.
5,Much better than the generic brand I tried. 2 different desktop computers recognized it immediately and let me connect my mouse without issue (unlike the generic brand) and I have yet to have a single cutout with multiple days of use wile the generic brand would have multiple cutouts a day that lasted for about 10-15s.
5,Fonctionne très bien
1,So I guess its an issue with the new windows or the driver who knows. After 20 minutes or so things just stop working. No they do not disconnect they are still connected just won't do anything - sound stops keyboard stops mouse stops. Looking in Win10 settings they will still say "Connected" but until a computer restart they wont work.Just unplugging the dongle doesn't always fix the issue the restart seems to.Returned
5,I have a Mac Mini 2018 model (Intel CPU) which has notoriously poor Bluetooth performance. I was coming from a MacBook Pro and I could walk around the house and never loose sound in my AirPods. With the Mini if I move 3 meters away connection drops. Plus Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad random disconnect. Really not fun. I plugged this Asus dongle on a USB hub about 60cm away from the Mini and it solved my issues. I can roam the house again and keyboard & trackpad stay connected. I run Big Sur (did not try on previous macOS versions).To use it you need the free Developer Tool “Bluetooth Explorer” (Google it). Once you connect the dongle start Bluetooth Explorer then menu Tools / HCI Controller Selector. The dongle should show up with the name Realtek. Click on Activate. For me all Bluetooth devices disconnected while macOS switched to the USB dongle then all my devices did reconnect (I had a wired keyboard and mouse at hand just in case did not have to use it - but better safe than sorry). It says it will revert to the internal Bluetooth after reboot I have to try (but I am ready to live with that limitation).
1,it worked great for a few days. then stopped after a week of purchase. im a fan of asus product but this one let me down.
2,Xbox series x controller drops out every few minutes with this adapter with Windows 10 and latest controller firmware. Mouse and keyboard work fine however.
1,Le plastique a cassé à la première utilisation et je n’arriverais plus à la sortir
4,Purchased to run an XBOX Series S/X Wireless controller. Installed automatically and works as expected.
5,Tiene una buena coneccion pero no puedes alejarlo mucho del dispositivo que tengas conectado ya sea tu telefono o un mando de Xbox
1,I am 1.5 feet away from the dongle and get intermittent connection drops on both a Xbox controller and wireless earbuds. When I turn my head just a little bit my earbuds would drop. I have tried different USB ports and it is currently in the one nearest to me.I can walk around the first floor of my house and still get reception from my phone via bluetooth but as soon as a stand up and take a few steps away this dongle would struggle keeping the connection. I doubt this is Bluetooth 5.0 its claimed to be 4x more range maybe that meant from 1mm to 4mm range.
5,Just works. Now my desktop can connect game controller headset etc. Range is also okay.
5,Fue lo que me sslvo de tener mas emisores bluetooth y ha sido. Una gram compra
5,Muy facil de usar solo se inserta y listo Windows 10 lo reconoce de inmediato.Funciona perfecto lo he usado con audífonos y con el teléfono sin problemas.
5,Works perfect 0 connection problems plug n play.
3,This dongle is a Realtek (RTL8671B) technology and not compatible with macOS.
5,ultra petit efficace
5,Very impressed with it. I use it to connect my headset and it keeps it's connection even when I go downstairs in a different room.
3,Sony wf-1000xm3 is unable to connect to the ASUS USB-BT500 Bluetooth 5.0 USB Adapter under windows 10. No problems with other bluetooth wireless earpieces.
3,I purchased this to improve the range of my Bluetooth 4 PC but it didn't achieve it.The range is almost the same. In comparison my galaxy s21 phone has much better connectivity and range.I use it to connect my PC to my wireless headphone.
4,Couldn't sync.
4,installation et connexion rapide
5,Plug and play easy to set up and just what i needed.
4,installation et connexion rapide
4,Couldn't sync.
5,O produto chegou bem antes do prazo. Até o momento está funcionando perfeitamente sem interferências e ruídos. Fácil de instalar e funcionou para todos os acessórios bluetooth que possuo.
2,Estuve esperando este BT500 casi 1 mes para recibirlo y vaya decepcion el peor producto de Asus que he tenido lo probe en 2 equipos diferentes con drivers de asus y los preinstalados de windows puertos usb 2.0 y 3.0 con el mismo resultado: deja de ser reconocido por windows en menos de 5 minutos supongo que solo es un problema con el dispositivo que recibi porque a otros les funciona bien pero termine solicitando la devolucion y reembolso.Solicite un dongle TPLINK 5.0 y sin problemas con el.
5,Prompt delivery. Good product.
5,It was plug and play and worked great.  No problems so far
5,Works well with windows 10. Does not work with windows 7.
5,Fonctionne bien avec un Toshiba L70-A-04E
5,Funciono a la perfección
5,Muy buena antena BT!!
3,Had a hard time setting this device up even after installing all the related Asus drivers i could find on their website. The range is really good can typewrite with BT keyboard and listen to music while I'm two rooms away (about 6m). Stopped working when i switched for Windows 11 but i guess they release a new deiver version short after and it sterted working again! Really good alternative for PC without integrated BT card!
5,Pour émettre le signal audio (JRiver Media Center 27) de mon laptop la musique se trouve sur une puce de 512 Gb type 10 et est transmis dans mon DAC SMSL Le signal numérique est reçu dans monAVR DENON  AVR-X6500HImportant: il faut neutraliser le BT existant avant tout. Quand la puce ASUS USB-BT500 Adaptateur USB Bluetooth 5.0 est insérée dans un port USB A type 3 Windows 10 installe le driver requis.
5,Plug in play windows reconheceu na hora.
1,doesnt work with my bluetooth headphones absolute garbage for my ps5 no idea how it is for other devices on a pc but i needed it for my audio on ps5 and its useless find something else
5,Haven't had any issues so far. Would recommend.
5,Just plug and play comes with auto update with latest driver able to connect my air pods pro and ps5 controller easily. Highly recommended.
2,Every 10 min or so I lost connectivity with my Xbox controller. Picked up a TP Link adapter haven’t dropped a connection yet.
5,Used on a Windows 10 PC with no fuss. No drivers needed and everything worked flawlessly.
1,Not sure why this doesn’t work properly tried troubleshooting with no luckIt creates two sound profiles but one has terrible quality and the other one does not allow voice from my headphones
5,really small works well a great bluetooth adapter.
5,Ça fait la job
5,upgraded the bluetooth connectivity in my desktop wild range even being plugged in the back of a big steel box lol! Definitely an improvement of function and connectivity.
5,I’m using it for short time yet. So far so good. I hope it will last for long time
5,appareils sur ordi
3,Do not use this on a USB3 jack. The device will cause constant disconnects and reconnects rendering it unusable. Only if you install it in a USB2 jack will it work properly. You can install the drive from Asus but that is not going to solve the USB3 issues. Distance is improved due to BT 5.0
5,Works great.
2,Did not work for my controller nore keyboard.Ordered another one and worked np.
3,I have another dongle that is 1/3 the price and I wanted to get an item that had a better range/connectivity specifically for couch gaming. This product wouldn't even detect my Xbox controller.
5,I upgraded to this from the Aventree Leaf because of connectivity issues. Works like a charm. I personally had no issues with drop-off or clarity.
5,Used to add bluetooth to a Lenovo tower server running Windows 10. Was instantly recognized by Windows. Does what it's supposed to do.
5,Worked seamlessly as advertised. Would purchase again if needed in the future. No tech support required. Windows 10 64bit laptop.
5,Had Asus 4.0 adapter before and it was stuttering and cutting in/out sometimes.  Updated to this 5.0 adapter all the previous problems are gone.  Only use this to connect BT headphones and didn't notice any lag.Windows 10 detected and installed drivers quickly without any issue.
3,They work but cannot connect HearLink hearing aids
5,Nada que señalar solo que funciona à la perfección.
5,Love itjust plug it and it's WORK!
5,Adding blue tooth to my PC
1,Poor/looses connection. Even when right close to the computer.
5,Just plugged it in and I have Bluetooth again on my laptop
