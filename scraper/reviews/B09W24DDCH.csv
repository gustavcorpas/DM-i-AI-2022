5,I’ve has this machine 10 days. It’s been used enough the sound signature has changed. It’s become a little more “open” with a broader soundstage. Bearing in mind I’m using the sennheiser hd600; a wonderful headphone but not a crazy big soundstage but accurate and sensitive. This headphone reveals flaws in sources source material and amplification. I have used this amplifier and headphone set up with two different dacs an emotiva xda-1 and an smsl Sanskrit 6 the analog outputs of a NAD compact disc player on the output of an X3 mk II docked Fiio k5 and with a schiit mani phono stage. It all sound terrific. This is my first exposure to tube sound since my childhood when the family held on to an old console television way too long. I was too young to understand what that meant at the time and I don’t believe that set ever sounded like the darkvoice. The DV reveals the music every bit as well as my Asgard 2 and a few times the sound was a little more highly resolved. The euphonic distortion of the tubes doesn’t hide anything. The sound was clear and without the echo I thought it would have. With both dacs the imaging was tight and with just a breath between instruments inversely connected to the NAD CD player and the Schiit mani phonostage with at3600 cartridge the sound was more expansive with more air between the instruments. This is perhaps my preferred way to listen to headphones anyway; nothing in between the source and the amplifier. Using the analog outputs on the k5 with the docked X3 mk II yields to my ears the most “compressed” sound. Still fantastic mind you just not as broad as the standalone dacs and nowhere near the sound of the NAD and the phonostage. That said I do think that combination does sacrifice a little tiny bit of accuracy for sound quality. The two dacs; to me sounded drier but just a little more detailed but the difference is slight at best.A note on power output. I own a pair of Koss pro4aa’s. These are 250 ohm resistance and are comparatively inefficient and I don’t have to take the volume pot past 10 o’clock for really loud sound. The darkvoice doesn’t fix what’s wrong about the pro4aa not that these are terrible headphones just not on the same level as the Sennheiser or even the Sony MDR-V6 (one of my personal favorites) but the darkvoice does add something. Some kind of tube sound voodoo to the way Koss presents. The DV pushes the mids further forward in what is kind of a v-shaped sound signature. Smooths out the treble and the bass while still forward isn’t as. Considering how old this design is they may have been designed to work with tube circuitry. They sound better to me being driven by the darkvoice versus my solid state options. And; with plenty of power. This makes me want to try other kind of older closed studio type designs that maybe have a recessed mid range as well with that higher resistance in the 250-600 ohm range. The beyerdynamics and the older AKG’s such as the 600 ohm 141 and 249 sextets that can still be had on eBay used for much less than the hd600. A used CD player Darkvoice and some used hard to drive vintage cans could be a great way to unwind.A few notes regarding build. It’s noted in other reviews that this is a heavy piece of equipment. My Asgard 2 is a hulk and hold one in each hand simultaneously: the DV is heavier. I haven’t dedicated large amounts of time to scrutinize the chassis but I’m betting it’s steel. Those clean sharp edges have almost got to be steel. The transformer cover is almost certainly steel as well and weight distribution front to back being my indication that transformer is big. There is no external hum to that transformer though and no audible “POP” externally or in the headphones when you throw the very positive power switch. The volume pot is smooth with just the right amount of resistance this pot won’t get twisted over without meaning to. On that subject the channel balance is spot on with this unit.The DV has a lot of proponents and detractors even those who love it talk about the tube causing an audible hum in the left channel. I don’t hear this. Not on the first listen and not now. I bought a “better” tube on purchase because of this and haven’t used it as these tubes actually sound pretty good. The sound signature is of course different from my Asgard 2 but it’s every bit as pleasant. Maybe more so in my humble opinion and I absolutely love the Asgard all the schiit products I’ve used have been top notch. I have to put the DV up there next to them in sound quality. I will be rolling other tubes as I see no reason not to. Trying out tubes has literally put new life into my music collection. I’m hearing everything sound just a little bit different than my SS gear and it’s a sound I find myself really liking. That said the tubes that came stock sound really good and if I didn’t have a way to procure other tubes I could be satisfied with the sound.Okay; time for a minor beef. The trim ring around the volume pot. I hate to even mention this because there’s all kinds of talk about the inferiority of Chinese products. The DV arrived at my house missing one of the very small and very likely proprietary hex bolts missing. One. It doesn't effect the function of the volume pot or the function of the amp. The trim ring isn’t lose and none of the other bolts are loose. After sending Shenzhen an email however I received and email in less than 8 hours (figure on the time difference I’m reasonably sure they don’t staff support 24/7; nor should they). I was asked a few questions and told they would ship a set of bolts to me. Now because the two people I received emails from were pleasant and professional and had a terrific grasp of my native tongue I have no doubt I will receive these parts as promised.There are a lot of products made of overseas that are garbage some American made products are garbage too. Anyone remember the Ford pinto? ‘Nuff said. This amplifier is not foreign made garbage. It’s a really good sounding amplifier with actually nice musical tubes of Russian and Chinese extraction from a company who’s customer support I’m already kind of impressed with. It’s a really great sounding amplifier as I said it’s different but every bit as pleasant as my Asgard 2.The price is right less than $300/shipped and can be found more inexpensive yet if one is willing to do the pay and wait on massdrop.I could really see being thrilled to own a good used CD player darkvoice amp HD 600’s and a whole bunch of compact discs as the only music system and being completely satisfied with that.Update: I'm really upset regarding this purchase. I'm upset with amazon. I won't be buying any other audio gear from here. Tonight; midtrack the darkvoice sound went kind of lifeless. I turned the volume pot ad found the pot had no influence over level switched it off with my headphones still on could still hear audio coming form it despite the tubes having stopped glowing. One minute the sound was exquisite the next it was not. I'll be returning the amp for refund having spent nearly 60 minutes on chat with an associate. The result being not as I'd like I'm told I'll be having to wait 14 days for my refund. Amazon has no problem deducting the funds immediately on shipment but getting your hard earned back for defective unit takes two weeks. I've email shenzhen and will see what they have to say and hope it's more satisfactory than Amazon's solution.***update 2: A few emails back and forth and having come to the agreement with Shenzhen to repair my amplifier and return it to me. Customs forms filled out and the Darkvoice on it’s way back to the P.R.C. having canceled my return to amazon. Shenzhen Audio customer service was accommodating professional and competent.**** The replacement Dark voice has been in my collection for a significant amount of time now. I've had multiple dealings with Shenzhen Audio for other components. All of them worth every penny. I've several other headphones amplifiers my home office looks like a shrine to them. The Darkvoice continues to be a significant amount of listening I do. Great for Classical Blues and Jazz. Solid state has it's place in my systems but the tube sound from this unit continues to move me in a way that solid state just doesn't. Shenzhen's customer service continues to impress.
4,I've been on a long hunt to essentially replicate the two piece Smart Cover case for my original iPad 2 and it has been very frustrating. With that iPad I used an Apple real leather Smart Cover with another vendor's soft gel back cover. It worked perfectly for my needs for three years. I assumed it wouldn't be difficult to get a similar solution for my brand new iPad Air but that was a wrong assumption. I really wanted genuine leather and I found that many cases that say "leather" mean PU leather which is a polyurethane coated leather derivative. Be aware of what you are buying if it matters to you.Apple no longer makes a real leather Smart Cover only a Smart Case that covers the back as well but it is $79.99 and it doesn't feel as much like real leather as I wanted. I thought I could do better. I wanted sleep/wake function with the cover I wanted the back protected with something that would keep the iPad from slipping on a desk or other surface and I wanted to be able to easily use the iPad in the lower propped up typing position as I use the virtual screen keyboard about 95% of the time. When I travel and have to do a great deal of writing I take a separate Bluetooth keyboard with me. And I wanted the case to be red preferably.This case was one I did buy but returned:CaseCrown Bold Standby Pro Case (Red) for Apple iPad Air with Sleep / Wake Hand Grip Corner Protection & Multi-Angle Viewing Stand $16.99 ASIN: B00BISWNLC. Impressive protection nicely made but same frame problem faux leather.This ended up being the the last case I bought and kept: StilGut Couverture Genuine Leather Case for Apple iPad Air with Smart-Cover Function Red ASIN: B00GXCJ8LQ It is bright red it is beautifully crafted and it securely holds the iPad Air without covering any of the edges of the iPad Air's screen what I call the "frame" around the screen.This case has a fairly stiff back cover that grips the iPad Air quite securely. The entire iPad is covered in red leather and the case is lined in black suede or suede like fabric with the StilGut name woven or stamped in. All buttons and ports are open and useable. The red color is beautiful and exactly the red color I sought. It also comes with a two year warranty and feels better made than the Apple Smart Case at the same price. My only quibble is that I would have preferred to have had smooth textured calfskin or similar not the textured leather this case is made with. But it seems I couldn't have everything I wished and this beautiful case came the closest.I've found that many cases do count on the iPad being secured by the case itself using pieces of leather or faux leather to cover the frame showing only the screen. But that type of frame prevents my thumbs from easily reaching the virtual spacebar and prevents me from typing effectively.The StilGut company is a new one to me but is apparently a highly regarded German firm long established. I feel very confident that should any issue arise during the two year warranty period they will stand behind their product. Their website shows many products for tablets and phones in many colors and styles.These are the other iPad Air cases I tried bought and returned. The AISN number is Amazon's in house stock number and you can find any of these cases by doing a search with that number.i-Blason 5th Generation i-Folio Slim Hard Shell Stand Case Cover for Apple iPad Air (iPad5-iFolio-Red) $24.99 ASIN: B00G3NDFW8 (grip holding the iPad Air was right but I didn't love the texture).Jisoncase Red Genuine Leather Smart Cover Case for iPad Air JS-ID5-01C30 $74.99 ASIN: B00GNXJK0O but ended up returning it read further to learn why.

4,After having a poor experience with a hybrid tube amp I decided to try an OTL Tube with my HD 600 and DT 880 600 Ohm.It's packaged pretty sparsely with molded foam clam shell for the amp with cutouts for the stock tubes in a plain cardboard box. Also a manual and a 1/4" adapter.I actually didn't bother with the stock tubes almost immediately swapping in a GE-branded JAN Power Tube and an Electro Harmonix Pre-amp Tube from Parts Express. I later swapped in a Sovtek from Tube Depot for the Pre-amp Tube.The amp changes it's sound based on what's plugged into it. Everything changes it. The HD 600 sounded smeared but quite well pleasant with the EH tube and seemed to have more visceral bass. The Sovtek tube sounded cleaner and clearer much closer to solid state with less bass impact but more than solid state gear.If you're purchasing this you know what you're buying I hope. It's not meant for low-impedance headphones. It can drive the Beyer 600 Ohm cans at less than 12-o-clock on the volume knob with the DAC at -3dB. It's a piece of gear that just sounds noticeably different than standard (solid state) gear.However there's a few potential issues. The engineering is suspect. Like it's probably safe but I don't touch it with more than one hand at a time for safety. Beyond that the front LED is basically dead after about a week. Further still there's a hum in one of the channels if you just plug in new tubes and start playing audio. That's due to an improperly specced PSU for 120v US Mains from what I can dredge up. You can solve the issue by removing the power tube and installing the pre-amp tube and then letting the amp run like that for 24-72 hours that is unless you want to dig into the guts and start modding it. WHICH I DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING.If you know what you're doing it might be worth going for a Bottlehead Crack +/- the Speedball Upgrade. You'll learn a lot more about how amps work and you'll be supporting an American company if that matters to you.However this is an amp that allows you to hear different sounds than solid state gear  play with different tubes of various price points and works perfectly well after some break-in. Oh and you don't have to assemble it from parts. Because of that it gets a recommendation from me with the caveat that you have high impedance headphones and know this isn't designed for ultimate cleanliness of the sound. It's designed to mess with it and it does it well.Disclaimer: My ears are not a measurement rig and I DO NOT recommend you opening this amplifier up for any reason unless you know what you're doing and how to be safe. YMMV as per usual based on your tubes headphones DAC and source files.
4,Airpods are too expensive and sound quality doesn't matter unless you're listening to music.  I'm listening to podcasts mostly and these are really good.  When I do listen to music they are still really good.  They make airpods completely not worth the money.
4,Never knew pulling in head phones could be Bluetooth buh they are lol they’re loud love it
4,Only one worked but for the price I didn't complain still a steal of a deal. Sounds normal and the child doesn't hear me when they are in so obviously work well
5,My husband uses them to listen to audio books.  He thinks they will be great when we go on vacation and are on the airplane.
4,It’s decent
3,I didn’t think these had to be bluetooth connected since its a lightning cord so keep that in mind before buying (and they love to disconnect at the slightest movement of a limb if its in a pocket
4,I bought it mainly to record some songs didn’t care much about the quality but since it’s a “bluetooth” headphone the app I use doesn’t allow in-ear monitor and there’s a delay between the track and the vocal.
4,Let me start by saying this is probably the best value OTL tube amp you're going to find. With that being said it is far from a refined piece of audio equipment. You'll find the circuit design for the preamp tube is quite frankly bad. It gives off a horrible 60Hz hum that makes your music unlistenable with some tubes (stock tubes are fine). This is because of a missing heater center tap which many people have ended up modifying with resistors or capacitors. So no center tap and no ground reference in the circuit is poor design... you may have to modify the internals to get the most out of it sadly. Hopefully Darkvoice updates their design at some point it is 100% an issue with the listening experience and will affect certain tubes if you decide to tube roll. But this seems to have been an issue with their amp for at least a decade.A lot of people say the stock tubes are horrible and to replace them right away. They are cheap but quite honestly they sounded decent. Definitely wouldn't worry about replacing the power tube (6AS7 tube) immediately. I did eventually try out a couple Russian tubes which hummed unbearably (see above) and a nice Chinese tube (Shuguang CV181-Z) which sounds amazing. If you buy this amp just keep in mind that many of the tubes you try out will have a 60Hz hum unless you modify your Darkvoice. Once you find the right setup with the right headphones (might take some experimenting just don't use low impedance headphones) this will give you everything you're looking for in a tube amp. Warm lush smooth sound; extended bass rolled off treble many other musical qualities you won't find in solid state amps...
3,The headphones worked great for a few months then one earpiece has stopped working. I am using it just with one working bud. And the cord must be broken because if I move it too close to the input part the volume control goes wild on its own. Worked great for about 2 months.
3,They start out at a ridiculously high volume and you can’t lower it so basically you’re getting yelled at as soon as you plug them in. They’re not really useable.
3,At first I would’ve rated as 5/5 but today is my third time using the ear buds and I noticed when a video was done playing and I was searching for something else to watch an annoying static buzzing sound was happening. I to the plug out and replaced it in by flipping it over. Same thing. Noise cancellation would be decent as well if it wasn’t for the static noise in your ear. I tried lowering the volume to see if it’d silence it but even all the way down it was horrible.
5,I couldn’t hear the noise cancellation
3,I walk daily and catch up on phone calls during that time. I find that the traffic gets in the way of comfortable conversation. I thought these earphones would help. I was wrong. I heard static in one of the headsets and absolutely nothing in the other. I plan to return this purchase.
5,Update 10/30/2019 ****************************After trying dozens of different tubes both 6SN7s and 6AS7s I can say this amp has wildly exceeded my expectations.  I listen mostly to Rock EDM (Electronic Dance Music) Punk Metal and the tubes I finally settled on are the Tung-Sol 7236 for the Power Tube (6AS7) and the Philips JAN 6SN7WGTA.  Lovely combination with deep controlled bass yet sweet midrange and defined highs.  Absolutely amazing combination.For other 6SN7 tubes try these:  KEN-RAD JAN-CKR-6SN7GT Sylvania Chrome top 6SN7WFor other 6AS7 tubes try these: Chatham Electronics CAHG 6AS7G RCA JAN 6AS7G.You can basically tune this amp to your particular musical preferences and hearing tastes by rolling various tubes to see which ones sound best to you.I had read some very glowing reviews for this Darkvoice 336SE headphone amp and decided to go ahead and try it.And boy am I glad I did!What a fantastic amp.  I have an Intel Skull Canyon PC with 512GB SSD M.2 drive 16GB RAM as my main digital music server.  Next is a Topping D50 DAC and then finally this Darkvoice amp with a set of OPPO Digital PM 3 headphones..After about 48 hours of burn-in  I began.  With a selection of my favorite CDs ripped in FLAC and stored on the SSD as well as a decent few files downloaded in DSD and MQA format I started listening.I was expecting a slightly slow blooming sound with rolled off treble but even with these stock tubes it sounds great.  All I can comment on is the combination I am running so I can't separate the sound of the DAC from the sound of the amp and the sound of the headphones yet (at some point I will swap all components to see if I can figure out the sound signature of each part of the chain).With strings brass and upper drum sounds this is lovely.  Lots of detail warm without being too warm for my tastes.  The treble is fantastic not harsh bright or too shimmery just right.  The mid and low bass is slightly too bloomy for me; it needs tightening up but there is PLENTY of it.  Kick drums are less snappy than I tend to hear on my solid state amps but I have a bunch of new (NOS) tubes coming in to test and I am told by people who have had this amp for longer than I have that the tubes can make a massive difference.For less than $300 this is a ridiculous bargain and it's a lovely sweet amp.  Well built quiet and quite frankly way more than I had bargained for.O.K.  Off to try some new tubes in it.
3,They sound grate but they’re Bluetooth to turn them on you have to plug them to your phone the only problem with that is that is you accidentally move the cord weird or your phone they turn off and it’s kinda annoying
2,The good part: these are super comfortable and fit my ears like they were custom made.The bad part: literally everything else.The wires are as thin as threads and the sound is even thinner. There is no bass whatsoever (and I don’t mean thump-thump bass just low end notes) and I have to turn the volume up to full in order for them to be as loud as my original Apple earbuds at half.I hate most silicone in-ear earbuds because they just don’t fit my ears no matter how good they sound. These are the opposite. If I could find some decent earbuds in this form factor I’d buy out the store. It’s a shame; I really wanted to like these.
3,Good headphones... but unfortunately the person I bought them for found them extremely uncomfortable so I think you need to either like this style of earbud without the cushion or it needs to fit your ear perfectly. It looks nice and fits in the lightning port so that's obviously a plus..
3,For some reason they emit beeping sounds every so often.  So not top quality.  You get what you pay for.  I find the earpiece fits my ear very well so I am happy with that.  The beeps go away after a while.
5,These earbuds do the job. They aren’t fancy but they work great and don’t hurt my ears.
3,The sound quality is good and so is the noise cancellation. These are great if you just want to listen. They suck on voice calls. Even with the sound at its max it’s hard for others to hear you
4,I just received my earbuds. No problems connecting but only the right side is working. Is there a trick to get them to play in stereo?
3,Bad connection
3,The Converter is well built and sturdy.  I was disappointed however that for the price it did not come with a power supply but only a power cable.On the positive side when I encountered the problems described below the vendor was extremely responsive and helpful but in the end I still couldn't get it to work.  I couldn't have asked for better support.The problem was my video source was a Roku which the Converter would NOT play "nice" with (even though I tried multiple Roku models including the Stick and the Roku Premier).  There seems to be an incompatibility in the Converter's support of  the HDMI output from the Rokus.  The result is intermittent but continual HDCP (Content Protection) errors that pop up every 5-10 minutes.  They only last for a few seconds but it is very irritating and always seem to happen just at a critical and exciting moment in every script !!!  :-(Unfortunately the Content Protection algorithms don't just happen once but continuously.  What seems to be happening is the Converter can't keep up with the continuous streams of CP Check Sums sent by the Roku and misses responding to an occasional burst thus causing a momentary HDCP error which recovers in a second when the next check transmission occurs but during that time there is a full-screen HDCP ERROR message on the TV screen.I think I have found a low cost ($21.99) HDMI to Component Video converter alternative on Amazon that so far has been working properly for a day.  Hopefully that success continues over time.
3,Caution:  these are powered via the lightening cord but actually connect via Bluetooth. If you don’t want to connect via Bluetooth don’t buy these.
3,Idek
3,Vino uno quebrado el cable
4,Works really well.
3,Cheap
5,I like hers for the price. No echo or fuzziness. Clear sound.
3,I would have been very disappointed if I bought these to listen to music.They are just barely acceptable for the spoken word.
3,These will stay in your ear if you are not moving around biking or running. They are not very comfortable and you always have to secure them repeatedly. Not my choice of ear piece
2,Uno de los audífonos comprados llegó dañado con la base del conector flojo y desprendido. El sonido no es el mejor debido a un daño en el cableado. No esperaba un producto top pero no duró ni dos días. El otro audífono por el momento funciona sin ningún inconveniente.Poco recomendado.
3,There is a delay in the sound when sound first starts and then it plays over itself to catch up. Not very good quality but works nonetheless.
5,The sound quality is fine nothing to write home about. Noise cancellation is average. The reason why I rated these so high is because these suckers went through the wash and still work just fine! Of course I don’t recommend putting any sort of technology through the wash but if you have to I recommend these.
4,You have to connect to these in your bluetooth settings after plugging into phone. If you try just plugging them in they will not work correctly.
5,Pros:  Ease of use small size dual connectivity optionsCons:  High price no USB power adapterI purchased this so I could connect a slingbox 350 I had laying around to my DirecTV Genie.  Unfortunately the Genie does not have Component Out only HDMI. So I purchsed thi HDMI to Compornent. Also I needed to still have HDMI out so that I could keep the Genie connected to my tv for viewing when the slingbox is not in use.Setup was very easy. Just plug in the HDMI in source from the Genie to this switch. Then hook up the Slingbox via component and the TV via HDMI out.While somewhat pricey at $79.99 it was the only solution I could find that does both HDMI and Component out and is compact in size.  Strangely at this price it does not come with a power supply. It has a micro-USB to USB cable but no power adapter so I had to supply that. Luckily I had an extra one that I could use for it.  But at $80.00 they really should include a power adapter.Overall I am happy with my purschase and would recommend this product for those who need both an HDMI and component video out switch with devices that ony have HDMI out.
2,These work if you don’t care about the audio quality or microphone lag.I don’t notice the quality as much when watching videos but it is hard to ignore the poor quality when listening to music.I tried filming a TikTok while listening to the track with them and there is about a full second delay between the audio provided and the microphone catching my voice. I have troubleshooted a bit and attempted to use both pairs.This was surprising but I suppose you get what you pay for. These are probably fine if you don’t like music or film videos.
5,I bought this so that I could display the image from my Spectrum Analyzer (SA) on one of my computer monitors and it does that very well. It also solves a problem with the external display almost perfectly.The composite video out from my SA if run directly to an external monitor or TV will exhibit a significant amount of overshoot a common problem with this type of equipment. As a result I've been using the internal screen which as the amber picture shows has a bit of screen burn.This inexpensive little box solves that thanks to its MODE button. The SIENOC has a variety of resolution and screen ratios a couple of which correct the overshoot problem with the exception of some text at the very top of the screen. And the image is good enough for radio work. I can simply scroll through the various resolutions until I find one that suits me. So this works very well for me.Another advantage is that when I shut down my computer at night I sometimes forget to hit my master workbench switch leaving AC power on to two monitors two power supplies and other equipment. The monitors used to go dark so I didn't realize that I had done that. The SIENOC defaults to a pure blue screen making it obvious that I've forgotten to turn off the power.I haven't tried all of its functions but I would definitely recommend this to techs who have a similar problem. In fact I'll probably post pictures of it on my w3afc.com web page.
5,Good quality easy to use.
3,One of the pair of ear buds doesn’t work I’ve tried everything
5,OMG!!! What did I just hear...was my immediate reaction. I have quite a few pairs of headphones but through my sennheiser hd650's on this thing put on a senatra song and proceeded to have my mind blown...BLOWN I tell you I just pulled this out of the box about an hour ago and felt absolutely compelled to let you guys and anybody else that will listen know this requires no burn in or tube rolling (changing tubes) to sound amazing I really didn't even let the tubes warm up like people say to it was only a couple of minutes before I got everything else set up and it sounds amazing. As for what does it does to the sound I'll try to explain it a bit but I feel like everybody wondering about this just has to try one so I feel like at least with my 650's it seems to bring the upper mids more forward but also adds some I guess color there to and it definitely widens the soundstage not crazy but definitely perfect amount for this set of cans and it does something with the bass to I don't know exactly what I haven't gone straight back and forth from any of my solid states then back to the tube but I feel like there is no need to because there is a very clear difference to me in the sound I'll update once I have more hours on this under my belt I'm sure it's not perfect for everything but so far I'm in love. Oh yeah and absolutely dead quiet when no music is playing and no background noise no matter the volume level if you experience different I would exchange it for another one but anybody seriously considering one of these I would just bite the bullet these are going away and prices gonna go up for sure as soon as there harder to find I feel like I stole this amp at 319.99 look around there is nothing in this class at this price don't even mention the little dot not in a comparison to the darkvoice if I spent a thousand dollars on this I would have felt like it gave me my money's worth I've spent that on a single pair of headphones before and was let down but not this time.
2,I don’t like that it sounds very muffled on the phone calls and sometimes I have to replug it in for everything to be heard after I connect to my phone.
2,Most of the time they wouldn’t connect to my phone or were unrecognizable to my phone Bluetooth. On both pairs one ear bud had terrible sound and barely worked.
2,I guess you get what you pay for the first set of ear buds failed the same day my wife started using them the second set failed about a week after she started using them. Don’t buy them - waste of money.
2,I bought these and one set didn’t work with any of our phones and the one set that did work just stopped working after a few weeks. They did not get used a lot maybe a couple days a week.
5,The sound is great I love them!
5,These work well when you can’t use air pods. They hook into the charger port. I have no idea how long the charge  last. That would depend on your listening time. The sound is really good.
3,Broke easy
3,Diria que estuvo bn
5,I received the Darkvoice 336SE on time and packaged very well. I replaced the tubes included with NOS RCA tubes (6AS7 and 6SN7GTB). There was some odd discharge around the cathode for a couple of seconds as it heated up - appeared to be some residual gasses burning off - typical from the tube manufacture process but still I replaced it with an RCA NOS 6AS7G tube.Very good sound now that the tubes have burned in some - I only expect the sound to get better as the audio tube (6SN7GTB) further ages. I use this amp with my Sennheiser HD 650's. Very good sound throughout the spectrum. I have also listened to sine wave sweeps from 5hz through 30khz and there are no dead spots in the sound.All in all a very good amp at it's price point. Frankly I think if some of the higher end more expensive makers they are likely more difficult to discern - I can't see how much can improve on what this amp delivers. I have been an audiophile all my life and have listened to many different set ups.--Follow up: It's now over a year later and I absolutely love this amp. I'm still using the NOS RCA 6AS7G along with an Electro-Harmonix 6SN7EH gold pin. I use it daily with either my Sennheisers or to feed my Rokit RP5 L/R satellites + RP10S 225W subwoofer. Full details on the setup: Focusrite Scarlett 2i4 USB sound card as DAC feeding into the Line In of the Darkvoice 336 which feeds the Rokit near field reference monitors and sub-woofer.I've listened to all kinds of music including 24/96 and higher FLAC files etc. My favorite recording is a 1959 recording of Sheherazade Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Pure audio gold.
2,Both sets were completely broken and dead in like two weeks
4,I bought this for my mother thinking it was like mine but didn't realize it is required to have rechargeable batteries. When i read the description my understanding was that you can either charge it with wall charger or use batteries. My mother had some difficulty using. But i finally was able to teach her and get it to work for her. Since it requires batteries there should be markings on the device on how they should be placed. It works fine but it was more expensive than mine and the one i have is actually much better. I would've just gotten the same one had i known there were these differences.
5,I looked at A LOT of Apple earbuds before I decided to go with this double set. And I’m so glad that I did! The sound is great and I like the idea that they have the cord so I don’t lose one of them. So far I’ve only listened to music with them. I haven’t tried to use them for talking on the phone yet. But that is next on the list of to do! And the bargain itself is unbelievable! 2 for practically the price of 1! Highly recommend!😃
2,I bought these thinking they were regular headphones nd i see wen i connect it to my phone mfn beats pop up
3,They are inexpensive; the sound is not awful.
2,One pair has an earbud that is louder than the other earbud and there’s no way that I've found to fix it.
4,In many ways this vacuum tube classic is a 5 star product.But don’t buy it unless you also have an autotransformer of some sort to lower the USA mains voltage of 126-130V to the 110V this amp is designed for.Some of the reviews about this amp burning up may be due to ignoring this!Even at 110V this beauty runs warm.The large 6N5P power tube is a real stove! If you don’t have at least some experience with tube amps don’t start with this one!Start with some of the hybrid models or maybe the Little Dot MK2 if you are braver.The tubes are a very tight fit into the sockets. As to the soundYES!: I love the clangoryness of listening to Keith Jarrett whaling away on solo piano on this!
2,They work fine. For some reason it forces you to connect them through Bluetooth even though it’s a wired connection?The audio quality is fine. But there’s thus constant and consistent loud buzzing-static sound. Very annoying and hurts my ears after a while. I believe the static gets quieter when you listen to some other audio with them.Wouldn’t buy again.
2,Product works well for music but not for phone conversations.
5,Hum hum hum.  It sounds good when the music is playing unless its a quiet passage of music and u can hear the static hum.  Between tracks hum and when nothing is playing there is hum.  I don't know why but if spend 300+ I would expect it to be silent.  I changed tubes to nos and it didn't fix the hum at all. In some cases it made it worse.  I aged the driver tube as suggested by manufacturer and it still hums.  It does sound good when it is playing music but the hum thing really irks me.  Hope this helps you.  The amp is built like a tank and looks great sitting anywhere.  A real attention grabber it is!!  Maybe the hum issue can be resolved but I don't know.  Does anyone else have the hum issue with their amp??UPDATE FOR THIS ITEM.  Ok folks here is the skinny.  The hum was aggravating me like crazy.  So did the Fitz mod and it didn't work.  Still driving me crazy.  Then it dawned on me to add a cheater plug to the power cord and BAM JUST LIKE THAT AMP IS DEAD SILENT.  NOT A PEEP AND I AM NO LONGER AGGRAVATED.  IT SOUNDS AMAZING FOR REAL AND QUIET QUIET QUIET.  You can get a cheater plug for less than a dollar.  Do it u won't be sorry.  Amazing amp.  Thank you
5,Not sure why I saw a number of negative reviews glad I did not read reviews prior to purchasing just got tired of my wireless headphones dying on me and ordered these. These headphones have good bass and great sound a very good value for the price. I even ordered another pair. These are definitely worth a try.
4,About a year ago DirecTV had enabled HDCP on their cableboxes.  What this did to my setup was make my Slingbox no longer work through the HDMI port.  I was either stuck with lower quality live tv running everything through component cables or I would have to sacrifice the Slingbox.  I thought that there was not a single working converter until I ran into this one.  This works perfectly with the DirecTV Genie Samsung 46A630 TV and my Slingbox 500.  Only downside is the relatively high price of $70.Setup:The DirecTV unit hooks up to this device via HDMI this device hooks up the the TV via HDMI and hooks up the the Slingbox via Component.  The unit gets powered by a spare USB slot from the TV.Prior Units that I tried:  Portta HDMI to YPbPr Component Adapter         - Would not convert the signal to my Slingbox.ZAMO1x2 Powered 1080P V1.4 Certified HDMI Splitter - No longer being sold by Amazon - probably because it did not work.
5,Didn’t know how to charge
3,One of the headphones didn’t work at all🙄
4,Once I made a couple of tech support calls to both Slingbox and Spectrum I was finally able to get the adapter installed on my new cable box. My biggest criticism is that other than the adapter power cord (why only USB power source?) and a short HDMI cable there was nothing in the box. Upon following instructions for connecting from the picture on the product listing and from someone else’s review it appeared that only 3 of the 4 lights were working. Turned out that didn’t matter but some paperwork like even a pamphlet explaining it might have been helpful as I reconnected and used different cords thinking something was not right. Reconfiguring the Slingbox was also necessary but warning for Spectrum customers good luck finding your model manufacturer and your remote. Ended up the remote for mine is still listed as a Time Warner universal. Too many phone calls for what should have been a maximum 10 minute installation. Now let’s hope it continues to work when I go south for the winter.
5,The sound is a little off when your on FaceTime but other than that it’s 10/10
2,I was so excited to get these because they were foam and I thought I stood a better chance of using them more effectively than the hard ones that came with my iPhone but they weren’t.
2,The title is very misleading I specifically bought these to stop using Bluetooth headphones due to EMF. I find out that these are wired Bluetooth headphones. How stupid.
5,After buying probably $150 worth of branded Apple lightning buds because the kiddo cant keep up with anything decided to give these cheapos a go. Works fantastic for youtube videos and cant beat the price.
2,Not what I expected. Connects by Bluetooth they are not regular wired head phones.
2,I dislike the call quality of the headphones .  The sound quality is alright.
2,THIS MUCH IS STILL TRUE FROM MY INITIAL REVIEWS:  This device took four hours to charge my Sony NPFZ100 battery from zero to 45 percent even though the chart that came with the device indicated a maximum of four hours to fully charge a battery.  After a total of about nine hours the charge was complete and the indicator light turned from red to green.LATE INFORMATION:  Based on having charged two genuine Sony NPFZ100 batteries several times I would estimate it takes 8 hours to 9 hours to charge that battery from zero to 100 percent.  That's certainly slow but not prohibitively slow considering how long these greatly improved (and larger) Sony batteries last during use in the camera.LATEST INFORMATION:  Now this charger will not charge one of my genuine Sony NPFZ100 batteries up to 100 percent -- it stops at 97 percent no matter how much time elapses.  Then I charged that battery in the camera -- and it increased to 100 percent no problem. So I have to wonder about the circuitry etc. of this product.  I am going back to a two-star rating.
5,Cables cost nothing to manufacture and "quality" is nothing more than a few millimeters of insulation and proper (cheap) materials.  This cable functions adequately and is priced appropriately.The difference between a $100 cable and a $50 cable is the sucker buying it.  Probability is that the $50 cable is identical to the $100 cable - both manufactured by the same Chinese company and re-branded by two different resellers.The hazard of cheap cables is that the most horribly cheap cables will receive and transmit interference to other cables/devices e.g. static lines or similar aberrations in picture/sound quality.  Solution:  Buy a few notches up from horribly cheap and stay with insanely cheap.  A consumer does NOT need to pay more than $5 or $10 to obtain a quality cable that will not transmit/receive interference.  HDMI signals are not strong enough to penetrate relatively weak insulation - a toaster transmits more interference.The bad news for consumers is that most HDMI cable sellers will not give you enough data on the product to determine if it is sufficient (no standardized interference rating material description insulation type/thickness).  The good news is that Amazon users will tell you if they are having difficulty.I should add that (in the unlikely case) if you are routing hdmi cable over more than 5m you will want to look into significantly better cables however.  Running HDMI over lengths beyond just a few meters will cause severe signal loss.  This tends to happen when you are *not* installing the input devices (DVD/Blu-ray home theater equipment) adjacent to the TV - such as routing the cable behind walls ceilings and/or floorspaces.
4,Appears to be a high quality unit. Would be nice if they included a power feed breakout adaptor (feeding DC into the signal path where downstream receivers are used.) An AC adaptor with a type F connector and a short RG6 cable are provided to be used with the DC only power port. I used this for about 1/2 day to get signals up to the point I could optimize my antenna position (using a DIGIAIR PRO ATSC meter). Later I solved another problem and decided not to use this amp in this installation. The separate DC power feed port can be used or a combo RF/DC power port (which requires use of optional DC feed adaptor). I have an active antenna and I would require a separate path of DC power to the DC port of the antenna. The AC coupled output  could be fed into this Amp for more gain. Turns out I did not need the complication. Will keep this in case I need additional gain for certain ATSC measurements. Nice unit for the price.
5,I upgraded my Fios system VMS1100  to their latest unit with voice control a VMS4100... to my surprise there weren’t any component connections on the new unit. These are required for my Slingbox to work. I deinstalled the units and was disappointed that I wasn’t going to get to keep them as my Slingbox is a key item for me with my vacation home overseas. I started doing a bunch of searches on what I could do... Finally found your converter list on the Slingbox site I think it was an old page but it had a video clip showing this in action. I tried to order it from them for $79 however it routed me to Amazon for the purchase and the cost was even more... I needed it and had no other choice. Got the converter installed it and everything this works great now.... Please note the VMS4100 is not listed in the Slingbox setup just choose the Arris VMS1100 and it will work fine... The 3 stars on value for the money was for the price against similar converters... I am very happy with the outcome and the converter!!!
2,They are corded but connect via Bluetooth. The say beats when they come on but baets after connected lol it’s funny actually. The wires are the cheapest plastic you’ll find. I wouldn’t but then again.
3,Utterly absurd pricing and Guts Parker is selling these on eBay for even MORE absurd pricing. But this company is smart for exploiting this. Your options are;1. Not install an M.2 drive. Not good.2. Write to your mobo manufacturer and prove that you bought the board then wait A LONG TIME for them to send you the M.2 standoff with screws. But who wants to wait that long? Amazon Prime is 1-2 days out especially with such a light item.3. Chance it by trying to find this at a hardware store. Good luck and time=money.If someone could work out how to make these they could sell them for a more reasonable price assuming they don't already sell them at hardware stores though I wouldn't assume such a thing since it's tiny computer hardware.I got some from ASRock WAY after I needed them. So I fell into the GutsParker trap too. Does the standoff and screw fit my ASRock board? Yes. Was I happy to pay about $14 for a teeny tiny standoff and screw? No. Am I going to sell the ones I got from ASRock and undercut Guts on eBay? Yes. :D
1,For some reason I kept losing the wired headphones that came with older iPhone models. I decided to give these a try the main reason is because the original wired apple headphones kept falling out of my ears. I thought these would be a good substitute. Nope. First off you plug it in like a wired headset but you have to connect to Bluetooth. Why?? Because the iPhone recognizes it as “Beats by Dre” which the product says nothing about and when you connect it it says “Baets”! 🤣 It’s best to just put down another $10 and buy the original Apple pair. Also the sound quality sounds like it’s from 2010 lol. If you’re in DESPERATE need… these will be okay but … I don’t think it’s worth it. I’d say the only pro is that it blocks noise somewhat okay. You may ask why did I go this length to do a long review for some cheap headphone knockoffs from China… but for those who know how decently good the original headphones are trying to buy a substitute like this will only end up being a huge disappointment. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
5,Buena cálida
2,These earphones are a great bargain. Great price for two pair. That’s probably the only good thing about them. Sound quality is terrible. My music would sound muffled and my phone calls would sound muffled on both ends.
2,They broke so easily. Don’t recommend.
5,I bought a ASUS B350-F motherboard a few months back and didn't own any M.2 drives. Didn't even think to check for what ended up being a missing little screw and standoff. I just took what I needed and held on to the boxes along with my 15 other boxes of stuff for my PC that were laying around my room. Fast forward a few months later when Crucial had a deal for a 1tb M.2 SSD at the same price as a 2.5". My Newegg return window just closed and I would have to go to the trouble of trying to get the manufacturer's warranty and disassemble my PC pack it up ship it and wait while my computer isn't usable in hopes of getting a replacement. As if they can't just send out a penny's worth of metal.Apparently these things are hard to get a hold of so I looked on Amazon and dealt with GutsParker's price gouging and just bought it. I almost considered writing an email and sending it out to all the major motherboard manufacturers pretending I bought a motherboard from them to see if they would ship me one since Asus support is just a congregation of thumb-twiddling troglodytes. $14 is worth avoiding the hassle I guess.
2,They worked fine for a few weeks and then one side quit. A few weeks later the other side stopped working. It must be a wiring issue and possibly how I unplug them
2,They are very comfortable but the noice cancellation is slim and the sound quality is just horrible. Sounds like it’s coming from 20 miles away. Shoulda kept with the apple hard ones
4,I bought this for a 60 inch tv. It was not too difficult to install....I did it by myself. I also tried to put the tv on the mount by myself. That was not a good idea. It is very difficult to line up the hooks on the mount with the tv by yourself. After several attempts I was able to do it but I don't recommend it. The tv was heavy and I could have damaged it in the process. But I am stubborn and wanted it done lol. The titling feature is a bit weird. you really have to choose the tilt angle before you hang the tv on it and also make sure you really tighten the screws that secure the angle. basically my angle changed when I put the tv up and was pretty impossible to change it by myself. but the tilt is not bad at all so I left it as is. The tv seems very well secured and I have not had any problems with it even when my dogs are banging around the house. Overall a good buy.
1,I’d like to return these headphones I bought.  I may be past the due time but it’s because I bought these for a trip to Italy and on the trip discovered that they don’t work at all both pairs.One of them just messes with the volume and goes silent can’t hear anything no volume control.  The other pair has so much static it’s not comfortable to listen to music.  I’m back from my trip now and would like a return please.
5,I bought the pair one for my husband and myself for a flight. For $20 for 2 we didn't expect a lot but they were surprisingly good sound and light. I would recommend.
2,After plugging it into the phone it makes noises like it’s shorting out on and off. The noise canceling feature is zero. I can clearly hear someone from 30 feet away have a casual conversation.
2,One of the buds were broken in the package. But the other pair of headphones work properly. Just disappointed that the other headphones were unable to be used.
5,My unit sounded great right out of the box. NO HUM. But I ordered upgrade tubes BEFORE I recieved the unit. That's what I  get from reading "critical" reviews. And.....mine doesn't need the "wiring upgrade" that some have done to get rid of the hum. There simply is no hum. Now the upgraded tubes give it a more forward or bright sound. All this talk about "soundstage" and feeling "inside" with tube upgrades.....please. I have been playing bass for 40 plus yrs and tubes do make a subtle difference at times using an SVE I know just a smidgen about tube sound.If it ain't broke don't fix it.
3,I have gone through a lot of covers on multiple models of iPads (123 and Air). I chose this one for the corner protector feature and because I wanted something light weight that would slide into my purse and be easy to hold for reading.  On the latter part I do love the shape. The stitching started to come undone and the spine started to crack within 60 days which would knock this down to 4 stars.I'm giving 3 stars though because the most important feature of a cover is protection.  In normal household/office usage I somehow managed to bang the on-off switch which turned the button non-functional. (I had insurance so Apple replaced the device for free thank goodness.) There was a tiny mar on the metal. I don't know how hard a bump the device had to take (I don't remember it happening so probably not much) and I can't imagine how the cover could be formed to avoid such a mishap but the fact remains that the edge was damaged.  I'm not going any lower than 3 stars because who knows maybe a lot more damage would have been done by that one mishap or by any other handling in the 6 months I've had it.
2,The headphones did not work well with my iPhone. The sound quality was horrible. There was a constant static in the headphones. This package is a two pack and neither pair worked. We tried the headphones in other phones as well with the same result.
2,I wanted simple headphones that plugged into my phone. You have to connect these via Bluetooth. Waste of money for me. May be what others desire.
5,Thanks to this cable from Amazon that can always provide us an alternative cheap but also durable product to repurpose old speakers with our newer phones. I use this with the new ( to me who recently upgraded from 7 plus) iPhone XR and so far so good on the audio and recognizes this a certified cable.  I don’t hear any sound quality issues and sounds clear with these old loud bass speakers. I like this because I don’t need to attach to additional adapters.  The jacket is a silver black braided cording that helps protect the cable while lying on the wooden table.
4,I like these cases. This is the 3rd one I have ordered. I order a new one about every two years when the old one shows its age. I'm slightly less satisfied (maybe a half a star) because of the redesign to accommodate different iPad designs. There are holes and cutouts that are not necessary for my iPad. I particularly don't like the cutout surrounding the home button which where I usually grip the iPad to pick it up. So instead of picking up the iPad by the protective case I'm touching the iPad directly. Again not a big big deal but I liked the older design better.
5,I have an older home theater with a lovely Dwin projector and Sony ES etc. I am a 4K fiend and have a plex full of 4k content and wanted to be able to watch my library in the HT even if it was going to be downsampled to 720p. EVERYTHING I tried did not work HDMI to VGA HDMI to DVI HDMI to component even the CRT standard HDMI 1x2 to HDMI to VGA to projo NOTHING could break the HDCP. But finally I was thinking about moving my sling to another room so I could watch my MAG box anywhere when I saw on slingbox's website this device. I had debated ripping out the 10 year old system and going full atmos down there too but since it was so sparingly used I didn't really want to spend another 5-6k for the occasional film when this DWIN really did look great even at 720p. But nope! this guy was two plugs and done seriously so quick. I'm not even using the HDMI passthrough on it just stripping the HDCP and enjoying my Plex on the big screen.Well worth the 70$!
4,I'm not very technical. I purchased my iPad about 4 years ago and I'm not sure what model it is. My iPad has several cracks from being dropped by my 9 year old. I repaired it once and it was costly. This time it is what it is! That's why I ordered this case. It is exactly as described. Just one problem my iPad seems to be too big for the case. It hangs out a little at the bottom so that I can't really close it all the way. I didn't return it simply because that's not the sellers fault it's mine for not knowing the model. I live in Hawaii and the shipping would make it too much of a hassle. The cracks are covered and my iPad is secure. The cover is sturdy and I love the color. When I fold the cover back to use the stand it's study and works just fine.
2,The sound is intermittent. Which requires a lot of pausing and unpausing to get the sound to kick back in.
2,Disappointed. The sound quality is muffled and static.
1,The supposedly wired headphones force you to connect with bluetooth and when you do the sound you hear is the same as if a tin can was glued around your ear and someone was playing music from a speaker underwater in a pool. In all seriousness though the product is a knockoff of Apple’s real iPhone headphones and I am aware it was not the singular headphone pair because i tried both nor was it the phone because it is listed in the title as compatible and others also had the problem on the Apple community website. You’re better off buying genuine bluetooth headphones like Airpods if unlike me you don’t easily lose things. If you cant afford Airpods just buy genuine wired headphones not this cheap trash or downgrade your phone to one with a 3.5mm headphone jack so that you can use the same wired headphones you would with a laptop for example.
2,Nothing
1,I never really enjoyed the quality of the sound but I figured hey for the price I’ll deal.  Within the first week the first pair busted where the volume adjustment is.  I figured it was a fluke but no now after using the second set the same has happened to take.  I taped it and now the port to attach it to my phone is also falling apart.  I guess you get what you pay for on this one.
4,This is a nice case for the low price.  There are cut outs in the appropriate spots although I may modify the speaker cut outs of it affects sound quality too soon to tell. A big plus is that there is a Velcro enclosure to hold the kindle in place so you know it is secure. One con is that the corners are all open and vulnerable to a drop but the case does protrude slightly to protect them. In all this is a good value case and well made plus it looks nice when closed.  Not sure how the stand will hold up over time but for now it works well and the magnets work as they should for auto on/off.Edit a couple months later: still holding up great impressed with quality of protection for price. I often have the kindle in the higher of the two recline positions and have only had to readjust the Velcro once. GOOD BUY!
5,This headphone amplifier will ruin your day as it did mine. If you like me have purchased some of Woo’s Voo Doo magic which is not cheap and then you compare it to the Dark Voice it will ruin your day. The value here is the real deal. The quality and sound is every bit as good as WooVooDoo. While you spend a small fortune for Woo's VooDoo sounds the DarkVoice sounds just amazing and is as good maybe better. The quality the point to point wiring the volume control are all excellent. The music is extreemly clear and musical. You can will this amplifer to your kids. This is an amplifier that will last. I rolled a 1950 GE 6AS7 and wow the sound stage is so wide I hear music coming from behind me. It is easy to locate each instrument each vocal and the sound of foot pedals on the piano as the musician presses and releases them. If you own a Woo do yourself a favour and don’t buy this. Damnit...I am still enjoying the amplifier. As of today is 8/14/18 I installed a Western Electric 421A and a Sylvania 7N7. Fantastic!
2,Just bought these last week for work. The third day one pair started to quit. I had to jiggle the wire. Threw  those out and now on the second pair in the first week. Sad.
4,Works well and is a tenth of the cost of the Sony brand (which should have been included with the camera). Seems like it could have been made a little more compact but it plugs directly into the outlet which is great.
4,This package of 80-min. blank CD-Rs with blank white faces for easy writing is a good buy; there is no case or spindle to contain them but I used one from a previous purchase of a different brand.  So far I used about two dozen disks all for music .wav files with only 1 or 2 failures and those because despite the apparent labeling of these discs as "80 min." I have not been able to get them to record past about 79:20 (or 800 Megabytes).  The final track is abruptly shortened if the disk is trying to record more than this but at least my software indicates a failure.  Aside from that limitation this package is a bargain.
3,EDIT**After only about 2 months of only once a week use this chord already has a lot of static and feedback coming through. Making it unusable. I’ll be needing to purchase another one but I may have to shop around for something more durable. It was good while it lasted.I've been using this for my gaming live streams on my Patreon. Plugging the RCA cables to the TV and the XLR into the soundboard. It's been a much better cable over the RCA to 1/4in that I was using previously. Would absolutely buy again if I needed one.
5,Very NICE sound for this price and comfortable.
5,Needed this cable for my new GTX 1660 Super as my pc is older and has only 6pin power connectors coming from the non-modular psu.  The plastic connectors on the ends of the cables were a little hazy/white but I didnt buy it for looks.  Plugged it in and it worked like a charm.  I probably could of got away with one 6 to 8 pin adapter instead of the dual 6 pin because my graphics card only needs 125w.  The PCIe slot provides 75w a 6 pin will supply 75w and a 8 pin will supply 150w.  but my card has an 8 pin connection so I gave it the full 150w of supplemental power.  Good product for a good price.
1,On the positive side when I encountered the problems described below the vendor was extremely responsive and helpful but in the end I still couldn't get it to work. I couldn't have asked for better support.The problem was my video source was a Roku which the Converter would NOT play "nice" with (even though I tried multiple Roku models including the Stick and the Roku Premier). There seems to be an incompatibility in the Converter's support of the HDMI output from the Rokus. The result is intermittent but continual HDCP (Content Protection) errors that pop up every 5-10 minutes. They only last for a few seconds but it is very irritating and always seem to happen just at a critical and exciting moment in every script !!! :-(Unfortunately the Content Protection algorithms don't just happen once but continuously. What seems to be happening is the Converter can't keep up with the continuous streams of CP Check Sums sent by the Roku and misses responding to an occasional burst thus causing a momentary HDCP error which recovers in a second when the next check transmission occurs but during that time there is a full-screen HDCP ERROR message on the TV screen.I think I have found a low cost ($21.99) HDMI to Component Video converter alternative on Amazon that so far has been working properly for a day. Hopefully that success continues over time.
2,These headphones didn't even last two days of light usage before falling apart.
4,Does its job. I looked at many different cases before deciding on this one. My husband bought me the iPad air for my birthday so I at least wanted to protect his pricey purchase. We have a case similar to it on an older iPad and it worked well but this one also had the corner protection that I like. I've dropped it on the bed to see how it would "hold up". I'm too scared to test it on the ground but it did fine of course. The flaps are a little annoying I find myself only using the top one really but it needs a little pulling to put into place. My one suggestion would be maybe some type of opening on the front cover for the camera so if you were to fold it up you could take pictures rather than having to leave the flap all open.
4,I tried other screws/standoffs that claimed to work with MSI motherboards but it seems like MSI has changed their standoff size because this one worked on MSI z170 a pro motherboard but I've seen other reviews saying it didn't work on other MSI boards
5,I don't know if it was a special sale but I got this cover for less than $6. I figured for that price what do I have to lose?I opened the package and was amazed at the quality and detail of this case. It is great.1) It has a velcro fold-over flap that holds the Fire in place. No chance my tablet is going to slip out (like some of the cheap cases that don't have a flap that covers the side where you slide the device in).2) Magnetic on-off strip. This really helps battery life.3) Feels nice and sturdy without weighing twice as much as the tablet. I've had some covers for tablets and e-readers that felt like cardboard...this feels sturdy (so far).4) It has cutouts in all the right places. You can access the charging ports easily...it even has holes for the speakers. They really did a good job designing this for the Fire HD 8.9. This is not a generic case.5) Quality. I've had this case for over a year now and it's still in great shape.I'm very glad I didn't spend $30 or more on another case. This one is great!
5,First of all amazon shows the wrong picture here. This is an electrically powered signal amplifier with an integrated 4 port distribution splitter. I bought this because my over the air signal is weak. I cut the cable a year ago in favor of getting my cable channels over the internet. However most of my "local" over the air channels come in badly. Add to that the fact that my home is in a low spot and I'm lucky I get the few that I do. I replaced a standard 3 way splitter with this little amplifier. I can't say exactly how much of a boost I get but my picture is now clear and the 2 TVs with signal gauges both report signal as good or 100%. For under $40 I consider this an excellent product well worth the purchase.One thing to be aware of: The amplifier is powered over the cable line. The short pigtail cable provided is way too short in many cases. Any standard TV grade cable of whatever length you need can be substituted.
4,I ordered this cable to convert an RCA signal from an Xbox to VGA for my computer monitor. I wasn't sure if the cable would work this way since it wasn't really meant for it but I tried anyway because of the low price. Unfortunately it did not work but when I tried to use it for its intended purpose it failed to work again.I'm not sure if it was the cable or something I was doing wrong but I tried many different things to try to figure out the problem and each time it seemed the VGA to RCA was at fault.After contacting the seller they offered to refund the full price which even though the cable has a very low price shows the quality in their customer service.If anyone knows of a common mistake that I may have made during my trial and error testing then please let me know.
1,If you want a simple wired earbuds without any Bluetooth pairing for traveling no need to worry about battery this product is not the one you want to get. Not sure why it need Bluetooth paired then use wire for charging. The product design is so poor.
2,Not that good
4,I have DirecTV Genie 2 HR17-100  a LG OLED TV and an Anthem receiver/amp. I bought this to integrate my Slingbox HD Pro into my main system where I have an Ethernet switch. My DirecTV system only has HDMI out for video. The box would not allow 4K passthrough- error: Your TV is not 4k. This seems to happen due to failed handshake. The box also changed the sound out from my Anthem to my surround. R and L became Center out and I lost surround. I moved it to a box in my bedroom instead using a line adapter for ethernet and it otherwise works as hoped.
2,The bass and crisp sound digital music is known for us missing in these ear buds.
3,This protector does NOT perfectly fit the Acer Iconia A110. The screen protector is too small to cover the face properly so it's almost useless. The cover fits VERY tightly but will serve its purpose. The stylus that comes with it is very cheaply made and has some sharp edges so when the cheap rubber tip eventually wears out (and I have a feeling it'll wear out VERY soon) you'll end up gouging your screen with it. I haven't tried the headphones yet but they seem really cheap too. The connection cable is very nicely made and works very well. Overall I'd say it'll work fine for what I needed and the rest of the cheap stuff I can just throw away. Just stuff to keep in mind if you are wanting something higher quality. I only needed a protective case to carry my tablet without scratching it all up and that's what I got. It's worth the price if you just want the kit for that reason. if you expect to get high quality components with it you may just be better off looking elsewhere.
4,I have had this headpone amp for a little more than 4 yers now.  So now I can answer questions.SOUNDS REAL GOOD. it's durable ** easy to connect and setup.Sound:  Very smooth and the volume knob is responsive.  Easy to use without really looking.  Small turns make small increases.  Nice!**Durability:  I have mistakenly left this amp on for DAYS at a time.  No problem.  No overheating.  No loss in sound quality.  I have listened for hrs at a time.  Only needed to get to bed.  Otherwise I'd still be listening.Easy to connect and use.  Plug into rear with RCA's and then with single plug to computer.Enjoy
1,Received the items were quickly on time for my wife to use at bedtime.The earplugs were totally failed. It would not connect to Beats Bluetooth.Tried many times it did connect finally but soon after. Tried the second pair same results.My wife was frustrated and not impressed with my decision to purchase these earplugs.What a big disappointment….
1,It has the inconvenience of being paired to your Bluetooth like they are wireless but they plug in. And they won’t play in another phone unless you unpair it. They are not well made either so sound quality was poor as well.
1,So I just needed some cheap headphones for occasional work calls when I am on Zoom calls and having to be out of the house.I tried these as soon as they arrived. The first pair was nothing but static over the sound. Not usable.The 2nd pair sounded great when I turned them on so I thought I was good. But now the second time using them they randomly stop playing sound. I unconnected and connected again and they eventually come back on but then stop playing randomly again. This is no use to me.Also the volume is weird. They won’t turn down enough to have soft sound without turning off the sound completely.Not a good purchase.
5,These are great sounding cables.  Although I consider myself an audiophile I feel most of the recommendations to buy expensive cables is marketing gimmick to get you to spend money on the part of the audio chain with the biggest mark up.  I have found that there is a noticeable improvement in sound on good equipment when going from small gauge to larger gauge wire or cables  but beyond that the law of diminishing returns generally kicks in.  I have listened to a number of  speaker cables and interconnects costing hundreds of dollars and in blind A/B testingg found them to be no better than those that are in the $10-20 price range (although those $10-20 cables usually sound much better than the interconnects that come with audio components or small gauge wire) but these are somewhat of an exception to my observation.  Although they are not expensive cables I find them to sound clearer to similarly priced larger gauge cables that I also own.  These are the cables that I recommend to friends who are buying good equipment.  I use these with my Klipch rf83s and rc 64s
4,Bought in a pinch to help my church start live-streaming services in the wake of the COVID-19 changes.  One or two of them were a little loose and had to be tightened up to keep the picture clean but they work and didn't cost a lot.Can't speak to the longevity yet but I have other cheap adapters that are over a decade old and still work fine.
1,First of all this item is a huge scam. Nowhere does it mentioned Bluetooth it specifically says "WIRED CONNECTION" but no these will only function if you pair them as bluetooth which gives it a good 0.5-1.0 second audio delay which is very noticeable. They also have a mislabel and misspell as to what these are in the settings they are "Baets" I assume they mean "Beats" which these are not. Total bs and they should be reported and delisted from Amazon. DO NOT BUY.
4,Recently upgraded to FIOS One and realized (too late) that I would lose the component connections from my main cable box. I travel quite a bit for work and needed my SLINGPLAYER for sports while traveling abroad. Was glad to see someone came up with a solution that worked. Although a little pricey for what it actually does I can confirm it worked...
1,Los auriculares no conectan bien con el iPhone se escucha estática se desconecta igual se corta la llamada si estás en una. no son buenos en nada esta situación crea mal humor e incomodidad. No son de buena calidad.
4,Product works. Updated a several year old Slingbox 500 to work with the newest HDMI only Verizon - Fios box. Spent 8 + hours troubleshooting. Not as easy as I would have hoped required paid assistance from Slingbox ($30+ per incident) In an effort to speed things along hoping hat I was missing something obvious. They weren’t all that helpful and ended up resolving the issue myself. Finally got it to work with an iPad and a MacBook but a little buggy with a new iMac that’s still problematic.
4,The case does not add much bulk or weight to the Ipad Air. All ports are open and available the pad is held in by velcro making it very secure. It is a bit difficult to take the pad out but since there is no reason to this is not an issue. The cover is held closed by magnets which also turn it on. The materials are quite good for $17.00 and since we are vegetarians the perfect leather for us. The red is a true red and it goes quite well with the white Ipad. The corners are well protected and will survive a small drop. When closed it looks like a thin book on the shelf. Pretty pleased with the purchase. Would have rated a 5 but "love" I will reserve for my wife.
2,As soon as I plugged in 1 pair one side wasn’t working
3,When I ordered the photo was of the Discgear with the leather type finish that looked like an old school guitar amp kind of thing which I thought was pretty cool. The units I received had the right item # on them were textured black plastic. Not unattractive and didn't impact the function but disappointing as these were a gift for my wife as she really wanted the leather looking ones... (and the ones that were on the shelf at our local electronics store were trashed).So far we have had them a couple of weeks and they seem to work as advertized. Their online organizer / print software is a royal pain to use you can muddle through but there are no sort options of any kind and in general seems to be kind of an afterthought. They would have been kinder just setting up an Excel or Word template for users to plug data into.Long story short I don't regret them but I am not enamored by them either...
1,After about 4-5 uses the sound in the left ear went out. When you plug into phone you get a lot of static due to the plug moving around a lot and disconnecting. The volume control is slow and delayed by at least 10 seconds.
4,This is the 2nd case I tried for my iPad Air.  This one feels very solid and protective. The other case I had was much lighter but always felt like it was going to rip when I opened it.  This case is heavier (that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) but it feels like it is better protection for my favorite technology.  I even inadvertently tested it's protective quality by dropping my iPad accidentally onto the tile floor with no harm at all to the iPad.  The old case probably wouldn't have protected the iPad as well.  Because of the nice leather feel and the extra protection I am willing to put up with a couple of extra ounces of weight.
2,They are inconsistent in working with IPhone 13.
4,This unit worked fine. It has menus for selecting scan size/rate of your VGA monitor level settings s-video/video selection and more. It came with the required AC adapter/cable and an s-video cable which I used. It does use a BNC connector for composite video and you may need an adapter to hook up a consumer RCA video cable.
1,This product connects to your iPhone as a Bluetooth headset … sus. Why is this Bluetooth??? I wanted a plugged in headphones that doesn’t need my phone Bluetooth to be onThe minimum volume on my iPhone is already very loud …
5,This case is perfect for the iPad Air. It fits snugly and doesn't look bulky or cheap.  I like the way that it props up in the back--I had a case like this for my iPad 2 and wanted this to do the same thing.  The only think I don't really know the point of is the elastic hand grip.  I have tried to grasp it by this several different ways and it's not really comfortable to use.  It doesn't add any bulk or get in the way though so it's not a big deal.  My husband also ordered a case for his iPad Air and I think he is going to order one of these.  Mine is red and I love it--not too bright to look cheap just right for me!**Update I used this case for two years until my husband got me a new one for Christmas. It still worked well but was just getting dirty and shabby looking. The case my husband got me is falling apart after 8 months of use. I'm ordering another one of these.
1,The ear buds came in but rught off the bat i heard static continuously when the microphone kept messing up no matter who i talked to the person on the receivin end will not be able to hear me
2,I am using a Slingbox 500 with an older Comcast cable box that has the component outputs required for Slingbox. The newer Comcast boxes do not have component outputs. Before replacing my Comcast box I decided to try the HDMI to component converter with my existing Comcast box to see if it would work. The converter has one HDMI input one HDMI output and component outputs. It is powered through a USB port on either the Comcast box or the Slingbox.Once I had the units all hooked up the TV and the Slingbox stream (as viewed on my Ipad) would periodically go blank for a few seconds and then recover. Thinking it might be the interaction between the converter and the Slingbox I disconnected the component cables between the converter and the Slingbox and the periodic blank outs continued. At this point the connection was HDMI from the Comcast box to the converter and HDMI from the converter to the TV. So with the Slingbox out of the picture I have to conclude that the converter is at fault. I will try a different brand of converter to determine if there is any solution at all Comcast's disappointing upgrade.
5,The case looks good and kind-of resembles a leather notebook. The grayish-beige on the inside is OK and the product seems generally sturdy. The contact point where the case folds into itself (allowing it to stand up straight) is high up enough so that the tablet won't topple over.The only thing I don't like about it that while you'd expect it to open like a book (opening the cover from right to left and then having the tablet on the right side) it does not (it opens left-to-right like opening a book starting from the last page).Unfortunately it is impossible for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 to have a fold-under case that opens from left-to-right due to the positioning of the camera on the left (since the fold has to be opposite to the camera in order for the camera to be on top when it's sitting on a desk).This is a minor nuisance that only really is relevant when peeking at the device with some regularity as you would normally fold the case under the tablet when using it more extensively.
4,Product works as advertised but unfortunately sling box no longer provides support (unless you pay $30).  Bought the product because my cable company installed new boxes.  The new boxes are not compatible with sling box.  Called sling box and was told good luck. Tried for hours to get it to work to no avail. Therefore I wasted my money on your product.
1,There’s a loud static noise when both headphones are plugged in. The audio levels are all over the place and the sound that comes out is extremely tinny. No bass at all. Save yourself the headache and spend the extra 8 dollars to get one pair of apple headphones that work versus being stuck with two sets that sound like the first telephone.
1,This have to be connected to Bluetooth and plugged into your phone at the same time. Why. Randomly disconnect causing my phone to play out loud at my office. Left speaker also broke within 2 weeks
1,The first time I used them I could barely hear. There was static and it would cut in and out. After that first time I can't the audio to work.
2,I purchased this box to support BNC to VGA for a security camera system (video camera is BNC) through a DVR.  The monitor uses a VGA input which should have easily handled the project.  I started by not using the DVR box but connected directly from a powered BNC connector video camera to the display monitor VGA connector using this adapter box.  What I find is that the setup of the box using the provided buttons is frustrating in the least and maddening at the most.  The boxes in setup mode will not support (using the designated buttons) a move to structure other features.  Also pressing mode a second time under the menu moves the instructions to Chinese.  After fooling around with this issue for about one (1) hour  I gave up.  There were no instructions which did not help and the existing on display functions did not work.  As such I was unable to get this adapter to work.  While it is a handy and cost effective "S" video BNC and VGA adapter it is just junk if you cannot interact with it to get it to work.
4,Among the best value for iPad cases does the job well for the price. The case comes with an additional Apple Pencil holder so no need to get a separate one.A couple of minor issues none of which were deal breakers but I wanted to point them out nonetheless:(1) The case covers the side edges of the iPad making it harder to swipe up/down from the edges. I often have to peel back the case a bit just to swipe on the edges.(2) You can't keep the case open without leaving the magnetic pencil holder on it.(3) The camera cutouts are slightly misaligned.
1,Too much static.  Lowest possible volume was too loud. And too much background noise.  I let my English bulldog puppy chew them up as she is want to do with everything that belongs to me.
1,Why have Bluetooth headphones that still needs to be plugged into your phone to use im so confused why have a wired connection the pics showed both a wired and also wireless device so I thought this one was just wired!! Very stupid design
1,These are not durable. The earbuds come apart and are difficult to put back together. Now only 1 earbud works. I should have returned them. These are cheaply made.
1,When they are connected they work fine. They only stay connected less than 5 minutes and then a high pitched squeal is piercing your eardrums.  Would not recommend these at all!
5,We upgraded to FIOS TV One and the new set top boxes did not have component outputs. Therefore something was needed to make my Slingbox connect via the component input..  I ordered this converter from Amazon and setup was easy. I connected the HDMI output from the set top box to the converter HDMI input. The HDMI output on the converter connected to the HDMI input  on the TV and the component output on the converter connected to the component input on the Slingbox. Everything works once again. This was the perfect solution. Please be advised that you have to supply your own component cable. The converter comes with one HDMI cable and a USB cable to power the converter. Fortunately my set top box had a powered USB port so this worked out. It's nice to find an easy solution when a problem arises.
5,First of all the price was Amazing!(Amazonamazing???) $4.00 shipped pinch yourself am I awake? inexpensive but the real kicker was the test I inadvertently put it and my Kindle HD through. It was a rush morning and I took off with my Kindle in case on top of my van. While getting on the highway at about 50 mph I heard it bounce across my roof and knew immediately what had happened. I turned around worked my way back to the entrance ramp and there it was...case open and face down on the pavement. The case got some scrapes but my Kindle and case were intact and working! There is one thing that is a drawback. As shown in the picture you can make a stand out of the case but only in the horizontal position. I prefer reading in the vertical position. You can stand it up that way but it's straight up and down and I prefer the kindle to be on a slight angle. Even with that I give it 5 stars for price and great protection!
4,I was looking to try out a real tube amp not a hybrid. After tons of forum threads and research I decided to grab a darkvoice dispute some of the shortcomings I had read about. First the unit looks and sounds fantastic with my 650s. I had no issues with the build quality and the stock tubes are not as bad as I was expecting.
5,Received a new cable box from comcast and my previous setup for splitting the signal to my slingbox stopped working.  I was hesitant to purchase this unit because of the price but it was the only one that looked like the real deal and combined HDMI thru while splitting the signal out to component cables for my slingbox 350.  It is plug and play. Just connect all your signal sources properly and this will have you up and slinging again in no time. It is expensive but you get what you pay for. I was afraid of going with cheaper options only to have them not work. If you are looking at this item for a slingbox with component inputs then this is the one that you want.
5,This case is excellent. It is so lightweight that I don't feel any weight at all was added to my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It is a very important feature to me. The case is sturdy and protects my Kindle well. I have no idea what kind of protection it would offer in case of fall but it is all I need to protect my Kindle inside my backpack or purse. Besides the way the case was devised it can stand in any circunstance. It is not the kind of case that can slip because of the little "buckle" that holds the cover folded (I don't know how to call that little thing behind the case into which you slip the edge of the cover but you can see it in the pictures furnished by the seller). One more thing: I bought two cases and neither of them smelled of chemicals or plastic or whatever. I know some people had this kind of problem with other brands of cases. I recommend it to anybody interested in a good quality case.
1,The sound was good on them but just a few days in the sound went out on the right side then a day or so later the ear piece came a part. I had used them probably 5 times so not a lot of wear and tear
5,I've been listening close to three hours now huge changes from the first 10 minutes.  Night and Day differences.  Beautiful Sweet Sounds from Tubes.Let the Tubes Warm Up this isn't a Solid State Amp.  This is old school baby.Let the unit settle.  Don't get discouraged!  Yes it will sound like crap!  You'll heard distortion buzzing and the left channel may buzz!  This is only for a short period of time.  Third hour in and it's all gone.I'm incredibly happy with my purchase and the sound that I'm hearing from the DarkVoice 336seUpdate:  Sep 01 2020I absolutely love this headphone amp.  Find the right Vacuum Tube Combination and you'll enjoy every note.Almost Two Years of daily use and not one issue to report.
5,Work perfectly with my iphone.
5,I bought thr red & glad I did! I can spy it when  I think I've lost it. It's a lot like one I had for previous iPad but not nearly as heavy. That's why I purchased the 'air' ( less weight) so why would I lean toward  a heavier cover. So you give up the luxury of heavy leather when purchasing this cover. BUT there are some pluses: rounded corners that make a nice edge ( thoughtful addition) flap curls in to nicely hold iPad in place the ability to use the incorporated stand ( in 2 positions)  on the back.Nicely made all I've given up on is the weight. When I fold back the cover to hold iPad in one hand and then decide to close it up it's difficult to find the back piece to fold back over the top. And I think it has to do with the magnet at the top needed to securely close. The iPad. That's my only critism.
5,This is a great solution if you have tried to connect your slingbox using only HDMI cables only to find that when you connect using slingbox remotely the picture of your TV and the slingbox signal turns off and on due to HDCP issues. I found that using only component (don't be scared by the item description that is mispelled "Compornent") from this box to the Slingbox and then from Slingbox to your TV results in a inferior signal. Best to use a HDMI from this box to your TV and use the component cables from this adapter box to the Slingbox and then using the component connection from Slingbox to the TV only as a way to view the setup of your Slingbox. That said it's pretty lame that Slingbox doesn't have this built into their box to begin with.
4,This will work fine for you if you do it right.  I used it to protect 2 screen devices that are not Apple devices (their business practices offend me particularly their exploitation of slave labor. Yes this product was probably made in China too but my protest starts with the #1 manufacturer/offender in the world). The only instructions were on the little tabs on the top and bottom of the protector. If you slide it out of the plastic protecting the protector then remove the next layer of protection via the 2 tabs then lay it down slowly from one end to the other any bubbles you end up with will be insignificant (you can press most of them out as you lay it down).
4,No it's not perfect but at the price point all I wanted was something that would do a good job protecting my Kindle Fire.  It's actually better than I expected (based on the price) and contra some of the other reviewers here I have no problem getting to the switches or the charging ports.  And I hardly ever use the 'stand' feature but the times that I have it's worked just fine.  Perhaps with a lot of wear the little flap might start giving way but for now it's perfectly workable.Highly recommended!(And now I see they've reduced the price even more?  Go ahead and micro-splurge it's even more worth the try now.)
2,I recently purchased this for my panasonic TH-42PD50U plasma.  The horizontal hole spacing on my TV is 26".  Here is the problem... the max TV horizontal hole spacing for this mount is in fact 24".  The description on amazon shows this correctly in one place and wrong in another.  Under specifications it correctly says that the max TV hole spacing is 610mm x 405mm (610mm = 24")  Though if you continue to read the next section labeled important it INCORRECTLY states that the max TV hole spacing is 725mm x 480mm (725mm = 28.5").  The only reason that I believed the second would be true is that the first picture of the mount backs that data up.  It shows that the horizontal width of the unit is 30.7".  IT IS NOT!!!  I just measured it and it is only 26".  Maybe it was at one time but the one that I received is not everything else looks identical except for this.Item will be returned.  Hopefully amazon can correct the description to prevent your possible disappointment.Amazon to do list:1.  Change first picture dimensions horizontal from 30.7" to 26".2.  Delete erroneous information under important description section: (725mm x 480mm)Good luck.
5,I changed battery very easy. Save big money.
1,I purchased two packs because my dogs chewed all 3 pairs of my earbud pros and I got tired of spending so much. These DO NOT WORK AT ALL- and I mean at all. You plug them in and nothing. I tried all 4 pairs and none work. Cannot hear anything at all or speak through the microphone. This was a joke.
5,Well this has to be the best deal on amazon I have ever purchased these flat panel wall mounts are always so ridiculously expensive everywhere especially your local best buy which is always a rip off. Im pretty sure you wont find a cheaper unit that's not to say the unit itself is cheap ITS NOT. In fact if I ever get anymore TV's I will buy this mount again and recommend it to friends and family. I read some other reviews on here about there not being room in the back once the tv is on this is not true. There is plenty of room and if there was anymore the panel would stick out TOO much and just look silly. The build is great sturdy and the lock mechanism does the job as does the pivot. Side note I used my own screws to mount the bracket to the wall because usually hardware included is cheap and well I just don't trust it. This was for a 46" Samsung.
4,How's this thing work? What'd the rest of you do to get your iPad into it? There's no "stretch" to it and it seems to me it'll rip or warp the more I wrestle with it to get the tablet inside.Never mind. I'm an idiot. I discovered there's a Velcro strap on the inside that you pull out & to the left and then the tablet slides right in. Derp. Thanks to whoever gave the answer in the questions section...which I should have checked first.
5,The item arrived on time nicely packaged. You will need a component RCA (male - male) cable(s) to connect the adapter to the Slingbox component-input from the adapter's "Component" output. Depending on your setup you might also need an HDMI cable to connect the adapter to your HDTV which will mirror what is playing on Slingbox on that HDTV. Chances are that if you got a new STB without component output this will get your Slingbox working without too much effort (using components as your source) as it was before. Most would probably agree that this is a bit pricey for what it. Also please note that this will only work up to 1080p. If you can get it to output 4K let me know ;P)Overall I am pleased with this product. Hope it works for you as well.
1,For some reason these headphones were trying to connect to my devices via Bluetooth. One of them was disfunctional and kept turning down my volume whenever it was plugged in. I was very disappointed.
1,They are broken already the sound quality is not good on calls they tell me I sound far away. I should’ve got a refund.
5,I am starting a podcast. My mixer has RCA output. My recorder has XLR input. I went to Best Buy Micro Center and Guitar Center. None of them had what I was looking for so I went on Google. It directed me to Amazon and I had it within 48 hours. Works exactly as I'd hoped!!!
1,This product was no good it broke less than week. A lot of static then it just go clear no sound. Had many issues with them I end up in the garbagez
5,Comcast/Xfinity installed a Pace/Samsung XG2 cable box at my in-laws and it only has the red/yellow/white component outputs.  This only allowed my Slingbox 500 to output SD quality video.Physical installation was VERY easy and all I had to do afterwards was reconfigure the Slingbox 500 via the website.  As a Comcast user in Houston TX the reconfiguration was easy but your mileage will very based on your cable company.I accidentally found this item on Amazon and decided that it was worth purchasing.  I also bought the 5 color composite cables as this item only came with an HDMI cable and a micro-usb power cord.  This one-time added purchase was worth it to me when you consider the cost of the monthly subscriptions for Hulu Live YouTube TV etc.
5,Used this battery with an Animal DC44.  Fit is perfect and used it for over 30 minutes each time.  I'm not sure how long the charge lasts but it's great not to run out of charge during routine cleaning.  I usually connect the charger to the vacuum cleaner after each use.  I don't use the wall caddie so the larger battery housing is not a problem for me.
1,My Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 was over 4 years old and the original battery would only hold a charge for 1 or 2 hours. I ordered a replacement from this company. It wasn't too hard to install. The old battery was easy to remove. The new one installed easy too. Then the bad news... It would not charge. It would go into a loop. First the charge symbol then it would boot up. It then would immediately return to the charge symbol. I tried everything suggested. It finally booted up and I could use it as long as it was on the charger. It had no battery power though. I decided to remove it and send it back for a replacement. When I tried to gently disconnect the battery connector as I did with the original battery the new battery's connector pulled the connector off of the motherboard!! It damaged my Tab 4 and now I cannot use it. The seller offered a refund of the battery's price but nothing for the Tab 4 that broke due to the connector on the battery seizing the motherboard connector so tight it broke when it was removed. That is the status right now. I worked in the electronics industry for nearly 4 decades before I retired. I have worked on hundreds if not thousands of devices over the years.
4,These things must cost a nickle to make because I would think it cost the seller more than what I paid just to ship it from China to the U.S.. However the adapter appears to be built of durable materials.I have a ZMODO video surveillance system and I contacted them to see if the DVR's video card supported TV out and if this adapter would work. Their response was "yes". They even tried selling me a pricier adapter on their website.Well this adapter didn't work so I'll most likely be re-listing it on Amazon so it doesn't go to waste. I wen't with a male BNC to female RCA adapter $4.99 @ select RS stores.
5,Like it a lot. The only thing we had a issue with is the hand strap. It seemed to not to be in the right place to make it usable for our size of hand. Originally I thought it was a feature I was going to use a lot but now that I have the case I don't have a need for it as the stand is what I use the most which is great. I don't know if a larger hand would fit better or not. It is constructed well so it should. I also noticed several reviews that said this had a strong smell. Mine did not and to sense any smell you have to put your nose right down on it and then it is mild at best. The red on is a very nice color. I'm glad I purchased this case and would buy another one without hesitation.
5,I have a 4K set top box and had to use a HDMI splitter to have my Sling-box work.With this unit it's HDMI in and out and  acts as the splitter also gives the HDMI to component adapter for the slingbox. Can only get 1080i trough it but  that's fine as there is very little 4K broadcasting and my 4K Blu-ray player hooks up a different route.The HDMI cable they send with it is only 18" long and couldn't see why they would send something that short. It was perfect in my setup and saved me a trip to Bestbuy or Staples and the added expense.If you use a slingbox this adapter is well worth the added cost.
5,My new cable box only has HDMI but my Slingbox doesn't.  So the choice is this or buy a splitter and converter and hope they play well together.  Plus buying 2 of those would take 2 power sources since they usually take a mini usb 5v power input.This works well.  The signal feeds to both the HDMI and Slingbox at the same time.  There won't be many times when that would happen.  But the important thing is the feed doesn't have to be switched. It goes to both when the cable box is on and this box is powered.
1,Well I finally got the bug to crawl into the attic and install this 40ft HDMI cable not a fun thing to do on a hot Texas day.  Anyway hoping the best for all my trouble I turned on the TV and the cable box and stereo.  Much to my dismay as I began to flip through channels everytime I came to a HD channel a quick message would pop up on my TV saying "HDCP unable to establish link" or something similar to and and then the TV would shut off and then restart.  After it powered back on the TV would display the channel.  But far from the quality I would expect from HD over HDMI.So I decided to try my BlueRay player.  I put in a movie and turned the receiver to DVD/BD and more to my dismay all I got was Audio.  The TV was blank except for the No Signal box floating around the screen.I do not recommend this product at all.  I am currently looking into an HDMI balun to send the signal over Cat6 cable which a friend of mine has used in his house and he has been very satisfied.I am not sure if this cable is defective or just not up to par.  I mat check first with customer service to see about an exchange.
5,Plug and play works great with my Sling box M2 and Spectrum Cable. I switched from DIshnetwork to Spectrum cable and believed I would not be able to use the slingbox again. The only thing you need to do is reconfigure your Slingbox when you open the PC Slingbox App. On line search showed that the Spectrum cable box is made by Technicolor so I just tried the different remotes Slingbox had listed until I found one that worked. Playing around with the settings I found that my new Spectrum box had a remote URC1160 So I found something close in the settings it was a Roger URC xxx ( don't remember the numbers) and it worked great.  So either Tecnicolor or the Roger URC works.
4,The cables are nice however I have had them fail at live performances the wires pull out on the speakon end.The manufacturer should solder the connection this would prevent this issue from occurringUpdate after posting this review I was contacted by the mfg.They are going to start soldering the connectionsThe customer service is excellent
3,It's basically the most over priced screw you can imagine ever buying.  Didn't want to buy it but nobody local has (or even knows) what this item is trying to get a manufacturer replacement would take weeks/months... so what can you do but pay the price and move on?Item was shipped decently fast arrived as described and what I needed.  My ass and wallet are still sore from getting bent over on the price though. At my time of purchase this thing was $14... so yeah.
4,The case looks nice.  I don't know what people are talking about that it is designed "upside down." It's not.  The camera is at the top and the apps all show up in an appropriate direction.  There is a hole for all of the buttons and the charger.  You cannot have the kindle sitting in a landscape position while it is charging unless you set it on a table edge but that's really a Kindle design issue not the fault of the case.  The magnet on/off button works great.  It would be 5 stars if the angle were adjustable in the propped up position.
1,This product is garbage. At the lowest volume level it’s too loud. Plus it connects via Bluetooth despite being wired into the phone.
4,This case fits my IPad Air just fine and at a much better price than cases offered at the Apple Store. I am satisfied with it but would have given it five stars if the lower corners were protected in some way. I realize the bottom of the case needs to be open to allow the iPad to slip in easily but all four corners are not really fully protected; the lower right and left corners are exposed.  Nevertheless is was a good selection after searching for a protective case.
1,One pair I can hear out of the other pair nothing… I contacted the seller and they said they would replace them….3 weeks later….nothing…keep shopping.
5,After the news that JVC/Taiyo Yuden would no longer be making CD-R discs I remembered hearing about MAM-A media. I've used a few of their gold discs for more important projects and I believe Mobile Fidelity uses the same gold discs with for their Ultra Disc audiophile CDs. So far I haven't cooked a coaster yet with these and they seem to be reliable enough. The glossy white finish is attractive enough. So yeah these have been working pretty good for me. The only other alternative I'd recommend are the Verbatim CD-Rs. Not sure how the CMC Taiyo Yuden knockoffs are going to be but so far these have been a decent alternative for us that are picky about their media.
1,These are junk returning tomorrow. Won’t connect to my iPhone with Bluetooth. Out of maybe 30 tries got it to connect one time and when I finally got a connection they sounded like they were underwater. Now back to no connection again even tho they are in my Bluetooth “menu” whatever you want to call it. Keeps saying to make sure they are close enough to connect the earbuds are literally laying on the screen of the phone.. Terrible product save your money.
5,I'm having a hard time hearing my uv-5r ham walkie-talkie radio in a semi tractor. This little wire just solve my problem. I plug one in into the walkie-talkie and the other end into the vehicle stereo. 😀 Just like magic and now I can hear everything on my walkie-talkie over the vehicle radio 👍👍👍👍👍
5,I received an iPad Air as a Christmas gift. A friend gave me a beautiful leather cover she had purchased and not used for hers. Pretty to look at but it didn't protect my iPad very well it fell out on more than one occasion. I did some research on Amazon and picked this cover as being more protective as well as more functional. I've been using it for several weeks now and am VERY pleased with my purchase. Not only does it hold my iPad securely and protect the corners it also provides several different options for positioning. I particularly love the magnetic closure that works when the case is open or closed and prompts the iPad itself to turn on or off without me having to fumble for the button. At this price I will probably buy this again in other colors just to have a spare or two on hand.
1,One pair of the headphones are faulty and causes lots of static. Makes it hard to use. I like to record and unfortunately I am only able to use one pair. Let’s see how long that* pair lasts.
4,I don't have much to say about this review because the cable definitely does its job and it does it well. The price is really low considering that it's a 25 FT cable and you aren't going to find a better competitor for this price. If you want something "better" you can always go for a more expensive brand of these cables but for me this one works great. It does the same as a "brand" cable and gives great sound when connected to my speakers and there was no loss of quality audio. I rate this product 4 stars out of 5 stars!I hope this review helped you out!
5,I was unable to access my Slingbox from outside my home (that's the whole reason for the SB in the first place right?) because the TV had to be physically turned on in order for the Frontier box to output the video signal.  This SOLVED that problem.  Plug it in and you're all set.  The only thing better would be if SB sent this with the product automatically as another $80 on top to make it work is a bit hard to swallow but to make it work as it was intended is worth it.  I now no longer have to cringe when going to the inlaws (without ESPN or even cable for that matter) for holidays during football season.
1,This is the second sour that I’ve ordered. This first time the stopped working after 1 month. The second pair on ear bud on the left stopped working after almost 2 months.
1,The price was good and this came in a two-pack. One of the pairs the right channel doesn't work at all the other pair the volume control / pause / unpause controller doesn't work. You get what you pay for.
1,I plugged these into my phone. There is a tone through the ear buds that indicate they have been plugged in. When I turn on the music the sound comes from the phone speakers. I tried both pairs multiple times. No music comes through the ear buds. They simply are not a functional item.
4,Its nice and its what I was hoping for the color is great and its soft and offers some protection.However I feel like the fit is off because there is some parts where it seems to bow along the sides. and I feel like the top part isn't fitted right because it trips my light sensor. I don't really use the magnetic pen holder having two pens and have a holder already that is a bit more secure in my pencil bag.
1,The first pair started making constant high pitched screeching sounds on day 2. The second pair stopped working after only 8 uses. Total waste of money these are going in the trash. Seeing as how a number of other reviewers had the same problem I think it’s safe to say that these headphones are consistently made poorly and not to last.
1,When plugged into an iPhone they act as if they are Bluetooth and ask you if you want to connect then if using the microphone or even just the headphones you will get a terrible lag. The mouth of the person on your phone screen will not line up with the audio you’re hearing.
4,The CaseCrown Bold Standby case works well for the Fire HD 8.9. The Fire fits snuggly and the magnetic closing catch works well. The fact that it provides the automatic on/off feature when you open and close the case is impressive for an item that sells for around $15. The material while not leather looks like good quality. It supports the Fire nicely at either a steep or a shallow angle in the landscape orientation but can only be stood up at 90 degrees in the portrait orientation which is not a comfortable viewing angle and is not very stable. Overall this case is excellent for the price.
3,Before purchasing this tv mount I did a lot of research.  This mount listed all models of tvs that it was compatable with.  My JVC tv was listed as being compatable with this wall mount.  When I received it there were no instructions and the bolts included with the mount did not fit my tv.  I had to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase the bolts in order to hang the tv.  Obviously little research was done to make sure that the proper hardware was included for the model of tv's listed.  The mount seems fine now and my tv is up.  Just make sure you have everything before starting to hang the tv.
3,I think this product is just okay.  Yes the pictures and the actual product are accurate but I just done like it for these reasons.  The latch on the back so the I cad can stay latched works okay thought it would be better.  The strap wher you put your hand is - is big and your wrist has to stay flat and its just not an ideal way to hold it and the cover dosent say tied down int he back so it shifts in your hand cover to cover and from strap just being large and I alredy have big hands as it is.  As far as protecting the ipad I like it.
5,The only question I had was the power.  There isn't a power supply with the unit in the box just a USB type A connector that has a micro-USB plug for the device.  Luckily I didn't have to make a trip to purchase a wall power supply the SB 500 has a powered USB A connected included on the box.  Sweet.  HDMI pass-through works great.  Component output to the SB works great.  Just tested it with the college bowl games on my laptop.  Works like a champ.  Nice work completely satisfied.
5,Needed the newer plug for a new Nvidia video card and this did the job perfect.  Just make sure you get the plugs all 3 pushed in all the way.  I had a problem where the video card would black out once in a wile and turns out it was the power on the video card side and when making sure it was in good problem went away.  So cord works perfect.
1,music wouldn’t play on one side and they broke extremely easily. wouldn’t buy again
1,I work in construction and go through headphones like crazy (paint overspray and drywall dust) and these 2 didn't last a week. Both times my phone fell from my hand while they were attached and the metal plug completely ripped off of the cord. I had my previous pair of Apple headphones for over a year and they survived drops all the time. Even for the price these are extremely fragile and worthless honestly.
4,This is a substantial case and I really like it.  The reason for 4 vs 5 stars is that to slide open the control center at the bottom of the screen is a bit tricky to do as the case covers a bit of the bottom of the screen. I have figured out a method that works for me but my husband who has larger fingers has trouble with it most of the  time.  However I would buy this case gain.
5,Very good quality materials and engineering for the price. I have recommended this to other users and they feel the same. My iPad is well protected from drops and bumps and stays clean. The cover is easy to flip around and the magnetic closure works like a charm with my iPad Air.The slots in the back work fairly well to prop up the iPad although they are quite stiff at the beginning. The cover when folded back and slipped into the slots isn't as secure as I'd like and has come out often. I wouldn't use this feature all the time.A good-looking cover that protects my investment.UPDATE September 2016: This has been a terrific case that has been used daily at home traveled a few times and held up extremely well. Definitely highly recommended.
3,it works fine at 1080i with 5.1 channel digital surround sound but not with 1080p and 5.1 digital surround sound.  Construction is solid but the thickness of the cable is a little thicker than a cat5 cable a lot thinner than other HDMI cables.  This might lead to some interference...but haven't had any yet.  if you want 1080p and digital sound this cable will NOT work for you.  if you're fine with 1080i and digital sound this cable's fine.  with that said it'll work with cable boxes as their signals are 1080i but for blu-ray players xbox 360 or ps3 you can only play those devices in 1080i.
5,Excellent quality! We are using all 16 connections and have this hooked up to a RCA 70 mile range Yogi HD antenna.  Great quality on every connection (i tested them all) in the house and we are not using any type of signal booster.  I stuck with extreme brand because our last home was built new 5 years ago and that's what the builder used (only had an 8 way splitter there) so when when we moved and needed more connections I hopped this would do a good job and it did!
5,Recently upgraded my FIOS with a new set top box; had to figure out way to continue to use Slingbox 500 with good pix quality (didn't like quality of the composite signal). New set top box did not have component output only HDMI.  This adapter worked out perfect.  A little pricey at $80 but works great.  Took HDMI from set top box to the adapter then component and HDMI outputs from adapter to Slingbox and finally HDMI output from Slingbox to TV.  No problems great pix.
3,No instructions included. No direction to instructions. A couple comments mentioned a YouTube video which I found by searching. Got the unit apart and the battery in but broke the back around the on/off switch. Now I need a pin to turn it on and off. Battery life is much better. I wouldn't recommend this for a first time installer. Maybe OK with some experience.
1,Plugged them into my phone and no sound through the headphones sound comes out of speakers only.
5,As a new PS3 160gb owner - I was faced with a 50/60/70/100 dollar HDMI cable choice from the store where I purchased it and other big box stores where the sales people knew less than I did. One very honest and smart guy told me to save my money and buy one from Amazon. So I did... As a backup I purchased the more expensive one as a comparison on my 56" JVC HD-ILA (JVCs DLP projector 720P) and found absolutely no difference on screen with either Blue-Ray disk or Game play ... and returned the $100 one the next day...I cannot speak of 1080i or 1080p HD sets - but after tax a $100 spread is something worth considering. The PS3 is picky sending signals out to a monitor or TV - but this works as advertised ... and my wallet is all the better for it.
4,The choices for the Acer A100 are limited I was skeptical but decided to give this a try. I was primarily looking for a case and screen protector hoping for protection when the Acer got dropped on a hard surface. While I don't believe this is "real" leather I was surprised the quality doesn't feel cheap. The fit for both the screen protector and the case is exact with all the correct cutouts. The case has magnetic corners that help keep the cover closed and a hidden velcro wrap around flap under the Acer that keeps it tight and secure. The extra pieces are a nice bonus.
1,I bought for a trip because I didn’t  want to lose my good  ones. They worked for only a week.
1,One came broken apart. And the other came all scratched up. I’m so disappointed
5,This is a really great case! Nice color red this was easy to install. It comes in handy when I want to go hands free. The material is not ragged it feels really nice and smooth. There are lots of different options on how you can use it whether you want to hold it or stand up alone and I like the versatility with that. I also like that when I open the case it automatically wakes up my iPad and when I close the case it puts it to sleep so that it is not using battery. When I am continuously using my iPad I do not feel any heat from the iPad not even while charging. The cut out slots are the perfect size for charging and if I wanted to use headphones.
5,I had originally done my current build with a mechanical hard drive and lost the screw that came with the motherboard.  I probably tossed it in with the rest of the random screws and pieces I accumulated over the years.  I searched for it once I decided to upgrade to SSD but couldn't find it.  This product saved the day!
4,I was able to talk my Dad through the hookup over face time. He's 83 & not technical at all so with my help we got it installed along with the Slingbox 500. It was a challenge but once we got everything installed we haven't had any hiccups to date and it does what is advertised. Picture quality is very good.
4,This is protecting my Kindle Fire quite well. It's sturdy when propping up as a stand. The only thing I don't like it the way the openings are for the charging slot. If it were on the other side of the product then I could prop it up and be able to charge the Fire at the same time.
1,You have to connect them to blue tooth to use and there corded!!  A waist of time and money.
5,Works perfectly with my SlingBox 350.  It’s connected to a Spectrim 201-H cable box.  I’ll spell it out for those who may need it.  HDMI out from cable box into this adapter >> Component cables out from adapter into SlingBox >> Component cables out from SlingBox to TV.  At first it didn’t work... I only had sound.  Turns out I didn’t push the component cables all the way in on the SlingBox.  So check your cable connection.One more thing.  The adapter is powered by a USB cable that they provide.  I plugged that into one of our extra iPhone USB chargers and it works perfectly.
1,This product do not work at all I received it just like that. I want my money back and you guys can have your products back. Do not waste your time buying this at all it’s worthless
1,These are honestly really bad headphones. Like even for what they cost they are very low quality
4,I have been looking for reasonably priced case for a while. I was not going to spend $50+ on a case by Amazon. Based on the price I kept my expectation low but to my surprize the case is pretty good with of course some limitations.Pros:- Decent looking- Light weight- Fits wellCons:- Keeping the Kindle in a standing position is a challenge. I guess the material used for the "base" is too soft and wont hold on.Overall I can't complaint for this price and would recommend to budget buyers.
5,Got for my Slingbox. This allows the Composite connection for Sling and an HDMI pass through from the xfinity box to my TV. It works perfectly straight out of the box. Worth every cent. Tried using HDMI splitter and HDMI to composite adapter. Never worked properly. This is the fix if you wish to use tv and Sling at the same time.
1,I don’t know who wrote those reviews like “the sound is amazing”. The sound is soooo bad you guys didn't have headphones with good sound.After a couple weeks of using it it’s buggy one earpiece does not work.Very very cheaply made and so bad.
5,I'm super excited there I am getting lost in the thrill of the build and I reach in the ASUS X470-F Motherboard box and no M.2 Screw kit.  It's totally great.  I jump on Amazon right away and find this kit.  I give it five (5) stars because it worked exactly as advertised.  Yes the price is high but you can't blame GutsParker for being American and practicing free market capitalism.  Now every time I order a couple of pints of beer I can think what else could I have bought and the first thing that will come to mind is... a GutsParker M.2 Standoff screw kit.
3,I should've read the reviews first. Bought this for an Acer Aspire E15 E5-575 laptop that's a couple of years old and the standoff did not fit. It was too loose. I used one of the screws from the back panel to hold the m.2 drive in place.It's quite expensive for what it is but bonus point for next day delivery I guess.
2,Both the emachine and the dell support "TV OUT" from the vga port - however neither manufacture could tell me how to get this cable to work.  Others are saying this worked for them - but if you are using an emachine or a Dell Latitude E6400 - its not going to work - despite the assertion from the vendors that the computers/laptops support TV Out from vga...Don't cheap out - you will have to buy a convert - which I ended up doing.  Even with a converter - the signal is hazy - for video its not unbearable but reading text is impossible.  My emachine has hdmi out - but my HD TV is over 5 years old and does not have HDMI in - I tried this cable and several others - and I currently have the PC2TV converter that converts the vga out to S-video and RCA - both are hazy... in the end the truth is its time for a new TV...
1,i got these specifically because i was tired of commecting bluetooth all the time. these are wired and yet they dont work without connecting to bluetooth. lame
1,I’ve seen so many reviews saying these earbuds were great quality. When they arrived they felt cheap and when I tested them the sound quality was horrible. Reminded me when I had to borrow earbuds from the library at school.
5,I bought this for my wife's Acer ICONIA TAB A110 and the case fits perfectly. My wife won't be using the headset nor the cable as she will be only using it when she has to pick up our granddaughter from school and this will help to pass the time away as she plays her games on it.  But who knows maybe someday she will want to use the cable to hook up to her laptop.  Sadly the screen protector isn't very easy to put on and no matter what I couldn't get all of the air-bubbles out. It is over-sized which makes it easy to remove and being inside the pouch it doesn't matter. Unless you can put it on with no bubbles I would recommend not to cut it to the screen size.  Overall a good buy.  +JMJ+
1,If I could give a zero review I would. Both earphones sound quality is trash. It has a non stop static noise. It’s a complete waste of money
1,Bought two of these both DOA. Tried connecting a few different devices and got either an erratic flickering display or no display at all. Replaced with a known-working HDMI cable and everything's fine. Also this is actually exactly the same item as this... [...] and the product photos don't really match what I received.I was able to get a refund without having to ship the cable back so I figured before I purchased another one I'd try shortening the cable (thinking maybe it's too long for the signal to carry through strongly). After cutting the cable I found that each cable segment inside was just a single copper strand. I'd never tried splicing an HDMI cable before so I don't know if this is common or not but it seems a little crazy to me. Every cable I've ever worked with before has always had at least a few strands of wire for each segment.Don't get me wrong cables are usually way overpriced and I always do my best to get 'em on the cheap... but well... this cable just doesn't work! I'm going to give this one a try now: [...] which is even cheaper after shipping has thousands of good reviews and the customer photos actually match the product photos. Wish me luck!
5,This is second CaseCrown case that I have purchased for my iPad. The first one held up beautifully considering how many times I have dropped my iPad and it had has landed in so many different ways and stayed protected by the case.  I fall asleep reading and drop it often.  The only reason I got a second case was to get a new color and the corners were starting to show a little wear from my abusive care.  I have had more expensive cases that didn't hold up as well.  Also I like being able to prop it up when necessary for convenience.  (I also love the CaseCrown iPhone case - in several colors!)
5,This device uses 5 v of power the same problem happened to me I solved the problem by plugging this device into a constant power source because i set it up by plugging the USB into my television so when i turn off my TV the TV  turns off the power to USB  so when i use sling box  it had audio but no video so when i plugged the device into the wall outlet (with a 5 v Charger of course) then it started to work  just make sure the 4 lights on the device are always on that means you have power
4,Mounted a 42" plasma TV. works fine. Not fancy but provides basic up/down tilt. It puts the TV close to the wall so depending on your TV's connection layout it may be hard to add/remove cables later. Plan ahead!One thing you need to add is some Nylon zip-ties to secure your cables also take the stress off of the TV's connectors. don't let the cables all hang-free under gravity it is pulling on the TV's connectors not healthy for it.Support your cables (e.g. zip-tie them to this mount) somewhere before they go into the TV.
5,This is the second of this brand of case that I have owned. I looked at many other cases before desiding on this one.  Couldn't find one that I liked better. The newer version (Designed for the iPad Pro) has a bigger cut out for the camera lens and for the home button. Nice improvements.  What I like best about this case is the handle.  Makes it so much easier to hold onto.  The newer version also tends to hold the tablet more securely.  I love the light blue color and am hoping that it doesn't get too dirty.  If it does I will just buy another color.  Love the case.
5,Nice feel.  I bought the red and like the shade; very normal red without being too bright.  All the holes end up in the right spot.  Fits in securely with a velcro flap so it won't slide.  I haven't dropped it and I am not sure how much "corner protection there would be but it feels secure enough for me as an adult to use around the house and for car trips etc.  The corner protection is just part of the leather case.  It would help cushion a tiny bit and would help keep the corner from chipping but not sure it would truly save from damage if you drop the iPad far enough or onto tile etc.  Still like I said I really like it for the price and my needs.
4,Ordered this CaseCrown IPad Air (corner protection) for my iPad Air recently purchased fromAmazon. It was reasonabley priced and offered a selection of colors. On receipt and inspection I found this case to fit properly and it looked great. Based on my purchase I would reccomend this product to anyone looking for a nicely priced attractive iPad Air case. Since I wrote this review I have purchased a second case for an additional I-Pad.
5,I wanted a case that looked more expensive than the silicone cases that are prevelant. What caught my eye in the description was the focus on corner protection. If you drop your phone or tablet the corners get the brunt of the impact. This product seems to have a little more protection.It's not real leather but looks more expensive. I saw a silicone case the other day on someone's tablet and the silicone seams were curling.Another benefit of this case is the magnetic strip sleep/wake feature. As soon as I flip the cover over to start using my iPad the screen display is up ready for me to swipe. I liked that. The case is more substantial than the silicone cases in my opinion. For under $17 I thought this was a great deal.
5,Packed very well.  Sounds great adds power and crispness.  You can use as a paper weight if it doesn't work out for you cuz its built like a tank and is pretty heavy.  I changes the tubes to NOS RCA's and it did improve the sound not night and day diff but enough to make it worth it.  People worry about the heat. I have many guitar tube amps and don't find this amp excessively hot just normal considering the way its built.  It gives the impression of being hotter because of the thick armor like plate chasis which retain the heat more than typical guitar amp thin chasis.  It feels very solid.
5,To be honest I wasn't expecting much from this amp even after all the great reviews I read. This was the first "audiophile" product that blew my mind on first listen. My main amp right now is the JDS El amp and I think its incredible. After listening to the Darkvoice for a couple of days ' even with stock tubes' it sounds amazing. I prefer the "tube sound". Everyone says the stock tubes are crap but they sound amazing to me. Tubes add soul to the music in my opinion. the dac I am using is the JDS labs ol dac.
5,When researching HDMI cables for my new home theater system I found many differing opinions. Most electronic store employees told me that expensive cables are necessary for a high quality picture and sound. Yet I saw the reviews of this product on amazon and people were saying this product is great even though it doesn't cost a lot. Well guess what? The reviews on this site are correct.I've been using these HDMI cables for a few weeks with no problems whatsoever. I have one for my PS3 and one for my HDTV. These cables work perfectly.It seems that the whole HDMI cable business is a bit sketchy. Why would anyone pay $100 for HDMI cables? I have no idea. These cables were very inexpensive and get the job done as advertised. I could not be happier with this purchase.
4,Just what we needed and works great.
4,Good....
4,Removed 1 star as the price is expensive.This worked to connect an HD Comcast cable box via HDMI to a Slingbox 500 using the component cables. For the price they should have included the component cables along with an extra HDMI cable.
1,Terrible product! Not only is the audio quality bad the audio keeps breaking up. Played same audio with other headphones and they worked like a charm. And it’s wired bluetooth headphones? Doesn’t make sense. The volume buttons don’t do anything either.
1,Looking for a cheap set of earbuds to use when working outside...Bought these and plugged the first set in and got great sound until the third time I used them when I got no sound out of one of them.  Tried the second set to see if it worked...it did...then promptly hit the return button on Amazon.As an aside the reviews for this product are anything but...they talk about all sorts of things other than the earbuds.
4,Technically speaking this in on my wife's new Ipad so I am kind of speaking on her behalf.  The fit was perfect no missing stitching or loose parts and the magnetic closure mates well and functions as designed.  Ihave not heard a peep from her about the functionality of the cover.  She would let me know if it was not working.  I am happy with the choice.
2,It is what it says it is so that’s why this isn’t a 1 Star review but I have had and I’m still having one heck of a time installing the M.2 drive I bought this screw for because this will NOT come with the screwdriver needed and the screw hole is NOT a standardized size (both of which should be a no brainers but it would have been helpful to say that somewhere). If you’re a professional and only need one go for it. But I’d highly recommend buying a set with a screwdriver a screwdriver separately that’s magnetized or just simply a set with more than one screw if this is your first time. (Returns to hunt for that one blasted screw for the 4th time)
5,A lot bigger than I first assumed it would be from other pictures I’ve seen. The sound stage is incredible to say the least. This amp even manages to save the lower end headphones where they are lacking. Not necessarily recommended for anyone is is looking for convenience and no maintenance. The tubes supplied should be upgraded if you want the most for your money. Beware tubes get as hot as a light bulb and will burn anything they touch. Very premium build very hefty and sounds wonderful! Definitely a must have for old school listening and maximum sex appeal.
4,I purchased one for myself and one as a gift. I like the quality of the nook simple touch case.I do not have the "glowlight" with mine and this case fits snug! My only negative is that I wish their was less materials around the corners that hold the nook simple touch in place. I put skins on my ereader and these corners/sides cover up alot of the skin. Would love to see a variety of colors: light green grey brown oranges. Other than that I am pleased with my purchase!  Thank you
5,If you are using a HD OTA antenna for multiple TVs throughout the house this device works well.I recently installed an attic antenna for local HD OTA programming.  I was able to use the existing coax connections installed by my cable provider however there was some pixilation on the distant room TVs [we have 4 on three levels].  We got immediate signal improvement by replacing the existing splitter with this device.  This device does require a power source and also has a grounding wire attachment point which is convenient.No more pixilation and a sharp quality picture.
1,Sound is surprisingly good - but they last 2 days each till they break. You get what you pay for. terrible quality.
1,The items did not work. I tried to use on more than 2 iPhones and they were not compatible. I gave 1 star because I had to just to leave a comment
1,Crap do not buy - neither pair I bought ever worked.
5,Fits my Kindle HD 8.9 like a glove. The leather or leather like exterior material looks good and feels and looks like real leather. All the cut outs are where they should be for access. Stand works good. Wakes up when the cover opens goes to sleep when it is closed (magnet). Nice interior suede all inside. Device is very secure in this. I probably keep this until I can find something better or real leather. Was not going to pay $55 for the Kindle Leather case. I highly recommend this product. For the price you won't be disappointed!By the way: The magnet has a dual purposes while securing your Kindle when shut it also works as a switch to wake or put your kindle to sleep by triggering an inductor in the Kindle with magnetism when you close or open your cover.
1,If you have ear canals the size of elephants!If you want these to work right DON’T MOVE!!Save your money. Buy something else.
3,Have had this for a month or so and it’s already spotty using it. Worked well at first. Now Sometimes it works. More often though it doesn’t. Will not buy again.
1,Not at all what I wanted should have returned them
4,Well I ordered this and it came a little before it estimated which was good. It was pretty confusing taking it out of the package. I put it on and bubbles were all over the screen. So I read the instructions and it said "if bubbles on screen then use a credit card to scrape to Edges. That worked pretty well. It scratches pretty easy. I would highly recommend this item for the price but if your looking for a very high quality screen protecter then just buy a more expensive one.
1,It worked only a day or two.. then sound reduced and wire connections didn’t work well. Didn’t even last one week.
5,This thing is big and heavy! Make sure you have room for it wherever you decide to place it. Sounds pretty good with stock tubes but its not amazing. The on/off switch is extremely satisfying to play with even if I shouldn't. The one I have doesn't mute the pre-amp outs when you plug headphones in so that feature is useless to me. Not sure if that's by design or not but I can't use it to listen on headphones without disturbing others if the speakers are also going. I mainly use these with a set of HD600s and they sound great. Perfect pairing for me.
1,These earbuds are a waste of money. They have a lot of static.
1,This was a two pack of headphone neither works.  Waste of money and really frustrating.  So crappy.
4,The mount is easy to install and very sturdy. As you can see in the pic its holding my 55" LCD TV pretty strudily. The reason I give it a 4 star is that some of the hardware provided was not well assembled ( talking about the round handles that are provided to secure the TV in the tilted position).Overall it served my purpose quite satisfactorily
1,These headphones are a waste of money and are not compatible with my iPhone 11. I plugged in both and can’t hear any sound from the videos I’m playing I wish I had just gone to Apple and pay them for headphones. This was a waste of money and I do not recommend them.
1,There's only one size. What happened to the original iphone headphones that came with 3 different size earbuds? These are ridiculous...some of us have smaller (or maybe larger) ears...you can't send everyone the same size it doesn't work.These are not the original iphone ear buds.
1,Es una total estafa no tiene nada de calidad el material es súper malo el título dice 2 y solo me llegó uno y encima ni siquiera funciona no hace nada no compren esto.
5,Man-o-man this amp is nice! I read several reviews about changing tube which I still plan to do but it sounds great as is. Not sure if they changed their tubes since those prior tubes. I was nervous at first because there was a slight hum and noise on mids but that went away after about1-2 hour burn. I listened to some Marley today and wow it sounds great! Nice wide soundstage and nice warmth. My final Audio sonorous cans are somewhat bright so this was just what I needed. Excited to see what tube rolling will bring me.
1,They were great until they quite playing. Maybe lasted an hour before i couldn't connect to music. I had 2 that both stopped working!
1,presents itself as Bose Wireless headphones...100% scam
1,Uncomfortable. Can’t hear much. The people on the other line told me the ear my voice going in and out.
5,I bought this knowing all the reviews stated you should change the tubes and there was a hum on the left.  Got mine from the manufacturer all the way here to little olde New Zealand no hum or hiss it soulds great.  And it arrived a week earlier so thanks for that.  Eventually I will tube swap because its possible and there are so many to pick from .  Great sound out of the box without issues. So happy.
4,Works just fine. These cables are a bit expensive but I imagine that has to do with it being a somewhat-obscure connector.
1,They sound and are very cheap!
5,does the job well Sony made a such bad job with a charging port on the camera body so I found good solution by buying it  highly recommend.
1,We bought these hoping for a good deal. Both sets of head phones lasted approximately 1 week each before they began to not work. Lost hearing in one ear then second. Do not recommend.
1,They never worked  tried them out on three different iPhone and 2 IPad.  No sound whatsoever.
2,Doesn’t seem to work for connecting my monitor 3.5mm audio output to my DAC/Amp coaxial.There was also I little mould of rubber at the base of the pin keeping it from plugging in all the way. No sure what’s up with that or if it’s intentional. But there was a thin layer riding up the pin so I removed it and the whole piece came out.
4,Perfectly functional. Takes a minute to break in so that it will stand properly but its a great fit. Doubt I will be able to charge and stand it at the same time as there is not enough clearance to accommodate the plug but that is a problem for Amazon Kindle designers to figure out. Easy assess to all ports and controls otherwise. Sound not in any way obstructed; In fact I think it forces the sound waves towards you as you watch and actually sounds better in the case.
3,Product works as advertised but I had to scramble to add a USB to wall outlet converter.  Many A/V components have a USB for data (pictures movies music) but not for a continuous power supply.  For the price it should be all inclusive and have a power converter.
4,The unit is solidly built and easy to use for cabling. Worked great for my house.
1,It shorted immediately after first use. Then worked in both ears only for a little over a month. So I missed the 30 day return window. I should've returned it after the first short.
3,I should have listened to the other reviewer who brought this up before but it was so cheap I took a chance. I wanted to either run a signal from a digital TV antennae or my VCR into a VGA input on an LCD monitor via the composite outs. This won't do it- it looks like a signal CONVERTER is needed to make this happen. I gave it three stars because it was so cheap and the seller got it to me in a hurry- no need to mess up anyone's rating for my mistake.
4,I bought this screen protector for my iPad 3. Although slightly difficult to put on the directions were easy to understand and for the most part I got it on without bubbles. There are two total only one however is visibly "annoying". This is the first screen protector I've put on a screen this size so I assume it's probably going to be impossible to get one on with absolutely no bubbles. I think for the price it's great. It fit perfectly works well with my case and was shipped quickly.
1,The earbuds are much louder than any others and do not adjust well. Plus after just a few weeks the first pair is only working on one side. The music quality is very good put on podcasts it far too loud.
5,My Kindle HD 8.9 fits snug in this case. I could not see paying $30 or more dollars for a case so for about $16 this case gets the job done. It has the right cutouts for all the buttons also holes punched out on the back for the speakers. At first I put my Kindle in the case upside down which meant the speaker holes did not line up or the on and off button. Took me about a week until I noticed then I changed it to the way it should be. I do not think you would be disappointed if you buy this case.July 2015....As a followup to this review I use my Kindle everyday it travels to work with me and this case if still going strong. Just can't seem to wear it out.
1,It doesn’t make any scene a pack of two headphones are both horrible both sounds ridiculous. These headphones sounds horrible the music and call sounds so muffled. I will never purchase another pair of headphones from this company.
1,These are bluetooth but must be plugged in.  Maybe that is why they have so much static.  I didn't read the description and thought they were just standard plug in.
5,I am not using this item for an audio application. I am using it in a ham radio application as a short extension for a telegraph keying line. It's perfect for what I needed to do. Quality seems great to me. I would recommend this product for audio applications too. Very happy with it.
1,Tried both pair neither worked
5,I bought this case for my Kindle HD8.9 mainly because of the sale price.  This turns out to be quite a nice case for less than half what I paid for the case for my Kindle Fire which I bought at a large chain store.  It fits my Kindle perfectly and has an auto-on feature that I like very well as it allows you to turn your Kindle on just by opening the case doing away with pushing the on-off button every time. This case offers a fair amount of protection but it is by no means an Otter Box.  I think it is adequate for most situations if you are reasonably careful.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting a nice case for a very good price.
4,The case is great. The cover flap is awsome the magnet is both secure and does the wake/sleep function.  The interior that holds the kindle in is very secure. Does cover the screen edge quite a bit. A plus for knowing it won't fall out & protecting the edges but not the most attractive. The stand is not the best only offers one position which doesn't allow enough angle to view the screen very well.  Able to access all buttons and charge device with cover on.
3,If you don't see a reason to pay $40-$100 for a case as I did you shouldn't be disappointed. This item was exactly as described and protects my kindle well. As far as Amazon goes if you are looking for an online company you can trust look no further! Amazon Customer service is simply put the best there is! In most cases whatever happens Amazon will do all they can to treat you right! I would buy this product again and recommend it as a fair alternative to the cases that cost almost just as much as the item it's protecting.
4,I like the CaseCrown case that I bought it fits great and I feel  like it keeps my kindle Fire safe from my clumsy self.  I have only one thing I'd like to change about it I wish it had a "hand hold" (you know what I mean) on the back of it so I could  hold it easier when I'm sitting in a chair reading.  I don't put it on a table much.  Other than that I really do like it.
4,Very nice case. The inside is really soft to the touch.The red color is bright and pretty.I just wish it would stand better. But the restI like very much.
5,Wow! Actually worked. I used the usb power port on the back of the new FIOS one box for power and attached the component cables to my slingbox 500 and it worked. 3 am in Tokyo and I’m watching my TV in New York. Now if I could only get some sleep.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             They don’t work at all no sound comes out at all. Would like my money back. This is a rip off.
5,Despite my headline the stock tubes worked fine but you'll probably want to replace them just from knowing third party tubes will likely sound a percentage better.Note: I got the left channel hum after replacing the amp tube. The solution is to pull out the power tube and let the remaining tube 'burn in' for up to 72 hours.
3,I am not sure it is 40 feet long as described. I did not measure before installing it.  After running it through I found that it was short 2 or 3 feet  Despite that I measured my project 2 or 3 times and gave plenty extra feet ! ( gave 5 extra feet )The cable is good quality flexible and no noticeable signal loss.My advice:If you order this item MEASURE it before or you may have a problem as mine
5,So far so good for my iPad Air. I was concerned because many of the reviews were for older iPads. Many complained of the sleep/wake featurenot working and iPad not fitting properly.Case looks niceIt fits my iPad Air (it slides a little but I've had that issue with other tablet cases too. No biggie)The sleep/wake feature works just fine.Very slim and comfortable to holdThere is a smell to it but it doesn't bother me much. I got a kindle fire case for a gift for someone and had to air it out for a week before gifting it so this didn't bother me at alliPad stands up fine in two positions. Positioned on table sofa and my lap without iPad falling down
4,I got the Acer Iconia Tab A100 but insisted I wasn't going to take it out of the house without accessories.  The product actually shipped in two days.  The case?  Perfect. Headphones? Great.  The stylus?  Ok.  And so great to have hdmi cable--all for less than $20!  Oh and the screen protector?  Well I couldn't put it on without bubbles so....Anyway the case is the screen protector which by the way also doubles as a stand.
1,Didn’t even have these a month and both headphone stopped working . One of the headphones broke while unplugging from phone and the tip stayed stuck in my phones charging port .  waste of money. .
4,Fit perfectly on iPad but didnt last me long. Would purchase again.
5,Bought this for two reasons: 1) to allow my antenna signal to feed my TV and my HD Home Run.  Performs flawlessly meets expectations. 2) To see  if boosting my antenna signal would lesson the OTA dropouts I was getting.  The vendors go to great lengths to explain that the device DOES NOT IMPROVE a weak signal. This was the case for #2.  However it is a well-built solid device that will allow you to feed up to 4 different OTA devices. Recommended.
4,the case is good and the hdmi wire works great just consider that you are buying this two items. the screen protector quality is poor and the pen will not even work but for the price this is ok.I have an acer Iconia 100 I use to have a samsung galaxy cover on it but this case will fit perfectly and the back camera is open to take pictures.go ahead and buy this it will work without the luxury of another brand
1,They didn’t work
1,They did not work for my iPhone 13 pro max. I gave them away to my nieces
1,The sound is very bad. They are already falling apart.  Very disappointed.
1,I bought these for handsfree phone calls. The audio is great but the mic doesn’t work at. The person I’m talking to can barely hear me:( wish I’d saved the packaging so I could return them.
3,Didn’t work on my project
1,These headphones are terrible. I received them on 5/29/2022 it’s now 6/8/2022 they are very staticky and sound goes on and off.  I would not recommend buying these.  it’s a two pack so hopefully the other ones work out better than these once.
4,Some iPad cases are just basic covers. This one wraps around the iPad on all sides. The materials seem high quality. The hand-hold strap on the back is surprisingly useful. Before you buy a case without a handle on the back try holding yours up for a while as you watch some videos or whatever. You'll discover that the iPad is actually heavy and hard to hold. The easel isn't as easy to use as you'd expect but we don't use it much anyway.
5,Was concerned with it not being the right size for my Asus Z270H Gaming motherboard there were posts out there stating that it had a proprietary m.2 mounting screw size however this worked perfectly. Alot of negative reviews regarding the price however out of hours of searching i could not find a vendor out there that sold this screw unless it was in a 100 pack and not exactly what i needed on top of that so was worth the price considering the only other option i found was from unsecure websites.
3,I purchased this for my husband's iPad 3. it fits but it was difficult to line it up and keep it lined up as you try to squeezy the air bubbles out. and i could not get all the air out. On other screen protectors the micro bubbles come out over time but it has been on for a few weeks and still see them when the screen is off. Fortunatly you cant see them when the screen is on and it had keep it protected for scratches and the pen of our 3 year old.
1,One set worked for a week the other set worked for about 2 weeks.  Shoot dang
1,U get what u pay for. Fuzzy sound. The speakers in side the ear jingle around. Horrible
1,These did not last long. Broke within a few weeks :(
1,These are NOT Apple MFi Certified. 1st pair arrived damaged. 2nd pair when you plug in says “beats” and connect to other devices that are using Bluetooth
1,You have to use bluetooth with these headphones for some reason and they have active noise cancellation that you can not turn off which just sounds like static throughout all of your audio. The lowest volume setting on iphone is ear piercingly loud.
1,does not fit well in one's ear - either bad design or my ears are weirddoes not work (well) with iphone - if you have a case (who doesnt) you might have trouble pushing it inpoor sounds quality - crap
4,Unable to control the remote on the receiving side. Not sure if there is something set wrong on the cable box or the HDMI component.
5,I tried another brand and it did not work because it had an HDMI input but not an HDMI output.  This one is much pricier but it works.I can get video and audio but there is no software yet for the new FIOS ONE remote.  That means I cannot select channels.  Hopefully Slingbox will provide the software for the remote soon.
5,I see disappointment from some reviews. I don't know was I just lucky not having any problem with the protector? I couldn't be happier with the result. I had anti-glare protector before this protector and the decreased resolution hurt my eyes. So I went for the clear one. It is not fun to install a screen film on the device whatever it is. I have so much presure not to fail it. I aligned and attached it on the screen all the way down. Then I would've needed to push bubbles away like I did with other protectors. I was completely wrong there was no bubble on surface at all! It was first time ever I succeeded it at a first try! I wished the company has iPhone 5 screen proctector too!
1,Both sets only lasted  2 weeks where good at first than 1 set stoped workingand 2 nd set only 1 ear price works
3,The item is as described.  The hole in the top of the protector is slightly offset from the camera.  It doesn't block the camera opening but if you like things symmetrical you might want to check and see if others are not offset.  The other thing would be to take a hole punch and just enlarge the hole for the front camera before applying.  For the money it is still a good value or if you don't do facetime or use the front camera you will never notice.
2,The product’s HDMI video works as promised. However the device’s HDMI pass thru strips your input Dolby signal and pass PCM out. So it can’t be used inline into an A/V system usefully. When I tried to get support to just confirm this question. I ran into a brick wall ! Frontier support refused to answer any technical questions because I didn’t have an account even though my contact with them was through Amazon’s support. When I told their support I would be forced to return the product support person could care less. I will never buy another product from Frontier based on this experience.
1,First even though they have a cord a "beats" blue tooth pops up.  You can barely hear and when I would speak people stated my voice was not clear. Save your money and do not buy
1,I would give this item zero stars. The earbuds did not work at all neither pair. I plugged into my phone and music played from my phone and not into the earphones. Defective. Disappointing. Not sure how there are so many good reviews. Beware these do not work at all! Do not waste your time or money.
5,The only thing I haven't used yet is the HDMI cable since I haven't connected my tablet to my computer.  The case fits perfectly and does what I wanted it to do.  The Stylus well I'm not real fond of them but it works really well when my finger is just to big.  The headset it quite clear didn't realize how loud they were going to be when I first used them had to yank them out of my ears they were so loud.  My fault there.  The screen protector....well it works great but operator error there again.  Why is it so hard to NOT get stuff stuck underneath of it?  I wish they were washable.  All in all a good deal.
1,These head phones do not work after only 4 months.
5,I bought this for a trip we were taking so I had everything in one place. The quality of this product is better than I have seen at a higher price and the large amount of storage space allowed me to put all our family's electronics in one spot.  I can not tell you the amount of times I have been asked " have you seen my charging cable etc." Now I just hand them the case!  :)Thanks for the great product.Shawna
1,Knockoff headset noise when you plug in.
5,Have used the cord for several weeks now with no issue. connects the phone to aux in is detected correctly on both sides and sends music to the car sound system with no issue.
3,It takes too long to charge a battery. Otherwise it is good to carry on your trip.
1,Worst headphones ever!!!
5,I'm giving it 5 stars because it is really a great product. I thought I was going to use more the hand holder but it doesn't always fit how I want to hold my iPad. The apple pencil magnetic sleeve it's amazing. I haven't lost that pencil since I got the case. The kickstand part of it it's not as great as others there's only one position to it basically. I am considering buying a different case just because I'm tired of the color and realize I don't need all the functionality of this case. I'm going to a general smart cover.
4,I dropped my iPad on the corners and this case protected it. I took out one of the stars because this one is not cut appropriately for iPad Air. The case runs almost in the edge of home button and the edges of the case is not equidistant from iPad screen ends. Overall this is a value for money product although I'd like the price of this product to be decreased to make it more value for money.
1,These headphone are completely nonsense. You need to plug them into the iPhone. Oooh but wait there’s more!! You also need to turn on Bluetooth to use them.
1,Left ear died in less than a week. Right one was scratchy from day one. Really cheap quality.
1,The sound quality was bad for music ok for podcasts. The earbuds went out one at a time within 2 weeks. Comfort was fine. Do not recommend though.
3,I bought this for my boyfriend 2 Christmases ago and as much as he loved this it blew out within a couple of months. I've tried contacting the vendor and the warranty company and received an inquiry e-mail about the issue from the vendor but no response to my response. This amp sounded amazing when it worked. It's a good device for the most part.
4,Everything was mailed on time. The case fit my tablet perfectly; not too tight not too loose. I don't normally use stylus but it actually comes in handy. The screen protector was good I just didn't know how to put it on. The only reason I rated this a 4 star is because the headphones are bad quality. I expected them to be cheap anyways but the mic pieces like broke the second day I used them.
1,The sound was ok but a month in one side of the earbuds stopped working. Thought maybe it was jus that pair and moved on to the second pair. That didn’t last long either.
4,does what i wanted it to do.  granted now i don't do what i was doing that way anymore...it was cheap enough to try out.  40 feet of cable can be a little unwieldy...would have been nice if they had bundled a velcro cable strap or two with this.
4,Easy and lots of room!
3,The cover is ok if you just want basic protection for your ipad. What I didn't like is that the thing that holds the cover when you want to use it as a stand wears out very quickly if you use it a lot then it starts to fail and make your ipad fall down because it won't stay in the lip that's supposed to hold it.I bought the red cover and the color of the red is very nice. Looks good and is light to carry.
1,Worst quality.
4,ordered from eforcity. case does not look like leather but does the job. screen protector seems very good. make sure screen is 100% clean before applying the screen protector. if neccesary  bend the squeegy (to make it stronger) to get rid off the stubborn bubbles. ear bud is not Sony but sound quite nice for movies not for music. hdmi cable work like it is supposed to. i had no use of stylus.
5,I really hope it lasts forever like it feels it will. Even with stock tubes it sounds better “fuller” than any solid state I own.
5,My friend cant thank me enough for this gift. Certainly must have for the wine connoisseurs makes opening wine easier. I’ve used some other models that were not as powerful as this  this has plenty of power and battery seems to last longer.
4,works well like the channel master better. power plug didn't work well with this amp. I used the one that came with my old channel master amp. and that worked the best.
4,this is fairly good quality. the ipad is held in place with a velcro buckel. one issue i have: the holder for the apple pencil can some times get in the way of the things that hold the ipad upwards. it's not a big deal but it does happen.
4,This is a nice case and it protects the Kindle great! However when you stand it up the screen is very near a 90 degree angle making it a bit of a pain to look at. There is another angle you can stand it at though on the back of the case rather than how it is standing in the picture which I actually prefer to the standard way anyway. I do recommend these cases.
1,If there was zero stars that’s what I’d give it. My product did not work at all and idk how to get a refund
5,I have bought 4 packs of these discs and have been happy with them. (Mostly for burning audiobooks.) They are not too thin as many major brands sell. And I've had no trouble with making coasters. Note - these come with no center spindle to hold the stack so re-use one from a previous purchase.
3,The discs are fine and were exactly what I looked for. But the seller used the very cheapest jewel cases you can imagine. It's hard to believe they can make plastic so thin. At least a third of the jewel cases were already broken when I opened the package and others would crack when you literally just touched them. I would much rather have had them on a spindle container rather than placed into the "jewel cases" they provided.
5,The quality of the product was obvious as soon as I took it out of the packaging. The stitching is precise and very clean and accurate. My kids are always leaving headphones and stereo jacks and things like that around the house so this is something that I will use all the time. Not just for travel. I am going to buy a couple more of these for gifts for people that always have a tangled mess of courts at their house or car.
4,Great price for a bracket that works exactly like the ones twice it's price. The instructions are tough to follow as they were obviously translated from another language into English but it's not rocket science to figure this out. The screws that secure the bottom bracket are really had to get to once this is hanging on the wall but the weight of the TV holds it in place on the bracket just fine.
1,These headphones do not work with apple iPhone. Do not buy!!!
1,For some strange reason these earbuds use bluetooth eventhough they are wired ... I had to wait for it to connect everytime I plug them. They worked for a week and now it says connected and audio keeps running but I cant hear a thing. Completely useless.
4,Perfect fit.
3,This is easily the least expensive case that I've ever seen for a tablet.  Although it's not the best made case I've ever seen it does what it's supposed to do i.e. protects the screen and the Kindle well.  My only complaint about this case is that when opened the cover puts pressure on the charger cord if it is plugged in.  It would have made more sense to design it so that it slid into the case the other way.
1,After getting the second set (first set came broken) i plugged in the earbuds.  First it said it had to sync like they were wireless ad when they did sync the sound quality was terrible.  It sounded like the other person was in a wind tunnel.  The feel/weight also felt cheaply made.
5,No
5,Works great and way cheaper than the Sony brand z battery charge.  It might charge a bit slower than the Sony but that wasn't a problem for me.  I also like how it plugs right into the wall just like the older Sony chargers used to.
4,I haven't really had a chance to use it yet as I just got it. It arrived 3 days late but once I saw it it looked great. Not as dark red as the picture showed. I like the fact that it will protect the corners which is one of the main reasons I chose the Pro. I have nothing bad to say about. I'm really happy with my purchase.
4,The adaptor was pretty pricy. It did help to make the Sling Box work with the new cable providers new equipment.
4,Really an excellent value for the price.  Would like it better if it would also tilt the TV from side to side but can hardly complain for the cost of the investment.  Purchased this for a 36" TV and the frame was visible from behind the TV so sawed off the tops extra unnecessary length of the frame and painted the rough edges with rustoleum.  Now it's perfect!
5,I love this case!  The pencil holder is very good the magnet holds it tight to the case I have a tablet sleeve I use when I travel with my iPad the pencil is always secure to case it has never come off in the sleeve.  The hand strap makes it nice to hold while I am drawing or reading and the stand is perfect for watching movies.  The magnets in the case are very strong and hold the case closed  I highly recommend this case😁 Well worth the money
1,Was sent one pair when paid for a two pack. These are wired headphones but when plugged into i-phone they register as "baets" and set off bluetooth. Sound quality really bad.
4,This helped bypass the incorrect display settings on the security dvr screen.  So if you ever change the settings to a high dpi beyond the monitor and well get visually locked out this product will save the day.
1,Description says compatible w/ iphone7...... Apparently my trusty old '7' doesn't know that.  2 sets neither work.  Tried everything I read online to try to get them to work but all I hear is the usual constant ringing in my ears.  Not a sound from these earbuds.
1,Cheaply made; poor sound quality; stops working and could not hear anything out of either side.
3,My wife has the smaller Kindle Fire and has a case that allows for the Kindle to rotate within the case itself to give it multiple ways to stand.  This case is good but really has only two ways to allow the Kindle to stand and both are in the horizontal position.  There is no way to stand it up vertically.  Or at least i can't figure it out and there were no directions included.
3,Work fine it’s what you think it is. But they don’t stick to magnetic screwdrivers well and you really have to be good with a screwdriver to not drop it.
4,After I've lost the previous m.2 screw I've purchased this product its great but the price is a bit high. 4 Stars because the priceWorks with my MSI B350 Gaming PLUS Motherboard + Samsung 960 EVO 500GB
1,the one side does not work
4,Used this to distribute and boost signal from Digital antenna on roof to 4 TV's in house. Works great.the small tool wont fit on any of my standard cable terminals
1,The sound quality was good and they were comfortable but after a 2 or 3 days of usage the sound goes out in one ear. I would not buy again
5,We have several nooks in the family and having them jacketed in these lovely bright protectors makes them easy to find and identify.I reviewed the pink one earlier and it is exactly the same except for color.  Nice soft leather the cover folds behind for easy holding.  It will not prop the book up for you vertically or horizontally the way some covers will.There is a pocket for your library card or a slip of paper with your library numbers.  Not really room for anything else.You can access the buttons and electrical attachment but have to remove it to put the micro sd card in and out.I think that's everything.  I love them.
2,This is one of those Amazon products that gets high ratings because of the price. This is not a great product by any means. I have used expensive and cheap TV wall mount brackets in the past and this is the lowest quality one I have found. The wall frame was out of square the bubble level was not true and the overall feel is flimsy.I use the mount for a 40" Samsung LCD. The product claims to be able to hold up to a 60" tv but I would not recommend that. I probably would have giving the product 1 star but it is priced very low. I would imagine that most people who rated this product gave an extra star or two just because of the price. Set your expectations accordingly.
5,Received a new TV box device. Did not have component plugs needed for the Slingbox. Slingbox website had a link for this device. Very simple to connect everything together. Works perfectly. Downside is it did not come with a usb brick for plugging into power. Also wish it didn't cost so much.
4,Happy with this quality is there and looks very nice. Red is brighter than the photo this. Photo has a slightly deeper red and this is more firetruck loud. By the time I realized the red was really too bright I had already thrown the box away.
4,This thing is very similar and in some ways better than the $130 wall bracket I bought from Best Buy.At under $30 why allow your self to be ripped off by the Consumer Electronic chains?It was easy to install is strong and as adjustable as the more expensive units.I returned the $130 one and saved $100 on my TV install.
4,The product description stated that this cable would connect your laptop to your television.  I guess it does connect them if by that you mean an end plugs into both devices.  This cable WILL NOT allow you to watch your laptop on your television.  Instead of buying this go ahead and buy a converter.  There are several under $20 that work great!
2,I can't really fault the screw or the standoff for this there's a 50/50 chance any part like this will work. Just turns out that it didn't fit well in my scenario. The standoff is shorter than the provided one for M.2 drives on the motherboard itself so SSD's will be sagging/angled if it's used. The screw is absolutely tiny in its width you could probably fit 2.5-3 of them in the standoff provided by AsRock.I'm sure it fits well for some people and not so well for others I just got unlucky.
5,This is the first time I used wall mount and was not sure what to buy. I needed to hang two TVs Sharp 60" LED and Vizio 42" LED. So I bought this mount and cheetah mount (ASIN: B0012S4APK) based on high ratings. I found this mount stronger but little smaller than Cheetah. As such both can hold the weight of any modern TVs upto 60~65" weight upto 100lbs(keeping margin of 40~50lbs). The installation was quick and easy you will need a stud finder a drill/driver and wrenches. Stud finding was the only difficult part apart from that every thing was smooth. I don't see an reason to buy those expensive mounts if this thing is doing the job.
4,This fits the old glowlight just perfect.  My only gripe would be the odor when you open the package.  It's sealed in a plastic bag and it's got that shipped from China in a container smell.  I've bought other things with the same smell and it fades over a period of months.  Just leave it out and handle it and it goes away.
1,Didn’t work
5,I have a Toshiba DVR purchased years ago.  Although it has an HDMI port to connect it to my Smart TV-- it just works best with AV cables.  I can actually record now-- anything I want.. and make my own DVRs. So cool!  If you can't afford to subscribe to the DVR option for these cable companies-- if you happen to have a DVR (Recorder)-- in your possession-- this is the route to take. -$
3,Bought this two pack. Used the one a month later wanted to add another nvme to motherboard and quickly realized that the second m.2 standoff screws threading was botched. Too late to return. Will not buy again from this vendor again.
2,There is no fix. Not even sure recycling will accept. So the $9 price is like a $1/mo rental.
3,I used this item to take a bnc cat5 cable and convert it to VGA so i could have a display monitor for my camera system. This is the second time i have purchased this because overtime the soldering and the usb power cable became damaged
3,Can't beat the price I paid for this case.  The case opens backwards not the way you would open a book.  If I was to open it the correct way my Kindle loads upside down.  Yes it automatically turns on its own but in my opinion if the case was correct it would not have to turn.  I wish there were different angles to position the Kindle instead of only one.
1,sounded awful on multiple devices. returned them
5,The amp sounds great and adds a warm and smooth tone to my music the way tubes are supposed to. The stock tubes that it comes with were perfectly fine and I had no burn in problems or humming that others mention. After using the stock tubes for a while and being satisfied I decided to explore some RCA tubes and have been even more pleased with the sound.
4,After a year of use the back two flaps no longer hold up the iPad.  I am back looking to buy a new cover that has a different design.
4,I have several of these and they are truly a help at conserving space and getting organized.  This one was a wee bit disappointing because the originals all have a leather like coating and this is just plastic.  Wish they would leave a good thing alone.  Plus I want things that I keep out to match.  Otherwise a good product
5,I was so nervous as this was the first TV I've ever mounted.  I bought the TV and ordered this mount on the same day.  It arrived within a few days.  We bought a stud finder separately and attached this mount with no trouble at all.  My TV is 50 inches and this holds it great.  It is hard to get behind the TV once you have it mounted so I suggest plugging everything in (dvd games etc) and adjusting the tilt before you put the TV on the mount!!  Otherwise we had no issues it's been hanging in our kids room for a over a month and it perfect!
4,Like it..don't love it but it is way better than the one with rubber bands on all 4 corners.  Would have liked multiple angle options but all in all a great value. Do love the standby featue.Got it on time and am mostly happy with it.  I'm not sure there is a case/cover that offers total satisfaction.
4,Device works great! Slingbox was rendered useless w/o this lil thing. Did feel the price was a little steep but had no other options.
1,when plugged into phone something popped up on my it that said connect after connected nothing worked. for both.
4,The plastic tools were too soft but they did the job.
4,I did a lot for the 'Screen Protector'. I am good at to do that.But for the product no matter how hard I tried. I still got some bubbles on my screen.I found some very tiny dots from the film itself. I had to accept the fact.Here I still want to give it 4 star according to the great price.
4,Purchased these 25 foot long S-Video cables and they worked just fine. Please Note: S-Video does NOT incorporate AUDIO ONLY VIDEO and you still have to use RCA-Audio cables in conjunction with these cables to get audio (I learned this the hard way).  These cables are harder to locate today as everything is going HDMI as it does include audio in the digital transmission.
5,Awesome sound (once the tubes are broke-in).  Beautiful match to my Skull Candy Aviator headphones.  Makes the old music sound like back in the day.  Highly recommend for people that do not want to spend a fortune on a higher-priced preamp because this can be used as a preamp as well as a headphone amp (There are pre-outs on the back of the unit).  Be careful of the power switch though as it can be easily broken off if not careful.  Other than that great preamp for the money.  Looks like the more higher-priced units on the market with the bottle-shaped tube.
4,Overall satisfied with the product and shipping was faster than I expected. Great value for what I ordered and price beats most competition.
5,I normally buy my cables from Monoprice but these looked much nicer than what they had for only a couple of bucks more.  Actually I consider it a tossup since the Y cable in this set is 12" instead of only 6" at Monoprice.  These are very substantial (read: well shielded) cables with robust and tight fitting connectors.  I have seen some outrageous prices for subwoofer cables like these but I think it has been pretty well documented what an incredible waste of money the high-priced cables are.  Buy with confidence from this super fast shipping company.
5,Like most of the other reviewers I upgraded my graphics card. My power supply was up to the job but didn't have an 8-pin connector... and the graphics card doesn't come with this kind of adapter anymore. For less than half of what the card manufacturer wanted to charge me for an adapter this one does the job. The wiring is right and tight -- no complaints.
3,The case is like cardboard ane you have to take it off to charge it.The stylus is worthless.The earphones are fine.putting a screen protector on is a pain but I was satisfied with it.The auxiliary cords are fine as well.The HDMI cord is nice and works fine.All in all not a bad deal I will just buy a better case and I throw the stylus away.
4,Very durable. I've dropped it a couple of times and this case protects the iPad. I've had this case for a year or so now and it's held up well with being used everyday thrown in my purse and work bag. Very good product especially with the low price.
5,So happy I got this battery  I can vacuum 80% more time than my old battery on zoom speed. Only bummer was I had to modify my wall hanger to hold it.
5,Another customer said they had a weird smell - yeah they do.  BUT so what?  They don't come on a spindle but I already had one so what?  So far they work like they're supposed too.  If anyone is looking for that smooth glossy finish that's easy to write on with a Sharpie - these are the ones you want.  I'll definitely buy them again.  AAAAA+++++
4,A bit pricey for a screw and a mount but it fit my asus tuf z270 mark 2 board to hold a new nvme m.2 ssd in place perfectly
5,i ordered this product just for the case without any great expectations for under $20.00.  The case is excellent quality fits very well.  The hdmi cable screen protector and head phones were also better than i expected..  The cas opens and holds the tablet at a nice angle for vewing and all the ports are available.  I almost didnt buy it beacaus i review said it didnt fit correctly but they are totally wrong.  i'mordering a second one for my daughter.  As far as the seller they reresent the product well perhaps even understarted and it arrived on the early side of the predicted ship date. Great seller fanastic product.
4,The quality is ok for the price. Each end is little loose. But otherwise good product
4,It fits well and the auto on feature is very nice.  Construction quality is very good.  I bought this and a cheaper related unit by the same company to see which I like.  I like the unit.  The quality is not a Zagg but it is a good backup when I don't want to use my keyboard model.
3,This is the second case of the same model and color that I have bought. The first one lasted about 16 months without any tears or issues so I ordered another one. The second one that I received a few weeks ago is already tearing in the same place as the first one around the corners. This one does not appear to be made with the same quality.
3,Worked for several days and screen went out. I have two of these changed power input and still the same. Thinking it’s inside the device problem.
5,My poor tablet was dying and would no longer hold a charge.  I installed this in no time at all charged it overnight and I am back in business.  I know that batteries don't/won't last forever and I will have to replace it again somewhere down the road but for right now my tablet is alive again.  I would definitely recommend this battery and the price is perfect.
1,They do not cancel any noise. They static and crackle.
1,Worked for a week or so then got the dreaded 'Accessory not supported' error.  both headphone give the same issue.  Not a huge expense but don't waste your money.
1,Broke in less than two weeks of regular use
3,These were fairly okay screen protectors. It's partly my fault for not wanting to pay such a high amount of money for screen protectors. For the most part however it does do the job that it was intended for so for that I am greatful. It was cut correctly but installation was actually fairly hard. Lots of bubbles but that is due to my inexperience I would expect.
4,Pros: Supports 3D on my ps3 and blurayCons: Does not seem to support ARC.Good cables for the price.  Perfect for most components but I just couldn't get it to work with ARC(Audio Return) from the TV to the receiver.  Another noticeably thicker cable that I had worked but couldn't get this one to work.
4,good protection easy access to all the controls/sockets/camera lens (be sure you know which issue ipad you have) my wife has ipad also so we went with different color cases to tell them apart without turning on .Tripod not the best design but I don't use 99% of time.
5,Works great.  The 3.5mm plug pinout is  Tip: Receive  Ring: Transmit  Sleeve: Groundso if you may need a null-modem adapter depending on the device at the other end.
1,Static right when you plug in messes up your phone function.  Does not play after you hear static
4,It worked very well with my acer A100 (even though the tablet was disappointing) The stylus is cheap but I didn't care and the screen cover and the headphones as well as the case work with my new tablet! (OK the camera hole is in the wrong spot but it does fit)  worth getting for your 7 inch tablet.
1,Both pair of headphones you can’t hear anything and I bought these a month ago and just now trying to use them and now I can’t return them
4,Great case. The red is stunning. It's a smooth clean cut professional looking case. Only thing is when I want to put it on a stand it requires more effort to slip it under the flap as opposed to other cases that have the trenches built in. But not bad for a first case. Fits my iPad air like a glove.
1,These were marketed as certified and they don’t work! Don’t connect at all!
1,This will be my first 1-star review but what else can I do when I cannot get this adapter to work?  I planned to use this to display my laptop output on my large screen HDTV.  When I couldn't get it to work I connected the laptop VGA output to a standalone PC monitor:  it worked so I know the laptop's VGA output and display adapter works.  The I disconnected the RCA output cables from a working VCR (so I know the RCA cables and HDTV input of those cables work) and connected the RCA video cable to this adapter and this adapter to the previously tested laptop VGA output but nothing gets to the HDTV.  The laptop's VGA output and display adapter work the RCA cable works the HDTV RCA input works so what's left?  Unless I'm missing something the problem has to be this adapter.  I thought I'd take a chance at the low price and longer wait to ship from China but in the end...this adapter does not work.
5,This amp is everything that I had expected through research. It is a high current well built headphone tube Amp with bad sounding Chinese vacuum tubes. Going into this purchase expect to replace the tubes. There are numerous tubes available. It sounds fantastic with NOS tubes (New Old Stock). I matched it with 600 OHM headphones and NOS vacuum tubes and have Ben on cloud 9 ever since. Years ago this type of amp was substantially more expensive. Expect to spend at least a hundred bucks on new tubes to make this amp shine.
5,Love love love that's all I can say this is an awesome set I've only had to charge it once and I've probably used it about 50 times
1,Stopped working after a couple weeks. Other pair broke away at base where it plugs into phone. No. Nope! We should be able to give 0 stars
1,This product is total crap - poor sound quality poor physical quality and the audio hurts my ears. Amazon should be ashamed to sell such a sub-standard product.
4,I like it.  Only downside is that the volume buttons and the screen lock button is located very closely to the back panel which isn't a problem with the case itself because it's inherent to the iPad Air.  Overall it's a good product.  I especially like the elastic hand strap which makes it easy to hold.
3,The cover is okay but not great. It slips constantly so the case covers the camera.  And it's hard to get it so this doesn't happen...so I hardly ever use the camera - too much of a hassle. Plus the design allows the case to prop up my iPad but it's a hassle.
5,Works well. I have used it over 6 months now and it is still working well.
4,Worked out of the box for me.  Great way to put an older VGA monitor to work.  Menu options are wonky tho.
1,Bought two pair. First set the left earpiece went out within weeks. Second set right earpiece went out in days!!
1,I could hear music but the phone quality was horrid. 0/10 would not recommend.
5,I was looking for some subwoofer cables. As i saw that my sub needed a Y jack and my receiver only has a single rca jack i started to look for the proper cables. A larger retail store had the cables i need but at 12 times the costI saw these on Amazon and i bought them. Later i went back to the larger retail store and found that the cables were of the same quality and i had save my self some money in the process. If you are looking for some good cables at a reasonable price give these a try cant go wrong.
4,Works like a charm with my new Xfinity 1 box. It came with no directions so had to search online for the hookup hence only 4 stars.
5,Finally getting my DVDs organized in the Discgear 100e. Absolutely love it. Also love the fact that I can go online & create an Index for my movies. The online software however can be time consuming if you wish to alphabetize your list. They do not make that easy to do. May be best to create the list in a spreadsheet then copy/paste or retype into the online software or just try to recreate the sheet provided by Discgear for your DVD or music CD list. I have purchased two now for movies & plan to get another for music CDs in the future.
1,This product does not work in my phone
5,I needed to run my phone's music to an RCA input on a digital-to-analog converter and this worked.The device I was running it to however was not an amplifier and thus I didn't get the end behaviour that I wanted.The wire seems good though I admit it's a rare case when you should need it.
3,This box is OK. It doesn't work with Comcast's X1 boxes that have the "power saving" function enabled. If you disable that it will work fine. Small no heat dissipation passes HDMI via component.
4,It was a little bit of a pain to get the old battery out but the new one went in easily. It is working well and holding the charge pretty well but could be better.
5,Very high quality material and a rich red (my favorite color) make this an eyecatcher wherever I take it.  I do have a little difficulty sliding the front cover into the slots on the back that serve as a stand.  And the front cover does slip back out on its own sometimes.  I hope this is just due to the newness of the product and will improve over time.  I feel like it is sturdy enough to protect my iPad so I don't worry about taking it along when I need to travel with it.
5,I bought this to switch audio from my TV Computer and Dot and it works great. There are no sound quality issues going through the switch and it's easily operated.  The switch itself can be deceiving as the labels don't exactly coincide with the moving switch which moves very little but I had to label the outputs anyway so I just lined up the label with the desired position.
1,Very cheap and didn’t work at all
4,Ordered the cover and it came on time. Was exactly what I was expecting. Quality of fabric and finish is very good. I like the fact the the Kindle turns off when the cover is closed. Much easier than turning it on and off. Very protective of the Kindle and the stand option works very well.
3,This is a fair enough deal for the price. The case is adequate for protecting the tablet but it has a bit of a cheap feel to it. And I'm not a big fan of the tab on the back for propping up the tablet in landscape mode. The cover tends to slip out of the tab if you try to reposition the tablet.
1,They were both staticky
4,Very good case for the price. Functional and aesthetically pleasing. Plus the front flap/magnet that activates the screen works great. It's not perfect however the first viewing angle/resting position for this case always needs a little help so you'll usually need to prop it up and it could use a spot for a stylus. (personal preference)
1,I purchase these headphones because of so many fives star  reviews. Turns out the reviews are not actually for this item. They stopped working very soon after I started using them. The sound quality was off
5,Im glad I sprung for a brand that I know> I love burning stuff to blu ray and these disks were the first ones that I used. My only warning is that you shouldn't let your computer format the disk unless you are going to use it for data. If you want to do a blu ray movie though I suggest using Sothink HD movie maker it's a great piece of software that gives great results . Google it and you should be able to find it. But I digress. These disks work great with my blu ray burner. And I would suggest them to anybody.
4,It’s what I expected from this product it works well
2,According to description it should charge the max capacity battery in 2.5 hours. But it take way more than that. I think it's close to 5 hours.
3,It seems this is more than just a cover for Kindle Fire and I thought there would be some info (plus instructions) sent with it. How does the sleep/wake feature work? Does the magnet cause the battery to run down more quickly?   CaseCrown Bold Standby Case (Black) for Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Inch (Built-in magnet for sleep / wake feature)
5,awesome reviews dont make justice just try it
1,Neither worked out of both ear buds. One would randomly just shut off. Poor quality all the way around. What a waste of money! 🤬
5,Charges my Sony A6600 battery with no problem at all at an awesome price.
4,Works great however We can’t seem to get the Shaw Bluesky remote to be recognized by our Slingbox. Does anyone have some suggestions? Thanks
1,I didn’t need them right away soo I didn’t even try them out. Just assumed they’d work. Neither pair works. Passed the return date. Waste of $
5,They kind of price gouge us don't they? But it is a supply and demand thing I am sure. I needed this because the one that came with my main board broke. Wish they would give me another (or a lower price) for my other m.2 slot but if there are dollars to be made they are going to do it. Props to Amazon for getting it out to me quickly.
1,Keeps discounting. Never had a headphone that won't connect to the phone before.you have to keep trying to pair it with your iPhone
5,Small charger is all I needed and this does the job.  I didn’t want a dual battery charger and like that this plugs directly into the wall vs usb.  Works well so far.
3,But if you could care less about having the newest most expensive holder to show your friends Chris might be one you might want to look at.for $15.00 it does a good job.I used my black shoe dye and recovered the blue suede interior and that completly changed the looks for the better.it fits well didn't cost much and so I like!!!
5,While I should deduct a star for the ultra horrible tubes included with this unit with replacement tubes this is a sublime amp.  Out of the box there was a horrible hum in the left channel and the sound was "frizzy".  Luckily I had already bought both Zenith and RCA tubes on eBay...dropped the US made tubes in and the hum and "frizziness" was gone!  I am using this with Senn HD800...the pair has definitely been a good match for my ears.  Very happy!
3,The only reason I did not use this product is because it did not end up working with my computer. We figured out how to hook our netflix up to our Wii and that works way better than using the cord. I didn't pay enough for it to send it back. If it works for you I think its a great purchase.
5,Pleased to find such a good price for this quality TV mount. Fraction of the price for what the local stores wanted. Installation was straight forward and all the parts were labeled and referenced in the instructions. The only downside is like most instructions theses days and that is poor spelling and grammar giving you a few moments of guessing what they are talking about. I'd buy this again if and when we add another TV in the home.
3,I ordered one of these video adapters for my laptop and it did not work. Fair Top responded immediately and credited my account with the purchase price. we cant know if a product will work or not but their excellent customer service takes the worry out of buying.  Knowing that they will help is worth more than the product price.
5,I was trying to connect a Hauppauge HDR to my friends Cox cable box but he did not have component outputs on his cable box.  I have tried a few other HDMI pass-through devices in the past for similar applications but this is the first one I have found that actually works.  It is small and inexpensive and also only a USB cable is required for power.
4,I love this case in the red. It came with a foam liner but you can't use it because it covers the camera lense and the case is too tight then. I would recommend the case without the foam. The price is fair also.
4,This was easy to install but I didn't like hoe it is only held in by Velcro.  Other than that it works for me and I use my iPad daily.  So far the durability has been great.
1,Not sure what the issue is. They make a beep but that's all.
5,Worked on first setup with Slingbox. One of kind hdmi AND component out....no other adapter does that that I could find. Cable boxes and everything thing else really ditching component output so need hdmi to component converter for slingbox. This does that and has hdmi output for 1 wire going to tv. My hdmi component converter finally broke after 2 years and this is finally on amazon so scooped up!
4,I'm not sure how to review a cable. These work fine and there is no weird noises that come from my subwoofer that they are connected too. The shipped and came quickly. They look very nice like a professional pair of cables. Actually don't mind them not being hidden because they cosmetically look good.
5,This device worked exactly as advertised and was simple to install. I had to change my xfinity dark and no longer had component output for my sling box. This was the only product I could find that had both component and HDMI output. I did think it was a bit expensive but there were no other choices.
1,The right ear bud on one pair already stopped working! Didn’t even last two months!
4,pros:this is a nice case and looks good too. love the HDMI and screen protector. good quality screen protector. my kid scratched it with a pen and screen protector did it's job wonderfully.cons:the pen it's not that good quality but can't complaint since it was cheap overall. haven't tried the headphones.
1,I received one that was broken. I really wanted to enjoy the slingbox but the experience overall was pretty horrible. It started with being told I needed to buy this converter in order to get a good picture on my other TVs. The slingbox is $300. The last thing I wanted to do was spend another $80 on a converter to get to work properly.  Anyway I spent the extra money for the converter and after half a day with slingbox customer service it was determined the converter was faulty. I should have know by the way it looked in the box. I returned this converter and now they’re out of stock.  I plan to return my slingbox 500 now as I have no idea when they will restock and his is just too much with after spending almost $400.
5,This case is very sturdy and works great. I got the red one and it is a nice dark red.  The case leaves enough openings for the switch and buttons.  The verge edges of the screen are sometimes a bit difficult to access but the protection you have is worth it.  I've dropped this thing so many times and I'm not worried (as long as I got this case).
5,I received the DarkVoice 336SE tube headphone amp from Amazon on March 1st 2018.. I’m still using the stock tubes it came with and don’t feel the need to replace them at this time. This amp runs quiet and sounds wonderful with my Beyerdynamic T1.2 headphones. This combo brought my headphone listening to a whole new level... So far I’m very happy with my purchase..
5,The review seems said there will be 1 hour using life after fully charged. But I only have 30 minutes.
3,Nice sturdy quality materials.  One of the adjustable slats on the back does not properly balance  to stand the IPad up on a slant so only one slot is truly useable.  Also the handle/carrying strap is on the INSIDE of the case.  So it seems as if it has no purpose. The magnetic closures are handy.
1,they sound like white noise speakers
1,Lots of static sound.
1,Just buy good ones! These dont even last a week
1,This product does not work
3,It's a very good price the moment you put it on your ipad it already feels cheap. It makes the screen feel rough its easy to get air bubbles and gets ugly scratches really fast. My advice is to just use it as a backup maybe or aurally spend a few more cash to pay for a better screen protector.
4,Got it at a major discount but this is my second one...first one much more $.  Liked it enough to get a "spare" as both I and my daughter have 8.9 KF HD and figure one or the other of us will mess a case up!  Arrived a day early too!
1,If I could rate a 0 I would. Don’t waste your time/money buying these. Terrible quality. Asking me to “connect baets” but they’re wired and plugged in. Keeps making a pinging noise.
1,Sound quality goes bad after a couple of uses!! Volume keeps dropping while I using it.
1,They are crap
3,The outside is attractive finish and the auto on and off feature is nice.  The positioning and overall support of the case is not as good as I had expected.  Wish I had opted for a sturdier product but it is okay for the price.  It arrived in good condition and on time as promised.
1,Don’t waste your money!! These are horrible. They won’t work with new iPhones at all and act like they will work with older phones but then glitch. Total junk.
5,Buy it!  This is my very first headphone amplifier I was not certain that the amp made any difference but I was 100% blown away.  For high-impedance headphones such as the Sennheiser HD 800 or Beyerdynamic T1.2 it's hard to imagine anything sounding better.  As many people recommended I upgraded the tubes with ones found on eBay (you can see many recommendations here).
1,The idea is to plug my Apple TV OPPO disc player laser disc player and VCR (I have analog to HDMI converters. Works fine when jacked straight into the tuner/amp.) into the gadget with outputs to flat screen and projector by HDMI OUT ports. HDMI OUT 2 works fine. HDMI OUT 1 does nothing. After multiple emails with support tech Jessica  at EZCOO the problem is unresolved. I am waiting for either a fix or a swap for a fully functional device.If it worked this is what I need. This does not work.
1,My phone makes an sound when I plug in the cable but the sound does not work.
5,Let me start off by saying this is an awesome case. I got one for my mom (red) and another for my dad (blue) for Christmas. I was kind of skeptical when purchasing because I didn't want to give them some poorly made case to go with their new iPads that I got them.PROS:•Can manipulate the case to sit several different ways•Made of good material (feels like it will be long-lasting)•Colors are beautiful and just as picturedCONS:•Haven't found any yet but will update if things change
4,Standoff is too small diameter to fit into an MSI motherboard M.2 Standoff hole
4,I was looking for a cable to connect my turntable (pre-amp output) to my PC to record a bunch of LP's. This cable seems decent quality at a reasonable price connectors are good quality and tight fit without being impossible to remove. Bottom line it works and did the job for me. Not exactly audiophile grade but what audiophile in their right mind would want a 25 foot interconnect!
4,As another reviewer mentioned the sound is somewhat dissapointing. Otherwise it works well.
1,Only works with Bluetooth on! It's a wired headphone.. don't buy apple products! If u do only buy apple manufactured accessories. I hate apple iPhone.
2,If you need more that 5-6 inches in length then this is not useful at all. The only way this works is if the PCI-E card is right next to the power source which is very unlikely.I fail to see the utility of this cable and I missed to check the length thinking that any reasonable product will have a reasonable length. You need at least 15 inches for reasonable use.
1,I do not like them
1,No se escuchan bien
1,They are Bluetooth for no reason and make random beeping sounds. Also broken within 2 months
5,This is the second case I bought the first one I bought 3 1/2 years ago  (price then was $5.50) and it served me very well. The only reason I purchased a new one is that the cover is beginning to peel at the fold.  Definitely got my moneys worth.  The Kindle fits in perfectly and all buttons are easily accessible.
5,This thing was a life saver! I just got the new Fios One boxes and this adapter allowed me to continue to use my slingbox M2. We use our slingbox a lot so I’m glad we found it!
1,It took less than a week for both pairs to break
4,Very good finish.  I have used it for only one month so I cannot vouch for durability although it feels as if it's going to last. A good value overall.
5,You can get multiple devices to do what this one device does.  It works and is worth the expenditure.  Perfect for our particular need.
4,Overall a good cable. I gave this 4 stars and not 5 since the adaptor is double male which makes it usless if you have a male already going to the speakers.  This adapter should have been male on one end and female on the other.
3,I paid 12$ for it that is bit toooo much! It does the job no problems with that but price is ridiculous!
5,I bought the HDMI component converter / adapter because the newer TV's don't have analog plug ins. The HDMI component converter worked perfectly. However!!!! It would be really nice if Slingbox would update their boxes to HDMI plug ins and now it's one more thing I have to plug into power to work!
4,It does what it was designed for with excellent picture quality.
4,This case would of been perfect but there were no holes for the power botton or the camera.  So a little disappointed in that but I think my fault for not reading up on it to make sure that it came with it in the first place.  Thanks
5,Shipping was lightning fast the cover is even better than I expected does a great job protecting the ipad air. Super easy to slip into place and is very secure the fold over velco tab holds it tight. The microfiber lining is super soft and won't worry at all about the glass not being protected. This adds very little weight. Wake/sleep works perfectly as does using it in a stand position.  I bought the red case and it is a wonderful bright color. The cost is a bargain for the quality of the case.
1,You have to connect these via Bluetooth every time you plug them in. Not convenient poor quality one earbud didn’t work out of package.
2,Did not fit on my I-Pad 2. It was off center no matter how I tried to fix it. If it wasn't the front facing camera that was partially covered it was the home button. Did not look right. The only part of this that was useful was the microfiber cleaning cloth. It takes some of the finger prints off the actual I-Pad screen. I threw the protector out though. Thank God it was only $3. The 2 stars in my review are for the cloth. If it didn't come with the cloth Then unfortunately it would be a 1 star rating.
5,I bought this little guy for 46 cents four years ago and sadly had to put him away yesterday after buying my first HD TV. It still works perfectly but is no longer needed in an HDMI world. Used with a VGA to video converter ($12) I was able to connect my laptop to an elderly SD TV. Some of the best and smartest money I've ever spent on Amazon. You'll be missed little buddy.I'm a little frustrated at the negative reviews here. Please do a little research before blaming the product.
5,10/10 Works with B350 TOMAHAWK ARCTIC. Needed this because I lost my Mobo included screw but had the standoff. This entire standoff and mount screw set fit firmly and works with my intel 660p. Thank you! Came quick and in the mail the next day!
1,I this product for me and my sister and it came in like this worst product ever
1,Uno de los auriculares porque venían dos no funcionó bien. Se subía y bajaba el volumen y cuando quería bajarlo tomaba una captura de pantalla 🙄 lamentablemente tengo que devolverlos
4,I wanted a simple case for my kindle fire without dropping $50 and this was perfect. It's easy to use and doesn't diminish the sound at all that I can tell. There is a bit of a smell to it at first but it went away in a couple days.
1,People hear weird sounds when I’m the line with me. Throwing them in the trash since I missed it by one day to return this trash
4,It's of course overpriced. But it does what it is intended to do.
3,Had to return because was wrong size but I liked it and if I ever get an 8.9 inch Fire this is the case I'll get.
1,These earbuds have a constant crackling sound. Music does not sound well with these earbuds. They have a tinny sound and not realistic.
3,It works but it's over priced. I was a little annoyed that it was not magnetic as it would have made it easier to install.
5,I DO LIKE AMAZON'S CASE A LOT MORE.  However the price is too rich for my blood.  With that out of the way let me say that this case fits perfectly and I recommend anyone looking for a good and inexcpensive case for their Kindle Fire 8.9 take a good look at this as an option.the fit is great and the magnetic closure works great (it turn the device on\off) by protecting the display and for power manegment.I've had this case for a couple of weeks and it still looks new.
5,Recently replaced my Legacy FiOS Set-top-box with a new FiOS TV One box.  Works perfectly with my Slingbox Pro HD.  Simple set up and configuration.  If you have a Slingbox Pro HD and a Set top box with only a HDMI output buy this!  It works!
5,The battery fits right and works fine. Got it installed in no time. It was a great buy at that price
4,Very light yet appears to give good protection.  I haven't used it long enough to really give a solid review on how it will hold up but am certainly pleased so far.
2,I haven't had this but maybe a couple of weeks and the metal sleeve over the female end fell off. It is threaded and screws onto plastic. One of the two is the wrong size. The threads simply don't mesh so it just falls off.It'll still function maybe I'll glue it?You get what you pay for.  Caveat Emptor!
5,Initially gave this 3 stars because it wasn't working with my Schiit Modi 2 until I realized I was inputting an analog signal into my DAC... So it's not a bad cable and it's well built from what I can tell.
1,These earbuds arrived quickly but are not compatible with the Apple iPhones and should not be advertised as so.
4,The items are pretty good the earphone are not good for skype video chat but not good if you use to listen to mp3 musics.The screen is good be sure to set it right on the screen. I will recomend these items for low budget customers.Shipping is good too.
5,This case was exactly as I expected it would be.  IF I had to put a con it would be that when you open it and fold it back there’s no magnet to hold the cover back like with all my other cases so I have to hold it.  But I still enjoy this very much.
3,It didn't arrive in the best condition which made it even harder to apply.  Once done I was never able to fully get it very smooth.  I have left it on though because my small daughter uses this often.  I will change it when it gets used more.  It hasn't peeled just bubbles.
1,I wanted wired ear buds these are wired blue tooth.
5,I got this almost 5 years ago and I’m just now writing a review. Still up and never had any problems
5,This item delivered everything promised.  I have a Slingbox 500 and recently upgraded to my providers newest set top cable box which has HDMI only no component jacks..  This device allowed me to connect my Slingbox the new cable box.  No hassles.  I just reset the Slingbox and went through the setup process.
1,Both stopped working within a month
4,Much better than the one I purchased from Apple.  This case provides protection for my IPad Air;however this case is not as good as the one offered by Amazon for the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  The case for my Kindle fire HDX is superior.
1,Headphones sound fine but cheap quality. After 5 weeks of intermittent use break easily.
1,Broke with in 5 minutes
3,Hung the bracket according to the level that is on the bracket and it was a good one inch off.  Had to remove drill new holes and and rehang using my reliable level.  Then it was perfect.  Would have given five stars had the level worked!  USE YOUR OWN LEVEL.
5,This thing is awesome. I've heard it before from a buddy and it's great. Bought one came with a faulty tube but I have no issue in that! Waiting for new one in mail. But the exact one my buddy has sounds fantastic. I will claim the same for mine.
1,Plugged them into my iPhone. Music continues to play out of phone speaker with nothing coming through the earbuds.
5,This iPad case is excellent! I bought this same case over 4 1/2 years ago and I just replaced it with the exact same case again. A flaw with the older design a narrow and fragile section of the case which went underneath the home button has now been omitted and the case is even better than before.
5,best investment I have ever made. before I was only carrying my nook around in the case I bought it in to preotect it now I use this leather case and so far it seems to be doing a good job. and it also takes up a lot less space while still being eye catching so I remember exactly where I placed it. I absolutely love it. I just wish they had more choices of design like superhero covers and things along those lines for the same great price i bought this one at
3,The previous ones I ordered were faux leather (Vinyl no doub) padded and looked stylish; and the lid opened slowly and smoothly when released.  . The new one is just hard plastic and the lid flys open.  Perhaps I ordered a lower end model by accident but it is non what I was expecting.
3,works with Cincinnati fioptics and sling box.had to send the first one back"it worked for 5 days"hope this one keeps on ticking.
5,I got myself 2 of these bad boys. 1 for a 42 inch and 1 for a 46 inch. I dare you to find this type of bracket elsewhere that tilts up and down anywhere near this price range you will not. The instructions specify pilot holes and screw sizes im millimeters which might complicate installation. To save you some time I used a 3/8 drill bit in place of the 10mm recommended for the anchors. Lightly hammer them in and use a 1/2" socket to tighten the lag screws into the anchors.
5,This is a great little case.  It was a good bargain and it fits really well.  It a bit flimsy on the fold when its standing its the most upright position.  You have to adjust it so the extra material is folded properly or it becomes off balance.  Also the tuck tab in the back can be tricky if you say wanted to do this with one hand its not possible.  I can't complain for the price though and I'd have no issue ordering another when this one becomes worn.
3,The package is complete with all the items offered but the case does not fit well enough. I can't use the both cameras because that.However the case has a a good style and give protection to my Acer tablet A100. Moreover all the items work properly.To sum up the price hardly suits the product quality.
4,Worksd like a champ to convert incoming BNC color video to VGA video for our computer monitor.  Instructions could be a little better but we figured it out pretty easily and are happy.
1,It never put any signal through either the s-video or composite video side of this. Was trying to use this for my laptop with karaoke and Video Jockey software to connect the VGA output of my laptop to the composite or s-video input of my video projector or another video monitor. I have everything set up correctly on my computer for the dual display and it works when I connect a regular VGA to VGA cable but always a blank screen when using this adapter And yes I have the correct input selected on the projector and/or monitor. If you are looking for something to output your DJ/KJ/VJ rigs display screens this is not the item that will work for you. But on a tight budget it was worth a try for only a couple of bucks. No big loss.
1,They skipped when my son used them
4,Was able to get these to work but only sent out B/W picture quality.  For what we were using them for it was fine but wasn't what I was expecting.
4,I would give 5 stars if not for the high price. It is exactly what i needed. Fast shipper.
3,This item will not convert between formats for that you need a actually box type converter with other components. If you think this will do a direct conversion then just like me you got it wrong do not buy if you are looking for a vga/rbg converter.
4,Husband purchased this case at a real bargain price! He really likes it! Stands well and fits great with room to plug in all the accessories. Quality is fair...does not have the look or feel of real leather but for the price it was a great deal!
5,As far as wall mounts go they're pretty simple devices and they do a pretty straighforward job.  This one was easy to install* and the built in level made it that much easier.  It appears to be doing it's job as my TV was still on the wall this morning when I left for work.  As long as the TV stays on the wall it will get all 5 stars from me.*You do need to have a drill set and either a ratchet or hex drill bit for installation.
1,The sound is difficult to manage pressing the side bar works only sometimes ear buds themselves feel strange. Don’t waste your money.
5,Yes I purchased this for my kindle 8.9" and was very pleased at the overall fit and quality of this item! It has a very nice rich look and feel to it unlike some of the ones that feel cheaply made! So yes I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to purchase one in the same or like that is if it is made by the same company! Thanks again Amazon for the quality service and purchase!!!
1,You certainly get what you pay for with this one. I put it on my iPad and not only was it significantly smaller than the screen but when I put it on it was completely filled with streaks that looked like when you see a layer of oil on top of water. It looked so horrendous that I just took it off and threw it away because I knew it would never work. Never mind the fact that it was shipped in a paper envelope so it got bent at the corners which would have ruined it even if it had looked okay when applied. Honestly spend a little more and get a protector that will (hopefully) be shipped properly and will not look like total crap when it's applied. I'm more mad at myself for buying this I should have known better but I thought I was getting a good deal.
5,Wanted to connect security camera for front entry to a monitor in the Office Managers office.Works great just what I needed.
5,Great organizer for traveling with several pieces of computer smartphone tablet and kindle cords. I am able to keep everything in one spot without taking up valuable luggage space. I also use this in the car for road trips to ensure everything makes it back home and is accessible for everyone while on the road. Great product!
5,This helped me upgrade from an old AMD 5770 to an RTX 2060. The psu has two 6 pin connectors on the same line and this allowed me to convert to a single 8 pin and it drives a pretty significant overclock! Getting 144hz in 1080p ultrawide games now.
4,This case is not bad. It's a good quality case and protects the Kindle. However it's a bit pricy on here as I see it on eBay for $5. I would return it to get back my money but it's too much stress for extra $10.
5,This battery has exceeded my expectations. I would order another one if needed
5,Had trouble with my Slingbox working on Charter TV cable box with Selectable Output Control (SOC) software installed.  SOC software allows only HDMI output from the Charter cable box and Slingbox requires component input.  This converter did the trick by converting HDMI input to Component output to my Slingbox and it is once again working great!
2,I'm a Audio video installer..12 yrs.. I purchased 2 of these for a job and neither would work on a suddenlink box.. blinking in and out..and then no signal..i tried on a dvd player same thing..luckily I had some 25 ft hdmi ( another brand ..thicker gauge) and worked as soon as I plugged them up..maybe it was just a bad set but for 2 of them to have the same issue..i wouldn't try again
1,Would give a 0 outta 5
4,Product added what I needed to boost the signal.
5,I would like to say that this has a elegant design and robust protection to my iPad Air. The mounting stand fits well and stands perfect. I am glad to have this amazing case for optimal price. Unlike the most of the cases where you need to struggle to fit your iPad exactly into the case siz this being overcome here by just placing the iPad under a strap and close the iPad with the strap like you do with a watch or any devices which fit on our body using strap.
1,After the VGA port of my TV went bad I looked for a solution to get the video from my computer to the television via VGA connection from my computer to the  S-Video connection on the TV. This product promised it would do just that. After connecting it to both I got nothin'! And I do mean nothing. I don't know if the product is just worthless or if I missed something because no mater what I've tried this product DOES NOT WORK. And mailing it back would be a waste of time as the postage would have cost more than the actual product itself. Waste of my time and money...
5,Just follow the graphic and connect as shown.  The only thing the graphic does not convey is you must reconfigure your Slingbox app to a component connection.  You do that in the Settings menu in the Slingbox app.
4,Easy to install but comcast keeps blocking the signal.Found a way to trick it hope it lasts.
4,Up rite screw for mu M.2 wish I didnt have to spend an arm and leg to get
3,I'm giving three stars because the cover was very nice for the money.  The problem I had was the smell.  I returned it because I knew the smell would bother me.  It was a faint odor and it might not bother someone else.  I'm sensitive to smells.
5,Worked like a charm to replace the missing stand off and screw for my new memory!
4,I got these and has been working great for hanging over my fireplace but spacing for the bolts is not ideal when mounting on stubs. I had to get special brackets to attach mount to the wall but all and all I am happy.
5,I have not tried out dropping my iPad Air with this case on but I figured I should buy it in case you never know when it might drop or fall and hopefully the corners will hold up.The red is a little on the lighter side I would of liked a deeper red color and the case had a weird chemical smell for about 2 weeks which made me want to always wash my hands after touching it but over all I am happy with this product :)
5,This is a large case I was looking for to carry all the cables for family outings.  Another one I had purchased did not have enough pockets but this one if full of space for cables and chargers.  As a bonus there is a pocket large enough to carry my daughters ipad mini.
4,I am very happy with this case love the color!  The quality is good and I think it will serve me well.  The standup feature was a little too erect to suit me at first but I have adjusted just fine.
2,This product was a big disapointment. The product itself was bent but the envelope shipped in wasnt which tells me it was bent prior to being placed in package. The tabs thatbyou pull off to help you separate the film tore off and the film itself was hard to pull off. Once I finally pulled off the bottom piece and applied the screen protector I pulled off the top protection film and it pulled the whole screen protector off! Shipping was decent product is not reccomended
2,The problem with the case is the support for the stand up does not work well at all.  When you are watching a movie or reading you have to constantly stuff the back tab into the slot as it falls down. Very irritating. The stars are because the rest of the case seems to be well made I thought it was auto shut off when you closed it and it isn't but that maybe my fault and read it wrong.  Color is true to the picture I got red.
4,I have seen some bad reviews on this cable but it seems to work just fine with my ps3 and tv no problems what so ever. Its not the cable i wanted but hey when you don't have the money to buy more expensive items go cheep.
2,After reading other users' comment I thought it could be used as a coaxial SPDIF cable for an old FIIO X3 DAP tested on 2 different DAC but none of them could find it.
5,I have liked this case from the beginning and was afraid I couldn't find a new one for my older kindle fire. I looked all over and was so happy to find this one. It fits my older tablet just fine. I hope it's still around when I need another one.
4,it's the second one I've bought. I  know my screen would have been broken at least a dozen times without the case.
4,The Case was perfect fit for the Kindle. Like the feature that closing the case turns off the Kindle and opening it turns it back on. The  thing did not like was the stand which is made very cheap and difficult to engage.
5,Love it
1,False advertisement. Couldn’t use for phone calls
5,My first CaseCrown case lasted about 3 years and I just ordered a replacement without even looking for anything different. This case is simple and nice looking. The magnetic "off" feature is very handy as is the little strap on the inside cover which helps prevent accidental dropping. It's super easy to get the iPad in and out. A great price for a great product!
2,Not easy to use and nothing like a case I had for previous ipad.  It takes two hands to even prop it up and doesn't feel that substantial.  And it is limited in how you can configure it.  My old case I could open and set up with one hand.  This one you have to manually slip the cover into one of the two slots on the back and there is nothing to secure it and they feel flimsy and it just doesn't support the ipad very well.
3,I paid $1 so how bad can it be?  It was late - it took over a month to arrive and it is flimsy.  It was not packaged in any type of cardboard backing so it was creased when it was put in my mailbox.  But again $1...
2,I got this as a gift and it's failed on the second uncorking. I do not recommend this product!
4,Has slots for papers or business cards easy to hold with elastic hand wrap.  Would have given 5 stars but all of these cases open backwards as opposed to a book opening but for under eleven dollars a great buy.  I recommend.
1,Useless.  Each pair worked for about 2 days
5,I have had my kindle for a long time now (since 2013) and use it every day.  This is the third case I've ordered and I'm glad I could still get one.  It is a great case at a great price and I would highly recommend it.
3,It didn't work.  There was a fuzzy picture but no sound.
2,price for this protector dropped since i bought it last month but i wouldnt spend 1 dollar on this thing ive put on alot of protectors and none have been as bad as this product.  i recieved it without a package or envelope it was just in the box with other stuff so the product was bent before placing it didnt return it cuz i needed atleast some protection for christmas day. so i would recommend this item again
4,Makes the whole thing a bit heavy and bulky after inserting the drive and cable; but the support is supposedly great!
5,Very good case for the 8.9" Kindle HD tablet. It is inexpensive and not leather but unless you feel you need something more luxurious this does the trick. Has an opening in the border for the camera lens and all buttons/connection points are readily accessible. I bought the black this time for someone I bought the Kindle for because I had bought the dark blue for myself a while. I would buy this case again if I needed something basic but functional.
1,They did not work at all!
4,The leather case fits the A100 perfectly however the stand only offers one viewing angle.  This package is a bargain when you consider all that is included in this package I can live with the limited viewing angle.Bottom Line: I would buy again
5,MIX AND MATCH PLUG AND PLAY CABLES TO VARIOUS CONNECTION NEEDS AND APPLICATIONS WITH MINIMAL SIGNAL LOSS
2,Be careful with what this mounting bracket online info says"will fit" these model numbers. The right mounting screws were NOT included in the package. I made two trips to the hardware store to get the right size and the right thread. $4.00 and the gas spent I finally got it to work This did not account for the three plus hours making it work. Once up it seems to be just OK nothing special about it.
5,For the cost of all these items I would say its a pretty good deal considering what you get for it case does exactly the job fits ok cable is a great addition and the pen and the headset I don't really care for as far as the screen protector I think it also serves it's purpose well you just have to really get those air bubbles out overall great deal! I recommend if you don't want to spend alot of money on a case
2,Not in use I have doubts that I ever will.  I really believed that I was purchasing a device to boost my signal turns out this will only amplify what you have to other devices.  I should have sent it back when I found that out but got distracted trying to resolve the problem.
1,La cálida es pésima solo por un día me sirvieron
5,I used this cable to connect my projector to my sound system. We wanted to hear the projector delivered sounds over our sounds sounds. Works great. Glad Amazon had this unique cable available to do so.
5,I bought a couple of these kind of carelessly without reading the description for a couple of new 4TB Passports - my bad.  These are a little thin for them meant for older lower capacity models but I can get it closed.  Seems well enough made for the price and what it does.
5,Waited to review this until it was in the boat all season.  Never had a mishap with.  Mounted to the helm and all wires ran behind it out of the weather.  But it held up fine being on the water for five months
5,Ordered sound bar because it accepted coaxial audio which is only option for my TV. Would have been nice if cable would have been included. This cable was exactly what I needed.
4,For the price I think this is a good cover.  It has two tabs on back to allow for two different viewing angles.  Protects very well puts screen to sleep when cover is closed..wakes up with cover is opened.
3,Adapter itself worked however I was trying to make my laptop play on my Sony Bravia TV and while I had a VGA port the graphic card or something did not allow for displaying on a TV so it didn't work for me but not the cable's fault.
5,I love my new i pad air case it does protect the corners really nice ! And fits my iPad nicely for sitting in your hands while your doing things on it..I had another covering that was flimsy and wore out really fast in just a very short time..I also like the way it's sits up to work on too. Joanne
4,This is a solid product. It's easy to apply and it stays on! It is crystal clear and prints whips off with ease.  I have recommended this product to friends and would buy thus again if I ever had too.  Buy with confidence.
3,Acer iconia A100 tablet fits good enough in the case.Screen film is the right size.HDMI cable works but controlling the tablet when connected to a TV set is a real challenge.Earbuds and stylus are simple but can be used at least to save the day.
1,Device that plugs in to phone fell off after two days' use. Returned.
5,Love it my thick wide 5TB portable hard drive fits just right. Perfect amount of cushion padding and enough compartments for cable cards etc... I would love if they had a bigger size but this one works perfectly. This is just right in size. I love it and would definitely buy it again.
5,Used Boltlink cables to REPLACE HDMI cables in a conference room AV system installed about 2 years ago.  Client was experiencing bad video quality or no communications with newer computers.  These cables fixed the problem: no more video quality issues no more HDMI/computer link-up problems.Great product fast delivery...made us look good!
3,Cable looks and feels good but am returning as it is just not practical to wiggle the hdmi connection to make it work.  I have another hdmi cable I use to confirm it was the cable.
3,I have an HP 2000 laptop. I wanted to put the display from my laptop onto my old analog TV. I read the reviews and was not sure if this cable would work with my laptop. It did not work but for $2 it was worth a try.
5,This is my 6th Discgear product.  I have  2 of their 20ct travel containers and this is my 4th stackable organizer. Also have given them as gifts which were greatly appreciated.  It takes awhile to get everything numbered and labeled but once done you end up with so much more space and practical organization.  With a glance you can see exactly what you have and where every CD/DVD can be located.  Would be lost without this system.
3,I guess my  ipad is  1 inch wider. The color is great and great quality..
4,iPad secured in place can't slip out.  Easel back functional.  Nothing fancy just practical. Definitely recommend.  If you sling your iPad around a lot you may want something that stays closed by more than just a light magnet.
2,Not a very high quality screen protector. First of all it only comes with one screen protector so if you mess up you don't have a second or even third chance. Also the poor quality makes it virtually impossible to not have any bubbles. Took a while to ship. Go with a higher quality protector. Don't worry about the price if it is higher because that's the price that will get you something good.
3,Could be the program i am using but it felt i would write then it crap out and it was only with these bd-r too so yaa they get a 50%percent since they work 50% of the time and they where cheap too...
5,I love this case. It does everything I need it to. I really like the "sleep" feature of this case which others I looked at did not even have. The only thing bad I could say about it is it occasionally is difficult to get it to standup but then I am sure as I get it broken in and get used to it that will no longer be a problem. All in all a great case at a great price.
5,What I needed to keep my sling box M1 working when I changed cable companies and the new box didn’t have the same connections as the other company.
5,Very durable and great sound quality.
1,They simply stopped working. Both pairs worked for a few minutes then zero sound. Please AVIOD
2,the product on it's own is fine. the price is great.unfortunately it was sent in a simple manila envelope which had been bent every which way by the time it ended up FOLDED in my post office box. this led to kinks in the product itself which stayed visible after being applied to the iPad.need to work on the packaging. or just leave this product for in store purchases.
4,This is a great case.  The only thing I noticed is that over time it does tend to get dirty and turn black where the top flap closes over the screen.  Other than that it's a great case.
5,Slingbox users will know that Component Video input is needed in addition to HDMI; if your cable box (or other source) has only HDMI output you need one of these... and mine worked just fine.
5,Purchased this along with the 8.9" Amazon KF HD for my son. He loves both of them. II fought I was just purchasing a case but the really cool thing about this case is there are a couple of magnets inside the case so when you close the case it not only keeps case closed it puts the Kindle in "sleep" mode until you open the case a lot less wear and tear on battery over the life of Kindle I'm sure.
1,When I ordered this I thought that it was the right size for my Kindle Fire 8.  It was too big and it was the only one that I seen for the tablet.  I would not have sent it back if I did not think that I would get a complet refurn or one that would fit.  I did order 2 at the time and sent them both back thanking that I would get the full refurn  That will not be happening.  Out of paying $10 apiece I am only going to get back $8 UNSTADE OF THE $20 THAT I SHOULD BE GETTING.  I AM NOT HAPPY AT ALL.
5,Item works as advertised.  This small charger seems to get the job done without the use of long proprietary cords or bulky Sony charger.  easy to carry and store.
3,Good support team~! Unfortunatly for me this item didnt work! Maybe it got damaged in the mail but hey for the price it was worth a shot! I Wasnt hoping for much but a grainy picture but yeah.. anyway just thought i should leave my feedback.
3,Its good but have to maneuver around the case on the screen to work features when working in landscape. This is the only way I work.
5,Absolutely love the color and fit for the iPad Air. I've used it in all the positions and the strap for your hand as well. Each one is comfortable and makes for easy usage of the device. I would most definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a case!!! Thank you so much for such a great product! And a side note I am very picky when it comes to cases for any of my electronics!!!
4,Seriously.  Look at the case.  Now look at the price.  Now look at the case again.  You're welcome.Bought this one for my husband.  I already have one for my smaller Kindle.  No complaints.
1,Too late to return. They didn’t work.
5,Bought this to use with my Slingbox set-up.  Very pricy but it does the job and couldn't find anything to compete with it at any price so can't complain.  Worked out-of-the-box with easy setup and operation.
4,It fits my iPad perfect. I have one complaint and I guess I should blame the mailman. It has a bend right in the middle of it and I can't get it smoothed out. Other than that I have no complaints.
5,This worked great for a few months but then it stopped working.  I e-mailed the seller and they sent me a new one without me needing to return the old one. Outstanding customer service!
5,This device works perfectly for me.  I am now able to use my Slingbox 500 again after switching to TiVo last year.  I use it with my TiVo Mini in my office.  Easy set up.  I love it!
3,This Is My 2nd One But It Still Didn't Work Just Fuzz Shows Up When I Use It And I Know It's Not A Problem With My Laptop Nor My TV But I Guess You Cant Expect A Good Cable for a Good Price.
3,The screen protector was way to big. The cover was made for front & rear cameras needless to say it did not fit the case  to charge it up I have to remove it from the case  But the cables work great
4,The iPad Case (Corner Protection) case is great only one complaint. I wish it could stand up in the upright position with a stand.  Other than that is nice.
4,Once i used double sided tape to get it on the wall i found it to be very easy to switch from the 3 inputs.
5,Nice and compact for travel and packing.I like the graph on the side with the estimated charging time.Does the job well so that works for me.
5,Case fits ipad air perfectly.  Corners are protected.  Magnetic latch is strong and works great.  Finish is good.  Only concern is the previously mentioned strong smell that seems to be going away with age.  I have been using this case for two weeks.  Shipped quickly and came well packed and in a retail cardboard case.  I have purchased many ipad cases over the years for various models and this is as good as any.
1,I ordered this like many other people despite the bad reviews. The idea for this cable is what makes it the most appealing as well as the price. I mean connecting your computer to your TV for under $5 AFTER shipping and handling? Who can really turn that down?So ordered the product and it got here within about a week which is normal here. I tested the product rather throughly making sure that it wasn't my error. Sure enough I should have listened to the reviews. Therefore I highly recommend that you DO NOT buy this product. It will never work ever.
1,There was a constant static popping noise when my music was playing. Couldnt listen to half of my music. Not good quality.
3,Works like a charm. A massively over price gouged charm.. but hey it does work.
5,Allowed me to hook my tv up to the computer till I upgraded. No complaints from it.
5,Small but powerful...worked out of the box. Only issue is there is NO power supply included so you need to power it separately with a standard USB supply. Box does not get excessively warm either (another plus). Highly recommend and will update down the road if any issues arise.
4,Nice case but doesn’t wear as well as I imagined it would
4,Seems to work fine  bought to solve problem of  voltage spikes destroying splitters. Time will tell i suppose
1,Needed an AUX to lighting cord for my fiancé’s car. Ordered this one and it didn’t work. The part that is supposed to go into the AUX is too short. We also tried it in our speakers and it didn’t work for that either same reasoning. Ended up returning. Not sure if we just received a defective one? But just a warning I would buy a different brand if you want it to actually work and not have to hassle with returns during a pandemic.
5,Excelente artículo. Llegó en perfectas condiciones y súper rápido.
3,Can't seem to figure out how to set-up this case for 45deg. angle viewing.  I don't know if it's in the case correctly or not.  I've tried turning the tablet around but then lose access for the charging and USB connestions.
5,Gives my stain enough power to finish the job
5,got my butt out of a jam.  these work very well and you don't have to worry about short wires these ones fit on the end of your existing 6 pin connection making it an 8.
5,Perfect replacement for the battery in my Samsung TU-530 Tab 4 Tablet. Found replacement instructions on YouTube and were very easy. Only downfall removal took edge wears down quickly. Changed and charged battery as per instructions. Unit works great. Great product for the price.
1,Arrived April 26 and both pairs stopped working by May 15. Garbage! Do not buy!
5,I already had a basic case but wanted something with a little more protection since I haul my IPad everywhere. This is exactly what I was looking for & I absolutely love the fact that it has the ability to stand tall lean back a little & turn around to prop for typing. It's still lightweight and the holes line up perfectly for charging and for headphones. All around great case.
5,I returned these because they wouldn't fit my board. I didn't open it as I could tell they were too small through the package. I five starred for the cute packaging.MSI B450M Gaming Plus
5,One of the pins broke off
1,All I hear is crackling!
5,I bought this hoping to connect a Playstation 2 to a computer monitor with a VGA input. Sadly this will not work because the signal must be CONVERTED if you're trying to go from RCA to VGA. If you're going from VGA to RCA there is no issue and this ADAPTER works fine for that purpose.If you're like me trying to get a RCA signal to a VGA input you need a RCA to VGA CONVERTER NOT an adapter.
3,Cable works just as good as more expensive ones. The only thing i see is these are thin they look like they are not sheilded well but what do you expect for $2. They make a great spare cable.
1,Opened package could tell straight away it was damaged. The right lower hand corner is bent looks like someone tried shoving a too big of an iPad into the case (pictured).On the front of the case it’s splattered with god knows what (pictured).Stitching is frayed in the inside of the top cover (pictured)Divots/dents on front cover (not pictured).The mechanism to stand your iPad up is super cheap and unstable (not pictured)The pencil case is kind of random cheap useless (pictured).May be the worst product I have ever received on Amazon. Wish I could give negative points.
4,Worked OK. Wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.
5,I love this wall mount. It was easy to put up and I LOVE that it allows you just enough space between the TV and the wall in case you have to hook up something else to the TV or anything like that. It tilts perfectly so the TV can be seen by anyone in the room no matter where in the room they are.I will recommend this product to everyone who needs a wall mount.
4,This is a nice case especially for the price. The only drawback is on the black the inside suede looking stuff is gray. I would have liked it better black. Looks like it will hold up as long as the device.
4,Works as advertised instructions could be better.  I connected this to an old Commodore 64.  The video I'd bright and clear.
1,I had chosen this vendor not only because of price but because there were a large number of good reviews. I thought "Maybe it was a fluke these people got a bad cable." After I plugged it in I had a green screen same as before. I brought it to Radio Shack and they ran it on a portable DVD player. It had a very skewed image indicating the cable was bad. I did get a refund very quickly so that is a good thing. Please save yourself some aggravation and spend the money to get a good cable.
4,This case does add significant weight (8.3 oz) to an iPad air but it also provides great protection with the corner wrap. Someone knocked my iPad off of a 4 ft high shelf onto a hard floor and--nothing!
5,The only thing to know is that this fits perfectly into the bizarre little threads on the Asus Rog Strix B350-F motherboard.  Spendy for one little standoff and screw but worth it to get the right part.
5,I was lucky to have selected the Case Crown case for my first IPAD an IPAD2. It proved to be a great value. When I recently bought an IPOD Air I again researched the multitude of available cases and once again the Case Crown case rose to the top of the picks. I have not been disappointed. It is a very functional case that just does its job without being obtrusive or needing any special fussy handling.
1,NEVER PAY MORE THAN ABOUT $3.00 FOR ANY HDMI CABLE!!!  They are all the same.  Buy a package of six and sell them to your neighbors for a 100% profit.  I shudder when I see people paying over $60 for this cable.  They are all the same and they all work the same way.But then there is the strange phenomenon in this country wherein people want you to know how much they paid for their stuff.  And I always say "Gee only $125 for those Nikes?  Why I know a place at the mall you could have paid $19999 for the same shoes."We just do not make sense as consumers.
4,Ive had this for a few years now it fit perfectly and to this day it still doesn't have a scratch on it.
5,Good value for the money plugged in and worked flawlessly.
4,easy install good battery so far
4,The case is just what I expected.  It protects my Kindle keeps it from slipping out of my hands and allows me to prop it up.  The quality is good and can't be beat for the price.
4,No me sirve
5,Excelente
4,What they charge for a piece of plastic is crazy!
4,Just what I needed to protect my Kindle.  Fits snuggly in case.  Other reviews said the camera opening is on the wrong side of case however if you use the stand it is in the correct position.
1,Didn’t work
3,probably if it works but I do not probe it worked with 3 machine and none achieved to take out the image to the TV so I put 3 stars on that page and noticed that depended on the video controller.
3,I've tried using this adapter with my desktop and laptop but neither seems compatible with this adapter. :(  My bedroom still does not have video in it. I might just buy a new TV for my bedroom and run HDMI.
4,Awesome mount for the price and easy install. Nice low profile. Will be getting more for the rest of the house
4,very good with some tube updating.....
5,Purchased my M.2 didn't come with the standoff and everything. This came quick and a perfect fit in my motherboard
5,Dear ConsumerNot bad for it's price. I did have a little problem during application but I think it was my inexperience that trickled the problem. After the screen protector was applied it made my iPad look new. It was great no smudges or finger prints. I love it.PS. It took a while to receive it cause it comes from Hong Kong in snail mail but their customer support is great!
3,I had a lot of trouble getting the air bubbles out of them and figuring out how to get them apart and which to sheet to use at first. The tabs on the sheet were difficult to get removed also.
4,Worked well in getting my Titan Xp up an running.
4,The tablet case met my expectations it also combines into a stand for watching movies or reading. The earphones are superb. The end of the stylus could have been bit narrower. Haven't used the screen protector. I am indeed satisfied.
4,Good case kickstand feature is nice.  Durable enough....though I go through them quickly with an 8 year old...lots of use. Good protection but you really need screen protectors in addition to any case.
1,Constantly says “power on” “connected” in the middle of using them…. listening while headphones are connected it switches to speaker….junk
4,Buen precio y buen convertidor
3,Crazy overpriced but I guess that's supply and demand! Does what it's supposed to.
4,I like it but it doesn’t pretec
1,The threads of the standoff are too narrow to fit into the threaded holes on the board. Being that most boards use the same size standoff screw for M.2 SSDs I dont know why this is the most common option. The male end of the standoff  does not fit into the board.This was a waste of $5 and I should've called MSI first. It was their fault I was missing the standoff and screw anyway since the board was a replacement.
5,This case for the Kindle HD 8.9 fits very tight. The materials and quality of workmanship is top-notch. Everything fits so well throughout and truly feels like it was just made for my Kindle. The understated Crown logo in the lower right hand side is a nice touch. The faux leather (or pleather) is grained and has no funny smells.
5,Bought a new TV but it does not have component connections for my Slingbox M1 so I purchased this converter at the suggestion of Slingbox. Works as designed.
2,I had troubles to use it with My Skybox (SKY ITALY) connected to Slingbox. It does not work properly. I bought 2 pieces but both of them don't work. I don't know if it's due to a different HDCP compliant.
5,Worked really well signal is going to 14 TVs and did not need an amplifier.
5,The new Comcast boxes have only HDMI. This product worked perfectly. I did have to use an HDMI splitter first and then use this box.If you have an issue with the video but you hear audio- check your Comcast “video display” settings.
3,This is exactly what it says it is VGA -> RCA.  It does not work the other way around.  I wanted to hook a DVD player up to my computer monitor.  This did not accomplish that.
1,I don't have the time to list everything that went wrong in the first 5 minutes of use.
5,I was skeptical because of it's relatively low price but it's fantastic! We have been living with it for 4+ months now with no indication of any wear-n-tear.  It has been subjected to multiple business trips and repeated abuse by 2-yo twins and a 4-yo.The magnets for sleep and wake-up work as they should. The "leather" actually feels good and the stand-up position is more sturdy than far pricier models.Highly recommend!
5,So easy! I unnaturally both a new battery & new port in less than 10 minutes!7 to be exact.  Dint pay I repair $100 when you can do it for 25
3,It's not possible to buy an "old-style" portfolio case for an iPad Air. I don't know why that is (this style us probably cheaper to make) but this style does not really work to hold the device upright.
4,I bought several of these over 1 year ago so far no failures & they work fine.keep a couple extras on hand as HDMI cables do fail sometimes. price can't be beat in local stores.
2,The folding back did not seem strong to me. I sent it back disappointed - it looked OK in the picture.I have a very old case that has a fold out fromThe middle of the back.  Like picture frames. Would love to buy a new one like that but can not find it anywhere. There is  a snap that closes the kindle up.
4,similar to the case I orderd when new...not leather
5,This is definitely a case of getting more than what I paid for. I say that because I bought this package primarily for the case. For that alone I considered it a good price and it was. But the headset has excellent sound quality and the screen protector is a perfect fit. I don't really "need" the stylus but it is handy if I want to use the tablet while I'm eating.
4,Works like a charm. It's just so expensive!
5,Second attempt buying a screw for my new hard drive and this one fit perfectly! Very happy with that. I've heard of people having issues. My laptop is an ASUS GL753VD. It's from the ROG line.
5,This product allowed me to continue to use my Slingbox M1 with a Mediacom TiVo box.  The new cable box did not have the AV cable inputs on the back.  This worked perfectly as an adapter.
1,I couldn’t hear anything: they Do not work!
3,Apple The new iPad (iPad 3) iPad2 Clear(Regular) Screen protector is ok but hard to put on the screen and my wife put it one with a few bubbles but do not see when I use it.
5,This case is great! Good quality vibrant color and compact. I got this case before I went on vacation to Florida and I am so glad that I did. For this price you can't beat it! I am very pleased with this project and would recommend it to anyone that wants a simple case for their nook that is not bulky and still very easy to tuck into small bags/purses etc.
3,This cover fits the Nook very nicely but it has a smell to it. I don't know if it was from the packaging or what but it's been nine months now and it still has the smell.
4,Solid well made case. Two minor issues accessing volume control is slightlyharder and the "swipe-up" gesture is tough in landscape mode.
1,The earbuds stopped working after just a few weeks.
5,Worked great with the comcast system i was installing including the x1 platform however i have to pave a small 2 way spitter before fit the line to the modem there was just to much signal degradation to work well with high speed Internet but for the cable tv line works like a charm
5,I paired this amp with my Senn HD800S. I had tears in my eyes listening to music through this amp. The tubes need around 10 hours of break in after that this amp sounds great. Highly recommended.
3,Works as needed but the pricing gauging on this item is another story.
4,It's a bit bulkier than I expected but otherwise it's good. I purchased it so I could affix a slogan for "The Chive" Website that I cut on adhesive vinyl which goes well with the green case.
5,It looks great. My 40" TV is snug on the wall and the product functions as described.For installation you need : A Power Drill 7/32 Drill Bit (I had to use 1/4 Drill Bit) A phillips head screwdriver A Nut driver Drill bit (Or Nut tighten wrench) and a stud-finder. It doesn't come with any of these things.Took me about 30 minutes to install and i'm slow.
1,obnoxiously overpriced and does not meet the standards for mounting an m.2 drive.maybe it worked for other people but the threading on mine was too long preventing the head from making full contactwith the m.2 drives mounting point. This resulted in an unstable mount that allowed the drive to sway left or right whichas you might imagine could cause serious damage to your motherboard and cost you quite a lot of money.you'd think with such a high price for a single screw it'd at least be the right size.
5,I connected between STB and Slingbox and works as described since I was doing for Spectrum took a few YouTube videos and some playing around work settings but is working fine
3,Product works but the cable was not supplied as stated on their item description.
5,This case is well-built and attractive. I think it will do a good job protecting my Kindle Fire. I'm pretty careful with it anyway but I'm not as nervous about possible damage as I was prior to buying this. It's easy to grip and I have no trouble accessing all controls. The on/off magnet works well. I don't know how it works but it's clever. I'm very satisfied with this product.
5,This is a great case!  It works just like it is supposed to.  There is a space for the charger so you don't even need to open up the case to charge it all the time.  The space for the volume and power button are in a great place too.  If I ever need another case I will look into getting another one of these!
1,Sound quality sucks.  Can barley hear on a phone call
5,Purchased a new tv which required an updated sling box connection. Tried cheaper alternative. Did not work. This is pricey but did the job.
4,The case is good but it does not have enough protection on the sides. It's not as thick as it looks. The case does not always stay on the iPad as it easily slides off.
5,I originally ordered the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Standing Leather Case for $54.99. After receiving it I was very disappointed with it and sent it back. In my opinion it was certainly not worth the price. I then ordered the CaseCrown  Standby Case for $15. I have been very happy with it. It is perfect for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and for the price you can't go wrong.
5,The seller made things up by sending a "no cost" replacement of the missing parts and now my tv is hung on my wall. The construction of the hardware is sturdy and it holds my 39" tv with no problem it has an adjustable angle and again it is just as the seller describes.I recommend this wall mount for anyone that has a 39" tv it works great on mine.
5,I reviewed many cases - I wanted the perfect one for my wife's new iPad Air. Bought this one because it is very nicely designed and well thought out in terms of protecting the iPad while also being lightweight. My wife loves the aesthetics - the color elegance and beauty of it. Plus all the same reasons I like it. Simply put: a very good product & not very expensive. Thanks!
1,Let me explain. I bought this to try to hook up my computer to the TV. It doesn't work. Instead you need a convertor box. I ended up buying this one http://www.amazon.com/Sewell-Direct-SW-23000-PC-Converter/dp/B003BVVYSM and it works great! So from what I've heard this thing can work in situations where your computer has TV-out capabilities or something like that??? Apple computers don't. Or maybe this thing can be used to send a tv signal to a vga input??? I've tried some stuff and as far as I know you can't go from VGA to S-video or vice-versa. I think I wasted $8 on this thing. I'm probably just going to throw it away. Oh well.
5,Comcast only provides an HDMI port on their DVR boxes and the video component ports are necessary to add a Slingbox to your setup. This adapter solved my problems.
2,It converts however you lose the colors so what is the point! I wanted to convert a monitor so I could watch it as a tv. I used it previously with an hdmi cable and it worked beautifully. The new cable box would not allow an hdmi cable so I had to fins another route which was using this converter. I was very disappointed.
4,Perfect for what I need but now need to purchase an signal amplifier.
5,The CaseCrown Bold case for iPad Air is a very nice case. It has strong magnets to keep the front laying flat. (I had ordered a more expensive brand that didn't lay flat---really bugged me).  This is nice weight vegan leather with soft protective interior.  I bought the beautiful red color.  This case only feels expensive. It is very reasonably priced.  I highly recommend!
2,Screen protectors work as advertised and do a great job protecting the iPad screen.  However be prepared to spend some time working out the air bubbles.  The other frustrating part is any speck of dirt or dust will keep you from getting all the air pockets out.  No amount of wiping and cleaning was enough to get all the particles out.
4,Case works very well fits iPad air nice and snug.  Very happy so far with my purchase.  Having had other CaseCrown cases I am looking forward to it standing the test of time.
4,Love the color and the lightweight feel of this cover. I think the slit used for making the cover work as an easel could somehow be improved. Over all though nice product!
4,My brother in law told me that this works way better with the ps3 than anything so I went ahead and ordered it and he never lied everything is so clear on the TV and everything ran so smoothly
5,Get after market Tubes to improve sound. "One of the tubes that came with darkvoice was broke but I planned on replacing it anyways." The Darkvoice + HD600 headphones = tears of joy!
5,This is the case to buy for the Kindle. I bought another brand and the black dye rubs off and discolors the table (this one does not have black dye on the inside of cover). It also has the magnet (missing on the other one).
4,Love this cover for my fire. Took a star off cz of the stupid design where the way you have to hold it is opposite. Other wise a good product great material
5,Fits the ASUS Z-170-A motherboard and the Samsung 960 Evo.Please note: This screw is more than likely only going to work on Asus brand motherboards since they use a proprietary screw for their M.2 slots. One of the way reasons why it is priced so high.
5,I was skeptical at first just like the first review but since I was limited to finding any accessories in store in my area I went with it. I am overall pleased with the product I am glad I bought it. I got it mainly for the case and screen protector so the other three items were a plus for me. So to the point got two orders and we are happy.
1,the right earphone on one pair was busted out in the package and doesnt work.
3,item was at a GREAT price. Only negative on product would be it only has ONE position. Should be able to change to a couple of different angles for a better view.
1,They stopped working in a day
3,economy is key for this adapter. for installation jobs where it will remain in place will work but for mobile activity strongly suggest spending a few more dollars for an upgrade to this base model
5,This product was great for it's price. I mainly bought the package for the screen protector and the case. The screen protector was easy to apply and it claims to be washable and reusable. The case fits very well with all the proper cutouts. The headphone and stylus worked okay. I would definitely recommend this product because it's a steal considering most cases are around 10-20 and screen protectors are about 5-10.
3,This case is okay was completely crazy about it. It's great if you just want something to cover your nook. I love how bright the color is. I probably won't buy another one though...
5,It is super nice but wrong size. I searched for a PRO 11 case and picked my favorite color. Didn’t pay attention it was NOT the proper size.
1,These did not work for XR iPhone. It was a waste of my money.
3,1. It works. (it does fit M.2 SSD)2. This is over priced.
4,:)
5,Great case. Sturdy construction. Love the baby blue color. Pad fits in it like a glove and is well protected. Haven't had it long but I take my pad everywhere I go and the case is holding up beautifully. Can't beat the price. And thank goodness I have a place to put that dag on pencil!
5,Tryed it Out and its Works wow ive Never Known the Differences and what the Hype was about With the HDMI Wire  until now!Very Happy Customer!!!!!! :) Ordered this For my BF as a Early Xmas Gift && Boy was he Happy to know that it was no Scam & that it Worked Lol....Go For it You'll be an Happy Customer also && shipping was Great as well
4,Very good price for a quality case but the design of the case/kindle makes it so that you can't charge your kindle and stand up your kindle at the same time.
1,complete and total junk  constant static  do yourself a favor DONT BUY !!!
5,Wanted this as a 12 volt remote trigger. I needed a 3.55 mm to make RCA. Worked like a charm
5,Just got the product and I love it.It looks great which obviously has to be a factor to go with the already stylish iPad design.As a student I leave it in my bookbag for the most part (to make sure I never personally drop it while on the move) and it keeps my iPad clean and protected.Overall great item would definitely recommend getting this case!
5,I bought this case for my younger sister.  The leather is thick so it is very protective.  It has spaces to hold in the tablet so it does not fall out.  I have also had an apple case before and I think this is one is better.
5,After wasting $20 on one of the cheaper converters only to find that my Slingbox PRO-HD had sound but no picture I coughed up the money for this one and it worked great immediately.
3,Purchased for sister-in-law and she did not care for it.
1,Only lasted a konth
5,Works perfectly
5,I use this with slingbox media  M2 player. Needed it after cable box upgrade no longer had RCA connecters for slingbox M2.
1,I used this converter to connect my Slingbox M1 which only has composite connections to a Spectrum cable box that only has an HDMI connection.  It worked for 3 months without issue but now the audio is muffled on multiple platforms ;computer (PC and Mac) iPad and iPhone.  I have swapped out all cables and even switched to a different cable box.  The only common issue is the coverter/adapter.  It is useless in the current state.
5,Inexpensive little item that does exactly what it claims to no more no less. I bought two of them and so far both are working fine. I may change or update this review should anything happen in the next few months but overall very pleased with them!
5,I installed a new Radeon RX580 in my Mac tower (mid-2012). This connector made the transition from the 2 motherboard connectors without a problem. I'm now happily running Mojave and enjoying its new features.
5,This case was not what I expected when I ordered it. I thought for the price it would just be a temporary flimsy cover until I could find one locally. It is awesome. The color is good and the quality is excellent. I would recommend this case for anyone. It is comfortable to use with its elastic strap and the stand has two options for supporting ipad.
4,good
5,Fast delivery.  The case was exactly as advertised it fits the Kindle perfectly with all the cut outs just where they belong.  I love the automatic on/off feature.  Just close the cover and it shuts down open it up and it turns on...great.  I wish the cover for my Xoom did that.I got it for a stupid low price...couldn't be happier.
5,Ordered this adapter and it arrived 11 days later very easy to install took 5 minutes for hook up and another 10 minutes to reconfigure slingbox it now works perfect...would definitely recommend
3,To me it was too bulky though it covers every corner and looks very sturdy. I wanted a slim case. I had to return it unfortunately.
5,Works great. Charges it at a good pace for the capacity Z-Batteries have
5,Fits my I pad well.  My last case was a snug brand and the leather stretched out and I pad flopped around in it.  Hopefully this one will not do so after time and use.  I am in and out of my I pad continuously every day.
4,This is a great case for the price.  Easy enough to remove from the case when I want to put it in a seat mount but protects my Kindle when in there.
5,The product is worth every penny the reason y I say that is be cuz is the amazing sound quality that this amp provides is out of this world
5,I got this turned out I had a 8 pin in my power supply the whole time but I still tried this out and it worked great would say yes to buying this if you only had 6 pin and wanted to get a card with 8 pins.
5,5 in 1 Black Leather Case with Screen Protector / Stylus / Headset / Micro HDMI Cale for Acer ICONIA TAB A100Works great.  I bought these products on 2013.  I still currently use it.I bought these at regular price. I wrote my honest review at my own will and free time.
5,I have an Asus X370 Prime motherboard and apparently it did not came with an m.2 screw for my new Samsung 970 Evo SSD and this product fits perfectly
5,I bought this for my husband to replace his worn out case   and it's perfect. He really loves it. He especially loves the hand strap on the back when you want to hold the iPad in portrait mode it works great
5,It’s an overpriced screw but who cares we lost the screw that came with our mobo. We shouldn’t complain because the people who want m.2 drives can afford a single over priced screw
4,This product was reasonable in price so if it doesn't work out I'm not out much. It seems to work well although it is hard to get it totally installed without a couple bubbles
5,I bought 2 of these a black one for myself and this green one for my wife. Device fits perfectly easy access to all the buttons..and the flap folds back all the when for reading. Light weight and durable. Good value for the money. Not the most attractive of cases but functional and way better than most of the other cases offered on here for the money.
4,I ordered this case for a friend. She was very pleased with it and says it was a perfect fit for her tablet.
4,Arrived in good time.  This item was gifted to my nephew.  I installed it on his Nook and it fit well.  Appeared well made and would buy this  product again.
4,Holds my TV nice and steady.  Only problem is that once the tv is in the wall and tilted: it's pretty much impossible to reach the secondary safety bolts to fix the angle.
3,Does not transmit signal well within walls
5,All my cords fit and I still have room for more
4,Product is great......well worth the price! I would definitely recommend this to anyone...the one thing I didn't like was that it a tad to big for my device....but overall it's a great product.
5,Decent with stock tubes..... have the DROP CTH Hybrid and it has a much lower noise floor and sounds causes MUCH less listening fatigue
4,Great case! Does the job at a great low price. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a case for their Kindle Fire HD. I love the sleep feature on this case!
5,Tried couple of other devices this is the only one work with a Slingbox if you're looking for something to connect with your Sling gears this is the one to go.
3,came in a package that was folded to fit in my mailbox. So maybe a "do not bend" sign or a piece a cardboard in envelope will help for next time
4,This case is perfect for my nook and a great price. It's nothing fancy just a simple soft leather with a magnetic closure. Get's the job done for me and it was less than $10.
3,Not fond of having my Kindle without a case. This helps protect it. Not fancy and not the best but it serves a purpose and you get what you pay for.
3,Doesn't cover all corners when open and in use. The stand is very unstable and comes out easily (such a pain). True to color and a solid case for the price.
3,Because of where the button holes align you have to hold the case upside down which makes it open awkward from left to right a reversed book. Quality etc is nice.
5,Use this for my Slingbox M2. Make sure you configure the Slingbox for COMPONENT instead of COMPOSITE to get the HDMI signal to properly convert.
5,This cover fit's like a glove. It looks and feels "High End" I carry it in my backpack for travel which is 60 percent of my week and it still looks new 3 months later.  I haven't used it as a folding stand so I can't comment on that feature.  Overall I rate it a GREAT BUY!Good Luck ... The Dude
4,Both cables worked great. The only issue I had was that they sent only one cable instead of two. Once contacted they sent the 2nd cable right away. Great product and great seller.
3,GOT THIS WITH A COMBO BUT. DO NOT HAVE A USE YET BUT IM SURE WITH ALL THE HOOK UPS WE AT HOME IT WILL COME IN HANDY BEFORE LONG.
4,Discs have been perfect. However you need a specific type of Sharpie to write on it - the thick one. The other types melt away into the label or something. Otherwise great product.
4,Giving this a 4 because it does not burn 25 gigs as advertised it only burns a little over 23. Otherwise the product was delivered quickly and so far has given me no problems
4,However it did not fit the Kindle I bought it for. Customer error. I purchased another for my 8.9 model and I like the convenience of 'hands free' reading.
4,Pretty decent cover for the money. I like that it shuts the Fire off when you close it.
2,Broke after second uses
5,I always carry all my cables etc. jumbled up in a plastic cosmetic bag. This is going to be so much easier!  Wish I were going on a trip soon!
5,Just what I needed to replace the cover on my IPad Air device.  It works as promised and didn't cost an arm-and-a-leg to obtain.  Should provide me with years of protection as well as allowing me to find my device quickly and easily!
5,I read the reviews and was cautious buying this because of all the complaints regarding the toxic fumes. The smell was present for about 24 hours and then went away. Nothing remotely as dramatic and dire as others have reported.  This fits great. It has two kickstands. Really inexpensive but doesn't look cheap. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family.
3,This case is average.  It feels good if protects the kindle well but it is not a sturdy stable stand.  The magnetc close is very good though.
3,Needs to be more sturdy
5,Product worked as expected. I used it send picture from laptop to big screen. Problem is I used s-video which gave me a fuzzy picture. Not a fault of this product
4,The case worked very well for my Acer.  The microHDMI cable works great.  The screen protector is crummy and the headphones are subpar but for the price this was a good deal.
5,Great product. I replaced my cable box and it was not compatible with my Slingbox. This product solved my problem.
5,Works with Genie mini (single hdmi port) and Slingbox M2 perfectly!  Finally I can use my Slingbox from out of town again!!
4,It worked great but it is hard to get the bubbles out. They don't bother me much anymore though. Now the bubbles are just on the black part of the iPad.
5,Product arrived on time and packaged well. It works perfectly as well.
5,Works perfect with my slim box 500
4,Purchased as a gift for my mother's kindle fire.  Fits well and stands up.  She likes it a lot it does everything it is supposed to do! Recommended buy
4,These are good speaker wire connectors at a great price. My only draw back is the banana plug ends don't fit as tightly as I would like.Sound quality is very good and it has a high end look to them!
2,I purchased this in red for my iPad Air but I need to send it back. It fits perfectly and the sleep function works great but the smell is overbearing. If it were available in leather I'd have chosen that option but it's not and I can only assume the smell is due to the synthetic material. It stinks!
5,I could not find a case or a screen protector in any of the stores in my area. I found this one online was a little weary of it being from an "offbrand" and not straight from Acer.  It fits perfectly and everything that came with it works perfect and is correct size for my A100.  Thank you so much.  Also Came by the time promised.
5,GutsParker's M.2 Standoff and Screw was unbelievable. It arrived quickly tightly sealed in two containers. The best part? There were doodles on the invoice. Much appreciated. Most expensive screws I've ever purchased but the drawings made it worthwhile.
4,I realy like my notebook case for my kindle fireI would like to buy 2 more if any one need one this is the right one to get.
3,Not compatible with Samsung tv with my strix 1070 from my pc
3,The mount applies to the TV just fine except the adjusts are hard to get to in the back to prevent it from tilting! hard to reach once mounted!
3,I love the storage box but never received the indext album which I really wanted.  I hope it will come there was not an itemized statement with it.
3,Can live with it .. For the money u pay its ok. Looks cheap so .. If it's for home use and functional.. Go for it .. Will recommend
5,Great iPad cover. It’s easy to hole or prop up.Also love the way it folds over my iPad screen and shuts it down.
4,I like the case.  However it came without any instructions.  A few instructions abo ut how to put the tablet in it and how the stand works would have been useful.
5,Súper la herramienta funciona y batería exacta
4,Fits well good material. well made. The volume button is kind hard to reach compared to our old cover.
3,This is a nicely made piece but don't expect it to take the VGA output of your computer and convert it to S-video/RCA.  It won't do that.
4,I returned a more expensive case by a different vendor and bought this one.  It is excellent.  It fit s perfectly and is a good value.
2,Took forever to arrive didn't realize it was coming from China.  It seemed ok in quality but it didn't work for me.  I was trying to go from a vga output on a security dvr unit to a monitor rca input but it scrambled the signal.  Not worth trying to return.
3,Seems a little on the cheap side.  The color is lovely.  Not sure about the craftsmanship.  Decided to buy another for a Christmas gift instead.
4,It feels cheap but it does the job. It was a little difficult to put on but what screen protector isn't difficult to put on? I would reccomend this product to a friend.
3,hope your mechanically ept to putting this together LOL No instructions but fairly easy to figure out for the money I bought two only got aggravated once .
4,Worked fine for my iPad but the corner was a little bent. No complaints though! Has lasted me at least a year now
3,Only one concern unable to smooth out all the bulbs under the screen saver.  They appear as water spots are under the screen saver  fit perfectly.
1,Poor quality. Broken on arrival
5,This is a great case.  Easy to openfoldand rest the Ipad on it.  The odor  was bad at first but some shoe  "water proofing" spray on a paper towel rubbed on the case took care of that.  I will use it periodically to clean the case as needed.  Again a good product.  Thank you again.
4,Works as advertised
5,I was thrilled to be able to return the $50 cover that I impulsively bought at Best Buy along with my Kindle HD 8.9". This CaseCrown cover cost less than $10 and works just fine has holes for all the buttons and a magnet to wake the device up when you open the cover. Props up as well. Has held up fine so far.
1,So disappointed that these headphones didn’t work
2,The screen protector is not appropriate for an iPad 3. It is impossible to get the bubble free screen with this product. Moreover the seller sent the screen protector in a envelope without proper protection so the product was already damaged when arrived. After trying a couple of times to get it bubble free I gave up.
2,When I plugged this into a laptop and tried to goto a regular TV with a S-Video input I got a messed up picture of the laptop desktop screen on the regular television and nothing I did in the settings of the TV or the Laptop would change the effect. therefore this product isn't what it states.
3,The case seems cheap and is not made out of good product. It seems fleemzy around the screen and bends.
3,This converter adapter cable does convert your VGA output to S-video output.  The price was a lot cheaper than what one can find in electronic stores.
5,Worked as it should! Good build quality. I needed it for my camper which had some "friends" that chewed through the last set. This solved the problem for a very low price.
1,Paid $2.20 for this screen protector and was highly disappointed. It shipped to the USA from Hongkong and after I opened the package I could see that the edges of the protector were bent. I tried to put it on anyway but it looked horrible. I did have luck moving the air bubbles out but the amount of bending that was caused by an inferior product or by poor shipping method caused major "bubblage" around the home button and along the top and sides. I ended up throwing it away.
4,The case performs as advertised and for the price it can't be beat.  It isn't genuine leather but I didn't expect it to be and it does the job just fine.
3,it's ok. does not stick like I wanted it to. I followed the directions required. It has a few bubbles but it's ok. I'll live with it.
1,My phone didn’t even recognize the device as plugged in
4,Bought this for my husband and he is very happy with it.  He can easily find it in his carry all and thinks it was a good purchase!
4,I used this cable to run two screens from one output and was very happy with the price and quality. I have not been able to test it under working conditions yet.
5,I would by one of these again. the Speakon has 4 contacts so I could change the pin out for my bridged amp
5,Excellent device for my Slingbox 500 & the new smart tv purchased with no component inputs. Small compact unit unobtrusive. Well constructed.
3,Product was a little worn out and instructions were vague.  I'm still satisfied with my purchase due to the fact this didn't make the product unusable.
5,Worked perfectly on my MSI Tomahawk B350 mobo. That being said the price is insane but I couldn't find it anywhere else.
4,Fast delivery. Very easy to install. Works great.
1,I bought it because it have apple pencil holder. The case is too heavy and the material is stiff. I had a hard time to use it.  holder is too small I have to push hard enough to put my apple pencil inside the holder. More over it use magnet to attach to the case. I have to unattached it every time I use it.  not recommend this product.
5,I purchased this Apple iPad Screen Protector as a backup for the case I bought. After receiving a case with the screen damaged by other items packaged in same box I thought it might be wise to have a backup for the new case just in case. It is stored away but I like knowing it is there. I recommend this product.
3,I bought it for myself and a friend. It is sturdy nd worked well.  I would tell others about it and the price is great
1,Did not produce sound and functionality
5,This is a really nice case and works well with the sleep/wake feature. My wife liked this case so well for her Kindle that I bought the 7" case for my daughter's Kindle but the 7" case does not work with the sleep/wake feature on her Kindle but my FINTIE case for my Kindle does work with sleep/wake on my daughter's Kindle.
3,It does protect pretty well but after I put it on there was still a bunch of bubbles. But compared to the price it's pretty good.
4,works in windows not in my linux.  i tired using this with arch and arch never detected it. as well ubuntu couldnt detect it. windows does so not to bad.
3,This case is OK.  The price is good so I have no complaints.It serves the purpose for which it was purchased.
1,These headphones never worked.
5,This is my 3rd purchase of one of these.  I have one for myself one for my wife and purchased two for our church.  Just the right balance of protection and convenience.
3,Doesn't stand up well most of the time but other than that it does the job. For the price I really can't complain.
5,Muy económico y funcional
1,How’d you know I have two left ears 😁
3,The size is good but it had creases in it so therefore it has air bubbles in it but for the price its good enough
5,Bought two of these to hook my laptop to my tv and another just to have around for future use.  The one I used works great.  I hooked it up to the tv and laptop the day I received them and it's been running great for three weeks.  It's even been kicked stepped on and ran over with a vacuum cleaner and keeps working.
1,I purchased this cable to connect my laptop computer to my tv across a fairly small room. When I received the cable I noticed it would not plug in to the hdmi on my computer all the way. It went in part of the way but would not go all the way in. Concerned that there might be a problem with the plug on the computer I tried a different cable it plugged in just fine. I have filed a claim and hope to get this resolved.
5,Grate amplifier I used this too amplify and distribute HDTV signal from an antana mounted in the attic.  FYI  you need too terminate any unsed outputs with a 75 ohm terminator..
1,i bought this thing and when it came in the mail i tested it. it didnt work. so i contacted the seller and asked them why it didnt work so they agreed on sending me another one.they agreed on giving it to me for free but THEY CHARGED ME FOR IT!!!! then when i tested the new one it STILL DIDNT WORK. so if you are going to buy this DONT BUT IT FROM EFORCITY. PAY A FEW DOLLARS MORE FOR A NICE ONE THAT ACUTALLY WORKS
4,Good fit and adds a layer of protection for your tablet
2,I thought these were the same for all mobos with m.2 slots but it dose not work with the gigabyte aorus x399 the male end is much to small. plus thats a high price for a tiny screw
5,We use this on travel trips connecting an HDMI output from our Laptop to HDMI inputs of Hotel TVs to watch our own movies/t.v. shows/etc. This cable has worked flawlessly since day one and we're very happy with it. And we cannot notice any degradation in playback but even if we get just a couple years out of it that would be considered money well spent.
5,security cam monitor.
1,I recently bought an M.2 NVME SSD and my computer did not come with a mounting screw so i thought this would be all i need. Nope! Screw and the standoff ended up being too small to fit into the thread on my computers motherboard. Very disappointed with the seller who clearly does not identify which motherboard brands this works with. Buyer beware!
5,easy to install and work ok
1,One head phone is no good .
4,Excellent value looks nice fits well and provides good protection.  Would have liked an elastic strap to hold the cover in but magnets work really well.
5,Everyone in our family uses this iPad cover and will continue to. The one I have now is red. We have also had navy and black.
5,Bought to upgrade my Slingbox M1 stream from SD to HD and it does this extremely well.
5,Works as expected.I have confirmed it works with newer Meru/Fortinet APs. Now when I try to RMA an AP I can tell the support person "It's dead! It won't light up AND it won't telnet."
2,It did not work for my application but I am trying to something it was not intended for.  I was trying to connect the SVideo from my Verizon SD receiver to the monitor that I have with VGA input.  I did got the picture but it was black and white no color.
5,I love these cases. This is the third one I've bought as I have upgraded to a different iPad. It has sturdy features and holds up well. I can stand it in two different positions. The top closure works great in putting the iPad to sleep mode. Would definitely buy again.
5,One of the nicest tablets cases that I own. Fit and quality excellent for a reasonable price. The stylist and pen a nice added touch. All cutouts exactly located. Looks like it should hold up well with use!.E
4,Works Great
5,Easy to install and did exactly what was advertised. Upgraded my 750ti to a RX 570 8gb in an old Dell XPS 8700
3,It is ok... I am glad there is three because the first one would not stick in the corner that the tabs were on.
3,An okay product but you get what you paid for! The plastic get dirty quickly buy they are cheap enough to continue buying more
5,Good product
3,Item was all that I expected I am very pleased with this product! I would definitely recommend this item to my friends and family.
3,very cheap price  cheap material but worth the $4 I paid for it . It works. It is what it is.
5,Works perfectly with sling box and fios one.  Set up in 5 min using diagram under pictures
5,Verizon QMV7A would scarcely charge above 20%. Replaced battery with this one. Now charges to 100% and works perfectly.  Five stars
4,This is a functional case at a good price.  It's obviously imitation leather but I didn't want to pay for leather so I have no complaint.
4,This fits like a glove and helps protect my kindle if it were dropped.  Fast shipping great product for the price.  Would recommend it anyone.
1,It says it is air-bubble-proof which is a complete lie and false advertising. Terrible experience no instructions on how to take out the hundreds of air bubbles once the plastic it applied. I have worked with decals many times and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had trying to apply this screen protector to my I-pad. DO NOT BUY unless you like wasting time and money. Keep a little cloth with your i-pad and occasionally wipe it down. Screen protectors are a joke.
5,An excellent case for a 8.9 Kindle Fire HD. This is a slim case that feel great carrying in your hand. The inside felt padding protects the Kindle very well.I also find the "wake" feature when you open your case as a plus. Opening your Kindle case wakes up the Kindle and closing it puts it to sleep. Excellent feature.
1,Save your money. Terrible quality.
5,I used this to connect a fire tv stick and it worked perfectly with the slingbox 500. Did what it said.
5,Don't waste money on higher cost cables they send the exact same data as long as the connection is good and these are snug fitting high quality cables.
2,This case is somewhat generic. The cutout around the home button doesn't allow my fingerprint recognition to work.Also there is a piece of elastic that I can't figure out the purpose of?It's fine but I'd rather have a case made specifically for the model of iPad I currently have.
5,Best iPad case ever!!!  This case is beautiful and fit my iPad Air perfectly.  Made from high quality materials and very durable.
4,Works as advertised great little unit.
5,Worked as advertised.  Used to connect DirecTV Genie which has only HDMI output to Slingbox 500.  Very satisfied!
3,Started bugging out on me after a few months. Flickering. Changed the cable it was indeed the cable. You get what you pay for.
4,Looks great. I'm planning on giving it as a gift and it looks pretty sturdy. I'm not sure if it fits yet but I'll find out soon.
4,Works good fits my ipad perfect .  Would recommend to friends and family. Once applied can't tell it's on the face of the tablet good buy
4,works great. super long too
3,I was looking for a RCA video to VGA to use a video source to a monitor. Does not work that way.
3,is alright left some little bubbles and in one corner the protector is bigger so i had to cut it a little bit
4,..of protecting my new iPad.  Had one on my old iPad for years.  Dropped it numerous times; total protection. Just sold it on eBay.
4,The screen protector was prone to bubbles and I had to discard it.  The stylus was quite poor in construction/integrity.  The case headset and HDMI cable work nicely.
3,Disappointed it came with handprint on sticky side.  Other than that it is okay.  I have no plans of returning it.
4,It is ok purchase after all considering the price. It says on the box bubbles free but had hard time placing the protector on my iPad with no bubbles.
4,It was very easy to install. With the built in level it made it easy to get the mount correct. All od the necessary hardware was included with the kit.
5,Lost the M.2 screw set that came with my Asus Z370 Prime-A motherboard and this fit and worked perfectly for a Mushkin Pilot 120gb nvme.
4,I received the HDMI cord about 2 weeks ago.  The cord makes a great difference while playing the PS3.  I received an awesome HDMI cord at a very cheap price!!!!
5,I was so impressed at the quality of this cover for my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9'.  I have had the cover now for about threemonths and it still looks brand new.  Feels and looks like leather. Very sturdy and I highly recommend to those who wantto spend less money yet still have a quality cover.
2,I was looking for a case to replace my I-Smile case I bought several years ago. This one is not the quality I wanted but once you buy it it's yours. No returns.
4,Nice to have one on the iPad but pain in the butt to put on:( it's all bubbly :( I should have had some one help me
5,Product is well made easy to install and was exactly what I needed for my new video card. After over a month working flawlessly
4,I received an extra pair of headphones but no HDMI cable. (a little disappointing). The case is almost a perfect fit but is for all intents and purposes practical!
5,Works great. I have no issues with the picture quality and does split the image for the sling box.
1,I have spent countless hours trying to get this device to work.  I have a TiVo BOLT VOX trying to connect a Slingbox Pro HD  has anybody succeeded?  Slingbox no longer provides support and can't see where the HDMI adapter device manufacturer offers support.  Has anybody been successful in the Tivo Bolt Vox Slingbox connection?
5,Fit perfect for my m.2 installing on my motherboard. Seems just the right height to bring it up and screws down tightly enough.
1,These sound terrible and are awkward. Can’t recommend.
5,This is exactly the cable you need to put a Radeon RX 580 video card into an Early 2009 MacPro desktop.Easy-peasy.
5,Worked great in our boat
3,It is a nice kit. Very simple. Wish it came with a waterkine option. It is not worth more than $20.
3,Yes was good n had anew I pad n thank u for doing this for me n u the best till now
1,Being it was just a little over $3 I didn't expect the absolute highest quality. However sending me a product that is 100% unusable is ridiculous. First of all it was bent up all over. The corners were bent and so was a spot on the middle of it.  I can understand if I was having a problem with bubbles under the screen but the product I was sent was mistreated and damaged before I even got it and could not be used.
3,Purchased in a hurry and did not do my research.  This item CANNOT connect your computer to your TV.
3,Case could fit more snug HDMI cable works great ear buds work okay screen protector easy to scratch never used the stylus
4,The case screen protector and cable are pretty nice. The headphones and stylus are worthless. For the price you pay though its a good deal over all.
3,I didn't get this yet. Where is the screen protector? Or did you deliver it? Or is it here? Is it here?
3,It bent too easily and there was a lot of dents in it because of this fact. Also it didn't stick well.
3,Just bought for testing
3,Iam having problems getting all of the bubbles out of it.  Other than that it is working ok.  Good buy
4,Way better than going to a retail store and getting a cover. These are custom made for the kindle. Dont waste your time in retail stores.
1,Drains battery does not work without Bluetooth.
3,I gave this product 3 stars only because its only a thin piece of plastic. But it serves its purpose.
5,I was a little worried about how it would hold up considering it cost under $10. I bought a leather one with a keyboard and it didn't last 6 months. Well so far I've been pleasantly surprised. It was worth every penny I paid for it and it's a great deal. I will never spend $30 on a case again.
4,The product came with a weird smell but it eventually went away and the case works well
3,A little bulky but serves the purpose. Probably need that since my son is a little clumsy with electronics. No
1,The first one I received was not working.  So I sent it back for a replacement.  The second One worked great.........that is until it stopped working about 5 weeks later.  Not sure if I got a dude again or is it that this product is just cheaply made.  Save your money.
1,No sound 👎🏼
1,Sound quality is so poor I immediately tossed this one in the trash. With the cost of about $2 I didn't bother returning it. I guess this is a perfect example of you get what you pay for!
4,thanks for everything sorry for the late  post
2,While the product does protect the tablet it is not a true leather case. The top does not lay flat on the screen when in closed position. The crease for the stand position does not fold flat like it does on some other models. Over all it is rather cheaply constructed.
1,The wires on this adapter are paper thin. They are e tremely poor quality and I would never even consider using this low quality product.  I am extremely disappointed. Please Do Not Buy. My application was for an Nvidia 2070 Super. Id never even consider using this product. It is terrible. Buyer Beware!
5,This battery was perfect and solved my problem of overheating battery.  Inexpensive.  Would recommend going to U-tube to watch video on installing new battery.  You really can do it with this battery and kit.  Great!
3,Unsure if quality was worth it. Used once nod didn't  like the feel of item so removed it from iPad.
4,quite good everithing only problem the address sorry thanks
4,it works well for what I  need it for.  glad I  chose  this one.  thank  you! for this product. happy
3,The case is strong and protective But so thick that I can't reach any of the buttons.
4,Works fine.  A little hard to keep in the tabs to prop up but overall protects my iPad and works fine.
5,Replaced the Shiit stack and I love the sound that come out this tube amp. I also replaced the tubes with RCA ones.Happy with this purchase. =]
5,Have used several different CD's for buring audio CD's and this is by far the best period.  Soud is at least as good as another reviewer noted as a SACD and I would add perhaps better.  That this has a estimated shelf life of 300 yrs is a big plus.  bottom line do not hesitate to buy these.
4,Nice color and the overall cover looks good too.the onlh issue is its haed to make the ipad stand as the cover is prettry hard.
4,This case is exactly as described.  Good quality & protection for a reasonable price.  Lightweight & multifunctional. I highly recommend  this item.
5,its a good product ; i bought handful of them ... i recommenef them
5,I purchased this to connect my Slingbox. It works perfectly and in fact has made the signal stronger than before.
4,Good for the price but bubbles are impossible to get out. I wouldn't buy this again just because I hate hate hate the bubbles.
5,Worked perfectly with my Asus H110M-E/M.2 motherboard. After a lot of searching I found that this is really the only place you can get this tiny dumb proprietary screw.
3,This is a great price..I do have a few bubbles (like 3 or 4) so I can't complain too much.
4,It works well for me.
1,I would like the company to reach out to me regarding the trouble I’m having before I have to return the item. I purchased this same item before and it worked for a years so I would hate to have to return something that I know worked in the past.
1,I have Lenovo idea-pad Laptop S10-2. I tried to connect it to CRT- TV. and LCD-TV. trough this  VGA to RCA /S-video adapter but it makes  just white lines on the tv. screen and Lenovo screen goes blank when connect trough S-video. According to Lenovo tech.support  my Idea-pad video card supports RCA/S-video connection. I connected Lenovo's VGA-connector to external display's VGA. it works just fine sothis adapter do nothing for TV connection. I'm sorry for bad experience with 'Eforcity'
4,I really like this item. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because there was no stylus holder.
1,Horrible don’t waist your money
5,It took a while to receive the product but I like the product.
5,80% of the time the sleep mode does not work which leaves me with a depleted battery ☹️
1,Can’t get either of them to work
3,Great splitter for homes that have multiple outlets
4,This case is perfect. It fits my Ipad Air perfectly price is fantastic. Very excited. My only recommend would be a stylus holder somewhere.
4,The case fit perfect and was very reasonable price
4,This case is perfect except for the color.  I would have preferred a forest green. Please come out with other colors please.
5,Worked like a charm with my Slingbox.  I had no trouble connecting it and it’s working perfectly.
3,ok
4,This is the protector with cheap price and can be used. We use it for iPhone 4S. It is not expensive and is OK to use.
5,A little on the pricey side but works fine with my Slingbox M2.
4,Does it's job just fine I've used it for a while.Wish it did audio as well but I guess that's why we have HDMI now.
4,Very nice case; husband really likes it - especially the hand slot on inside of pad cover.
5,works great with mc pro 51 and mojave. installed an Rx580 8gb and a NVME and my 2010 mac is like new.
3,Too small
4,Works as expected. Thanks!
5,I received this case about 2 months ago.  I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced cover.  It did have a slight smell to it when I removed the packaging but I let it air out for a short time and it is perfectly fine now.
5,I needed these adapters to allow RCA cables to plug into BNC ports on my LaserDisc player. These worked great and are a good value for a set of this size.
5,Exact replacement for the cable that came with my QC35s.
5,I just had to bring my IPad into Apple and the very nice fellow that took care of me was extremely impressed with this cover. He asked me where I got it and of course I told him Amazon... where else... I've had several covers and for sure this one is the best to date...
5,This is so perfect! When I am home I keep my cords nice and neat and when I travel my cords are ready to go!
4,It worked. I liked it.  Its like nothing is there. The price was worth it. The screen protector  just took too long to come.
5,Perfect replacement stand off. I purchased my motherboard a few years ago and lost the original stand-off. This was a drop-in replacement and worked great.
5,Works great for powering a SAPPHIRE NITRO+ Radeon RX 480 100406NT+8GOCL 8GB 256-Bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 x16 HDCP Ready Video Card's 8 pin PCIE connector from 2 separate 6 pin power connectors on my Ultra 650W power supply.
5,I had a blue one that had been mistreated over the last 4/5 years. This one makes my Kindle look new again. Protects Kindle one accidental dropsetc.
5,This case is a great fit for my new Kindle 8.9. It's sturdy enough to protect the screen from damage and automatically turns off the kindle when the magnets connect. It is designed so that music can be heard clearly. I bought this figuring I would get something better or sturdier eventually but this works just fine.
4,I am not into spending tins of money on things but I am impressed with the quality of his case for the price.
2,The first time I got it it was in a very bad state so they sent me another one and it still wasn't in a perfect state but I put it on my iPad anyways but the thing is that it scratches really easily and looks really bad...
4,We purchased this product for our new house and it was great.  I didn't hear any complaints from the family that we had install it :)
4,Great price. Quality is exception with the price. Had more than 3 months as heavy users and still good condition.
2,The case does the job but because it opens and closes the Black part on the outer edge is coming off. For the price I paid I’d expect better.
5,It was awesome one my friend referred this item and it was amazing because it is protecting from scratches for hard disk easy to handle it I will recommend everyone to buy it
4,I would reccomend this to anyone who needs a screen protector for their iPad. I slipped it on perfectly and it had no air bubbles whatsoever.
5,It worked exactly as advertised one day my slingbox no longer showed the picture due to copyright restrictions. This restored everything back to the way it was.
5,This is the best case for the money for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I am absolutely shocked that it is only $4.00. This is a steal for that price. This is NOT a 4 dollar case. I am totally satisfied and highly recommend it to any person who owns a Kindle fire. You won't be disappointed.
5,This product worked well to secure my M2 solid state harddrive in my computer.
4,Very pleased with product with the exception of the odor. Chemical smell lingered for a couple of weeks but all is good now. Love it
4,This product offers good protection for my ipad. It fits nicely. I don't use the stand much though. I love the red color.
4,From what i've seen it has been good!  Seems sturdy and not as cheap as some of the cases I have seen.
5,This is a great screen protector. A little challenging to put on but I was able to do it. It does get bubbles after a while but for the price you can just buy another. It is clear with no antiglare but I like that so that it doesn't dim the screen and interfere with the Retina display.
5,This cover is almost identical to the more expensive Belkin cover I bought for another e-reader before down to the magnetic closure which I like. The material is of course not the same but then it is much much cheaper. I carry my e-reader with me everywhere and the cover is standing up to a lot of handling.
4,Not like a leather one but price is right.  It protects it.  Will probably get a different one at some point.
4,Fits well on the Kindle. For some reason I cannot make it stand up by itself as it shows in the ad.
4,The air bubbles were very hard to get rid of though but the price is nice compare to other screen protecters :P
4,I purchased this for my Grandson. He is very happy with the case. Good fit. He likes the hand hold.
5,What fun! I took a repurposed broken security camera with a BNC connection and was able to use this device to watch on a VGA computer monitor. Next is to connect to a DVR! Works good fair price good delivery = Happy Boy!
5,Tenía el Bravo audio v2 este es una gran actualización. No te va a defraudar. Cambie los tubos en lo posible.. feliz de usar con sennheiser hd800
4,Does what it is meant to do protects the iPad against scratching and dust.  No complaints here.  Would buy again
5,I got this case for my new iPad Pro 9.7. It fits perfect and looks great. The pencil case is magnetic and it is strong as of now. I had read that some people have had issues with this but I haven't yet.
4,It came a little dented so it didn't go on as well as I liked. Wished they put it in a better package
5,This case is a great buy. It fit my iPad very well. Holds it in place without any damage. It would be a better buy if it came with a crees protector. The 3slot choices for the angle it leans on are ok. The feel and quality of the material is fantastic however.
5,The shippment was pretty quick and the screen protector fits great but the only problem I have with it is the fact that the film seems to be thinner than what I expected. It seems to be able to withstand all the torture I have subjected it to so far. Overall I would recommend this product
5,Haven't found a place where this was too short. You can always use it for a shorter distance but 6' doesn't stretch to 8'. It served our purpose and have had no problem with it being too long. Signal is good.
5,I am really happy with this purchase.  The cover/case fits my kindle hd 8.9 perfectly!  The magnetic cover automatically puts my ki dle in sleep mode when closed saving battery.  It wakes quickly when the cover is opened again.  Well designed and protects my tablet as well.  A super buy!!!
5,The cable was priced right and was in wonderful condition. It just did not do what I was trying to accomplish. I am sure that if you was hooking up to a TV it would work fine. I was trying to hook my laptop computer to a MovieMate projector and it was not designed to accept this connection.
4,I like having my Kindle enclosed in this case.It gives great protection and is very convenient.The stand is very handy.
4,Bought two different colors of this cover for gifts to others for their Nook Simple Touch readers. Very nice fits the Nook perfectly
1,This cable causes my PS3 HDMI video output to stop after only a few moments of operation. If I turn off my PS3 and wait a short while before again powering up the video returns for a short period before stopping again. The cable looks fine without any visible flaws.  I am assuming there is an internal problem that overloads the video from the PS3 but that is only a guess as to why I have a problem.
4,Works great on my 42" TV
4,I like the case. Wake and sleep features great. Price and delivery reasonable. Would have liked more folding and or viewing positions.
4,The leather case and screen protector fit perfectly! The ear piece looks cheap but who cares it works!Recommended for buyers looking for budget stuff!
4,This product was a good purchase.  It was a great price for the item.  I would recommend this to others.
4,It is working well so far no regrets. I liked the color to just what I expected. I would recommend this product.
4,DID WHAT I WANTED IT ROT.THANK YOU
5,I just like it
5,Bought this to connect to my laptop on my work/study desk so I could use a wireless keyboard/mouse set to game on my HDTV on the other side of the room without having to disconnect/reconnect everything constantly.
3,The case is nicely made but it does not easily stay standing (as in the picture).
1,I admit iam a dumb a ss and didnt buy the right thing wanted to connect laptop to TV.IT worked but showed black and white and was awful.Instead i just bought this   High Speed HDMI Cable 6 feet  (Colors may vary)        It worked crystal clearawsomesound and better than this cr ap.* If you want to conect your laptop to TV with the product above make sure both laptop and Tv have HDMI ports.
1,I have other wall mounts that work very well this wall mount is a very poor design for the tilt my tv is a 57in it holds the tv but the tilt wont lock its 15 degrees tilt no matter how tight u got the screws I had to modify the tilt bracket by drilling holes and placing screws in the bracket to hold it in place .what should have taken only 45 min turned into 2hr project
5,I lost the standoff that came with my mobo and this fit perfect.  I would buy again.
4,All mostly good with this but a little work is required to get out the bubbles between it and the screen.
4,Works well.
5,I have 2 cases One for I-pad generation 4 and the other for I-Pad Air. Both are "Great" and priced right for sure. The I pads fit like a glove in them and they are really handy anyway which you wish to use them. A "Great" deal  for sure and I'd recommend to anyone.
3,it is a nice case just wish it was easier to stand up.
5,Love this case. It arrived in a timely fashion and fits my nook Simple Touch perfectly. The pleather is soft and does not seem to interfere with the use of the product. I haven't had any problems with use at any rate. I will definitely look into ordering other colors from the same company in the future.
4,very easy to use and flexible  when they are too stiff it is a pain to try and work with.
4,The case is perfect. My Ipad air fits perfectly in it. The corners are definitely protected. The quality is really good.
1,2nd battery i purchased. ..1st one lasted 2 yrsthis one lasted 2months and the battery life is less than 1.5 hours after ourchasing July 14th 2020. .wi dow closed to return it on aug 26th 2020...today is Sept 23rdvery disappointed
4,bought it for my daughter's nook.  she likes the color. it fits well.  it is not slippery and easy to handle.
5,The product arrived as promised connected as described and allowed streaming of all channels through my Slingbox using the HDMI cable
5,perfect for my daughters new car stereo. It fit in place of one of the cigarette lighters so it looks like it was there from the factory.
4,I'm very happy with the product. My tv looks great on the wall.
1,I usually read reviews before I purchase anything in this case I did not wish I had.  It is horrible I tried many times to get it on its very difficult & so many bubbles I tried the cloth it came with even a credit card it just wouldn't work. I don't usually leave bad reviews because I'm happy with everything I purchase because I read the reviews. Do not waste your $ on this one.
4,Good item! Just make sure that you get all the bubbles out and every piece of fuzz or hair. Good buy
1,I purchased one and work great for less than a year before it could no longer supply enough power through the hdmi out.  Amazon replaced it after the return window closed but then less than a year later the replacement suffered the exact same problem.
3,did not work for what i wanted to use it for.
5,I have the converter connected between a Fios TV One Mini and my Slingplayer.
4,Received quickly.  Mounted to wall easily.  The TV attached securely to the mount. The directions were clear and easy to follow.
4,overall nice combo pack it includes everything you need for a100 which works out well when you are buying it for a gift.
5,These disks say 4X but I'm burning at 8X on my LG BE12LU38. I've never had a malfunction or burning issue. I use them primarily for burning data (backing up photos - I'm a professional photographer). I haven't burned any movies yet so I can't judge playability there. The actual recordable space on these is about 23GB.
5,Looks and works like my evga cables. Pretty good quality.
2,These came actually faster than i thought but there were a few bends in it. I got it for my mom who didn't seem to mind but if it were for me I'd pay more to get a better one.Twitter - @RooKata64
5,good quality
4,If you're hooking your lap top to your tv you want a longer one so you can sit where you want and still control the laptop
4,Good case especially for the price.  Absolutely no issues!  Color was accurate.
5,Appears to be sturdy and should be protective enough to store all my cords and plugs
5,Worked great to power a graphics card in a HP Z440 that only had two 6 pin connectors available.
3,Instructions make no sence. Extra parts in package that are not mentioned on instructions.
5,Good product it replaced original exactly.  Tools worked great. Not too sure about the triangular picks but I didn't need them. Would order again.
3,It's ok but I have a leather case that is superior to this one
4,Sturdy and handsome.  For me the hand grip on the back and the stand-up support are not useful.
5,Even though it has some setting buttons. The device configured itself automatically.
5,I really like the look and feel of this case.  Looks like leather and is very sturdy.  It has openings for the charger plug in and you can use all adjustment buttons without remover the case.  I feel it definitely helps protect my Kindle.  Great product for the price.
5,Es una herramienta muy práctica para los viajes y para guardar todos los cables y accesorios que uno transporta buena calidad del material.
4,I chose this rating because it best described my evaluation of the utility and versatility of the CaseCrown Standby Case.
1,I purchased 3 cords  I'm building a new house and installed 2 in the wall of my house and used 1 in my camper . The one I used in the trailer is defective and will not work properly it carries sound but no picture. Hoping the ones I installed are good . I guess we will see when the house is done .
4,Easy to connect. Had to set the display Coles to get them to match the laptop. Once that was done it was easy
4,They work and they are cheap.  You don't need expensive cables to carry a digital signal a distance of six feet.
4,I like it because it's very easy to use and you don't have to hold the kindle all the time
4,This cover is perfect when you have kids that play games and watch movies there to protect it from accidents!
4,Good deal here. Still getting used to a case over my tablet but the functionality is great. Glad I bought it.
4,I have not tried the ridiculously high priced screen protectors but I don't know what advantage they would have over this one.
5,This case is fine for the Kindle I bought it for. I am probably giving this Kindle away to a friend but I have similar cases on my other devices and love them.
5,Exactly what it says it is fits perfectly because the M.2 threads are universal.Note; this is for desktop motherboards don't try to use this for laptops without research.
5,I was really expecting a cheap old case. but the case is made of decent material. the accessories that came with it works really well with the tablet i was actually surprised the hdmi cable worked really well with my tv. the screen protector protects my tablet pretty well.e
4,could have been a little more sturdier and able to access buttons a little better but overall a fair case for price
4,this product workd well was hooked up to a ps3 to get hd on the tv while playing games we love it!
5,Perfect and has no feed back or popping when using on my amp
5,The package came quickly within the seller's timeframe. Two HDMI cords were included. They work great and have thick cords like the more expensive cords. All in all  this is a great product and the price and high quality cannot be beat. If youre having a hard time making a choice choose this product
4,Nice quality for the price.  Good protection would buy again.
5,Great cable works from my tv to a subwoofer
2,Never worked for my older Compaq laptop. This product is NOT a converter. Ended up buying Video Secu PC to TV converter. I recommend that product if you are trying to display what is on your computer onto a  CRT TV.
5,I love this case. This is actually my second one. It fits the kindle nice and tight and has a nice look to it. The magnet feature that turns it off and on works well. Overall a great case if you want something that looks nice and fits right
4,this fit my new Nook perfectly and is an awesome color.  Definately not wrried about damaging my nook at this point
5,Love this amp I switched out the tubes to a black glass kenrad vt-231 and power tube as the tungsol 5998 awesome sound.
4,Would have liked more instructions on the correct way to apply it and maintain or change it. Are instructions available?
1,Garbage product.  Lasted for about a month and ended up in the trash.  There was something wrong on the phone end of the cable and if the phone moved it would disconnect from the radio.  Cannot recommend this cable.
1,I was not happy with this screen protector.  It was shipped from China in a flimsy envelope with no cardboard to protect it from bending.  I waited a long time to receive it and when it finally arrived was bent in several places and would not fit on my iPad 2 properly.  I did not pay much for it but was not able to use it due to damage in shipping.
4,The item was easy to put. I had never put a protector by myself and this was easy. Good stuff!
4,Very easy to put on your Ipad it has the holes in the right positions. Very satisfy with the item.
4,recommend the product is absolutely perfect and original responsible and sent within the stipulated time without any problem! thanks for serving
1,Bought two. Both of them work only intermittently. They produce a fault that makes my iPhone say the cable is wet and there is moisture in the lightning port. If I use a different aux cable with an adapter it works fine.
1,Does not work as advertised on M2 to bypass the copy protection while using HDMI.  Total waste of money.  Slingbox app will only work if you disconnect the HDMI cables from this adapter which totally defeats the purpose of buying this adapter.  Using DirecTV.
4,great item I just plug the other end with a s video cable and boom my laptop screen was on my tv!
2,Try and install this battery with no instructions! At least give a YouTube address. Plastic tools are crap!
5,I am so happy with this case for my new Nook with Glowlight; it is comfortable to hold and does a good job of protecting the Nook when you want to take it with you somewhere. You can also fold the top cover back when reading plus the magnetic closure works very well.
1,I have already sent you an email on how unsatisfied I was with this product.It was very cheaply made and could not hold my iPad.  There was little to no protection on the corners.I was upset in that when I tried to get a refund it did not allow me to do so.Can you please refund me back what I paid fo this?Thank youIris Colan
2,The shipping and the price of this protective screen were great.  Unfortunately adhering specifically to application instructions we were not able to apply the screen bubble free.  Perhaps including more than one screen in the order would be helpful.
5,OMG - an affordable class "A" OTL headphone amplifier that is just badass awesome for the money.  Every audio enthusiast should own one.
4,I love it.  I'd give it another star if it had another propped angle postion.
1,I bought this specifically to continue to use my slingbox since upgrading my TV to a virgin Tivo which only has HDMI output - no scart.  With all the component cables correctly connected I can transmit sound but not picture.Finally got it to work with a much cheaper HDMI splitter and composite connection.
5,Other than the usual problem of removing the case the battery fit as well as the original and is performing very well.
5,Works just as it should. Does it's one job perfectly.
5,My daughter loves her iPad cover. The fit is perfect and it's really good quality for the price. And so far the Apple Pencil and magnetic case (included) have not been misplaced - whew!
4,Was what I needed.. I like the way the pocket works for the device
4,THIS WALL MOUNT WORKED WELL WITH MY TELEVISION SET.  IT WAS EASY TO MOUNT AND MY TELEVISION FITS WELL ON IT.
5,Good product/good service a bit pricey but a great alternative to monthly fees. Connected seemlessly!
5,I had went to B&N  all they carried to fit my Nook was a thin plastic flap type cover that clipped to the side then folded over to cover the screen. It was $23. I love this cover I received from you great protection. Pretty color. Excellent price. Thank you!!!
5,This worked perfectly in our tech panel at home.
3,Five years and it still works great
4,Great love it! Just had to clean stick and it's done. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family.
5,Worked as described and worked for the slingbox SB500
2,First of all the colour of the case was much lighter than shown in picture. Secondly this product is made of a very cheap material. It does not stand to being perfect. Makes the Nook simple touch look really big.
4,This shipped quickly was a competitive price and worked well not much more to say so I won't say it..
5,When I saw the price for this case I thought i'm just gonna try it since it's so cheap. If it is bad I can just buy a new one but this is the best case ever. Very well  made and fits the kidle fire perfectly. This is a great buy.
5,Worked perfect for my Slingplayer when I upgraded to Fios TV One.
5,Great case for $5 just can beat it....there is no need to over pay for a case the $$$ I saved can go toward the great stuff I like to buy on Amazon...only thing I wish it had a place to hold a stylus but you can't have it all I guess.
4,It's a screen protector--not much to say about it. It was exactly as I expected it to be. Good value.
4,i like this a lot. this meets my expectation. thanks for the this product. i'm satisfied of this protector. .
1,Didnot work!  I connected to a laptop's vga out (which worked to a TV that had a PC input through a vga cable).I changed out the vga cable connected the vga-to-svideo converter and ran svideo to the same TV's svideo input and it woud not display- bummer!  BTW the svideo of the TV works fine thru other sources.the only thing i only lost a few dollars trying this.
4,Performed as advertized
4,The cables work great. They are thick and a little bit stiff to maneuver but I like the sturdy feel.
5,Great. Just as advertised
2,Worked well for almost two months but seems to have died and I don't see any way to contact support.
5,I am very pleased with this Kindle case. Honestly I wasn't expecting it to be as good quality based on the price but now I see that it's a quality case at an affordable price that I can definitely appreciate. I think you will be pleased with this one if you buy it!
4,Nice product. Fits like a glove.
5,Battery was a perfect fit and all as expected. With the videos on YouTube replacement was a breeze using the tools supplied. Thanks.
5,This works well and allowed me to place the HTPC (a tower not a special case in my entertainment center) to be placed under the table next to my chair for easy access.  No noticeable loss of quality to the picture at 25' so I'd say it works great.
1,This broke three third time it was used. It sounded great. I don't know if I just got a dud but it is in the garbage can now! So... Not really worth the money
5,Easy install and I got many more channels that I was receiving before install
4,To use the stand part it is a little difficult to get it to stay.
4,Nice case
1,the screen protector had some deep wrinkles in it straight out of the package.  I kept it because I did not have one and did not want to use my Ipad without one.  The screen protector did not stick well and everytime I have to use it I find myself having to  retuck the screen protector.  My first one never acted this way.until it was very old.
2,Felt like heavy duty well constructed I guess but it didn't recognize my laptop to my tv
5,Works great.
4,Looked great delivered on time it was the wrong size and had to return
3,It was ok
2,This product was very inexpensive but may not be for everyone. Be prepared to cut the mounting bracket with a hack saw and go buy the right size mounting screws because that is what I had to do.
5,I bought this for my son's Nook he received for Christmas. It is exactly what we needed! It fits perfectly with the Nook very durable and since it's bright green it's easy to see when he loses his Nook. I will definitely order more products from eForCity! Great service and products!
3,note: wount stand portrit
2,This item was wrinkled and bent when I received it.  Very thin plastic and had two sticky spots to place it on the Ipad.  I took it off after one day because it distorted the screen.
3,Assembly was confusing but great for the price
3,Nothing special just a good price.
5,The absolute best cover for an iPad Air. This is my third CaseCrown iPad cover. It just fits really good with great four corner protection. The cover appears to be made from a simulated leather; what ever it is it just "feels great" . This case is just perfect !
3,Just to settings to hold it up...not enough!
5,well made fits just right and protects well (kids have dropped the ipad several times already)  the stand up feature is easy for all to use.  great product.
5,The case has been better than I anticipated. I had purchased a genuine Apple case and was not totally satisfied with it so I ordered the CaseCrown and it is exactly what it says it is. Especially when comparing prices this case is superior to the Apple case.
5,At first I thought the green was a little too bright. However once I got it and saw how well it fit my Nook it is fine and works very well. The price is perfect  at only $3.00 and change. A great deal on a very nice product!
5,This is just a plain awesome deal. The price is incredible shipping was extremely quick and item was just what it was suppose to be. The bonus part is the fact that you get to purchase this through Amazon! This gives you buyer protection and an excellent communication stream on your purchased product. I couldn't be happier.
4,Three feet turned out to be a little short. Cables are fine.
5,I purchased this product and actually it was more of a help then I actually thought. Great product to purchase....
5,Dumb that ASUS uses proprietary part you can't buy local anywhere/they also do not sell. Thankfully someone stepped up with a replacement.
5,I have purchased two of these.  The first one lasted 6 years.  High quality and will hold up to a great deal of use.  The price was excellent.
2,Had an old laptop and tried this to see if the laptop could use a TV for a 2nd screen could not get it to work but kept it because I was to lazy to return it.
5,Seem to have clean signal and pix.  No side effects on pix.
5,Perfect.  Had one channel tiling.  This resolved the problem and I was able to add the rest of the outlets in the house.  I'm using with a digital antenna on top of the house.
2,They sent me damaged products twice and finally I had to choose not to use it. They did not take my advice for charging a little more to improve their wrapping method. It does not make sense.
5,New front tower speakers have built in powered subs. Needed good quality "y adaptor" and cable this product supplied both at a reasonable price. I have ordered others with different length cable if I need to move the speakers. Cable and splitter at price of a good splitter this was a no-brainer.
2,I should have read the negative reviews before ordering this item. Impossible to get it on without bubbles.  Oh well I will make it work and next time spend the money to get a good one
4,Good mount for the price. Easy to install and use. I recommend it to anyone looking to hang a TV.
2,i like color...but the case is not snug to ipad. Because it does not fit right there is always a tendency to move up ipad to be able to select a button in lower screen.  Annoying!
5,It works well. The only negative were the detections. They were very difficult to follow. I figured the installation without them.
3,Too bulky and heavy
1,I got this one for my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and something was not quite right. The slots for the things like the charger didn't quite match up. Someone else mentioned this too in the reviews. I then went back to a case I got at Walmart that fits perfectly...even has a zipper. Also it took about three weeks to get this one in question. Go to Walmart.
5,I have an ASUS Z170M-PLUS motherboard. I lost my original M.2 kit. These did the job
2,Expensive and didnt fit my board a msi b450
4,Received the item as it was advertised the item is performing as advertised on Amazon and was in perfect condition upon receipt.
1,This product did not work to hook up my Laptop to a standard old projection TV.  You have to buy an actual converter box to xfer from digital to analog which this product does not do.  My roommate bought a converter box for about $100 and it works just fine.  Possibly if you have an HD-TV this may work but then just buy an HDMI cable.
1,We installed 9 tvs up to this thing.  After a few days we were getting weak signals on most televisions.  We completely wasted $50 on this junk.
4,Couldn't get this to work with my son's xbox. He was looking for a cord that would work with computer monitor.
4,this is a very substantial case. I appreciate the strap and multipostion stand
4,The thickness could be better but all in all it was under 4 bucks.
2,This is a basic cover.  I will keep it for a back up to the hard cover I just bought.  I am not facinated that I have to charge the Kindle throught the binding.
5,I ordered this product last week and it came in within 5 days! I put it on and had no air bubbles  it was easy to insert ! Great product for the price .i have the new iPad 3rd generation and the screen still looks good!:) I would recommend this product:)
5,I had originally bought a cover from B&N but that one kept snapping off and did not bend back easily. This one was so much cheaper and actually holds my nook since you slide it in as opposed to the flimsy snaps on the B&N one. I am extremely pleased.
5,Worked fine on Asus board. Surprising these are not more readily available and cheaper. Had to get it shipped from US to UK
4,i'm not a videophile so i wonder if hdmi cables truly vary? this one seems to do the job and i got it in 2 days!
5,Money saver! I have several Ipads and this case really works. I have not had an issue with discoloration or any other sort of damage. It is of good quality and I am glad I bought it.
4,This is a must have item Thank you for your help.
5,Works perfectly. Easy to set up.
4,Worked as advertised.
2,Claims to be an iPad Air but it is not a good fit. The camera hole is half covered up and also the power on button on the front is covered part of the way.
5,Excellent product I use almost every day in my karaoke taxi thank very much.
3,Magnetic closure doesn't always work.
3,thank you
2,It did not work.. I was a little suspecious when I ordered it. My VGA output on my computer worked to a Monitor/TV so I figured this would work. Neither s-video or yellow video worked.
5,Hooked it up and was able to enjoy my Slingbox. This item works as advertised.
4,I like the High Def quality that it produces when hookedup to the PS3 and thisk that it is the best
5,Dont spend a fortune on an HDMI cable. This one was cheap and get the job done just fine. The cable itself is rather small I have no idea if this affects the signal quality at all but I have it on my Apple TV so it doesnt need to be super high quality.
5,Very good.Actually received this..go figure.
5,I recently bought an Acer Iconia Tablet 100 but was dificult to find a case. So I run into this product while browsing at Amazon so I bought it. The case fits properly on my tablet and the other addtions ( headset stylus and cable) are  very handy
5,I use this on headphones to a metal detector. For this purpose it works fine.
5,Used to install M.2 NVME drive to MSI motherboard that did not come with a screw.  Worked great.
5,Yes the s item meets my expectation! Very useful and detailed and stands perfectly does no slide or slip . This is what I have been looking for. Will soon order another one.
2,Reduce video output 1080i sling keeps rebooting
1,The only good thing about this case is the magnetic cover that auto locks the screen. The tilt adjustments suck (don't stay in place) the access to the bottom of the screen (shortcuts) is blocked because the case covers where you need to swipe it's too slippery and I don't trust it to keep my iPad safe in the event of a drop. Would not recommend.
5,Worked perfect exactly what I needed to set up CB on my Jeep.
2,It won't hook a Macbook Pro up to a TV even with the VGA adapter. I still have to buy a $30-60 VGA converter box so it's not really what I thought it would be.
5,Was unable to hook it up. It fell apart before I could install it
5,Works with no flaws
1,Sometimes its better to spend a little extra... you do get what they say u get but its very cheap and cheaply made I didint even want to spend my time nor energy sending it back. Like I sy don't get me wrong its exactly what they say it is... I just wish i would've just spent the extra money and gotten something of better quality
1,This did not work at all for me and for the price I'm not too surprised. It wasn't dead on arrival but it was just generally a piece of junk. It transmitted a stacky image like the type that screams and hisses at you when you turn your TV to a dead channel and it just didn't seem to be anything else but a con. Don't buy.
5,The screw and standoff fit correctly and works as expected in my Asus ROG Strix Motherboard
2,This case looks good but causes my screen to freeze. I have to remove the  case and restart my kindle. The kindle works just fine until I put the case back on.
5,Carries all chargers and cables for Apple and Android products
1,Couldnt lay without many little air bubbles and tab didn't come off easy. They sent a second one I think because I received one in the mail without even contacting seller... But seemed too cheesy. The second was a little better but should have been sent the first time. Ended up going to Walmart for legit screen protectors which worked great. Who knew there could even be a difference.
5,There are CDs and then there is MAM-A.I use these for all my archival work.If you need the highest level of digital quality there is no other choice.
5,Good product!
5,When i ordered this product i thought i was getting something bland but when i got it it brought my tablet back to life and i feel as if i got a new tablet even though its a case
5,I wish the seller would spell "component" correctly.
3,Hard to install!
4,So far so good. Solid product. Fast shipping!
5,Worked perfectly.....used this for an old analog security system with rj-59 cable and BNC connectors. Was able to connect to a computer monitor using the vga port
5,Just what I needed for my sound bar.
2,It's okay but from time to time the image gets static. Not a perfect product.
5,I have not used the headset or HDMI cable yet but the case and screen protector are great. Both fit well and I love the extra protection. The built-in stand on the cover works well. The stylus is also handy at times. I would definitely reccomend this set.
5,Worked great on Xfinity 1 boxand slingbox 350 was able to power box from usb port back of Xfinity box.
3,As advertised
5,Great buy I bought red and it's fantastic.  I feel safe that my ipad is now in a case and is protected.  must buy  very happy with my purchase
1,Product worked great for 5 days. No loss in picture quality and component output worked well from HDMI converter. Unfortunately it just quit yesterday after working for the first 5 days. Lucky for me I’m still within the 30 day return window.
5,No problems. Connectors fit cable works.
2,Would not work properly as advertised...Could not stream video over 4G Data .....Item was returned.
4,This case is wonderful protection from any and every scratch
2,NOTE:  does not fit Acer laptops if you are installing a M.2 drive.  Crazy expensive for a tiny screw.
5,I really love my iPad Air case very much. The corners are very detailed and extra for. I will probably get another one later on perhaps in another color.
5,For the price this cable works great I've been using it for over a month now with no problems. If your in the market for an adapter cable for your subwoofer stay away from those over priced cables that are selling a name and go with this one.
5,Its been 10 months since we received it and just today has started to rip.  Not too bad for daily handling multiple times per day.  Great saturated red color
2,It mostly is good but there were bubbles that we could not get out no matter how hard we tried! I wish they would come out the bubbles get in the way.
5,PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT....everything fit like a glove on my Acer A100....I can even wrap the headphones around the inside of the case to keep them in place....the only thing I would add is a stylus holder on the case to hold the stylus...but other than that everything was PERFECT [:-)
3,Good value
3,good
1,I disliked the product after installation the metal was inferior to the first use and failed. Great that I can order it quickly but sad that it was of poor quality. I bought another brand that was stainless and haven't had a problem since.
5,It works. I don't think I can elaborate on this item.
1,I hooked this adapter up to my laptop and tried both the svideo and composite cable into my projector and neither worked. i tried hooking it to my tv next and again neither worked. i hooked a straight vga to my projector from the laptop and it worked just fine. also worked just fine vga to vga for tv. this adapter does not work.
2,did not work from my BNC to VGA but not sure if it was my fault because the instructions were missing..
5,have it for a couple of months now.  really nice feeling of the fabric fit perfectly the strong quimical smell goes after a couple of days.the plastic protector gives a really strong glare can't read it in sun but could be because of the screen
2,This protector was very poor in quality. Very hard to stick to the screen and in doing so got fuzz and finger prints on it. I ended up throwing it away.
5,Converting hdmi to 1080i for Roku to slingbox pro hd
5,great item & super fast shipping
4,Very nice case works well
5,Excellent!  I’ve got it stuffed with cables and adapters.
2,I don't like it it was wrinkle and bend!!!! I don't know if I can use it. I am not so happy about it. I hope they can send another one😔😔😔
3,great
4,shipped fast great buy
5,Love this product.  After I purchased it several of my friends and family have also purchased one.  I now have four of these and they are great for organizing your discs.  It also will keep them from getting scratched when storing..
5,If your having issues with digital signal this is the way to go
4,product is fine though deliver was apparently by pony express
5,There are higher speed USB cables out there but this one should feet all your needs unless you have to use 4000xsomthing resolution which i don't think anything of size less then house supports.check out this link[...]to decide if features of 1.4 are worth extra 30$ for you.
5,After trying different adapters this was finally the one I needed to get my GTX 1080i running on my computer. So I loved it.
3,Lol
2,it doesn't fit my i pad ...it covers the buttons I need to push.I am happy with the pouches that hold the i pad up.
5,Works fantastic!
5,Works great!! I was only getting spotty reception before installing this booster. After installation I 30+ channels clear.
5,I got this protector to go over the iPad at work while waiting on a cover so it wouldn't get scratched! Our iPad is now two years old and not a scratch would definitely recommend!
5,I admit it. I almost passed on this case because the price didn't exactly scream "quality" item. I was pleasantly surprised when I received it. This is a well made case and also attractive. This is one bargain item that will not be sent back!
4,Well designed as advertised.
4,Great value and great deal for the price.
5,Fit my Asus z170 Pro Series motherboard perfectly. It was hanging loose for a good year :)
2,I remembered I bought this item and I didn't review it; at the time it was ok. It broke very quick and easily though not long after I purchased it.
2,This ipad cover is appealing looks nice. It has good overall coverage for protection. However it's not as sturdy when being propped up.  My ipad slips out from positioning.
5,I ordered this for my boy. I installed it and it was perfect expect I redo it so many time I ended up with two tiny bubbles. But that's my fault and it's not so obvious when it's turn on. I'll say this is a good screen protector.
5,A little expensive for what it does
5,Product was delivered very quick and would've been in perfect condition except for one thing.. The mail person folded it in half to fit in the mail box!!! So It has a big crease down the middle.. No fault of amazon or the product manufacter.
5,Excellent tube amplifier very happy with it.  It sounds terrific for very affordable price.
5,Easy to hookup to my Slingbox 500works well.
1,It looks very nice and solid!...sadly it didn’t work.I couldn’t give it a listen ‘cuz one of the tube didn’t work. Customer support are nice and will answer quick enough.I paid next day delivery to get the DarkVoice.but replacement tube takes 7-10 business days.....I returned it.
5,I've owned this cable for quite some time now and I am very pleased with it. I've used it on a Sony Bravia HDTV (32 inch) and an Emerson HDTV (22 inch) with a Sony Vaio laptop and an Asus laptop. Everything has worked great and I don't have one complaint.
5,This amplified signal splitter solved my problem of a too weak signal in the far rooms of my house.  It was easy to install and does a great job.
5,Works as its suppose to. Screwed my drive down no problem.
4,Works great on the iPad Air... Great fit no problems
5,Was not worth the cost
5,Good buy great price
4,It arrived shortly after I ordered it. In mint condition and connected well.Thank you!  Robert
5,i still have it on my ipad and im glad i do because if i didnt my ipad would be dirty and i love the price probaly the cheapest price your gonna find and it works as a regular screen prtector
5,RECEIVED BATTERY QUICKLY & IT SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF LOOSING CHARGE FAST.
2,I thought it came with 3 screen didn't know it only comes in one.  If I know I would buy more instead just one and waste shipping cost.
5,It's the missing link to making my slingbox 500 work or a paperweight.
5,Great product
5,Got this for my wife and have found that she loves the way is can adjust to her needs.  Reading vertically watching a video horizontally.  Easy to rotate.  In addition she loves the protect it gives no more dented edges.
4,Was easy to install using the instructions
5,It covers my kindle perfectly.  I enjoy using the stand up cover to read outside.
5,The case is great. My Kindle fits nice & snug so it doesn't move around. I can fold it to stand up so I can relax while reading a book or watching a movie. You can't beat it for the price!!!
4,Great product for the price.Very pleased with IT.
5,This item was an easy mount. Very quick in installation. fit the television I had and with only four wood screws it was up in less the thirty minutes with the TV hanging and I was watching. I will recommend this item to any one.
5,I purchased this product for the iPad Air wanting affordable coverage and protection for the tablet. I couldn't be more satisfied and to date have absolutely no complaints. It fits well and the functionality for the product has been exceptional. I highly recommend.
2,This screen protector wasn't worth the money!  I followed the direction and while smoothing it out all it did was scratch the protector.  Wouldn't buy again!
5,Worked exactly as described
5,This case is the best for your kindle. The wake sleep magnet always works and the stand is easy to use on the back for reading or playing games.It makes the kindle easy to hold onto. I would highly recommend this case.
5,This is an excellent case for my Kindle.It looks great the magnetic on/off feature works very nicelyPeriodThank you
4,Good
5,I love my cover for my iPad! Fits well protects it and easy to find because of the color. The only thing is that I wish it seemed more stable when you try to stand it up. Its kinda flimsy.
2,Hard to put on many air bubbles. But Jeese it was 2.00.  So not much of a loss. Had it worked it would have been a bargain.
1,Battery would not charge I should have known when the battery came completely dead. Most new batteries usually come with at least a little charge in them. I am so disappointed.
5,crystal clear picture fast speed for internet as well
4,Very compact. Love the feel and color
4,Works fine.
5,Worked great for my Asus MB that came without the standoff screw.
5,I have had this for about a month and am very happy with it. It holds the Kindle in a standing position protects it and has spaces for the buttons in the right spots. Especially for the price it was a very good buy.
1,They have a film that flakes off under the #2 layer across the top of the ipad. Wipes off when you swipe your finger to use the ipad. Not something I want to give to my elementary students.They keep saying they'll get back to me when I ask to return them haven't heard from them now again for months.
5,HDMI cord works great so far I can hook my computer up all the way to my TV for movies and it gets the job done. At about 1$ a foot this things a steal compared to radio shack (which doesn't even carry cords in their stores this long).
1,Ii know or was only 2 dollars. But come on! I out it on and there were at lease 50 bubbles. No exaggeration. And it was peeling in about 3 days. I just ripped it off I was so tired of it. Invest  your money in an invisible sheld  At least they work and you have a warranty.
5,I love the eForCity Leather Case for Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch. It fits perfectly and I can still use all functions of the Nook. Also not overly large so it fits inside my purse. I have my books with me all the time.
5,This is my second iPad case. Had the last one for over 4 years til I wore it out and re ordered. Good product
5,Fit and allowed me to install my Samsung 960 EVO absolutely perfectly on my Z170-Pro board. Not sure how well it fits other boards.
5,Great replacement battery for this tablet.
5,It was used to connect my cable to sling box for viewing away from home
2,Im sure this works for someone but it didn't work for me; I was very disappointed because they had serviced me well in the past.  :(
5,Great deal - I used these  for TV and for audio am input selection.  Work great
4,lightweight and perfectly does the job
5,Why pay for an expensive cable when you don't have to. I tried this cable thinking that if it did not work then I am only out a couple $$ and would then try the more expensive cable. I don't have to as this cable works just fine.
1,The rca plug broke off in the middle of a video shoot.
5,I love it! The magnet on the my pen holder is pretty strong. I've never had a prob with it coming off my case. Overall I like it a lot. Ty
5,Just as described
5,Perfect for connecting SlingBox and CableBox (Xfinity X1) direct to Ethernet
5,Exact cord you'd spend $20 for at Best Buy. No one should ever pay more than a few dollars for these cords. Many studies suggest there is no discernable difference in the performance of these cords and as far as I'm concerned that's true.
1,The screen protector arrived in a simple manilla envelope which was bent when it arrived so the screen protector has bends and divits in it which prevented it from laying flat on the ipad.  Needless to say I was unalbe to use it so it was a waste of money!  It took forever to arrive as well.
4,Great product
4,Its good made with competitive price.
4,fits well.just what I wanted!
5,Good product
5,Slightly expensive but fits the hole and holds the SSD in place
5,This screen protector is just as good as the ones you would buy in the store for triple the cost.  Easy to put on the ipad just a pain to get all the "bubbles" out (as with any screen protector).
2,While the case is durable and protects kindle there is no way to access on/off button.or sound buttons . So ultimately it proved to be unusable.
5,Great purchase.  I was very satisfied with the courtesy and efficiency of the seller.  The item arrived quicker than expected and along with the purchase is a YouTube link to better assist you on the installing of your screen protector.
5,Works great with my new gpu
5,Got this for my mom's ipad.  It is super nice and offers quite a bit of protection to her ipad.  She loves that it "wakes" it and puts it to "sleep" just by opening or closing the case.
2,I thought it would have fit the screen better its a little to small but good for keeping everyone prints off the screen
4,good protection & value
4,descent made for the price
5,Perfect for what i needed.
1,I received this in the mail bent essentially making it useless.  Being that they only ship ONE I had no  choice but to attempt to place it on my iPad.  The quality is pretty poor and the cut out is also off.  Overall this is a waste of money and time.  Look elsewhere.
5,I really like this case it fits my Acer a100 like a glove the screen protector it's great too. The stylus seems cheap and I can't make it work but really don't need to. I haven't tried the headset or the hdmi cable.
4,Just fine
1,it's cheap enough to take the chance but don't buy this if your laptop or desktop doesn't have a TV Out function built in because it won't work. it's cheap enough that the hassle of shipping back is not worth it. so it's off to the drawer for this adaptor.i would not recommend buying this unit.
4,Could be a faster speed.
5,I have an Asus Z170 Pro Gaming motherboard and this worked just like a charm!
5,Works great and improved picture quality.
5,Exactly as described
5,Great price easy to install
5,Perfect fit like the fact that you can remove the stylus holder off
1,this thing is a joke. I didn't think about it before buying it but unless your video card converts sample rates hz size and all that other stuff this will be useless. Most people looking at this are trying to find a cheap scan converter. This is not that product! don't waist your money.
5,I have purchased 3ft and 6ft HDMI cables and I'm completely satisfied with the way they perform. Highly recommended.
5,Cable was better than advertised. Instead of plastic sleeved it was braided nylon. Also has terrific gold plated connectors for a great quality picture. Very very happy I bought this cable.
4,sturdy no issues. good price
5,Well it's an hdmi it's plastic it works and there's really no downsides.Is there anything else you really need to know?
5,Horrendously expensive screw/standoff but if you need one there is really nowhere else to find one...Works perfectly.
5,I was a little bit leary about buying this at the price I got considering how much they are at Wal Mart but it worked perfectly for my 42 inch Phillips Flat Screen.  Was shipped promptly and recieved in excellent condition.  Would definatley recommend.
2,Unfortunately it does not appear that this cable is compatible with my EVGA graphics card and my dvd vcr  player
2,shipped fast but did not work for me like I was hoping it should have. was not really happy with that.
5,Easy to hook up
1,This product is a phony adapter.  VGA cannot be adapted to RCA component not without a device to decode and re-create the signal.  Tested this cable and nothing happens.  I should have used me brain before buying this though you cannot convert a 15 pin connection to 2 pins without an intermediary converter device.
5,Great product
2,laptop has tv-out. cord does not work correctly. when plugged into laptop tv shows 3 parallel black and white fuzzy images.
5,Great for the price very inexpensive. Second one I have purchases
5,A necessary cable for my new video card—Mac Pro tower.
5,Bought to work with my sling box and works perfectly
5,The Case Crown Case arrived very quick only two days.  It fits like a glove and the price cannot be beat.  All the cut outs are right where they should be and the case is substantial but light.
4,Great fit well made.
5,This is a great case. It is high quality even though the price is $5.09. I would have had no complaints spending double the amount. I have had no problem standing my Kindle up as others have reported.
2,the material that this was made of had an offensive smell.  Not sure if it was the leather or coloring/dye.  couldn't use
5,I have purchased significantly more expensive wall mounts in the past but was extremely pleased with this purchase for the price. It was incredibly easy to mount and appears to be very sturdy. I would certainly recommend this product.
4,Great item
5,I really like this case. It is classy looking and has the proper areas cut out for charging and speaker.
5,This worked good on my TVS
5,I bought this cover for my mom for Christmas. She loves it using the back camera can be awkward at times because the screen cover flips over and covers it but overall great quality and the red is beautiful.
2,It was only $2 no sense returning. If you need this send me a self addressed pre-paid envelope and I'll give it to you.
5,Just as described. Works better than expected.
4,GOOD AND LOW COST.
4,Not bad
5,The Case Crown case for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9" is exactly as it appeared in it's add. It functions as advertised and for the price was a very good buy. I would definitely recommend to others.
2,Does not work on a computer monitors  for hook up to a tuner box to create a cheap tv
5,Works great when you have 2-3 different gaming systems that you want to play and can't change them from the back each time.
5,It’s a hdmi cable it works and is long works for the job if you need the length
5,I love it!!! It is so nice to have my Kindle automatically turn off and on. And I don't have to fumble around for power button.  It stands up nice and it is easy to hold.
4,ok
5,Excellent case. This is the second one I've bought (the first one was for my kindle HD 7).  The fit is excellent with all buttons easily reachable. The device fits snugly. An all around good buy.
5,the adapter worked great on my HD tv but on my old tv the video wasn't supported. It was because my tv was too old and could not lower the refresh rate on my laptop enough to be compatible with the tv. Great product
5,Great holdereasy to hold and close and install
5,Works great exactly what I needed in my bedroom. Angles great to avoid glare from any angle
5,A PERFECT FIT FOR THE KINDLE 8.9. WELL MADE AND HEAVY DUTY. EXCELLENT CASE FOR THE MONEY!!
5,After really prompt delivery I got my iPad case. It was exactly as advertised. It fits snugly looks good and is light weight. Perfect. Will look for other things from Casecrown.
5,works with cdg which is what i needed this for
5,Snapped right in and worked as advertised.
5,Easy setup and works as it should.
5,Works great saved me fed from buying a new tablet
5,Wish these were stocked locally. Have needed these twice for Nvidia GTX 1070 installs in HP workstations.
5,Get fit secure and access to all buttons and charging port
4,i like it
5,Been a couple months and it works well enough. Easy to install holds consistent charge doesn't overheat.
5,Why not protect your tablet?  This is a very decorative shell for your device. Stand up and don't be constantly letting your tablet slip out of your hand and get damaged or worst ever have it destroyed..
2,It is a very ship material and it did not got to my home in very good conditions.. I would not recommend this
4,A good product
1,The item looked as if it had been ran over showing some damage to the wire. I have not been able to get it to work with my system as of yet. It also took over a month to get. I didn't realize that it took the slow boat from China.
1,I purchased this cable to connect a MacBook Pro (late 2012 model / MacBookPro101) to a Sony VPL-FH30 projector.  There was no signal even at the lowest resolution.I also tried it with an externally-powered repeater (Monoprice 7700) — that enabled an image to make it through but it was noisy and glitchy.
5,This is some solid cable! Very thick and seems good. RCA Plugs mate nice and easy.
1,Did not work at all. Bought to use with wireless headphones tried every way to hook up and still could not get any sound from speakers. And yes the speakers work.
1,This was not for the Nook because mine wouldn't fit in either on of the two I bought. What goes with doing this I have to pay for it to be shipped and then to return it to the seller.  I'll be very uneasy ordering from your people again someone didn't do their homework.
5,I was a little suspect to try these cables at such a low price but I'm using them with pretty high-end gear (1080p) and everything works great at a fraction of the lowest price for these kind of cables in my local area.
5,I purchased this adapter because I wanted to connect to a video proyector thru a S-video cable instead of a VGA cable. It worked perfectly both times I've used it.I strongly recomend it for those who prefer this type of connection.
5,I have been happy with this case! I have had it maybe a month! I love the way it protects my iPad Air. I have the red! Just ordered black! Wish I could have gotten it in white!
5,Perfect fit
5,Using these cables for my home theater subwoofer.They work just fine the low-frequency sounds emitting from the subwoofer when watching movies or netflix at seriously loud volumes do not suffer from any signal loss it sounds full no rattling or buzzing.
5,Fits perfect looks rich and protects my iPad from me dropping it. The stand is better than cases I've had before because it actually works.
5,It does improve picture quality
1,Cord went “bad” in nine weeks. Very light use in bed at night especially these last nine weeks.Believe me I did complete “elimination” testing and results: the Cord.
5,Woks with SlingBox
5,What we expected
2,worst screen protector i have ever bought. it came bent it was impossible to put without any air bubbles.Great disappointment.
5,I use it for connecting Bnc to vga monitor. Took 10 seconds to install. Didn't need directions. Does exactly what I wanted.
2,The screen protetor was place in a regular envellope and it was bent when I received it. The screen protector was damage.
2,The materials came in scratched and creased. The company sent another set quickly but the product is too rigid and dings/dents easily.
5,Many stores want some crazy price ($30 from my local Wal-Mart) for a single 6 inch cable but all you need is this! I have had the cable for a few weeks now and it works great no problems at all.
5,Great product and a vital part of my cut the cable plan.I used the cable jack in an un used bedroom to power the unit.
1,I connected the cable to my computer and other end to TV. Nothing happened. TV said no signal. I connected another HDMI cable and TV connected my computer. I am returning the cable.FocupixHDMI to HDMI Cable -High quality gold plated. HDMI 1.3 for In-Wall Installation 40 feet
5,Can't say much more besides great deal!  Used this to hang our 90+ lb. Samsung plasma tv and it worked like a charm.  Seems very strong and well built.  I would buy another in a heartbeat.
5,It works
5,Very good
4,Nice case
5,Exactly what I expected to go from my laptop to my 50 inch TV...  I am very pleased thank youRick Johnson
2,Unfortunately this item was not compatible to my tv.  It may work for the newer flat screens.
5,Worked like a champ
5,The CaseCrown case for the iPad Air fits well and hardly affects the size or weight of the iPad. I like the velcrow flap that secures the iPad from slipping out and all controls are easily manipulated.
2,This was priced well put I ended up peeling it off about three months after I put it on. :(
5,I love my case for my Kindle.  I had bought a cheaper case earlier and even though it worked fine I was impressed with this case because it is genuine leather and should last a long time.
2,Not what I expected.  Cheaply constructed 😕
4,GOOD FIT!
4,works well
5,Thank you for your follow up.  The product is great its unfortunate that I cant use it  as its the wrong size for my kindle but your service was great. Thank you.
5,Worked fine but was not the problem with the devise.
2,Leather case cutouts not design properly therefore there is fitting problem and Stylus pen is also not working properly as well
5,The case is a little funky to stand up but that might be because of the new material. Hoping once it loosens up it will get easier. Received it on time though
5,Well made case. The price is right and it came in 2 days. And here are my seven more words
5,This Mount bracket is very strong great quality and would hold your big screen TV very well.I love the company. They took great care of us excellent customer service friendly stuff.Thank you again and Happy Holidays to you all!
2,THIS IS AN ADAPTER NOT A CONVERTER so it does not do what I wanted it to.
5,The device appears to be well made. The connectors seem to be of good quality and deliver the signal without degradation.
5,Perfect just as described
5,all you need to know
4,As discussed
5,Just as expected not much to it it works as needed
5,Case is well made and fits perfectly. I doubted the pen holder but when placed on the cover near the end where magnets are it's very secure.
5,I bought this male to male hdmi cable so I could hook my laptop up to my new Vizio 1080 p tv.Works great only had it for a few days but I'm happy with this investment.- G
5,What can I say great price and great quality!. Merci.
5,After I ripped the box that my nook came in I realized that I could use a case to house my nook. Seeing as green is one of my favorite colors I got this case and it works well.
5,I bought this case because the one I had for my Nook did'nt close so things in my purse would fall in between the screen.  This case was just what I needed it helps that it looks good too!
5,The cover fits my iPad like a glove. The color red is simply gorgeous. I love it. The quality is very good. I give it 5 stars.
2,This is not a custom fit by any means. You have to undo Velcro closure to charge. Not the best.
5,Good
5,I purchased this for my wife and she really enjoyed it.  This is a good product and we have purchased 2 of them.  I.e. very durable making it the most important protection for the Kindle.
5,Good value!
5,easy hook up
5,I really like the case you can charge the kindle with the case closed which I couldn't do with my old one. The shipping was fast and the quality great. I would recommend.
1,The material pad that it came with to wipe the screen got tiny fibers on the screen that got stuck on the screen. When the cover was applied there were tons of tiny bubbles. Just plain bad product. I will go to the apple store and let them apply it for me.
4,Good
1,This should have a statement saying it only works with digital signals and will not convert VGA to RCA Analog for TV's. In addition it would be nice if the BestBuy affiliate would allow it to be returned in store. I should have done more investigation up front.
5,Bought this like 4-5 years ago. Still working great! Even with my many moves!
5,Perfectly solution for my issue; clean look
5,I had one of the more expensive cases for my Kindle Fire but I got this one for something different. It turns out I liked this one much better!
5,Even nicer than I thought. Fits nice and snug. The kickstand in the back is great. I always bought the ones with slots...this is so much better.  It feels much more compact and protected!!!
5,The product arrived on time and improved the visual output of my Wii. immensely. This item is a must for anyone who plays racing games or sports games that require tracking of objects on a viewing screen. Thank you.
5,Case is great.  It did smell funny when I first opened it but after a day or so  it was fine.  I really like the way it covers the whole iPad.
2,I am not pleased with this purchase.  It makes the iPad screen very dark.  Would not recommend.
5,Na
1,I have purchased things from Amazon over the years and this is the first time that my card/fiances card is turned down. Money in the bank and you Amazon do not want it.I will go to Best Buy they have what I am looking for.RegardsRon Arnold
4,:)
5,Highly recommend.
5,It was easy to fix. Package arrived via USPS in a don't fold envelope.I managed to place the screen protector with just one air bubble.. I have to see how far it holds well as time goes.
1,Very disappointed. First one never worked (had sound but no picture) sent it back they sent a new one VERY quickly but it still doesn't work i.e. the same issue with regards to no picture.
5,Good price shipped and arrived promptly good quality is what it's supposed to be and does what it's supposed to do. What else can you want from a cable? Two pack simplifies having cables around when you need them.
5,I've had this product for five months on my iPad and so far it has not peeled off. It is even easy to wipe off if you get any debris or food on it. Will be purchasing again.
5,Just did what was expected.
2,Ridiculously expensive for what it is.
5,Picture Quality is very good
4,Great
5,Exactly as promised
5,Great case. It does a great job of protecting the iPad without getting in the way. It's lightweight and very durable. My kids have dropped my iPad a few times and the case protected it beautifully.
1,This item does not work on most computers. I tried to use it to be able to run my computer to my TV and it would not give the correct signal. i found out later that most (90%) computers will not be able to work this way.
1,This cover which was supposed to fit an iPad for a 9” x 7” iPad. It was 3/4 of an inch too small. I was very disappointed because it was a beautiful cover. Don’t know how to avoid that happening.
5,Excelente
5,Works period
4,Welldone
5,Product has been in use for several years and has worked perfectly.
5,As what i expected good
5,It is a great value.  It fits the Nook Simple Touch nicely and it appears to protect the Nook from ordinary wear and tear.  I do not believe you can beat it for the price.
5,Love the case!  Protects the entire I pad and corners!  Love my red color choice!
4,Helpful.
5,This product is great. Just got mine today. Fast shipping. When it on very easy and nice. If there's bubbles then just take something like a credit card and scratch them out. I am very happy with it.
5,I like the case and the way it protects the corners.  It is exactly what I wanted and I would buy it again.
5,so i was easy to install...i ended up with like 30 bucks of extra hardware...but my TV is definitely on the wall and just where i wanted it.  super down with the price on this.
5,Yes this is a good option to the higher priced Alternative.  The case/cover is sturdy! Only wish the fold at base had a little more room for freestanding usage! But overall a good choice!!!
2,Does not work with router
5,Case is high quality. The physical color matches the color online. This happens more than you would think. I would definitely refer this product to a friend.
5,I think this case is a super good deal! I would expect to pay more to get the quality of this case. Very happy with it!!
5,Overall am very pleased with the combination and quality of the items. Will recommend it to anyone. Added to that the fact that you get five pieces of items for this reasonable price is an excellent deal.
2,Item was poorly protected. It did not work as described leaving bubbles when applying to The iPad
5,For the money I thought it would be some flimsy cover but to my surprise it equals and surpasses the high dollar covers ....We bought another one for our other kindle...fits them like a glove.....
5,Works as advertised.  Cleaned up picture.
5,Went to Best Buy Target Apple and was under or unimpressed. This one does what it says and is just what I needed and wanted. Nice color too with very rich feel to it. Perfect!
5,It fits my Kindle perfectly and also protects it very well. It has a magnetic catch to the cover to keep it closed and it plays the "elegant" part well in a solid black!
5,I love this case.  It fits perfectly and protects my iPad from damage when I drop it. When you close the case the iPad screen shuts off!
1,Even if your computer has a tv-tuner the drivers and the capability you can not just change the tip of the adapter and expect it to work. This product would never work (and you still need the same gender sided cables to plug into the device.)
5,Love this and so happy I have finally hung my TV I dont know why I have waited so long.
1,Did not last one month before starting to peel back on the edge and continuing to roll back and not sticking.  Could not even smoothly put it on without it bubbling up.  It came with a smoothing tool but it did not completely take out all bubbles.
1,I was only able to get some what of a picture out of the S-video port and when it was displayed on the tv it duplicated the image in 3 rectangular bands and not in full color. The yellow vga port didn't display at all.
5,I was very pleased with my purchase.  It was top quality and fit my iPad perfectly.  Well worth the price.A happy customer.
5,Works perfectly.  It is connected in my attic and sends the signal to 4 TV's throughout the house.
1,Apparently this device is not enough for Windows 7 or XP to communicate with devices via S-video.  Perhaps it works fine with an OS that's older or with Linux or Apple but that makes it pointless for the majority of users.  Like me.
5,Great case.  Durable stylish and functional.  This is my second one of the exact same product.  First one lasted about 4 years.
5,This is a GREAT deal I mean 1 screen protecter from Best Buy is 35$ and this one was 1.95 I'm just gonna take this to best buy and have them put it on my iPad:)
5,Purchased for grandson he is happy with case and accessories. He likes the case and folding stand (when playing NFL football 2013!) Case fits great allcutouts are properly placed. Only complaint is that darned protective screen!
5,Excellent quality.
5,I wanted a mount that would hold up my tv and work. It does just that. No problems no malfunctions you just will need larger size holes in the wall than the instructions say.
5,This is just what we needed to protect our iPad air especially when our children are using it.  It covers the sides and corners well and I love all the color choices available.
5,Buy this for a client so far no complaints everything is perfect and running at full capacity 100% recommended for anyone looking to buy from this seller Thank you for your good pruduct.
1,I hooked it up and immediately regretted this purchase. I connected my Blu-ray player to my TV with this cable and the picture would constantly cut out.  It would work for a few minutes then the picture would disappear....not happy!
5,This is a really great case! It is super well made. I've had it for several months now and use it every day. It is holding up to daily use very well. Highly recommend.
1,It took a long time to receive it  and the packaging terrible  (Just a mailing envelope with no protection).  The protector had no protection. - the envelope has no damage but the edges of the protector & lower section has "creases"... Not useable at all.
5,A problem with pads no matter who makes them is their fragility. the CaseCrown is an excellent solution. Sturdy protective without being bulky pleasant choice of colors competitive price. Well worth it!
5,Works fine
5,Works like a charm for my USB keyboard between 4 different platforms
5,This case is wonderful. It automatically turns the Kindle on and off when you open it which is helpful instead of having to find the tiny button and press it to turn it on.
5,eForCity 5 in 1 Black Leather Case with Screen Protector / Stylus...-Terrific value for my Acer Iconia 100-extremely pleased with quality& all the attachments-have not tried all yet so will update if necessary-but shipped timely
5,I love how this cover feels. I had ulama and couldn't stand it. It slipped and turned when it shouldn't. This new one is stable and a 100% improvement' thank you.
5,Great price works good so Happy with my purchases from Amazon!! Couldn't be more happier love and the stuff I find on Amazon for my Kindle! Will pass the word. Great place to shop.
5,It works fine
5,Great Case! This is my second one! First one lasted 4 years it was still OK just starting to look a little worn.
5,This item has a low price it came quickly and it works great.  This is cable will do the trick if you need to connect a Wii to an RGB TV.
5,took a while to receive via super saver shipping built in level on the unit super cheap price I would get another all these local stores ripping U off you can beat this pricing
5,My son uses his Kindle all the time. This case is extremely durable. It's perfect for a young child who doesn't care about how flashy something is. Great for a 9-10 year old!
5,The product is very good and works well with my new Ipad. It was also cheap. The only caveat is it takes a while to get the air bubbles out.I will buy again!
5,Amplify works
5,I got this to replace the "foggy" screen cover that my Griffin Case had "become."  Just peeled the old one out and slid this right into place.Thanks for a good replacement!!!
5,I purchased this to connect an older Apple laptop to my TV.  The TV has older and did not have HDMI inputs.  Cable worked great and was considerably cheaper than other alternatives.
5,Good item
1,I don't know how this product got so much reviews. For my experience it is the worst stuff I have ever got! Strong Plastic smell made me so dizzy. It is not slim at all. The color looks so cheap. Overall I am going to return it!
5,Closes securely and screen activates on opening. Fits nicely and stand position is just the right angle. If you're looking for a simple yet solid solution to covering your HD this is a no-brainer.
5,For the money it is an excellent quality and does exactly what was stated.  It auto shuts of the kindle when you close the case and turns it back on when opened.
5,Love this cover - bought it as a gift for my mom. Well made and light weight. It doesn't distract from the Nook and is easy to find because of its bright color.
5,I purchased the red cover and I'm very happy with it.  I like the automatic on/off and I like being able to stand it up to read a recipe or ??
1,Never received.  I didn't pay that much for it but I paid for it.  It would be nice to either get a r feud or to get the product I ordered.  I ended up having to buy another one from a different company
5,This is my third of these cases...first two for ipad2.  Simple light great colors.would be extra perfect if it had a little pocket in the liner for business cards or money
1,Shipping took forever and the back is exactly like the front.  It's not fitted or anything like that just the two generic holes they punched in the film.  The "back" does not for the the back because it was never made to.  Terrible
5,It does the job: good fit protective interior decent-looking exterior. It's leatherette not real leather and doesn't claim to be anything else. Priced very reasonably for what you get.
2,Worked great...until it didn't work the second day. I would steer clear in the future
5,Great case at a fabulous price!!  This case is so much more than I expected for the price. We paid  much more for other cases and like this one the best.
5,Perfect size and strong build quality. Highly recommend!
5,Fair priceNice looking well-made good fit for an Ipad air all the cutouts are in the right place and it arrived on time . What more could you ask for?
5,The case looks just the same bright green that it shows on the computer as it does in reality and fits nice and snug on the basic Nook. Great buy I'd say.
1,Bought two of them and it only lasted a month. First started to flicker funny then just quit power light was on but video quit working.
5,The quality is great. Very sturdy and easy to use. I like the magnet closurethats hidden. Other items included are very useful since the tablet didntcome with any. Received items quickly.
5,Best sounding entry level hi-fi OTL tube amp.
1,Don't buy this. Requires a VERY specific video card to be compatible and work. If you have the right card (check the fine print) then maybe it'll work. But mine is now helping me create my very own pile of useless crap.
5,It's the best cover I've gotten so far all the other ones fall apart in days.
5,Very Happy.
5,Great case & protection for  apple iPad Air .  Fits perfect. Very durable. Looks great  & viewing stand works great. Purchased  it on Amazon.com at a great price.
5,Not much to say works as it says and was super cheap. I use it mainly on my PS3 but will occasional hook it up to my PC for kicks. Works all around.
5,Antenna tv
5,This cover is a great protector of my iPad.  I no longer have a concern about the safety of it.
5,I like it could have more adjustments for angle but for the money a great value and seems to be well made.Arrived on time and fits like a glove.
5,I'm not sure that I needed the screen protector and you need to be careful installing it. But overall it was a GREAT PURCHASE for $8.48.  Don't pay much more than that!
5,Just what I needed to tame my constantly growing movie collection. Great space saver and makes retrieving movies easy. I Highly recommend this to anyone needing to organize a large volume of discs.
1,When plugging in any iPhone it says that there is water in port
1,Doesn't work with Gigabyte's x470 boards. I have the gaming 7 version and the screw is too small won't thread. Gigabyte's customer service is unresponsive about getting a new one. Not sure what to do now.
1,I have used this splitter almost every day since receiving it and literally 1 day after my return widow closed I now get an HDCP error with my Roku Premiere+. Unplugged this splitter and the Roku works fine.
5,This is a nice case and fits perfectly. I like how sturdy it is and excellent price!
5,It worked!!! As advertised. It worked. Great buy.
2,i try use with my wii but doesn't work
1,Product worked at first but was glitchy and seemed to work sometimes and would go out randomly. Was using in classroom for projector and worked upon installation but a few weeks later when classes started the cable failed completely and could not get to work.
5,I love this case.  It is sturdy and protects my Kindle fire HD.  It also shuts it down so to speak to save battery life as well.  Thank you.
5,All was as advertised
5,This is a very sturdy case that takes a lot of abuse! So far it's been dropped spilled on stepped on and it still looks new. Great case with a great price.
5,Good quality product
5,We bought this to try and control a TV on an enclosed porch and the box is inside the house.  Works awesome!
1,Is this some sort of joke? 7 dollars for a screw that is not even magnetic? really. I can barely fit this into my system because it is so minute.
5,need this to protect ipad.  this will work just great.  liked the price too.  no more mess fingerprints on screen. no just need to get to use it myself!
1,The product arrived with a cut/tear. Can i get a replacement ?The organizer nag look good. i want to get another one and let me know how i can send it back.
5,Worked like a champ right out of the box.
5,Beefy! Awesome for my in wall install for the outside tv!
5,Good
5,The replacement battery is good I have no problem with it.
5,Works well
5,Appreciate that!
5,Very easy to setup on the wall over my fireplace.  Adjusted to fit my flat screen TV well.  Solid product.  Love it and the price.
5,I bought this for my son's Kindle and he loves it! Great product for its price!
5,No issues. Expensive but the only viable choice without going to hardware store.
5,Great package for the Acer A100.  Items bought separately would cost over $50! Fast shipping. If you want a great case with a ton of bonuses you want this combo!
2,VERY grainy picturequality. Not even worthtrying to use.Buyer beware!
5,Got the job done
1,This case does not fit my iPad Air! It is to big and causes the camera lense to be covered. To bad because I had bought this for my old iPad and really love the old case. I wish I would of re
5,The size and material were perfect! Very nice.
5,this was for my grandmother it is the only part of the ipad gift that has not caused frustration on her part and mine
1,This cable DOES NOT WORK! It was supposed to be able to transmit whatever is displayed on my computer's screen through its VGA port to a TV. It does not work at all. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Waste of my money.
5,works great with the M2 Slingbox
5,I like the option of being able to hold it in your hand.  Case feels sturdy good quality.
5,My son really like this and we all enjoying it.  He loves it so much cuz he can do all his assignment on this....Thanks seller it was fast too.
5,So far I am completely satisfied with my new cover. I look forward to many yeasts of enjoyment with the Case. SincerelyJohn H. Kuhl CPCM
5,Beautifully crafted vivid color. Magnetic closure works perfectly. You can't go wrong with this case.The best case I ever had for an iPad (and this is my 4th)
5,I bought it for my wife's kindle fire great price for the product. also comes in other colors (not at the same price) but black is a nice natural color.
5,It was exactly what I wanted and the price was sure right! I was told to be sure to get a case that covers all corners and this one does.
5,For $4  this is without question the  best deal for a case for your 8.9" Kindle tabket.  It's in the at least $20 quality range probably higher.
5,Connected 4 tv's with each showing 57 channels from my antenna in crystal clear view.
1,Don't waste your money on this. It does not work. VGA to s-cable doesn't convert the pic so it works on the tv. Maybe an old computer it may work. But on a new computer it doesn't do anything.
5,nice product and reliable. we recieved it on time and have been used it since then.nice product and reliable. we recieved it on time and have been used it since then.
5,Easy to hang and fits most TV's.  Instructions were ok- could have used more explanation.  there are extra screws so you can fit the various sizes of TV's
1,I should have read all of the reviews better...  My purchase was a mistake do not buy this!  Signal kept resetting and did not work properly at all waste of time and $.
5,easy to install (make sure you have a good stud finder). cheap and works well I remember when wall mounts were 300 to 600 for a cheap one. can't beat the price
5,It works great.  Fits perfect.  Love the protection it goves from scratches.  I would recommend it for anyone that has a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch
5,Was looking for a cover that stayed in upright position without slipping and this cover does just that.
5,Love it 😍 for the price and looks.
5,Fits like a glove can't tell it on just clean your screen good first start in the middle get the bubbles out go to go lasts a long time
1,This product does not work. It is useless.
5,Fits great. Always leave my iPad Air in it and use it all the time. Color was red as stated and not (pink) like many items ordered. We'll satisfied.
5,I love how you close the cover and it shut of the tablet and turns on as you open it. Truly handy for me. The price was really great.
5,Great package for Acer A100 tablet.  Case fits perfectly.  Screen protector is good quality.  Cables stylus and headset work fine.  Recommend this package.  Can't beat the price.
5,Beyond my expectations for the low price.  High quality material everything included except tools and simple mounting instructions.  I had more trouble getting the old TV base off.
1,A simple screw and standoff for a ridiculously high price. I suppose the grubby little thieves must know what the market will bear.
5,The price was a steal now my iPads screen has protection and no scratches still like new. Easy to wipe off after little fingers have gotten to it. :)
5,This case has great balance on my chest while I lay in bed at night and sob watching reruns of the Flinstones I Love Lucy and the Dick Van Dyke show.
5,These are very nice.This is the second I have purchase for my wife's iPad.The first lasted for 3 years.
5,Bought this one as a gift liked it so much bought my self one. Nice fit  good construction like the auto off when you close cover.
5,I really like it it's handy and well made ...very good quality !!!
1,I received it pretty quickly and it looked to be fine however when I went to put it on no matter what I did the bubbles would not go away. So the day I put it on I also threw it away.
1,Does not pass multi-channel audio through to HDMI. Why would anyone want to sacrifice surround sound for the sake of using a slingbox?Useless product which was not clear in it's claims.
5,My wife loves that it stays open and it's easy to stand up. Not sure how well it protects the corners but I don't want to find out.
5,The case design is excellent and after several months of daily use is holding up very well. Nice corner protection. And the folding stand allows several different orientations.
5,Got these for under $10 and couldnt be happier great value for the money and seems to fit well on my new iPad Air 2 as well!
5,Classy look and great protection make this case far better than the one I bought a couple of years ago for my first Kindle.  I love it.
5,Product is sturdy and keeps the Ipad well protected.  I recommended it to other family members and friends as they were using it and also liked it.
5,Works perfectly and easy to install.
1,I ordered it because it claimed to be for ipad mini.  Instead of being cut to fit that device it was a large sheet which I would have to cut myself.  It is not even usable in my opinion.
5,They work awesome !!! Many reviews I read some where for and some against - I have to say there are really good and the price was right
5,This is the perfect cover for the simple touch ereader!! Love that it has the magnetic clasp to hold the front closed. Many don't have that. Great price and product!!
5,Exactly what Asus left out of the box!  Awesome TYVM
5,I've looked high and low and was excited to find this connector. It works as promoted and is perfect for connecting older components up to my video projector.
1,just terrible tried it on every computer i had all it kept transmitting were these blurry lines like how a nintendo looked if it wasnt hooked up properly got a replacement from the dealer still didnt work
5,This case was 1/3 the cost of anything else I looked at.  It fits well sits up well and does the job!  Would recommend this product.
5,Beautiful case.  It fit my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 just perfectly.  It's not flimsy. It's available in other colors but I picked black. I recommend it.
1,Would not charge in the original unit charger. Trashed it!
5,Love this cover for my son's Kindle. It's exactly as described and a little better than I expected especially for the price. It's very sturdy.
5,Very high quality I plugged it into my gtx 1080 it works perfectly.
5,PERFECT ... the right size - weight - feel.Great price - fast delivery ... if I get another Kindle this is tha case and place !!!
5,I really enjoy using this Stand by Case. You close the cover and it puts the Kindle HD 8.9 into standby. You open it tada.....it's back. It's Fantastic.
5,This was much cheaper than Best Buy.  For under $40 my TV is up on the wall and my son cant turn it off and on for hours. :-)
5,This is a very nice protective case with sleep mode built in when closed - great looking & great price - I absolutely recommend this product to everyone!
2,not meeting my needs.
1,I guess I have an older Fire in any evrnt the openings in the case don't match up with the openings on my Kindle. I'll keep the case but will have to cut holes for the speakers power cotd etc.
5,Great easy to insert ipad. Durable when it come to protecting it from when if you drop the ipad. good quality. It lives up to it's reviews.
5,Perfect for storage and organization.  This is the third unit I have purchased for myself and I have given three others as gifts.  I highly recommend them.
5,This was shipped quickly and I love the red color.  It feels like leather and I really enjoy that it protects the sides of my Ipad.
5,Very good buy. Not expensive and really protects my Kindle from the grandsons abuse.
5,Works as expected. Converts S-video from standard dvd players to vga to drive display.
5,I love it cuz it was fast shipping and right on time. Not really expensive like the ones in stores but works perfectly I'll recommend to anybody who wants to buy a hdmi cable.
1,Tried to hook computer to monitor the computer has been hooked up this way with another tv but no image and it took awhile to recieve I read bad reviews was hoping. I wouldn't buy it
5,This case was exactly "what the doctor ordered".  This case performs just as well and looks just as nice as the other way more expensive cases do.
5,No frills HDMI cable work exactly as intended and seem to be pretty high quality. Not much else to say about them if you need an HDMI cable these are great
5,Well made and thought out. Just wish it had more choice of colors.
5,Arrived on time fits kindle well. Love that closing the case turns off the kindle. Purchased at low cost compared to other cases sold would purchase again
5,Thank You!!!!!!!
5,This case is high quality especially for the price.  It snaps closed tightly and remains closed. I would definetly buy another one in a different color
5,it’s  very  good
5,This was absolutely perfect. It was just as it appears in the photos and exactly what my niece wanted. She got the nook for Christmas and this enhanced her gift beautifully.
1,VGA output was broken they maild me another but not the same item but the other item I bought with this adapter. Now I have 2 the same adapters with a s-Video and video/RCA cables adapter.
1,This mount specifies compatibility with lots of LCD televisions mine included. However what they did not advertise is the fact that it is in my case too tall for the tv showing the mounts above the unit. Very unsightly.
5,Case Crown Bold Standby Case (Black) for Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Inch Works Great and it also looks Good And also on the technical side it Fits very good
5,This amplifier fixed problems I had with HDTV reception based on transmission tower being over 40 miles away.
5,A great little inexpensive cover for my Kindle fire.  I bought some in different colors to change the look. Looks goog and has held up well under constant use.
5,Fits the Kindle perfectly.  All ports and speakers are open.  Should have got one along time ago.  And the price was right.
1,This item here was horrible. It did not work at all and it took 2 months to get here. Go get a working one for a higher price if you actually want one that works.
5,This case serves its purpose and the wake/sleep function is nice on it to. Has two positions that it can support while on a table. Works Nicely!
5,Been hanging around on the wall for a few years.  Holds a 55" LED tv now.  Easy to put up and take down.
5,I love my case the color was perfectand above all I love the function of the case . I would highly recommend this case .
1,0 stars!!!! I have not received my order. These are computer cables I need to fix my pc to work.
2,Doesn't stick as well as should.
5,I bought it on sale for 3.99 how could you go wrong for that price. I honestly wasn't expecting much for that price but it appears well made.
5,The scree protector fits perfectly the IPad 2 and protect it from often minor scratches. I bought 9 of them and for this price can' go wrong
5,Bought this for my new Kindle Fire HD. Looks good fit perfect and the open close on/off feature save battery and is a great option.Good product
1,This Product does not meet what I was looking for You can't remove all the bubbles and it's no better than not having it meaning it's just as much work to keep it cleaned than the screen itself.
5,Great buy
1,Was trying to plug my computer into an old TV. This cable didn't work at all - fortunately it only cost a few cents but now it just sits in a box of misc. cables.
1,Battery does not hold charge. Getting an error that it's unable to charge because battery temperature is too low. No attempt made by seller to fix problem.
2,Not good Quality
5,Great product
1,this thing did not work on any of the towers adapters or laptops. completely unable to produce a picture from either end of this crap waste of plastic time and money. (fortunately not much)
5,This is great. My 12 year old son uses it daily and it has served as a nice protection case for his nook.  Nice quality and quick shipment.
5,Cel.
1,BOUGHT THIS THING HOPING THE OTHER REVIEWERS WERE WRONG & DID NOT KNOW HOW TO USE THE PRODUCT. INSTEAD I GOT BURNED LIKE THEY REST OF THEM. IT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK AT ALL
5,I had no problems with this cable. I had to buy a "PC to TV Converter Box" along with this cable for the purpose I was using it for and it worked well with that as well.
5,I have now purchased several of these and they do the job. They go up quickly but use a level don't rely on the one built into the mount..
5,This is one awesome amp GET IT!
2,One came with a crease.
1,So I put this in my truck loved it for the 1 month it was installed. Now it won’t stay connected. Definitely needs to be more durable.
5,The case fit the kindle fire hd 9" perfectly. The shipping was a couple days ahead of the estimated date. I'm completely satisfied.
5,A bit pricey for just a cover but it does fit perfect with the new fire HD 8.9. It's hard finding the right one at the stores.
5,This is a quality case and fits perfectly.
5,Works great
1,I did receive the item very quickly but it does not work at all and the S-Video connector is misaligned to the point where it will not plug into a port. Totally useless item.
5,This case works perfectly so far. Good protection for my IPad & shuts it off when I close it. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,This kit is perfect for your ACER A100 because have everything to use in all way to enjoy better the tablet experience and come in with all table necesity.Thanks.
1,The battery don't hold a charge it overheats after 10 minutes of useshuts tab down. Very disappointing!
5,Great price & fits just like the crazy expensive ones in the store
1,I am sure that it is perfectly fine case but I bought the incorrect one (I have a mini) and could not return it.  Was completely my fault but still not happy. Therefore unhappy with it.
5,Usually these brackets cost close to $100 but this product was very inexpensive and is good quality and does the job of mounting my flat screen.
5,Great Case this is my second one I used the other case so much it wore out. Great protection.
5,It's great. The only thing I really don't get is the handle. You would have to carry it open to use it.
5,Good looks and build quality can't beat the price.  2nd case purchased 1 for 7" and 1 for 8.9".  both are great
5,Fits my Kindle great.  Shuts it off when you close the case.  Keeps the screen from getting scratched. Overall I am very pleased with this.
1,should have known but this is fake it does absolutely nothing. You need a active computer chip to convert the VGA image format into the RCA/S-video composite one. This does not do that
5,looks and performs just like Monster cable  brand but at a lesser price Ive been selling and installing home theater for years and highly recommend this cable
2,It doesn't balance properly
5,This is a great case to protect my Kindle- I would suggest to anyone who needs protection ! Delivered as promised and I can't complain !Thanks
5,this came in the mail about a year ago and i put it up in about 35 minues with the tv. no problems. very please with this product i recomend.
2,too hard to apply
5,perfect for my I pad.  love the fact that you can adjust it for just reading and it doesn't have to lay flat.
1,Junk!  Totally worthless.  I installed both the amplifier and the electrical booster and had absolutely no change in reception or added stations.  Do not waste your money.
5,1070 is up and running
1,USELESS.  THROWN IN TRASH.  EVERY DISC SHOWN AS UNREADABLE WITH VSO INSPECTOR AND EVERY OTHER DISC RECOGNITION KNOWN TO MAN.  THESE DISCS ARE CRIMINAL!!!!!!!!ATROCIOUS PRODUCT AND WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.
1,I suppose if you like to have a case that is almost have the size of your Nook.. this would be great.  Unfortunately I can bet there isn't a person alive that would want that.
5,This is exactly as described direct fit for the nook its good quality and the nook fits tight into it and for the price great deal
1,This product is worthless and won't work with most video cards. It will fit on the card but if you card is not set up for a TV your out of luck.
1,Apparently you need some sort of convertor for this to work. Doesn't state so of course I didn't find it out until I received it. Luckily it was not an expensive purchase.
5,Nice
5,This is a great case. Protects without adding an excessive amount of bulk. Good viewing angles and nice color. Met all my expectations!
2,Okay
5,works as should
1,I was unhappy with the quality of this HDMI cable. When plugged in to my sources the signal was constantly blinking in and out.
5,I've had this for 2 years now and it's been great. Keeps my toddlers crazy messes off the screen and that's what I needed.
2,It didn't fix
2,did not match
1,Looked like it was well built however it made no boost or quality in my cable feed.  Worthless purchase!
5,Loved the case and so did hubby....so much that I had to order one for him!!
5,Works great and easy install
1,First it took a month to get here and second it came in a cheap envelope that got all bent and the screen protector ended up being worthless cause of all the bents and cracks
1,this protector might work but after it is shipped from hongkong the entire sheet is not even flat any more ther is no way you can put it on. it is a waste of money
1,I was so disappointed in the screen protector when it got here it was bent so when I put it on my Ipad there are big bubbles because of the dents in the screen protector.
5,Works perfect good video quality
1,I wasn't able to get this one on my iPad so I ended up throwing it away. I haven't had problems in the past with any screen protector but I just couldn't get this one.
1,I ordered these screen protectors and waited quite some time to get them. When I received them they had creases all in them. I had to throw them away. They felt so thin and cheap.
1,No matter what settings I try it only does black and white video.  Make it less useful for most of my applications.
1,Doesn't fit new model as claimed (magnets in wrong place so it doesn't go into sleep mode when the case closes).  Can't return.  Out of pocket for a useless item.  Don't purchase.
5,Installed easily and is holding a 27" TV just fine. If you need a cheap mount for a smallish TV I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one.
5,This case is awesome! Great protection! Good looking! The case makes a nice stand for your ipad. Excellent choice to protect your ipad from accidental damage!
5,Awesome case! Arrived quicker than I expected! I WOULD buy again from CaseCrown! The case fits snug and well. Wouldn't have asked for a better product.
2,Wrong size.
5,Great case. Sturdy and protects iPad very well. Adjustable back rest is handy.
2,It's okay
5,Nice case
5,So far so good.
5,The cover/case works exactly as described. It is actually of much better construction than I anticipated. Looks great and provides the protection you need. Very well designed.
5,For a great price you can't go wrong! Fits great and protects the Kindle great!I would not think twice about buying more if needed.
1,Product failed in less than 2 months from purchase. Not happy at all
1,Fits my kindle but cheaply made. Have had it less than 3 months and already the crease on the cover is fraying. Next time I'll spend more and get a better quality case.
1,Tried to set up homemade apple tv and it was a waste of time and money even though it was a dollar now it just collects dust in my house
5,It's a cable what more can I say. No issues.
5,super low price for such an outstanding product!  The case is as good if not better than those that cost 5 to 10 time more..
5,Outstanding craftmanship fit my kindle perfectly and the price was amazing. Expect this case will last a very long time yeah.
5,Perfect exactly what I needed
5,Excellent; replaced an identical case that lasted five years.
5,Bought it for the price and never expected the quality and versatility that I have with the case. Will definitely recommend and will buy another.
1,Shipped color is different from the one shown on the amazon website. On amazon it is dark red but the shipped one is bright red looks ugly. Quality seems awful and looks cheap.
1,So difficult to place cleanly on my iPad. It actually seemed like there was no way to place it on properly at all. Maybe my fault for trying to find something so cheap.
1,If you are thinking about purchasing this then grab a wad of money and burn it. It will be have been better use than owning this piece of crap.
1,it did not even work. I plugged it in and it did nothing with multiple devices. This is a poor product and i would rate zero stars...Do not buy!!!
5,I really like this case it protects very close fitting and is very light. I would certainly buy another and recommend to a friend...
5,Ok
5,Tudo perfeito entrega rápida e produto de ótima qualidade. O vendedor atencioso e honesto. Nota 10. O chato é ter que digitar um monte de palavras sem necessidade.
5,Great producct great price and very happy with it!  Its a very reasonably priced HDMI cable.....nothing fancy but works great and for much less than the store.
5,Have these in my walls for two tv's that I have mounted for extra monitors. they work very well.
5,I love it and it keeps my simple touch protected  i would buy another leather case i would like to have a rainbow covers
1,The cover was bent when I received it and it was old and it would not release from the paper it was on and it took for ever to get to me!!!!
1,Ordered a screw and a spacer and the idiots couldn’t even get that right. Just a spacer came. Thanks. They could screw up a wet dream.
5,Works great no problems thus far.
1,I ordered the wrong battery.  Ordered the battery for the Galaxy 4 it should have been for the Galaxy 2.
1,I bought it to connect my hp laptop Compaq 6910p to my Philips HDTV. It does not work. Tryed it with the component connection and the S-video same results.
5,It is a Christmas present to myself. It has not been open yet. Not to be opened until Christmas Day. Rating will be submitted later.
5,Well made great price & love the stand when I'm following recipes in the kitchen. It also has perfect access for the charger & micro HDMI cables.
5,Fits like a glove
5,Gold plated for good conduction works perfect for hooking a computer up to a tv monitor picture is very  sharp and clear. Very good deal.
5,This case was above my expectations.  I recommend it to all kindle users.  Looking forward to buying another for my other kindle.
5,The case is good quality and fits my kindle just right.
5,Great quality for the price!  I was pleasently surprised that it was such a nice case since I got it for sucha great price!!
5,thanks!
5,after looking at local stores I was not happy with what I seen so I looked on line and was very happy with what I bought
1,The cable didn't do as I intended. The image on the television was grainy and horrible. THIS CABLE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO CONNECT YOUR COMPUTER TO YOUR TELEVISION.
5,Good price fast delivery good quality.  Thank you!
1,within 3 days of use the glue that binds the material together is already failing. this product is not made well and would not recommend it to any one i know.
5,I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW ALMOST 1 YEAR LATER....THIS CASE IS EXCEPTIONAL....STILL LOOKS BRAND NEW AND STILL HAS THE "NEW" LEATHER SMELL
5,Fits my new iPad air perfectly! Bright cover is easy to find in darkened luggage great for travel. More durable than cheaper priced ones.
5,It is exactly how it was described. Durable stands like it suppose to and attractive.  I love it!
5,Can't beat it for the price! Like in other reviews it does have a chemical smell upon opening. But the smell fades within hours.
5,I love this item it is much less expensive than anything I found in the regular stores and it is much more protective! I love this item!
5,item as described
5,Plenty of length for connecting many HD devices to whatever you're connecting at a very very low price.  Way to beat the stores!!  Buy this not the store rip-offs.
5,Works as promised..fast shipping too
5,Only took my husband and I 30 minutes to hang this!  Works great for our 55 in Lg have recommended it to several of my friends!
5,They worked although I ended up needing gender connectors because this was a male cord and I needed a female cord (or vice versa).
1,I purchased this adapter because I wanted to connect to a tv thru a S-video cable instead of a VGA cable.The cable didn't do as I intended.
5,Love love love it! The description was right on the money & delivery time was excellent! Would gladly do business again!
1,Worked okay'ish for a week it did what I needed it to.Died after a week won't power on.
5,Love it! Great quality and the color is very bold just like I had hoped! I got the red one!
5,It was great. Everything I needed to change out my battery.
5,Fits great protects better than the old one that broke.  Price was definitely great for this item compared to others I looked at.
5,Excellent product worked well really recommend is a good productoa an unbeatable price I am happy for this purchase reallmente if needed would buy another product equal.
5,Great way to keep order and know what you have. No more double buying of cd's. Just need to figure out how to pile them up neatly.
5,This came very quickly and is exactly what I wanted. It fit the Nook perfectly. I like that it has the invisible magnet closure.
5,Light protective case with just the right amount of padding in the cover to have the feel of protection without the weight.
5,Bueno
1,It bubbled all over the screen came in bent and the corners were too bent to even stick on the ipad. I tossed it. Glad I got my money back.
1,this product doesn't work.  it physically connects your monitor jack to a svideo cable but the picture that shows up on the television is scrambled.
5,I bought this for my nephew and he seemed to like it. Don't know if he was more excited about the color or now having a cover.
1,It stopped working after 6 months. Do not buy it.
1,it is hard to place on and there is no way to get buble out work on it for one hour but still having bube and it will not work
5,Received both HDMI cables sealed in plastic packaging with plastic covers over end of prongs to keep protected in transit. Both work great. And a great price!
5,It fits the Kindle perfectly is decently priced and is simple easy to use and robust. Seems to be good enough to protect it.
5,Blu-ray Memorex  are the best dvds for use of movies and basketball games.  The pictures are beautiful. Just love movies and ballgames on Memorex
5,My first tablet / e reader purchase the case crown is very good.  It fits my needs perfectly.  I would recommend to others
5,the cover for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 works great.  Really love the magnet sleep function so you don't always have to power on and off.
1,Doesn't Work at all. It cant get worse. Shows a black screen when connected.Tried both the yellow VGA output and the Svideo. both dont work
5,Great screen protector easy to put on protects my screen.  Recommend it highly. What else can you say about a screen protector??
5,I was a little concerned due to the low price but  I love this cover.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
5,Perfect!!! Just what I needed. Will be buying more!!!!  :-)
1,I thought I purchased the correct size but found out it was too small.
5,I use this cable to connect my HD camcorder and HD TV. The recorded HD footage can bedisplayed on my HD TV in very good quality. It is not necessary to buy expensive cable.
5,very good deal for the money I would have paid more for it. fits good and looks great. I would definitely buy this again
5,It was a bit complicated for me to apply it but I love it. It was way more worth the price. I am satisfied!
5,Love it.  very durable
1,There were too many air bobbles.  I could not get the cheap screen cover to work correctly.  I will try other screen protectors just not this one.
1,...and I finally couldn't take it any more and threw it away. A far cry from my beloved iPhone screen protector which I've trashed and am ready for another.
1,because it's not working. i feel cheated this did not work all my tv is show is blur. it's not projecting my laptop. for shame.
1,This crapy bent up plastic. Nothing but air bubbles n came in a paper package . Really sucks dont buy. I ended up throwing away. Came all bent up.
1,I tried using this VGA to s-video/RCA converter with 2 different TVs and computers and was only able to product white lines on my TVs.
1,The outputted video is always in black & white no matter what. Pretty frustrating as I wasted time ensuring it wasn't a problem with another area of the setup.
1,Video display is all messed up when using my Commodore 64. This device should support it but the colors are all messed up and the video is garbled.
5,This is a great case for the price.  Very sturdy and when using it in the upright position it holds very well.
5,Great case! Works great. Lightweight and fits my iPad perfect.
5,Well-designed well-made case for Kindle HD 8.0" tablet.  All of the cutouts are well-placed.  Excellent case for the price.
5,Fits perfect good quality
5,Excellent replacement battery at a great price.
5,last a long time and very durable I have had it for almost three years nice and fast shipping
1,I don't even think it deserves one star it came in the mail bent with nothing to protect it and it wasn't even sticky don't waste your money.
1,Does not turn the vga signal to av or s video dont not buy a waste of money if that's what your looking to do
1,Impossible to put on without bubbles.  Went to the Youtube video and even tat said it's hard to put on.  Should have read the reviews first
5,Great product.
5,Very good
5,Received the case and it fits perfectly good quality and it looks great. I Definitely recommend this case if you have a kindle!
5,Awesome screen protecter I love it. It makes my iPad look amazing I can see the retina display and it protects the screen very well
5,Is exactly what I was looking for. My TV looks faboulous and now i can see it better. thank you. Is a great buy
5,This product worked well and as described in the description.  It is a standard screen protector that fit my iPad 4 well.
1,I had to give a one star to submit this warning...reality zero star. Case was damp and full of toxic mold!! Do not order from this company.
1,The cover does not fit.  The cover opens from right to left to have the controls available.  Perhaps this is the only one?
5,Red case fit Ipad Air perfectly.  Satisfied.
5,This case is perfect for what we use the Kindle for. I love the auto wake/sleep feature. Nice looking case that shipped fast.
1,I hated it with a passion. It got bubbles on the screen it made my iPad start acting crazy and it wouldn't pick up my touch sometimes
5,I'm very satisfied with my order. It is all the essentials that you need don't look anywhere else . I would recommend this product to anyone.
1,Dissatisfied...I only receive one screen protector and and the cleaning cloth this is a rip off. Actually haven't use it yet so not sure of quality yet.
1,Was advertized for Acer a100 does not fit. Slots do both allow to use plug ins or anAdjust volume. Unit does not fit in case properly
1,This product although cheap was not the best screen protector.  I have yet to find a screen protector for my ipad that I am satisfied with.
1,This is not a PC to TV cable. If u want to use it for that do not buy this!!! It will not work.
5,Very happy with this product-exactly what I was looking for. Well made good feel and look.  Magnetic on/off features work great.
5,Like the red color with my silver iPad. It fits well. Kid dropped it once on a wood floor the iPad is fine

5,Good quality work good
1,Does not fit gigabyte motherboard like it says
1,This adapter cable did not work at all.  Very disappointed.  Big waste of money.  Don't waste yours on this product.
1,Product did not work. I tried multiple times. The only positive is the adapter did not cost much. Do not recommend this adapter.
1,This product was very thin and not too stable.  I had purchased Nother before and that one was great I guess I was from another vendor
1,I received this adaptor and was unable to use it as it did not work.  Great price...maybe others ave had better luck.
1,This did not work with my m2 slingbox and verizon fios box
5,Perfect fitting the color is perfect. And durable...
5,Fast Shipping the cable is the great quality so to construction and the sound obteined for subwoofer. Great value for the money. The Best.

5,This worked perfectly on my Maximus VIII Hero.
5,It is a perfect fit. I recommend it to all who need a case.
5,I really love this case.  It is light while still providing good protection for my iPad Air.  Good Quality.
5,Perfect fit pretty good working
1,Thank heaven it only cost 1.95... Cause it didn't fit my new IPAD and was supposed to fit. Threw it away...not worth the trouble of returning!

5,Works very well.  Has a hole in the back so you can use mic.  Feels good in your hand
5,Item arrived very quickly and was as described. Thanks! A+A+A+A+A+
5,The case was selling at a very good price; in sum great fit looks great and does the job as expected.  Thanks
5,This case is terrific for the 8.9 inch Kindle Fire.  It is attractive yet durable.  We like it a lot!
1,It did not work. The screen protector did not fit my iPad accurately and it only lasted 3 days because then the screen protector came off.
1,This item is by far the worst thing I have bought i waited 20plus days to get it the plastic looks like food wrapping plastic terrible
1,It was a Waste of time and energy putting it on and I ended up throwing it away. Save your money and buy a different product!

5,It is a perfect fit for my reader  I love it and the color great price  the quar is good
1,does not work all i get is a blank screen tried with different tv's different computers it just wont work for me
5,This is a really solid case (and inexpensive).  Works perfectly with the Kindle Fire HD.  No complaints and protects the kindle well.
1,When it was received in the mail the cover was all bent up! The packaging was not suitable for this product at all.  It's useless!
1,After waiting for  a month this cable doesn't do anything...tried it on different devices same result. lost of time and money
1,it does not work at all plugs in fit fine but won't work wish i had my money back for something else

5,Nice product for sure.  Very quickly delivered and was everything I had expected.  Many thanks:)
5,I just bought two more for a new blue ray player I recently bought. What can I say? They work and they're cheap. 'Nuff said.

1,I am not happy with this order.  I have been waiting for 3+ mos. for this item.  I am not at all happy!
5,This was exactly what I hoped for. It was cheaper than I found anywhere else. It arrived when expected with no problems at all.
1,Bought 2 and one doesn't work at all other only works if you bend the cable tight. Spend the extra money and get better ones.
5,The screen Protector is just what I wanted. It is working great on my I-Pad. and keeping it safe from scratches

1,Tried to make my computer screen show up on an old TV.  This product does NOT work for that purpose.
5,A great product for the price! I love my bright red iPad cover.
1,Simple as is. The audio and video plug is 0k but the s-video output is impossible to sync with TV screen.
5,Works well. The edges are starting to fray a little after almost a year of heavy toddler use ;-)
5,These screens do the same job for the $30.00 from the store. why not get something cheaper that works the same ? . Highly recommend.
1,This device will not work from a PC to a TV. If that is your intention do not buy this product!

5,This device performed as expected right our of the box.. Very pleased.....

5,A very good quality for the price paid.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
4,I would like to give it five stars if it wasn't for the crappy Chinese tubes that it comes with. Don't hold that against this amplifier it's a nice amplifier for tubes at this price point remember this is an entry-level tube headphone amplifier.  Paired with a nice set of headphones from Shenhaiser 600 650 or 800  and a set of  ( NOS)  New old stock tubes  you have a very nice piece of equipment when listening to high quality recordings.  There's a couple of internal modifications you can do if your electronically inclined and no stereo and amplification equipment .  Update August 20 2017 I've rolled many tubes through this amplifier in the past several months sounds great with all of them absolutely  amazing with the Sennheiser HD 800.  A recent addition to my dark voice added clarity depth  and even a more detailed sound.  I recently purchased a mobile DAC AMP  (IFI black label)  it's my first day back purchase I've read about them but never owned one until now when I put it into preamp mode and ran either my iPhone or computer through the USB cable to the DAC amp and then into my DarkVoice  it brought out detail in the music and listening through my HD 800 unparallel sound you must have clean recordings FLAC or Lossless files through a computer to take advantage of the sonic realism.  I let each of my three sons who do a lot of gaming and listening to music use my dark voice and headphones and they were blown away of the sounds they heard in there shoot up war games all three of them gave it a thumbs up.  Dark Voice will soon have three new customers putting in their orders .  This amplifier is sold every several months on Mass Drop for $199 just wait it's more than worth it.  It's a great addition for any gamer.
5,I'll admit I'm a tube fan to begin with. However with headphone amplifiers you can go either way and be happy I believe. I have a solid-state Origen+ DAC/Amp  that I purchased from Amazon and gave 5 stars to. For an inexpensive little amp it's quite good. I purchased the Dark Voice from Massdrop but I am recommending it here anyway. For the price it's really hard to beat. I concur with the other reviewers who recommend buying better tubes than the stock Chinese tubes that come with this amp but they are not really bad. Just you can do better. However if this your first foray into tube amplification then by all means use what the amp comes with and you will not hate yourself. When you're ready to try better tubes they are not hard to come by. Great headphone amps can run into a lot of money if you care to chase that dragon. I've auditioned several. I think they are all good. For the price of this solid performer you can't go wrong. It's musical and powerful. My headphones are easy to drive but I'm barely at 9:00 o'clock on the dial. This is a solidly built amplifier. It's a little tank that can make good headphones sing like angels. My system is not auspicious. I'm running my digital output from my MacPro into an SMSL M8A DAC powered by an SMSL P1 Linear Power Supply. This DAC feeds an analog output to the Dark Voice. I own a pair of Audeze LCD-X headphones - no slouch there at all - but quite honestly the bulk of my listening is on my daily use headphones a pair of Monoprice Monolith M1060 Planar Headphones. All of these items can be gotten through Amazon and with the exception of this amp they have been. I'm always going to be trying other gear "just to see". But in all honesty I doubt anything can beat this Dark Voice amp. It's clean sounding lovely and non-fatiguing for hours on end. Sweet detailed highs full and lush mid-range and a well-defined bottom end. People often complain that tube amps lack good bass heft and power. That isn't lacking here. The kick drum on Paul Simon's 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover has impact and weight. The bottom bass reaches in Flight of The Cosmic Hippo by Bela Fleck and the Flecktones come across with authority and definition. FYI I'm using some NOS tubes: RCA 6AS7G for the output tube and Sylvania 6SN7GTB for the preamp tube and they really make this amp come alive. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase and you will be as well. I've received nothing for giving this review other than the pleasure my ears have gotten from it. I wish you the best of happiness if you try this amp out. As always the better your source music the better the output will be. But this is a damned good place to start. Cheers!
5,I've owned mine for about 2 months now. I use it with higher impedance headphones like the Beyerdynamics DT880 250 ohm headphones. I would suggest investing in some NOS 6SN7's and some 6080/6AS7's.  Specifically I have had really good look with the triangular plate Sylvania 6SN7's and my favorite 6as7 is the RCA curved bottles. As with any tube equipment there may be some burn in required but not as much as you may read on music forums. Regarding sound quality some compare to other amps and say its not as detailed. Well let me say you don't buy tube amps if your main goal is clarity and clinical type precision. You buy tubes amps because of their musicality and character. This amp has plenty of clarity and sound stage but this amp oozes musicality and character in spades.  I have compared other OTL's and while they sound good they sound solid state in comparison. I highly recommend this amp for vocals and instrumental.  This is where it is simply unbeatable.  It can do hard rock and heavy stuff but the stuff that is not overly processed like classical jazz vocal and instrumentals that are more pure recordings are the best.  The sub bass produced by this amp lets you hear fullness not capable on your home stereo or PC.  For piano music you can hear the full range including the rumble of the body of the piano.Regarding the technical stuff I love the fact that these are largely wired point to point hand wired meaning minimal proprietary parts.  Any tech should be able to source parts if necessary later down the road.  I am not a big fan of PCB board or proprietary parts. Like many tube amps from 50+ years ago it will not become obsolete like much of the solid state amps in a few years.  This amp also offers the best selection of NOS tube availability in comparison to alot of other OTL amps.
5,I am giving the Dark Voice 5-stars across the board because it is very well built and terrific value for the money.  However I'm surprised that in doing very carefully controlled A/B tests between my Loxjie P20 hybrid and this full tube OTL Dark Voice headphone amp I hear virtually no difference in the sound.  Both sound the same.... wonderful.If I listening with extreme care to some bass heavy classical symphonies like those of Beethoven I can perhaps hear a little more bass on the Dark Voice and the bass decay has a very slight liquid quality on the decay.  However it is an extremely subtle difference in regards to the Loxjie P20.  In fact it may well be nothing more than a placebo effect.  The mids and high end of both units sound exactly the same as well as the wide and depth of the soundstage.  No difference.  I am using the headphone amp with a Sennheiser HD650 300 ohm headphone setup.I enjoyed the sound of the original tubes but regardless tube rolled in a nicely spec'ed NOS Raytheon 6080 power tube and a newly constructed preamp tube the well regarded Tung-Sol 6SN7-GTB.  Note that because the Dark Voice uses AC for the tube heaters (bad idea!) many newer 6SN7 preamp tubes will create a loud hum.  A DC-based tube heater system would have been much preferred but given the low price of the Dark Voice I can't complain too loudly.  The "cure" for the AC humming sound you hear from your headphones can be easily fixed by removing the bigger 6AS7 power tube and leaving the unit on for several days so that the smaller 6SN7 tube can burn-in for awhile.  After two days of burn-in all humming was gone.What is truly amazing about the Dark Voice is just how heavy it is and how well built.  The volume knob in particular is nice and heavy and moves with a butter-smooth motion.  The smartly designed off/on switch toggles on with a solid click.  The 1/4-inch headphone jack is made of solid metal.  All nice stuff!  However I'm now thinking that if I truly want to experience full blown "toobe sound" I might need to look at a non-OTL type tube amp.  It is difficult to build a high quality non-OTL tube amp so the cost would be much higher than this Dark Voice.  Maybe someday I'll take the plunge.  For now the Dark Voice is something I can highly recommend.  Just be careful not to expect too much if you are already using a solid-state/tube hybrid headphone amp that is well designed.
2,When you buy this amp you're throwing the dice. Some people report no problems. But many do have problems. I have problems .... there is a persistent staticky hum in the right channel that short of me cracking the unit open and changing components out (a task for which I am not well suited) I am stuck with.Don't get me wrong. For a couple hundred bucks you're getting some pretty good sound.I wouldn't buy the unit again...but I can see why others would. Even with the hum this unit sounds better than my Schitt Vali 2. ... but once my brain notices that hum I can't hear anything else ... it's somewhat maddening.
2,First the included tools.Trash. Comes with 3 different screwdrivers. The only one you need is the Philips and the head angle was stripping the top of the screws. My eyeglass screwdriver did it very efficiently though.Plastic pry-bars break easily. Using the corner of a drivers license worked much better.It did come with two triangular tabs that should make excellent guitar picks. I'll try that out tomorrow since its getting late.The battery itself came with a 50% charge and is charging at the moment.I'll update this review IF the battery is able to hold a charge as well as the original battery.The original began swelling which is why it was replaced. The swelling was extensive enough that it bowed the screen and digitizer completely out of the tablet's casing on both sides. It still held a good charge even after 5 years. I hope the replacement can hold up as well.
3,Purchased 2 last Sept & Oct  thru Slingbox website.  They say "Frontier" on the bottom.  Have M1 Slingboxes  with Comcast Xfinity.  Work well BUT they now shut down unexpectedly and must be unplugged & again plugged in order for TV to work.  May be a problem when we're visiting family in Europe and want to watch American TV
5,Don't be tempted by the cheap price.  Your computer MUST support TV-OUT for this to work.  It's not a matter of "maybe I'll get lucky" or "maybe those bad reviewers just didn't know what they were doing".  If you do not have TV OUT this WILL NOT WORK.  Simple has that.  VGA is not just a different type of plug for the same ol' video signal.  It is a completely different method of transmitting a video signal across a wire than S-Video.  You can NEVER just get an adapter plug and expect the convert VGA to S-Video (or RCA jack Video).  It requires electronic circuitry to actually convert the signal to a different type of signal(which is what those more expensive converter boxes are).  Computers with TV OUT capabilities have this circuitry contained inside them.BTW - if you are still feeling lucky - know that most computers DO NOT have this capability. It is not standard. So be sure you read the documentation for your computer.  If you don't see TV OUT - don't buy this cable. Spend the $30-$40 and get a converter box (which is what you need).So why did I give it 5 stars?  Because if you DO have TV OUT then this cable does exactly what they say it will.  And is a great value for the money.
5,Today I received my DarkVoice 336SE (referred as the 336). I ordered the 336 from a different vendor (better price). I've read many reviews on Amazon and the internet of the 336. The reviews were mostly positive. I became intrigued and started wondering “How good is this tube amp; really?”. Most reviews of the 336 were good if not excellent (once you upgrade the vacuum tubes that come with the unit). The tubes that come with the 336 are not up to par. After reading many reviews I decided to pull the trigger and bought the 336. The replacement NOS tubes I ordered arrived the same day as my amp what are the odds of that! I didn't bother installing the stock tubes; I purchased a matched pair of NOS GE 6080 power tubes (the large one and I kept the other as a spare just in case). For the per-amp one NOS Tung-Sol 6SN7GT "mouse ears" (smaller one). Very clean tubes with no perceived hum. Once I turned the 336 ON I noticed a mild burning odor as the tubes began to warm up. That lasted for about 30 minutes. No worries that’s normal for vacuum tubes. I call it the “break in period”. After that no more smell and the 336 ran flawless. I have the 336 hooked up to Edifier’s R2000DB power bookshelf speakers and they sound amazing. Currently I’m experimenting with different earphones. Currently I’m using the CCA C10 ear monitors they sound amazing. The music sounds accurate detailed and the soundstage is wider. I listened to my favorite tracks for a couple hours very satisfying. The next step is to roll different tubes into the 336. I also purchased one Sovtek 6SN7GT (smaller one) pre-amp tube which I intend to test soon. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the 336 to anyone looking to enter the universe of tube rolling. Best of luck to those who decide to take a leap of faith!
3,This does not appear to work with a Global Cache iTach Flex
2,I have several businesses and I started using these for security camera displays. about 50 to 40 percent of them will stop working/ burn out within a couple months usage. I am trying a higher priced one now Hopefully it will have better longevity.
3,It has a design problem. Can't plug the USB cable in the horizontal position. So you can't charge the kindle and watch a movie at the same time.
1,Based on my experience this is laughably horrible. I'm not new to tubes. I bought this for the bedroom using a laserdisc player (with direct CD circuit) as source. The internal headphone jack on the LD player sounds at least as good and provides more volume. On the Darkvoice it doesnt seem to get any louder past 12-1 o'clock. Something isn't "right" here...Tubes are glowing but im not hearing much power in output. I have headphones from 32 up to 600 ohm and only hearing negligible difference inoutput; the 600 ohm cans dont sound nearly as muffled but still not enough volume. Maybe I got a "lemon"?!?
3,Wow I litterly thought this was going to be 40 ft then it turns out it's 35. False advertising warning but overall the product is great. We used at church for the screens and it's awesome. Don't havre the product but don't false advertise
2,Obscenely priced.  Try Moddiy.com for 3mm 2.0 stand offs and 3.0mm screws. Much cheaper like .09 cents apiace much better.
5,Cables of this type may be a little tricky to understand. Think of it this way. If you want to have stereo sound you need two separate channels to carry the separate analog audio signals that comprise the complete sound one channel for the left speaker and one channel for the right speaker. The skinny 3.5 mm connector at one end of the cable forms two separate connectors at its end (one for each channel)- note the two separating black rings that define the separate channels. Now at the opposite end of the cable is a single RCA-type connector that can receive only a single audio analog channel.So the cable receives a single one-channel (mono) analog audio signal at its RCA end and distributes that single channel signal to both audio analog channels at the 3.5 mm connector end. Your speakers therefore receive the same mono input signal on both channels so each speaker plays all the sound of the same mono channel.
3,Ok for price  not as Heavy Duty as expected.
3,Good
3,The one I ordered folded to stand the one I received was just a fold up case. it was just disappointing to not get what I ordered. The product works good though and seems durable looks nice too.  I haven't used it yet because I ordered another one with the strap to hold it with I think I like it better and it was cheaper it also has a band for closure just extra protection.
1,8 pin side doesnt have anything lined up or secured correctly so wont even plug in to graphics card
4,Seems to be sturdy but I don't like the way it folds to be propped up. Quick delivery. Ordered it Wednesday & received it Saturday.
2,I'm not sure I can review the product because I could not use it. The screen protector came in a bubble wrap package with another item (car charger) I had ordered. I could not open the package w/o a scissor and when I opened it I had cut the screen protector!Had to toss it. Bad packaging.
2,The rims are too wide which hider access to ipad function bar. Magnet not strong enough told on to iPad Air on the back side. Must take extra care for stand mode which the exposed edge of the iPad is prone to impact and the unit is easilly tipped over.
1,Dont waste your money! Bought this as a replacement for the original case I bought in 2012. This one developed a tear and color layer started peeling off almost immediately. Doesn't  deserve one star based on quality of skin.
2,Has protected device  but edges fraying off with use  magnet in cover loose and moving around .
5,I originally bought this converter thru the Sling website so I could hook a Slingbox up to a DirecTV Wireless Genie.  It worked perfectly.  When I decided to disconnect DirecTV and go strictly to streaming I found an even better use for it.  I was able to use it as an interface between a 4k Firestick and a 2003 Sony 720p Plasma.  The plasma is only 43" and has component (no HDMI) but I have to say the picture is well awesome!  I highly recommend this especially if you are like some of the other reviewers and myself that can bear to throw away a good TV that cost many of thousands of dollars many years ago.  The Firestick works just as it should including powering the TV on and off.  I can't recommend this product enough.
5,The short version? I listen to a song on a well known bluetooth headphone (Sony WH1000XM3) which are considered by many to be top of the line bluetooth headphones. On them I had no complaints! it sounded awesome! but then I fire the DarkVoice on connect it to my HD6XX and listen to the exact same song.... OOOOOOHHH MAAAAHHH GAAAWD!!! It was a whole new level of experience! I was blown away! The sound felt bigger! more detailed! Hefty and meaty! the vocals made them SO SO SO SO MUCH enjoyable! this amp is just... wow! JUST WOW! Gotta try it man! What do you got to lose?
2,You get what you pay for don't waste your time
4,First I don't feel "Corner Protection" should be listed in caps just try hard not to drop. I also think the red should have been listed as red/orange. Somewhat common to refer to it as red but just know to expect it to lean towards orange not a bad thing just not a deep true red. Otherwise pretty much as listed. Good tight fit all things line up just fine. Fair value and I would reorder the product.Just don't buy because you think your getting great corner protection its ok but far from great.
4,Item worked as expected.  No software needed for unit work as shared printer
5,This cord is just amazing. Plain and simple. I wish I could have all 12 more of all difference lengths! (this cable comes in lengths of 3FT to 100FT) When it first arrived I knew it was going to be something great when the packaging itself is a pretty heavy duty box and when you open it right away you can tell that the cable itself is quality. It is thick and the coating on the plastic is very durable.  While the cable is pretty durable and thick it was also able to be routed through my wall (I have a wall mounted TV) easily and could bend surprisingly well.  I have it connected from my TV through my wall and into an audio receiver / switch.  The picture is just what you would expect it to be. Right now I don't have a 4K TV so I am unable to see exactly what the refresh rate is and comment on that quality but for a basic HDMI cable it is absolutely amazing.Full Disclosure: I received this product for free / at a discount in exchange for an open and honest review. Which is what you have just read. All opinions are my own.Overall; if you are looking for a long cable (or I am sure their shorter or even longer cables are just as good) I would definitely recommend picking up one of these cables.
2,It did not work with my computer. But for $3 it was worth a try.....
4,The case is sturdy and protects the iPad Air well. Only thing that is difficult is that use the exterior camera you have leave the cover hangout or make sure does not get in the way while trying to take photos.
4,If you put it in with the charger ports available on the right the cover will not control turning the Kindle on and off. If in wrong you will be blocking the camera. The charger ports must be on the left facing the cover. It worked great for me. Some people complained about using it in the standing position. I found very sturdy and doubt if there would ever be a problem. The only negative is I wish there was storage inside for a cleaning cloth. I slide my touch stylus in one of the side supports. For the price it was a great deal.
5,Have had this amp for six years and it works flawlessly. The audio transparency detail and musicality are spectacular and a real joy for an audiophile. Be aware that this amp is built like an Abrams tank. It is large heavy and extremely rugged nevertheless it is not meant to be moved around much. I have several headphone amps and this is my favorite. The DarkVoice 336SE is an absolute steal at this price. You do not however want to use the cheap Chinese tubes that come with it. To totally experience the 336SE's true potential you must get NOS tubes either American or UK made Do not use Russian or Chinese tubes. Good quality American and British made NOS tubes for this amp are available on ebay at a very reasonable price.
5,Do yourself a fever and dont buy this :) you know why it sounds so creamy so sweet you CAN NOT GO away from it... its 2 30 am now and i can not stand up to go to bed... It suits perfect with my Sennheiser HD600-650 (best with 650 to my taste) and HD800. and just to say you can not turn the volume knob more than 20 percent it was the power.
1,I tried to return it wrote to Amazon and no one has addressed my concerns.  It doesn't fit my husbands iPad we don't like it but when I checked it couldn't be returned!!!
5,These are pefecrt for my needs.  I put a tv out in the garage and was unable to get any channels out of our powered indoor antenna.  So I decided to use this long HDMI to run into my living room av closet and hook up to the HDMI output number 2 on my receiver.  I wish I would have went 5 or 10 feet longer but I was able to make it work just couldn't hide it exactly how I wanted.  So I may try an HDMI to HDMI extender and see if that will work.  The ends on this cable fit very snug and feel very secure in both my tv and my receiver.  I am very happy with the craftsmanship and quality.  I can not find anything that I do not like about this cable.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest review.  I would have glady paid full price because I was in the market for this but I happened to get lucky enough to get it pretty cheap and in return provide this review for everybody.
5,I actually purchased this item through a Sling advertised link last year and it took forever to get to me.  Wished Amazon had it back then.  This adapter works exactly as described.  Good advice is to power with a separate USB charger that stays on all the time.  Never had any problems with HDCP as it also passes through the HDMI signal perfectly from my Comcast box to my TV.  Only problem is that you need to make sure you use a cable box that works with infrared signals as most of the Comcast boxes have gone to RF.
4,I really like the case and feel like it does the job of protecting my Kindle. It also allows easy access to all the buttons and ports. I use the tripod function of the case while watching videos and it's steady and secure. Only downside is that when I am holding it to read the case is folded back and tends to overshoot one side by about a half inch and makes holding it feel awkward and cumbersome.
4,works well
4,It is a pretty good case
4,the vertical supports are a bit large for a 32" flat panel as they extend above and below the unit. However... if you mount them on the back of the screen so that they stick up higher on the top than the bottom you won't see them unless you walk right up on it. Unless of course you mount it below the optimum viewing height. Also we have an off brand model and the screw kit provided to mount the frame to the tv didn't have the size needed. We had to go to a local hardware store to get ones the correct length and size. Other than these things it was fine especially for the price.
4,Read the product description!! This product will NOT work with most video cards. I made the mistake of not checking to see if my video card had TV-out capability and this product did not work for me. If you want to view your computer on the TV buy a converter like the   Lake PC to TV Converter Box compatible with Windows and Mac (VGA To RCA / VGA To S-Video)         (I just bought one and it works like a charm :)
5,Bought mine off massdrop. Tube rolled off ebay. Larger tube is stock. But tube rolled with front smaller tube  Eventually found a great tube off ebay. Can't recall what brand or model. But got a great tube to pair with Hd650.
5,Lol this guy said solid state hard drive. An SSD and a HDD( Hard Disk Drive) are completely different storage devices. It's called and SSD for a reason. Solid State Drive. I reject such a simple grammatical error
4,I'd have given 5 stars if you were able to prop this vertically as opposed to horizontal. I realise that this is the direction some would prefer but as I have to set the font large enough for me to see it's easier for me to keep vertical. The wake/sleep feature is wonderful and I like that my Kindle is very securely contained.
4,Sleek elegan and durable
5,With my HD-600 this unitsounds absolutely amazing!
5,This is my third br-r brands I used.  I decided to switch over to Memorex because their priced dropped and I like the Br-r top surface cover the most.  My first brand was Ritek it had a boring looking dvd/ cd silver.  Then got a maxwell with blue top cover.  People from 2010 have complaint that Memorex are repackage ritek tha tfade over time.  My first ritek blu-ray I burn from 1/2011 still works fine.  I check my first 2012 maxwell and it did fine too.  I was using a sony blu-ray burner back then.  I burn from my laptop now with a lite-on for later maxwell and memorex got no issues so far. I am burning at 6x even thought it is a 4x.Overall I will continue to use Memorex since they got the nicest top cover.  I might try Sony or Panasonic br-r if their price ever drop to more reasonable price ranges.  I burn a lots of br-r because I shoot RAW on my Nikon dslr.
5,Don't have time to do a full review right now but I wanted to mention that mine had a really loud hum and music sounded just terrible when I turned the volume up at all when I received it 2 days ago. I noticed that the power cable felt loose so I swapped for another and now it sounds really nice.
4,Great quality for the price.
1,Does not work.  Plugged it in and the the signal to just flickered.  Tried to plug a monitor in to the same VGA port to ensure it was not the port and the monitor worked just fine.  Sheer garbage.
1,The Memorex 25GB Blu-Ray media are blessed with a LOT of reports in specialist forums of fading after a few months. These are actually Ritek disks. A friend wrote today that he too just lost important backups the disks became unreadable. Do a little research before you write glowing reviews. The fact they burn and verify the same day does not mean they are "great media". The only "great" thing about the Memorex disks is the price. If all you need them for is to transfer some data to more stable storage within a week they are usable. But in view of all the people who have lost data photos video it's incredible they actually continue to sell these for "storage".
2,very dissatisfied customer It bubbles and looks horrible. makes it a little difficult to see screen clearly. Almost makes it a little blurry.
5,Sturdy good looking secure grip on the tablet easy access to everything on the device (camera speakers plugs etc.). The magnetic closure works well and it's nice having it turn the tablet display on and off when opened/closed. For ten bucks this thing is a steal.The only possible drawback I can see is that if you want to prop it open in portrait mode (which I personally don't need) you're out of luck.
4,I purchased these for my husband and son to go with their Nook Simple Touch.  They seem to be sturdy and provide good protection for their Nooks.
5,I bought a 25 foot HDMI cable 6 months ago to use for playing PC games on the big screen TV. It worked ok for a time but started developing some issues so I went for this one. So glad I did. I thought all HDMI cables were created equal but apparently there is such as thing as better transference. I plugged this one in for gaming and didn't notice a bit of lag. The picture was just as crisp as it is on the computer screen 30 feet away and the audio sounds fantastic.Disclaimer: I got this at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.
5,Packaged very well shipping box could have taken a beating and the product would have arrived safe. HDMI cable came wrapped in a Static Bag to help protect the cable. The male connectors on both ends are sturdy but not heavy like some of the other HDMI cables out there. Very thick cable which will help protect the cable especially when running it through a wall. The picture quality through this cable is beautiful. The sound quality is top notch. No complaints about this product at all. Very happy with the purchase. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
5,Look this is a poor mans Woo audio WA6 once you replace the tubes with quality ones . It's that simple .
3,I tried this with the Dell Studio S15. It does NOT work. If I figure out a way to get it to work I will surely post it here.
5,I recommend this product for people using a tv to get free channels. I did my research and this amplifier was #1 from consumers.  I bought it and easy to hook up. The channels that were going in and out. Came in clearer with no interruptions. Also picked up more channels. Now I will buy a better Antena. I should be able to pick up more. This product to is worth the price. A good buy too.
5,I waited a few months to write this review to see if I still love this cover as much as I did when I first got it. It is exactly what I was looking for. First off it came on time and was just as advertised. It looks great. Love the red. It is lightweight. I didn't want a heavy cover weighing my iPad Air down. The sleep function works great. You hear the "click" when you close it and the magnets in mine seem to be very strong. Some reviews said you couldn't use the strap to hold it when folded back in reading position because the magnets wouldn't hold it and it just flopped open. This is NOT a problem with mine! My magnets are very strong! The tabs you use to prop it up work pretty well. I have recipes on my iOad and use that feature to stand it up on the kitchen counter for hands free use. All in all I am very pleased with this cover and would highly recommend it!
1,This thing sucks don't buy it repeat don't buy it. There is a reason why more than 90 people gave it a 1.
5,Bought in 2014 for my son. He's now 10 (2018). Case has been put through rough use for four years and still completely intact! Exceptional quality product!
1,It came in damaged. Not worth the money I paid.
1,It was hard to put on and smears worse than the regular cover.  Hate it
1,not what I thought it would be
5,Perfect  protection for my hard drives. I bought two and love'em.
5,This thing is awesome. I can use my computer for computing at one end of the room while using the second video output and this card to drive a large monitor on the other side of the room. Now the whole family can hang out while I still do my thing.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
1,junk dont buy this
5,Good quality for the money
5,I bought this because I was tired of my kiddos watching the same two or three movies all the time even though we have over one hundred!! Our entire TV stand was filled to the brim with movies and you could never see the movies shoved in the back. A friend of mine told me to order this from somewhere else but I found this one with the book here for cheaper. Hers holds 120 movies but I am fine with 100 (for about $20 cheaper!). It took FOREVER to go through and take all the movies and covers out of the boxes and into the index book (and occasionally to take out all the movies and reorganize thanks to my three year old. Ha ha) but now finding movies is a breeze. My six year old goes through finds the movie she wants and gets it herself. My three year old goes through the book and brings it to me to show me the number of the movie she wants. They now watch so many different movies and it takes up just a small space in the TV stand! I would TOTALLY recommend this product and am actually thinking of getting another one for myself!
5,Works great.
5,It was durable enough to be shoved through a wallboard hole that was cut slightly too small for it. The cable bends well enough and seems like it will last well.
1,To the best of my knowledge after talking with people in electronics retail this product is a FRAUD.  A cable cannot overcome the language barrier separating VGA and RCA systems of information-storage.  For at least 90% of the customers who would want to order this item it is simply a scam a con.I'm not super computer-savvy but I think I've heard that some more expensive computer video-cards have a feature called something like "TV out."  Perhaps they could use this cable.  Mine couldn't.  I wasted my money.  Don't waste yours.KM
1,MY PC VIDEO CARD HAS TV OUT FUNCTION FROM VGA. THIS CABLE DOES NOT WORK . I TRIED ALL DIFFERENT RESOLUTION SETTINGS ON MY TV AND PC BUT STILL NO LUCK. I EMAILED THE SELLER HE NEVER REPLIED AND IT COST MORE TO SHIP IT BACK.TERRIBLE!!! JUST BUY A VGA TO HDMI CONVERTER BOX THEY ARE ON AMAZON FOR 30 BUCKS
1,The clear plastic continued to have air bubbles it got sticky and I could wait to remove it.  My fingers were not warm enough for the iPad to sense my entries.  Maybe with the stylusit would be better.
1,this cable don't works! I coonected to laptop and tv tuner out and no video!I don't recommend this product.and the fabricant or the store that sale this cable not contact to me and dont care our opinion.
5,Worked exactly as described. I'm a happy customer.
1,Never buy this product it is so cheap and when putting it on it has so many air bubbles. Please save your money because this is not even a good product to spend it on.
1,By time I received this it was all bent and I was no able to use it! I would not recommend this item
5,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QZ8Z78/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2
5,Very good case
5,Very sturdy.  Had previous case that was mostly plastic and cracked easily.  This is made of quality leather material so seems like it should last for a long time.  Highly recommend you won't be disappointed.  Liked it so much I bought 2.
5,excellent product
5,Arrived timely. Product works ok
5,Works great and easy to install with just a few simple hand tools. A power drill aids for screwing mount to the wall. Polaroid 55inch
5,Good durable case.  Nice fit design and protection.  As others wrote initially the smell is a problem but after a week or so it is almost absent.  Recommend it.
1,Every thing is fine but the main thing standing cover is faulty. There are two big spots on the cover so cover looks older.When you spend hundred's of dollars on tablet then spend some good money for your tablet to safe it.
5,I have several adapters but they must operate the opposite direction than I want I want to plug something into a PC Monitor and the plug video into it thru a RCA connector.. What Can I use? Plz.
5,The case is light and protected the kindle wellThe case is not slim but the fit is tight and provide good protectionI have not found any case for kindle that can fit and slim as well as the Apple cases for iPads -- even the Amazon made case is still not as slim and fitFWIW -- I am using the kindle more than I use the iPad (after install Chrome web-browser on it)
5,Okay - two cables for a penny.  Really who cares if it comes from Hong Kong... it will ultimately be from there any how right?  Second stop paying so much for HDMI cables they are all the same (see CNET review at this site: [...] ).  Tried my first HDMI for $1.  Works great! Now I have two more that are made better and were one penny.  Not each just one penny.  Sure shipping with Prime was $3 but who cares it was still cheap and works great! Need I go on?
5,Excellent case. Looks sharp and protects well. No issues at all.
5,very please dropped my nook on side walk last week and case saved it from being broken
5,Nicely padded and fairly easy to work the buttons. I don't have to worry about the Nook getting damaged if dropped.
5,These are awesome.  I have two and now my dvd's are easy to find.  Good stuff.
5,Love it. Discovered it had a small inside pocket where I can keep paper bonus!
5,delivered fast with no problems
5,I love this case. It's soft smells of leather and is a gorgeous accessory.
5,Great product for the price. I pad can slide out easily though.
5,The chord was in great shape but unfortunately we could not use it for what we needed. We were connecting a computer to our TV and our video card did not support it. Make sure that the video card has TV out capabilities if you plan to use this chord for something similar.However it is a great price and you couldn't beat it!
2,It works fine depending on the laptop video card. it is not working in one of my laptop.
5,I ordered this in purple for my Nook that I just purchased. I love it! I tried my Kindle in it (I have the basic Kindle)and it fits perfectly so now I am going to have to order a second one for my Nook! I have done business with eForCity before and will continue doing business with them. They always provide excellent service at reasonable prices.
5,as advertised
5,Great case.. good quality. Little tricky to prop kindle upright but otherwise very good case from amazon. Sturdy for kids too.
5,Love it!
5,These cables are very nicely made and seem very solid. Having the adapter come with it is stellar if your equipment needs one.
5,Fits perfect
5,The best. Nothing else is even close. Estimated shelf life as high as 300 years. No storage media is more durable excepting paper and stone tablets. Lower error rates in accelerated thermal testing than commercially pressed CDs.Worth every nickel and then some for priceless critical data like the pictures of your life financial records or other data that you want to keep for a lifetime+. The only media approved for archival storage of medical records.I could go on and on about this but the fact is that this stuff is without peer.
5,this came from china so it was a longgg wait! haha but it was totally worth it no bubbles if you follow the instructions great product cheap price dont hesitate must buy
5,I bought this for my 9 year old son. Worked perfect for him and what he needed! Great product for the price!
1,I got this hoping could bridge the gap from my ps2 to my tv (which is really a monitor) that only has hdmi and vga. Unfortunately the monitor never found any signals coming from the ps2. So it doesn't work.
5,The quality of this digital storage CD is without peer.I have used them all and none come close to quality or durability.These stand up to the handling far and above better than any other option commercially available at this time.My typical usage is for archiving digital images but have also noticed a very unepected benefit when burning music.  More volume available on replay and music has a fuller sound than the other media I have used.Nice jewel case too! I have yet to have one fall apart.Simply the best!
1,Title says it all. I waited for it to show up hooked it up and got a big fat nothing out of it not even static.
1,Do not order any products from eforcity.  They will take your money and stiff you on the product.  I ordered this cable and waited about three weeks.  It never showed up.  Clicking on the email link to track my package only came up with an error message.  It has been three months I have tried countless times to get in contact with them and there have been ZERO responses.  Don't give these scamers your money.
5,I know that this cord will work if the graphics card support TV out. I believe my graphics card (nVidia 9600M GT) support TV out but I am not able to configure properly. Can anyone help me out? Any links available to configure? Thanks
1,It is not working. Before buying I checked the video card. I tried with two laptop. If it is working for anyone please be specific about the requirement.
1,I can't believe amazon even sells this item. It doesn't work period. What a waste of money.
5,This cable works really well. my shipping costed more than the cable which really blew my mind away. if your looking for an hdmi cable get this one off eforcity you wont spend over dollars and this cable really made a huge change when i plugged it into my PS3 and flatscreen tv.
1,I am 99% sure that this is a fake product.  Someone got a bunch of salvaged parts and started creating these fake adapters out of them.  They sell them for very cheap so it is more trouble to return them than it is worth.  Add a little something about them not working for all video cards and they're off the hook.
5,This is a good product.As of 2-18-10 This item is On-Sale at this seller's WebSite
1,The image comes through all distorted. Both the RCA and the S-Video signal.Sorry... it's the truth. Glad I didn't spend too much on it.
5,after reading reviews on [...]and looking at the outrageous prices at department stores I purchased 2 of these cables and will be purchasing many more!
5,Bought 2 of these one 10 ft and one 15 ft and both work as advertised.
5,I lost the screw that came with mobo but had to get it for the m2.Works great on the  ASRock B450M-HDV with Samsung M2
5,This adapter works well and does what it’s supposed to for the Slingbox that is help if you only have HDMI on your cable box. My only complaint is that there are no instructions with it. I did find some directions on the Slingbox website but it would have helped with the adapter.
5,No problem setup
5,works great
5,I had a hard case for years and this one replaces it nicely without the bulk. As you can see I've crammed it with many cords. I will have my daily ones in here as well when I travel. It closes pretty well despite the bulky items I have in there such as car chargers and cubes. I even have a portable flashlight in here. Everything fits well in a nice place and I can rearrange to make it easier to close so the zipper lasts. LOL. I don't think I'd want a bigger case because if I'm trying to cut down on stuff what would be the point right? I think it's a good size considering I even have extra stuff in here I may take out. I like the different size zipper compartment for my cloth headsets. Don't think I can fit my huge Macbook pro chargers in here but they weren't in my previous case either. I wish it had a handle on the top for ease of carrying. Pretty well padded too. Nice color (green). I think this case will be a keeper for years. Update: I added velcro/glued handle and it seems to work well for me. See pic.
5,Good sound quality. Value for money. Lightweight
5,I needed a 10 foot thin optical cable for installation of my new TV this worked perfect fit nicely inside the cable management system. The sound quality is awesome.
5,Great value on a great product
5,I just needed the screw to secure my new M.2 SSD into my laptop. The screw was a perfect fit. Just so so for the price but it was what I needed.
5,I don’t like that if I take them off it takes a minute for phone speaker to work again but they fit and work great
5,its ok
5,Unusual cable. Just what I needed to send a mono phono output to both L and R of a stereo input.
5,Funciona bien
1,Didn’t work.
5,I like it 2 pack and quality is absolutely great for this amount
3,For the money they are a decent set of earbuds. 2 biggest issues: it doesnt automatically connect to the phone. The phone thinks they are bluetooth beats so you need to "pair" them everytime you connect it. Every call I make with them already plugged in I have to press the "baets" button that pops up. Second issue is that people have told me that I sound like I'm speaking in a hall way.  No issues for listening to people or music
5,Great sound quality
3,I like it but what I don’t like is that when you plug it doesn’t work until you turn on the Bluetooth I mean what is the point?
3,These earphones worked for a while but suddenly stopped working. I have mixed feelings about this product and would instead recommend bluetooth earphones from good brands such as Skull Candy or JLab. Hope this helps!
5,Love it. Was perfect for what I needed
5,Easy prefect
4,they’re comfortable in the ear but they take a good 4-5 seconds to work once they’re plugged in. they also claim to be beats?? and they’re bluetooth??? but they have to be plugged in to work? the quality of the audio is pretty fuzzy and grumbly to say the least
5,It is a practical gift.
1,Do not waste money on these! Take your money else where. The ear piece snaps on and off. Worst purchase! The only thing good about these was the fast shipping. Again do not buy take your money elsewhere. Waste of time and money.
5,It works perfect on my pad
1,I am not satisfied with the headphones. They connect via bluetooth even though they are wired. They often jam and you have to reconnect them
5,Quality is awesome
5,I only wish someone would come up with a way to keep them from tangling up. The sound is very good from them.
5,This was super great on the product because it made it very sturdy and reliable.
4,I had previously bought a cheaper hdmi to component converter to hook my android tv box to my slingbox 350. That model did NOT convert hdmi to component properly and the slingbox could not get video signal only sound.So i bought this converter and i am happy to report video and sound are converted perfectly from hdmi signal coming from my android tv box to my component input on my slingbox 350. So all is fine except...  i cannot identify a model type to configure a remote for my android box. Evidently slingbox 350 was designed a few years ago with cable and satellite boxes in mind so you can find a whole list of them and when you identify it correctly it pops a very useful "virtual remote" so that you can control your tv source (cable satellite or in my case android box) to change channels for instance. So i'm doing fine if i'm sitting in front of my livingroom htpc and have my android remote next to me. But if i want to use slingbox on my phone tablet or remote location i'm stuck to one channel. So that sucks. Of course it's not a conversion problem (hdmi to component) but since it is clearly mentionned it is designed for "slingbox" i would have supposed there would be a solution for "generic devices" with a "generic remote" some sort of simple one size fits all remote....  So if anyone out there has a solution let me know ! Thanks :-)
3,Fast delivery good quality.I would have given a 5star if it came with braided wire sleeve and was a bit cheaper.Also I wish you could purchase different lengths this is twice as long as I needed.Lastely the 8pin is a 6pin plus 2 pin style which is OK but I would have preferred a real 8pin housing.
5,I ordered something hoping to mod an old computer do not use with a power supply that is below 400w with a bigger GPU other than that worked really well.
5,I installed it myself.  Since we have Helix system for the cable tv we needed to have  an adapter for HDMI and it works great.
1,Bought and now returning the product. Used for Mac Pro-2010 5.1 on rx 580 video card. I connected the two mini pin pci-e cable to the adapter did not work so I switched the cables did not work. Then to make sure nothing was wrong with my 6 pins cables i re-inserted the old graphics card and tested both passed. So I decided to connect the single 6 pin wire to the adapter and test it on my old graphics card did not work black screen. Please let me know if i am doing something wrong or the adapter is faulty. Thank you.
1,I’ve been waiting nearly 2 months for this item to connect to my video card. Not impressedI’m sure it will work fine if everyone I get it.
2,False advertising!  Initial image shown on website shows four pin S- video cable as well as two audio cables. Once you purchase the item the image now shows only the S-video cable which is exactly what shows up in the mail.  Granted the written description indicates that you are buying an S-video cable but why show something in the image that is not included?
2,It works for a while then my graphics card signal cuts out. Apparently this means it isn’t getting enough power. Not very satisfied with a product which I paid $20 for only to find out it doesn’t work properly
4,The new battery works and fitting to replace existing tablet Samsung tab S2. No problem for the past over four months.
5,After replacing the battery that was not the problem Other than that Battery works great
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The factory GBU came with a defective cable  but the one I purchased from amazon is a perfect one
5,Fits in great. Thank you!For the initial price I got a set of 2 x Standoff and screw. Not sure if it’s a mistake.
5,Well made worked perfect in my application
5,Needed this to convert 2 6 pin PEG to a single 8 pin PEG power on an older motherboard. Works fine  worth the wait for the shipping up to Canada from the US.
5,The dark voice is a tube sounding amp for tube lovers it's amazing but equally at home against the reisong no you an9ther fab tube amp
5,Exactly what I ordered needed good quality happy with purchase
3,These standoff screws should be available more retail considering M.2 drive availability. It is very expensive ordering them online.
5,Fonctionne bien avec slingbox
5,Works perfectly!
5,Cela fait le travail.  Merci
5,Exactly what I needed for the m.2 hard drive. Cute little thank you note on the invoice was a nice touch. Good to see some good old fashioned businesses still around!
5,Easy to hook up... Worked well right away with sling box 350
5,Perfect
5,worked great
5,Ease of installation
4,Works as expected fairly good quality for the price
5,The battery was easy to install and holds a charge. It was also promptly delivered.
5,Arrived quickly and works as expected.
5,Was shipped very fast. Cable works as intended!
5,Worked
5,fast delivery and works fine!
5,Great
5,Works for RX590 in my 4.1 Mac Pro
5,Good product.
5,Worked great. Doesn't feel like a cheap cable. Has help up for over a year.
5,It was perfect. Was all hooked up and watching Netflix on HD TV in minutes!
1,My cable does not work ... I am not able to play a single game. How do you want I like it !
5,did what it done do.
4,mama mia whata gooda gismo isa this nisa picture nisa detecter follow me all around de room this a gooda value
5,The first thing I wish to state for those not wishing to read through my entire review is that this is my third ieGeek camera and I am entirely happy with this device.  I believe it to be super quality and excellent value for money and offers a full feature functionality set that is quite hard to better at the price and has certainly lived up to the high standard I have come to expect from my two existing ieGeek cameras.If you are looking for a low cost full featured high quality internal or external security camera I would without a doubt certainly recommend ieGeek.So I wanted a third ieGeek camera mainly for internal monitoring of my property.  This model is quite simply perfect.  Setting up was a breeze with the YI IoT app which allowed a very fast set up time and I was able to view the image on my camera within 5 mins of opening the box.Picture quality is excellent with full 1080 HD resolution available (you can select SD if preferable) which is pin sharp on my iPhone in both portrait and landscape orientation.  You can name the camera and this name is displayed on the screen if required together with the date and time.The app offers a range of advanced features all of which are extremely easy to use.  One thing I particularly liked is the ability to move the camera viewpoint remotely using the virtual joystick in the app. Using it the camera can pan and tilt across significant angles left right up and down so it is easy to adjust he camera from where you place it in its resting position to obtain the specific view angle you require.  This allows the camera to be physically positioned almost anywhere with full adjustment of the camera view from within the app.  Response times for camera movement are also impressive - around 0.5s latency in movement over my home WiFi.I am also able to view the image using 4G when I am outside my home network useful of course for when one is not home.Motion detection is excellent and can be set to detect people (with Cloud service subscription) or other movement within the camera field of view as standard. In fact I had to turn down the motion detection sensitivity as the camera was detecting the small branches on the bushes outside my conservatory moving slightly in the breeze.  Motion detection records short videos when motion is detected.There is also a voice function - referred to as ‘call mode’ - with this app not something I would ever need to use but has enormous potential for those who would require such functionality.  Interestingly the camera also features sound detection which is really useful if using the camera to listen for a baby cry etc.All in all this is a first class internal security camera that I am very happy with and would certainly recommend to anyone considering purchasing a home security camera.
5,Was much too expensive But! i needed it (Asus didn't include it with my motherboard). GutsParker put a personalized note in with it (funny as heck) and it worked great - no one else had it (including all local computer stores). He solved the problem. It arrived early. The guy is a character... I would buy from him again. Thanks Mr. Guts. The worst part of the whole experience was finding the part. Not Mr. Gut's issue - Amazon I am looking at you!
4,Positives:Easy to set up.Overall good value for the money.Some useful features.Negatives:Bigger than I thought it would be which along with the white casing doesn't make it very discreet when it's used to cover outdoor areas.If like me you use it facing outdoors through a window then the night vision doesn't work (yes I have checked to see if this feature is turned on).Outdoor length range disappointing. Doesn't pick up human movement at the end of a 35ft long garden (yes I have got the human sensor switched on).If you can live with the negatives then it's a decent buy.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 So I was I the market for a new camera I found out that this model was perfect for all the requirements I was looking.I’m very happy that ra comes with an app that I can control the camera directly through my phone anywhere and I can connect to it whee I am as I usually travel and I’m out house most of the time it’s nice to know I can have access to it anytime.For that reason is great that have night vision so I have completely vision capabilities through 24h even in darkness and it also works with glass which is a common problem with cameras that doesn’t work their algorithms properly when glass interference but this one works as well so I can use it to face the street from inside my house.One thing I really find useful is the human detection as I don’t have to worry when my pets for example are around so it avoid them.The most interesting part that I really like is that it havecloud storage so I can  have completely security that all the video footage is storage securely in internet so if something happens and the camera is damaged or stolen I would still have the videos in a safe place in the cloud.As well it comes with an standard usb connector so it can be use it with any usb phone charger and that gives the capabilities to use it with a power bank or a usb solar charger which means that you can use it for example in your caravan if you go camping to check the exteriors for example.Apart comes with a very useful app so you can control all the capabilities and settings so you can program to work as the behaviour you want.I do really like that the company thought about the environment and used cardboard for its packaging which is 100% recyclable.Overall I’m satisfied and happy with this camera.
5,Well this is the camera I've been looking for some many others over the years to be honest it blows alm other camers out of the water its epic quality well made and very very sharp pics with vision on if u need and can also turn it off to your hearts desire I makes this camera the best on the market as u can see I am very very very happy with this camera and it works through glass aswell which most home security cameras dont have that function which is a must if u really truly want to hide it on your window sill as I have done it kind of defetes the object of having a camera that only works in the day but this one works in ever situation and even clear at night as well which is a massive plus for me and may I say its actually very stylish aswell cant say much more other than it's an epic Camara a quick update this Camara see through the glass which most dont do that without glear its 100% the beat camara on the market at present its go into be hard to find one as good for the price I oayed it's amazing it means u can see them but they cant see u amazing now let see who has been stealing out of my front garden am ready for them now I'll update when I catch the cheeky baxxsrds lost all my plants form the front garden someone came and took them the day after I planted them now I be able to catch me and have evidence to show the police now so am ready and waiting amazing quality pics perfect in fact and so well built very sturdy
5,he camera is quick and easy to set up even if you are not very a technical person . There is a step by step guide in the instruction booklet which all you have to do is connect the cables and the. Download the Yl lot app. You then need to use your smartphone to scan the QR barcode so it can register the camera with your phone. Once set up it can be controlled from your phone and the camera can be moved around the room. The video capture is fabulous .Nice clean picture even through Glass if you turn the led light off .The Android app is very easy to use and you can do the following:> Move the camera up down left and right. It rotates 360 degrees.> Scroll back through to any date and time when the camera was recording.> Enable / disable the status light.> Increase / decrease the speaker and microphone volume> Hold the microphone button on the app to talk out through the camera.> Enable / disable the motion sensor alert system.> Change the time change the router upgrade firmware view camera information set viewing angle (and reverse it) and set a custom recording angle/time.In general the product is a well build and reasonably priced camera for a wide range of purposes with clear images and built in night vision with software for Windows Android or iOS that is feature rich and easy to use. Would recommend !
5,We have had cameras monitoring our dogs at night (inside) and through the front window  (to the outside) for approx 3 years now. The technology since we purchased the original cameras have improved so much. The original cameras still 'work' but they kept buffering/staggering the video hyuge jumps to 'catch up' or it just losing time as you watched it live whilst waiting for a delivery so we never had a 'true' live image onscreen.With these Igeek cameras all that is in the past.  Not only is the output now HD it doesn't stagger or anything. Even after an hour of watching the stream in our test it kept live and cars drove past as they did in real life.The picture remained HD the app was clear and concise to add on both android and apple devices and it was easy to walk through.The initial set up was easy however we did have to make sure the QR code was caught by the camera as pointing it at it first off didn't have it register but that was user error.All in all this is a fabulous update to our home security and we have purchased a second to update our dog camera too that will arrive tomorrow now we've tested it and trialed it fully.
5,I have been overwhelmed with the ease of use and the quality of this product. Within 5 mins of opening the box I had the camera setup and connected to the YI IOT app. The app is easy to use and allows complete control of the camera allowing you to move the camera up down left right aswell as hearing the audio from the camera aswell as speaking through the speaker of the camera (although I will now use this feature as I'm using it to monitor my car although it would be useful for monitoring pets etc).A good feature of the app is the automatic function of the camera where the camera will track movement and automatically follow the object. The camera also has motion detection where you can be notified through the app of any motion that has been detected.A cloud service is also available for the camera in which recording are saved to the cloud and can be reviewed afterwards but I'm not currently using this feature but is good for future use.In general the product is a well build and reasonably priced camera for a wide range of purposes with clear images and built in night vision with software for Windows Android or iOS that is feature rich and easy to use. Would recommend :)
5,Well I feel this is good price for this camera £37  and it works a treat.  I bought it because I wanted to monitor the cat (see if he was up to no good). I went over a load of  reviews on this camera (and similar) and they seemed to be okay. However this had sold over 1800 items with a 5* average. Turned up the day after I ordered it from Amazon. Very easy to set up and link to my phone through the app. There is a delay of about half a second viewing the picture – but it would be petty to complain about that!  I have only tested it during the day but the reviews indicate that night vision is okay. The color picture is superb. I can speak to my cat (which is funny as he comes up close the camera and his face look massive!) The sound is brilliant and seem to work like a walkie talke . The move functions work great. It comes with a load of fixings for ceiling attachment. The usb cable /power supply is a good length. Nice bit of kit. Probably going to get another.
4,very chunky but it works great i know i got a used one but i think some of my parts were missing so i can hook it to the wall
5,What a fantastic purchase!  This is my fourth camera from IeGeek.  They just seem to get it better and better each time.I am really impressed with the ease of set up and the functionality as well as the build quality and video quality.  Not only does it have motion detection but it actually follows the movement so you capture the movement of the person/animal etc.The fact that it allows you to add cloud storage is an added bonus.  If you do not wish to buy into the cloud service then this too is possible.The playback is fabulous since it can be speeded up but also the time line can be expanded so that you can look at the video in more detail!.I am really very impressed with the camera and would definitely recommend this product and in fact have already done so to a number of friends and family members.Well done guys!Whilst the USB cable is great it could be even better if it was longer - that said for my purposes it is fine.
3,The product was delivered within the quoted lead time (just) and was almost as described in the specs. But the seller does give themselves a generous amount of time.You've obviously got your customer by the balls if they're after just one of these items. The price reflects that the seller is aware of this.Diameter of the standoff was correct which is the important thing. I hadn't realised that it was actually a bit longer than it was meant to be. This caused the standoff to pass all the way through my motherboard and cause it ground on the chassis. Took me a while to figure out that the problem was with the standoff and not my new m.2 drive. Still as the other half says better too long than too short so managed to get it sorted.
4,Great value for money with really impressive performance.Pros include:- Able turn off night vision- 360 view pan and tilt function- SD storage support- Usb 2.0 powered (can switch out for longer lead)- Excellent picture quality even behind a window pane- Robust Software App (although haven't managed to get it working on Windows yet)- Two way intercom facilityCons are:- Sneaky card with package offering free SD Card for 5* review- Large form factor- Annoying lag (circa 5 seconds) when streaming/reviewing video over mobile data - hoping this can be fixed with a S/W updateAll in all is an excellent camera and very highly recommended.
4,Good camera maybe me but fiddly to get play back from sd card.... time picking element frustrating
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Camera arrived next day as expected from Amazon prime. This is a much better looking device that other cameras at this price range. It really does look very sleek. Setting up took only a few minutes. Download the app as shown in the picture then follow the instructions. It is really very simple and your phone even generates a QR code to update the camera. All very high tech! Once up an running the camera is very easy to use. For us we will use it for monitoring our cats and you can see one cat very clearly in the video. This camera is unique in the range as it includes motion tracking and will follow movement around the room. The video captures are available even when the camera is offline via the cloud service. Yet another great product from iegeek. No complaints so far at this price point.
5,This is our 9th IEGEEK camera - we have bought them for our elderly parents for our own home security and to keep an eye on our dog when we are away from the house for any length of time.We prefer the motion sensor ones - which this one is. It is really easy to set up and connect to WiFi and offers the greatest scope for the camera and covers the whole room when motion is detected.. The sensor is excellent and sends notifications to our phones when triggered. It can be over sensitive at times being triggered by changes in day light or a fly crossing the screen but the sensitivity level can be altered. All in all a great camera for an affordable price. I just wish that the option of the Cloud was a more reasonable cost as some of the features don’t work unless you purchase it.
4,Quality for the price. I bought this product to keep an eye on my pets. Does exactly that. I had it set up and fitted to the ceiling in under 10 minutes. My room is 5/6m long and the HD mode picture quality is amazing. You can zoom on the picture and the controls are easy to use.
3,Camera is good quality but it doesn't have a loop feature so if u using sd card ull need to erase memory manually it will not loop on the old videos.  So in every 7 days u will be deleting your memory card files unless u but their cloud.  Which is expensive than netflix !! Other than that.  Camera is good.  But not happy what they recently did is raised the price from 29.99 to 35.99... i bought in June and within 2 weeks they put up £5.99 !! .. i wanted 5 more camera so i guess i won't be buying from them.
5,I have installed it in one of my store  simple to fix just screw the plastic dice anywhere just be careful you have a power socket nearby . Supply power with the adopter and cable included .  Install the app on your phone and reset the camera with the help of a pin . Make sure phone is connected to the wifi and not mobile data and you can easily search and pair the camera . The video quality is very good both in the daylight and night . The camera has an extra feature that it can follow a moving object that passes in front . I have purchased a micro sd card separately and installed it on the camera for recording . If you are looking for quality video and not cheap cameras  this is your choice.
5,Everything is good. I can not say I dislike anything about it .For the prices it really good  . Got a clear picture and can control the camera from anywhere you want .
5,Bought this to keep an eye on the cat while we're away. Super easy setup. Good range of view (Well over 180 degrees). Not using the SD card or cloud and still have access to many of the functions. Can use on 4g while out and turn it on/ off remotely but the app can be a bit laggy and it takes a few taps to open things.  The Talk function is fun too.  Also my husband and I can both control the app if we log in under one account. It has a pin function to access camera and settings which is good piece of mind from a security perspective.  Will buy a second one as it's amazing value for money for what you get.
1,All sorts of issues with this product. Firstly it doesn't come with a SD card which is needed to operate it. My fault as I didn't notice this in the description but for crying out loud why sell a product that needs something else to make it work?Then I followed the 'instructions regarding the scanning of the QR code. Didn't work. Why not? Because I needed to download a QR code reading App first. Not a mega problem but would have been helpful if the instructions had mentioned this - we're not all totally savvy with technology.Then I get to the nub of the matter. I've scanned the QR code using the app. I've then found the website that this App leads you to and clicked on the App to download to my phone. Nothing happens except that after a few minutes the screen defaults back to the menu screen. Try again still nothing happens. So I manually input the website url into the phone's browser to see if I can download it in this way. The result was a message to say that the 'Domain is for sale.' In short the website for the app doesn't exist and I therefore can't download the App needed to use this kit so its had to go back.As I say in the heading of this review DO NOT BUY THIS - it is a waste of your time and money. Finally take no notice of all the comments that tell you how marvellous this product is and how easy it is to set up. Forget it these people are lying.
5,Really great camera easy to setup connect to WiFi scan with camera or type in code. Really great that you're able to turn the night vision off so it can see through a window not very clearly but much clearer than using night vision and reducing glare Also fantastic that it can utilise an auto tracker and your able to go back in time and record what has happened in a hard format. Really simple to use and very effective for my use.Highly recommend great price and good quality.My only criticism is when you allow others to utilise the functionality of the camera they're not able to use the full features this should be an option.
5,Bought to see when my child leaves for school and arrives home and to be able to check house is secure whilst out.Great little camera that does what I want it to 😀
5,Bought a couple of these for keeping a eye on the place when away.They are great easy to setup and easy to use with great quality especially for the price.
5,This is the second security camera I have purchased at Amazon. both were described as 1080P but the performance of this camera is much better - pictures sharper and copes with moving subject better. This camera also has the additional feature of tracking the moving object (person). The tracking is a little jerky but does allow you to follow the subject moving across the field of view. Some features (smart detection) are only available if you subscribe to the cloud service which I have  not done. A minor problem I have encountered is the memory card was a little difficult to remove. On the whole I feel I can recommend this camera
5,Having used previous generations of this product from ieGeek I was not disappointed with this update. I use it as a camera for the rear of my property and it works very well indeed. The night vision motion detection and picture quality is spot on and I would recommend this to anyone who want to secure their property with indoor cams. The two-way speech is also useful for speaking to the family whilst I'm at work and to check that they're all ok.
5,I have bought the Iegeek security camera and have been very happy with the purchase. The camera is very quick to respond and record HI resolution images giving total peace of mind that my home is safe whilst away.  Camera allows cloud storage at a cost but very effective. Having the 355 degree rotation on the camera is great. It allows me to chat to my family whilst away. Very helpful if you call them and ask what they need taking home. There is the option to use a 64gb micro drive where most others only go Up to 32gb. Would definately recommend. Picture quality in good or poor light is excellent.
5,- 2nd Camera purchased and happy with product - used as outdoor car camera from inside window - brilliant pics during day but night time vision not so good as its indoors - not camera fault though just the way i have set up.
5,what can i say they give a good image day and night clear and detail is good the tracking is good and the alerts are great good for keeping an eye on your car or your front door.
5,Received this today brilliant camera! I already have an ieGeek camera for the front of my house and now I have this to watch the dogs while I'm at work.Pros!- Hull HD with controls to move the camera view around to see most of the room.- Brilliant app with great features.- Easy set up with voice alert for when it is connectedCons!- Installed on a different app than the other ieGeek camera I have although this new app is better. Think I can put the other camera onto this new app but will sort that out another day.Thanks for the brilliant product!
3,Standard size stand-off (and screw) for installing m.2 drives to motherboards if your motherboard didn't come with one or you lost it (or as I did gave it away never expecting to need it).Massively overpriced for an item that probably cost a fraction of a penny to actually make.
5,Good quality camera easy to install (5mins) with no extra expense i rent an office space in a business centre where i store my inventory and for peace of mind i have been looking to install cctv in the office which would have cost me couple of 100 pounds now cost me next to nothing i can control everything from my phone plus has mic for 2 way communications and provided me 360 view of office.Does require memory card for storage or the option of registering with cloud for online storage.Has many cool features and can’t go wrong with price and service.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love this camera! I am using it in a cafe to look at the till. The camera was really easy to set up and it came with instructions which were really simple to follow! The camera is small enough to conveniently place somewhere which is really helpful as it means it can fit in more places! You can download an app and watch the footage back on your phone! So easy to use! Really happy with my purchase! Really good image quality - great security camera!
4,Good quality video excellent for 6 second burst. Unfortunately playback function is very hit or miss on the app is very difficult to operate (if not subscribing to their specific cloud network) it just switches straight to live feed.Really effective as a wildlife camera trap if you are happy with 6 second bursts.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This Camera from ieGeek is one of the best things ive brought on amazon.Easy to setup by letting the camera read a QR code from your phone.Great tracking but sometimes slow for fast vehicles.easy to playback alerts with little or no lag whether connected to wifi or 4G.This is an indoor camera but sat on the window picks up great pictures through glass.The only advice for ieGeek would be to make a waterproofed version and id buy it immediately.
5,Fabulous value considering all the functions and the additional option of Cloud storage at a reasonable price. Easy to set up and use but quite different software to previous ieGeek security cameras however very easy to learn. The Motion Tracking option is a great addition plus the enhanced sound monitoring available with the Cloud storage. Availability in other colours especially black would be an advantage. One especial extra is the option to toggle the night vision IR light - meaning the camera is less obvious and it doesn’t pick up reflections from glass if it is used to monitor through windows.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Purchased this WiFi  connected cctv for inside of a commercial workshop. Very easy to install on the app.  Set up in about 5mins.  I've mounted it upside down on my ceiling  the software allows you to reverse the pics.  Smart detection good. And image quality is superb.  Cable is about 1m so can reach the nearest socket. I've got 3 over external iegeek cans and this is up there with quality as the other models
5,This is a great bit of kitespecially considering the low price compared to some of the other cameras on the market. The picture quality is excellentthe motion tracking and pan/tilt works superbly. I was suprised how easy it is to set up connect to the Wi-Fi and link it to the app. I havent tried the night vision yet but because every over function has been spot on so far im certain this will also work very well. All in all i am very pleased with it and would recommend it to any potential buyers.
4,Haven't tried night vision yet.Decent picture qualityMotion detection only seems to do left and right not up and downHappy with the product though
5,Great little camera especially for the price! Using to keep an eye on the cars so the camera has been placed indoor through a window. This does mean you get a reflection but if you place it as close as possible to the window this isn’t a huge problem. Set up was easy even for someone who is not great with technology! The app is great too.
5,Great for the price I have it set up behind my living room window and the reflection is only an issue with the night vision as it reflects back the lights but I only need it for daytime so not an issue for meIt was easy to set up and you can change the settings to what you needGreat little device and looks nice and modernPicture quality is good as you can clearly see everything and it also follows the moving objectWould recommend
5,This is the second Igeek camera i have bought to monitor mum with Alzheimers. Small and compact and good picture and sound Quality. Worth the money and is good value.
5,I’m using the camera to check my dog while I’m on holiday and I’m working.It is perfect. Excellent image quality and sound.
5,Fabulous for seeing the front of the house when your out. Great for keeping your eye on the kid's when they stay over and you need to keep an eye on them  but don't want to disturb them by looking in on them. Just plug it in then set up through the app and hey presto you are connected to your camera wherever you are !!
5,Easy to set the camera up just follow the app which guides you through each step. Mine is in my Lounge room facing the front door and turns on if someone enters the house. The mic is really good and I can hear the kids even when in the kitchen two rooms away. The app is easy to use and you can move the camera using the app. I am happy with my purchase and am thinking of getting a second camera.
5,Brilliant you can see who's coming and going
4,Die Lieferung wurde für den Folgetag versprochen kam aber erst einen Tag später an. Hätte ich das vorher gewusst wäre ich in den Laden gefahren aber gut nun ist SIe da
5,These are very good cameras easy to setup and very good picture quality. The app is also very reliable and much better than most other CCTV camera apps I have used. The cameras work well locally.. or using data when out and about. I only had one issue with them which was promptly sorted out within hours. Customer service are also very attentive and reply fast to any issues. Recommended.
5,Good quality Camera. It is very nice for it rotates up and down and left and right. It has good sound quality too. The camera is clear and automatic sets up the night and adjusting the light when it is dark. Setup was easy very easy to follow steps. Download the app connect to wi-fi and follow the instruction on the app to pair camera. Works great!!! Very effective when we are away we can monitor the house.
5,This is my second iegeek camera my other is an outdoor camera and also excellent.This camera was just what I wanted it works perfect through windows with no glare and the night vision is also fab I’ve tried it in a few places and through a window with very little light perfect.This camera talks you through the set up has a motion and human detection options and was really easy to set up. I fully recommend this camera.
5,Great for monitoring the dogs when we are out. Got three now will be getting more.
4,Beautifully packed and presented and an easy set up. Pictures in daylight really clear not sure about in fading light or looking through the widow yet.So far pleased.
5,Bought this item as a security camera for a holiday home and it does the job at a very reasonable price. The picture quality is very good and you can rotate the camera from a phone app. Night vision is fine if combined with a security light.
5,First of all I would like to say if your hesitating to get this camera Dont! It is amazing for the price! it is so easy to set up you just have to download an app and then follow the process which takes about 1-2 minutes. The camera is very quiet and the picture quality is very impressive! I am very pleased with this camera and wouldn't hesitate to buy another one :)
4,Good camera and easy to use app. Just a shame it clicks so loud when changing from normal to night vision. Overall would recommend
5,Works as listed.
4,So far so good; very easy to set up and quality of picture is V good. However no response to minor email query.
5,I bought this camera for use as baby monitor and also for security purposes when we are away. It does the job as described. Comes with its own charging plug and wire also can be used without cable once charged. Motion detection and object works great. Also has two way audio function though I only use it one way to hear the baby cry. Would recommend.
5,Lovely little  camera.Bought for husband for Christmas. He was well Pleased. Just what we needed to keep a eye on back garden .Easy to set up
5,I am delighted with this camera and use it to monitor my cat while I am away from home. Easy to set up it alerts on any movement and even physically tracks the moving object. Night vision is also effective. The only slight frustration is that when it is tracking the noise (buzz) of the motor blanks out the microphone.
5,Cet accessoire permet de connecter à 1 port AV de TV plusieurs consoles. Cela évite de brancher / débrancher les consoles et le switch permet de passer de l'une à l'autre.Livré avec un câble AV pour branche le switch à la TV.
5,Installed and running in minutes and now tracking camera on my phone tablet and pc. The motion detection is very good and the video is recorded and uploaded to the cloud in real-time (I paid for the cloud subscription - $5.99 for 3 months + 1 month free). You can even set the camera to follow the motion.
5,HelloWhat a great bit of kit easy to setup straight out the box.perfect instructions no issues lovely packaging.been using this for over a week now really smooth and clean.great functions and works every time.would recommend. Can keep and eye and talk to me dogs now from anywhere.Get one now. really recommend!
1,As long as you have a 2GHz only wifi network this camera is fine. But if you have a modernish home mesh network hub (e.g. BT WholeHome or Google Wifi) then this wont work because of the weird way it establishes a WiFi connection. Note that the mesh routers mentioned do have a 2Ghz connection (which the camera says it supports) but the camera still cant connect to it. Nerdy tech reason: the camera is configured via an app running on a phone; it connects to whatever Wifi network network the phone is connected to; modern mesh home routers will use the same network SSID for both the 2GHz and 5GHz networks; and your phone will usually automatically connect to the 5Ghz one; meaning that the camera only has the option of connecting to the 5GHz one. If your router has the ability to seperate the 2G and 5G networks then youll be fine.
1,Do not buy this as it was working fine until they updated the apps both on android and ios and  since then no notifications on phone. Left reviews on both apple store and Google play and no replies. Support non existent.
4,Bought this as a present for my husband. It's really good but he is having problems synching it through blue tube so has had to use the lead provided . The sound is really good and doesn't distort when turned up loud and all in all he is well pleased with it.
5,The camera works well. Easy to set up night vision automated motion detector which you can customise and feel safer at home. Great customer service from vendor.
5,Ordered three  of these cameras to keep an eye on my Mam...as she is in her 90’s. Arrived promptly...very easy to set up and the quality is amazing...both through the day and on night mode. Would recommend these cameras to anyone thinking of buying them.
5,I bought two of this product due to a recent burglary. Having set the cameras up. I am know reassured that these cameras will do a job for me. The picture quality is fantastic. And I would reccomend buying if looking for a not to expensive CCTV camera.
5,Arrived on time. Easy to set up. Cloud a bit pricey £99 for year but seems to work well.  Happy with purchase for price
5,Great little camera very clear and better than I expectedeasy to set up software not to bad either don't hesitate go buy one.
5,I bought this camera a couple of weeks ago to keep an eye on our new puppy while we were at the shops from time to time.Brilliant. I can't fault it. It gave us piece of mind. For the price it is amazing. Completely recommend it.
5,I love this camera it is exactly what I was looking for for my home to give it and me some extra protection. The picture and use of the app is excellent. So easy to use. I’ve already recommended it to many of my friends
5,Arrived quickly with minimal packaging so less waste. The camera was easy to set up and comes with all the cables including a plug. The picture quality is amazing and the fact that there is a 360 rotation is fantastic. Very happy with this product.
5,Easy to set up. A free months trial for the cloud. Excellent picture day and night & great customer service too. Choices for multiple settings such as night vision abnormal sound and a slot for a sd card. WiFi connected.

5,Easy to set up helpful for me to keep an eye on my parked car. Thank you.

1,Good picture but stops working doesn't turn. I have to keep resetting the power.
5,Very happy with the first three so when I needed a fourth camera it was a simple decision to buy the same again. Prompt delivery easy to set up all working fine. Good customer support too
5,After trying a couple of diffrent cameras this one is by far the best easy set up pan and tilt nice clear picture the app is very good easy to navigate I would recommend this camera .
1,This camera is junk I've only been using this for the second day and while I can see the camera moving when motion is detected I am getting no alerts and henceforth the video is not being recorded. This is terrible as you will never catch anyone or anything on something which is supposed to be a security camera. It looks like a lot of the reviews on this are fake I wish I knew this before buying it. I will be returning this ASAP it is almost unusable.
1,Not happy with this purchase will be returning keep getting the alerts but cannot view them even after I have paid for the cloud subscription as I don’t have a memory card which if you pay for the cloud you don’t need a memory card! Picture quality on live stream is good but just not happy not being able to view alerts. Very disappointing!
1,A word of warning to anyone thinking of buying this camera. With their latest app update you are no longer allowed to store alerts on sd card they force you to pay for an expensive cloud subscription. Their support is also non existent there is no option to connect with a human being just a useless faq on their site.
5,Bought this camera to watch dog when we are out of house.Great design easy to set up android app clear and good to use.Would recommend for 1st time users of indoor cameras

1,Bought 3 of these for my new home and total waste of money!!!!Once get it connected after inserting sd card which is pointless as wont just record to sd card you have to subscribe  to their ****ing cloud to get all the features an I have 3 which would be £60 month total rip off and a con!!!!
5,Great little security camera highly recommend!!
1,3 days after the return window closed it has stopped working.the Camera has been on all day whilst I have been in and out of the room and it did not trigger once.The alerts come through more than 10 minutes after detection. It is useless device despite the reviews which makes one wonder hoe genuine the reviews are.
5,Excellent product extremely user friendly App
5,Great price does what it says
1,Could not get on with it
5,Excellent  camera

1,After 40ish days  stop Recording . Its freezing so oftem and needs restart Im abset.
1,The sound and mic not working unless you buy the cloud... bulshit i would say.. useless
1,Returned as faulty picture fine but no sound.Tried everything but no sound.Also dragged broadband speed down.
1,Lead did not work
1,他社の同等の商品は3000円前後で買えることを思うと非常に高価な金額の設定である。海外他社のサイトで見るとUSD80程度で買えるため(これでも高い)、16000円はぼり過ぎである。Sling Box向けということで購入したが、他社のものをお勧めする。
4,Both batteries were fine and easy to install. The only issue I have is that I ordered 2 items but did not receive 2 complete sets of installation tools. The plastic pry tool was pretty much finished after the first battery and was toast after the second battery.
5,so far so good...much more reasonably priced than Sony.
5,Leaving my dog's home alone whilst at work is a hard thing to do even having a dog walker in. I have tried lots of different cameras in the past but this has got to be the best one I've ever had. The picture quality is clear. it's very easy to setup and use. the app is easy you can move the camera around the room completely. night vision is clear.. also gives you peace of mind of who is coming in and out of your house. I can talk to my dogs. I can take pictures of what they're doing at that moment in time. The video function is good and you can go back to whatever time you want to check up on throughout the day with the auto record. Motion detection so you can see if anything is going on that shouldn't be as you know with dogs they could be getting up to anything. This camera really gives you peace of mind. Even when I went to lunch today I was notified that motion was detected from the camera so when I had a look the dogs were barking at the door so I knew somebody had been I spoke to the dogs through the camera and they calmed down a lot quicker than usual. For the price it's a bargain. I love love love it
5,Great camera! Very good picture quality. The night vision is great! Super easy to setup and operate I installed an SD card and indeed it records longer time. Very impressive.
5,Great Camera easy to set up and Link toExcellent picture and motion dectionability to turn off IR at night is a big plus if you need to Use through a window. records to SD card and playback via Android App and Windows.General motion dection works well However if you need the Specific "Human detection" feature you need to purchase Cloud storage to activate it. This also applies to "Abnormal Sound" and "Baby Crying Detection"  so if you need these features then you will have to subscribe.The 64GB SD card recording is all I required  so its a very Good Camera great picture and does the job it was purchased for
5,Great bit of equipment easy to set up move around etc
