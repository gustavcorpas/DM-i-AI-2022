5,The whole world is moving to battery operated cars but there is no environmentally sound way to conveniently dispose of them.  This breaks the dependence.  Love it!!
5,The Belker adapter was just what I needed to charge an antique Christmas decoration that required low voltage. Not many adapters have this range of voltage and I was happy that this one worked.
5,Battery charger and audio recorder power supply
5,Got it to replace the "missing" adapter for a music chime box.Has the right power settings and terminals as well as the right polarity. Made Pop very happy that we could get it working as another momento of Mom.Got this "bookmarked for the next"missing" one!
4,I bought this to replace a lost and discontinued power cord.  It offers a wide range of output voltages and connections but it's only good for 1A and I needed 2.
5,I repair and restore "old" electronics and quite often the things that arrive on my workbench these days are cell phones laptops and other small portable devices that are salvaged- pulled from attics garages and oftentimes quite literally from the garbage and as such rarely have compatible power supplies when they reach me. While most modern devices all run on similar voltages and plugs this is not the case for many older devices. This means I used to have to keep many power supplies on hand to handle their specific requirements. For me this meant a good-sized plastic tub full of mismatched adapters and power supplies for all the various devices I might come across. Then I finally had a device cross the bench that I didn't have a power supply for- and that's when I found this thing from Belker.It's a wall wart power supply with an LED to tell you it's running an average-length cable and a construction quality roughly equal to the average cell phone charger- it's nothing special but it's not going to fall apart either. It comes with a whole bag of male connectors for a variety of common size plugs which is handy as you can swap between them pretty easily. Then the thing's big feature- you can change the power output by turning the dial on the bottom of the supply. It comes with a "key" (though any slotted screwdriver will do the job) to physically set the voltage output- it's stiff enough you will need a tool so it can't "change" unless you physically do it which is good. This means I can quickly switch between heads and voltages on one power supply rather than dig for the right one or have to spend a bunch of time wiring something together on the workbench. This thing saves time effort and for me at least eliminates one major source of me getting shocked which is a big deal for me.  This device specifically filled the role of a much more expensive specialty power supply so for me at least the value is considerable that way as well.For me and my needs this thing is a no-brainer tool. Virtually any small electronic device can be powered up with this thing from small electronics holiday decorations toys tools and so on. Reducing a whole bin of odds and ends to one device a bag of it's connector ends- all of which tucks into a drawer is a major improvement to my work space and work flow going forward. The only way I can see this thing falling short is that it's not rated for larger devices and while the male plug set that is included is great it's not exhaustive- this set isn't going to completely replace every niche item nor a good bench power supply for the things this can't do. But as a compliment to the aforementioned bench supply there won't be too much you can't handle from a power perspective.I give this one two big thumbs up!
5,I bought this adapter to  power  my Arlo Home Base unit. (because the original adapter was damaged) It was easy to turn to it to the 12 V setting and it is working great. It was also reasonably priced considering it's versatility.
5,good item. good price
5,I check the voltage ranges with a multi-meter . All with limits they advertise.Good selection of tips.
5,I bought this for a fan and it works awesome. It is a my go to for anything missing a cord now.
5,The multiple options for power and tips made this work when others didn't.
3,https://www.amazon.com/Belker-Converter-Universal-B013UJAZY8-B078LSVVTB/dp/B08K2S1D11This adapter DOES NOT reverse tip polarity (+) tip only no (-) tip polarity without additional $7 cable purchase listed above.Adapters have been made for over 20 years that have this feature built in.  It would have been easy for them to do either: a) add a polarity selector switch on the adapter (like they do for the voltages) or b) have the tip connector be able to be plugged in either direction.Now I have to spend extra money to get it to work with my (-) negative tipped polarity speaker that I bought this for.
4,I bought this unit to replace a failed power supply for a ReliOn Blood Pressure Monitor.  The unit has a selector to choose output voltages between 3 and 12 volts DC which covers the range of almost everyone's needs.  The provided kit contains a selection of various size male connectors and a very small key to move the voltage selector.  The problem is that the selector is extremely stiff and most users will not have enough strength to move the selector with the key.  The solution is to use a flat blade screwdriver instead of the key and exert whatever force is necessary to turn the selector.  I was worried that the required force would break the selector but it eventually turned as it should.  The second thing to know is that the unit's power cord is only about five feet long.  Be sure it will be long enough for your particular application.Overall this unit is good value for its price and it is nice to have such a wide choice of output voltages and sizes of male connectors.  If it weren't for the difficulty in moving the voltage selector this unit would rate a straight five stars.
4,Good replacement universal adapter. However it does not have a polarity reverser built in so you might have to buy one to be able to use it like I have.
4,I love the fact that I can charge so many things! I had purchased a massage gun on Amazon several months back and ( of course ) lost the charger. I’ve been trying to get the manufacturer’s attention/ web site/ customer service basically anyone or anything to help me with no results. Amazon also no results so this is Fantastic!! Love it everything about it.
5,Exactly what I needed and for a great price still working haven't had any problems
4,Bought this to replace my 4.5v battery back that came with my mini LED/RGB Yule Tree at work.The good: It removes the need for batteriesIt makes the lights shine a bit brighter.The bad: So far the only issue i had with is turning the settings dial. It was stuck enough to bend the key that came with it and require me to use a sturdier metal object to turn it. That caused a bit of damage to the dial but it is where it needs to be and i wont have to move it again and glad i didn't need to move it further.So far no shock no melting or overheating others have claimed but with my issue it makes me wonder about QC. Only had it plugged in two days so far with the tree turned on for only 8 hours each day so i will see about longevity.
3,being able to switch polarity would  be nice
5,I have 2 very small tape recorders. The adapter works with one but not the other. They are both 3V. The one it doesn't fit is the recorder I bought it for.
5,I love how it has around 6 different interchangeable plugs to fit into any size whole you need and make it versatile for most things that need a plug without always having to buy a new one cause the old don't fit. I also love it goes from 3v to 12v all you need to do is turn the switch on the back of the plug for the vault tou need and it works great especially for the deal and everything it comes with and the different voltage options. Cant beat it and it works fantastic! And no worries of burning it out cause of wrong vault or anything. Plan to buy another cause I have many Halloween stuff and decorations this would come in hand for.
4,It's a perfectly good product - I like the idea of providing the choice among several different sizes of plug.Unfortunately none of them fit my computer.
5,I have cats that like to chew on wires and cords. They ended up chewing on the power cord to an Xbox One controller recharger station. I was able to buy this adapter to replace the power cord instead of having to spend almost twice as much to replace the whole recharger station! Plus if I can use this power adapter on almost any other electronic device that I need to. And this time I made darn sure that the cats can;t get to the cords!Small side note: while the adapter for the recharger worked it ended up being a slightly higher profile than the original but putting little felt sticky-backed furniture floor savers on the bottom of the charger station solved that problem and even made it better as now the unit doesn't slide around on the entertainment unit.
5,After years of abuse and falling off our nightstand the power adapter on our baby monitor finally broke.  I bought this to replace it and it's been terrific.  For all the people who complain that they can't get their batteries to charge or whatnot wattage is important!  A 40 watt bulb throws a LOT less light than a 100 watt bulb.  A 12 watt adapter allows a lot less power through than a larger wattage one.  Make sure you get the correct wattage for whatever you're trying to power or it's not going to work.  This is a power adapter for small electronics.  It comes with a ton of different connectors they're plenty long enough and they attach to the power cord securely.  We've had no issues with the plug getting warm or choosing the right voltage - the dial to choose voltage is easy to turn but won't move by itself.  Overall this was significantly cheaper than buying a new video monitor and will continue to be useful even after we retire the monitor we're using it for.
5,I needed to replace an a/c adapter that broke but a replacement was not available from the company. While searching the internet I came across this universal adapter. I wasn't sure if this would do the job because the adapter I had did not clearly state it's size and it's manufacturer did not include any documentation. So I just took a leap of faith and purchased this universal adapter with positive results.Pros:- Easy to use just read the voltage from your old a/c adapter and use the key to set it on the universal adapter- Seems to work with most small electronics (for laptops you probably need another adapter with bigger adapters and more wattage)- Has many adapters so hopefully one of them applies to your deviceCons:- So far I don't see any major cons maybe the adapter heads could be a little more compact. I will post any updates if I come across anything.Overall it worked for me but it would be nice if everyone got on board and used a usb type connection so that we can share a/c adapters between devices.
4,This little universal adapter works well comes with plenty of connector sizes and includes a tool for adjusting voltage.Unfortunately it only allows for positive-tip configurations because the connectors are keyed to only connect in one polarization. I guess this was done to prevent people from connecting the microUSB connector in the wrong orientation but they could have rounded out the other connectors so that both configurations were possible. Having said this I almost always need positive tip and so this is not a big deal for me. Still given that my old adapters allow for both (and are designed to do so) I was surprised this one didn't.
5,Works perfect and it a great value for the money. Recommend buying it.
5,I bought this when I blew up my adapter on my sound machine I travel with.  I travel about 40% of the year so I need it.  I  did use it for a while with the batteries but they were a pain to recharge.  This worked as I needed it to.  I gave it 5 stars as I got exactly what I ordered and it works.  I would love to have it where the prongs fold.  Minor but I'd love it.
5,I used this power supply for my store sign and it works great. Make sure the polarity matches before using.Mine matched and the power supply works fine.
4,I purchased this plug as a replacement for a power supply for my stationary bike. It worked perfectly. The only issue I had was that the switch to change the voltage is difficult to turn. You will need a flat head screwdriver to turn the switch. You can't use your fingernail.The plug adapters lock in tight. It was a little hard to snap in but once I snapped it in it held tight. Make sure you check the diagram on the plug you are replacing for the correct polarity. If you don't know what am I am talking about make sure the "+" and "-" diagram on the plug is the same picture. If it is the opposite you could fry your device.
5,The actual voltages on the one I received are 3.29V - 4.60V - 5.10V - 6.25V - 7.56 - 9.23 - 12.44I'm going to use this on the 4.5V setting and it will draw .75AI'll update this review if it quits working.
4,I needed a charger for a lantern works great. Ready to try other things.
3,What I didn’t like about this product popping them in and out was a little bit difficult. Another thing I didn’t like about this it was heavy when it was put into the electronics it didn’t stay put inside. When it did stay in it meant a little. The thing I liked about it the light feature the red light. The thing I didn’t like about the red light and it stayed on. To improve it the red light It needs to go off when electronica is fully charged. That’s a feature they need to put in there  other than that we’re good for my knees if you wanted to stay in one place on the table otherwise do not buy this product only to use when you travel that is the best way to use it because you can plug it in and let it stay in one spot while you’re taking a shower it is quick For me.I would recommend you buy it even with the bad comment I made but it’s not good for long-term use in home only good for like traveling for a long term used bye
4,Happy to be able to use my LED desk lamp after its cord went bad.  I can also use this on a different setting for charging my phone.  You have to switch power settings on the plug depending on what you are using the cord for and the instructions could be more clear about how that works.  I had to use trial and error to find the right setting.
5,The Belker AC Adapter is well designed and made. Included are many plugs providing connectivity with many devices using DC volts from 1.5 to 6.0. Each plug has a different diameter that works with each device ensuring the proper connection. A small screwdriver-like device is included to change the voltage. Each voltages is clearly marked and the switch has discrete stops. The customer service is excellent as well. Warning: If the plug is inserted all the way it will be difficult to remove. If one wants to use the adapter with different devices don't insert the plug all the way. A bonus: a micro USB plug is also included making this a very  versatile power source.
4,I got this cord because my half sisters got a portable DVD player from a garage sale which only came with the car power cord but no standard outlet one.The reason why I got because it has multiple tips and not sure what size tip it needs. So instead of buying multiple cords and hoping that one will fit but it was easier to buy a multiple tip cord then buying multiple cords for a chance that one will fit.I'm only giving it 4 stars because it didn't come with a instructions and had to explain how it works
4,My old wall wart adapter measured about 3.74 mm od. With this new one neither the smaller or bigger adapter would fit.  The old adapter used two small identical diameter prongs. I had to cut the cables and splice the old adapter onto the new units cord.
3,Notice this reference in the description: "The polarity of DC plug is inner Positive(+) outer Negative(-)." Like most people I didn't have a clue what this meant but assumed one of the many adapter plugs would fit my Brother label maker that eats batteries for breakfast. Alas I was wrong. There is a tiny symbol next to the power plug hole on most gadgets. It has 3 circles one that's positive one that's negative and one that's solid. If the pattern doesn't exactly match this charger it won't work for that device regardless of the plug size. You are MUCH better off getting a "dual polarity" adapter that lets you select an adapter plug (like this product) PLUS the voltage amount (like this product) PLUS the polarity (unlike this product). It's kind of like buying an ancient extension cord that doesn't have space for a third prong. Why get the limited version when you really need a multitasker? The whole point is flexibility. The techy warning was lost of me. Don't make the same mistake I did... Dual polarity is the way to go. Keep looking.
4,Received it in good time.  I'm sure it works but the item i bought it for ended up not accepting the charge after being plugged in overnight so I think the item it was bought for was bad.  One of these days I'm sure I'll have something to use the Belker Charger so that it will get used.
5,I love the versatility of having multiple ends to attach virtually any electronic device at various wattage! It's a life saver for recharging almost anything!
4,It's interesting how I can use this for multiple appliances. The only reason it's 4 stars is because I find it strange that the dial doesn't lock onto each voltage number. I'm worried that it might be either a defect or something that might cause an issue in the future if I accidentally turn it a millimeter too far from where it's supposed to be.
5,This is one of the best products I have bought on Amazon. I needed a replacement plug for my make-up mirror and this was perfect.
5,I have a pair of stereo speakers that came with an HP lcd monitor that I purchased in 2006.  They are powered by a cord that plugs into a DC source socket in the back of the monitor.  I had to replace the monitor so I needed an adapter that could supply up to 1 amp 12v DC and had a compatible plug.  This item has all that I need - I was able to choose a plug that fit from the selection that they sent and setting the voltage is easy.  Been using it for a month now with no issues.  Recommended.
5,Several weeks ago we experienced an electrical power surge at our house and the AC DC adapter for my weather radio was fried.  I needed an adapter with an output of at least 9v and 300mA and this 12 watt universal one by Belker was just what I needed since I could change the output voltage by simply turning the dial on the back.  It works just great!  I also really like the fact that it has a little LED status light on the front of it to show me that it's working.
5,I purchased this to power a battery powered lamp that did not come with a cord (but had an input.) I’ve been using it for over a month and it has been great! No more running through batteries! I also like that I will be able to use it with other items I don’t have cords for!
5,Update: Its been months and it works SO WELL that we BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE to have around the house since we leave the other one plugged into the sound machine for the baby. The extra one came in really handy when we went on a road trip and realized we had lost the cord for the dvd player. We could plug this one into the car and it worked great!Bought it for a sound machine that came without the cord (bought it from a store that sells overstock and returned items for cheap called Dirt Cheap) and couldnt return it so we thought we’d just try to find a cord that fit. Found this and it was easy to use and worked like a charm. I was pleasantly surprised.
4,The universal power adapter works but it doesn't allow for reversed polarity of the positive and negative flow. Older designs used to allow the polarity to be reversed. That said this unit will power most modern appliances.
4,Worked just for what I needed it for! Great cord and does its job but does make a strange buzzing sound that is clearly audible but not overwhelming.
5,Solved the problem I needed solved for a decoration.
5,I lost the power cord to a few of my items mainly my old camcorder which this was used for. There is a good variety of tips so this is sure to fit whatever you need. It has a voltage adjuster on the back so you can set it to meet your devices requirements. The adjuster key that is comes with is in the bag with all of the tips and makes it very easy to switch. Great multi use power suppy to have around the house.
5,Quality product. Works as advertised. Prompt delivery. Used on a vintage merry-go-round
4,Works well but I would have been more pleased if it had a polarity reverse switch. The only way to reverse polarity is to order an adapter. Of course that could be a marketing ploy.
3,Wasn't what I thought when I ordered I returned it.
4,I bought this for my aunt to use with her old school cd walkman. Works great and was easy to figure out which adapter to use. My only complaint is that it was delivered a day later than promised which normally wouldn’t be a big deal but I was visiting her in a different state (and wanted the adapter shipped there); it arrived about 10 minutes before I had to leave for the airport so I barely had time to show her how to use it. Other than the shipping issue it works as described.
5,It has several adapters produced the stated voltage and was a great price. It also has an LED on the base that lights when it is receiving power. It does not heat up. I bought this charger for an old clock radio and it works well. I was concerned the plugs would not fit but it was just perfect. Very happy. If you find my review helpful please make sure to click the helpful button! Thanks!
3,Not one of the DC connectors fit the center post of my device's DC input. Beyond that the adapter did not put out the DC voltage that its adjustment dial indicates. My volt meter registered 4.5 V when the dial was set to 5 V. The saving grace was that placing the dial halfway between 5 V and 6 V yielded 5 Volts.The adapter "manual" is limited and printed in 6 point font. (Typical!)Available Internet documentation on DC connectors is sparse at best and doesn't describe how to properly measure the connectors' dimensions. So ordering is hap-hazard. With stores being closed during the pandemic it is not possible to go in and match a connector to the device.
5,Apparently during my move I lost the cord to my speaker/charger. I happened across this particular cord. The reviews were decent so I made the purchase.  It definitely achieved its purpose.Note:  Be sure to use the tool given to change to the voltage you need otherwise it will not work.  Thank me later!
5,What I liked about this product was that I was able to use it as a replacement for the original adapter that I lost!  Because of the many pieces (adapters) that come with this product I can use it on many different electronic devices which makes this product even better than what I thought!  It’s universal so it can adapt to just about anything!  I’m very pleased with my new purchase and recommend highly!  Thanks Amazon my go to place whenever I need something they are sure to have it at a decent price!!
5,I don't understand why the "sensitivity filter" has selected my review to place it in the "hidden" category. It even got 34 helpful ratings. Why would you hide this excellent review?Excellent product. Good price. Recommended.CAUTION: Be extremely careful that you select the correct voltage BEFORE plugging your device onto this power supply. The voltage indicator has a VERY small arrowhead that can easily be overlooked. If you will take the time to rotate the indicator fully counterclockwise until it stops that will be 3 volts. Fully clockwise is 12 volts. Now you are fully oriented to the scale and ready to choose and set your desired voltage. Enjoy.NOTE: The polarity is center positive and is NOT reversible so check your device before ordering.BONUS: This model is limited to 12 watts output. Belker also makes a similar supply which allows up to 30 watts output and only costs $1 more. Choose wisely.
4,Needed to replace broken plug.. This worked perfectly..
5,The guy I bought didn’t have its plug and this one worked perfectly.
4,😁👌👍
4,Would have liked to have been able to also choose polarity but it is working for what I needed.
5,I’ve always had my doubts about these little connectors of the many that I’ve tried. They’ve always broke within a few weeks due to weak connections and it’ll start to wobble then all the wires inside would not connect anymore. This one had changed my mind about these. Everything fit snugged and the connection seemed strong every time I switched heads. Satisfied. Not wiggly or loose. Try it!
5,I purchased this product to replace power supply for an HP Simplesave 1T external drive that went missing and it works perfectly.  I love the versatility of the product as well - several voltage options and plug adapters that can be used safely for other electronics with missing power supplies.  Great value!
4,Arrived on time used immediately works fine.4 sted of 5 due to small cardboard box instead ofdisplayed packed on web no big deal reallysave energy save bulk save the planet.Happy customer.
5,We recently purchased a toddler power quad and it didn’t have the charger for it. We decided to give this charger a try and it works great! We love that we can use it on different thing with all of the other attachments it comes with. Delivery was fast and we are happy with our purchase.
5,Everybody has 12VDC or 19VDC wall warts laying around the house (they seem to multiply like bunnies) but when my wife brought me a small fan and asked if I had a wall wart for it I immediately started working on how to make one of the existing work.  Instead I went on line and found this device.  It was perfect for my application and with a terrific price.  Quick delivery no taped up external voltage divider and most importantly the wife is happy!!!!
4,The largest adapter plug would not fit my Black and Decker cordless drill so unit is unusable for what I bought it for.The unit looks very versatile if the plugs will fit what you need.
1,Boy I was excited to get this in to use it on my handheld sewing machine. I knew the voltage of the sewing machine is 6 so I set it to 6. I picked the correct "head" and NOTHING. I triple-checked everything on the sewing machine and there was no issue with the sewing machine. Thinking maybe the handheld sewing machine was defective I decided to try the Belker product on my Bluetooth USB speaker. The speaker uses a different voltage with a different head; therefore I made those necessary changes. Guess what? NOTHING. It didn't work! I then plugged in my regular charging cord that comes with my speaker to verify it DOES charge and that it works and it worked just fine. I DO have to mention that the "green light" on the Belker adapter DOES come on; however I think something is off with the "heads" that I was sent. I’m guessing that the "fit" of the heads are off or not the right size. For TWO different devices with two different heads and two different voltages to not work IS VERY UNUSUAL. It's being returned.
5,I bought this to go along with a christmas present. The little santa house I bought from jerrys didn't come with a power port (I don't know why) I was very worried that this wasn't going to work (It says to buy the same brand on the box) I plugged it right in and boom. It blew up... Just kidding It worked perfect. A bonus is It came with so many plug-in options incase I run into this issue again.
3,I bought this to replace a Ryobi 4V screwdriver charger. I liked the assortment of pin adapters and the tiny screwdriver to change the voltage setting. But I was surprised that the D-shape of the adapter sleeves only let you use plug them in in one polarity. I needed reverse polarity and had to push and deform the adapter into the main plug to get it to seat. So the reverse polarity worked fine but I didn't like that this important feature isn't built in.NOTE: the lack of polarity reversal is listed in the description. But its still odd that its not included as a feature.
2,My order was not packaged correctly. Instead of getting ONE 3.5*1.35mm and ONE 4.0*1.7mm adapter I was shipped TWO 3.5*1.35mm and ZERO 4.0*1.7mm adapters. As it happens my first need is for that 4.0*1.7mm adapter. Thus I have a product with adapter plugs that I cannot use at the moment. Money wasted. Therefore it is NOT easy to use NOT versatile and NOT much value for the money. All because of poor inventory and quality control at the factory.
4,This was a great product but unfortunately didn’t work with appliance I purchased it for. I returned without any problem.
5,Old Power adapter had bad wiring.  Used to power up CD Walkman that is over 40 years old...still works!
1,We intended to use this as a charger for our baby monitor but it wouldn't charge it. When plugged in it provided the monitor with electricity but when unplugged monitor was still dead. Then we plugged it into the camera because we leave that plugged in all the time anyway. The camera then had horrible picture when it still has a great picture if plugged into the original charger. Waste of money
5,This is a really sweet adapter set. I have been a big fan of Belkin for a long time and it is good to see that they have maintained their quality throughout. This adapter replaces one that served a Sony wireless headphone set (#920) whose Sony adapter developed a frayed connector. One of the connectors of the Belkin set fit perfectly and I am back up-and-running. A nice touch is that the adapter itself has a power light indicating an active connection.
3,You do have to read the details on this to find you can't change the polarity of the tip.  My need is for a center negative.  Yes it is an older electronic item that I have but I can't for the life of me understand why any manufacturer would make a power supply like this that doesn't permit switching polarity since all the tips are changeable.  I mean they actually had to go out of their way to prevent changing polarity.  The power supply looks pretty solid so I'll probably keep it and reverse the wiring myself.  For that reason I gave it 3 stars.
4,Needed to replace a dead power cable for my router and found this. Took several minutes trying each alternate head to see which one will fit my router because there was not a provided manual for the list of sizes and their corresponding image. Power cable offered different heads for various uses and different voltages. It was very hard to turn the voltage switch even with a proper toolTldr: Item needs a picture reference for sizes and switch needs to be easier to turn but overall useful
5,Saw that it was going to cost me $20 for a replacement Power Supply for an old hard drive I needed to get data off of.  It did the trick marvelously for $10.  It allowed me to trash the old hard drive and to use for future use when I cannot find the proper plug for a device.  The key is a bit hard to move voltage settings.  Probably not suitable for users that do not have very good use of their hands.
5,My shipping scale's wireless readout has always needed a weird three AA batteries to power it.  After trying out the nice high-capacity rechargeables here it did NOT like them and just started eating batteries way too fast.  Got this since it could be set the the same 4.5V as the three AA batteries.  Snipped and stripped the wire checked polarities (the wire with white striping is positive for reference) drilled out a small entry hole in the casing of the readout and notched the wall mount to match and wedged the wire ends in behind the appropriate battery terminals.  Superglued everything in place so it stays put.  So far?  Works perfectly and no more battery costs!
5,A house bound friend has a novelty turntable/AM/FM radio whose power supply got damaged.  After piecing it together with epoxy and patience it tested to be a few volts higher than it was rated.  The company that made the turntable is no longer in business so an exact replacement was nowhere to be had ( we really tried).This  Belker Power Supply was ordered I checked the setting for the correct voltage and now our friend can spin vinyl againConsumer Dave
5,I got this as a Power Supply mainly for the Used Sharper Image Literati E-Reader that I got at a Flea Market and after putting in the correct tip to fit and setting the arrow to 5V. It charged and essentially brought my Literati back to life. Thanks :D
3,The directions need better explanation and pictures. It took trial and error time to choose the right devise plug-in and correct voltage on plug switch.  Eventually the product worked with my Brookstone Sleep Pro but did not work with a small aromatic oil defuser...even though they both needed the same 12 volt DC wall plug and even though they both used the same devise plug-in attachment.
5,The is serving my purpose. I bought two battery operated lights that operates on  four D cell batteries each. The batteries only  a week so I bought two of these power supplies and rigged them to use instead of the batteries. the only problem I found is that one read 6 volts on the 5 volt output so I used  the 4.5 output which read 5 volts because I want it below 6.
5,...and each has worked within specs.  Belker is one of the good ones.
5,I was looking for an adapter for a treadmill that was gifted to me  wasn’t too sure what specific adapter was needed or the voltage  ordered this which just made everything easier ! Figured things after I received this product & it’s definitely worth the money rather than worrying if it’s a correct adapter or not .
5,The Belker Universal Adapter is a quality product and great value for the price. I like that it arrived quickly and was exactly what I searched for to replace an indoor wind chime that no longer worked with the original power supply. I'm now able to enjoy my peaceful chimes without the added expense of batteries. Also great communication and follow-up from the seller. Thanks again.
4,All the adaptors you could need and easy to set up.
5,What can I say?  It is what it is.  I needed to replace an ac adapter and it did the job. I tried it in place of a couple of other ac adapters too.  The voltage was easy to select with a flathead screwdriver and the interchangeable connectors fit snugly.  I’d buy it again if I needed it.
4,It does the job. The amp indicator is hard to turn but I guess it needs to hold firm and not slide into the wrong setting.
5,I had a universal adapter years ago and have been meaning to finally get one and I did.  Already it has been so helpful.  It has several different adapter ends included that fit almost anything that's smaller allowing me to chunk all of these chargers that I have no idea what they go with. I definitely recommend purchasing one and you won't regret it.  This one is a great price and great quality.  Highly recommend!!!!
4,I really don't know yet.  For my digital camera it power it.  I have a toy that it didn't work on.
5,"Wall Warts" of various voltages are not the easiest things to find in most towns. This one has selectable voltages (up to 12vdc) and a variety of different size tips to fit all kinds of devices.  Very useful good value for the price.
5,My son's keyboard didn't come with an adapter so I bought this one. It comes with a "key" so that you can turn the dial to the desired voltage. Each of the sizes of plugs for the adapter snap on hard and stays on. Great for what I need.
4,Can not adjust polarity positive and negative .
4,shipped fast / accurately described / quality goodBad thing is if you have to reverse the polarity of the plug you can not do it.It will only charge things that have the center positive and the outside negative.
5,We LOVE our baby monitor and we’re not looking forward to getting another just because the cord didn’t work. We couldn’t find the cord through the brand of monitor itself.Found this as a perfect solution and it was easy to figure out! Totally saved tons of money!
4,not used as a charger but a power supply on my antique watch winder. will save me a fortune in batteries
5,Works great and seems to be weii made and works great.
3,Not one end fixture for phone applications. All game fixtures.Very disappointed. Tototally useless for my needs.
5,This is a very handy charger for multiple uses instead of having different chargers for different voltages this is a small and very flexible DC charger.
3,This is one of two designs from the same company.  This design is inferior to the other.  This design has “pins” that insert into the cord that are easily bent and has resulted in inconsistent contacts (loss in power).  The other design from the same company has a barrel design for the heads of the adapter which inserts into the cord.  Buy that one.
5,I didn't bother to check my device to determine the polarity and ordered this without reading the bit in the description saying that it's TIP POSITIVE only and CAN NOT BE REVERSED. The connector end is solid plastic which is great because I was able to use a dremel tool to flatten out the other side and fit the charger plug on in reverse polarity. Now it's serving admirably for its intended use but pay attention to your device and if yours needs a negative tip don't buy unless you're handy with tools to modify it.
5,Delivered quickly even during Christmas season. The UPS driver was polite. The product performed as advertised. I was amazed at how little it was but it was easy to set the voltage and hookup the correct connecters. No need now to use batteries.
1,Testing the voltages with my multimeter I started at the 3V setting and worked my way up.  The voltages weren't exact but they were close enough for what I needed - until I got to the 6V setting.  At 6V the multimeter read nearly 24V!!!!!  I unplugged the unit from the wall and it was hot to touch.I then attempted to check the remaining voltages (if just 6V was bad I could probably just not use that setting).  They didn't work at all until the unit cooled down.  The higher voltages where all ok except they were all reading a little low.  This may have been normal or it may have been a result of the 6V issue - there is no way of knowing now.  Then retesting the lower voltages I noticed the power LED was pulsating.  When checking them with the multimeter again they were now fluctuating - 3V was fluctuating between 3.4V and 4.15V.  4.5V wasn't as bad and 5V was reading pretty steady.Finally retesting the 6V it was a little over 21V again and then the power light shut off and no more voltage could be read on any setting.  It is now a brick that does nothing.
4,I bought a portable video player at a thrift store good quality but had no cord. This one fit just right to charge the battery and to play in house so battery doesn't get used up.
5,Great product. Was able to find the right adapter for my phone. It comes with an assortment if adapters.  Also you can adjust the voltage. My portable phone is 6v. My cat is obsessed with small cords and chewed the cord to my phone. I was having a hard time locating a replacement plug and found this on Amazon. I took a chance and ordered it. It worked and now I have a working phone. The price was very reasonable too.
5,Connector adapters fit tightly to both the power supply cable and a portable led light array that my artist partner lost its original power supply to.  Highly recommended.
4,so far so good.
4,It almost fit perfectly but it could be my worn out jack.  I need to fiddle with the jack to get my device to charge but  it brought my device back from the dead so I'm happy.  There are many settings and adapters so it can fit many applications.
4,Needed this to replace a lost adapter.  Worked like a charm.  Have not had a chance to use it on other devices.  But looking forward to testing.
4,Used to replace power adapter on LED lamp that failed. So far so good. Too bad only one of the connectors is needed so the rest will probably need to get tossed. Cheaper than buying new lamp or dedicated power adapter.
4,I think it would be helpful to label each adapter with what voltage it is intended for.
5,The AC DC Adapter Power Supply lends itself to great flexibility in supporting multiple devices.  I used it for an old portable radio that I have had for many years.  I have looked for the right AC/DC transformer for a number of years with no luck.  This transformer filled the bill.
5,No real complaint about the original power supply. We had the bike for almost 20 years and it was never just a clothes rack. BUT it finally died and our expensive exercise machine was useless. This Belker supply worked great and had an wide array of connectors. The original supply said it was 6 volts but turned out to be 7.5. The Belker solved this neatly with one click of the setting switch. The bike OEM wanted $50 for a replacement and the original always hummed anyway. Yea Belker!
5,My marriage was on the brink devices qere not powered. My wife threatened to take my child if I could not resolve the situation then the adapter arrived may hair grew back I lost weight and took up cycling.
5,This is a good power supply with reasonable current limits.  It will be good for many things.  The only issue I have with it is that I wish you could change polarity...  Sometimes a device needs a negative center post hopefully rarely I don't really know.
5,Exactly as described. Powered up my focusrite 6i6 second gen which needed SPECIFICIALLY 1A . Everywhere should sell these. Everyone should have one. Greedy companies try to steal and markup your replacement plugs or the times roll by and they wont cover you anymore. These guys got you. Very happy
4,Its works good for whatI needThank You
5,What a quality product!  Very well made.  Be certain to select the correct voltage for your particular appliance (you may need a magnifying glass to see it on your old transformer) as it would be possible to use any of the plugs provided with too much voltage thereby damaging your appliance.
5,Worked like a charm. Its really versatile it can change voltage with a key that is given in the box. For 10$ it's pretty good. I use it to charge my smaller electronics to test others I don't have chargers for. Was able to charge my kindle first generation like a charm.Its fairly small which is nice so It doesn't take up much space on my outlet Really good deal. Enjoyed the product.
5,I bought this for a dancing Santa and plays music.  You can choose the correct voltage  and has different  sizes  to fit.  It works perfect and I  couldn't  be happier.
5,I bought this adapter because I had bought a 13 gal Homelabs stainless steel garbage can. Apparently the manufacturer of the garbage can sold out of its adapter. I was concerned whether I could fine a adapter as I did not want to run it on c batteries.I received your product and the issue concerning the adapter was solved. THANK YOU so much. I am very pleased.
5,I've used this on several electrical objects with differing power requirements without problem.  I just hope I can find the adapters when I will need them again in the future.
5,Firstly thank you both Belker & Amazon for delivering in this hard situations. The product is great and solved my issue. It is little bit hard to choose from the pins (lot of options) but it is one time. This product gives you a lot of combinations. I recommend this product.
5,So far this works great. I lost the adapter for my electric screwdriver. I found the correct adapter head and plugged it in—charged great and it was cheaper than buying a new screwdriver. We have lots of things around the house we can use this for. The shipping was super fast.
2,I purchased two of these to power 12v LED lights for video chat for work and after about 30 days one of my lights started flashing on/off like a strobe light.The light works perfectly with the other working cord and so I tried the broken Belker cord with other 12v electronics (I double-checked the voltage setting) and the same intermittent power issue came up again. The cord was plugged in and wasn't moved for the whole month.Unfortunately this is beyond the return window. The other Belker cord/adapter I have is still working so I hope that doesn't break too I may have just gotten a dud after seeing positive reviews from others. So I gave this 2 stars since one cord is still working but who knows for how long.
5,Worked perfectly for my old keyboard. I almost returned it because I didn’t switch the settings on the plug and thought it didn’t work. Once I figured it out it worked great.
5,I had a good experience with the Belker universal cord.  I had to have a little help using the key to turn it to the correct setting for 6 volt because of my arthritis but with help I got it to the correct setting and my beautiful clock started to work.  I was ecstatic.  Thank you for making a versatile useful product!
5,Worked well for what I needed! I found I lost the AC adapter for a fiber optic Halloween decoration I've had forever! All the connection and power option were awesome since I had no idea what I really needed!
4,I wish it was a longer cord for what I’m using it for but other than that it’s great!
5,This product is awesome. I didn’t realize that you can adjust the voltage on the back of Ac wall port. I was wondering why my devices were not charging. I was actually shipped another device and the charger was faulty. No problem I had this handy. It works. Great investment
5,Pretty good cord.Helped me tremendously.
5,Bought this for my neighbor to replace a lost charger. Worked like a charm. They were unable to find a replacement charger but this did the trick. They were quite happy.
4,All good!
5,good price  fair quality and it works for me out of the box . if someone had put a positive / negative reversal switch or a way to flip the adapters at the cord end it would be an almost perfect product.
4,This is a great device. The four stars were because the polarity of the jack apears to be fixed at center + only and the voltage did not go down to 1.5 VDC. A way of attaching the many jacks to the body to prevent loss would have been a plus.
3,It looks like the plug is interchangeable but in reality once you put one of them on you're stuck with it.  I tried one plug to test on another device to see if I wanted to order a second charger.  Then I tried to swap it for the plug I needed and one of the pins broke off.  Never got to use it so that's my complete review.
5,Needed a specific adapter for my daughter's karaoke machine but was clueless as to which one. Ordered this for very inexpensive price and she was singing LOUDLY to hearts content in a matter of days. Fast delivery!
5,Works well and has sufficient tabs to charge almost anything you need charged.
3,I ordered this for a leg compressor that i lost the ac adaptor to.  Unfortunately it did not work. It came with a lot of adapters.  But i needed one that was straight.  The adapters were too short for me to use.  I will try to return the item.
5,Honestly I’ve not used the charger but I’m sure it’ll work as described. I ordered the wrong polarity and it doesn’t work with my Coleman universal quick air pump rechargeable battery. I need a 6v dc charger/adapter which it is but the polarity is incorrect. It’s taking me too much time and if I continue will cost me too much money as well so I’m stopping while I’m good. I’ll find some type of use for this one.
5,This power unit is easily switched from one voltage to another and the plug tips can also be changed to allow you to provide power to many different devices in the stated voltage and ampere ranges.  Good job Belker!
3,the voltage wasn't high enough
5,Es buen cargador yo lo use para una elliptical
5,This product was used to power lights and a fan for an airbrush paint booth. It was purchased to replace the lost original. Attached the correct plug plugged it into ac and turned on the booth power. Adjusted the voltage and it was ready to go.
5,This product worked great to power an old ethernet switch I lost the transformer for.  It had an uncommon voltage input (7.5V) that most electronics don't use today.  This transformer had the right combination of plug voltage setting and current capability I needed.
5,if you ever come up missing a an AC power supply this kit will replace it no more spinning big money on power supplies at batteries plus this kit will power anything It fits just about everything that's made great value
4,It is not a truly universal ac/dc power supply. IT HAS FIXED POLARITY.That is not established in the advertising unless you look carefully to all the images. No wonder why!I wrote to them with this complain and no answer. Better check first your device needs!
5,Works very well for my blood pressure monitor. I had no problem with adjusting the voltage out put with the key provided . I guess the design or flaw  that reviewers complained about has been fixed.
3,A great concept but with a huge flaw. There’s no way to reverse the polarity of the adapter. I purchased 2 of these power supplies and in both cases where I needed them the polarity was opposite than what these allow for. I kept them assuming that one day I’ll stumble across something that has its polarity set this way but so far it’s not looking good.
4,So far the device works fine everything I needed was there and setup was simple.
5,Everything was great
5,Great product
5,This item it’s exactly as it supposed to.  However just because you can turn up the charging power on this item doesn’t mean you should. I was impatient and I decided to turn up the item and I burnt out a battery and almost started a fire
4,This is serving it's purpose. I used this adapter to replace a broken power adapter for my Polycom Soundstation 2W (receiving base - not speakerphone itself) and it's working great. The little adapter pieces are a bit hokey if you changed them often I could see the little ports getting wore out and them not fitting snugly but in my case I wont be changing them.
4,The charger will work on a variety of items. We are pleased that it will work in place of a lost charger for a cleaning tool that is used frequently.  Item was as expected but will also work on my tablet. A nice surprise.
5,I needed a replacement adapter for my cordless headset charger for work. I didn't know what size to get so I ordered this since it has so many sizes.Found the correct size plugged it in and good to go. Works perfectly.
5,The product was delivered promptly and is working great.  It replaced a power supply to a HDMI extender.  It’s working perfectly so far so good.
5,I misplaced the original connectors for my weather station.  This fits is easy to set up and works like a charm.  It's only been used for one device but looks like it could be used for many.  Can't say I've tested its versatility.
5,This little gadget is being used to power a portable car camera monitor after the USB port broke.  It's small and lightweight included the tips it described and happily the tip I needed was in the pack.  The item works very well.
4,Great product. Only wish it came with a longer cord.
5,It was easy to set up. I had saved our previous adapter power supply that our cat had chewed through the wiring so it was easy to choose from the different plug options. It was a lot less expensive than replacing the entire indoor camera and wiring.
1,It very difficult to make it work
5,bought one for my kids noise machine. Worked flawlessly. Ended up buying a second as a power supply for an external monitor for my video equipment. I love that I can change voltages. Super versatile. Would buy again if I needed another power supply!
5,It works great. Arrived in a timely manner and provides the power that our device requires.
5,We had a sound machine for my kids that we take everywhere. We have two and broke/lost the power cords. It wasn’t a big deal since we can also power it with batteries. Well now we have a baby and had it on all the time so we were using a ton of batteries. We got this as a replacement plug and it’s been working wonderfully!!!
5,With all of the various tips provided and voltage choices I'd rate the versatility high. Even comes with a small tool to change the voltage setting. I consider the price very good for what I received. As I've only had this for a few days and powered the portable amp device only one time it is too early to provide any rating on durability.
5,I used this to replace the AC adapter for a J-Tech HDMI converter/switch (which had required replacement once before). This unit seems well-built. There's a solid selector switch to set the output voltage and an assortment of tips. Restored my J-Tech unit to operation immediately.
4,Not bad I got it to replace my echo dot cord it fits but it's not the same sometimes I have to unplug it because it makes it hot 🤷🏿‍♀️
5,I bought this product as a replacement for my desk calculator.  The one it came with wore out and I've been using batteries in it for a long time.  I'm tired of buying batteries!  This item works great thank you.
5,I needed to adapt a battery device to direct power.  This did it perfectly.  I needed to modify the plug heavily to accomplish my task but if you just need a plug in 12 v PS this will probably work for you.  It is adjustable and it includes a million and 1 tips for everything imaginable including round plugs and usb.
5,The key to change it  to any voltage should be sold attach to the charger so we do lose it. N also should include C port. Most Other then that it is a great peace to have. It works great.
5,read the instructions.
5,Was hesitant about getting it at first but SO HAPPY that I did! Super useful and handy !!
5,Works very well. Delivered quickly. Perfect for a variety of uses.
5,This is an awesome plug. Worked great for what I needed and saved me money on buying multiple plugs. Highly recommend.
5,I'm using this to power a portable white noise machine that previously required 3 AA batteries. Using the 4.5 volt setting it now works perfectly with this. It comes with a truly amazing number of plugs so it probably will work with almost any device. Finally the price is dirt cheap. I love it!
5,I have a statue that I somehow misplaced the original plug for. This one is variable and has a lot of attachments and will fit many different types.  Though I bought it for one statue I have found that it works with a lot of other items around the house some of which need batteries this is a good replacement.
4,Great product great delivery time and very pleased.
5,I was very pleased with this charger however it would not work with my computer as I was hoping. The ends were easy to change and there wereany different kinds of charger ends included I was sad none fit for mine.
5,This universal adapter is perfect for what I needed. Multi plugs for most of my electronics that are missing the A/C adapter. Simple to use as long as you know the input volts of the device.
1,Am I missing a something simple?  The adaptor plugs do not connect to the adaptor chord.  The plugs are all rounded with 2 prongs inside.  The chord into which they should connect has ports for the 2 prongs and should easily slide into the plugs however the grey part with the ports is 3/4 rounds with a 1/4 flat edge.  This DOES NOT slide into any of the adaptor plugs.I am surprised no one has written a review about this (at least not that I found) so I feel as though I am missing a step in the connection process.  Regardless I am returning the item for as far as I can figure out it is unusable as is.
5,Had dozens of adapters around the house from various electronic gadgets none of them worked naturally they are all gone and the camcorder works perfectly. The combinations of voltage and different connectors are exactly what is needed around the house.
5,my husband was without a cord for years for his radio that he takes to work it used to take 8D batteries which were expensive now he can just plug it in with our new universal outlet cord..it works great
3,It works ok in a pinch
5,Product arrived as advertised; very versatile plug.
5,It works and we are happy. The various size fittings are very helpful. Feel confident in ordering this item if that is what you are looking for with your electronics.
5,It comes with different adapters  Works good with my portable desk light. Good Value for the money.
4,This works well for most things but I noticed that the amperage is not sufficient when trying to charge my label make. 12v 2amp... this was disappointing but it works for the other electronics I need it for
5,many different plugs for the right project put to use on my ceramic villages  Christmas tree displays
4,It didn't work for my device.
5,My daughter lost the power supply for her desk lamp. I bought two other adapters prior to this one thinking I had ordered the correct one each time; but they did not fit properly. Finally found this universal adapter for about the same price as the other two and it finally fit and worked perfectly!!
5,Awesome! I couldn't find the right size adapter I needed for a memorable item I bought over 10 yrs ago! This came on time with a lot of other sizes that may come in handy later. Great product!
5,So far so good.. works as described
5,Well my dad had an walkietalkie from motorola and losted his original power adapter it was a 9V with a diferent plug on it. And I looked for one that would fit lake a crazy and this one was my pot of gold in the end of the rainbow. It is an excelente product and a great value for money. Recommend.
5,I got these because I wanted to wire some battery powered candles to them (to stop buying batteries) and the voltage was specifically 4.5 volts. When they arrived (I bought 2) I tested the adapters and the output voltages at each setting to ensure it worked properly which it does! Everything is sturdy/stiff and made very well.
4,make sure to use a screwdriver or some other lever to switch voltage
5,This product works well for me.  I am using it to replace a lost power source for a digital picture frame.  I have read that some consumers said that the product melted upon using but remember that the product is rated for no more than a 12V output and any device beyond that would probably create heat in the product.
4,Perfect for my curio LED.  9 volt adaptor was too bright i used the 6volt output and its perfect.
5,I lost my adapter and was sick and had no idea the sold one for all things so now I will not have to buy a other on as I have all adapters
4,Just as described....worked for our needs... fast shipping
5,I love this product!  I lost a plug in for my portable DVD player and wasn’t able to use it.  This had the perfect fitting plug and so much more!  Now I won’t need to panic if I misplace another one!
5,I had a hard time finding an adapter at all let alone one for my elliptical  this thing is universal so the connections on the end of the power cord matched and fit! Happy me!
5,My wife has Christmas village piece that she purchased at Kohl’s as a display model. It was a great deal until she realized the power cord was missing. Thankfully this one fit and my wife was very happy.
5,Perfect for my battery operated scanner that I can now plug in and keep on 24/7.
5,Es una excelente inversión ese cargador universal.es una transparencia total y versatilidad.se los recomiendo es muy importante y buena calidad.
5,I've been very happy with the versatility and quality of this adapter. I purchased it to power a small 5v device but couldn't tell exactly which size male fitting I needed. This set included one that did the job! It's also great to have the variety in case I need a different size/voltage adapter down the way.
5,Have not used the merchandise yet but it appears that all the parts are there.
5,This is quite the cool product.  You pick the right size charging fixture and the with a key you can change the voltage of the plug.  Very cool and saves you from buying multible charging devices.  Just make sure you have it on the proper voltage and walla!
4,No issues with the product. However the adaptors are very large. If you have a recessed plug these may not fit. Used for aquarium lights and had to trim the plastic to get the plug snug.
5,Have a few mini cd players (and lots of cd's) that didn't have a.c. adapters and this fits the bill! Found a plug size for even one of the more obscure sizes. Recommended!
5,This model has all the tips you would need to get nearly anything powered. Works well and the adjustable voltage is a nice feature if your are using it for multiple items.
5,Arrived a day earlier then expected and did what it had to do...thank you so much. The various piece tips and the little tool to set the voltage is fantastic.  Very pleased consumer.
5,Lifesaver. Broke the charger to my baby girls' monitor and this fits perfectly. Actually works better than the one that came with their monitor.
5,I am  always losing  or misplacing  my power supplies.  So this is a great product to use in a pinch .
3,I've only had the device a few days.  That's why I gave an overall rating of three stars.  It hasn't been in use that long.  Setup was easy dkevice looks like it will be successful in the long run.
5,I read the displeasure of some people. As I read between the lines it seemed that most people were improperly matching your product with a device that was NOT correct for the Belker 12 watt rating and amperage draw. I double checked my old converter input and output. Your unit worked like a charm and I am satisfied.
5,Plethora of connectors. Perfectly fit the sound machine that I broke the power supply for. It's worked like a charm. Recommend!
5,Received this about a week ago to have as a secondary charger for a baby monitor and it has down it's job.  It works just as well as the one that came from the factory.
5,I have a boombox and the supplied power supply was cheap and would not maintain a good contact at the connector. This supply has a nice tight connection that works well.  It is easy to select the voltage and the connectors are of good quality.  I ended up buying a couple for different devices around the house.
5,This is great when you need a power supply and you aren't sure what adapter. This allows you to use it on multiple devices and it is super easy to use. I would reccommend it.
4,no comment
5,I had lost the original power supply for a device.  This one had the correct voltage and at least enough current.  Two of the multiple adapters fit my device and they both work.
5,I am using this product for my little ottlite that didn’t come with a power cord. It will be very useful for more of my gadgets I am sure. I’m a bit disappointed there was no stop to hold the different plugs but it gives me something to create to fit my needs.
5,as long as you put on the right pin and select the right voltage this baby works.
5,Easy head change the heads aren't loose. The volt switch is tactile and clicks into it's settings so no chance of volt change without the key/a screw driver. Just what I needed for all those lost adapters.
4,I use this adapter to power a Fisher Price crib and it does its job my only problem with it is that it makes a chirping noise like there were crickets inside. It can be quite annoying.
5,This is great little power supply with numerous types of adapters with various voltage (dc ) sizes outlets.  I have been able to get some old appliances radio's scanners etc. working after the original power supplies were lost or quit working.
5,I was looking for a plug-in power source for various electronics projects (arduino breadboard etc.) and this fit the bill perfectly with its adjustable voltage and many plug options. Works great so far with no complaints.
5,Just what i needed i had one years ago but this one is so much better. So glad i ordered.Thank you for making such a great product. Highly recommend !!!
5,It took 10 seconds to find the right adapter set the voltage and start the recharge on an old device that I found at a flea market :-)
5,I have an old SportsCraft Electronic Dartboard that uses 3 AA Batteries. With this Adapter I was able to dial in the 4.5 volts needed and it worked like a champ. I can use my dartboard again without having to change batteries.
5,I bought this for my wife for an appliance shes had a while. The normal power adapter gave out and this was the best replacement i could find. Just wish it came with a way to store the extra attachments.
4,Very handy to have.
5,I bought this to power a number of battery powered devices but specifically I bought it to power an electronic dartboard.It works without batteries now.  Love it!
5,Replacement for burned out adapter. Good.
5,Llegó  bien y funciona bien. Gracias
4,Product work and help solve the issue with my wireless mic.I had to replace my power source for my AKG wms 40 receiver.It made my mic work again. thanks to this adapter didn't have to replace the whole unit.Satisfied with product.
5,I bought this for a rechargeable flashlight. One of the tips was a perfect fit and with the adjustable voltage it did the job perfectly.
3,I ordered 2. One works perfectly but the other has a kink in the cord right out of the box. But it happens I will probably rerun it and order another one from the same company.
2,I did not like that there is a power light but no full charge notification. It would be nice if the light went from orange to green or something to let you know the charge is complete.
5,Excellent Item I will buy it again!
5,Lost an ac adapter for a valuable item and was pleased to be able to adjust this for the specific requirement for the plug in and the electrical input to it.  Very cheep solution to a headache!
5,Wasn’t sure about size and this came with array of sizes to choose from.  Thankfully it fit. Was very pleased it was  “Value for the money.”
5,I received the charger and was pleasantly surprised that it was actually better quality that I had expected. I have only had the charger for about 2 weeks but so far it is working well. I love the fact that it is adjustable to the output voltage that I need. Shipping was fast also.
5,Arrive quickly and works well. I love that it has so many hook up options for the same price as a single charger.
5,This has tons of awesome features like all the different options of plugs variable voltages.  And it's not set up in one of those awkward star thingies. Very nice product.
5,Mainly bought the item as an AC Power Supply for my Sony Walkman model 403 and it has worked great! Just what I needed to get it to play right.
5,I lost the charger for my Roll With It massage ball. This charger is cheap versatile and has worked well for me.
4,Bought this product a long time ago and like this newer design.  Only drawback is a shorter cord so I have to use an extension cord with it.
5,What I liked about it  is that I can use it for more than one thing. It is easy to use and it is portable.
4,na
3,Works very well and easy to set up however after having 2 of these one of which for a few months they emit a rather noticeable high pitched whine that becomes very aggravating.
5,Multiple options to make sure it works for most needs.
4,Received promptly and works as advertised.  No problems at this time but haven't had very long.  It is working well.
5,Awesome little unit! Easy to change to voltage needed. Quality looks top notch.
5,Very good product works great exactly what I was looking for.
5,Ease of using various tips for different uses.
5,Worked well for what we needed as we lost our charger for our flashlight.
5,Works for the light I bought that didn't come with a cable. Knew with the different heads that one would work. Shipping on time.
5,Works great used it as a replacement for my tablet
3,product seems to work as indicated -- time will tell. but it is very poorly constructed - the variable voltage control cannot possible be turned with the lilliputian "screwdriver a regular screwdriver worked with moderate torque effort; fitting the variable heads into the common cable was also difficult because of poor workmanship. all below tioy quality.
4,Was a little disappointed it didn't have the attachment for my fatmaxx light. Only reason I bought it.
5,Works flawlessly so far (a few days in) has plenty of attachment options and conviently comes with a key to turn to the proper voltage.
5,Works with philips advent dect baby monitor  Only had it for a week but you set it for 6V find the right tip and that’s it.
5,Nice product very versatile.
5,Exactly what I needed !!! Love it
4,Good
5,I am using it on my Wifi AP and it was very easy to set just change the voltage selector thats pretty much it!
5,This product was receivedvery quickly after I ordered it. I was putting a Halloween display and found I did not have enough power plugs. I really like the product. There are so many possibilities I can use this product for and it came with so many adapters. I would definitely order this product again.
5,I use this AC adapter to power a small string of decorative LED lights by splicing the AC adapter in line and taking out the 3AA batteries.  Works great.  I use it on the 3 volt setting so the lights won't be so bright.
5,I needed an AC adapter for a unique digital clock that only came with a USB connector!  I received this product in two days!  And with the multiple size adapters provides me with quite a range of applications.  Thank you!!
5,Great device. Unfortunately didn't have a connector that fits what I originally bought it for but I quickly found another use for it!
5,did what I needed was delivered well and all in excellent condition  thank you as it was exactly what I needed
5,I love the diversity of the adapters and the quality in prime thank you guys so much for a quick delivery too! Highly recommend!
5,Used this for my baby monitor. Cost a fraction of the price of the brand-name replacement and is more sturdy to boot.
4,Its does the job
5,The product works just as advertised. My only issue is that the key used to change output voltage is small and hard to turn if your grip strength is impaired. Nevertheless there are many screwdrivers that will fit and work perfectly with minimal effort.
5,works great
5,Exactly what I was looking for. I have a remote control car I wasn't sure what piece or what voltage so this was perfect.
5,I needed to replace the power supply for my photo viewing frame and this universal power supply cost the same or less than a single voltage supply.  It is well made and works perfectly for my needs. Shipping was overnight as usual with Prime.
5,This adapter does exactly what it's supposed to do. With eight plugs I found one that fit my portable radio. I also like that it's compact and not heavy since I plan to take my radio and adapter with me on trips. And it was very reasonably priced. I have no negative comments.
5,The user of the pedometer is the only one aware of the information that is recorded.  The information is not sent on to the manufacturer.  It works well and protects your privacy.
5,Works really good.I need a plug for a light portable dvd player and a digital camera. Worth the money and it easy to use. Better than buying separate plugs for multiple accessories.
5,It was delivered early and it was easy to use. I loved that you could change the voltage use so I can use it on other products.We are very pleased!
5,Used this for my router.  Works perfectly.
1,I have a radio that I want to power by A.C. not batteries. Went to Amazon placed order assembled unit when it arrived.1. The adapter plug while servesable doesn't fit well.2. Because of that the charger loses contact with the radio unless you take the time to play around with the plug.3. I bought the unit with the idea of using it as a backup power supply while recharging the batteries. No go... the power supply doesn't work without batteries in the radio put rechargeable batteries in and powered up the radio AFTER SCREWING WITH THE POWER JACK thinking that the power supply would power the radio and recharge the batteries. Nope the batteries ran out of oomph and the radio died.Based on my experience with the charger I gave it one star mostly because the indicator in the wall power unit with appropriate finagle effort does light up.
5,Just what I needed. Very versatile accessory for charging toys tools or any other piece of equipment within the voltage limits.
2,The first two devices I tried to use with this power supply didn't work.  The first was simply that none of the adapters work with a Skil Ixo drill.  Not a single one matched that style of connector.  The second device was a Brother label maker that has a common connector but the device simply would not work with this power adapter.  I double-checked that I had the correct input voltage and correct adapter size but nothing worked.  So far the only device this has worked successfully on for me was a cellphone using the USB connector.  Very disappointing product for me.
5,Works great
5,100% sacrifice
5,This adapter is fantastic! It works exactly as they said it would. I love how multi functional it is. I’ll probably be ordering more in the future. Great product
4,GoodG
5,Very easy to use and versatile for many charging applications. Very pleased with this purchase.
5,Exactly what I needed
4,A little on the cheap side but for the price I did not expect much.  Works for what I needed it for and it should hold up fairly well.
5,Works for most of my devices. Awesome
5,I used for an old tablet in which the charging cord developed a short.  works great
5,Decided to convert a battery operated light to plug in found out I needed a 4.5v transformer this one had that voltage as one of its' settings and it has worked perfectly for my needs.
5,I purchased this product for my neighbor. She found a light up sign that she liked that didn't have an adapter. So she was ecstatic when we tried this one and it worked!
5,The adapter works perfectly and I will be able to use it with other items as well. I don't need to waste batteries.
5,Replacement for radio scanner power supply.  Operates as expected and am happy with my choice.  Provides 23 hour service.
5,You get what you order at a great price.  No need for old heavy transformers.
5,Just what I needed.
5,We are now able to plug in and not waste alot of batteries on different toys that my daughter's have and some of our devices too!
5,This adaptor is very versatile and useful. The tips can be changed easily. I use this for baby sound machine all night long every night and its been going strong for a while now. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a power adaptor.
5,Have used several of these power supplies (AC adapters) and is an easy way to power the models I am working on.  Price is right and quality is OK.  Postage and handling is too high.
5,This worked perfectly for my lost power supply for my DBPOWER portable DVD player.
5,Buen producto justo lo que necesitaba
5,I lost a charger for my sons toy and while I could have bought that exact charger for about $4 more I bought this charger which has multiple adapters and multiple voltage settings to basically charge anything you own at home. This product is genius
1,Bought this power supply for an accessory monitor.  It somehow manages to create a 60 cycle hum all the way back through the camera's  recording system. It's a prosumer camera so it's got some cheap junk camera. Camera. My bet is that this cheap junk power supply is the problem and I'd really like to send it back...  It would be better if it actually worked but if that can't happen then I want to send it back
5,Ideal versatile charger that will work for the intended job as well as any others that may come up.
4,liked the extra plugins
5,I had a hard time finding a ac to dc plug for my home water tank. I chanced it and bought this plug and it has been wonderful!
5,Nice product. Did the trick.
3,Purchased to charge my Ryobi 4.5 volt screwdriver and this charger DOES NOT WORK!!!!
5,What I like about this item is that I can use one plug for multiple things. I love it.
5,This product was what I was needing. We purchased a riding toy for my toddler son and we need a nice universal charger to replace the one that broke. The charger worked well and charged the item quickly.
5,Got this for kids project works and is very easy to use when you need different voltage for different setups
5,it had the connector i needed and works fine for about 3 weeks now.
3,The quality wasn't as good as I was expecting. It works but it's a pain in the ass to change the heads.
5,Very easy just need to know what the bolts are and adjust the back switch. Love this unit I bought 3 of them they all work fantastically.
5,love this product...good price .sturdywell made
5,Nice product well made.  These are not real easy to find anymore and this model is a very top of the line!
5,I'm using this as an additional plug-in for my remote speaker on the TV.  Works perfectly.
5,Wow great adapter. Came just when i needed it to play my keyboard. Thank you. It arrived so quickly
5,Exactly as advertised and works great!!
5,Great product! I bought this for a small record player and it worked great.
5,With all the different adapter heads and a key to control the voltage this is really convenient. I've been powering a cassette player with it for a while now and it's still going strong.
5,Very easy to use. It was a perfect replacement for baby monitor cord and other things!
5,Perfect! This saved me the trouble of buying and returning a bunch of what-I-think-is-the-correct-size plugs.
5,I like it very much I use it on my camera keyboard charge my phoneexc. Works great..
5,Well made carefully designed and very useful. The adapter is versatile and has multiple applications.
4,Product came quickly and as expected
3,of all the adapters  only one met my needs by bad will never buy from again
5,Have not used yet but it arrived as advertised
3,Does not give out enough power
5,I bought this for my CD player.  Got tired of replacing batteries.  I made  sure the polarity was correct for this adapter and it came with lots of fittings to make sure it would work.
5,Seems to work great so far! Just too bad the thing I bought it for didn't work after charged. Easy to switch between heads and output. I'll definitely find another use or three!
5,It worked perfectly for my Christmas Clock.
5,I have not used it long enough to comment on the durability but it performed exactly as I needed it to. I use it for my six deck card shuffler to keep from using batteries.
5,Bought it for my grandson who lost the adapter for his keyboard. It worked fine.
5,great quality product at a reasonable price
5,Great value here.. works very well with all tips..
5,Worked great saved me from buying a new device. Thanks I would buy again if I need one.
5,exactly what I need and easy to use long cord that is very useful
5,I used it for my charging my head light for work and also used it for various phones and tablets.
5,Easy to use and set up; however it would be helpful if the plug were labeled showing their size.
5,I ordered this item hoping one of the several adapters would fit the monitor I needed it for. It did not!! I couldn’t give it a bad review though because it came as advertised!
5,Exactly what I was looking for.
3,I  had to hold the connection in a certain spot to make a connection. While it was working it made a lot of noise and I couldn't hear what was being said through the head set.
5,Works as stated...
4,Good quality does the job affordably priced
5,So convenient to set up and put to use for CD player.
5,So I used this because I needed another one for my ring light. This one worked PERFECT! The cord is a little shorter than my previous one but it does work! Good deal
5,multiple plugs and power choices were just the thing.
4,Exactly as described. Happy with Purchase
5,WE had misplaced one important charger (I usually label each charger so I know what it goes to) and the manufacturer of my rechargeable flashlight wanted WAY too much for a replacement so this was absolutely ideal.
5,This was a replacement for a Teeter pierre supply and has worked perfectly.
5,This adaptable charger gives different options to plug it so it is multi-use if you lost a cord.  There is a little key to switch the voltage needed.
5,ease of use  lights up my JESUS crusafix it's great thank you better then the battery option
5,Now have all these extra adapter pieces & not sure what will be done with them
5,Serves exactly the purpose intended and comes with everything needed  seven tips and tool to adjust voltage ! I was very pleased . I was replacing a cord on my antenna and this worked out great !
5,Most of the times you order something thinking it is what you want but get something different.  I got what I ordered an it works like I expected.  Also a great price.
5,The device feels well built. The tips fit tightly and there are plenty of tip options.
5,Just what I was looking for and needed.  No more batteries.The other adapters work on other items I have that I cannow use the adapter rather than batteries.
5,This item works wonderfully! . I tested with all my small electronic appliances and it works like a Champ. Now and Do Not need to keep so many electronic charges laying around the house. I just use my new Universal charger. Good Purchase!
5,ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS READ BEFORE USE. DIDN'T UNDERSTAND DIFFERENT POWER USED IF IT FIT'S  SO I BURNED WHAT I WAS TO CHARGE UP. SMOKE CAME OUT OF WHAT I WAS CHARGING  READ FIRST
1,after frying multiple electronics including an external TB hard drive I have decided to return this item.
5,It has every adapter I will ever need easy to use.
3,So weak that it will not blow up anything. I should have read more about it. I like the different attachments
5,Does what it's supposed to
5,I used this to replace my router cord that I lost. Initially thought it didn't work but then I saw I needed to use the key to change the voltage. Seems sturdy works great!
5,Works well
5,So when I bought this the only thing I worried about was the ends falling off and being lost. Not the case. They click tightly in place and all fit their matching receptacle as well.
2,I bought this item in May 2017. It was quite nifty what with variable voltage outputs and all sorts of different plugs. Worked well too. For a while. Somewhere between 10 and 12 hours of use it died. I happened to be watching the red light on the side when it went out. Very sad to see your nifty ac adapter die right in front of you. And so young too.It is said to be a Belker product. The name on the unit I received was Westronix not Belker. Westronix. Made in China.
5,Needed for my 10 year old hard drive. Worked great
5,It does what it’s supposed to do...  I purchased 2 in the last couple years and love them!  Super handy!
3,Appears versatile. Did not help solve our exercise bike computer problem. We tried all voltage settings starting at the lowest setting and the console still did not work. Thought the unit would be bigger.
5,I used the lights for outside and they work great.  Excellent product for the money.
5,Great product solid construction. Great for use with multiple devices
5,This adapter came with a wide selection of options. From changing the voltage to changing the adapter heads this ac adapter works great! Highly recommended!
3,I am not sure because after hooking it up I found that this wasn't the problem.
5,Needed a replacement for a 4.5v 200mA DC adapter and the manufacturer of the item I needed it for did not sell replacements.  This item supports a range of voltages and an assortment of connectors is provided.  1 of the connectors was a perfect fit.
5,I have a variety of Department 56 houses and accessories. This set of adaptors and voltages work for all mine. I plan to buy another one. Time will tell on durability.
4,just what I was looking for. needed a charger for some ac required products that didn't come with them.
5,Works great for what i need it for.
5,I used this for a cordless phone. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
5,Excellent Multi-Output Voltage Power Supply for small home electronics. Great Value. Recommended Item.
5,Great replacement power supply. Many different attachments so it'll work with almost anything!
4,Works as should so far
5,Adaptable feature for so many of my small appliances that also work with batteries. Save the batteries for the power failures and use this on so many items.
5,This works great. Be sure to use a regular flat head screwdriver before using the tool key. It will likely bend because it's pretty tight at first.
5,I love the various options for this product.
5,product works with my light charging was great
5,Worked perfectly for a tablet that had a worn out cord.
5,For $11.90  so many things work well simply plug and enjoy  instead of batteries draining your wallet/purse and polluting the environment. Good job Belker and Amazon to supply a product so good and inexpensive
5,Great product.  The connection is sturdy and seemed to charge my battery with no issues.
5,Only tried it on one device but it worked fine
5,I got it for my Hybrid Trainer easy to use and very helpful
5,I can charge any small device. I used it on my Bluetooth wireless transmitter and it worked in no time.
4,Love it
5,Product as described. It worked for a replacement on a router that came with an adapter that didn't fit (supposed to be new) we ordered the router from a different seller. Arrived on time...no complaints
5,I use this in conjunction with the Lenink battery eliminator to power my trash can lid.
3,Bought this to use on our touch2o delta faucet. Even with all those attachments. None worked.
5,The unit worked perfectly on my hand held pruner. It is a variable unit that can be used for many electronic items. I would recommend it for purchase.
5,Perfect fit for C Crane WiFi Radio. No need to pay $20 for a replacement AC adapter. This one works great! Very pleased. A+
5,We bought this for a Halloween decoration we bought from the Bradford Exchange because it's battery life was poor. The Belkin power adapter was a good solution. Very happy with the purchase.
5,Very great qualityeasy to connectuseworks great!

3,this device was the incorrect power supply for the singer sewquick
5,Work great for my phone booster
5,Good solid device.  Arrived on schedule.  Works fine.
5,It works great for me and well built just one problem the cable is a little too short
2,I bought this thing and it worked fine just as advertised for about a month. Then without warning it just stopped working completely. I've tested and confirmed it's the adapter that's broken not the outlet or device. It wasn't even frequent use I used it for a hair-removal device a handful of times probably less than 10 total times.Basically it would be a nice product if it hadn't crapped out after a month - conveniently right after the return window closed.
5,Belker seems to have a great no-nonsense approach. Delivered exactly what I ordered worked well and they followed-up to ensure satisfaction. Good job!!
5,We used this adaptor for a PS3 controller charging station and it works perfectly!  Don't forget to change the voltage setting on the back for your particular device.
3,There were many sizes to choose from but didn't work for the item I had.
5,The product I purchased is for an alarm clock. It is for my grandson. I won't know much about about it until opens his present. I can write review then.
5,This power supply covers all the common voltages and plug types.  I bought it to power a driveway alarm receiver; way better than replacing batteries all the time.
5,I purchased the power supply for my phone caller I.d. and I am completely satisfied with the performance and how fast I got it.
5,I keep this as a back up and it is very handy. We lost the adapter to our baby monitor and this adapter saved us having to buy another monitor!
5,Fast shipment. Good description. Works fine.
4,Always handy to have around. (Don't lose the damned tips!)
5,Bought it to replace a  missing cord and it works awesome!
3,Didn’t work for the voltage selected but that couldn’t been the rechargeable mini drill I tried it on and not this charger.  Returned it.
5,I have tried it for a blood pressure monitor and HP laptop computer.  Both work flawlessly.  It is an excellent price for an excellent product.
5,I bought this to charge my sons ride on. Works great!
5,Needed a specific A/C adapter. This kit offers options. So if you don’t know exactly which adapter Head you need this is great.

2,This is a very small and complicated adapter.  The instructions are on a card-size folder the font was so small I needed a magnifying glass to read it. Reading was further complicated because the type was a pale gray.  I never figured it out. I tried to get more information but the seller was not helpful.

5,Altho still new it appears to work as discussed in the ad.  Happy with it so far.
5,I use them for scales in my bakery. They are sturdy for the price. I would recommend this to everyone.
1,Bought this product to plug into a battery-powered lighted makeup mirror that accepted a 6V DC power supply.  Mirror worked fine on 4 AA batteries (4*1.5 = 6V) and worked fine on another 6V power supply.  Set this supply at 6V and found the correct adapter.  Checked output voltage with voltmeter (said 6.2 V close enough).  Plugged it into makeup mirror and 5 min later mirror light blinked erratically and blew.  I went to unplug the adapter and it gave a shock.  Suggest you look elsewhere for a DC power supply.  Do Not Buy this one.
5,The fact that I can use it on numerous electronics is great
5,Works great I am very happy with the adaptor.  Easy to select proper voltage and works great as an extra power supply for my tablet.

5,Used it to charge an old power tool whose charger had died.  Worked fine.
5,Worked perfectly!
1,Unlike other universal AC adapters I've owned in the past this one ONLY has inner positive outer negative polarity.  It cannot switch to the other polarity.  So if you are looking for an adapter for a musical or audio device this probably will NOT work for you.

5,Great selection of connectors for varied devices.  Good value.
5,Worked for all the things i needed
5,Product was delivered on time and as advertised
5,Purchased for a dual cross trainer bought at a garage sale.
5,... and that’s A good thing.  No issues.
5,I like the product
1,The power supply fried my dc pump. Voltage and amp output was set correctly ran for 30 seconds and then wouldn’t run anymore.  I wouldn’t use this for anything that you don’t want fried.
1,I bought these charger connectors because I had lost one or two of my original ones and I needed to find a good set of different sized plugs for different devices. NONE of the inserts fit or worked...at all. To say that I was disappointed is true. When I saw them on Amazon the ratings were good but my evperience wasn't...at all. I found them to be completely useless.
5,Works great...I can even use it to charge my phone if needed with the micro USB attachment
2,All those adapter ends and not one of them fit the 3 devices i needed an adapter for. The one that came closest rattled around in the input hole all loosey goosey.I wish you better luck than we had with this adapter.
5,Great adapters and no issues. Great functionally would definitely recommend for the multiple options.
1,First one I bought didn’t even turn on. Returned it got a second one which immediate made my hard drive smoke and die. Don’t buy it.
1,Got this product to power a portable GE AM/FM radio I had and the only thing it did when I plugged it in is...set the radio ON FIRE! Seriously! After contacting Amazon about it they issued me an immediate full refund. But I'm still out a radio and I'm going to have to spend MORE money than I intended just to get what I already had! IMO Westronix owes me A NEW RADIO! If it wasn't for their pathetic excuse for a so-called universal plug I'd still have a radio. What a hunk of junk!
5,Cool
5,Works great with a air compressor battery charger.
5,It's a little bulky but it gets the job done
5,Great Price Fantastic Quality Fast Shipping.
5,Can go from 3-12 and everything inbetween. its pretty nice
5,I like the voltage selections and amp feature.
1,I purchaed the device to power a sensitive radio receiver that specifically needed a 6V supply. While the device did deliver 6v on the 6v setting it quickly overheated and started to generate electromagnetic noise that was incompatible with the receiver. It was completely useless for my application. Given that the device overheated I think that even for less demanding applications this is not an acceptable power supply.
1,I have purchased two of these and both failed within a few months of install. I tries contacting the company but they do not respond.. Don't purchase!!
5,Works as advertised...
5,Works great
5,The unit works fine produces the correct voltage output as described in the product description.  It was delivered on time as well.
5,I used it for my Perform workout machine.

1,Had this hooked up to a fiber optic tree for 1 week and this transformer died.  I would NOT recommend this produt to anyone.  It wasn't cheap for as cheaply as it was apparently manufactured.  Buy something (anything) else if you need more than a few weeks durability

5,Very flexible
5,Fits hard to find connections
5,Great product

1,Was looking for a power supply for Logitech Flight Yoke. None of the plug plug adapters in this kit we’re correct size even though it was listed under the search results on Amazon. Returning product and ordering a different product.
1,I ordered what the instructions for my new portable CD player I purchased through Amazon said I needed the not use batteries all the time but non of the connectors on this product worked. Also I didn’t realize I had to order this separately or I wouldn’t have purchased the CD player.
5,motion detecting? what?
5,Works on almost everything.
2,Product did not work:(
5,Perfect. Love the attachments and flexibility with the current adjuster. Excellent!
5,Worked great.
1,I was really excited about this. I bought it for an adapter for my girlfriend record player.  Used it twice before it died. No more power on light. Even tried it in multiple outlets and nothing.  It's a fancy piece of crap.
5,Es excelente
5,Very Helpful product
5,Worked great! Easy to set up!
1,Bought to replace a 9v plug.  Made sure to turn it to 9v before plugging it in. We immediately smelled burning and it was smoking! Fried my device!
5,Works like a charm!
5,Works perfectly with what I intended to use it for.
5,Great versatile product!
5,Exelente
1,Can’t give any stars as I can’t use it. Got this for a 12V router and none of the attachments fit. (Okay I can’t submit without stars so I have to go low even though I have no opinion)
5,Great product and very good price!
5,Great
1,I purchased it to connect a radio to and electrical outlet as the radio I purchased (from you) didn't have an electrical cord. it had a bunch of adaptors and none of them worked. It was a total waste of my money0
5,Satisfecho con el producto
1,Set this to the correct voltage plugged the baby monitor in cam eback in the morning and it was melted and wrapped and the plug was blazing hot. I’m lucky my house didn’t catch on fire. What a piece of garbage and dangerous! Do not buy this.
5,Replacement items
5,works fine for what my bought these to use on.
5,The assortment of plugs was right on
5,Good product.
1,It does supply output voltage as indiated. However there is no "oomph" behind it. I tried recharging a palm-sized 3.7V cordless crewdriver with this and even overnight it did not charge the unit. Using a multimeter I verified that there was the proper voltage at the terminals.
5,Works
5,Just what i needed
5,As advertised.
5,It was just what we needed. We are very satisfied

5,Portable fan
1,Didn’t need it.
5,Good for many connections
1,I’m using this for my Comcast box I set it to the appropriate setting and the box plugged in the wall over heats so badly it shuts off my cable box every 5 min. Set to exact power settings.  Poorly made product.
5,No problems here.
5,Useful
2,Lasted 3 months before it stopped charging. Just long enough to outkast the warrenty. Wont buy again.
1,Tried this on 5 or 6 different devices (some that I have a power adapter for so I know they work) it did not power a single one of them. I will be sending this back.
5,good quality; plug doesn't heat up; works perfectly
1,I tried twice but it never worked. The problem might have been the polarity. The manufacturer could have been clearer about the importance of this factor.
5,Súper practico
5,WORKS EXCELLENT
5,Great product
1,I was supposed to get an adapter and 8 plugs. I only got the adapter! It is useless to me like this!

1,Junk don't waste your money did not work out of the box typical of Amazon
1,Didn’t work for me...the plug appeared to fit but wouldn’t power my device
1,Stopped working after about 30 days. Seems like as soon as the return window closed. Complete scam
1,The smallest connector is too big not returning because I don't need the hassle.
1,Product doesn’t fit anything that it proposes it will fit!
1,The Adapter and the replacement pieces were faulty. Nothing worked! I wish that I could recommend this product but I unfortunately can't.

1,DOA
5,I powered a small portable radio with this to use as counter radio and eliminate batteries - I needed 6VDC and it works great.  I measured output with volt meter at about 6.3 VDC which is good for low cost supply.The radio (gift) did not specify connector size so I bought this for its variety of connectors and did find the correct one.  I also like right angle connector as radio can sit closer to wall.  So it works well for me.  I didn't measure any other voltages so I cant comment on output except at 6VDC.
3,You get what you pay for. Product usually wears down and becomes relatively unusable after about 6 months. Will be looking for a more durable product because this one's wire is really cheap.
5,I bought this to replace cord for stationary bike.  Cord got lost when moving and had to replace.  Was easy with this. It has multiple interchangeable heads that can plug into just about anything.  Even came with micro USB.  Has a guide to help you figure out which plug you will need.
5,We needed a 5V adapter and all we could find were 9V.  This fit our needs perfectly.
5,Item as described. Well packaged! Fast shipping! Work great for my portable cd player 4.5V.
5,Got as a replacement for my dymo but because of the many attachments I can use thus for a lot of things
1,Doesn’t work on my voltage
1,I needed this for my Hardwire distortion pedal that requires 9.5 volts. It didn't work so I checked it with my multi meter and it found the output was only 9.2 volts.
5,Works perfect for any piano. Has a small key you crank it to whatever Volt your piano needs. At first my piano turned on but no sound then realized it needed to be cranked to 12v and BOOM loud and clear!
5,Works really well for my boombox and wireless mics.  Just set the voltage with the included tool you could use a small flat screwdriver too and find the tip that fits and you're off.  I really probably buy more for other devices I have lost the charger.  Just remember the polarity is non-adjustable this one is Inner positive and outer negative.I didnt really know what that means but I just matched the picture to my device.
5,I've purchased quite a few similar items over the years but this is one of the most solid designs yet. The mounting of the voltage adjuster on the back of the plug may seem inconvenient but it actually keeps it from accidental changes. Stepping between voltages feels solid and the range of plug adapters is good as is their fit.
5,I bought this product because I lost the plug to my daughter's keyboard during a remodeling project. It works perfectly. Don't forget to adjust the voltage on the plug! I love that it is adaptable so that if I ever find the REAL plug I can use this for other things.
1,Originally got this to recharge my pump about 3 of them fit but did not change them they were the correct one the pump required but didn’t charge it very disappointed but can also be used for multiple things so that’s a good thing
5,Received the product quickly. It is exactly what I needed for an Elliptical that was given to me & they did not have the adapter. Now I find out the Pin broke. Cannot wait to order the part and plug in my adapter so I can exercise.
5,So happy!! I lost an adapter that went with my Mickey and friends Christmas tree trimmers. I was devastated until I bought this! Thank you!
5,My dog chewed through my modem cable. I ordered this that night and the next day this arrived. I had internet again within moments. Super easy to set up and cuts out the guesswork with purchasing replacement cables.
5,This is excellent!  Easy to use...  select the voltage you need.. choose the correct adapter plug.  Plug it in and go it works perfectly.
5,It comes with several connectors which allows you to change the connector based o the voltage of the device.
5,Worked well
5,Very versatile. All different voltages and adapters
5,Was exactly as written fits perfectly this Universal plug is the bomb best price in the best bang for your buck
5,These get hard to find but this one is a good deal and I received it fast. Very pleased
1,Bought two of these to charge my NOCO genius boost packs. Plugged them in and over night both jump packs were damaged and unusable. Now I have to buy two new jump boxes. Strongly advise against these cheap pieces of ...
5,I'm extremely happy with the adapter.
5,It does a very good job ...
5,Seems to work fine.  Versatile.
5,Well designed and compact. Connectors attach securely.
5,Perfect
5,👍
5,It works Great !
5,Must have! Works great...
5,It works great.
5,Great I am happy.
5,Save money
5,Simply works.
5,Everything worked great  the 90 degree plug in was a little long so had to make a base to raise it.
5,Excellent replacement power pack for bayby's swing. Had the right plug and voltage setting also works for our keyboard.
5,Ok so maybe not that big of a deal but this is such a great thing to have around when you lose plugs to things like I do. Sooo much cheaper than buying replacement chargers ! I bought it for one of those round platic orb lights since they wanted a STUPID amount of money for a replacement charger. In the last month I've used it for a few different things. GREAT BUY!
5,Works like a charm easy to adjust.
5,I bought the same to replace a broken power supply for some lights for my daughter and this thing worked amazingly. It is easy to use you can set it for what voltage you need it has several different adapters to work with several different chords. I am so happy with this I couldn't be happier if I ever need a power supply that I can use for anything I will definitely be purchasing this again I mean it has so many different adapters and the settings for the voltage or nice where you can set the proper voltage it's just awesome
5,Worked perfectly for two applications. Awesome!
4,Easy to adjust settings and switch adapter ends. It works but not for all items. It may be a polarity issue (something which can't be altered with this product). I would recommend a different product unless you're certain this one will meet your needs.
2,In the ad this looked like it had a dial to change voltage. No it has a TINY slit where you insert the TINY (1/2") key and turn. (Key is center of the photo. Pen is for scale. Slit is red dot in center of charger.)The heads are not marked; just in a bag. Try them one at a time. Trial and error. Ridiculous! If this thing weren't so important to me it would be laughable. I am sending it back. I thought I was buying a REAL charger not a miniature toy!
5,Works great for many different devices. Highly recommended!
5,Actually came with clear instructions
4,Works as expected. I had to try on different ends to find one that fits my needs. So far so good.
5,I lost the charger for my Braun electric razor with a 2.5*0.7mm plug. This worked like a charm as a replacement!
5,it worked for my application
5,This was ordered to replace a missing adapter for a wind chime machine. It was perfect. About two days after the adapter arrived the original was found and changed back to that one. Still this is a great item to keep in the drawer for when you misplace your adapters because it covers all types of connector sizes and voltages. Alot of newer products come with this type of adapter rather than being hard wired for home outlets.
5,This best power cords multiple use pieces for 6v or ipads plugs or Android iPhone DVD plug. Camara plugs etc now i can power anything
5,I wanted to transfer  3 cassettes to MP3 format. I had not done this in several years now and as a result I had lost my power connector to my Cassette Capture. This item suited my needs perfectly. I believe it will also replace a power connecter to an electronic keyboard I have as well. It works flawlessly.
5,I have a couple at home like transistor radios a translator and some others .
3,Bueno. Esta bien .. Era lo k esperava lo k no m gusto fue no pude cargar mi lampara de mano con los cables extras que traia el equipo ..
5,Everyone needs this or will need this. It is affordable and very well made. I LOVE this plugin!
5,Super easy to use and allows you to connect multiple devices.
5,the price is great
5,When I learned that these things quickly drain bateries I wished for an AC adapter. The decoration listed the electrical specs but not the size of the connector. This kit had the correct size. It's feels well made and I felt comfortable leaving it plugged in over night. Very happy with the purchase.
5,There's nothing to dislike.  It's pretty encompassing.  Selected the proper fitting power piece set it to 4.5 volts and plugged it in to my wife's "battery consuming" Christmas train/music playing/ Christmas tree and lights  ornament.  Works fine. (works as expected)A single minor thought on a downside...  "This would have been astonishingly easy to make the polarity reversible."  (which it definitely isn't capable of)  Yes you could cut the cable to reverse polarity in the extremely rare circumstance that the center isn't positive.  But the seller didn't advertise this devise as reversible.  So this is just some musings on my part.  The device works as well and "exactly"  as advertised.
4,It works for what I bought it for to find out that it hahd a builded in system  for thar
5,Works as expected.  Easy to use.  Very versatile power supply.
5,Muy bueno
1,I used the product once and it stopped working.
5,Great
5,Instead of buying different wires just get this work wonderfully fit every electronics in my house
5,Replaced a lost power transformer.
5,Worked . Thank you
5,Got 2 of them because it helps me replace several that I either misplaced or lost. The price cannot be beat either. I've only had them for a week so I cannot comment on how long them last
5,Very convenient multi-usage charging cable for ur equipment. Also it’s easy to change output voltage.
5,This charger is a life changer if you have a lot of devices that have these female ports but all use different sizes. Should've purchased one sooner.
5,This thing is awesome!! I just received it a few days ago and it’s already saved the day twice.Great price; great idea. Just hope it lasts.
5,I bought this adapter for an old portable CD player...yes I still listen to my vaste CD collection. It works great as intended. I'm not sure I'll need all the attachments and various power options but I like that it's there.
1,Didnt work
5,Product exactly as expected.
5,Perfect for what we needed it for.
1,Returned.
5,I am using this outdoors 24/7 for 7 months and still going.
5,It worked perfect for my needs.  An added bonus that I did not realize it had was a "power on" light indicating the transformer was receiving power.
5,Electric Art Co wanted $24 for 9vdc xfmrs and these with male/female adapters are great replacements
5,Used it for power for CD player instead of using batteries all the time.
5,This is exactly what I needed - and more.  I love it that I can change the voltage and the adapter end so this adapter can be used with several different things.  Although I just needed the adapter so I could listen to tunes on my laptop!  Thank you!
5,I needed a 9 volt power adapter for my Drum KAT pads which I just purchased.  The pads did not come with a power supply but this Belker Adapter Power Supply works perfectly with the pads.  It was easy to set it to 9 volts and I double checked to make sure of the proper polarity and I was off in running in seconds.Great Purchase!  Thank you!
5,We needed a replacement pack for our Christmas village house. It worked so well we ordered a second
5,Had to replace a lost cord with an obscure 4.5V plug.
5,It is wonderful product which came to our rescue when the earlier one supplied with the Cam fro US got damaged
