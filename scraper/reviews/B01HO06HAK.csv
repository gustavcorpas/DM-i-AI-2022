4,This is a solid simple backpack. It seems fairly water resistant and is well constructed. The inside isn't just a big empty bag there are some extra storage pockets in the interior. It has a built in laptop pocket which helps keep things organized. The leather bottom is a nice touch as well as the leather tags on each zipper. If you're looking for a good simple backpack that looks nice I highly recommend this one.
5,This is the best backpack I have ever laid my hands on. It is made of high-quality material and the overall design is fashionable. All of the zippers open and close smoothly which is very significant. As well as this backpack has compartments for all sorts of items. Not to mention that the design allows me to take out all my belongings very easily without anything getting in the way. One of the best purchases ever made!
5,i can say that it is the most resistant and comfortable bag i ever had i paid 50 for it in 2019 and been using it for school work gym bike riding. still in perfect condition like new.
5,This is the second of this bookbag I've gotten because we love it. It looks nice I've had no issues with the quality of material or zippers and there are pockets inside to help with organization. The only thing I can think that could be improved is that the side pockets are a little snug for a water bottle but they've been able to hold a kids Contigo water bottle. All in all a nice bag.
4,the only complaint I have the zippers pully thing rips off everytime I zip my bag.  I think I can just tighten the actual zipper part so it can't break off but I expected it to work great overall. good bag though
4,My 11 yr old son really likes it. Says it’s roomy and has lots of pockets. Looks and feels durable. Seams line up and stitching is nice. It does not look cheap. So far so good. Happy with purchase. Hope this helps.
5,It was what muy daughter wanted for school this year.  Its been durable so far
5,Bought this for my Granddaughter for school.  It's exactly what she wanted with lots of pockets and big enough for her chrome book + all her other school items.
5,My son uses this at his middle school. It stands up to everything he throws at it. Very sturdy.
5,4th grader carries this to school and back and it is a decent sturdy bookbag. You can add other things to it to make it your own. Good buy
4,I love this backpack but the fourth week of owning it the leather part of the zipper came off while I was zipping it back up. Other then the minor setback it’s still an amazing backpack.
5,Storage capacity
5,My son loved it after I put the vinyl on!
5,Fit for traveling lot of pockets
5,Best for it’s buck
4,Filled with useful pockets and ample storage space straps are pretty comfortable. Laptop slot easily fits my 15inch laptop. With that pocket was lined with microfiber or something soft but does the job 10/10
5,Love it and it has a perfect size
5,This pack is good. I would like the side bottle pockets to be elastic.
5,Bueno
5,Me Agrado porque es muy amplia  y es impermeable
4,My son picked this one and loves it for summer school
4,The item is fine but I would recommend to not put a lot of items in the backpack. It is not as durable as I thought it would be. But other than that the bag is fine.
5,Ive had this backpack since 2018 and have used it pretty much daily. Originally got it for traveling out of the country and now use at as an every day bag and to this day its not fraying or coming apart 10/10
5,I bought this for my son to use his senior year of high school.  It’s the perfect size and not too bulky. It worked out great for a few months.  He did have a plastic adjuster in the strap break.  The company was quick to reply to my message regarding the issue they were very communicative and ended up replacing the item since it was within the 1 year warranty!
4,Update ilfrom the bottom comment:As you read my previous comment on this bag I really didn't like the bag. I first gave it 1 star but since their customer service has be absolutely amazing I'm giving it 4 stars only reason I'm not giving it 5 is because I still have to count in the fact I didn't recieve a good product  but I've been in contact with the company and they are absolutely amazing. Their customer service is 100% They're sending me a new bag of my choice. I've never met a company that would do this. They only would send you a refund. This company is very genuine. I highly recommend this company to any that needs a bag. They will do whatever they can to help you. I will write a new review when I get a new bagI just got this bag and I'm really disappointed. I really wanted to like this bag. After reading all of the reviews I figured this backpack would be amazing but that is so not the case.The material is a very thin plastic like material. The discription said it had a few zipper pockets inside which it didnt. Inside of the bag there was only the big compartment with a laptop compartment. The only other compartment was on the front of the bag which is okay but it's really small.The other thing that was wrong in the discription was the size. I righted the straps as far as they could go and the bag still didn't rest against my chest and back.The only thing this bag got right was the key chain holder inside the front pocket which was not the right one show in the pictures.All in all I'm very disappointed with this product. M going to reach out to the company to see if I can get a different bag or a refund.I honestly think I got a child's bag or a knock off of their brand. Cause there is no way this bag would get so many 5 star reviews.
3,Does not hold 15 screen computer
4,Feels cheap but it is cheap. I only needed something to carry a few things into work from time to time. If you're buying for school with textbooks or constantly have a laptop in it I'd invest in a Herschel. Not horrible but the Herschel will last through college. I'd give this a school year if that
5,This is in my opinion the perfect backpack.  I've bought two.  The first I bought about four years ago and it still isn't quite in need of a replacement.  When I realized that my first bag was starting to fall apart I found myself dreading buying a new backpack solely because I had enjoyed this one so much.  I bought this second one just as a back-up because I really beat my backpacks up.  I'm a college student so my backpack goes everywhere with me and this bag has been with me through spills and crumbs dropping it heavy loads mud and more.  It has just enough pockets so that you can be organized but not so many that it's impossible to keep track of where everything is.  It's lightweight it's not rigid and it's DURABLE.  The suede-like material on the bottom keeps it from wearing thin and the zipper attachments make it really easy to open and close.  The style is classic and goes with everything.  I genuinely have no complaints.  I've had bags that cost three times what this one does that last a fraction of the time and have less functionality.Long story short-- buy this bag.  It's absolutely worth it.
4,can't believe I just had the empty bag laying on my bed and getting ready to load up when a tab ripped. I'm already certain a few more are going down. good they give 1 extra tab but better to replace with  550 cord or something
4,Backpack tore in less than a year but promptly got a replacement without hassle! Great customer service! Will continue purchasing their products!
5,As a college student I have learned how valuable a backpack is.  In a years time this is my forth backpack. The others Showed wear and tear within a couple months. I’ve had this backpack for two months already and it still looks brand new. It’s comfortable and has a soft backing against my back.  I use it daily for school and work. It is very heavy after I fill it up :D  In side I have:  8 disposable face masks the top zippered pocket my laptop and mouse pad in the back larger pocket my iPad in the next large pocket two inside pockets for two large battery banks front inside mesh zippered pocket for snacks :-) inside space... 1” binder 1/2” Teacher lesson plan book 2” class book Change the clothes in a gallon Ziploc bag (required at my job because of Covid-19). Two full quart size fabric bags to carry personals and electronic accessories. Outside Storage: Cell phones in one side And a Water bottle on the other side pocket. Front pouch has pens hand sanitizer wallet and sunglasses.  I absolutely love this backpack. It has a place for everything I need. Oh I almost forgot. It has a little cord Port hole near the top so I am able keep the Phones charged on the outside While plugged up to a battery bank on the inside.
5,Muy buena
5,We bought this backpack and a year later the strap ripped away from the bag. We contacted the company and they honored the warranty even though we were three months past the warranty date. They were lightning fast to respond and sent us a new bag within two days. We absolutely love this backpack and we will be purchasing more in the future!
4,I was very excited to receive this backpack as I was in desperate need of a simple and durable bag. The back back itself looks even better in person with enough space in the small front zipper to store all your pencils and smaller items while the big zipper is capable of storing whatever larger items you may need to carry while also containing a nice padded compartment for your laptop. The main part of the backpack also comes with a nice mesh compartment with a zipper that I use to store my iPhone charger. Overall it's a great looking backpack this is the perfect size to hold everything you need without being to bulky. I do have some issues with the backpack though. I have been an owner of this bag for about 3 months now and I have begun to see some wear and tear on some areas of the backpack. To leave any doubt behind I do take care of my backpack and use it for school and that is it. Yet the mesh compartment immediately developed a rip in about a couple weeks that I've had to tape to ensure it does not get worse. Also about two months into my ownership I was slipping off my backpack and one of the straps tore about a 1/4 of the way through which I had to glue to also ensure it does not get worse. Minor issue with it as well is the bottom of the bag has developed a few miniscule holes but with it being triple layered it does not seem like it is too much of a worry. Also the laptop compartment comes with a Velcro strap to ensure your computer stays secure yet for me it does not reach the Velcro over my 14" laptop even though it is said to be able to hold up to 15". Overall I strongly recommend this backpack to anyone who is searching for a good looking simple backpack that is not too bulky but has enough space to store everything you need. Despite the issue I have with it I would still recommend this backpack to all.
5,This is backpack is great! I’m a junior in high school so I really needed a good spacious sturdy backpack for my stuff. This backpack is all of those things. I also put a drop of water to see if it’s really water resistant and it just slid right off no wet spots or anything! I don’t how it would stand in the rain yet but it seems at least a little water resistant. Anyways don’t hesitate to buy it! ;)UPDATE:Only 2 and a half months left of the school year and this backpack is still going strong. I bought it in October 2021 and it hasn’t ripped or anything- I carry a lot of stuff in it too!
5,So I had initially first bought this before school started for the school year of '16-'17. I was looking for something relatively compact but can still fit a lot of things in it and I decided to try and buy Vaschy's backpack. Unfortunately probably due to my manhandling of things and constant packing of notebooks laptops water bottles and another set of clothes for the gym The backpack managed to get a little torn at the straps within a month or two. However I realized it was most likely just me so I tried to be more careful with putting the backpack on such that the straps don't get even more torn. Because it seemed to be working fine and my girlfriend's old backpacks were falling apart too I decided to get this backpack for her too. The backpack she received was a little different than mine the material just felt different. Her backpack has been in use since December 2016 and it is still in perfect condition. However that was not the case for mine mine started to fall apart even more. Mine got to the point that the backpack's strap bracket thing broke and it was no longer usable. I asked Vaschy's customer service what their warranty entitled and they informed me that they had have changed the materials since the last time I bought mine and they asked if I was willing to receive a new backpack.Of course I accepted that offer and carrying everything as I have had before this new backpack has yet to shown any signs of wear.The only thing I have to say about Vaschy's backpack is that I can't really put my water bottle (hydroflask) in the side pockets. But then again putting it inside the backpack works just as fine for me so that doesn't really affect me much.Overall I think its a great backpack and they have really great customer service!
5,Todo super bien recomendado al 100
4,Aesthetics: 4/5 - It looks really modern and looks just how it is presented in the product photos. I love how many pockets it has on the inside of the backpack. I have not experienced using it in the rain but the material does seem like it would repel water. I think the straps that are used for the zippers aren't meant to last. There's nothing really keeping them on there because it's just looped around itself and I've had multiple close calls where I almost lost one of them. I know they give you an extra but I wish it was designed better.Wearability: 3/5 - I like to put my laptop some books and school supplies in this bag for school. I've only had it for a few months but the inner lining where there is a mesh pocket has ripped already. I suppose if you're using the bag carefully and not overstuffing it like I tend to do it'll be fine. It was still disappointing for it to have ripped so easily.Functionality: 5/5 - It holds my stuff and that's all I need it for. I've never had to wear it for extended periods of time but it doesn't feel uncomfortable at all even when I have multiple college textbooks and a laptop in it.Price: 5/5 - Pretty good price for a backpack with this many pockets and this well-made. When looking at the Herschel backpacks I chose this one because it looks similar but was way better in pricing (but also those pockets).Overall Rating: 4.5/5 - I use the backpack for school and toting my laptop around everywhere. It does what it's supposed to and it hasn't completely ripped so I'd recommend it. I even gave one as a gift to my boyfriend. He likes it too.
5,I should of just kept it for myself it turns out my city rather you inhale Carbon monoxide than be comfortable it makes no sense if everyone is wearing mask then everyone should be just fine if I decided to wear it especially when this virus is no more dangerous than a common flu if you wanna be comfortable I'd buy one or you can keep breathing in nasty ass Carbon monoxide you'll get sicker just breathing that I than you likely to catch and I quote the deadilest virus modern man has ever seen less we forget yellow fever small pox German measles last year's flu that ended killing more people in the first month that this I hate calling it a virus has in the 5 months it's been 418 people in Bexar county well if you lived in Bexar county and you didn't Everything our politicians say you would see 418 ain't nothing Bexar county is home to 6 cities including San Antonio  Austin  bandera Kerrville  San Marcos Seguin  and I know there's one more just can't remember it lol
5,Finally reviewing this backpack after buying it almost three years ago - it's held up so well that I have to recommend it for others. Roomy with loads of pockets and a convenient laptop sleeve well-built and made from very sturdy material. This guy's lasted through a lot of college wear and tear better than the Herschel backpack that I had before it and it cost less than half as much. I like it so much I'm buying two more in other colors to have for the future!
5,I bought this backpack to take to work. I fill it with food and drinks. Works great. I'm happy with my purchase and would buy it again.
4,Compliments:In all honesty when ordering this backpack I was concerned as to if it would be top-tier quality after reading some bad reviews and seeing the unusually low price. However upon receiving it and putting it into use for 4 months I had discovered that this backpack was most definitely top-tier quality.I am pleased with the various pockets within the backpack as it tremendously helps — even the most messiest people like myself — with organization and accessibility. Furthermore a fundamental part of a backpack has to be the zippers. There’ve been plenty of backpacks where the zippers eventually give in and become useless or get caught in the loose fabric near the zipper after extensive use (I’m looking at you Jansport). However these zippers do tremendously well under vigorous usage and stress. I’ve stuffed this backpack to the point where I was almost certain it was gonna rip somewhere but it all stayed intact and the zippers are completely fine.Complaint:Upon my awe at the durability of this backpack I had forgot about one part: the straps. Unfortunately on one occasion I pulled too hard on the string mechanism on the strap to make it tighter and it had ripped near the base of the backpack. Now I am forced to uncomfortably make my daily travels around school and one-strap involuntarily 24/7. Not only does it make me look like a douche but it really is physically displeasing.Other than the problem that the straps rip when pulled in a rough manner I was completely satisfied with this product and wish to receive a new one after reading about the 1-year warranty. Thank you for your time and thank you for the backpack.
5,Phenomenal warranty & customer service! Firstly I should mention the backpack itself is amazing it fits all of my schoolwork AND computer gear. I was blown away by how much more efficient this bag is compared to a Jansport of the same size. The vast number of pockets and compartments prove very useful. But their customer service? Just wow.Very fast replies to my emails. I somehow got an 8-inch tear on the inside lining of my backpack. It was quite irritating to look at and a little hectic when inserting pens or small books.Vina from Vaschy replied to me in less than an hour asking for photos. Once I sent the photos she got back to me in MINUTES asking for my address to ship me a replacement.Vina honored the warranty and made sure I had a new backpack at my door in no time. No hassle. I recommend this brand to everyone now because the prices are unbeatable the backpacks are damn stylish and if anything ever goes wrong? Their warranty and efficient communication times will have a replacement at your door in no time! :)I always appreciate a company that stands by their product. I would honestly pay 3 times as much for this bag if I had to and still be happy.
5,My son loves this backpack.  It holds all of his books papers and his laptop.  After 2 years of using the backpack it ripped and the company immediately sent a replacement.  We couldn't be happier with the product or the customer service provided by Vaschy!
4,I don't use this backpack for school but I use it for work. I carry my laptop the charger and other little odds and ends. I got the backpack yesterday and I really love it! The packaging was really nice. It came with a ziplock type bag holding the backpack and inside the backpack was another bag that resembled a bag you'd get at a nice shop in the mall with a little card addressing the person that purchased their product with a thank you. I was sceptical after purchasing upon looking at users pictures that the backpack would look filled out like the advertised picture but it does! I thought the backpack would look deflated and boring like other packs. It's small but actually has a decent amount of room. The weight of the item is relatively low and with items inside it sits comfortably on the shoulders. I have yet to test the waterproofing but as of right now I'm definitely pleased. I plan on buying multiple colors to fit my wardrobe and also to use on a motorcycle. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is scepticle. The only downside I have with it is the laptop sleeve. It has a decent amount of padding on the back side of the pack but on the bottom and front of the sleeve it feels very thin and I wouldn't trust it much to protect my laptop if it fell over or dropped on the ground. Would reccomend to add extra padding for protection. Other than that it's exactly what it says! Simple and beautiful!!
4,This back pack has been my daily go to.  It’s been on commutes camping trips and so much more.  The storage and internal pockets are plentiful and it holds a lot and still feels secure and sturdy.  And I get a lot of compliments on the yellow color to boot.I did have an issue with the internal mesh pocket separating and ripping from the front flap.  I only put tissues lipstick and some random loose change.  So not carrying too much.  But it’s at that spot where you zip the bag open and closed.  This happened after 6 months of heavy use and I procrastinated in reaching out to Vaushy.  THIS COMPANY IS AWESOME!!!  They are true to their word on the 1 year warranty if there is a defect and were very nice and responsive in helping me obtain a replacement.They have a customer for life even my daughter has the dinosaur one.  Thanks Vaushy team!  Removed just one star for the ripped pocket but I highly recommend.
2,Design and size were great but the side seams gave away a month into the new school year.  FYI-  this backpack was for my son who gets driven to school and back so he’s not carrying it long distances.  No problem with the bottom of the bag.
2,This backpack does not hold enough for a middle schooler. It does have a sleeve for a laptop but once the laptop is in there isn't much room for anything else. Also the small "leather" tags hanging from the zippers detach easily and often.
4,it is very small on the inside and doesn’t have a lot of storage however fits enough. I like the flatness at school because too bulky of a backpack is ugly.
5,Bought this backpack for my son and he loves it would recommend
5,Love this backpack.  It’s the perfect size not too big or small.  What I really like about it is the many compartments.  You can your store in different parts of the bag.  And I got at a modest price.
5,I got this at the begging of last semester. I am a graduate student and I use this for university. I mainly wanted something that can fit a book or two of mine (I'm a law student) along with my laptop other gadgets water can coffee mug and a launch box. This backpack fit all that and more!There is a padded pocket for laptops (although the bag is not padded at the bottom) and I generally like the internal pockets which I use for stationary.The only thing about this backpack is that I wish the side pockets were a little bigger. Sometimes I suffer to squeeze in my coffee travel mug and sometimes when the bag is full from the inside I can only use one of the side pockets (so either water or coffee). Otherwise I am glad I made this purchase. I was worried the bag would look too big for me (I'm a 5'1 petite girl) but it looks fine. I have mine in black and it is easy to clean and actually water resistant.
5,This is the best backpack! I needed to upgrade from a diaper bag to a backpack however I did not want or need a chunky diaper bag backpack. I wanted a smaller backpack that still had pockets inside mom and baby items and two side pockets on the outside for a toddler cup and the other to hold a glasses case and sunglasses case. THIS BAG IS PERFECT. It's SOOO LIGHT and fits everything I need without the extra room I don't need. It keeps its shape and stands up on its own and it's not so deep that I can't get to stuff at the bottom of the bag easily. My changing pad from my regular diaper bag and wipe container slide into the laptop pocket PERFECTLY. The zippers are really good quality and open and shut easily with one hand. I love the light grey color with the leather zipper touches. It's gender neutral and looks good on both my husband and I. I went through TWO OTHER BAGS BEFORE SETTLING WITH THIS ONE. I actually bought a Jujube Be Right Back backpack diaper bag and a Ancored East diaper bag backpack (with the wide zipper opening) and LIKE THIS ONE BEST. Again I did not need all the bottle pockets of a regular diaper bag backpack - if you DO need that this is not the bag for you. I highly recommend this backpack for toddler life on the go!
5,I purchased this backpack to replace my sons diaper bag. He’s 2.5 so I didn’t feel that we needed another diaper bag although we still need a bag of some sort for a couple diapers change of clothes sunscreen snacks water etc. I wanted to find a backpack with an ample amount of storage and pockets but something that wasn’t too bulky. I also needed a backpack that was unisex because my husband would be using it too. After  doing some searching on Amazon I came across this backpack and the video sold me because of all the different pockets. The front pocket I use for my stuff (wallet keys garage door opener sunglasses chapstick etc.) And then in the inside I use the big main section for a change of clothes the mesh zipper pocket for his immunization card random paperwork etc the top zipper pocket for his sunglasses second zipper pocket for sunscreen and bugspray the two smaller open pockets for hand sanitizer and snacks and the big open pocket for diapers and wipes.The quality of this backpack seems great. I’m actually very surprised this backpack is only $30.I’m overall very happy with my purchase!
5,I bought this for my 14 yr old son. His previous backpack hurt his shoulders and his back due to having no locker and carrying all his books in his backpack all day long. Since I gave this one to him he has not had any pain in his shoulders or back. Very good material and sturdy with plenty of space for Chrome book and all textbooks. I would recommend this backpack!!
4,Sorry I haven’t traveled with it yet so can’t really give it a rating. Seems tough enough to allow me to bring one or two iPads on the plane. Wish it had a chest strap.
5,Perfect backpack for a day trip or park. My daughter loves the color. The size is perfect for a toddler and an adult. we are really happy with it. We use it a lot for many things and we definitely buy more in the future since the price is good. Customer service really polite and respond quick to any questions or convers you have.
5,I got the olive green color and it's perfect. I was looking for a simple backpack for grad school. I'm able to fit four text books my laptop (with mouse and charging cord) a thick binder and my pencil case. That's not to mention the other odds and ends I've got in the pockets. I also love that there are two deep water bottle pockets. The backpack itself weighs so little that it makes even my heavy load feel easier.
5,I was in desperate need of a backpack and couldn't find one that I liked or that I was even curious about; This backpack is just about the right size. This has two water bottle pockets on the outside they aren't mesh but are the same black fabric that covers the entire backpack and they are tall too which will be nice to have because I don't want my water bottles to fall out. Has one big pocket on the front of the bag and has a clip on the inside of you need to chip anything in there.When you open up the back pack there is a nice slot to put my computer in and behind that there is a small little zipper area where I could put a couple of pens and pencils or even a pack of gum could fit in here nicely when you open it up fully and pull the flap back there is a mesh netting area that you can see through with a little zipper so it is closed off and has two medium sized pockets just underneath. Super happy with this product as I will be needing a backpack that won't be too big or too small to walk around my college campus and it will be nice to also carry my laptop around with me as well! I will be ordering from Vaschy soon!
4,Good pack back cool and functional only thing is the side pockets could be bigger when fully packed I wasn’t able to squeeze my hydro flask in it
5,I already spent over $300 on a WANDR bag but the problem is my Mamiya RZ67 kit wouldn't fit. Enter the Vaschy bag. I needed something cheap with simple large compartment. Adding a padded camera insert this turns a school bag into the perfect camera bag. I am comfortably fitting a Mamiya RZ67 2 film backs and 2 lens. The front pocket fits a light meter and rolls of film. As you can see there is plenty of room to stash a jacket or any other additional items. There is still enough room to utilize the laptop sleeve as well. If you saw this on the street you would never know that I'm carrying a full medium format kit.One thing I liked that I didn't think about was that the zippers don't go all the way to the bottom of the bag. This allows me to fully open the bag and grab what I need without everything coming loose. I weighed the entire thing and it comes in to a little over 10lbs. If I have to be critical the straps are a bit thin and I'm hoping the stitching lasts.Overall I highly recommend this bag.
5,Is my son love this backpack.
5,When I first opened it it looked really small but when I started putting my stuff in there it can hold A LOT of stuff. I was shocked.I also love the padded compartment for the laptop. It fits my MacBook perfectly.The side cupholders are a little on the small side but it would fit a bottle of water perfectly. Not made for anything bigger than that.I went with the pink and brown color. It’s more of a muted peachy pink and not bright pink (which I love)I just got this in today so I don’t know how durable it will be. Based on experience I would say it would last a good year MAYBE two.
5,I bought this for my 5th grader. He uses it to carry his laptop books supplies and water bottle to school and back home. It's been in use 4 moths...so far so good. It's a great value for the quality and there was a large color selection. Very happy with this book bag.
4,I really liked the appearance of this backpack. The dark green is a good shade and the accent colors look nice. The straps are simple and not too padded so it would not be a good backpack if you are carrying heavy things. I really wanted to keep it but it was slightly too small for my needs and I couldn't justify having two backpacks. Great choice for a day backpack or if you just need to carry light items! As a reference for the size of the side pocket: it fit my Blender Bottle water bottle but only just barely and was able to achieve this by pushing into the inside cavity decreasing the space available in there. It would probably work just fine with a normal size water bottle.
4,I was going to use it for school but I’m not sure if it’s big enough. It has a good height but the width isn’t so much. Love the color though :)
5,My daughter purchased this backpack to use for highschool last year. She LOVED this bag. It has great storage capacity and organization. Unfortunately one of the pockets tore which was going to prevent her from using it again this year. I reached out to their customer service department and they sent a replacement bag in 24 hours. I was blown away by their friendly and attentive customer service. I HIGHLY recommend this brand and bag.
4,UPDATE: As soon as I posted my review the seller reached out and offered a replacement and to work on the structure of the bag. This is fantastic customer service hence the added star (I declined only because I am looking for a wide mouth bookbag now).Decent book bag for the price but the inseam just above the inner mesh pocket came unthreaded and ripped after two months. I carried an old school Mac laptop one normal sized textbook and some notebooks. The mesh pocket itself held about 10 pens and pencils an eraser chapstick - your typical odds and ends for all day class. I would recommend investing in a slightly higher quality bookbag if you’ll be using it for the long run. I’m already on the hunt for a new book bag and I purchased this in April. Not horrible but not great for everyday use.
5,It’s small good quality and is light
4,Nice backpack - you won't want to get near it though. Well constructed sturdy very conveniently functional and excellent price. BUT IT STINKS!  Mine arrived smelling like a cross between burnt tires and gas fumes. I aired it out a couple days no change. Doused it with Fabreeze twice! That helped for 24 hours and the smell came back. It said it was hand washable so I hand washed it and hung it outside to dry in the breeze for 2 days. Looks beautiful. Still smells awful. As in you get within 3 feet of it and it hits you with the old rubber tire smell. I'm now Machine washing it against the labeled recommendation hoping for a backpack that's usable. I was hoping to put clothes in this and maybe my knitting when I travel but it just smells too bad to put anything in it.Review update - Customer service dept contacted me on seeing my original review and resolved the issue regarding this particular backpack.  I'm very impressed with their follow up and dedication to quality.  And continue to be impressed with how well made and functional the backpack is.
5,I love this backpack! I've had it since 2016. I bought it for college and have since then used it for pretty much everything. It's great for traveling on a plane. I've used it as an overnight bag as a gym bag and to carry heavy things when I need to. I love the maroon color and the quality is still great. Yeah it was a white scuff on the front but it doesn't bother me. It's still in great condition. There aren't any threads coming undone the straps have not detached and the zippers have never been a problem. I highly recommend this backpack! I hope you love it as much as I do :)
1,The zippers strings fall off of the zippers and it happens 3 times a day. They fell off like a week ago and I lost them so now I have to pinch the zipper to close the bag. The amount it can hold is also very little and you can barely fit anything into the water bottle pouch. If I have other things in the bag I can't even fit a plastic water bottle. Overall not a great experience. (I'm not sure if the zipper thing is just a defect for my bag or if it happens to everyone).
4,It is a great backpack for holding books for school.
4,I’ve ordered a backpack from Vaschy in the past.  I really like the quality and the style of their bags especially the style I chose. I did have an issue with my second bag many months after purchasing it. A seam split at the top of my bag.  It could’ve been from placing under an airplane seat.  Nevertheless Vaschy has great customer service they very quickly replaced my backpack no questions asked.  I can appreciate a company that stands behind their product.  I will continue to purchase from this company.  I am definitely impressed..
4,Price and style good for the price.
5,This is the second one we’ve bought for my son.  The first one lasted 2 years of school.  And it ended up just having a tiny hole at the bottom.  My son says they’re great from the color to the pockets to the weight.
5,Received a bag and within a few days the water bottle portion ripped but I contacted the company and they quickly replaced it and I received it within a week. Very great customer service and very nice bags. Never had an issue since. Buy from this company!
5,Cool little backpack I really like it. I liked the pockets on the inside and use them to hold markers scissors pencils etc. The only thing I didn't like about the design was the pocket that's against the back slot. I actually didn't use that pocket because of the way it's designed. If you have something (e.g a binder) in that back slot anything that goes in the pocket in front of it will either need to be small (let's say a pencil) or flat (a few sheets of paper) or you're going to have a hard or uncomfortable time putting it in and getting it out.
5,I 100% LOVE this booksack (book bag sorry I’m from the south and we call them booksacks 🤣) it fits everything so well!! I am able to keep everything organized. I use mine every single day. I use it as my “purse” as I only keep a wallet. Very durable and the material seems to be durable. No issues with it yet. I will for sure be buying another one when this one becomes retired.
4,Very nice build doesn't seem to collapse like my Jansport has. Surprisingly for this tight build I could fit a lot in it. Its strong exterior makes the weight much more bearable even with the fairly thin straps. I like its side pockets and earbud hole. Has a lot of nice little pockets to organize things. Felt a bit cramped inside though. Nice suede bottom. Wonder if it will pick up dust easier... So far impressed for the price. This will be competing with a Herschel Settlement (I am going to personally compare the two) but if you need a good strong bag for under $40 this is definitely worth looking into!Thanks!
5,This is a great backpack! It has a lot of storage space and I can easily fit my 15” laptop as well as a 32 oz. water bottle a couple of notebooks and a lunchbox. It’s worth the purchase!
5,I bought this backpack in 2018 for grad school and wore it almost every day for about a year and a half (recently I have not been traveling to school with the pandemic) and the backpack is still in great shape. It holds my laptop notebooks lunchbox water bottle/coffee mug and wallet very well and I am very pleased with the purchase. The integrity is better than I expected and I have had no major tears or holes in the bag since I bought it. The only issue I have had is the leather sipper ties sometimes come undone and you have to pull them tighter every once in a while. Highly recommend!
5,My middle schooler loves the backpack. She has been able to add her decorations to it and make it uniquely hers.  The only issue is that the water bottle pockets on the side are difficult to put in a normal sized water bottle.  Other than that love the bag.
5,This backpack looks even more sleek in person which i prefer over these bulky baggy ones. However it fits more than it looks while still hangs very comfortable on my shoulder with the padded back and straps. I love the 4 inside pockets and 1 padded pocket for ipad/laptop which makes it easy to organize. My 13 inch laptop sits snuggly with 2 thick books in the main compartment and pens in the smaller pockets. 2 water pockets on the sides are smaller than i imagined but my favorite small water bottle fits in nicely which is perfect as i don't like to carry a big water bottle with me anyway. I usually bring extra things for my son such as snacks books small toys. The zip front pocket holds all of them nicely.  Leather pulls on the zipper add a nice touch to this backpack. I was pleasantly surprised to find 2 extra leather pulls in a small ziplock bag attached inside. Overall i love love this product. Decently priced. High quality fabric/materials. Excellent functionality. Sleek shape and structure. Would purchase again in a different color. Wish they'd come out with more prints colors.
5,Got this bag for school as my regular bag I've had since senior year finally gave up on me.The material feels durable and the bag itself is spacious while also not being obscenely large or bulky. Seems it will be perfect for my notebooks laptop and textbooks
5,I bought this because I didn't want to spend the money on a Herschel backpack that was basically the same product. I'm a new dog owner and needed to switch from purse to backpack for convenience & this is doing the trick so far. It's comfortable light weight & easy to use as far as storing things/zipping/unzipping. I will say that the little leather (faux?) tags on the zippers will fall off quickly if you don't keep an eye on them but they're absolutely non essential. Lots of pockets fits my 13" laptop perfectly & I haven't experienced any defects as mentioned in other reviews yet (assuming these defects came from college students with multi-hundred page text books packed in there). If you're looking for a good commuter/work backpack this is perfect. Unless you need to show off a higher end brand as this is marked with "Vaschy" where a Herschel logo would be. No complaints here.
5,Edit:7-5-2018: I reached out to customer service for Vaschy. They were quick in their responses and diligent to make sure that what needed to be done to fix the problem was done. They shipped out another bag. Which arrived promptly and on the date they said it should arrive. Like the first one it was a lovely vibrant golden yellow great feel to the bag. So far it has been working wonders. I feel that this bag deserves the five stars because it is such a value for the size color richness the feel/durability and phenomenal customer service.Original post;Shipped and arrived when scheduled to. However when I opened package (was at the bottom of the rest of the items and opened with a small mail key) the right strap and right portion of the bag handle (where you would hang the bag from a hook) was sliced off. Sucks because the bag looks beautiful. The color is even more beautiful in person.
4,I received this backpack yesterday. Used it for the first time today and already the seam between the inner pockets of the bag has come out about 2 inches. Since it’s a small defect I will sew it up myself. The bag fits my books perfectly. Although I don’t carry an over abundance of textbooks/supplies in my bag it has ample room for everything that I do carry everyday and great pocket space to keep everything organized. Overall this is a decent quality bag for the price. The pocket where the seam is unraveling seems to be a poorly/cheaply designed addition to a nicely constructed bag. I look forward to using this bag for school. I don’t regret buying it yet but we will see how it holds up in the coming months.
5,We just recieved this backpack today.  It is exactly what I expected by the description and reviews.  I qill update as my son uses it.  We have extreme weather due to livinf in Alaska.  We will see how it does during our many rainstorms.  It has many pockets and the one inside of the backpack is cushioned.  Perfect for a laptop!  We purchased the maroon color.  I thought ot would be darker but when I pulled up the purchase. It is the exact color it's supposed to be.
5,Overall a good backpack. Actual product appears darker than the image shown though.Pros: - The backpack is designed for daily use or schoolwork it has ample space if you are looking for a school backpack or general daily use backpack. - The quality of the backpack is great. All the parts looks of great quality and can handle the daily use it also does not have loose threads. - It claims to be water resistant. Judging from its surface feel I think it most likely can resist water splash and light to mid rains.Cons:None I can think of I quite enjoy using it and would recommend it.The thank-you card found inside the backpack could use some design that is consistent with the feel of the backpack. Totally subjective here and this is the best I can pick about this backpack's cons.
5,I originally ordered a JanSport backpack for my middle school kid. Both my kid and I were disapointed with the Jansport backpack because the JanSport bag material felt thin didn't have a reinforced bottom and lacked compartments inside.We ordered this bag which was roughly the same price as the Jansport backpack and it was a world difference. The material is much thicker and felt more durable. The bottom is reinforced and there are plenty of compartments inside. It can easy fit a 15" laptop and still have room for more. It's well built. The only negative about the bag is the eyesore brand label on the lower right side.. BUT the label is easily removable with some small sewing scissors.. My kid really likes this bag versus the JanSport bag.
5,I bought this bag about two years ago and it has held up very nicely. For the price you're getting a very good quality bag that will hold a heavy load. I can fit about 2 heavy textbooks and my laptop without fear that the bag will break. It's not the most comfortable bag but If you aren't often carrying multiple large textbooks it won't cause any problems. I would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a cheap alternative to a jansport bag. Think of this bag as a slightly lower quality jansport bag. for less than half of the price!
5,I was a bit skeptical about this backpack because it looked small but my son really wanted it and it was actually a really nice backpack and perfect for school
4,It's perfect for the amount of books and such I carry around all day for highschool. It looks good and overall is a good buy. The material in the shoulders is a bit rough against my shoulders when I wear a v-neck shirt but other than that it is great! I'm able to fit one binder 2 notebooks one 5 subject notebook and either a textbook or more smaller books. I can also fit my water bottle and personal items easily in the bag.
5,I am a student and I switched to this backpack primarily because I liked the style my old backpack did not have side holder for water bottles (which this one does) and the cost. It has held up to use so far and I've had it a little over a year. If I had one slight complaint I wish the pieces that fit inside the zipper to zip/unzip were tied together or held together in some way but that's a very minor drawback.
4,Simple and neat.
3,Overall the bag is OK just wish the water bottle side push was slightly larger or  to fit a regular water bottle.
4,This was a good purchase for the price. Classy and effective. The sippers do kind of get stuck ok a oretty regular basis though. Only complaint.
5,I got this backpack in green 3 years ago and used it daily. I specifically searched for a backpack like this because I hate having big bulky many pocketed backpacks. This was exactly what I wanted and is still in decent condition just looks crap because I washed and dried it poorly. Went right back when I finally got tired of it looking like that because honestly if you prefer a simpler backpack this is awesome. Still holds plenty I've gotten a ton of stuff into these things and yet when I go lighter it doesn't deflate like a sad beach ball. Comfortable looks nice.
1,My child has been in school for 4 weeks with class 4 days a week in middle school and the seam has already fallen apart on the bottom. Of course it is 4 days past my return window. I am disappointed in the quality that it has already fallen apart; I had high hopes given all the other reviews. I cannot find a way to email the seller either.
4,Welp my son used this backpack for just over a year when the zipper finally gave way.  He is 12 and not kind to his belongings so it is reasonable to expect the zipper to give out.  Luckily when I reached out to their customer service they were responsive and helpful; they ultimately sent us a brand new backpack.  Now (if school would just open again) we'll be on our way and happy once more.  Thank you.
4,Purchased the grey one that fits up to a 14 inch laptop. I thought it was a washed out army green when I first opened the package which is unfortunate. I really don't like the color at all but I don't want to go through the exchange process for another because I need the bag for commuting to and from work.Besides that the quality seems fine. The fabric on the bottom is a bit rough and cheap feeling but it looks fine. The bag is roomy has a lot of pockets for organization and the straps seem comfortable. The nylon is waterproof which is great!Overall I would order again but I would definitely choose a different color.
5,This is a standard sized knapsack good for carrying a light load or a change of clothes.  There is a laptop sleeve but it's not heavily padded. The couple small pockets are nice. Overall this is a good value for the price.
5,Great for holding my laptop binder and several textbooks. Sturdy with plenty of compartments to put your belongings in an organized manner. I suggest you make this purchase especially if you need the space for your belongings.UPDATE: After a whole week of usage and constantly riding the train the bag itself is still great as used on day one. I suggest limiting the books you bring especially if some of those books are heavy. Do NOT try to overfill the bag because then it becomes heavy and incredibly difficult to close and all your belongings become smushed and unorganized.As for the "waterproof label" it becomes visibly wet on the outside of the bag but on the inside it protects the belongings. Not exactly what I had in mind when I saw it was waterproof but it's still good I guess.All in all the bag is great for college students and possibly younger students as well. Its spacey but always has a limit.
5,I've been looking for a backpack to use while traveling. I'm 5'1" so size is important to me. I wanted it to be compact and waterproof. I didn't want it to stick far off of my back to avoid turning in crowds or stores and bumping things.  There's padding in case I carry a computer or something fragile. The bottom is flat so I can put it on the floor next to me. It will easily fit under the seat in front of me on a plane. The padding does make it heavier than my non padded pack but the straps are comfy so I don't notice the weight while wearing it. It has 2 side pockets which fit water bottles and plenty of zipper pockets inside to organize in. The straps are adjustable and long enough should my husband wear it. I am very happy with my purchase. This backpack meets all of my requirements .
5,The backpack was used for school purpose. But I chose also travel since my child had to use store multiple materials daily for different activities. Now unfortunately the bag broke from the black plastic portion at the suspenders. Luckely this product is warranty. I contacted the company and received a new backpack with a couple of weeks. The experience with customer service was quick and efficient. I would totally recommend this item. The quality regarding water resistant and interior space is exceptional. Also I want to thank to Vina for her help!
5,The vaschy yellow backpack is a great bag. Holds my books and laptop with no problems
5,Love this backpack! I was worried about it being too small and sometimes I could use a bit more room - but only because I try shoving way too much stuff into here. It's pretty snug with my laptop and charger a small binder a couple of folders and a pencil pouch. I can usually squeeze in a small container for my lunch and my wallet and some knick-knacks in the inner zipper pouch up top. The backpack is holding up pretty good so far but I've only had it about three months. Sometimes it feels a bit fragile but it has not broken or worn down anywhere year. Biggest qualm I have is with the leathery-material that is attached to the zippers to make them easier to pull. If you pull them the wrong way they'll undo themselves and come right off in your hand! Other than that I really love this backpack and it looks great.
5,Great school backpack with solid durability. However if you get in a lighter color you’re definitely need to be aware that it will get dirty. And although it is water resistant it’s definitely not foolproof and definitely will mess up all your stuff inside you walk through actual rain (although you might be safe in just sprinkles). Lastly if you have stuff in the front mesh pocket inside the bag that’s a bit heavier when you have the bag slightly opened towards it sometimes weighs it down and causes the whole bag to open further or if it’s largely open it’ll flop forward sometimes spilling stuff.
5,I bought this backpack at the beginning of my sophomore year of college and it’s my main backpack I use for school/ travel. I’m about to start my senior year of college and it’s still in great condition!
5,I'm overall very satisfied with my purchase as I waited a couple of months of using this bag before rating it. I'm a nursing student so I have a lot of books/papers/supplies I need to carry around at all times and this bag is very sleek in design but holds more than it appears. It has held up very well and still looks brand new three months later! I only have one complaint and it's minor at best but the side pocket for water bottles isn't big enough but I like big water bottles and the pocket holds the size of a compact umbrella. My original bag broke in the middle of a session so I dreaded trying to find a new one that didn't cost a fortune and was reliable. I love this bag and would consider buying another one for travel or the gym.
5,Why i love this back pack.As a full time working mom this backpack helps me keep things better organized. I love all the pockets and zipped pockets available. I recommend if you are need of knowing where things are at immediately instead of having to dig in your backpack for days looking for something. Will be purchasing more!
5,I absolutely love this backpack. It’s a little bigger than the average but had so many pockets inside and outside. My water bottle fits well in side as well outside. Go for it you won’t regret it
5,Arrived on time and great packaging. Order this for my high school son. Stood up really well to daily use. Had one small problem. Contacted customer service and they had the problem solved lickity split! Would definitely purchase again in fact I did! Bought a different color for another kiddo!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This book bag is something I have needed for my college terms it has plenty of room for my macbook pro w/ case all my books and notebooks writing utensils and my phone. Then it has some more room in case you don’t have wireless headphones it has a hole where you can slide your headphones cord through and plug in your phone or device while looking stylish in this book bag. Highly recommend this bag if need for school travel or even work.
3,I like how it has space and everything. The thing is that the bottle storage came off all the sewing came off for both sides. But still use it for school
5,Holding up well after 3 months of daily use.  Still looks great!
5,Love this backpack storage is decent I can fit my 15.6" laptop in there fine and I still have room for my books. What I love the most of this backpack is that it's really water resistant. I walked to school while it was raining with a small umbrella that didn't cover my backpack and everything inside it including my laptop was still really dry!
5,First of all I want to say that this schoolbag is made in China and secondly the appearance and internal pockets and description of this schoolbag are the same. The most important thing is that I went shopping in the supermarket last week and I packed a whole bag which contained "apples bananas ice cream and roast chicken."Finally I want to say this bag is great!
5,The bag is good quality  it’s not a  luggage  So don’t expect large space it’s a nice everyday bag. I use it for work
5,My backpack broke about a month ago and I have been holding out on buying one because I really wanted a Herschel. My friend purchased a black Herschel backpack and I was super disappointed with the lack of features the backpack had for the price. (You are basically paying for the brand) I was traveling back and forth to my boyfriend's house with Trader Joe's bags and carrying my books laptop and notebooks to school in my hands. I read several reviews about this backpack and for less than thirty dollars I decided to try it out. I am very happy with the quality (it looks exactly as pictured) and this backpack is true to size. It has so many pockets and fits my 13" laptop perfectly! I love it and definitely recommend it for school or everyday use!
5,I bought this for my middle schooler who needed a large backpack for binders as well as a padded section for her laptop.  We don't know yet about the water resistance since we haven't taken it outside yet.  There are zippered compartments in the inside which is nice.  However I bought a different company backpack for my other child and that one seemed to have more compartments some with mesh and varying sizes which made it more user friendly which is why I gave a four star for traveling and storage capacity.  Still very happy with the purchase.  Looks great too.
5,I've hauled this backpack around almost daily for three and a half semesters. The build quality is surprisingly good for such an affordable backpack. I keep my pens some napkins and my meds in the interior pockets. The outside pocket has no sub-compartments but it works well enough for my keys wallet chapstick and whatnot. My only complaint is that the "leather" attachments on the zipper tabs look cheap and come off constantly but you can take them off (or replace them) without any loss of functionality.
5,I use this backpack for college and it’s great. Comfortable on the shoulders all throughout the day and fits a lot. For traveling it’s great as well if you really know how to use space wisely. On my latest trip I fit my computer charger water bottle snacks toiletry bag miscellaneous pouch (tampons chargers hand sanitizer etc) wallet phone chapstick sunglasses reading glasses a thick turtle neck and a light fleece Colombia jacket. So just know how to pack things well and it’s a great bag because it’s not too big but fits a lot.
4,UPDATE: the company offers a 1 year warranty on their backpacks and has made good on that and quickly provided a replacement backpack.  Very happy with their excellent customer service.  I’m hoping the first  backpack was just defective and the second will hold up.Poor quality.  My 11 year old daughter used this for school for a little over a month and the sewing for the zipper came apart from the backpack and the zippers fell off and it is now unusable.  Very disappointed given all the good reviews and the repeated mention of “quality” in the advertising description.
5,Love the product color came a little different than the picture shown
4,It is a nice compact bag. But whwn it comes to being compact this bag goes a little too far.But if you are fed up of taking a large bag to school and just want to carry your laptop and a few notebook this bag is good. Has bottle slots on both sides which again are way too compact.The best part is this bag doesn't look bulky on your back which waa thw reason I bought it.
5,Loved how vibrant the color is feels very sturdy
5,Great for traveling or overnight stays. May not look that big but the interior fits a lot of stuff. Sturdy and attractive plus the suede bottom adds a durable yet classy touch...very happy that I bought this backpack
5,I was not expecting too much when purchasing this backpack after having used the same Northface backpack for about 7 years. Just needed something quick and simple and not too expensive and this backpack met all those needs. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the backpack looks great and the zippers feel fine no issues after about a month of use. Plenty of compartments inside although the two side compartments wont fit larger bottled drinks. The only complaint I do have though is the straps are not really padded. When I start adding heavier items in the backpack the straps don't provide the most comfortable experience and wouldn't recommend this backpack if you plan on wearing it for a long time at once.
5,Bought this bag for my husband who is pre diabetic and has high blood pressure. We have to check his blood sugar and blood pressure multiple times a day so I wanted a bag with a lot of pockets so keep various things in (notebook for keeping track of food/test results snacks blood pressure cuff lancets alcohol wipes) all that good stuff. This bag has so many pockets inside and out I need more stuff to fill them 🤣 anyway I’m about to buy another one for myself because it’s such a good bag. And it was a 1 year warranty. Will update if anything changes
5,I received a defective backpack but didn't realize it until a couple months later when the backpack fell apart. I contacted Vaschy about the defect and they replaced it right away. They were wonderful to deal with and genuinely cared about making things right. The backpack itself is wonderful! It holds a 2" binder a 15" laptop a textbook and still has room for couple notebooks!  I highly recommend this backpack and the company. Thank you
4,It's so big and roomy! It has similar material as Jansport so it's not as sturdy as the Kinmac backpack I previously purchased (and returned due to the size). I love all the compartments and side pockets that actually fit a water bottle and umbrella. The laptop sleeve is a little short (1/2 of a 13" Macbook) so I might need to get a separate sleeve. I thought the leather bottom was going to be soft but it's rough but it's not a big issue. The straps and back are well padded but I hope the straps don't tear off after much weight. One thing is that the strap adjuster is a little too easy to adjust.. every time I slip on the backpack they shift. Great price for Herschel & Jansport look alike!
5,A warranty card is in the bag. Don't throw it away. You may need it. Their warranty service is very good.
5,This bag is great.  It isn't fancy or flashy and it feels sturdy.  I was originally worried that I could not find a backpack for when my daughter's original one broke a strap buckle.  I was also worried that her heavy loads would easily break any replacement I could find.  That was not a problem.  The bag is roomy and sturdy.  She can fit a school chromebook and a collection of books she uses each day.  Prime next day delivery was great It is most excellent.
4,Great backpack but the claim of water-resistant to me is off I love the backpack overall its small enough to travel comfortably but also big enough to hold a lot of items. It has held up well to being thrown around and beat up pretty bad. Great backpack but I would not rely on the “water-resistant” claim.
5,I purchased this for my daughter for school and unfortunately the zipper for the main compartment broke about a month into use. Because we purchased it in June and school did t start until August we were outside of the return window and I though out of luck.Recently January 2019 a customer service representative from Vaschy named Vina contacted me via email offering to replace the bag which once all of the information was confirmed happened very quickly.We are hopeful that the replacement bag performs well and holds up. I was informed that Vaschy has updated materials which should lead to better long term performance. If anything the customer service would influence me to purchase from this manufacturer again.
4,This bag will work well for my last few years of college and beyond! The zippers open and close nicely but feel like they might be a little weak meaning that if you put a lot of weight in the bag or toss it around often the zipper might open when you don't want it to. There is so much space and my 13 inch laptop fits perfectly. The only downside of this product is the overwhelmingly pungent chemical odor that clings to the bag for days after taking it out of the plastic wrapping. I had to open a few windows it was so bad. Asthma sufferers and customers who have a hard time breathing should take caution!
4,First week using it so I can’t really speak to its durability. It seems fine and my daughter likes it.It has lots of great useful pockets. The water bottle pockets on the side are an especially nice touch. They seemed hard to find on other brands this year.When it arrived it smelled really strongly of chemicals though. We had to hang it outside for days and it still smelled. I finally sprayed the whole thing inside and out with air freshener and then hung it outside again. Much better now but that was disappointing. That aspect is fixable but be aware that will take some effort and time.
5,When I first got it I left it on my bed and left. When I came back home my sister's cat was laying on it. The thing is... She got an open wound and the was blood. Yes she was treated. Then I cleaned my backpack. It looks just like new! ♡All I can say is I already love it! I live the color I chose. I love it! I've been looking for a backpack and couldn't find the one. Finally. :') I had also gotten a keychain to match it. I love it.
5,Quality was better than I expected. Lov all the space inside and out
5,ive never written a review ever but i love this backpack so much that i had to. the new backpack style is apparently to have one single pocket on the outside and zero on the inside which is so hard to use and fit all of my school stuff in. this bad has one big front pocket and two deep side pockets and there are at least 4 on the inside. it's such nice quality and ive had expensive backpacks before this and none of them are of this quality and this was for under $20. i usually have to get a new bag every year but i'm sure this will be the last one i buy for a while. i am incredibly happy with my purchase thanks vaschy love u
4,I have used this backpack for school/work and travel as well. It is excellent for carrying a 13" laptop and is very lightweight. Overall it has been a great backpack; however after little over a year of use the zipper comes apart when zipped closed. It is now virtually unusable. I still would recommend this backpack especially for the price.
5,I’ve used this backpack in the monsoon season in India which is definitely some of the worst rainfall I’ve seen and it always kept my clothes and electronics safe. The color and look is excellent and is very trendy. It doesn’t hold a ton of space but that isn’t as important to me as the look makes up for it.
5,Got this for my brother and he totally loves it. Great use when we travel and easy to carry and holds everything he needs at hand
4,It’s a beautiful color and great for traveling and packing light. Not a large backpack and initially intended it as a diaper bag but now just use it as overnight bag or for the airplane.
4,Strap buckles were terrible and broke second week that I had it. It is a cute bag and light weight but the plastic buckles were not strong and so it was not worth the money. Trying to figure out if I can cobble something together so that it is useable since currently it is so much wasted money.Update the company reached out to me as soon as they read my review and sent me a replacement backpack. I was impressed with the speed with which they sent a replacement at no cost. I love the light weight of the pack and it fits what I need it to fit I will just be a bit cautious about the buckles.
4,Love the streamline simplicity of this item. Enough usable pockets without too many. However the "leather" zipper pulls look cheap and the zippers are not the smoothest. I changed the pulls to leather tassels and that helps.  Also the fabric feels cheap. Looks fine though.  I'm going to distress it a bit to see if that improves the feel of the fabric. Other than that.... I love it. The straps feel great and the two outside "drink bottle" pockets are a nice bonus. My take is... at this price and the not so top quality feel  I can use and abuse it and not feel as though I need to baby it.
4,My high school aged son saw this on Amazon and wanted me to order for him.  I recommended a herschel but he wanted this immitation instead.  Good for me since this costs a lot less.  He usually goes through one backpack each year.  Build quality seems ok.  We will see how long this one lasts.
5,I can truly say that I am very disappointed with this product. While the backpack is much smaller than I expected I didn't really mind considering the fact that this backpack is advertised as "Water Resistant". I needed a back pack that did not let water seep inside the bag when it rains. I needed this because I hoped it would protect the many books that I carry on a weekly basis for my graduate courses. It just so happens when it finally manages to rain and this bag gets exposed to it for a little less than 2 minutes ALL of my books were destroyed. It's pretty demoralizing. I'm no longer going to use this bag and if any of you are hoping for a water resistant bag this is NOT a product you should buy.
5,This bag works perfectly for me. Im a college student and need to carry at least 2 textbooks 2 notebooks my laptop and room for my snacks/lunch whenever I take my bag with me to school. I'm able to fit everything in this backpack. It has a pocket on the inside for your laptop. I have a MacBook Air thats 13 inches and it fits snug inside the bag. There are also to small zippers inside the bag if you have little things thats don't fit on the outside pocket of the bag. I've had this bag for about 3 months now and everything is still holding on strong. What makes this even better is the bag has 2 pockets for your water bottles.
4,Much better quality than I was expecting. My kid loves it. She uses it for her school backpack so it gets used daily. We replaced a cheaper quality one that was the same price but started showing holes within 1 month of school starting. This has much better padding and more pockets. Very happy with this purchase.
5,Purchased this product in January 2017 by now (October 2018) it developed a hole. However after contacting Vaschy they agreed to send me a replacement which should be on the way soon. Thats good customer service  to me. I like how this product actually has side pockets for a water bottle/small umbrella as well as multiple pockets on the inside for better organization compared to the similar looking Herschel bag which has no pockets on the inside other than the laptop sleeve and a small phone/mp3 pouch. I just wish this bag was redesigned so that the tan canvas part wrapped around the full bottom of the bag instead of stopping at the back.
5,very pleased.  Worth and quality
5,I received the backpacks as scheduled.  The shipping was smooth and FAST!  I was pleasantly satisfied with the quality and size of the backpack.  I purchased it for my 9 year old daughter (she actually went on to Amazon and picked it out) and it was perfect for her.  Not too small or big at all.  My kids tend to stuff tons of things into their backpacks and at times they tend to rip or tear at the seems or by they straps so we'll see in time how durable this backpack turns out to be.  100% satisfied with this purchase!
5,This is a cute Stylish backpack.  It also has a Nice 1 year warrantee too! After several months of using this backpack the Inside of the small pocket area got a tear and after reaching out to the company about the tear and the warrantee the company’s customer service was excellent and replaced the backpack with no problems.  I highly recommend getting a backpack with a warrantee.  Kids these days have to carry everything in their backpacks because many schools don’t have lockers.  If it’s warranted that tells me they believe in their product and that it’s durable.  I think we had just gotten a bad stitch.
5,It’s a very sturdy backpack and i use it for school so it does hold all of my supplies very well.
5,Wonderful very functional backpack/bookbag. PLENTY of space you'll think it's the Tardis. Fits all of my 6-graders books spiral notebooks 9"x15" laptop cell phone pens pencils 9"x13" sketchbook 40 ounce water bottle you frickin name it. Deep large side pockets for larger cell phones or notebooks. Notice I included two pics one has a 40 oz beverage holder next to the backpack for scale. I've borrowed it myself for work and now need to order one for myself. Very stylish as well with extra thick enforced suede/nubuck bottom. Would DEFINITELY recommend!
5,Ordered for my daughter for school  she loves it just as described
5,This backpack is Awesome! Unfortunately I didn’t do a water resistance test yet but I’m sure it lives up to its standards. There is so much storage and room in my backpack. It can fit my 13” laptop comfortably and the backpack is also very light weight! (The pictures doesn’t have my laptop in it)
5,Bought the teal bag for my daughter and we love it! Lots of room durable and fits their style and personality! I seriously want one for myself!Update 04/29/19Bought 4 (one not showing) in 2017 and only 2 (black/grey & blue) are barely showing wear. Love these backpacks especially for my grade school children who can be rough with them. We will definitely be ordering again for the new school year! These are high quality bags and we would recommend them to everyone!Note: the black/grey one is smaller than the others (that was unexpected) but has been a great bag for my oldest. He carries A LOT in his back and it's just starting to tear at the seams.
5,I've been using this backpack for about a week now -- I'm a college freshman and it has the right amount of space for my laptop books and other stuff I lug around with me all day. I especially love all the different compartments and the water bottle holders on the sides they're big enough to fit my (pretty sizable) water bottle and it's never fallen out. The only issue I have is with the zippers -- the brown felt tags looked a bit tacky so I removed them and the zipper pulls are a little too short for convenient use without them. Other than that I love everything about this bag and it has been very useful to have for school!!
5,Bought this for my middle schooler who can admittedly be rough on everything he owns. So far it's holding up really well and the rather discerning kid it was bought for thought it was "rather elegant". I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it looked (loved the suede bottom) and really liked the small compartments and pockets. Be warned it's not super-large backpack (the kind a kid can cram a locker's worth in) but roomy enough for a kid to carry a good amount of supplies in.
5,is a good back i like and it feels good
4,Bought this for my 5th grader. She loves it. I wish it had more than one huge pocket and one smaller pocket for her to organize. But it is a good size and the straps are padded. The school year has yet to start so I do not have much to say about it but I will update this review if my view on the backpack changes.
5,It has been the perfect backpack for my first year of college! It has a laptop pouch that my MacBookAir slides in and fits perfectly! I bought this backpack and was originally concerned about storage capacity but it is perfect. For reference on the large zipper pouch: It has enough storage to fit a chemistry textbook and a 5 subject notebook (plus the laptop) and more small items like a calculator and wallet. I'd say it's a great buy for the price!
5,It is a great size it is not bulky or too small just the perfect size. I ordered it over a year ago and used it for college everyday use and now most recently it is a weekend travel bag. It has proven to be durable and simply fashionable.
5,Did you know this thing has so many pockets inside? I didn't! My son is elated by this backpack. He is entering 8th grade and is broad shouldered 5'9" and it fits him well. He was a little confused by the headphone Jack hole but that only makes it a little better because he is always listening to his music and now he can have his cell in his bag not pocket. Over all my son and I are very happy with the product and the swiftness of its delivery.
5,I am so beyond pleased with this backpack! The quality is amazing it looks great and is very comfortable on my back. This bag is so roomy I was able to fit:-7 school folders-1 three subject notebook-A wrist wallet-A 16.9 fl oz water bottle-Graphing Calculator-Mints-Mascara-Lotion-IPhone 7-A play script-Tons of pens pencils sharpies and post-its in the mesh-15" ASUS LaptopEven after all this there was still plenty of room for more books. This was also packaged very nicely it came in a Vaschy bag and included a thank you card plastic (I'm assuming) gift bag and extra leather straps. My only complaint is the zippers sometimes get stuck on the corners but this wouldn't stop me from purchasing this bag. I highly recommend it!
4,Great backpack although it is a bit smaller than I expected. If you just want a get-around pack for a couple text books maybe some clothes for a weekend or gym run it's really great. Tons of little pouches side pockets etc. Also looks great very well made and comfortable to wear.Again if you are a student with a ton of books this backpack probably won't be able to carry everything. I can only manage pens wallet phone charger laptop charger macbook and two physical chemistry textbooks. That's enough for me though so I'm loving it.
5,My son is 14 and wanted a backpack that was simple. We chose this one because it was affordable and waterproof. We have yet to test if it is waterproof but he's had it for a couple of weeks and loves it. He doesn't carry a laptop but he does have his textbooks which are heavy. He walks from school and the straps don't bother him his shoulders and back aren't sore when he gets home. It's comfortable and he's happy.
4,I needed a to get a back pack asap because my other one didn't have any interior compartments. This back pack has a lot of nice features. I could fit a folder my notebooks powerbank with cable earphones pencils box stapler calculator and so much more inside the many compartments. My only complaint is that the inner zipper bag has started to tear off. I would request a return but I need the back pack and it's not that much of a big deal.Update:Vaschy rep contacted me about a replacement but since it's a minor issue. I'm gonna keep it.
4,This is a backpack you need for travel or school. however its too big for me.The description says its a unisex backpack but I would say it fits better for men. I look like a kindergartner dragging along a huge backpack.But if you're looking for a big travel backpack or roomy one this is it!
4,The reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 because the bag has a weird smell. It still has the smell and I washed it 3 times and have been spraying fabrezz on it. The sent isn't as strong but definitely still there. I was afraid to wash it at first it was fine. I just air dried it. I put clothes in there for a day and the sent of the bag rubbed off on my clothing. Other than that the bag looks great. And after having washed it 3 times it's still in good condition.
5,I've had issues in the past with cheap floppy bags. They would have no structure they would be able to stand up on their own and they would tear after a small amount of use. This bag is not like that at all. This bag is so solid. Seems incredibly durable and I can fit all my books in it for high school. It's a perfect size. I wish the side pockets were big enough to hold a Nalgene but that's not enough to lower the backpacks rating.I think I'll be using this backpack for the rest of my life.
5,This book bag is better than I expected! The quality is AMAZING for the cheaper price and I know it will last me a very long time. I also love all the pockets in it so I can store all of my books binder laptop and even wallet and keys. Love the brown "leather" details on it too that makes it look more expesive. Simply amazing! So glad I purchased.
5,I returned the backpack after my dad bought me a totally different one but it almost made me wish my dad didn't love me enough to buy me things I need. It was almost painful to put this back in its box before I got to use it. This bag was very fashionable and the quality was great for a $33 bag. It definitely felt like the kind of bag you could use lightly for a decade when you go to your office job or for college when you need to smuggle liquor into your dorm.I highly recommend this bag if you want a compact soft quality backpack that will match your Tommy Bahama loafers and your Walmart-brand rain jacket.
4,I am going to do a basic review since I've only had the bag for couple days.1.  The material of the bag seems thick and durable.  The stitching between back  and front is heavy so shoulder straps stay in place.2  Nice leather bottom. It has a soft feeling.3. There is front obvious pocket. But it has two small pockets inside netted zippered compartment small zipper pocket on back wall and padded interior pocket. There is hole for headphones as well.4. The two size pockets barely hold 1L (33fliud oz) bottle of water
4,So I am using my bag for school and it works great. It's light its durable and there is much more room inside than it seems. The only problem I have is that the pockets for the water bottles are waaaaay to tiny. There's no room for a bottle that you would normally take to school. I take a small Hydroflask and it doesn't fit inside the holder. The bag is good overall but if you need to take a water bottle and your hands are full don't buy it.
4,This backpack is very nice well made good quality. However it is on the small side. Fits my 2017 MacBook Pro 15 inch just fine but storage in the main compartment is kinda limited. Still a very useful and cool looking backpack though.
5,I love this backpack. it carries most if not all of my daily stuff. I've even fit a light jacket in with my books and binders with ample room. when it rains I have no worries about my laptop getting wet.
5,I really enjoy how simple this bag looks.  I also love how this bag is not too bulky either.  This past school semester I had to carry 6 books along with folders full of papers and my laptop.  Everything fit just fine in the bag without it looking as though it was stuffed.  This bag can really hold a lot despite its small appearance from the outside.
5,This backpack is exactly what I needed when I walk to campus. I can fit multiple textbooks a folder my laptop pencil case tablet and all the tech accessories inside. There is also space for a water bottle in two side pockets. It probably wouldn’t fit a wide water bottle though.
5,This backpack honestly exceeded my expectations completely given its price! I've bought pricier backpacks in the past that have ended up falling short in quality but this one feels very sturdy and I can imagine it lasting a long time. It also has A LOT of internal compartments which I LOVE because it helps me keep everything organized. Many expensive name brand bags I've seen only have one or two compartments so this bag is like a holy grail to me! It kind of looks like a Hershel bag but it has more compartments and is only $30!!! THIS BAG IS EXTREMELY WORTH IT IMO. HONESTLY A STEAL. WOULD DEF RECOMMEND.
5,I just purchased this backpack for my 13 yo son for school and he LOVES it. I love it too. Great size. Fits his giant 3” 3 ring binder and has a few inside pockets as well. Not overly big (which I didn’t want) and not overly small either. It also came with extra leather zipper pulls which was cool. And it does have a warranty which I have not had time to read through yet but cool as well.
4,I love this backpack. It's everything I was hoping for. There are tons of inside pockets and zips and sections that keep me super organized. I would have given a full 5 stars but it smells really really stinky :( it makes me so sad because other than that i think it's perfect. I hate opening in class because I'm probably the smelly person in class or if someone is in line behind me I'm sure they smell it too. I've been using it for a month and it still stinks. Just be aware
5,I purchased this backpack a year ago but delayed my review because I wanted to test it out first. As a college student I am looking for bargains and this is a great bag. I was able to fit my 13 inch MacBook Pro three spiral notebooks three small notebooks lunch and a water bottle all at once. It prove to be water proof after walking 15 minutes to catch a train in heavy rain and none of my notebooks were wet nor was my computer. It is worth the purchase plus when I received it it came with a gift bag and a thank you note from the company.
4,Received earlier than expected. Beautiful backpack exactly what my daughter wanted. School starts next week so we haven’t put it to use yet. Seems a little smaller than other backpacks she’s had and they were pushed to the limit but maybe she won’t HAVE to carry everything around this year. It seems like a well-made bag.
4,update 12/3/18After I have posted original review seller reach out to me via email and offered refund or replacement. I have opted out for replacement and received it  in 2 days. Awesome  customer service + 2 stars.originalnice looking bag but the quality is not great. I bought it for my middle schooler and the zipper start to open by itself on a week 3 of use. Two month into school year and the zipper separated making the bag unusable.
4,The first one I ordered ripped from the strap. So I exchanged it for another. Customer service was easy and had a fast turnaround. The second backpack is still in one piece. So not to bad. It does what it's supposed to do.
5,Beautiful colors and material . Love it
5,I love this backpack so much! My laptop is a hefty 15" Asus and it easily fits in the laptop pocket inside which was my main reason for wanting a new backpack. It has plenty of pockets for pens pencils and other loose items as well as two side pockets for water bottles. There's plenty of space for books and notebooks without being able to carry an excessive amount on your back.
4,Everything is same as what is advertised.Waterproof is a big plus for the raining area like where I liveThe bag also has 2 sides pocket to hold water bottle (other similar brands dont have it)The size is good for school. I haven't tried to put my laptop in but I think it would be a little bit small for 15.4" laptopThe big negative side is this bag cannot be shipped to Canada. I have to ask my friend in the state to order it for me.I would repurchase in the future.
5,I actually like the backpack a lot. It's a good size and the material is pretty nice. My only complaint was there is sewing defect in the inner pockets. It looks like maybe they forgot to stitch a few lines to separate the sections on one of the pockets. Other than that it works for what I need it to. Update: The Company contacted me and offered a refund or replacement on the product. I greatly appreciate them contacting and the company seems to really care about customer satisfaction and the quality of their products. I will definitely up this to 5 stars for this reason
4,It's a nice looking knock off brand back pack with great build quality minimalist storage and great styling.ONE BIG PROBLEM!This product is not proportionally sized for adults. I bought this from the picture thinking it would be great for work but I look as though I am an adult ready for my first day of kindergarten. What is this? A backpack for ants?No adjustment of straps will make this work for adults who are over 5.5 feet.Smells good though.
5,I purchased a backpack before for the start of the new school year. My child recently encountered an issue with one of the big zippers of the backpack. I reached out to Vaschy and the immediately contacted me. They informed me they’d be sending a new backpack all I had to do was confirm address along with sending them a photo of the defect. The ease of their warranty process and their turn around time of receiving the new backpack was great. This all took place within the past couple of days.
5,My granddaughter loves this backpack
4,Really neat bag good price and I love the color!  It holds my books and is slimmer than most backpacks.  Only downside is is that is has a very strong odor that takes a long while to leave.  I left it by a fan for an entire day (directly facing the fan) and the smell is still there.  I figure that over time the smell will disappear but as of right now it's still pretty loud.Update : 10/18/17 Odor has dispersed.
5,The backpack is just the right size and it holds everything that I need: a laptop a few notebooks water bottle and a few more misc items. I love that the backpack has several pockets that can help hold little loose items and kept the backpack organized. The customer service is also great they helped me with an issue with the backpack by sending me a replacement right away. Will definitely recommend!
4,I love the book bag and the storage capacity but I have too many classes and binders. The book bag is good for a mall work load but I’m in college classes as well as high school classes so it doesn’t work. But I will keep it and use it for college next year.
4,Got this for my middle schooler. Took away a star because of the strong smell! Other reviewers have commented on the smell too. We aired it a lot and it seems to be a little better. Hopefully as she keeps using it the smell will go away! Otherwise it seems like a great backpack
5,I love it ! The price is so cheap and it is durable. I love how there are many pockets inside the backpack as well. The color inside is not wild like Herschel but I love it that way. I don't really like the brown things on the zipper even though you can remove them b/c they easily unhook themselves . It does not bother me b/c I remove them off anyways. I would highly recommend this backpack even though it is not a popular brand like Herschel. For people who have OCD like me this would be a great backpack.
5,I am entirely loyal to this company and their backpacks. They have the exact perfect amount of pockets and compartments for any day to weekend traveler or student. I regularily carry 2-3 textbooks plus an agenda and paperback and usually my laptop and it has served me well for my entire collegiate career (four years!).
4,Perfect basic backpack! Love the extra pockets inside but i wish the water bottle pockets were larger. Depending on what’s inside your backpack the bottle may have trouble fitting inside because it hits a folder so you’ll have to adjust the inside contents.I always bring my 21oz hydro flask which fits there well but when I bring my coffee hydro things get a little crammed. — they’ll both fit! Don’t get me wrong just a little snug
4,Color is great. The backpack is comfortable to wear and stylish according to my daughter. The only drawback is it smaller than it appears. It probably can fit a 14 inch laptop as stated but that would be about the only thing in it. My daughter can’t fit all of her homework in it. Not sure if that’s more a comment on the bag or the amount of homework. Lol.
4,School hasn't started so the backpack hasn't been used yet. Love the color and size. I'm sure I will enjoy using it.
5,Perfect for middle to high schoolers.
5,I started working for a job that requires me to move a lot and I just didnt want to get a big and heavy conputer bag especially into meetings. Its suttle and simple and although it may not have a strong professional feel to it it still looks like everything is well put together. I really appreciate every pockets placement in this bag making it easy to store so many things inside such a small bag. I recommend this bag if you are like me just starting out in the business and finding balance between financially friendly and classy style bags~
2,My strap ripped within one year of use while traveling. The stitching just busted through which was rather disappointing since I liked the look and storage capacity. Guess I’ll be looking for another backpack.
5,My daughter agonized over a new school backpack.  It had to have enough storage.  The straps had to hit her small frame in the right place.  It had to have a water bottle slot on the outside.  It had to be durable and not have early zipper failure.  This is it.  She loves it and it is just the right volume for middle school debris.
5,The backpack appears to be well-built for heavy books. There is ample storage allowing for books and a laptop.  Hydro Flask did not fit in the side pocket but  soda bottle or water bottles fit comfortably. I would recommend this backpack
5,I've had this backpack for awhile now and it's honestly still good as new and I use it for traveling and school! I absolutely love it!
4,When the bag first arrived one of the seams was not closed. Customer service was very fast to respond and super helpful they sent me another bag to replace the damaged one. I am happy with the size of the bag it isn't too bulky and holds everything I need for my classes. The material is stiffer than I thought it would be but over time it will break in.
5,Is oxygen bottles the reason they made this bag? Probably not. But that’s what I’m using it for and it was the best purchase I’ve made to carry those heavy ass bottles. Can fit 2 medium sized canisters and while I did almost fall over getting up from a seat it was pretty easy to get around also the padding is so nice on my back. I love this backpack and I so appreciate the sellers for making my poor sick sad life a little easier.
4,I like it. It's pretty basic like me. It fits my Aspire E 15 laptop.... ya know the cheapest yet well rated laptop on Amazon... but hey it looks fancy next to my Starbucks. The black is as black as my scarfs and the brown accents match my Uggs. I've already gotten a compliment on it from the girl at Sam's Club who's about 10 years younger than me. So I know I'm on point. I only wish it had a bit more padding for my laptop but whateves.
5,I bought this to replace an old Herschel backpack. The quality is definitely lower (not very much padding in the straps or in the laptop compartment) but it's held up well to almost a year of regular use both in school and getting stuffed as a carry-on. I like that there are a lot of pockets. The laptop compartment is not well-padded but I have a laptop sleeve that I use and I think that protects it pretty well. Overall it looks great and is surprisingly durable.
5,Mi niña lleva usándola mas de un año y todavía conserva sus costuras y su buen material. La única observación no tan positiva es que la parte de abajo marrón se va desgastando y perdiendo su color quizá fue porque la lavamos muy fuerte. Tengan cuidado con eso.
5,This backpack looks great. It's very simplistic without too many pockets which suits my needs.  If you're looking for a Swiss Army backpack you may want to move on but if you don't feel like you need to many pockets inside of pockets you may try this backpack.  The only downside that I noticed came mostly when I first received it.  The zippers seemed to be pretty loud and jingly.  But after filling it with my books and notebooks this issue was almost completely eliminated.
5,I love this backpack. I have used it for one semester so far and plan to keep on using it. The design is simple but that's what i like about it. The laptop pocket inside keeps my laptop snug and its not uncomfortable to carry. It has kept my laptop and books dry from the rain may times. I don't carry many things in my backpack so i can't say that it holds a lot of weight but I can tell from the quality that it will be more that enough for the average college student.
4,la única pega que le puedo encontrar es que el sello cocido de la marca desprende mucha pelusa del hilo. no se si se debe al calor de mi pais (Rep.Dom) pero es lo único de lo que podría "quejarme"
4,One strap ripped from the bottom of the bag within six months. It was difficult finding contact information to get a replacement bag but once I found it Vaschy delivered the replacement within a week.
3,UPDATE: The backpack is nice!! It has rained a few times since my purchase and it has kept everything safe and dry. However after the first time it rained I notice these water marks. I thought it just needed time to try and it would be good. Well it dried and the spots never went away. I washed to see if it would help and it didn't. It sucks cause they are very easy to spot. Other than that the backpack holds up really well. If the seller has any idea on how I can fix it help me please. I don't know if I just got a lemon but don't let my review stop you from purchasing it!!!!Just like the pic! Can't wait to wear it out I'm NYC so will see how it does with the rain since it is water resistant... I'll let you know in 6months how this holds up
4,This is a solidly built and sturdy backpack for any kid to take to school. It might be a little small for someone in high school. The side pockets do not stretch and won't fit most water bottles but you can jam a small umbrella in one.
5,Daughter loves the color black but I was hesitant to order this bag in that color but the brown leather tones makes it look great. She’s very pleased with the bag and it has a large compartment for storage. It’s also the most durable of all the backpacks she’s had so far so I’m giving Vaschy a thumbs up!
4,The main reason I bought this bag was the style. It looks beautiful the colors are vibrants and the material is nice. Has a decent amount of space but if you’re looking for something to hold a bunch of books this is not for you. Find a bigger bag.
5,Even though you see the majority of students having the same design bag once you have it on you understand why a lot of people would buy it. The pockets inside and out are very useful and keeps your lost pens visible. The extra leather accessories on the zippers however is something I’m not a fan of because for one they easily fall off if you grab it the wrong way. So far it carries my notebook 13 inch laptop case and a textbook and it’s holding up pretty well.
5,Muy recomendable para escuela en mi caso soy estudiante de medicina y me logra caber 2 libros muy grandes. 1 carpeta de argollas. Y 2 cuadernos además de una laptop.Mi laptop es de 15.6 pulgadas y todavía sobra un poco de espacio.Muy duradera el único problema es que si llueve. No se transmite nada pero la tela se queda ligeramente manchada.
4,I liked the style of the backpack the most! Which I think is just as important as the storage capacity or other factors that make a backpack great. The style is what drew me in and caught my eye and it is probably what led me to buy it!
5,Just returned from an overseas trip in which I used this backpack as my daybag and it performed great. With a larger bag as my carry-on and this as my "personal item" there was no need to check luggage. It's well made and resembles the similar but more expensive Herschel backpacks.Reasons I'm giving this bag 5 stars:- quality materials and craftsmanship- perfect size for day trips (like a more convenient and versatile handbag)- small enough to count as your "personal item" when flying
3,My 8 year-old daughter has been using the Vaschy backpack for school since May 2019.  It's roomy and practical. Unfortunately the shoulder strap of the original ripped after less than 4 months of moderate use raising quality concerns. The Vaschy customer service was excellent however: Within a few hours of making a warranty claim via their website I was offered a replacement which arrived a few days later from Amazon.  It's too bad that the original bag which was in good shape but for the ripped shoulder strap will end up in a landfill as I don't think it can be repaired.  I hope this was an outlier or that the quality of the product improves.
5,no issues
5,This is a simple backpack that has more compartments than meets the eye.  If I'm being critical it would be nice for the front pocket to have some compartments as it is large on its own.  Overall that is a minor thing.I've had this for over a year and have used it on an almost daily basis.
4,Zippers are a bit finicky but I guess you get used to them after a while. Has lots of room for whatever your needs are. Stuffed it with 2 laptops and a bunch of cables and it did the job.
5,Darling color choices - my 7YO is really happy with her new backpack!  It fits great on her but could easily be worn by an adult as well.  Smart pockets enable her to use air pods (if we actually trusted her with them...) and quality zippers and straps.  We got ours for a special price on Amazon day but even at full price I'd buy it again.
5,I needed to purchase a backpack for my 3rd grader that could fit everything they need to take to and from school and home and this one works very well! We went through 2 other backpacks (different brands) in a short period of time the first one not including a side pocket which we appreciate for water bottle storage and the second one having a zipper that malfunctioned immediately. This one is spacious the straps are comfortable and after the broken zipper of the 2nd backpack we tried the smoothness of the zippers on this one is refreshing.
5,This is a great sturdy backpack that appears to be working for a very long time. Very well-made and the fact that it’s waterproof is a plus. My grandson loves it because it fits all of his stuff in it. This would also make a very good travel companion. Excellent quality.
5,I love that this backpack is so big! It is great for school and traveling and it can comfortably fit my 16 inch MacBook Pro. The quality is solid and the design is cute. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a book bag that is big but not too big.
4,I purchased for our granddaughter for going off to college. She is very happy with it.
5,Purchased 2 of these this year.  Bought a Burgundy one for my daughter the quality was so nice I turned around and ordered a Black one for her best friend.  Both girls bags are loaded down with 10th grade gear and seem to be handling it well both bags are in great shape both girls are very happy with them.
5,I purchased this backpack for a week of theme parks and I am so happy with this choice. The bag had everything I needed - a compact size plenty of pockets and well-padded straps. At no point was I uncomfortable wearing this backpack for hours on end. In addition you can tell that it was built with quality - thick material vibrant colors and nice leather accents. I can't wait to use it on my next adventure!PROS:- Very comfortable to wear- Great internal and external pockets- More aesthetically pleasing than other brands.CONS:- None!
5,I love this backpack. It resembles a Herschel backpack for the price can’t beat it. I am able to store my Mac book hair ( has a sleeve for it ) and I am able to put other things in it such as books and notebooks.
5,I love my backpack. From the day it came it was the right size light weight has just the right amount of compartments and my laptop fits nice and snug. I would recommend this bag to anyone. P.S. one thing that was not so great was the rubber things on the zipper the look cool though and they dont take anything away from the bag for me i could take them off and it would still be a great bag.
4,Searched Amazon for hours to find backpack options and so happy with this one! I'm a law student and this bag is both cute and great for carrying a laptop and books. The separator section inside is helpful for protecting the computer as well!Four stars because the zipper started to get stuck / jam but it could be just mine it happened to.Love this bag!
5,I love this backpack I've received many compliments about it. It has been packed to the brim with textbooks a hydroflask and my laptop and has held up very well. There are lots of extra little pockets on the outside and inside to create additional storage- however if you were hoping to squeeze your water bottle into one of the outside side pockets...chances are slim that it will fit. Overall great backpack and one of my favorite Amazon orders to date.
4,I like the product I bought it for taking stuff to work and it fits a lot of stuff comes with a year warranty and the product is great so far
5,Beautiful colors. Bought if for my second grade daughter and it fits her laptop large water bottle and folders perfectly.
5,This product exceed my expectations. What caught my eye was both the style and price of this product. This was cheaper than the Herschel backpack with the similar style. The materials itself felt great and I love the suede bottom. The main compartment was fairly sized with many different pockets with and without zippers for any objects you don’t want going around in your bag. The front pocket was also a good size. You can also fit an average sized water bottle (the plastic ones basically).
4,Good backpack for teen high school use. Laptop and books fit well and extra zipper pulls with leather sewn in support at bottom seems to be well made
4,Sturdy great condition and holds as needed
5,Excellent product
5,I bought this backpack for traveling through the airport. I always use bags with one strap.. this bag is a game changer. There are 2 pockets on each side one zipper pocket in the front and two zipper pockets on the inside. Would be a great bag for traveling or toting books to and from school.
5,If your a college student like me I'd recommend you into purchasing this backpack a-lot of room and pouches to store items you may need for a quick reach. Has a dedicated spot/pouch for a laptop which is to pull out and convenient. If you are taking a-lot of classes were you carry many notebooks and books then this backpack is not for you. I'd say this backpack for students who don't require to have a-lot of books or notebooks with you.
4,Very good backpack. I used as a school bag a traveling hag and a camping bag. The water resistance is considerable and there is a decadent amount of storage. A very good school bag.
5,I have been enjoying my new backpack for a few weeks now.  It's attractive well-constructed and is keeping me organized and on the go.
5,Absolutely wonderful backpack. Been using it for 3 weeks now and I have got no complaints whatsoever. Fits my 13 inch laptop easily and has plenty room for notebooks.
5,School
5,definitely waterproof!!
5,The backpack is great! I bought it to take with me on my most recent travel. My laptop fit in just right. I was happy to see that inside of the backpack has different compartments. I was worried that the straps would break because of how much I filled the backpack. It was heavy but it help up well. I was surprised. It's great quality. The size is nice too. The color is super nice and modern. Overall it's a good quality backpack great for school or even in traveling. Best backpack I have owned.
5,My daughters will be using their backpacks for middle school this year.  They were able to pack up their huge list of binders paper pens pencils markers etc..with enough room.  The backpacks are sturdy and well constructed.  We were very happy with the colors.  One daughter chose the lilac and light blue and the other chose dark blue with the suede bottom.
5,Purchased two of these quite a while ago. Still going strong with lots of durability. Have thrown them in the washing machine never faded or went out of shape. An excellent product. I don’t remember what I paid but I think it was a very good price
4,My middle schooler picked this bag for trekking to/from school. It's roomy enough to fit her large binder and her flute. So far the quality seems good (I'm a little worried about weather durability once the rainy season begins). But let's be real: as an 8th grader the style is more important than anything. She's a big fan of the look of this backpack and very pleased with the purchase.
5,This product was great. It lasted me a year but eventually wore down (as has every backpack I’ve ever used so I don’t necessarily count that as a terrible thing). The biggest bonus I’ve found about this backpack is the warranty. They saw my damage and immediately replaced it for free. Also when I was using it it held everything I needed and looked great. Great for a sub $30 backpack.
5,Thinner fabric and doesn't keep a solid shape. Which really effect the use of the bag just is more of an aesthetics thing. I really like it! There are a lot of dupes tho so I’m sure if you looked around you could find the same bag from a different brand.
5,My son has been searching for the perfect backpack. He's a junior in high school and for the past couple years we've probably spent a small fortune looking for the something that is practical but looks good.We have some 'name brand' backpacks that were ok but were either too big or the zippers would fail or didn't look just right.Finally he found the best of all worlds and it didn't break the bank.He loves the suede/black combo as well as the inner details. It fits his bools calculator laptop and lots of small stuff.It's all good!
5,Even though this product says its for teens I use this backpack for college and I like it a lot. The pocket is a perfect place for my calculator for Math for Teachers and I mainly have online textbooks so the fact that there is only one big section benefits me. However the color i saw online is not really the color I received. I think online they made the backpack look very bright when it is not.
4,Great backpack for back-to-school. Generous size. Good leather pulls for zippers. Solid bottom for frequent dropping on the floor/sidewalk/pavement/etc. My only complaint is that when the pack is full the pocket on the side can't really hold a water bottle. I would have liked to see some spandex or other elastic on the side pockets for that purpose.
4,I absolutely love this backpack. Perfect design size quality material. I’ve only had a few weeks of school so it hasn’t been tested too much but I can already tell it’ll survive this year and beyond. Best part is the color and the reinforced bottom so it doesn’t wear out over time (that’s what happened with my last backpack)
5,It's rugged it HOLDS WATER (I had a water bottle full blown leak and had no clue).  I'm very pleased with my purchase.  I've been using it for a couple months now under some pressures and it's great.
4,I purchased this bag for my daughter for school.  It worked for a while and then the zipper busted.  Since we purchased a high quality bag and have had no issues.
4,I used this backpack intensely for school and it made it almost to the end of the year before the shoulder strap began to unravel from the bag. I contacted customer support and because the backpack was under warranty I received a replacement within the week.
5,I love everything about this bag. The construction is sturdy and the fabric seems to be rainproof with a nice range of inner pockets including a laptop sleeve. The capacity is great—I can easily fit all of my school stuff and even some groceries when necessary. Due to the type of fabric the zippers never get caught. The burgundy color looks great in person. As a grad student I love having a bag that looks sharp and reasonably professional but still has a casual look.
2,The straps are too close together so they cut into your shoulders. The zipper feels really cheap and the fabric will probably not last long.I'll use it for a while but I'll probably have to get a new backpack once I get tired of the painful straps or the zipper inevitably breaks.All I carry in it is my laptop battery pack extra battery pack mouse and some pencils and stuff. If you want to use it to carry more stuff or heavy books I wouldn't recommend it. The straps are angled really poorly and it will not be comfortable or hold much more.
5,I have been using this backpack for the last three months and absolutely adore it. I have had no issues with rain getting in and my books are not damp at all. I also use public transit and it has held up very well. It looks exactly like it did when I bought it. I work 40 hours a week and don't feel awkward bringing this backpack into the office. I never thought I'd really like a backpack after always finding them practical and durable instead of something I've actually enjoyed. I have become loyal to this brand.
5,Got it for my gf during Prime Day. Good price and it looks cool. Only problem for me atleast is its size. It fits all her books and her 13.3 inch MacBook Air just fine. But on a bigger person (5'5"+) it would look rather ridiculous. I'm about 6' and i put it on and it looked like a toy backpack on my. My gf is 5'2" and it looks pretty good on her though so it works.
5,I keep finding pockets everywhere and there is so much room and the backpack is sturdy and looks amazing however the suede on the bottom gets stuff on it constantly
5,I use it too carry my laptop lunch and other work essentials.  The first day I bought it we had a torrential rainstorm here in Florida.  After a 1/2 hour in the rain all my contents were bone dry!  The heavy duty straps make even a heavy load quite manageable.  I would recommend this backpack to anyone.
5,Been using this backpack for almost three years now for school work and travelling. I got stuck in a thunderstorm on campus and was really worried about my laptop getting ruined inside but there wasn't even a drop of water that got in. For sure would buy again.
5,It came in perfect condition. It's more square shape but that's probably bc I just got it. It is water resistant. There's alot of storage capacity. I think I'm going to like this backpack
4,Good product and good price
4,I love the design and the comfort of the backpack. Only downside is the space. There is plenty of small storage for your wallet phone etc. But not as much for books and notebooks. Over good product if your on the go.
5,I am a graduate student so I need a backpack that will fit all of my things and this one does! I can comfortably fit my computer notebook book and a jacket without feeling like I am going to break it. There are plenty of pockets to keep things organized. The only thing I don't love is that the side pockets are not flexible so you cannot really fit a water bottle in it.
5,The bag arri ed and I'm simply in love! The bag is beautiful just as described in the product page it looks resistant to water (didn't test it yet).The storage is big and it's comfortable on tha back. I also travel with it so the laptop case is very useful.
5,I am using this light weight good quality backpack for daily commute over year and still going on. It is perfect for carry water bottle lunch box some personal things in front pocket and folders. On top of that The  customer service is excellent. Typically they response within a day. Great product & customer service. Will buy again in future.Thanks
5,I love it!All of my daughter’s books for school fit I like that it has a pencil box pocketside pockets
5,I really love this and the many inside pockets it has. the only thing I dislike is that the leather zipper tags sometimes falls off but I guess  thats why it came with extras. Really great quality and it hasn't fallen apart with our daily use for almost a year now.
4,Took it on a flight with united airlines and worked perfect for under seat personal item. Get this one if you are worried about size.
4,This purchase was for my daughter and her school work. She was very happy with the backpack.
4,Great quality. Seems durable. Comes with lots of compartments. Only complaint is that the side exterior pocket is not mesh and therefore doesn’t stretch at all. I have a larger water bottle and if my backpack is full it is a little tough to get the water bottle in the side pocket. Other than that I love it. Would definitely recommend.
3,Nice backpack but we didn't have it very long.  It lasted about 6 months.  BUT in fairness it was used by a high school senior (boy) and was stuffed to the gills carried a heavy load beat thrown swung around shoved in lockers etc...  we haven't had much luck in getting ANYTHING to last more than 6 months through his high school career so this is about average.  While 6 months isn't a long time I'm not really disappointed considering the rough wear I know it received.  It was okay.  Did start splitting along the sides where the back straps joined to the main pack.  Bottom was nicely reinforced though.  Pack was big enough to carry everything he needed most days.
4,My daughter loves the book bag nice color and large enough for all her books and water resistant. The downside to the book bag is that it has a strong moth ball smell to it the smell is so strong it must be due to the packaging that the book bag was in ( the plastic). Besides that the book bag is nice.
3,Updat: They refunded our money and the smell eventually went away after airing it out with baking soda sashes for a couple months.Well made. Original reviw: Our backpack smelled like moth balls and it still does to spite airing it out and putting baking soda in and on it to absorb the odor.  Otherwisr this would have been a great bag.  When i say smells I mean it is a very strong smell that I would be embarassed to carry this bag for fear that others would think I smelled bad and it is unpleasant enough I don't want to smell it myself .  I am going to have to throw it away because I keot it past the return window which is my own fault.
5,Med student here. I was looking for a professional looking bag that I could use as an every day- carry. This holds my 13" MBP as well as having enough space for notebooks and books. There is quite a bit more space than I expected. Great product! I removed the label off the front of it they could have put that on the side. I wish the side pockets were a little larger to carry a water bottle / coffee cup; they are only big enough to carry a plastic water bottle.
5,Great bag love the color. Lots of pockets. Sturdy. Much better than carrying a bag.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BAG! It’s such a roomy backpack to have without it actually looking huge. Love all the pockets it comes with. Would definitely recommend for students who carry so much paperwork/ books.
5,I didn't have an overnight bag for a weekend retreat and was able to fit everything I needed into this bag. This bag also comfortably fits my 13in macbook air and 3 folders a 5 subject notebook my planner my japanese textbook my portable charger my wallet and my pencil pouch. Only problem is that if the backpack is pretty full it's harder to fit my water bottle in the side pocket. Also the shoulder straps are okay they could be a bit more comfy.
5,My SO carries a lot between herself and our 16 month old who also cloth diapers. Plenty of room and storage space. She loves it and the color.Unfortunately our dog also seemed to like it and chewed the straps off. There is a warranty included with the bag but we assumed our pup eating it wouldn’t apply. We gave it a go anyways and found the customer care was fantastic and had a new bag to us two days later.
5,This is a present for one of my twin daughters about to begin 5th grade. She will carry everything and anything in it for an entire school year. I have opened the package as yet but she will tomorrow and if she has something to say about it she will tell me and I shall convey to you.
5,Love it!!!! Super cute and more than enough space for multiple binders or towels and bathing suits for two. Really love the variety of pockets too very helpful for staying organized. Used it consistently for a semester and vitually no signs of wear and tear so pretty durable too.
5,Its a pretty good backpack. I like the color and it works great for me. I use it for work and so far so good. Lots of pockets to use. Very durable. Easy zip closure.
4,My daughter can fit all of her homework supplies inside of it and all of her work doesn’t get wet when it’s raining
5,Very nice.  All the way around.  Perfect for business owners  tech travelers  and any form of organization for school or work.  This bag is the real deal.  I got black and brown and absolutely love the design.  Extremely durable  and for the price you'll be highly surprised.  If you're in the market for a nice professional bag this is what you need.
5,Great backpack. Very good storage capacity for a midsized bag. Nice modern design for both girls and boys. Amazing quality for the price
4,My son got this backpack for his first year of middle school since he now has several  notebooks and books to lug around. He says he likes it so far but the straps aren’t padded like his last backpack and the side pockets don’t stretch to carry his larger water bottle.
5,I got the backpack in yellow. I was first attracted to the vibrant colour and now so many people have told me they feel the same. It’s crazy how water proof it really is like the rain just slides right off! There is more than enough space for all your things! I only had an issue with the side pockets not being big enough for my water bottle😭
5,This backpack is the best!!!! It came in the mail in perfect condition and is very well made it even comes with a 1 year warranty if something is wrong with the backpack. Also I did not realize there were all of these pockets in the backpack my last backpack had just on big pocket and the front pocket and I would lose things in it constantly I do not see that being a problem with this backpack. Not to mention it looks great too!!!
4,The backpack has durable material keeps it shape and like all the bags in it. I recommend showing the inside with all the bags and zippers inside happy to have all the space within it to hold all of my little things.
2,This back pack only lasted me 4 months. It is already ripping!
5,Definitely water resistant! It's lightweight and can hold most heavy textbooks. Inner pockets are great to store away your computer charger or sticky notes. I only think that I didn't really like is that the side pockets of the book bag are too tight/small. If you want to fit a water bottle on they sixe you will struggle a bit to get it in there. Other than that this is a very great book bag for the price.
5,The customer support was super attentive to my needs and was really helpful! I’m thankful!
5,This backpack is great quality for the price. It has tons of pockets and is more spacious than I expected. I got a backpack from a different seller that was not as useful for more than 2x the price. When I received this one I immediately took the other one back.
5,I bought this for a trip and love the quality & design of the backpack. Easy on the shoulders with a lot of storage space. Great for traveling & for school for lightweight things. I'd recommend it. I got the black one.
5,I got this backpack for my husband and he loves it! I was a little worried about the quality because it was very reasonable but the quality seems very nice sturdy and well-made. He uses it on his weekends and no problem so far. We liked it came with a card and pretty shopping bag. That was very sweet. The backpack has 1-year warranty so that was a plus too! If you are looking for a classic lightweight backpack I highly recommend this!
4,Straps are kinda hard/rigid which makes it uncomfortable sometimes. But if you're used to that already or just don't care about it the backpack is pretty much as advertised.Really like it.
5,This is a very modern clean looking backup.  It has a decent storage capacity and the build quality seems to be of a high standard. The only thing I wish they would have included is zippered left and right side pockets or side pockets that at least had a velcro flap.  Small items cannot be secured in side pockets without fear of them slipping out. Not a deal breaker though still a good backpack.
5,Other packs with mesh side pockets rip easily.  these side pockets are solid fabric.  No ripping.  fits a 20oz hydroflask.  My son loves it.  No one on the playground has this back pack so super easy to tell him apart in the crowd.  also the brown front piece can fit a keychain which all the kids love to hang on their packs these days.
4,Different which is good
5,My son just got this for high school. He wanted a backpack that doesn’t sag when loaded with books. So far this seems sturdy and room enough for his iPad a few notebooks and his lunch. For the price it seems like a good quality pack. I’ll update later if anything changes.
5,Bought this for my 8 yo in September. So far very pleased with it and it’s held up nicely. It is a little big for him- a good size for me but it’s working out with the straps adjusted to the shortest lengths.
5,Love this bag and the way it looks. I have put two 1 inch binders 3 spirals and my 13 inch MacBook Pro in the main slot and a pencil bag in the small pocket in the front and I still have room for more. I have yet to actually start using it for my classes but will update my review when I’ve used it for at least 6 months.
5,I bought this bag for my daughter. She needed something durable for school that would afford plenty of room for all of her books and a few art supplies without being too bulky for her 5'3" 115 lb. frame. This was a perfect find. It is plenty big enough without overwhelming her. I also appreciate the reinforced bottom. I bought patches to sew on to it to make it her own. Overall a great buy.
5,Love this backpack! Good amount of space for storage and so easy to organize! It looks great and feels even better.
4,nice book bag not to big not to small just right for me...
2,This backpack has a decent amount of room for a basic backpack.  The number and size of pockets is nice.  The quality however is not there.  The fabric is cheap.  It doesn’t look like it would be very durable and it looked like it was bought from a cheap knockoff site
4,I bought this for my grandson for school. It seems to be working out find from school books to football equipment.
4,Product matches the description
4,It's nice its very sturdy and the material is good it was a little smaller than I expected but it can fit:- One two Inch Binder-One one inch binder-A pencil case- A plannerand it has more room for about another one inch binder
5,Love this backpack. The straps are comfy especially when I am carrying all my text books. My laptop is 15.6 inch but i think you could carry something a *little* bigger but not much. Lots of pockets for storage. The color is the picture is spot on.
5,Nice
3,Granted we did not actually take measurements of the backpack to be replaced but this backpack is rather narrow in terms of space for folders chromebooks and everything else we needed to move to a new bag for school. The material is not giving at all so it just isn't going to work for our needs. We will re-purpose it for something else.
5,Purchased for my 15 year old daughter. She loves it. Colors are vibrant and just like shown in pictures. Backpack is a very good size. Not to small or big just perfect. She’s a JR in HS and this fits 3 binders her laptop a couple of books and more!
5,In the design and how it looks I liked it like the spaces they have I offer what I expected.
4,Bought for my daughters 1st year of college this backpack is very sturdy durable plenty of space for laptop. Comfortable.
4,Decent backpack overall and sturdy for the most part but the mesh pocket inside the main compartment rips very easily. The zipper pulls tend to come off when you pull on them wrong. They are easy to replace but I would prefer if they stayed on in the first place.
4,I received my order the other day and I love it! I have not used it for college yet but it looks pretty sturdy. I bought the Maroon/red bag. The color is even prettier in person. The only downfall is that it is a little smaller than I thought. My binder barely fits horizontally.
5,It has a lot of pockets and durable for any high school student. Recommend if you have those classes that ask for extra binders. Haven’t tried the waterproof but no doubt it’ll workUpdate : it still works like new. I recommend by a lot. It’s worth the price!!!!
5,This bag shocked me. For the price it’s durability is amazing. I carry about 25 pounds most times and there’s no wear and tear. I can fit everything I need for school and more. Traveling is good but I would recommend it as a school bag
5,nothing to complain! my Spectre x360 (13.3 inch with thick leather case) easily fits in this bag and small pockets inside and outside are extremely useful.  Bottle holdera on both sides are wide enough and the overall quality seems great! Have only used for a week but the material looks and feels extremely tough.  After all simple design is the best!
4,I wanted a small backpack to use as a Carry on this fits the bill size wise it could use some more dividers and a back zipper compartment on the rear of the pack otherwise I like the quality and size I will make it work
5,Good quality daughter loves it for school.
5,Bought this for my son and he's pretty rough on back packs. So far it's held up great. It holds everything he needs to carry. Zippers are sturdy. The color was spot on.
4,Use this as a diaper bag one of the best I’ve found so far.
5,Amazing quality  true to its words ^_^
3,This backpack lasted me less than 2 years it began to rip and in rainy days some water went inside. It’s cute but not long lasting incest in a better one that will actually lasts
5,My daughter uses this at college and loves it. Holds a lot and doesn't look like every other backpack. We don't get much rain in SoCal but it's done well so far fending off any drops.
5,I love that this bag is big but it doesn’t look big. I can fit my 15” laptop in here and so much more. It’s somehow made so that it distributed the weight so that it doesn’t feel heavy.
5,I recently bought an electric scooter and needed a way to carry stuff while keeping my hands free. This is a nicely built roomy back pack with comfortable straps. Just what I needed. I couldn't rate it on water resistance haven't had it out in the rain.
4,I bought this backpack specifically to keep my laptop and notebooks dry but it definitely cannot handle pouring rain. My notebooks and all the contents of my bag are soggy and wet around the edges. The backpack itself is good quality and can handle a light sprinkle of rain but it is more water resistant not waterproof. It was shipped quickly.
5,The gray is very stylish. It's well made.  My son ordred it for college and uses it everyday.
5,So durable and stylish. Bought it for my boyfriend and he loves it
4,I needed a back for short hikes and room for water a light jacket binoculars.  This fits the need.
5,And a good price especially compared to some others I've seen in shops.  Seems to be good quality.  Good zippers.
4,Love it! Pretty durable. It lasted me 1 semester and it probably would've lasted longer if I would have not over-packed it with my laptop and books so many times. Also there's multiple pockets on the inside! Super great backpack. I'll probably buy another for next semester.
5,My son loves this bag. He bought it for his school needs. He loves the quality and style of the bag. It has sections which is different from the average back pack.
5,Got this for my middle school kid who goes thru 3 backpacks every year so far this one is lasting and it looks like it’s gunna be durable enough to last the year!!!
5,The backpack is a great buy and will surely fulfill the needs of either school a gift or everyday life. The inside is pretty roomy and the outside material feels very nice in the sense that it's very strong and probably won't tear. Considering that it is water resistant we haven't tested it yet but from the looks of it water isn't coming in the way of this backpack. Also the sellers are very kind. :)
5,I was skeptical of purchasing a backpack online however this backpack is been very useful and capable of holding all of textbooks there are multiple spacious pockets to hold my supplies which allows me to stay organized. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Highly recommend this backpack for any college student!
5,I think there's at least 3 big pockets on the inside and 5 other storage areas inside as well. I really just love this backpack. It smelled like a pack of moth balls exploded on the inside my girlfriend wondered why the room smelled like a retirement home and kept referring to it as such until it took a few weeks to mellow out. But! The quality of these for city life are supreme!
5,This backpack has been well. I have been using it as a diaper bag. The leather pulls on the zippers come off easily and tear. They do provide spares which is helpful. This backpack reflects the price well. It’s not the most comfortable backpack I’ve owned but I do enjoy the pockets.
5,Before this product I used a larger jansport bag. I was worried about the smaller size only one main compartment and the relatively low price; but it works surprisingly well and can easily carry multiple textbooks spirals and all of my accessories. Love the design.
4,not as great quality as I expected but nonetheless a good product
5,Best backpack I have ever had! Great on price! Has multiple pockets inside that range in good sizes. Very light but sturdy. I got darker red and is true to color. Only problome is the side pockets arent really big enough for a water bottel but great for keys and glasses. Hasnt been in rain but I trust it. 10/10 already recomended to friends.
5,This is a great little bag! I originally bought it for my son for college but it’s actually a bit small for that so wouldn’t use it for a school bag. But we took it on a trip to Europe and it was perfect for day trips and extra items - very lightweight compact and comfortable not at all bulky or awkward.
5,Great small backpack that fits a 2016 15" MacBook Pro with plenty of padding and no problem. Beverage carriages on the sides are not quite large enough for my bottle but they're big enough for a normal sized water bottle. Materials feel high quality no stray stitches or broken threads on the first look over. QA out of the factory must be good. Hope it lasts a while!
4,Quality but much smaller than I thought.  Should have paid closer attention to capacity
5,Very nice backpack for school college or traveling. Handy practical and comfortable. Definitely worth its price! Excellent material quality. Space availability to keep a laptop journal books or folders. Many pockets to place your belongings even to place two water bottles.
5,I love the color how there is a lot of room inside and how light it feels :). I love this backpack🤩!
5,Use it almost daily for going to-from work and the gym. Not too bulky has enough different compartments to it and has been holding up well thus far. Looks like the more 'trendy' Herschel bags but at a much better price point. Happy with the purchase.
4,My daughter loved the vintage look of the bag so this is the one she wanted for her 8th grade year.  While the bag is very sturdy it's a bit small.  If your son/daughter has to carry a lot of stuff this bag may not be the best choice.
5,I've been using this backpack since the start of this semester. And I must say i lovee it! It's water resistant!! I've walked outside in the pouring rain without an umbrella. When i got home I opened the bag to see if it was wet and magic! Completely dry! It has a great amount of pockets. I use this for everyday even when I'm not in school and it still looks brank new. I would definitely conside buying another color.
3,I’m a junior in high school and I keep two binders in my backpack as long with five to six folders and two 16oz metal water bottles. I over all a good backpack but I just have some much that I keep in it there a hole in my backpack but it’s still usable overall. But I have only been using it for about a month now.
5,It’s fire
4,The bag is smaller than expected. But had more pockets than expected on the interior of the bag. the colors are very vibrant.
5,Nice quality with lots of inside pockets.  Bought for my daughter to use at college.
5,I really love the color of the bag it's so vibrant. But due to the light color it can get dirty quickly so that's just something to keep in kind. But I honestly love this bag.
5,Color was vibrant. Bag is of good quality material. I have a 14 inch HP and the fit was perfect. It didn't look like it would fit initially. Good quality bag for the price. The additional pockets came in handy. I had plenty of room to get everything needed for school in this bag
5,Amazing backpack!! I love it so much!! I can fit a 1 inch binder two spirals and three small books in it no problem plus my pencil case! The size is what compelled me to buy it and it did not disappoint! I got the teal green one and it’s so pretty! I am definitely very happy with my purchase!
4,Good product but leather zipper pieces come undone often and break easily.
5,my grand daughter loved it.  thank you
5,Plenty of room. Several compartments but not too many. Lightweight. Easy to pack. Easy to carry. Good value.
5,Perfect for school.  Especially in the north with the snow.  All my notes And books stay nice and dry.  Also very durable and very easy to take care of.
4,The backpack is of high quality and looks as good as pictured.  I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because as another reviewer noted it does have a very strong "new" smell.  My guess is that it comes from the agent used to make it waterproof.  Hopefully it will go away soon.
3,The zippers to the main compartment of the bag would move but won't zip up the teeth. I only had one 13 inch laptop and a water bottle in this new bag brought it to class for the first time literally sat there for 2 hours and when class ended and I was about to get up and leave the bag won't close. Terrible product.Update: changed it to 3 stars because Vaschy decided to replace it for free and they were really nice about it. Hopefully the new one lasts.
5,This was a gift for my granddaughter. She is a junior in high school. She is very happy with it. It has plenty of room for everything she takes to school.
4,Just a generic canvas backpack nothing fancy. Got it because my daughter wanted to sew patches all over it.
3,I loved this backpack when I first got it but it definitely is not as strong as other backpacks. Within 2-3 months of use the bag started developing small holes here and there the straps were also very weak as I would be afraid to use the bag in case my strap ripped off. I never stuffed the bag or added too much too it it mostly had my laptop charger wallet and two books. I would love to still be using it but I invested in an underarmour bag instead which has the support in the straps.
4,This bag is great but it is not waterproof. Aesthetically I really like it it has useful pockets and is well structured. However I specifically purchased this bag because it said that it was waterproof. I live in the Pacific Northwest and a normal Fall day of rain will leave the bag damp on the inside.
4,It’s a nice backpack good quality. The down fall is my 7th grader can’t fit a binder iPad text books and lunch bag all in the backpack at once. We have to buy a bigger backpack.
5,Delivery was incredibly fast !  The product is tough enough to hold up to a teenage boy who drags it with him all over town and school.I especially like the reinforced bottom and the lightweight material the body is made of.  It's a Christmas gift and I may end up buyingtwo more of these sturdy backpacks for his sister and brother.AL
4,Received it in a reasonable amount of time. Package was sealed but came with a little dent. The backpack was how it was described. It had an odd fume to it so I had to air it out. The laptop strap isn't long enough to strap around it. But other than that great for its price!
5,My son really likes the backpack.  he is using it for Jr. High school.  The initial build quality appears very good.  Time will tell if it holds up to the demands of a teenager and a school year.
2,This backpack was exactly what I needed it to be just the right size the zipper only stayed closed if you put the zippers on the side (which not a bad thing) but the inside lining ripped 3 months after purchasing this bag. I am really sad about this but I guess when you buy a cheap bag you don't really expect this to last that long I guess. I really liked the bag itself but if it can't even last 3 months of school (only a laptop and 1 textbook in it really) then I  really can't like it. I recommend it for a cheap bag maybe for super light-duty but if you want to use this every day for school and have maybe 15lbs in it a day then get a better bag
5,This is exactly what I needed. The material is pretty sturdy and it is water resistant. I wore it during a snow storm and nothing leaked through. The laptop sleeve fits my Macbook Pro 13" perfectly and there are a lot of slots to keep my things organized. Overall I would recommend this product. It came true to color as shown on the picture.
4,Vashy bag does it for me. Second piece after a satisfying 1st buy.
3,I have loved my backpack. It is a good size and fits all I need. It is very sturdy and the outside fabric is holding up very nicely. The inside black lining got a tear and as much as it bugs me it's mostly cosmetic and no one can see it except me. I love the overall quality and pockets provided. Worth the purchase.
5,It is good for school use including high school but may not be the best choice for a traveling. The texture is rougher than I expected but not in a bad way. Fitting in a few pieces of clothing is okay though.
4,good backpack I love it. I wish it was the color provided in the picture it was a lot brighter
5,My teenager uses it every day and loves it.
5,This backpack is well made high quality functional and the color is beautiful! My son uses it for school so it gets a lot of use and has held up well.
4,I just got this not long ago and it already ripped this sucks I like the color and all but I like to put stiff on the pocket so much for lasting. Thanks for sending a new one like the design now that pocket can come of use
4,I was forced to write this.
3,Got this backpack for the new semester and I really liked it cause it fitted everything that I needed. But I've only had it for two months before the inside (above the interior zip mesh pocket) started to rip and now I have a huge hole that gradually gets bigger. I haven't bought a different backpack yet to replace it cause the bag as a whole is still fine  but I'm disappointed that the inside ripped so quickly.
5,This is the first time I have been compelled to write any type of product review. This a a great backpack. Other packsacks of the same quality that I looked into were double the price. Despite it being advertised as a "lightweight" product it holds my 13in mac three folders one clip board two small text books and two 1 and 1/2 inch binders. Overall I am very pleased with the purchase definitely worth the money!
4,It is a pretty backpack. I use it for school and it really nice. I love the color and my laptop fit perfectly. it is small but i fit 2 binders 2 notebooks and my laptop. so its awesome. love it.
5,It’s a great backpack the fit all the supplies I need. It holds up pretty well too I’ve had it almost five months and it’s gotten no serious damage despite daily use.
5,I bought this bag for my son and it looks really nice. My son really likes it. He uses it as a school bag and it fits his computer books lunch and school supplies. When it first arrived it smelled pretty bad but when we complained they fixed the problem and now we are very happy with it.
5,This is a super good backpack! It will last for a long time! Very nice and has a long of space! It comes with extra things you put on the zipper which is awesome! Over all a 5 love this product!
4,This is a nice simple design but sturdier than most ive experienced in same general category. Overall i like it.
4,Looks great. Didnt realize how slim this item would be. You wont fit alot of things in it unless your items are flat like a tablet and laptop. But looks bery stylish
5,This is the second backpack we bought.  The first one lasted my son two years through high school and just started to wear.  He loved it so much he wanted the exact same one.  Cant go wrong with this backpack!
5,It’s such an affordable backpack and it’s really cute and big for your workbooks and a lot of things to carry for school! I would recommended:)
5,Came a day earlier than expected. Appears to be a good quality. Materials are sturdy & seems to be stitched very well. It passed my husband's "pull test" as he called it. I held both straps & he pulled on the bag no tearing or ripping sounds at all. My husband will be using it for work. I will update in a few weeks for wear & tear results.
5,So cute!! Can't wait to wear to school. There's a little flap protector pocket inside if you're carrying your computer. Good size and the straps are comfy and soft (as can be for a backpack). It seems durable and they provide you with two extra leather pulls for the zipper in case yours break with time. Would purchase this again for sure.
5,Has a nice laptop pocket on the inside and a mesh pocket on the inside. The black really don’t get/look dirty even after use
5,Amazon sent me an email to write a review so I am doing this because I am bored and I need to appear like I am doing work so yeah. Backpack is cool. Looks nice. Not very comfy but I didn't get it because it was comfortable.
5,Good quality
5,I bought this backpack 2 months ago and it still looks brand new. I've used to to travel although I normally use it for school and it's kept my laptop and books dry even while I was caught in light rain! The red is true to color and it's very high quality material. It comes with a backup leather zipper thing and the packaging that it came in was very nice.
5,My daughter needed a new backpack for school. I am confident this one will last longer than her other one which was a different brand.
5,Great back pack for just about anything!  But we bought it for the new school year.  Very well made.  Sturdy material and sewing.  Easy to adjust and use.  Just the right amount of pockets.  Size is perfect for school books and binders.  And it doesn't make the bag extra heavy.  Overall very happy with our purchase.
5,As expected fits all my needs
5,If you're looking for a backpack that's not too small nor too big this is it. I use it to carry daily things like powerbank a few notebooks water bottle etc. So far I really like it. It's very comfortable I like the reinforced bottom and that is water resistant. I got tired of buying cheap $10 backpacks that would just break after 1-2 months of use so this seems like a good investment.
3,I like this bag but there are two reasons why I am returning. 1. I prefer a bigger backpack this one seemed a bit small and came with a bunch of wrinkles. 2. It is cheaper on the company website and I found bigger ones available. Other than that there is not much wrong with it. The bottom is felt-like though and I feel that wouldnt be the best material in the water.
5,This was a gift for my Grandaughter she loves it & said it’s perfect
4,Our middle schooler loves it she’s been using it about three months and so far so good. The bag isn’t too roomy or big but it’s what she wanted.
5,This is the perfect backpack I have had.  It is the right size to carry all my carry on and then some.  The color was the exact color - melon.  I higly recommend it for traveling.  Durable but light weight.
4,Product is nicely made and durable.  It was a little smaller than my daughter expected so she will use it for a secondary bag for sleepovers pool trips and mall shopping.
4,Can't go wrong for the price.
5,I bought this for my daughter who is a freshman in college. Although it is a little bit big for her needs she likes it a lot. And since it's been raining the past few days she says the water repellency is holding up quite nicely so far.
5,I ordered this a week before school startedwhich for me was my first day in College and it arrived on time with a cute thank you note from Vaschy. So far it's been holding up good with the books I carry and is by far the best backpack I've had in terms of quality. Very comfty durable and simply stylish. Highly recommended :)
5,Amazing product. It is 100% waterproof and it has kept my stuff dry for a very long time. I just want to note that I am in high school and I have many binders and heavy textbooks in my bad and one of my backpack straps is starting to tear off. I don't think that is because the backpack is weak it is because of my own personal use.
5,This bag looks really nice & is durable. I’ve used it for a trip to florida as my only bag and it durably held all my stuff. Have also been using for school for almost 4 months and have had no problems. The rubber part that you put your headphones through came off but I’m not worried. Overall great bag
5,Ive been searching for months for a new backpack and after a couple of months of use i have to say this is my favorite backpack ive ever had! Plenty of pocket space padded for protection waterproof and has great durible material not to mention the price!
5,I just received my backpack: it’s just very nice. There’s many pockets inside for books a computer or a tablet everything a student needs to have on his back. I just love it. Highly recommended :)
5,Perfect for hiking and school supplies. Multiple compartments for easy organization
4,The bag has many compartments which is amazing however I don’t like the color so much ..
5,I was looking for a backpack which would be not too large so that I can take it with me everyday while going to work and it should be able to fit all the things which I need. This backpack is perfect for me.
5,My daughter is in love with this backpack!! It is so nice for traveling and for school. Great material and nice color that matches with any clothes! I recommend it!!
5,Second purchase. Same rucksack new color. I loved it the first time and I love it also the second time in new color. Good quality good price and fast delivery. My boys use it for school. They find the rucksacks to be cool and comfortable lots of different pockets for all their stuff fits iPad and/or laptop easily.I just might buy the third one for myself...
5,It's fashionable and strong. My middle schooler has used it for nearly two months now and carries close to 20 pounds of books in it every day. It is holding up very well.
4,I really like this bagPros--cloth materials feel good and not cheap-inside features small netted pocket with zipper + two small slots-it's simple but looks greatCons--zipper feels cheap-I'm 5'11 and it's a little small as are the straps
4,Wonderful style and a couple large compartments. Good value for money.
5,Nice backpack and gets the job done. No complaints.
4,Good buy!
5,Bought this backpack for college and I was a little worried when I saw the size but my two 2in. binders and notebooks fit perfectly! It’s not heavy whatsoever and it doesn’t leave my shoulder aching. I love this backpack and I hope it’ll last me a few more years!
5,i wish it had more pockets and that the water bottle holders were more stretchy. but it holds my three binders folder notebook pencil case and keys/wallet with a good amount of ease. when it rains i haven’t noticed anything inside getting wet. overall it’s a pretty great backpack.
5,I like it it go hard. It's basic and cool its hard
5,I bought this to be my carry on a trip and to use around the city. Well placed pockets inside feets in to the Ryanair size guidelines which i was most worried about. Comfortable pretty just the right size for me and it's really spacious without being bulky.
4,My daughter has been happy with this backpack for school. It fits a small laptop her lunchbag and her notebooks. She was surprised everything fit. She also likes the side pocket to hold her water bottle.
4,Great Backpack! Fast Shipping!
5,Just got this backpack. And I really like it so far. It looks and feels classy. And it's not too big which is exactly why I bought this in the first place.
5,UPDATED REVIEW:  5/5 STARSMy backpack arrived initially with a stitching flaw and the seller was wonderfully cooperative and immediately sent me a replacement which arrived with no flaws.  This is a great backpack for a great price.INITIAL REVIEW:  2/5 STARSThe item arrived with flawed stitching and I am worried it will result in the zipper coming off.
4,Overall great backpack but the zippers can be hard to get to or hard to move sometimes.
5,I bought this for my 6' 5" son and he thought it would be too small. However although this was a smaller backpack he is really enjoying it and doesn't feel like it looks like a kid backpack on his tall self. :)
5,I have been through so many backpacks in my life but this one is the best one I've ever had! I can carry so much more stuff in this and there are a lot of pockets with zippers which help me keep stuff like important papers pens pencils jewelry etc.
5,Bought this to replace a aged backpack with broken zippers.This bag looks small but is extremely spacious. It has numerous compartments in the main opening which makes it ideal to separate things such as clothing textbooks and papers. I use it for college and the gym and have found it to be ideal.
5,This backpack is soooo cute. It also has a ton of storage pockets. I bought a Herschel a few years ago and this one is a million times better! I’m also constantly getting compliments on it. Will purchase again in the future.
1,I wanted to like this. I think it looks really cute I love all the pockets inside and its lightweight. But upon getting it I really don't like it. The inside of the backpack is just too small. Its very narrow from front to back so you can't fit much in here. And for me personally its too small. And the material that this bag is made out of is incredibly stiff and scratchy. So much it makes my shoulders and arms very itchy where they come in contact with the bag. I would give 5 stars for cuteness but for practicallity I give 1 because I cant use it. Will be returning
5,Functional high quality  water resistant  multiple storage compartments  great leather bottom. Perfect for my 3rd Grader and any student/adult.
4,THE MOST I LIKED ABOUT THE BACK PACK WAS THE COLOR. I ACTUALLY GAVE AS A PRESENT WHICH THEY LIKED. SO FAR ITS BEEN GOOD. I'LL SEE WITH A LITTLE MORE TIME. P.VIGIL
4,Great backpack! It gets wet ONLY on the outside and everything stays dry on the inside. Con would be it's not that big for all my school binders/supplies. Overall good bag.
5,i bought this for my brother and he really liked it! i would recommend this product its really cute too
5,There are so many pockets for organization and it is really comfortable on my back. The drink pockets hold my bottle without letting it fall out.
5,My backpack arrived the day after I ordered it! It is excellent quality comes with a reusable bag of the brand extra leather keychain and a ‘thank you’ note. I use this backpack for college and has plenty of room to fit notebooks and other belongings. Thank you for such an affordable product with quality!
5,Perfect size for my 10 year old and the colors are great. She does NOT like any glittery stuff so this is great.Love the pockets inside. Perfect size for traveling and school.
5,The backpack appears resistant; it's not too large. In fact you can only get a limited number of thin foders and binders in it. It will not work for bulky books or binders.
5,I gave it as a Christmas gift to my sister and she likes it. It has a lot of different pockets inside and her computer fits well. The material is thick and the bottom part is made from smth like artificial leather. Looks very nice.
5,I needed a new backpack after a few years and I never had a backpack so convenient. All the pockets it comes with helps me organize all of my stuff. Also a very affordable price too which what makes it so great
5,So far it is great quality and actual brand. No problems whatsoever. I got the maroon/burgundy and it looks great in person. Cannot tell quality over time yet since Ive only had it for a few weeks.There was no bad smell in mine when I received it
5,It's very hard to find a backpack that is comfortable to wear and is stylish as well. However Vaschy will ensure both. My son loves his new backpack and finds going to school more enjoyable. I love how there is a great variety of color to choose from all for a very affordable price. Would definitely recommend to all.
5,Looks cute good amount of pockets can fit my umbrella in the outer side pocket. Slightly annoying that the zipper's decorative tab comes undone pretty frequently so that I have to keep relooping it but you could just leave it off if that's too annoying for you (the decorative tabs are attached to normal zippers). Would buy again.
5,This back pack has lasted me all through college. It’s also legit water proof my stuff has never been wet. It can hold a lot too which is shocking since the price is so cheap I literally jam my bag full of books and heavy things and it’s still fine after 4 years.
5,I've had this for a few months now and it has been very reliable and have encountered no issues so far!Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a relatively small backpack that can fit a lot of school supplies and a laptop.
4,Unfortunately the dark grey I bout gut was not the dark gray I revived. The color did not match at all with the picture description. The gently refound me the money and treat me very good!
5,This backpack is perfect.  It's not enormous perfect size on my back but has plenty of room inside as a gym/pool/day trip bag.
4,Great bag and it is actually water resistant. The only down side in it is that it feels cheap (cheap material) and not so comfortable when you put it on.
5,Good quality and exactly as described in the description. Looks very nice and customer service is brilliant. I never had a seller send a thank you card after buying their product. In fact that is what made me go on here and make my first review. Definitely recommend.
5,This backpack looks great. It is stylish and seems durable. There are so many pockets on the inside which is nice. The color is just as expected. Very happy with this backpack.
4,Great backpack! Loved the product I've had it for 3 days and have gotten tons of compliments :)My only issue is that there were some loose bits of string near the outer pocket. I snipped them off hopefully that wasnt a problem..
5,Nice looking bag but it is a little on the small side compared to a backpack from Jansport etc.  so if you're looking to cart around a lot of books or something maybe go for something bigger. Other than that it's a good looking backpack with good functioning zippers and pockets.
5,Perfect size! I was hoping for this backpack not to be to big and it is not. It is a great size for men and women. It has a lot of pockets perfect to use for school or even hiking. I am very excited about this backpack and will probably order another one for my boyfriend.
5,This bag is definitely waterproof. It’s comfy for school and I can fit everything with the large variety of compartments it has. It was worth every dollar.
5,The backpack strap broke after 6 months of heavy use. Vaschy honored their lifetime warranty and sent me a brand new backpack within a week. Not only did I get a new backpack they are also looking to improve their design so future backpacks are more durable.
5,Works well for me. It has held up perfectly for five months so far and I get a lot of compliments on it! It says it's water resistant but you should take extra precautions with electronics and important papers because it's definitely not water proof.  Overall impressed with the quality for the price.
5,This backpack is exactly what I needed. It's cute and comfortable and it has enough room to comfortably hold all my stuff. Mac book 3 books notebooks computer charger my large wallet and all the little things I take with me all day and enough pockets to keep me organized. Couldn't be happier.
4,Great backpack!  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the smell (kind of a gasoline-type smell).  It is still so strong even after airing out for 2 weeks.
5,Bought this for my daughter who is 10 years old and in 5th grade. It is not humongous on her like I thought it would be.  Love that it is water proof.  The little piece of leather for the zipper has already fallen off but it came with extra.  Overall very happy with my purchase. She has been in school for 25 days so far.
5,This is a cery nice bag. It looks just like the photo and the quility might not be 95% but its at like am 89! Which for the price is really good. I was glad to find out that there was side wayer bottle pockets. I do wish it had penciel slots but thats not a big deal. Great size and great color!
5,Exactly what my teenage son was looking for- perfect for school.
5,It's a very nice backpack and cheap too and their customers service is great! I would 100% recommend you to try their product
5,Great customer service & communication! This company takes pride in their work & it shows! Order from them with full confidence! Thank you Vaschy!!!
5,Not gonna lie I bought it just to match an outfit... BUT I have used it for a lot of things like traveling with a laptop and other things. It’s a good book bag!
4,The leather pieces on the zippers routinely come undone which is annoying. Also the water bottle holders are on the smaller side so they don't fit many of my water bottles. Otherwise backpack is decent quality.
5,what a great book bag and very good Quality for price . Purchased for Key West trip for walking around and going to beach/boat.Held up great will be making it my travel book bag for now on.  came home and bought Kids one for school :-)
5,I have looked for the longest time  for he right backpack for myself. Up to now the bags are way too big. For a 75 year old great grandma myself this is just right. I carry my tablet wallet extra personal items for myself and husband. The outside is very smooth and tailored. Thank you so much.
5,My daughter loves that the bag has extra pockets the bag has and the color but says she doesn't think she can fit a lot of things in the bag.
5,This is a nice backpack that arrived quickly from the seller. All the zippers and closures worked upon receipt. Haven't used it yet but it appears to be well made.
5,simple good quality nice trims and does the job.
4,Definitely a great buy looks simple yet it's very handy and is more than meets the eye. Happy with it great material no problems so far. Interior pockets were a pleasant surprise.
5,Plenty of space for my random tools and things I need at work lunch USB drives pens etc. Feels like a good quality fabric and is holding up great so far.
4,Its everything you need for school or traveling
5,UPDATE: Vaschy sent a new bag no charge to replace our ripped one!!! that was really niceFound a rip in the front of the bag todayNEVER had this problem with a Jansport....unless I had used it for years and years and wore it outA bit disappointed
5,I got a second one for my older son  after I bought the first one for my middle son. It is a great quality lightweight backpack. However you cannot carry heavy stuff there. Otherwise the handles won't survive.
5,Very nice looking backpack decided to finally switch brands and did not regret it the backpack is made from high quality material feel like it would last a long time
5,Very sturdy and roomy backpack for high school
4,very well made but can't hold more than 3 high schools.
5,My 14-year-old son loves this. Says it has lots of zippered areas inside and a hook in the outside pocket for his house key. Was a bit on the smaller side from the school backpacks he usually gets but he thinks it will hold his notebooks just fine. He felt it was a nice sturdy material and will hold up well.
5,The backpack so far is great. I've had it for 20 days and it hasn't given me any problems - given I don't carry heavy textbooks often. Price is pretty reasonable for the product. The backpack seems sturdy it has plenty of pockets for all of my things and my laptop has more than enough space (13 in MacBook pro). I would recommend.
5,I always thought these backpacks looked great I thought they were Patagonia backpacks or something I was really surprised to see them for only $30 on Amazon got this one and have loved it since
5,This is a great backpack for light packers. It's been used twice as a carry-on for short vacations and has done the job very well. Plenty of space for a few days of necessities an iPad or slim laptop and wiggle room for travel purchases. Recommended!
3,I like this backpack. It is on the small side but that's okay because I purchased it to use mainly as a diaper bag. I was very disappointed in the representation of the color. I ordered the red which I expected to be a cranberry color. It is much more purple then the picture depicts. More of a maroon. I ordered for a trip if I had given myself more time I would have returned for a different color.
5,I love it! My backpack arrived in perfect condition and it looks just like in the pictures. It's roomy functional and very comfortable! I can easily fit my 13" laptop. I totally recommend it!PS: The backpack's real color is windsor wine but in my pictures it looks lighter or pink.
5,I already love this bag with my whole heart lol. I gave away all my backpacks and I needed one for classes. I love the color and its built very well I would recommend to anyone to get this bag its worth every penny.
5,I think this bag is a great design and I love how much it can store.  While there was an issue with my bag Vaschy reached out to me and resolved them immediately and offered to send a replacement.  Definitely recommend this company!
5,It is pretty a decent size and has a ton of nifty pockets inside. I plan on using this as my personal item on a flight in a few weeks. The exterior feels durable and the zipper guards make it feel secure. Already recommended to my sister in college if she needs a new bag! Highly recommend.
5,I got this bag today and so far I am really satisfied with the product. It looks amazing and the quality is also great with the respect to price. Overall this is a great backpack for students and it can also fit 15' laptops which is also a plus.
4,This fits my daughter’s Chromebook for school however the bag was a lot thinner than we expected for a book bag.
5,Good quality. Spilled coffee by the corner of the bag and it didn’t stain.
5,Not so many bells and whistles but as a way to protect my work laptop and carry my paperwork to and from the office it's functional and good looking.
5,I love the color and many storage options for this backpack. I've got caught in the rain a few times since I started using it and it appears to be quite water resistant. Only thing I'm not sure about is how well the laptop section will fit my laptop. I haven't tried it yet to be sure.
5,Good quality. Had a tear in it but got a replacement in a few days free of charge though the Vaschy 1 year warranty
5,I always have trouble finding a backpack that isn't too big on me. I'm 5'1 and every backpack I ever get makes me look like a turtle besides this one. It is the perfect size for me and is well made.
5,I use this for school and like it.
4,Good product as described
5,For my grandson school work
5,Nothing to dislike about this product I’ve actually bought two of these. Everyone I know is using this brand and for good reason it’s very good quality.
5,My sons love this backpack it is stylish and sturdy.  It has gotten wet several times and the contents stayed dry.  Highly recommend!
5,Love this product! I've been using it almost a year now and is still holding up very well. I use it every day for school work and as a carry on when I travel.
4,It looks great only downside it always drags the back of my shirt up it's gets a bit annoying lucky I only got class 3 days a week.
5,Based on what I've seen so far this is a good product. It has a warranty has a lot of space and the material is strong and durable.
4,It’s a Christmas gift 🎁! I’ll give it five stars when my relative receives and likes it  ! Thanks for getting it out so fast !
5,This was a Christmas gift for my 12 yr. old Grandaughter. She was delighted when she opened it and when school resumed I asked her how she liked her backpack. She said it was "perfect" because it was the right size for her and she loved the style.
5,Has multiple zipper sections inside the bag. My laptop fits perfectly in there. The material of the bag feels nice and sturdy. Looks like it will last a couple years compared to my previous bag.
3,My laptop doesn't fit in the slot and one of the straps is tearing off despite only a max 20 pound load for about 3 weeks of school. I like the bag and it fits what I need but it's kind of low quality. My laptop is just a hair too wide for the laptop sleeve which annoys me because I measured it to make sure that it would fit before I purchased the bag. Ah oh well it fits in the bag.
5,Great bag for school. Just doesn't offer a big capacity if that is what you are looking for.
5,loved the way it looked exactly like the photo and it was the perfect size and had great organization pockets for all your stuff. It was a high quality material.
5,I use this bag as my purse and I love it!! I carry a lot of medicines a planner my lunch my beats glasses makeup just A TON of stuff and there’s pockets for EVERYTHING! It’s the perfect “Adult backpack”.
5,Great amount of storage! I have found about five extra pockets I didn’t know where there after purchase
5,This is the perfect backpack. The inside is filled with easy organizing pockets and pouches perfect for my trip abroad. LOVE this bag so much! Great quality!!
5,Lots of pockets and room decent size my laptop fits along with extra space for other things etc.
5,Great product my daughter has used this for at least a year and its still going. She carries everything in it heavy books and supplies for school and overnight stays. Great buy!
5,Really good backpack. Looks like a Herschel bag from afar but there's no need to spend money on a Herschel bag when this backpack is an option! I use it for school and will carry heavy textbooks and my laptop and wear it in the rain etc. and I haven't had any rips or damage. Great backpack
5,Delivered on time & no damages or anything ✅ Very sufficient sized bag perfect for my senior year of hs. Some people complain about a strong scent but honestly it's not bad at all it smells like a new bag (just like the ones you'd buy at a store). Overall 10/10 !
3,I got this back pack for my brother he is in high school so maybe this sint the best use for people who have a lot of books to ccarry I thought it would be a little bigger UT it's quality material the bottoms are thick and padded so no rips or tares only issue what the size if ur carrying a laptop and maybe one 500 page text book fit and some more small items that's out it
5,I bought this for my 9 year old grandson who wanted a plain backpack this year. He liked the color and size & I liked the style durability and of course the price so we were both happy!!
5,Bought for my 13 yr old daughter for 8th grade. She really likes how much it holds lil compartments and durability. I’m very satisfied.
3,Ordered this packback on accident. Was planning on ordering a Herschel’s but didn’t pay attention to my search. It’s a nice packback my son doesn’t mind it and would rather keep than return. I gave it three stars because it has a odd factory smell. Letting it air out and hopefully that will work. We are also planing on covering up the “vaschy” patch.
5,Cute backpack with plenty of pockets and room. Very durable but not heavy  material so it didn't add to the weight of my books. It smells when it first comes out of the package so let it air out for a few days. Love it and would recommend!
5,They were a gift for my grand daughters so I CAN'T tell you much about their longevity but I can say they seem to be well made with nice convenient pockets quality and I picked bright colors for then so that they could be visible from a long way off
4,Perfect backpack for lugging around a few items. Small laptop charger and few books. Lightweight and sturdy.
4,Overall the backpack is nice love the pockets inside the main compartment. As well as the extra zipper pulls as I can see then falling off eventually. The price point is great.
5,Excellent Backpack that has numerous pockets while still remaining comfortable and not bulky. One thing I do not really enjoy is having 2 side pockets for waterbotttles I would have preferred just one. But it comes with a warranty and a very lovely and helpful company. I would highly recommend it.
5,Heavy duty well made clean cut looks good and easy to carry. I have no complaints. This thing keeps me organized and I see many years of use coming from it. I am glad I got on the waitlist to purchase this (it was out of stock when I ordered).
5,This backpack is very durable has many compartments and very nice. I love all the color choices. It’s also very comfortable and holds everything very well. It’s easy to carry and is quality made. Overall great product for the price. Highly recommend
4,The backpack's material feels and looks amazing; however the product would've made me give a five-star review if it was a bit larger.
3,I bought this bag because I loved the color. It's pretty good quality on the outside anyway. The inside (the stitching in the main compartment) came undone really easily though. I wasn't rough with the bag at all I used it primarily to carry my apron and work short to and from work. There really was no reason that the outside looked perfect but the inside was coming apart.
5,Bought for college and it’s perfect. Big pocket has a a stretch pocket within it that’s perfect for my iPad or laptop. Good looking and feels good after wearing for hours on end.
5,I bought this for my son and he loves it. He is able to fit all his books and p.e clothes. I would buy this again if this one wears out
5,Very good water proof I carried it when it rained and all my papers were dry. Used this for over a year now and it’s still good as new!
5,It’s perfect for our daughters needs
5,I had bought this backpack awhile back and a couple months ago I noticed that the inside had started to tear so Vaschy was amazing and sent me a replacement backpack free of charge.  This is an awesome company and really strives to satisfy their customers.  I love this backpack!
5,I’ve obsessed with this backpack. It holds a lot of stuff! I’m a full time college student and it’s beyond what I imagined it would be the best backpack I’ve owned so far.
5,I bought this for my senior year in high school and it turned out be just as good as I expected it.It looks very classy and you can fit your stuff really well.Definitely recommended!
5,This is the perfect backpack for males and females and anyone that is looking for backpacks
3,I liked the many pockets and storage options available as well as size. My complaint is that it ripped within a few months of purchase in multiple spots when only using a few days a week at work
4,It's a nice backpack.
5,Doctor told me to start walking moreso this is my new grocery bag!New boots and a backpack in one orderhere I come grocery store!Didnt need all the attachments students needjust a comfy well made pack!
5,This is a really good bag and it’s perfect for making it your backpack at school.
5,My son is happy with the product and to wear it back to school.  It appears roomy and a great size for his freshman year.
5,Perfect for fitting all of my school books. Very good quality and looks just like the photo
5,This is a very nice sturdy backpack I used it as my personal bag in an airplane trip. IIt doesn't look big but I could fit a pair of boots a 6 x 4 plastic case my purse a book electronicsand a water bottle in the outside pocket. And it fit under the front seat!
5,Good backpack no smell or anything though some other reviews said there was a smell. Inside has neat dividing things and pockets for all the miscellaneous items. Comfortable and sturdy.
5,Very great back pack. I am in college and this carries everything I need it to. its a great size
5,This thing held up very well for my girlfriend. She loved the color and style but is now realizing it isn't quite big enough so time to move on. Great buy though
5,My son loves this backpack! He’s 5 but can use it for a while.
4,It is sturdy and versatile.
5,Got this as a work backpack. I like that there are multiple sleeves on the inside and that it is a smaller backpack. Only downside is that the water bottle holder on the outside is a little on the small side.
5,My son uses this for school. It had held up well and was exactly as pictured. Very pleased.
5,LOVED. It is lightweight and my son loved it. Had to air it out in the garage all summer before school and put a little perfume on it. The plastic was just a bit too smelly for us. Nevertheless it cleared all up and was perfect.
5,Excellent quality and appearance. We really like the durable bottom and it’s water resistant. Perfect for high school and college students. I highly recommend.
5,Muy buena calidad y lindo
5,Excellent product / my husband loves it it was his Christmas 🎁 gift
5,I love all the pockets! This bag is a great size and has tons of pockets for everything you might need. The extra leather tags were a really nice add on. The backpack shipped fast and looks great!
2,Although I liked this backpack as a budget option for awhile it broke too soon for my liking. It had okay waterproofing and was generally roomy enough to hold my 13inch Macbook Pro chargers and school books. However the zipper started breaking within 8-9 months and was unusable by the 10th month. It's in the garbage now and I went back to using my old Steve Madden - I would spend more money investing in something that lasts longer.
2,I love this backpack. It has a ton of great pockets-- especially the mesh one on the inside. It is comfortable to wear holds a ton of stuff and is easy to organize. However I've had it for a few months and it has not worn well at all. The side where the side pocket meets the bag is completely ripping sometimes causing things to fall out. It got a little wet and the stain on the front pocket has not gone away. While it is a great bag and I would buy another one for its style color and functionally my bag has completely fallen apart in the few months that I have owned. it
5,Great backpack
5,Love: the color the style the compartments water resistancyDont love: the zipper tagsUpdate: the bag ripped on the top inside but the customer service representative was very nice and quick to respond they sent me a new backpack in 2 days! Great customer service!
5,Arrived fast and exactly what I needed
5,Met my expectations
4,I like the functionalities of the bag. Although when it's in a dimmer light it looks green...I don't know what that's about but oh well.(I got gray)
5,Great customer service. Very responsive and it is a great bag to travel with and for everyday.
4,Clean look. Great for guys/girls. Seems durable enough (haven't used yet). A tad bit larger than your average laptop. NOT for regular backpack needs (textbooks etc.)
5,Awesome quality i'm a guy and i look amazing with it. I cant get over the packaging they send you a thank you card. I was kinda on the edge when buying it but it is strong simple and it has quite a bit of compartments
5,Exactly what I was looking for. A simple quality backpack for work (I work as a nurse). Has plenty of functional pockets and separators inside without overdoing it. Does have that "new bag" smell but I imagine it will go away with time.
5,I do not usually use backpacks. But I was taking a trip and needed a way to bring my laptop and a few things on the airplane. A friend suggested a backpack. This item is the right size and worked well for me.
5,The customer service was amazing and they sent multiple emails keeping me updated about the product. The backpack was perfect size and very good quality. It looked just like the color on the screen and was definitely large enough for all my textbooks and laptop.
4,very stylish but a little small for books carry binders and lunch that is all.
5,This backpack is great! It feels super comfortable on your back and the straps are nice and cushy. It has a lot of pockets which is great to me because I keep pencils and and phone and wallet in it and it is very convenient and accessible.
5,Freaking awesome back pack. Way better price and quality than Jansport. I'm in a wheelchair she it fits perfectly on their. I'm also pretty rough on Backpacks and this thing is holding up fantastic after a few months
5,This is going to be used by my daughter for college.
5,Very spacious and durable. Good for travel. Fit my laptop and my (handheld) switch among other items.
5,Bought this for my son.  Not sure on how durable it is but we will find out he always carries tons of books.
5,This was purchased as a gift for my working son.  He loves it.  Holds everything he has to carry everyday.  Thank you.
5,I got this backpack for school and it’s amazing! Perfect amount of space. I love all the different compartments it has helps keep everything organized.(:
5,I got this bag in the mail today for my daughter. I am so please with it that I am thinking about getting one for myself. It's a beautiful maroon color with real leather. It came with extra leather tassels too. The bag seems pretty heavy duty which is great also. I'd highly recommend this to anyone
5,Product arrived on time and just as described. Bought as a gift and they loved the yellow color. Great price for school bag.
4,I love the bag but I though it would be bigger. still works though!
2,I started out loving this backpack! I've had it for a few months and it has worked very well up until a few weeks ago. The stitching on one of the straps is coming undone and has left a hole in the backpack. Additionally I'm afraid that the sticking will continue to come undone and the strap will come off completely. I have had to switch back to my old back pack out of fear that this will happen while I'm walking to class or something. Disappointed that this didn't hold up longer! I was looking forward to using it for a long time.
5,Es resistente
5,Great storage lots of room definitely recommend
5,Been using it since school started and it's held up very nicely. Looks exactly the same in person as online. Plenty of space for a high schoolers books and folders and no bigger than 15 inch laptop lots of pockets. Honestly can't think of anything bad about this item.
5,This back pack was exactly as described. It has more room than it seemed and my daughter's large school binder fits perfectly!
3,I've had it less than two months and the fabric inside is already ripping out. I am updating my review to say that they sent me a new one free of charge and upheld the warranty so that is nice!
5,Great value reliable simple backpack for everyday use. Very happy with the quality especially considering the price. Just as good in terms of wear and tear as the Northface backpack I had before.
5,its good quality. has nice organizers. but its a little on the smaller side for backpacks. if you are carrying textbooks binders etc. in it then this bag is not for you.
5,The backpack is surprisingly great. Had more than enough space for my notebooks and such (I'm a high school student btw) but just don't be surprised if you cannot carry a bunch of textbooks in it. For the looks and for the price I totally find this backpack worth it.
5,My daughter loves this backpack. Sure it doesn't look very special but the padding and interior pocket are perfect for her 13" Mac that she transports inside a hard-shell and soft neoprene case. Seems well built for the money.
5,Really great backpack! Heavy duty and feels like it will last. Great color and feel. Nice deep pockets and with a water bottle holder!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             i love that there are lots of inside compartments to keep your things organized.. great quality and has a 1 year warranty
4,Nice size and good looking backpack. I bought this for my commute to work and it seems to be holding up great!
4,Satisfied
5,i have a love for 2 strap bags and this remind me so much of the herschel brand bags and was alot cheaper. it is very clean and sturdy even if it should get wet. i would recommed this bag for anyone.
5,Great for everyday use. Reliable and somehow always feels light even when completely full. Water resistant is a nice touch
5,Lots of pockets
5,Great bookbag for college students! Very water resistant and nice style.
5,This school backpack is great. It has a lot of pockets on it and it has pockets inside pockets. It works great for all of the school binders that have to fit inside the backpack.
5,Great backpack - received within a few days (much faster than the expected shipping window) and generally very good quality especially for the price. It's obviously somewhat of a knockoff Herschel but I actually prefer this to Herschels as it has a lot more internal pockets.
5,I love this backpack it is very lightweight has lots of storage slots and is comfortable to carry. Great product.
5,My kid loves this backpack!  Just enough pockets and space.  No more digging through 5 pockets to find a pen.
5,Backpack came in flawless shape. Use it casually for class from time to time and serves me perfect since I don’t take much with me on the go plus it’s matces most of my outfits I wear. Happily purchased.
5,Amazon has so many choices and good products. I also like the quick deliver service.
5,I was worried that it might be to small for an adult but it's a decent size.
5,Bought for my 15 yr old grandson. His response was perfect size looks great and the leather bottom made it even look better. He’s very happy and satisfied with this backpack.
5,Love the back pack really nice quality. Thank you very much for putting the time and effort to make such an amazing back pack. I'm using this backpack for college and I recommend it to everyone reading this 5 stars.
5,Great backack. i am using it at this conference i am at. Everything fits perfect and easy to carry.  so bad i bought it
5,I bought this backpack to replace my old one which was worn out. Nice size and very good quality.
5,Smallish but that's exactly what I wanted. Its minimal looking with a nice touch of design
4,Good purchase
4,4 stars because the little tabs on the zippers keep coming undone
5,Purchased this for my high school age son to use as his daily backpack. It is working out grest so far!
4,It's exactly like the description and te reviews really helped the bottom isn't leather more like sand paper but a bit smaller
5,Bought for my daughter to use for 1st grade. Made of durable material. Zippers are easy to operate.
4,Love this backpack. Love the color. Even came with a little thank you note and vaschy plastic bag. I love it!!
4,This is a great backpack for the cost! So many compartments and still maintains a non-bulky appearance. I love it!
5,I ordered the second backpack in a different color because my wife wanted one of her own. Just the right size with a lot of compartments to keep things organized.
3,Does everything that everyone else has mentioned EXCEPT the waterproof aspect. Waterproof and Water Resistant are two completely different things. Walked about 5 minutes from my car to my class and the water had soaked through the lining and hit my laptop. Had I not had a sleeve on my laptop my laptop would've have Cotten completely soaked. Aside from that the pack is good.
5,This is the perfect backpack for my daughter.  She has been looking at new backpacks for weeks.  She finally was so excited to find this one in her favorite color!
5,Awesome backpack. It is made of good materials very simplistic and has so many pockets for you to put things in. Highly highly recommend for students in high school and college.
5,Completely satisfied with this backpack intuitive and convenient design. I just wish there was an additional pouch within the main compartment for a bulky charger. Overall very well satisfied :^)
5,I like the backpack but i've only had it for 2 days a lot of room and pockets. I like the laptop sleeve in there.
2,Update:  replacement backpack has broken already.  I'm only giving two stars for customer service. I will not ask for a second replacement.I purchased this bag for my son for school this year.  The first bag lasted a little over a month before the strap broke. BUT the seller was very quick to replace the bag. I believe the broken strap was a fluke as there are so many good reviews. The bag has a lot of storage and is comfortable.
4,All in all does the job nothing to fancy
3,You get what you pay for..it served its purpose for 6 months but then ripped. Never used it for excessively heavy things just a laptop and a notebook.
5,Product came on time and was exactly what we wanted.
5,Great product great quality (like really!) and great price. Recommended!
5,Bought this one for a Mexico trip well made and had plenty of storage for our needs.
4,Good quality but I wished it was larger.
5,I like the size of it only enough space for to store important things i need for work.
5,I bought this for my granddaughter.  She loves the way the backpack opens so generously and she can easily get all of her notebooks books and folders inside.  She appreciates the tailored good looks too.
3,It's a good backpack but it's not tough. I used it to go to school and sewing opened in the pocket from inside and the handle of putting on the shoulder is loosening. So if you carry a weight like a notebook and a computer like me this backpack wouldn't work.
4,I've only been using it for 3 days so far i like it! came with a strange smell though
4,Smaller than I thought it would be and it smelled kind of weird. Otherwise a decent purchase.
5,Love this backpack using it for college and just on the go to work and other places
5,bought this as a cheap alternative to a hershel bag however this bag is in my opinion all around better. especially at this price point. 10/10 would buy again
5,There are so Many pocketS inside. very convinent. I wonot feel tired aftering long term loading. Beside It lookS very low-key and very easy to match clothes
4,Has a small to itBut great quality
5,Love how comfortable it is. Makes it sooooooo easy to organize. I feel they really took the time to understand what is needed in a backpack and how to make it easier for carriers to look for items.
4,I absolutely love this bag! And it came just in time for me to start my school year !!
5,This backpack is being used for school.  It is easy to travel with and space capacity is great!
5,Backpack is well-made material. It can hold all of my books. The color is accurate to the picture. There are tons of storage pockets. Waterbottle pockets fit up to 3" diameter. I really like this product and it was exactly what I expected.
4,This backpack is a beautiful color and overall very aesthetically pleasing. Zippers open and close with no proble. The material feels like nice quality.
5,It is great I use it for school and it fits everything
4,It works as intended
5,My 7 year old loves pink and teal. She loves this bag and carries it everyday to school
5,I love this bag. I brought it for my boyfriend and he carries it everywhere. He’s able to fit so much in there

5,So far this book bag looks strong. I purchased this bag for my son for school in September so I will update my review then. The delivery was fast.
5,Bought this for my High School daughter and she loves it! Very spacious sturdy and convenient.
5,Ive had this backpack for about a week and so far its great. lightweight but durable enough to carry all of my materials to class. No Complaints!
5,This backpack has plenty of pockets and spaces for storage. It's smaller but holds a lot more than you think and still looks good.
5,Product is compact enough that it’s easy to take with you - while still having space for the notepad folders and laptop I carry with me.
5,Es muy práctica amplio y se siente de muy buena calidad
2,I bought this backpack for the spring semester I really liked the different compartments and how light it felt. I usually only carry my laptop notebook calculator and my pens/pencils in the inside pocket. But after only a month of usage I noticed the top part has ripped... And I am very careful with my backpack I don't overstuff it or force is to close. Also the little leather tags on the zippers are cute but they tend to fall off easily.  Overall cute backpack but quality could be better.
5,I have got this for school and I am very pleased with it.
5,It was a gift for my college student daughter.
5,My son is super happy with this bag it's not huge but it holds his laptop notebook and his pens and pencils just fine. It's been a month+ and it seems to be holding up really well.
5,Would buy again 100 times. Beautiful bag. So many pockets. I have gotten so many compliments on this back pack since i bought it 2 months ago and it still looks brand new
5,This backpack is sturdy and spacious.
5,Exactly what you pay for no complaints whatsoever. Had it for about a year and it's still holding up

5,You can fit a lot of stuff in it and still no loosing its square shape
4,zipper broke very quickly...
5,Simple and fit all my stuff for school.

5,So basic and easy! Just shove my binders in this backpack with my laptop and it’s perfect to lug around for school. Would recommend getting.
5,Beautiful bag as described will wear in perfectly! It can fit a macbook pro at most i believe (14 inch) and has many compartments for  such a small bag! I love it so far!!

5,Great backpack. Daughter uses it at College and loves it.

5,Perfect size if u don’t want a heavy back pack
5,This is the coolest back pack I have ever owned. The leather is soft and the straps are padded effectively for comfort. Plenty of pouches to put whatever you need inside!
4,Had it for 5 months and has one lose stitching. Can be easily repaired...but overall great color and durable for college.
5,Looks the same as in the photos great quality.
5,It isn't the backpack with the most room. But gosh damn this backpack should definitely be enough

2,At first I really enjoyed the way this product look! It has plenty of pockets and the bag fit nicely on my shoulders. However after just a couple days of use a zipper got stuck.

2,Bought for my 1st grade son for school. It’s perfect size washes amazing and very sleek. I bought this in black last year for my other son and was so happy with it ordered it again for next one. However this time the zipper broke and wasn’t closing properly 3 months into using it. Not happy that for this price the bag didn’t last a full season.
5,This is a very nice pack; heavy-duty plenty of space zippered compartments. Looks like old-fashioned canvas with leather zipper pulls. Even included extra pulls. Amazing product for the money.
5,Incredibly roomie and perfect for carrying a lot of stuff in. Comfortable too doesn't hurt my back or shoulders like most backpacks do
1,I needed a simple yet durable backpack that I could lug around campus. I don't carry a lot with me just a few notebooks my laptop and occasionally a book. The first school morning that I was going to use it I put all my stuff in was ready to close up the backpack and came to realize that both the zippers broke. Not just one zipper; BOTH. Until I could find a new pack I had to walk around campus clutching this like a purse. Save your money and don't buy this heaping pile of trash.

5,It looks even better than its photo. Very high quality. Just the right storage spaces. Best pack back I have ever owned.
5,Love this bag! Great size nice pockets. I am taking this to Iceland so I will report back on the water resistance.
5,Cute backpack it is not large. Bag did have a strong chemical smell to it but it went away
1,I bought the bag in Burgundy. It looks very sleek and the material of the bag is of a good quality. However the zips get stuck and the faux leather tags on the zips are badly made - too short and keep un-tying. One has to be careful when zipping or unzipping lest the cute looking tag comes apart. The bag comes with two extra of these tags so the company is aware of the flimsiness of this design. A bagpack should provide easy access to one's things and I didnt find this to be the case. Im returning the item as I write.
5,Jansport-quality fabric with plenty of pockets and stash spots. Kid loves it!

3,I didn't read the fine print well enough. Barely holds anything!
5,Great size great colour and super sturdy! Love it!

5,It nice and resitstant.
5,This one is perfect. I think I will own one for my daughter as well!
5,Better than I expected!
5,It is a little small but I like it a lot
2,I purchased it in February and it is ripping in the inside front pocket already only 4 months later. I really love the backpack but the rip is causing issues with using it. On top of that there is supposed to be a replacement warranty but there are no instructions on how to work with Amazon or with Vaschy.
5,Love it all
5,My daughter loves this - not too big not too small. Good quality
5,very sturdy and great quality thick material and durable.
5,Great well made pack!

5,My son loves this backpack!
5,I feel like Dora with this
2,This was a great backpack at first but the seams attaching the straps to the top of the backpack have proven to be really weak. I only kept a laptop and a 3-subject notebook in the backpack and within just 3 months one of the straps was almost completely detached. I wish this backpack had help up longer because the fabric itself is high-quality and it was aesthetically pleasing.
5,I love it. It fits everything I have in there
5,Holds all my stuff lots of compartment to put things in and can carry all my textbooks
5,X
5,Great backpack!! so many little pockets within and it's very light.

5,I love this backpack it’s totally worth the buy!
2,My daughter was very hopeful to try this backpack but a part inside the backpack broke in less than a month.. sad because my daughter really liked the backpack because of all the pockets inside and out but didn’t want to take a chance.

1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FLIMSY PRODUCT!!!! After a couple of weeks of regular use the shoulder strap ripped a large hole right through the bag. Making the bag useless . After contacting the company for months there has been no response back to me and I haven’t been provided with a refund or a new bag. I’m disappointed in the customer service given and further urge you not to buy bags from this company.

5,Great product. Very good and solid quality! Love love!
1,Delivered October 28th handle ripped November 24th. I'm surprised because they stress high quality details but perhaps I just got a bad bag? I've been using it daily carrying my ipad water bottle and either my camera or some clothing. Not sure how or why it ripped as I didn't handle it roughly at all. I will need to purchase a new bag thus the one star.
2,This would be a great back pack if it wasn’t for the  horrendous smell.  I have washed it 4 times varying from oxyclean and gentle care bleach. It still smells.....  I wouldn’t buy this again based on the smell
5,way better than a thought it would be awesome value
5,FANTASTIC Back pack - Durable and cool looking.  Great pockets!
5,A little small for me but i love it !
1,Warning! Do not get the bottom brown suede part wet or place it on anything lighter than the brown part! I recently went to the beach and place the bag on top of my favorite beach towel. When I lifted my bag up there were brown stains on the towel. I immediately went home to wash my towel and the stains will not come off! Very disappointed and upset that my favorite each towel has ugly brown marks on it. I would recommend some cleaning before use.
5,daughter wanted it
5,Great for putting pins on and traveling!

5,My daughter loves it.
2,I bought it in April and it broke in June (two months) the vashy logo already came off and one of the arm straps is ripping already so I would say to spend more money for a better quality backpack. I like the design though.
5,Lots of inside pockets which is handy in my opinion.
2,Been using it for a few months and hand been likeibg it so far. However if the bag gets heavy the stitching for the straps comes off slowly was kinda expecting better quality cause of all the reviews but guess not.
5,love it! so much room a lot of pockets/zippers. holds a lot

5,This backpack is p rad🔥✨
2,On the outside this backpack is durable but on the inside it is not. After just one year of regular use the inner seams are falling apart.Considering the mid-range cost of this backpack the seams should of held together longer.
5,Awesome
5,Excellent condition.  Exactly what I was looking for.
5,GREAT. GREAT. GREAT. I use this backpack everyday. I adore it
1,If you are looking for a small book bag that can not carry many books this is the bag for you. I wish I hadn’t bought this bag. It’s a joke for a full-time college student. I can’t bring any textbooks to school. I’ve decided to go back on the hunt for a new bag that fits the majority of my books (at least one of them lol).
5,My son really loved it....and it is very sturdy

5,Good
1,Quality wise this looks great. Sharp strong and sturdy. But the bag smells like it was dipped I gasoline. We have tried airing it out and the smell is still there. It makes the entire room smell like fumes. I'm very disappointed. I don't know if this is just the bag I received or if they all smell like fumes. So beware when you buy it.
5,Great! Well made and looks just like picture!
5,Bought this for my sonhe loves it!
5,Sturdy and nice size.
1,Looking at this it looks like a normal sized backpack but when you receive it it looks like its for a kindergartner. I'm only 510 this backpack barely covers half my back this is really annoying that they say its hand measured so size will vary. I will never buy I backpack from a company that says that from now on.
5,Works well very handy comfortable
5,Lap top feels safe and material feels durable
5,Bought as a gift and they loved it !
5,Perfect!
5,Love this back  pack!!
5,It's comfortable and beautiful.
2,Not a bad backpack looks quite nice and fits everything fine. For some reason the bottom/back of the backpack catches the fabric of your shirt and pulls it up. Very annoying

2,The strap was extremely long. I wish it was more noticeable on the pictures
2,Fabric ripped and zipper broken after 1 month
2,It looks similar but I think the fabric is slightly different and it ripped less than 2 months. I'm pretty sure not buying from this again.
5,HE LOVES IT!!
1,Although this bag looks good and has good packaging it is not waterproof. earlier I put some paper in it and walked in the rain. now all the paper is partially wet. I live in seattle and that's part of the reason I bought the bag; it rains a lot. Now the bag is totally useless because maybe it is water resistant but not water proof.
5,excelent!
5,Very happy with this!
5,good
5,It's great!
1,Para mi hija lo usa para el colegio
1,While my daughter liked the look and way that this backpack was set up.  She is now unhappy because it is falling apart the zipper doesn't work and it is coming apart at the seams. Terrible purchase.
5,Nice bag
5,Great backpack!
1,very small capacity
4,I think VASCHY is selling themselves short by calling this a "classic lightweight" backpack. There are tons of extras I wouldn't expect in a "classic" backpack and this is a very sturdy well-made backpack - not what I would call "lightweight."I got the blue pack. It's attractive made of a heavy-duty polyester material. It holds its shape well but isn't rough to the touch. It is lined (almost totally) with heavy-weight black nylon.The seams are finished inside. The zippers are heavy-duty and the outer ones have leather pulls (two extra pulls are even included with the pack). The bottom of the pack is covered with a faux suede material as protection against dirt or whatever you might set your pack on. This is another nice touch that you usually don't see on packs in this price range.The center large compartment has a zippered pouch on the back above where the laptop compartment is. The back of the pack is very nicely padded as protection for your electronic devices. The laptop compartment is big enough for a 15" laptop. I am using it for my iPad 4 and for my Kindle Fire HDX both of which are in heavy-duty cases and both fit into the laptop compartment at the same time with no problem.Still in the center compartment on the front side is a mesh zippered pouch - for keys in my case. Below this pouch are two slots made from the nylon material which will hold your phone and your iPod. Above one of the slots in the top of the pack is a rubberized wire port to run your earbuds or headphone wires through. Nice touch.NOTE: These two slots are one of the problems I have with the pack. They were made by sewing a nylon square onto the inner wall of the pack and sewing a line down the middle to separate them. There is no reinforcement to the edges of these slots and - if people use them for their phone especially - they will get a lot of use. I was very surprised after seeing the quality of the rest of the pack just how subpar these slots were.The rest of the center compartment is open space - for books gym clothes or shoes or whatever you need it for. There's a lot of space in there.On either side of the outside of the pack are slots for water bottles (or umbrellas). And they are actually good sized so a water bottle will fit in them.On the front of the pack is a zippered compartment with the zipper hidden. One side of the inner compartment is lined and the other is the polyester that the pack is made from.NOTE:I feel that both sides of this compartment should have been lined - if you're going to line one you should line the other. Plus the sewing was shoddy in this compartment. The lining was loose at the bottom and not sewn down. That will allow small items to get up between the lining and the pack and get lost.The front compartment has a single heavy-duty zipper with a leather pull and the center compartment of the pack has dual heavy-duty zippers both with leather pulls.Sewn on the front compartment of the pack is a white tag that measures 1 3/4" wide x 1 7/16" tall. Written on the tag is:Care to QualityVaschySIMPLE AND NEATOn the back of the pack are heavily padded shoulder straps with heavy-duty plastic buckles that have plenty of room for adjustment. They are 2 1/4" wide and very comfortable. There is also a black hang strap at the top of the pack.My measurements of the pack I received are:17" tall x 14" wide x 5 5/8" thick.Other than the couple small things I mentioned I find this to be a very durable well-made backpack especially for the price ($25.99 today). I think it will last through a lot of abuse and it's attractive too.I am very glad that I received this backpack in exchange for my unbiased review.
5,Great quality!
5,Everything fine
1,Way too small for high school. I would recommend this for traveling but I would not recommend for school purposes especially high school. You can barely fit a binder and one textbook in here.
1,This bag smells awful.  It appears to be well constructed and has lots of useful compartments but the smell is intolerable.  I'm planning to return this bag simply because of the strong chemical odor which has persisted after several days devoted to airing it out.
5,Excelent purchase
2,It's a knock off of Herschel (which is fine) but it smelled awful like bad chemicals.
1,This product is poorly made and after less than 3 weeks of use the bag started to tear where the strap meets the bag and where the handle meets the bag. I was excited for this product but am super disappointed with the quality and durability of the bag.
2,To small. For a high school
1,Hi my name is Carolina and my daughter  recently bought the backpack from this brand and after a week of using the bag the zipper broke from both sides. I would like to change it how can I do?
2,The chemical smell is overwhelming.  Entire house smells for days after opening package.
1,Bought this a year and a half ago and already need to throw it out.
1,Straps a re ripping after 2 months of use and return window closed!
1,product ripped if you put too many clothes in it and couldn't really stretch much to fit anything beyond like a book and an ipad.
1,Bought last year. Strap is broken not happy. Only used for school. Had his other old one for 4 years.
1,Zipper kept catching.  Trying to open it up the bag ripped easily and I do not recommend anyone to buy this bag.  Seems like a good bag but the quality of the zipper is poor.
1,I feel like a FOOL - So deceiving. I thought I was purchasing a Herschel backpack. Not the bootleg version. I would like a refund
1,Great looking bag but it smells like moth balls. Aired it out for a week now and it still smells the same. Worse part is it stunk up my car and office.
1,This product is not water resistance and not exactly the same as shown in pics!
1,Ripped!!! Only used two days!
1,Bought thinking it was Herschel. Copy cats...
1,Very cheaply made and will not hold up for the semester let alone a year. I refuse to pay to have this junk sent back
1,What a piece of crap!! Such bad quality and sooooo TINY! Ughhh it barely fits my MacBook Air. Was not expecting this.
1,It has a one year warranty. I purchased mine January 2018. The zipper got stuck and broke how do I get my replacement or money back?!
1,I bought this backpack as a gift in June my friend didn’t begin using it until August and both zippers broke in September. It was a nice backpack.
1,I’ve had this for about 10 days and it still reaks if gasoline. The odor is making me nauseous. Very disappointed and will be returning
1,DO NOT BUY! It is a knockoff. The real brand is vans. This is made from cheap materials and not nearly as good as the real product!
1,I bought this bag for my son to use for school. After one week the strap ripped off. It looks nice but very poor quality.
1,Strap came loose from the backpack after 1 week light use.  taking it to be repaired. seam opened.not pleased.
1,I ordered this for my high school son and it was more like for a child!
1,It sucks it already has a hole
1,Came with a rip
1,Strap broke within months and the inside pocket tore shortly after
1,Seemed like a good deal but after 1 month of school it broke!
1,Not ideal for high school I keep having to sew the strap on
1,Great
1,It ripped in two months. Did not hold up to a teenager who carries only a laptop.
1,Worst quality
1,Buyer beware: Knock-off of name brand Herschel bags. This is not a Herschel bag it's an imitation.
1,Some of the stitching is already coming off. I’ve used it for only a week.
1,After only two months of use the side pocket has ripped off of this backpack. Very disappointed.
1,Horrible! My strap ripped off after only 4 months of use.
1,Said it was waterproof and on a rainy day the bag gets soaked!!!
1,Strap ripped 2 days after return window. Very light and flimsy.
1,one time i wore the bag and it tore
1,Cute but smells like chemicals.
4,The backpack is very nice. It is very adorable and I am very excited to wear it to school. However there is one thing that I noticed right off the bat as soon as I opened it. I ripped the plastic off of the bag and I was immediately appalled by the awful smell. It smells very strongly of chemicals and it leaves me lightheaded to be in the same room as it because of the stench. I was put off because the smell meant I could not use it on my first day of school. I hung it up outside so it could air out for a day. 2 days. 3 days. It had been hanging outside of my house for an entire week and the effect it had on the stank was nonexistent. I put it through 2 or 3 hand washes and left it out to air out even more and nothing has worked.I am not sure if anyone else has encountered this issue but it is BAAAD. I have been through 2 weeks of high school now and it's been really hard to carry all of my homework to every single class. I am really disappointed because the bag itself is really high quality but I have been unable to use it because of the nauseating smell.
1,You Get what you pay for.
1,Small and the zippers are garbage
1,One of the straps broke off.
5,I have been using this backpack for over 2 years and I highly recommend it. I live in the Seattle area and I do not have a car. This water resistant bag has really pulled through. I fill it to the brim when I go grocery shopping and it has never had any leaking problems with the rain. I am due for a new one just because I want new colors and not for any other reason. I definitely plan on purchasing this same brand. I have been very impressed with this bag's durability and quality....particularly for the price! It's a great deal.
4,I used this backpack for my college classes and the bag over time managed to rip not one not two but three holes! I was upset because I loved this backpack and how many compartments it has. I would buy again but maybe for less heavy activities.
5,I had this backpack for 3+ years and it survived my senior year of high school up til the beginning of my junior year now including travel all over the US and a couple other countries! super great storage and very cute. Just the other day it finally gave out on me with the right strap snapping off but its because I had been hauling it around by that one strap for forever so it was a miracle it lasted that long anyways and I'm purchasing a new backpack from this company because it was so great all these years! Highly recommend.
5,Very sturdy you can feel the quality of the material. Like that it comes with extra pieces of leather for the zipper if one of them falls off. Also in the enterior there are three pockets one for a laptop which I did not see in the pictures. I bought the maroon/red one the color matches the pictures but my camera made it look weird. It came looking a bit boxy but after a little fluff it brought back its shape. Thank you! Will be using for college.
5,I've had this backpack for about 2 years now and it still is in great shape! I am normally brutal when it comes to backpacks and was replacing mine every 6 months until I received this one!Its lightweight and the perfect size for my 13in. laptop. I travel a lot and this bag has survived all of my adventures. It works well for a carry on when flying and is comfortable enough to take hiking. When I'm not travling I carry it with me day to day for work and school.Overal great quality anf an extreamly great price!
5,I love this bag and use it almost on a daily basis because I have to travel a lot. I will say do not over pack net net pocket inside because the lining in mine ripped. I reached out to customer service and they replaced my bag within a week. Love the bag and will be a repeat costumer in the future!
5,I've had this backpack for about a year and a half and its amazing!! It's not bulky or heavy but it still fits everything I need inside. The inside pockets are great for organization that way if I need to grab something quick I know exactly where to find it. And the laptop compartment comfortably fits my MacBook Air in its laptop sleeve. Overall I definitely recommend this backpack especially if you are a commuter and need to carry a lot with you everyday!!
5,I was surprised.  The bag is really nice however when my grandson went to put his binders in it it was way too small.  He has two 3" ring binders that he has too carry it would not fit.  too tight.  So thus we returned it.  The company offered another option however my grandson did not like that one.  There was no problem in getting our money back.  When I look for another bag I will shop here first.
5,I’m 30. Have recently went back to school and become a full time college student. I was never one to use book bags but I really love this one. Lots of handy pockets. Fits all my books and other belongings and securely holds and carries my laptop and other electronics. I’ve been using it for a year and a half now and I love it. I even use it when I’m not in school. Highly recommend.
5,It is doing great everything is going well the water resistance really helps
5,This is an amazing backpack with amazing customer service.
5,This backpack is excellent! I bought it to use as a diaper bag and it is so lightweight. There were more pockets than I had expected and the quality seems very good. This is by far better than the actual more expensive diaper bag we had originally bought (which broke twice with light use!) There company is very caring and was quick to respond with questions. We love our bag!
5,So far I have had this for one year and it is still in almost perfect condition!! I accidentally tore the strap but it is still intact and still holds all my stuff! Easy to wash and so comfortable! I have taken this bookbag on many trips it is just awesome!!!
5,I love the quality! It’s really water proof I tried it in the rain!
5,Linda sin errores de tela
5,After opening the box is was shipped in and we examined it 'up-close'  we were very impressed with its quality style and handsome looks or 'attractive' (if its for a girl). It is 'roomy' inside and also has a few additional handy pockets to place additional peripherals and/or other items as needed. Overall ... an excellent value !!!
5,I love this bag. It has so much space and as an AP student it holds so much stuff for the entire year and with all the built in pockets it helps with organization. I love it. Along with the material it works out sooooo nicely and it's great! It's a real treat and I recommend it to anyone; especially AP students who don't wanna carry around a luggage.
5,It's so much better than Jansport. It has room for literally everything and it's even water proof! That's so helpful when it rains and I don't want my textbooks to get wet. Probably the best priced backpack with a warranty! Certainly looking forward to buying more of this brand! Seller if you are reading this then please recommend me some other items!
5,My daughter loves it
5,good quality looks good not to fake lighwight to
5,Very very nice backpack. I have no had any issues with it. In fact I like that no mattet how you wear it the shape stays the same which is different from the herschels. I recommend very nice product
5,This bag is freaking awsome. I am a full time college student and have a 13' retina display macbook pro. It fits perfectly on this bag with everything else I need like folders chargers etc. It doesn't have all these crazy pockets and wierd looking things outside its nice and basic just like in high school. Exactly what I was looking for!
5,Love the color and love the bag !
3,i loved everything about this backpack except the smell. when it arrived it had a pretty strong chemically smell that I thought would wear off but after a couple months it didn't. I tried lots of things to get it away and it helped a little but it's still there. I loved everything else it's small but not to small. it has lots of pouches on the inside to hold stuff and it's very comfortable.
5,Excellent quality and a GREAT price!! This is a really nice backpack!!!
5,Bought for my daughter who is at college. Fits her laptop. She loves it!
3,I loved this backpack at first and I got it for my freshman year of college. However after only a few months the suede bottom became tough and scratchy and ended up destroying most of my leggings jeans and shirts because of its constant rubbing on the clothing. The rough suede created pilling and eventually holes in my pants and shirts making me replace both my backpack and clothing. I would not recommend!
5,Amazing backpack I recommend it to everyone
3,I got this book bag right before my sophomore year of college as a gift. When I first got it I loved it. It had the right amount of pockets I needed and could fit all my books. Sadly after only a semester of using it one of the seams on the straps are broken. I really liked this book bag but it more than likely won't las another semester. :(
5,Got this backpack as a gift for my son who is in need of a new backpack for school.  He loves it and the quality is great. He stuffs it full of books and it still holds up well.
5,Check out this video on this backpack. This video was approved by Vaschy. [...]
3,We bought this about 6 months ago. It worked well until the strap broke - see attached pic.
1,My son received this product from a teacher as a prize.  At first I thought it was great - finally a high-quality light weight backpack!  But within a month of using it a seem on the front pocket started to unravel in a spot that could not be repaired.  When I contacted Vaschy via their chat option on their website I rec'd an auto response that we could get 10% off our next order (as if I would buy their cheaply manufactured poorly supported product!).  When I replied to the auto-response I got nothing in response.
2,After about 6 months of use the stitching is already coming apart. The worst part is I don't even use the backpack with heavy weight. Just two notebooks and a textboook. That's it.You get what you pay for and I've gotten a bag that isn't properly stitched and falling apart.
2,Bag is definitely meant for fashion only. Not durable and cannot hold much weight. The right strap on my bag broke after a two weeks. I carry a laptop two books and a binder. And it started to tear.  I have had bags in the past hold hold up for years and i had more books back then.
2,this backpack is almost perfect but it smells like HELL. I tried to wash it but the the stench remained. I have to keep it because I don't think that can send it back but if you are looking for a backpack stay away from this one!!!
2,Love this backpack but the zipper is already broken. It's too late for a refund. Are the new zippers cheaply made? Ordering another and hoping it was a fluke with that pack.
1,Small
1,Prepare for the worst zipper designFinally had enough after the 10th jam
1,The zipper broke within 3 months of use...don't buy this
1,the zipper broke after a week
5,Took the backpack to Vegas with me for EDC and it fit everything I needed. This backpack can withstand lots of weight too. It can hold my Xbox One cables and 2 controllers!  On top of that you have other side pockets to add other miscellaneous items. Very true when it says "waterproof" 10/10 Left my backpack filled with electronics in the back of a pickup truck when it suddenly started raining. Around 15 min. after pulling over everything inside was dry :) Started school again so I got a black one.
5,Use this backback as my work backpack for the day. Extra clothes wipes deodorant cologne etc... love it stylish and super cheapcan't go wrong.
5,My son likes this product
5,Feels really durable and like a nice bag. Got it for school and it definitely feels like it will make it three the next few years holding my heavy books.
5,The best backpack I have used for daily life.
5,a little small but can fit tons of stuff with the many pockets
5,Hey guysI'm using this backpack for school. I already had a backpack but wanted a smaller backpack because all I really carry is a binder and iPad and some other things (lotion portable charger hand sanitizer hair brush etc). This backpack is great for everything. There are a LOT of pockets for all your things.  I know there aren't that many pictures of the pocket compartments so hopefully my pictures will help you guys decide whether this backpack is right for you or not. Anyways if you're wondering... The smaller pocket does NOT have smaller compartments to hold your pen and pencils. I tried to show it in the picture. It's just a big pocket with no additional small pockets. But the bigger pocket has six additional pockets. The back has three pockets. The pocket up top has a small compartment for things such as your phone. Then under that is a pocket for things like your laptop. Then the last one is a medium sized pocket for things like your tablet. I have an 11inch iPad pro with a Logitech combo touch case and it fits just right in there. Then you get three additional pockets in the main pocket towards the front. One is a mesh pocket as seen in the picture and then there are two additional smaller pockets under it. I'll be putting things like a portable charger in there. Anyways my first impression of this backpack is great. It reminds me of a Jansport backpack but better to be honest because it has so many available compartments. Last but not least there are two water bottle holders on each side. Fits a water bottle easily no problem. Hope you guys found my review and pictures to be useful. ☺️
5,Bought for our 10 yr for school and he is all about camo hunting gear and absolutely loves it! Very well made
4,The backpack is smaller than expected but can be used for small and light travelling. It is sturdy.
5,Excellent price and very high quality
5,I'm in love with this backpack! It's really roomy and there are so many pockets to help organize. I also like the fact that it's not that expensive. I've had this backpack for about a week. I don't carry light I usually bring as many textbooks as I can plus my personal belongings. It's sturdy enough to hold my 3 textbooks laptop chargers 3 notesbooks pencil cases reading material wallet and water bottle and there is still room left. I'm also not very kind to it I usally just throw my backpack around so it's held up well to the abuse so far. Also the straps are padded enough that it's comfortable for all day use even when carrying heavy. Since it's only been a week and a few days I can't testify on it's longevity but so far I am very pleased.
5,I love the size of this backpack and the good quality. I carry this everywhere because my youngest son requires a lot of medication so a purse just isn’t realistic. It has plenty of space for my stuff and his.
5,I daily use the backpack and I got to tell you it's amazing simple with a nice pink colors it mix really well. I haven't had any issues with this I have had this for over a year
5,Ya tengo 2 años con la mochila y a sido muy resistente la recomienda
5,Much nicer than expected!
5,I can fit my books and pads etc nicely
5,This is my favorite backpack! My daughter had hers for 3 years with no rips or tears in it. The only reason we got her a mew one was because she wanted a different color! My son is working on his 3 year of the same backpack as well. They even was well. Hands down best backpack around.
5,This backpack was a gift for a high school student.  He was very pleased with the bag the storage and the design.
5,Buen color y capacidad fuertebonita
5,The book bag is great. You do get some water stains and it is not 100% waterproof. It fits everything that I need. The book bag itself is light weight so you aren't carrying additional weight. The straps are nice thick and plush so they your shoulders won't hurt.
3,Very starchy fabric out of box moderate amount of room for things wish it had more pockets.Laptop protection not sure yet.
5,I purchased this backpack for a Disneyland trip with my family. I wore it all day and was able to fit everything I needed. There are many pockets and zippers to store all your goodies. I use Bluetooth headphones so I haven’t had a need for the pass through wire system. Though I suspect when I need to charge my phone with a portable battery this will be perfect if I still need to use my phone but hide the battery. I definitely recommend this backpack and hope to keep using it for years to come. It’s made with sturdy material lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap. Thumbs up in my book 👍
5,I just received this product! Pictured is what it looked like after taking it out of the plastic packaging (was shipped in a box). Everything seems to be working right; I can't speak for how it handles weight since I haven't used it yet. I also like how many pockets there are I've not had a backpack with his many before.The side pockets perfectly fit normal water bottles I'm not sure they'd fit anything any/much bigger. One thing I don't love is the bottom of the bag (also pictured) -- it's nice for aesthetic reasons but I'd hope whatever material it is is water/stain proof in case I set the backpack down on something or smudge it against something.
4,The backpack is pretty lightweight and has enough space for a 15" laptop. Straps look solid and durable.
5,Great backpack for travelling hiking beaches etc. Exactly what I was looking for and it will come in handy!
5,Love this backpack
4,The backpack over all is ok. The color and layout of the backpack is good. I don’t love the material is too rough. When you touch it . it hard.. and to me that feels kinda cheap. But other than that it’s ok.
5,Exactly what I needed for school and vacations. So many pockets and fits everything I need. Very durable straps and zipper
5,I had this for over 2 years and it has been such a good quality backpack for the cost.
5,Very nice
5,Size was perfect
5,My granddaughter loved it!
5,Good quality
5,I purchased this for my son a year and half ago.  He loves it and carries so much in it.  It finally wore out and I wanted to purchase the same one.  We have loved this bag and very impressed with the quality and longevity of it.
5,Full size backpack my daughter bought for school
5,It has great compartment space and is a great quality backpack.
4,Everything was okay the space was good and size is a great length
5,This is a well constructed backpack that is light has plenty of pockets and storage. It fits a laptop and few other books etc or can be used an over night travel bag. It looks high end and is very comfortable.
5,buen material y resistente
3,The backpack is made of a strong fabric it does not fit many books it is for light use.  only bring two deposits the bag in front and the big one
4,I bought this book bag for my 7th grade daughter. She has a lot of binders and things that she has to bring back and forth at school and her old book bag was getting small. She got the color Tangerine and it is lighter than in the picture which she likes a lot. It is more of a coral/salmon pink. The bag has a lot of pockets which is useful to her as it makes it easier to be organized. The water bottle pockets are also very useful as they are not the type with holes that break easily but I t would be better if they were more stretchy/bigger to fit a bigger bottle. The zippers are also very nice. They work smoothly look pretty and hold very well. The bag came with two extras which is great. The only thing that we didn’t like about this book bag is that it carries a very slight smell with it though it is barely noticeable. Overall this is a great book bag!
5,Granddaughter loved it
5,room for water bottles laptop and items I want to insert. Havent actually wore it yet  that comes in a week. Hopefully I will still find it works/fits well.
5,This is the most well made and durable pack with all the right features in the right places as well as a strongly reinforced base.
5,Produce as described with lots of room!! Sturdy and roomy
5,I used have large computer backpacks but I had a tendency to overpack things and would end up lugging around a 20 lb backpack everywhere. The smaller size of this backpack was a godsend since it encouraged me to only bring the essentials. Tack on the fact that it looks great and is somewhat water resistant and you've got yourself a great backpack!
5,It's nice not too many pockets to overwhelm you. It has a laptop pocket and a good amount of room. I was worried about the zippers but it is good quality so no worries about that. I don't even need a pencil case because it has a convenient pocket (no not the front one but the mesh one at the top once you open it) I love the pocket for the water too it fits a plastic one nicely anything bigger is probably a no go so you have been warned.
5,My daughter uses this for school. It fits 5 notebooks 2 calculators 2 water bottles snacks a pencil case and 2 textbooks easily. The many pockets inside the pack back are very useful and were obviously very thoughtfully placed. Great purchase!
5,Nice item have bought 2 so far!
5,Accidentally purchased this one thinking it was another brand but was surprised by the quality of the backpack. My daughter uses it for school and she is rough on it. She has used it from Aug-Jan now and the backpack looks good as new and has not had any damage. I cannot say the same for the backpack I purchased for her from a box store last year. Again great quality for the price!  I will be ordering this brand again for the next school year!
5,I bought this backpack for work travel. It’s much easier and more convenient to carry through the airport and has a lot of space for my laptop iPad chargers mouse and headphones! Highly recommend.
5,It's been months since I've purchased it and it's still going strong.
5,Bought this backpack for my bother who is in middle school. So far it last him and has enough room for all his notebooks pens pencils. Really is a spacious backpack considering that he fits 6 notebooks! Highly recommend!
5,I like it looks good and good enough size
5,great back pack for school camping or emergency's keeping supplies battery's first aid extra flashlights and rations after experiencing Hurricane Harvey in Houston this product serves as a back up for items in case one has to evacuate for any natural disaster. item arrived in timely manner.
5,I've already purchased this backpack twice. Both backpacks arrived on time looked as described on amazon and shown in the photos. One of my best Amazon purchases of all time!
5,Backpack sturdy and lots of room for school books and laptop
5,Extremely well thought out design.Simple but still stylish provides its person with immense storage for everyday items.
5,As described
5,Excellent quality feel to the bag all zips and straps all seem top knotch.So far so good!
4,Other than it’s not water resistant like it shows on the photo everything else is good like it was advertised. It’s raining day today and all my stuff in this bag got wet my phone in the front pocket is covered with water certainly not what I expected. I’ll make sure that next time it rains I’ll use other bags. :(Update: Customer service contacted me right away and offer to refund for this item. I do appreciate the prompt service. It is good bag and I purchased another one right after I received this item but before the rainy day will have to purchase rain cover for the bags.
4,Quality same as mentioned and the style is good for my daughter to go to school.
5,I got the Red and bluish-green/teal (even though it looks like blue in the photo).My boys love it. It is waterproof. I did a quick test with running water and it did not show any wet spot. So this is perfect especially for rain and winter seasons.The zippers are durable opens and closes smoothly. There are a quite a number of pockets inside the backpack which can be seen in previous reviews but I will upload something soon.I just got this today so I will update my review after a couple of months.
5,Very good quality and looks awesome! Material is thick and all the details are very well made . Very happy with this purchase . I was gonna buy one of the Herschel’s backpacks but I just can’t justify spending so much money basically just for a name brand tag . This backpack is as good as Hershel !Update : I’ve been using it for 2 weeks now and it’s perfect . It is definitely waterproof as it was raining and the water slid right off it . Love it !
5,As discussed. Color is the same as the picture. Lots of pockets inside great for organizing everything. Works great for every day life fits more then I expected which is fantastic. Havent been able to see if/how water resistant it is. Perfect price for good quality. Material is thicker then I expected making it more durable then other backpacks I've had. Would definitely recommend!
5,I was heavily considering purchasing some fancy branded $100+ backpacks but just decided I'm not gonna see much real life difference compared to an inexpensive Amazon one. I was right.It's sturdy colour looks good it hasn't ripped or cut after months of use. Overall happy. And it actually has quite a few storage areas inside including a few full zippers.
5,J'ai beaucoup hésité entre un sac à dos Herschel et celui-ci et j'ai finalement décidé de prendre ce sac. La qualité du sac est très bonne voir identique à un sac Herschel. Les fermetures éclaires sont solides et le bas du sac est bien renforcé. Les poches à l'intérieur sont spacieuses et aussi bien solide (par exemple le filet est épais et ne déchirera pas facilement). Bref je suis très heureux de mon choix!!
5,I love my Vaschy! It's pink it's big and gorgeous. Not very comfortable to wear to wear on bare shoulders though...It rubs right where the trapeze muscle is and chafs. But the material is strong rugged and the suede bottom makes it solid and stands up. I use it as a diaper-travel bag to carry my two daughters' stuff (3y.o and 2month old). I would recommend. The color is true to the picture exactly that cute pink color.
5,I bought this to use as a carry-on and for a two week trip to Egypt. It withstood being tossed all over the place and still looks brand new. It was comfortable to wear for a five hour hike. The colour matches what is shown in the photo and the size is perfect. The little tabs that are attached to the zippers do seem to fall off easily which I guess is why they give you extra.
5,I bought this backpack for my first year of university. The colour is very nice and it's very comfortable. Very durable and still looks great after the year has finished. It'll most likely last for the rest of my undergrad with only minor wear and tear. The laptop pocket fits my Chromebook nicely with plenty of room for a bigger laptop. The main pocket has lots of room for textbooks lunches and other items as needed. The mesh pocket is especially nice for easy access to pencil cases gum tissues etc. The front pocket is also fairly roomy and will fit an average-sized novel or pocket planner. The two bottle holders on either side of the bag fit a Contigo bottle perfectly but won't fit a Hydroflask or wider bottles. It also works well for holding a small umbrella. The canvas is nice and relatively thick and protected my laptop and books from moderate rain and snow. Most likely won't buy again because this one will last me so long! Great purchase.
5,This backpack is amazing for any students especially students with multiple textbooks like me. it fits my laptop binder 2-3 big textbooks chargers pens wallet etc and it still has ample room. I am definitely not disappointed with this purchase. Will recommend to friends and family. You get what you paid for and this is wonderful.
2,La qualité semble bonne par contre les couleurs sont vraiment très décevante mes enfants avaient choisi leur sac à dos de sorte qu’ils fitent avec leur boîte à lunch mais ce ne sera pas du tout le cas..
4,Because I take public transit and pick up my son from daycare this bag helped reduce all the bags I had to carry.  The bag is lightweight has several pockets and water resistant. I would have given it 5 star if not for the little hook inside the front pocket breaking after a week. I used it to secure my keys. It wasn’t worth the hassle to return but I wish it would have been metal instead of plastic.
5,The delivery took forever I’m talking awhole week while on prime was very disappointed by amazon. I wrote to customer services a few time never got a reply which is unusual I’ve been using prime for a few years and on the few occasions there have been delays I had they representatives reach or try to make it easier for me. I still give it four stars because the quality of the product wasn’t affected by my bad experience. But finally when I did get the back I couldn’t have hope for better. It’s very lightweight but still sturdy. Fits all my notebooks and binders and is comfortable enough for long days at uni. Will be updating review when the winter comes to test how water resistant it really is.
5,My daughter usually has a ton of homework  this bag has been comfortable for  her to wear  and appears to be handling the weight of her textbooks well.  Her previous bag was sagging and ripping along the seams so I was hoping this one would be more durable  and so far it is holding up perfectly.  It also looks really good!
5,I got this for somebody as a gift. I hadn't realized this brand of backpack had become so "trendy" until after I purchased this. Prior to making this purchase I had never heard of this bag and always assumed Jansport was the go-to for everyday backpacks. The recipient loved it and it was large enough for her to use to bring to school every day and fit everything she needs. I wasn't a fan of the color but it was the color chosen by the recipient. It is not as "mustard" of a yellow that the photo makes it appear as though - it's a pretty true yellow color.
5,I have been using this backpack for the past year now and I absolutely love this thing. I know a couple of the reviews on it said that it was too small but I truly don't know what they are talking about. I am by no means a small person and this backpack is the perfect size for me. It is extremely durable holds everything you could ever really need it to (and goodness knows I test those limits every day) and it has enough compartments that it provides good organization without so many that you have to search for 5 minutes to find those keys you swore you put somewhere.  The only thing that is kind of a bummer is that the pockets on the side of the bag for water bottles aren't big enough for any kind of water bottle or travel mug but the bag itself is big enough to fit those! Honestly just get it - this bag is amazing!
1,One of the plastic parts on the straps have broken and the main part has a hole in it. Purchased in September 2019 and it is only December 2019 and I have a very adult teenager (not a rough and tumble little kid). Annoyed and disappointed.
5,I’ve been using this backpack going to lectures for the past couple months. It’s been way more durable than I expected and the only wear I’ve seen is some salt stains on the bottom from sitting on dirty floors. It holds its form super well although I wish it had a slightly larger capacity it holds multiple textbooks without issue. It’s also fairly waterproof and has withstood a few rainy walks home and falls in the snow. Overall a great bag and definitely one that is built to last.
4,This backpack does the trick.  I'm using it primarily to haul around diapers/toys/clothes for my toddler. One of the zipper tags already fell off after a week of use but it does not interfere with opening or closing the bag. It has a decent amount of space without being too bulky to wear it. I like the inside smaller pockets and side pockets for water bottles. The material does feel a tad cheap but it's perfectly fine for the price.
5,I have been using this bag for about 3 weeks now and I can say it's a very functional bag of good quality. The fabric and the bottom of the bag feel rugged to the touch. It fits comfortably on the back and the internal pockets are helpful to keep a lap top or notebooks. What you get for what you pay is very reasonable. It's a great substitute for not overpaying on the name brand.
5,This product is amazing. My daughter going into Grade 8 is so happy with this product. The size is adequate to fit a large zipper binder pencil case lunch bag and gym clothes. Water beads off nicely. Colour grey is beautiful picture does not do the colour justice. Like a moss grey. Liked it so much we ordered the black one for our friends daughter and she loved it!
5,Nice day bag for school or work or whatever. Not too small and not too big. Laptop pocket and nice main pocket size. A couple of nice dividers and pockets in the main. Two small side pouchs for small umbrella although small bottles work too. Nice looking and it is water resistant. (tested in some good rain)
5,I bought this for my sister and she loves it. The colour is exactly like the picture. I have a similar one but I love the purple/maroon colour would switch mine for this colour. Works great and that's why I bought it again and recommend it to everyone.It's waterproof and durable. Worth the price!
5,the material feels sturdy. It has so many pockets and all of them are very nice and i haven't had any trouble with the zippers. Fits all the unruly amount of stuff i carry. 10/10 would buy more colours cause i like to buy stuff and this is something i would like to buy again.
1,My Original bag ripped after a while of use. They then sent a replacement a month ago and the replacement they sent me broke in 2 weeks. I am very disappointed. The stitches on the straps are very weak and it ripped.
5,Very neat and lovely looking bag. Only part where I retracted a star is because of water durability. Brought it outside recently and a thunderstorm broke out did not foresee it as it appeared unlikely in a weather forecast. To be fair it was a very abundant rainfall but some items inside the bag got wet regardless so 'completely waterproof' might be a bit wrong. I'm sure it holds up in moderate rain though so just a single star retracted... considering the downpour I think it could've been a lot worst.
5,Been using it for school for over a year now and no signs of wear and tear. I wouldn't exactly call it waterproof as it does tend to absorb water but it doesn't ruin the books inside either. Looks just like the Herschel backpacks and made up of decent quality too so I would definitely recommend picking this if you wanna save those extra bucks.
5,This backpack is the best backpack I've ever bought! I love the inside pockets it makes everything so easily organized. The bag overall is very well made and very sturdy. It's exactly the bag I've been looking for not too big just perfect enough to fit everything I need. When I opened the bag I received a thankyou note and a huge plastic bag from Vaschy which I thought was so sweet. 100% would recommend to anyone.
5,Love this backpack! It was exactly as shown in the picture. Not too big not too small prefect size! I have 2 young boys and use this bag instead of a diaper bag. It fits all their snacks sippy cups toys spare clothes diapers blankets and still has room left! I ivArrived a few days earlier than expected. Even came with a thank you note and a little plastic vaschy bag inside. Extremely happy!!
5,Backpack is really very high quality.  I got this for 9y old boy. Strong zipper which is very important with young kids. Soft shoulder stripes nice colours we god the blue and brown (suede like). Side pockets are well done bottle stays inside all day. Nice design even for adults.
5,Color is even prettier in person. It's a very sturdy and lovely backpack. It has several nice pockets inside including a section to place a laptop.  Straps are padded and comfy. I have had it for over a year and it looks as good as new.
1,its waayyy smaller then it looks would be much more suitable for a elementary schooler and if you buy the grey one with leather bottom its much more of a a greeny bluey gray and not anything like the color in the picture. i returned it
5,My son was super excited to get his back pack it fit literally everything we bought for back to school. It came with replaceable things for the zippers which is great. Had alot of extra storage pockets inside and I always do a weight test with the kids back packs so they don't break at school and it was able to hold a 75 pound weight and it didn't show any signs of tearing or ripping. The only thing was is I had to leave a dryer sheet in the packaging with the backpack because it had an odd smell at first.
4,VERY impressed. I have purchased two of these backpacks. The pink one for my daughter 5 years ago and the black one for my son 3 years ago. I will be replacing the pink one with  another color this year only because my daughter is over pink.Impressive quality. Easy to clean. I have thrown them both in the wash and spot cleaned them. They remain in excellent condition.Word of caution- the pink one had a TERRIBLE smell that took months to get out. Smelled like moth balls. The black one has no smell.Super fast shipping. Came the next day.
5,His backpack works for exactly what I bought it for. I needed something small that wasn't childish or look like it should be a teen's backpack. I bring qA water bottle my laptop textbook writing utensils and notebooks plus snacks. Perfect for adults and the quality is great
5,I bought this backpack for my 6 year old  son and he was so happy with it ( very well made and packaged well). We haven't  tested it yet if it will  be waterproof.. but I have a feeling it will be great to keep everything  dry etc on rainy/snowy  days ( by how well its built and you cant beat the price)
5,Been 4 months since school started. My daughter just started middle school I doubted the water resistant until it was a downpour for a few days and everything inside was dry. Very impressed.
1,Unfortunately this backpack managed to ruin my expensive T-shirts before I noticed that the bottom fake leather on the backpack becomes hard&rough and rubs against my clothes.How much do you value your shirts? Probably a lot more than this backpack...Do not buy.
5,LOVE this backpack and so does my daughter (who I bought it for). Great quality zipper is very sturdy backpack holds a lot. Lots of pockets inside and true to colour. Nice canvas-like material doesn’t look cheap. Will be buying another one in a different colour for my other daughter. Even considering buying one for myself!
5,Great bag. Has a lot of storage room inside and different pockets dividers. Definitely recommend it to the students. Or whoever carrys a laptop or want a bagpackt that can hold stuff very organizingly.
5,This backpack has been awesome so far! It’s gotten me through weeks of school and traveling rainy west coast weather and 4 plane rides. It’s spacious and doesn’t strain my back and neck. Love it!
3,Teh quality is good. no doubt. But the zips are a bit stressful to use. gets struck often. and finally the inner soace is limited. good for laptops and a notebook. not for too many things. the slots in the sides of the bag are cool. handy to carry hardisks and imporant documents. lik that part.
4,Was smaller than we wanted so we did return it but seemed like a good bag. Seemed to be of good quality.  If a laptop and cooking “uniform” didn’t need to be brought to and from school daily with remote learning due to covid it probably would have sufficed. The colour was nice too!
5,So many pockets and places to put things! Great for people who like organization and carrying multiple things in their backpack. Very afforadable. Haven’t had it for that long so I can’t really comment on the quality. The zipper tags fell off when I first got it but tightening them fixed the issue. I don’t like that it is trying so hard to look like another brand but I like that it looks simple. Very affordable.
3,It is made of good quality materials and nice knapsack but more child-sized than teen or young adult size and would be difficult to squeeze a 14" laptop into this and have room for anything else.
2,It's my second time ordering this one . Theres a whole that happen . I never put my bad directly on the flood and this is happening . A bit disappointed for the cost of it .
5,Daughter is in university and was ashamed that she had to use her very pungent soccer bag to lug her air Mac to classes. No one would sit beside her except other soccer players. With bag no smelly cleats and maybe she can meet a smart science major to cheat off of.
5,The initial product was too small for our needs but the fantastic customer service exchanged our bag for one that was more suitable to our needs and the price was great.  Excellent product for the price! Thank you Vaschy.
5,It's cheap it's durable it looks good. I wish it was more waterproof but hey I didn't pay much for it. I've carried heavy stuff in it and nothing has come loose so far. Highly recommended.
4,The book bag is great seems durable and looks exactly like pic I’ve been using it for two days now and I’m only taking one star off because of the smell. It just smells like chemicals but that will go away soon I hope. If it doesn’t I’m going to put it in the washing machine. But I totally recommend this bag it’s great fits my MacBook and folders and has pockets on the side!
3,Upon receiving the product we could see it was of good quality however based on the pictures it appeared to be bigger (hold more stuff). The size was disappointing.
5,Simply put - awesome. This is the 3rd bag that I bought - 1 for wife daughter and son. I love the reinforced bottom as my son is constantly ripping out the bottom after dragging it through everything. A+++!
5,It showed up earlier than I thought.  The quality is awesome and my daughter is very happy with how light it is to carry but still very roomy for all of her things.  It comes with a tag with a lifetime warranty so hopefully we won't need to use that.
5,I like this bag not too small and not too big.It has enough room for all my books my laptop wireless mouse charging cables 1L water bottle and my headphones.I've only used it for 2-3 weeks in Canada in snow storms; so I expect this to last 2 years at least.
5,I adore this bag however I do have one minor annoyance! The little brown looped tabs on the zippers undo quite often so I'm tightening them often. I just took them off and use the regular zipper because it was annoying me.
4,Picture is misleading. I saw the pouches on the sides and thought they were bug enough to hold drinks; they are not. Other than that excellent quality!
5,Very durable bag and nice quality. The weight is okay.The bag looks brand new after 3 years and i used it to travel the middle east and greece #sandrocks
5,Feels like a good quality bag plenty of space and pockets so I can’t complain but the only issue I’ve had is that the drink bottle holders on either side are a tad small and will only really hold a plastic water bottle or smaller. Not a huge issue still a very solid bag.
4,as a student I carry a laptop and notebooks on the go. If you add a sleeve to your laptop for extra protection it wont fit inside the laptop pocket. I have a 13" macbook pro and it cant fit more. I had a couple issues with the zipper but thats pretty much it. the material is decent and the design is adequate I will continue using this bag for the up coming future.
4,It is a nice bag good quality and water resistant. Seems to be quite sturdy with good quality straps & zipper pulls. It is not quite big enough to carry sneakers lunch binders textbooks etc. for high school but nice bag overall.
5,I have been using this bag for 4 months now it easily holds my 13" laptop four books a small water bottle and a pencil case in its main pocket. The sides are too small to put a bottle so they can only hold pens maybe a wallet or a phone. The small pocket in the front is also pretty useful to hold sunglasses a portable charger etc. The straps are soft and the back is padded so carrying it on the shoulders is very comfortable.
5,This backpack exceeded my expectations in build design and materials. The least appealing part of the product is the leather extended straps for the zipper but I just simply remove them as it keeps falling off and can tear easily. Other than that - this is a solid product for its price!
5,The bag was too small for the intended use (as a school backpack for my teenager) but as served us well as a regular backpack. The quality of the bag is very good.
5,My son loves this backpack. It's a great size for school. The zipper started separating after he had used it for about a year. I contacted Vaschy customer service and they promptly replied apologized and sent a replacement backpack. I will definitely order from them again. Great backpack and great customer service!
5,Really cool bag however smaller than I expected so I had to buy a larger bag for all of my binders and what not. But I use this one for work.
5,il est pratique beau et solide .  il est rembourré ce qui est pratique pour ne pas abîmer le contenu et le rend plus solide . Les sangles sont facilement adaptables .il a la taille idéal pour l école .Je l’ai imperméabilisé pour le conserver propre plus longtemps . J en ai acheté 2 autres depuis ! 👍
5,This backpack is fantastic! I've had it for a few weeks now and love it. The straps are comfortable and the backpack is a good size. It holds more stuff than you'd expect. My only note is that the water bottle holders on the sides are pretty small so if you have a wide waterbottle or if your bag is full you might need to carry it somewhere else. Otherwise I love it!
5,Bought this backpack after my previous one fell apart. I am loving it so far. It looks small but can carry quite a lot including my laptop. Very pleased with the product. Would definitely recommend.
5,Très satisfait produit d'excellente qualité à bon prix. Livraison rapide et bien emballé. Plusieurs rangements à l'intérieur.
5,Was a lovely bag however I returned mine because it was not what I was seeking. Great company and very accepting of returns. Thank you!
5,Very good quality and looks !Material is thick and all the details are very well made. I want just let you know that black one is little bit smaller than others.I want to buy 2 same size backpack so I was exchanged black one to navy color backpack.Blue and navy color are same size!My 2 sons are so happy with that. ♡
2,I found this backpack to be quite small.  It was for my seventeen year old son and yes it holds a laptop but it is very small for a teenage young adult.  It should say that it is more suitable for elementary or primary school sized students.
5,Much easier to carry things now that I have to use a cane to get around.  Roomy and big enough I can put everything I need in it for Doctor appointments!
5,a great bag i’ve been using it for like three years and it’s in great condition still! the pockets are my favourite feature there are so many
5,Bon sac à dos assez robuste pour l'utiliser au quotidien. Imperméable et avec une grande capacité de stockage je peux y ranger sans problème mon pc portable de 15''.Sac basique de bonne qualité je recommande !
5,It’s a great back pack for students has a laptop compartment and pockets to keep other small items. Honestly I can’t think of going to school without this bag. Customer service is top notch as well. A little inner tear emerged in my bag thus I emailed Vaschy customer service they happily replaced my bag with a brand new one free of charge.
4,It’s too big for me for my daily purpose. It has many rooms and 2 side pockets that are good to carry bottles.I might return it as i need a smaller one. But generally is good to buy.
5,This backpack is perfect for creating a smaller load to your back. It can hold a chromebook binder writing tools and PPE easily.
5,I am extremely impressed with the colour and quality of this product. I ordered the blue/green colour for my child and it was a huge hit. Would definitely recommend!!!
5,Ce sac est parfait pour la rentrée à la maternelle! Résistant imperméable et confortable pour mon garçon très satisfaite !!
5,I love this bag! It is exceptionally made and the perfect size with zippers compartments and two bottle holders. Make sure to check the size as it is not meant for laptops larger than 13-14".Thank you Vaschy for making such a great product! I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,Utilisation pour l'école.Tres bon choix pour le tissus et pour l'espace pour les cartables et autres. Mon garçon de 12 ans adore et moi je le recommande 👍
5,I bought a Vaschy Classic School Backpack and noticed the stitches of the mesh pocket inside the bag came loose after a couple of months. After contacting Vaschy with a photo of the defect and explaining the situation. I was offered a replacement with no questions asked.
4,I use it for traveling and it's enough to put all the GoPro jacket and other stuff. Very practical and lots of pockets and sections in it to put small items.
5,Great backpack. Just what I was looking for! Colour is wonderful I get lots of compliments. Fits all I need for work and for travel.
5,It’s a great backpack! Good quality and the material very strong!  Very responsible price! Arriveed on time.Bought this one for my husband and he lreally loved the color! Highly recommend
4,The size is good though it is a little thin so be mindful of that if you have a lot of stuff to put in the bag. Water-resistance seems pretty good but the suede bottom doesn't seem water-resistant. The colour is as shown in the images and there are many pockets.
5,The bag is really good but there was a delivery issue. However the bag arrived and I really love it. Its not too big neither too small. Fits laptop and notebooks easily. Good for school/university
5,She hasn’t used it yet but when the school year starts I am sure it will be great. The one year warranty helps
5,My 13yr old daughter loves the backpack. She was so excited as it is exactly as described and arrived on time. We ordered the pink and black version and the pink is lovely and vibrant. Made from optimal quality fabric the backpack has lots of space with various internal pockets. We are very happy with this great value purchase!
5,Purchased the first one for 5 years old girl then another for Grade 4 student in few month; both of them are in very good shape and very versatile in using for over a year time.
5,My boys love these trendy backpacks they are a little on the small side for the teenager in high school but it does fit his big binder & lunch.  Quality seems good extra zipper pulls are a nice bonus.
5,By far the best bag I have bought for my kids. I have paid stupid money for past ones.  This one is far better built than the $140 ones I have bought in the past.
4,The backpack is generally good quality and size.  I would liked to have the bottom part made of real leather instead. Also the zipper leather straps keep falling off.
5,Bought this for a friend and she uses it all the time! Very well made and durable. I love the laptop sleeve and overall organization. Very comfortable to wear looks great and will probably last her a couple years at least. Very nice!
5,This bag is great quality I have been using it for about a month and it has not failed me yet. Great for holding my duotangs and looseleaf.Would recommend for anyone looking for a simple yet reliable school bag.
5,Really nice water repellent you can see water droplets on the backpack. Had plenty pockets inside and side water bottle pockets too
5,This bag is a amazing!At first I didn't really like it.But after using it for a while for my toddler instant of a diaper bag is great.Lots of pockets to organize.Great for when I go to the hospital.So for I love it! Normally I don't write any review but I give 5 stars
5,My daughter loves it and it seems to be holding up well. Good size for all her school stuff.
5,Really nice backpack. Expect it to travel well. Regular use for walks to the grocery or book stores where I plan to or just in case make a relatively small purchase. Or to return a few books to the library via walking.
5,Sac a dos pour mon fils il est très satisfait et le sac a dos est de bonne qualité reste a voir s'il sera résistant et pour combien de temps. Livraison en 24h. Service rapide merci
1,Wayy smaller than expected cannot fit a lot in
5,A lot of pockets to store stuff in the bag. It looks good.  The straps are too long but pretty easy to tuck them away.
5,My daughter loves the colour. It has lots of pockets for her things. Haven’t had any wet weather to see how water resistant it is but so far it’s great!
5,We absolutely love this bag. There was a slight issue with the stitching and we contacted the company about our concerns. They responded promptly and resolved our problem immediately. It was a great experience. We will continue to buy our bags from Vaschy.
4,Nice well made bag unfortunately has a very strong chemical smell that I can’t seem to get rid of. Washed it and have left it airing out for 2 days with no luck.
3,This bag is advertised as water-resistant; however from light rain my laptop was absolutely drenched. I am very unhappy with this product.Update: The seller got back to me quickly and offered a refund for the product. Great customer service!
5,My second time buying from Vaschy am very pleased with the quality. The fabric will feel stiff at first but after two to three use the fabric soften up. it is perfect size for my for the new MacBook Air 13'. the bag also comes with a one year warranty no defects.
4,Good size simple aesthetics.Padded backpack has a good quality feel to it. The faux suede is a nice touch instead of faux leather (vinyl)Purchased the dark grey/ brown suede combo it looks great in person.
5,i Really love it sadly it didn't came on time though but i absolutely love the backpack. i love the color i picked and its so roomie alot of people liked my bag it totally fit my binder my art stuff etc highly recommend it =)
5,Colour is darker than expected though for us that was great as the colour wasn't "too girly" for my son. There are lots of pockets and compartments inside and out. The backpack is a great size and feels like it'll last a while.
5,Bag is exactly as shown in the picture. It is very light weight. I bought this for our Europe trip and it was very convenient to wear it and walk on the streets. Bag has enough pockets and space to fit Cannon camera documents small umbrella water bottle and power bank. Quality is also very good. I would strongly recommend.
5,Such a beautiful bag! The details and quality for the buck is second to none.
5,I was surprised how great this bag's quality is. It has many pockets inside the main compartiment for phone wallet etc. The material is really sturdy and has a great feel to it! Would buy again
1,This is the worst I won’t even have the chance to try it out because the smell is so bad.....it smells like it’s being dipped in toxic waste...I’ve washed and soaked it at least 20 times and still the smell is way to strong to send to school with my child. Very disappointed.
4,very comfortable and has a lot of space pretty much 10/10 other than the fact that the backpack (that came in a box) is wrapped in plastic. try paper?
4,Nice pack not sure how it will hold up but it seems well made and has a nice thickness.
3,Backpack looks great. I just pulled it out of the bag and there is a rip on n the side where the water bottle goes.My son loves the colour and is upset his first backpack is wrecked. I am hoping we can exchange for a new one without any rips
5,Solid backpack with lots of pockets.I’m 5’4’’ and the backpack covers my entire back. Great size. Colour is a bit more green than expected but still so nice!
4,It's a quality made backpack. Very light and simple. However it lacks any padding in the laptop sleeve area especially the bottom. Otherwise it'd be a 5 star review.
5,Bought for my 13 year old kid he liked it a lot. It’s water resistance it has many compartment to keep different things
5,The overall appearance is great have a certain degree of water proofing. But the leathers on zipper is easy to loose
5,I’m a teacher and this backpack holds my chromebook books journal pencil case and folders of work with room to spare. It’s comfortable on my shoulders. The pockets are great for organization. I love the maroon color.
5,Good product. Materials decent zippers decent not too big and inside is waterproof.
5,Great product. Durable waterproof hold your stuff in place. Really works well as a backpack. I had trouble with the zipper but I sent them an email and literally a week later I had a new backpack. Super helpful and very friendly. Thanks Vaschy!
5,Functional stylish and exactly as promised. The various zippered pocket spaces inside are really nice for keeping things organized.
5,Awesome bag nice and sturdy lots of room and it's actually water resistant.
5,Very nice backpack! A lot of room and really sturdy material. Thank you! 💜
5,Take this bag every where nothing wrong so far and it’s been a few months I take to work and back everyday not easy on it and it looks still brand new
5,Loving this bag I don’t need to carry lots of things yet the things I do this fits all my needs. If you want a small bag that can fit a laptop and just some smaller things some binders/notebooks. Then I’d highly recommend this.
4,We’re a couple months into school and it’s holding up well for my 7 year old who is rough on his stuff
5,Purchased for international student and she loves it so far it is just the right size.
5,It easily holds everything my daughter needs for a busy day at school - laptop books etc. with room to spare.  It seems to be sturdy enough and looks good.
5,Very nice backpack similar to Herschel brand great quality
5,Nice - light weight lots of storage compartments for small things and easy to adjust.
5,This backpack is for my son it’s his second one he wants nothing else he just loves it!  Small but plenty of room for books and portable.
5,Bought this thinking it was a Herschel backpack turns out it wasn't but it looks feels and puts out as if it is! Love it!
5,Great value bag very good quality and my daughter loves it.
5,The backpack is what I expected I’ve alwasy wanted one of these bags all my friends had one and when I saw it on amazon I bought it for college next year! It was also a very fast delivery too which I liked
5,The backpack was perfect for travelling in italy. It was light and sturdy and I was amazed on how much the bag could hold. I was able to pack dishes and glassware without any problems. Great buy.
5,At  16.9" x 11.8" x 5.9" this is almost exactly the maximum size for an Air Canada Carry-on personal item (17" x 13" x 6").  It also holds it shape much better than cheaper bags.
5,Ce sac est léger et est très bin construit.
5,OMG I love this backpackInfact it’s perfectFits my laptop textbooks gym clothes and water bottle.I got the camo it’s amazingIt’s worth the price
5,High quality bag for my daughter she loves it and looks cute and is also very durable and easy to clean
3,Well made but very small.  My laptop did not fit.
5,My daughter is in grade 6 and she loves thisBackpack.
5,Great backpack! It's the perfect size to take on hikes with enough pockets to easily sort your stuff. I am taking this on a walking tour of Montreal. Excellent customer service as well. Great personal touch.
5,It took a while for me to decide whether to buy this backpack or not. And I wish I didn't. It's durable I love the color and for the price? You can't go wrong. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,this pack is everything I was looking. As A regular traveler and walker ( for groceries etc.)  the lightness in weight of the pack and the size is everything I was wanting when I made the order
5,Love this backpack - my son uses it for grade 1
5,Great little backpack. It's used daily to get me to and from work.The colour is exactly as shown.
4,Good solid bag for the price you really can not go wrong and the cool thing about this it comes with a one year warranty which is a nice bonus. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a nice budget bag.
4,The amazon return policy ran out onSept 30 it is now Oct 9 and I am stuck with a backpack with two broken zippers. UPDATE Vaschy contacted us and have sent us a new one I am impressed that they care enough to check there reviews and do something about it.  Thanks Vaschy! I have a happy daughter again!
2,Expensive for what it offers

5,I love this backpack. The zippers are quality and don’t get stuck. I love the colour and all the pockets inside. The upper mesh pocket is great for all my access passes.

4,Me gustó q tiene varias bolsas para guardar lo que quieras lo que no me gustó es que se le pega un poco el pelo de gato pero fuera de eso es buena la calidad
5,This is an absolutely amazing backpack. What I have noticed is that the only difference between this bag and the Herschel Co. Backpacks that go for $80 and above is the Company name and the writing on the white square logo. This company shows a lot of care for their customers. When I opened the backpack i noticed a folded plastic back with the name Vaschy printed in black which I thought was pretty neat. The backpack also came with a card that said Thank You and stated that customer satisfaction is highly valued to them and this bag also comes with a 1 year warranty. Al in all very good backpack with several compartments. Huge thumbs up from me and I wish the best of luck for the Vaschy Company.
4,Excellent
5,Un bello zaino ben rifinito con molte tasche comode . Originale il design col bicolore

5,Very nice strong and big bag. It came with a “new bag smell” but it’s gone after a couple of weeks.
4,Still in a good state despite the heavy weight of the contain.
1,way too small. had to return it back
2,Herschel copy cat. Bad quality
5,Nice bag
5,Great
1,Don’t buy
5,Perfecta es de buena calidad tiene un montón de cremalleras por dentro para que no vaya todo suelto y es impermeable q para cuando llueve 👌 es para un regalo y creo q le encantará.
5,Zaino ben fatto lo consiglio di acquistarlo
5,Die Tasche ist super hat innen noch mal ein paar extra Fächer mit Reißverschluss. Für mich top da ich oft blindlings in die Tasche greife und so nicht ins falsche Fach gerate und mich wunder warum ich nicht das ertaste was ich eigentlich suche :DSieht außerdem sehr schlicht aus bzw. wirkt nicht kindisch oder "Schuljungen-mäßig"
4,Los compartimentos interiores están muy bien
5,I've been using this backpack for 2 months for commuting to/from work on a bicycle and also for the gym and it's held up really well. It's lightweight and really versatile with the many pocket combinations. The water bottle pockets on either side of the bag aren't suitable for really big bottles but they're handy for other things anyway. I got caught in some heavy rain for an hour cycling home recently and the waterproofing held up really well nothing seeped through or got wet inside so I was thoroughly impressed (I did treat it with a waterproofing spray when I bought it just in case). Only downside I've found are the leather tabs on the zips often unlooping themselves or slipping off but to be honest the zip works fine so it is just a superficial thing.
5,Farbe Form Gewicht sind oK
5,Item as described. Pleased with the quality.
5,My daughter loves it. It’s a replacement for the old one- the same brand just different colour!
5,Größe genau wie vorgestellt.
5,I decided to get a new bag as I am starting college in a few months and needed something for my books and stationary. Very quick delievery and lovely item-looks very stylish. Decided to get one in my favourite colour purple. It is very light and the straps are not too tight. Can't wait to use it at college.
4,Not as waterproof as it states. However very useful bagpack lots if compartments to keep your things organised can fit so much in the bag despite its size.
5,Ich liebe diesen Rucksack!Ich verwende ihn für die Uni - es passt wirklich alles sehr gut hinein da es ein großes Fach gibt (Laptop Bücher Getränk etc). Dann hat man innen noch weitere kleine Fächer und Unterteilungen zum Teil mit Reißverschluss und Sicherheitsnetz - ich finde das sehr gut da es in Rucksäcken sonst oft schwierig ist eine gute Ordnung beizubehalten.Vorne gibt es ein größeres Außenfach für Kleinigkeiten die man schnell mal zur Hand haben möchte. Ich würde jedoch nicht empfehlen die Geldtasche da hineinzugeben wenn man beispielsweise im Bus stehen muss da der Reißverschluss außen nicht wirklich gut gesichert ist und man eventuell einfach beklaut werden kann. Mit den Innenfächern ist man da besser aufgehoben! ;) Oder man verwendet den kleinen Haken der im Vorderfach eingebaut ist um zB die Geldtasche da dran zu hängen - dann kann auch nichts gestohlen werdenDie beiden Seitenfächer außen sind nur mit Klettverschluss zu schließen - ich finde sie eignen sich gut für Regenschirm Trinkflasche oder irgendwelche Kleinigkeiten.Der Tragekomfort ist außerdem sehr gut die Größe passst für mich optimal und ich finde auch dass der Rucksack sehr cool aussieht.
5,Muy práctica. Buen tamaño
5,My daughter loves it.
5,Schöner geräumiger Rucksack mit sehr guter Verarbeitung alle Reisverschlüsse funktionieren sehr gut und sind auch dicht.
2,This bag is a good bag except for the fact all the dye from the stripes has completely ruined my good coat all along the arms not once but twice. If you do decide to buy this bag please please wash it multiple times until the dye stops coming out because it will ruin your clothes
4,Ist ein schöner und für den Preis gut verarbeiteter Rucksack. Leider wird er derart zusammengefaltet geliefert - man kann schon fast sagen vakuumiert. Deshalb musste der Rucksack für mehrere Tage mit alten Zeitungen komplett ausgestopft werden. Nur so war es möglich alle Falten herauszukriegen... Sonst alles Top!
5,Perfect size fits alot in and is comfy to carry round
4,Seit einem Jahr ist der Rucksack täglich im Gebrauch. Die Größe ist gut. Entgegen meiner Erwartung ist er immer noch intakt. Er wird von einem Jungen genutzt.... 😉Das Preis Leistungs Verhältnis ist gut.
5,Bought for daughter for school she is very happy with the bag
4,Ich mag diesen Rucksack. Er ist groß genug um viele Bücher Laptop Block Taschenrechner Mäppchen Flasche unterzubringen. Leider sind die seitlichen Taschen etwas zu schmal um wirklich eine dicke Flasche reinzustellen. Diese lässt sich dann aber für Regenschirme oder Brillenetui auch praktisch nutzen.Ich würde ihn weiter empfehlen! Das blau ist sehr schön.
5,Great backpack for the price- love the pockets and just the right amount of space. For me 30L backpacks are a bit too big so this is perfect for carrying my notebooks lunch phone and portable charger as well as other things like purse keys etc. Only downside is side pockets are a bit small for a normal water bottle but I can fit this in the main section anyway; as a whole I love the bag a lot.
5,Lo zaino è molto bello e ben fatto è capiente ed ha molti scomparti poi sembra anche abbastanza robusto poi lo resterò. Per adesso sono molto contenta del mio acquisto!
5,Llevo desde el curso pasado con ella suelo llevar el ordenador cuaderno estuche y demás cosas de clase y no se ha estropeado nada asique genial!No es impermeable del todo pero bueno... siempre suelo llevar el ordenador con su funda asique si entra un poco de agua no importa aun asi mejor llevar paraguas.
5,Sehr tolles Aussehen mit viel Platz. Geeignet für Schule Arbeit und Freizeit. Mit 1 Jahr Garantie sogar
4,Acquistato per la scuola media buon prodotto si presenta robusto e capiente per i libri scolastici
5,Brilliant
5,Ob für die Schule  Arbeit oder den Einkauf  dieser Rucksack hält fast allem stand ! Kann sehr viel Gewicht tragen ohne zu reißen  wenn es regnet sollte man schnell sein aber der Stoff saugt nicht sofort alles auf  einen Waschgang in der Waschmaschine hat er auch gut überlebt! Klare Empfehlung! Mittlerweile schon 3 Jahre alt und in Nutzung.
5,Fantastic school bag my daughter loves it great size good durable and even water resistant very happy.Would definitely recommend
5,Love everything about it
5,Mochila práctica y bonita. A mí hija le ha encantado. Ahora a ver el resultado.
5,Cercavo uno zainetto non troppo voluminoso per tutti i giorni che potesse contenere Laptop libri e vari documenti. Mi posso ritenere soddisfatta.  Il tessuto è abbastanza robusto. Le cuciture a distanza di qualche mese dall'acquisto stanno reggendo bene. I colori tengono bene e non sono sbiaditi. Niente di speciale ma nel complesso uno zainetto che rispecchia bene il rapporto qualità prezzo e che fa anche la sua figura.
5,Daughter loves how light this backpack is. She loves it!
4,Zaino molto comodo
5,worth to buy
5,Very roomy and looks classy (intended for university student and fits the bill perfectly- 14” laptop fits effortlessly even inside is protective case; room for a ring binder A4 pad big pencil case a reading book a lunch box and smaller bits).  Useful zipped internal pockets for added safety.
5,Einfach super hochwertiges Material und perfekte Grösse. Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen!
5,I love it
5,brought for my granddaughter who needed a new one she is happy with it
5,Ein sehr schöner und robuster Rucksack. Meine Tochter nimmt ihn für die Schule. Er ist sehr praktisch durch die viele kleine Fächer vorallem die Seitentaschen eignen sich prima für die Trinkflasche und oder einen Regenschirm. Des Weiteren finde ich die Verstärkung unten am Boden sehr gut vorallem wenn man den Rucksack mal ins Nasse abstellt  Dieser Rucksack sitzt gut am Rücken und die Qualität ist weitaus besser als ein derzeit angesagter Markenrucksack. Wir würden ihn sofort nochmal kaufen.
5,Great rucksackGreat sizeGreat styleGreat sizeVery happy with it
5,Daughter loves it
5,A lovely bag perfect to put all my stuff in for work and a little bigger then what I thought it was going to be so it's great for me

5,Ein sehr schöner Rucksack
5,Habe ihn für einen Städte-Trip gekauft. Das große Fach bietet genügend Platz für Trinkflaschen und Verpflegung in den kleinen Fächern lassen sich viele Kleinigkeiten verstauen. Das Material ist fest und wirkt sehr robust aber gleichzeitig nicht steif so dass der Rucksack im leeren Zustand nicht wie ein Kasten aussieht.Der Rucksack kam sehr schnell an und entsprach genau der Abbildung.
5,Perfectmy daughter loves it!
1,Ordered the purple for school use but colour of motif at the top of bag completely different from the lovely purple colour at the bottom of the bag. It was faded and dull and didn't match. Not as advertised. So disappointed as have ordered from Vaschy before. Have to return and still no school bag!
5,Excellent. Bought it for my daughter to use at high school. Very well made.
5,Love it... my son's school bag and it's going to last ages it's brilliant quality with loads of compartments. 😀

5,Muy buena calidad buen precio
1,Es stinkt einfach so sehr nach Chemie auch nach 2 mal waschen werd ich den Geruch nicht los. Leider schlecht
4,I like how durable the material feels I am happy with the  numerous amount of storage/ pockets. I only just bought this item so I dont know how it stands up to water yet. It is simple elegant and functional.
5,The bag is spacious with lot of pockets. The material is also surprisingly fantastic.
2,Il est top
5,Très beau et durable. Ma fille l'a utilisé toute l'année plus quelques semaines de l'année scolaire précédente et le sac est encore super beau et pas de signes d'usure. Elle va pouvoir l'utiliser encore l'année prochaine.
1,Was smaller than advertised and can’t return it now.
5,Very grateful I can obtain a backpack like the 'big brands' without a 'big' price tag. Despite its price quality is excellent. Very durable. My only wish is bigger bags are made with a zip but this is great for most of my needs.
5,good bag short term use thus far without issuesfeels to be made of good quality material.fits 13" laptop easily.does what its supposed to do.
5,Super bueno!!! No le.pude tomar foto porque la regale pero.ed exactamente igual a las imágenes de su promoción
5,Très belle couleur et grand format avec beaucoup de poches ! Un coup de cœur ♥️
4,The backpack was as expected not too expensive lightweight and comfortable. Looks good too. Fits a laptop book and some other small items. Happy with the purchase.
5,Wanted one of these all my life because they look so cool I got the camo and love it
5,my wife who was my girlfriend at the time I bought it for her she still uses it! good quality which lasts so long.
5,C’est le deuxième sac identique que j’achète pour mon garçon. Il l’aime! Le premier il l’a eu au moins quatre ans et il voulait le même.
5,Very well made! Thin and light
5,La mochila es un poco más pequeña de lo señalado pero es resistente tiene una gran variedad de bolsas para todo tipo de objetos y me sirve para llevar mis libros audífonos paraguas y un termo mediano
5,que le cabe todo lo que llevo para la escuela
3,La calidad de producto no es gran cosa.
5,The product is great but the warranty and customer service is spectacularaand that is so much more important.  My 10 year old broke the zipper on his two year old book bag I emailed Vaschy to see about warranty we have a new book bag in hand within 3 days.  I can't imagine better or faster service.  1000% would recommend this product.
4,This is a great backpack. We did have an issue with it tearing on the inside after only a few months but the company was great to deal with and sent out a replacement backpack immediately. I recommend this backpack
5,Looks great feels awesome dosnt feel cheap and lots of room
2,3eme année scolaire . Le tissu est de qualité et résistant à l’eau. Ne tache pas facilement mais les zippers ont lâché après 2 semaines utilisation normale d’une fille de 8ans.
5,This backpack is amazing! I tested it waterproof and spacious. Would reccomend!
4,Se siente resistente y tiene varios compartimentos por dentro aunque es un poco más alta que las mochilas promedio
5,Realmente cumple con lo que es !
5,Ordered this backpack for my elementary-aged child to use as a school bag.  It's quite roomy with lots of room inside for what a child would need to carry for school including space for a lunch box snowpants library books etc.  I like the water bottle pockets on each outer side as well and the zippers slide easily which is perfect.  My only question is whether it will hold up to the test of being thrown around every day by a 7-year-old!  I'll try and update after a few months!Update:  bought this 4 months ago and so far it has held up very well even with daily use!  No fraying zippers still working still looks nice and new and holds its shape well.  This was a very good buy especially considering the reasonable price.
5,I received the backpack on time. It looks much better than in the pictures you can keep all your main stuff and your laptop is very well protected. Definitely I'm glad to decide to buy it.
5,me gustó mucho la volvería a comprar.
5,I absolutely love this bag it has so much storage. I especially love the little hook for keys in the front pocket because I used to always loose my keys in my bag. I haven’t tried out this bag yet for school it hasn’t started yet. It does seem very durable though and is made out of a very strong material. I also love how theres a ton of little pockets in the main area theres so much space for books binders papers etc. I really like how the bottom of the bag is made out of a material that is known not to rip. In the past there would just be a fabric material on the bottom of my bag and it would rip and tear. This is the perfect bag for school or any other needs for a bag. I would honestly even recommend this more than any popular brand bags like roots Adidas etc. This bag is 100% worth the money. :)
5,The Backpack came out  a little lighter than on the picture but i dont mind it. the backpack will help keep all your things in the right place. I love this backpack
5,I don’t write reviews but it was great. Came fast cute everything I needed from it with good packaging
5,My son loves it. Good for the price! The side pockets though should be deeper.
5,Was exactly as expected great quality.
5,I mostly use this backpack for carrying my MacBook  and notes for uni. And for times when I need to stay overnight for a trip this bag has enough space and compartments to carry all my extra stuff like clothes and tech accessories. Would recommend this bag!
4,A gift for an active grandson and I believe it will meet the challenge! The rucksack is made from a close-woven heavy fabric with padded back areas and rubber-tabbed durable zippers for easy gripping and pulling. There are many compartments and the interior is quite roomy. I'm pleased with the camo pattern and the overall size is very versatile/practical for a youth or adult. The description was very accurate I'm not disappointed in any way. It arrived on time nicely packaged and in good shape. The quality of the bag is well worth the price. Thank you. Joanne M
5,I bought this a couple year ago to use as a cute backpack diaper bag for 2 kids. It was perfect for outings and had many compartments inside. I really wanted something with 2 places for water on the outside so that was great. When the kids got bigger and I didn't need as much space my husband took it to use as a laptop bag for work. I had washed it on gentle in the washing machine and laid flat to dry several times to keep it clean and fresh looking. Would 100% recommend !
4,Happy with this backpack! It’s nice and compact. We got a large zipper binder for our daughter and was worried it wouldn’t fit but it fits comfortably. The water bottle pockets would fit a thin water bottle but is a little snug for larger ones.
1,This is the most horrible backpack ever! Not durable or strong and the arms are not adjustable properly. Do not buy!
5,Excelente producto calidad resistente color vibrante tamaño adecuado la parte de abajo es de un material mas resistente el color es muy bonito ( yo compre la amarilla ) le encanto.
5,Me encanto el color. Y el material de calidad de la mochila la use para mi hija de secundaria y le encanto  se ve resistente.
3,Decent backpack. I wish it was a bit larger. The white tag looks tacky too
5,It’s a pre good book bag just wish it was a bit bigger but it’s is fine for being in school
5,Es color es muy bonito la mochila de perfecto tamaño discreta pero perfecta para que mi lap entre sin problemas al ser de 15.6'' lo cual es bueno.
5,Worth the price
5,Great for school!  A lot of room!
5,Like an early morning sunrise on a farm this bag is just like home.
5,I bought this for my grandaughter for back to school.  It is water resistant and very durable.  The shoulder straps are comfortable.  Great value for the money.  It came sooner than expected.
5,Ma fille aime beaucoup le sac . Beau confortable  sur les épaules.  On a eu un matin de pluie et le sac m'a paru imperméable.
5,Great backpack overall. The leather tags on the zippers aren’t the best they easily fall off. Other than that small misfortune it is great for storage. Many compartments. Light weight and fits what I need.
