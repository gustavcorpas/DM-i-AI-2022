5,Alright first off these speakers are amazing. They sound crystal clear and get very loud. They are definitely omni directional so of course point toward you. This picture is of course after installing before I've finished my garage renovation. I've since completed the garage. Picture is months later but was one of the few that I had that included the speakers.These speakers are awesome and everyone who hears them ask about them everytime. Yes they are pricey that's no doubt. But I really enjoy music when working on stuff and just sitting around. I listen to edm and sounds amazing. I've had people stop on my dirt road and ask about them. Can clearly hear them 50 ft away at a decent volume. You want a party and these bad boys will bring it. Link with a good amp and your good to go. I of course could have gone another direction since most use more outdoors but I weld and paint in the garage so I didn't want to worry about them getting dirty and causing issues.Purchase if you get a chance. Believe me I see why people said that in other reviews and I know understand
5,These are great  perfect for my backyard and the clarity is sweet! Love Em!
5,Really made the back porch boom after the install love them!
5,Sound : 5 stars ( great bass which is what i was looking for on my outdoor speakers)Size : 3.5 star (they are big boys)Installation : 5 stars
5,Personally there's nothing not to like about a klipsch product ( preference ) we did think it ll be too big for our porch but the size of our porch solve that by " its just the right size" grt product.
5,Struggled like most to decide between these or the Polk Atrium 8s. So ordered both and hooked them up side by side. Pushing them with the Yamaha 200w receiver (the popular $200 one). The Klipsch were noticeable clearer and bass was significantly better. Klipsch packages them better in the box over Polk (my Polks had small dings in the grills because of poor packaging). The Polks do seem like the housings are better made if you need a true outdoor speaker that will be exposed to the elements. The Polks sounded good but these sound great!
5,A little background...I'm a music fanatic and I have music playing all around my house (we have acreage) as well as inside. I have bought many different outdoor speakers over the years. I have some el-cheapos I have a set of the old style Bose 151 Environmentals that are not bad for small speakers I have a set of Polk Atrium 45's that are excellent small outdoor speakers. I also had a set of Polk Patio speakers for my pool and patio area. They blew last weekend so I needed some new ones and I wanted some really great ones. After doing some research I was torn between these the larger Polk Atriums and the Definitives. I think they would all be fine speakers but I am a Klipsch fan and I liked the look of these so I placed my order. I received them today and have been playing them for about 4 hours. At first they sounded a bit hollow. But after about 30 minutes of play time they started smoothing out. Wow these sound great. The base response is the best I have heard from outdoor speakers. I have weatherproof subs that I built but I turned them off to see how these sounded without them and the bass is pretty impressive. But where these really shine is where all Klipsch speakers shine...the clarity of the mids and highs. They are crystal clear and sounds like guitar and horns project from the horn tweeters far better than you will get from most speakers. They are bright but not too bright. Some extra brightness is usually needed outside anyway because it's a wide open area. And these fill the bill perfectly. On my last speakers I had to run the treble at +6 and the bass at +3. I have the bass at 0 and the treble at +1 on these and they sound much better than the Polk Patios did. I can sit all the way on the other side of the pool and hear every little nuance of the music I'm playing. No kidding...this system sounds far better than most indoor systems!I will update after I've played these for a month or so but so far I am loving them. I suspect they will only get better. Can't wait for the next pool party where I'm sure to impress my guests with the sound.Good listening!Update-They are probably fully broken in now and they sound better than ever. The clarity of these they way they bring out the highs and mids is nothing short of breathtaking As mentioned above; I have two outdoor subs I custom built to withstand the weather and together with these speakers I have an outdoor system that will shame 95% of indoor stereo systems. I've had people over a couple of times since installing these and they are absolutely amazed at the quality of sound in my back yard. Good thing I have some acreage or my neighbors would hate me.As long as these hold up and I think they will given who makes them; they are premier outdoor speakers. If you want the best buy these.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2nd Update-It's the end of October now and I'm setting out on my deck enjoying the mild weather and listening to my sound system. The accuracy and clarity of these speakers is nothing short of stunning! It's such a pleasure to be able to sit outdoors and still enjoy audiophile grade sound. These speakers are worth every penny of what I paid for them. I'm enjoying them very much and I still highly recommend them to anyone willing to pay a little more for true quality.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update - Six years later these are playing as beautifully as the day I bought them. Still amazingly well balanced and accurate and that horn loaded tweeter is still cutting through the great outdoors. Our guests still comment on how great the system sounds.  These are not cheap but they are the best. They sound amazing and they last.  You can either buy these once or buy cheaper speakers several times.I just wanted to circle back almost seven years later and proclaim that I still love these speakers! They have been outside for the entire time even survived my wife pressure washing them (she meant well) and they still sound as amazing as when new.  Though the bass response is respectable I run them with two outdoor subs I built and the sound quality is spectacular! And being outside that is a strong statement!  Everyone who comes over (we entertain a lot in the back yard) is amazed at the sound quality!No they aren't cheap but you get what you pay for.  Just buy them and you'll love them for many years same as I have.
4,The speakers are amazing!  No complaints.  But they don't come mounting hardware???
5,Excellent quality for very reasonable price.  This is my second pair purchase!  The sound is full and balanced well-very clean crisp highs and base tones are deep enough to handle classical piano notes of George Winston or some heart pounding Metallica.I’m using a 2 channel 100 watt Yamaha amplifier(Bluetooth) for outside deck(300 soft)yard( 1 acre plus) speakers are mounted 24’ apart/12’ off ground.  At very moderate to high volume the sound is pretty damn good- again very well balanced with no distortion or vibrations.My first pair of these same Klipsch have been dedicated to a indoor setting in a finished basement bar area with 9 ft ceilings (600 sqft).  I’ve had them for 3 years and they rock/ same amplifier.  They produce big time!!!As for these (my second pair) that I just installed outdoors in our Maine home we shall see how well they handle the punishment of the UV wind rain ice snow and evil cold being exposed.On the front of our house we installed the Polk Atrium 6- which is a much smaller speaker for the same price as these ($285-ish) however decent sound.  The Polk Atrium 8’s ( which are more similar to these Klipsch in cabinet size/ spec/ performance) are $250+ EACH nearly double the price!!  I will say our outdoor Polk speakers are mounted on the Northwest side of our house that gets the worst winds for over 3 years now and they have handled the punishing Maine winter weather extremely well so far.  The Klipsch difference in sound quality in my opinion is significant for my sound applications so far; The cabinet is deeper so the bass is very clean and the horns are noticeably crisp. Hopefully these outdoor Klipsch will fair the weather conditions as well.  In the event they run into trouble I can only hope that the company backs their product like they attest to in their product disclaimers.  We shall see.I can only hope that my review will help some folks decide.  Knowing the quality performance of these I just cannot see a terrible risk laying out $285 to complete what I feel is a solid outdoor entertainment system.
5,I looked at the Polk Audio as I had purchased a set and wanted another set for outside. I got a popup saying the Klipsch was cheaper and since I have plenty of Klipsch indoor speakers I thought I couldn't go wrong. The speakers are bit larger and heavier than the Polks. Make sure you can securely hang them. As with all Klipsch speakers the horn tweeters are just fantastic! Cut thru and can be heard for a long ways away. If you are looking for "thump" in your bass then I suggest the Polk Audio as they have a boomier bottom end but you just can't beat the clarity of the Klipsch. Glad I made the purchase and would recomend to anyone looking to mount speakers outside or on a wall inside.
