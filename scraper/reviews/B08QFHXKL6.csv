5,Very satisfied with my new TOMLOV digital microscope. It is very user friendly and high quality for the price. I'd recommend this product for beginners and novices for viewing coins jewelry making and everything in between.
5,Best of the bunch!
4,My only issue was/is connecting to chrome book and or my laptop I was unsuccessful in both attempts. So as of now Iâ€™m only able to view on the 4.5 screen which had a great picture
3,I ordered this microscope last week and immediately put it together and started using it.  Unlike other reviews my purchase came with instructions.Bottom line is this is an inexpensive microscope and I guess I'm getting what I paid for.My comlaints:1.  The who LED display is not in focus.  I can focus on what I am looking for but the rest of the display is blurry.2.  The LED screen is not adjustable.  When sitting on my desk (I use this for coins) my chair is too low to see the display at exactly 90 degrees so I get that view you used to get when looking at older TV sets from a side view.  If the screen was just slightly adjustable problem would be solved.  As of now I have to almost stand up to see the display clearly.3.  There is a separate USB to be used for using the ancillary lights.  Why?4.  Although the ancillary light adjustable poles worked better for me than on most of the bad reviews of this product they were still too flexible to stay where I wanted them.  I just have to work around this and bend them where I think they will do what I want them to do.  Also although their brightness is adjustable I just kept getting white splotches on the LED display when I had them on.  I don't use them anymore.Does this product work?  Yes.  Do I wish I spent an extra $100 to buy a better product?  Yes.
