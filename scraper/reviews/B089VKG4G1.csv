5,Accidentally dropped a one year old I-Pad open and it hit a marble floor on it’s edge resulting in a significant splaying crack across the entire width of the I-pad.  At the bottom right edge where if hit the floor multiple pieces of glass were fragmented bulging and ready to splinter out secondary to no integration with the remaining surface of the glass.  Luckily the internal function of the I-Pad remained intact.I immediately called Apple and found out it would be close to $600 to repair.  I felt this was ridiculous and immediately got on Amazon and ordered this screen protector.  Arrived the next day and put it on not as the directions stated to center it because the screen was larger than the protective glass dimensions.  I placed it right up to the metal curve in the frame in the lower right scorner and pressed down the irregular raised fragment.  Worked like a charm.  Now have a solid glass surface and on touch feels like the original smooth screen.. it is a very solid repair. Obviously you can still see the stellate cracks but it is really not an issue. The  I-Pad functions like new and I could not be more pleased.  I can’t guarantee it but I hope this is the last time I drop my I-Pad!!
5,My husband forgot he left his ipad on the top of his truck.  This is what the screen protector looked like after falling while he was probably going 55 down the road.  This along with a ZUGU case and no damage to the ipad whatsoever!  Case was fine and just had to replace the screen protector.  Would definitely buy again!
5,This has all you need to protect your IPad screen provided in the package. Easy to follow instructions included.
5,Seems like a nice quality for the cheap price
5,easy to install doesnt have glare that i notice at all and the touch is not compromised at all. great screen protector for the price and even comes with back camera protection. overall a good bargain!!
5,Llego en el tiempo PRESISO y muy bueno
5,I liked
4,First one had to get tossed because there were so many bubbles. I spent 15 minutes cleaning the screen and making sure there was no dust. Second installation went better with the bubbles but it's not aligned properly because they don't give you any guider other than a tiny little sticker which does nothing to help. Sucks that I only got one screen protector out of it Ill probably buy elsewhere next time because of it. Unless they were kind enough to read and respond to my review and send me out a replacement since one of them was ruined from bubbles on a "bubble free" installation.
4,Hasn’t stopped my iPad from not working right. Hasn’t broken yet. Send to be a good buy
4,My only negative was that I couldn’t install without bubbles.  Nice for anti-glare and no problem with touch screen. Would buy again.
