5,After my Sister's older computer gave out after many years of faithful service I gave her my Gateway FX6860 another great computer. She noticed though that whenever she connected to the Internet through Wi-Fi her connection on the PC slowed to a crawl. Her modem and router are located at the front of her home and her PC is located at the back end of the house.  I told her we could call her ISP and bump up the speed to her router but I would also add a new Wi-Fi card since the one in the Gateway was going on 9 years old. I found this replacement card (Archer TX3000E) on Amazon liked the features and reviews and decided to buy it for her. I liked the idea of the antennas being separate from the card in the PC so that they could be placed higher than the PC to better capture Wi-Fi signals.  The card and the drivers from the included CD installed with no problems and the card connected easily and quickly to my Sister's network. There was a noticeable speed increase. From the beginning to finish setup took approximately 20 or 30 minutes TOPS! This card is simple easy and quick to install setup and connect to a network.  The first thing I did was shut down the computer unplug the power and all other peripherals (mouse keyboard printer PC speakers monitor) placed the tower on its side and removed the side panel.  After touching the metal chassis to discharge static in my body (I forgot to grab my anti-static wrist strap at my home. Sue me) I removed the old Wi-Fi card.  I then used a flashlight to search for an unused USB_F header on the Motherboard. I found one. (NOTE: This is used ONLY for BLUETOOTH not Wi-Fi! You DO NOT need to connect the cable from the card to the USB_F header for Wi-Fi! The card will still work for Wi-Fi without it)! I decided to plug the cable in to give my Sister the option to have Bluetooth even though she didn't ask or needed it because ...Well why not? It's included for free! Might as well take advantage of it! I recommend you install the cable first because it will be a tight fit for your pudgy little digits (fingers!) if you install the card first.  I installed the cable into the card then installed the card into the available PCIe 1x slot.  I replaced the PC's side panel and plugged everything back into the back of the computer.  Next I booted the computer up and inserted the driver CD into the DVD optical drive. I was given the option to choose which driver(s) to install either just the Wi-Fi driver or or both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth each separately. I chose to install both. They installed easily for me with no problems at all.  It was now time to connect to my Sister's router. I RIGHT-CLICKED on the small globe icon down on the bottom right side of the Task Bar next to the time and date. (If you hover your mouse pointer over the globe icon it should inform you that you aren't connected to a network yet). After I right-clicked on the icon it showed me two options: 'Troubleshoot Problems' and 'Open Network and Internet Options'. I chose 'Open Network settings'. On the next Window I had to click on 'Show Me Available Networks'. It showed me available networks listed including the surrounding neighbor's networks. I chose my Sister's network clicked 'Connect' then added her router password. I was now connected to her network. (If you have any problems at this point be sure you are picking your OWN network  neither the neighbor's nor your GUEST network on your router and CHECK DOUBLE CHECK and RECHECK that you are typing your router password correctly! It may be case sensitive)!  Now it's a good rule of thumb to run computer hardware like Wi-Fi cards with the latest drivers from the hardware's Manufacture. Since the drivers I installed from the included CD were from Intel I went to Intel's website and installed their Intel® Driver & Support Assistant. It will search for ALL supported Intel drivers on your computer and update them automatically after you choose to download and install them. The Intel® Driver & Support Assistant found the LATEST drivers for both the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and installed them both! I HIGHLY recommend trying it out!  And that's it! My Sister now had a MUCH FASTER Wi-Fi connection! All in about 20 or 30 minutes TOPS!  Two other things I did just to help her Network connection be a little more quicker was I went into her computer's network settings and changed her DNS to Cloudflare: '1.1.1.1' and '1.0.0.1'. I also downloaded 'WiFi Analyzer' (olgor) from Google Play Store and installed it on my phone and analyzed her network signal (amongst her neighbor's signals). I wanted to make sure she had her own WiFi signal channel and make sure it wasn't "stacked" on the same signal channel or overlapping with her neighbor's WiFi signals. Nope her ISP who set up her Modem Router and Network gave her her own personal pure channel. Good job Guys!Hope this helps someone out there! I highly recommend this product!
5,A pretty great WiFi card for the price. I ordered this to replace my old WiFi card which was 802.11ac because I realized my router supported 802.11ax. Internet speeds were definitely faster by about 20-30%. Make sure your motherboard has a USB 2.0 header as many of the other reviews stated if you want to take advantage of the Bluetooth. Installation is a breeze; just plug it into a PCIe slot and use the supplied USB header adapter to plug into your motherboard. It was not plug-and-play for me and I don't have a CD drive to use the included driver disc. For my case I used my laptop to download the drivers from TP-Link's website into a flash drive in order to install it on my desktop. No big deal just had to be a little creative.Unfortunately for me I was still not getting a full gigabit internet connection like I would if I was hardwired into the router. I was getting about 600-700 mbps max. Many things do factor into this though i.e. distance how many devices are connected to the router or interference with other signals (if you live in an apartment like I do). I did notice that my local data transfers were faster which was great since I regularly share files between computers. This card will be going in another computer for now. Another thing I noticed was that initially my Xbox controller disconnected every couple of minutes in game when using Bluetooth. However this subsided after a day. I have no idea what I did but it stays connected consistently now.In conclusion I did set myself up for disappointment. WiFi technology has not quite yet reached the capabilities of pure hardwired ethernet which is fine! If you don't want to run ugly cables across your home and you want the best WiFi performance this card is perfect for you.
5,All I can say is wow.  I've had AC wifi for a few years now and just upgraded my Comcast gateway to the new 802.11AX (WiFi 6) and my signal has always been pretty weak across the house.  40Mbps on a good day with a 300Mbps connection.  Tried powerline ethernet and that delivered 30Mbps so that was a bust.  I knew AX had better range and a broader spectrum as well as 2.4 which has better range than 5Ghz.  I swap my old AC adapter out with this one (same brand just updated) and holy crap what a difference.  First speed test 140Mbps and full upload on 5Ghz.  Mind you the wireless gateway is probably 120' away and there's probably 5-6 walls in between as well as outside as the house is sort of L shaped and it is a BIG ranch home.  This thing is WORLDS better than anything 802.11 AC.  I am a fan of wifi AX that is for sure.  I can't even imagine how far the range on 2.4 is probably half way down the block...
5,When I built my PC I went with a FebSmart wifi card for about $30 which seemed like a good choice and had a lot of good reviews.  Boy was that a mistake.  I suffered with it for way longer than I should have having to endure a max of about 20 down and constant and very frequent drops in internet.This TP-Link is very fast by comparison; my speed test says I'm getting about 290 down.  But the main thing that I love about it is the consistency.  My internet just went out (router issue not the card) and I go "huh that hasn't happened in a really long time".  And I realized just how much of a difference in consistency there is between a good and bad wifi card and it inspired me to write this review
5,Thinking about buying the wall jack from TP-Link because cable is always better? Don't. Buy this wifi card and run a LAN->WAN with CAT6+ connection from your stock modem to a new wifi 6 capable router from Asus or Netgear or whatever is cool these days. My ping changed from 20-50ms to 4-10ms on a wifi card vs. my TP-Link wall connector that went straight to my router at "10gbs" (BS). I can utilize my entire (embarrassingly slow120Mb/s ×2DSL lines) internet connection bandwidth with this card at a better experience than the CAT5 in my walls to basement. This card is great though if you want faster search for wifi 6e capable or soon to be whatever confusing version is next 7 I assume.
5,Yes I said it. Installed the card didn't have a DVD/CD drive on this comp. So I had to copy the CD driver content to a USB stick for the install on my laptop.Got it installed and was expecting to see a TP-LINK AX3000 installed under device manager.But no I saw two Intel wifi network adapter installed. One for my existing onboard Intel Wireless-AC adapter and the newly installed Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX210 160MHz??Yea just get the barebone intel AX210 wifi adapter for half the price it has the same features. lolInstallation obstacle aside the card is as advertised.This is day1 we'll see in days to come.[UPDATE 2 months later] 9/27/2022The NIC is doing well no drops or disconnect using WiFi 5ghz signals.Was installed on my daughter's gaming pc. She plays Valorant which is a real-time sensitive game. She use to rage when that lag hits at the worst time during her gaming. One day I checked on her and she was running video feeds with 3+ friends discord music watching (1-2) twitch streams & playing valorant/minecraft all at once.  Talking about stress test...yes she's our wifi-bandwidth-hog.It's been a very noticeable improvement over her onboard NIC. She's loving it so far.Despite being a rebranded Intel NIC we will give this TP-Link NIC our stamp of approval!Buy it with confidence!
5,My old tp link pci Wi-Fi card would drop connection all the time. So I installed this and let me tell you. I felt like I was hard wire again. It was insane. Still no connection is better then hardwire but this Wi-Fi card definitely helps if you don’t wanna run wires all through your house and floor.
5,My daughter doesn't play the most intensive games but on her fairly new gaming PC we had some significant lag with the other wifi adapter.  This adapter has pretty much eliminated the internet/wifi lag issues we had.  Fornite and Seige Six and the like are the most intensive graphic games used and this adapter pairs nicely.  Its cool to be able to have the antenna on top of the box or hidden in the back.  Easy to install and only a few issues w/ drivers but plenty of online resources to get by those issues.
5,I recently purchased a Wi-Fi six router from TP Dash Link and I needed a network card that could tap into the new speed.This fit the bill and I love the external antenna I am now getting incredibly fast speed over wireless.Normally I would have used a hardline cable but because of how my house was made I have top caps in all of my walls that I would have to drill through with a $70 12 foot bit.So instead I spent $105 and now have fantastic speed with super ease.
5,Best value for your buck. You cannot beat this one. Compatible with Wifi6 and the price is very attractive. I've used this for over a year or two and never had any issues. Internet speed steady and reliable. Highly recommend it. I convinced my brother and cousin to buy the same model and they are also very satisfied since they had it last year.
5,First this is a PCI-E card. It is installed into your motherboard. This is not a "plug and play" device. Some reviews are talking about how hard this is to install. A quick YouTube tutorial will show you. It is simple but might be scary to people who aren't comfortable opening up their PC case.Second the drivers you need will be sent on a CD with the card. If you do not have a disc drive download the drivers PRIOR to installation OR have a LAN cable ready to download the drivers after install.After installing this my wifi reception went from 20/30 maps to 310/40 (download/upload). It works well and is likely a great addition to your PC.
5,I just moved to another place and the router is pretty far away from my PC. This is the reason my network jitter spikes and I got lag in the game. Decide to replace my USB wifi adapter with this and everything is going smoothly so far.
5,FAST to install affordable and works perfectly right off the bat. Is rather small and doesn't stand out. Have ordered more for the rest of my roommates have had zero wifi issues
5,I haven’t gotten the Bluetooth to work but I’ve had the card for 2+ years and it works great
4,It doesn't say it in the description but this card must be connected to a usb header on the motherboard. For me this meant disabling one of my front case ports. This should be mentioned in the item description.I like the magnetic antenna but I wish the cable for it was a bit longer (it is about 1 meter or 3 feet long).
5,I ordered this to allow a PC in a room where no ethernet existed and it's on the second floor of a 4500 sqft. house. I could get 800Mbps download over the Wifi and 18ms ping to the internet I am very pleased with the speed and features.
5,Easy Install and the Bluetooth works with my ps5 controller! Couldn't have asked for a better product at the price.
5,Had this for a couple years now and no issues at all. As long as your motherboard has a PCI-e slot and a free USB header install is fairly straight forward. Don't bother with the CD that is included. If you are using Windows 10 The wifi driver will auto install when you turn it on. Once you are connected to your network go to WIndows Update click on Check for Updates and then click on Optional Updates and install any wifi or Bluetooth drivers that show up there. Once those are installed you should be good. I have never contacted tech support so I can't say anything about that but I have installed this on two different Windows 10 desktop PCs and it has worked great on both.
5,This has been the best sum of cash I've ever spent. Upgraded from an AX1200 to this and am quite literally achieving over 10x the speed I was getting before. Went from 30 - 40mb up/down to 330 - 400mb without having even moved my PC. I'm upstairs and across the house from my WiFi router. When downstairs and across the house I achieve the full 1gb up/down I'm allotted.
5,Easy setup have amazing connectivity & speeds without any issues.
5,Great product. Have it at the dorm and no issues!
5,This is a great wifi card for the money.  Installs easy.  Reminder for anyone adding hardware to a computer be sure to get the driver installed first. Then disconnect power supply install and reconnect power and turn on.  The system should find the new hardware and boot it right up.  As you can see in the photo I am getting anywhere between 600 and 800 download speed.Best wifi card Ive ever installed!!
5,I wrote a previously negative review for this item due to poor speeds and horrid performance but upon updating the drivers from the ones on the included dvd which appear to be old and tweaking the device in my device manager on windows I got the card to achieve speeds upwards of 300 mbps. Definitely a lack of thorough investigation on my part and seems like a pretty good purchase so far. I am getting great speeds now.
4,While the product's specifications and performance while it works is great there is one big caveat; it's only great while it works.  There is a problem that is long-standing and unresolved with this card.  Any time the computer goes to sleep regardless of having the most recent drivers BIOS and other updates this card does not itself wake from sleep.  This card is either not detectable by the computer requiring a restart to re-enable or you might be able to run the troubleshooting wizard to reinstall the driver and then reinitialize the card.This is a very irritating problem and I recommend avoiding this card and looking elsewhere.UPDATE:  I found the problem.  The card apparently does not work well with an internal USB header expander.  I've since changed my hardware configuration and this card works as intended.
4,Works great but it was a definitely a returned item. No anti-static packaging. Was an open box and not disclosed.
5,The upload went from 20 Mbps to 40 Mbps and that's double the upload.The download went from 50 to 550 and that's 11 times the previous download!Download stays around 600 Mbps which is technically 12 times the previous download speed but I can't keep testing the internet speeds. The cable company I go through has monthly limitations; if we pass that limitation they throttle the connection.Note: This is a simplified multiple of 5 of the upload and download speeds and is not an exact measurement.
5,Fast Ship. Easy to install. Looks great in Red. This was a upgrade for my Motherboard. Great price !
4,So I bought this because like most others I can no longer hardwire my PC into my modem. So I figured this could be the next best thing. I was going to go w/ the 4 antenna setup but that'd add $50 more and the difference really wouldn't be noticed unless I had higher internet speeds from my ISP. I'm out of the city now and I'm coming from 1tb to 100mb. speeds :(.I have my PC in my office which is in a separate room from where the modem is. After installing and using the provided disk to install the drivers I had working internet! Yay. However I noticed I was missing 2 bars for 5ghz signal and 1 bar for 2.4. I thought this was quite weird given what the product claims it does. The signal is going through a couple of walls but it's only 1 room away. After playing a few games and doing what I used to my packet loss was really bugging me. I'd get some severe lag spikes and my DL rate was about 20mbps off from it being hardwired. So I messed around w/ the antenna trying to dial in the best connection and nothing really worked. So I made myself a long ethernet cable and ran a line anyway. The wife wasn't too happy about it but I told her it was for 'testing' reasons. This is how it was for the last week or so.Now I was excited to learn I get a blue tooth adaptor with this product too! Since I never decided to install one into my PC before. Which let me use blue tooth headphones instead of my bulky heavy gaming headset. Which I was honestly getting really tired of using. However my bluetooth signal would drop about once every 2 hours or so. I'd then have to go into the blue tooth settings and disconnect/reconnect the device to get it working again. I didn't think anything of it till a few hours ago when it happened after I rocked back in my chair. I figured it's disconnecting because the signal isn't that great. Which probably means the drivers that came on the disk are old. Now when I got the device I went to the website and the drivers there are listed as the same date/numbers as the ones on my disk. Today I decided to go into Device properties and work on the blue tooth drivers for the adaptor and see if I can update them. Unfortunately I couldn't but that lead me to the network adaptor and viola! I updated those drivers AND then I could update bluetooth. NOW I've been using the headset with no disconnections and my ping/bitrate is amazing! I'm getting late packets but no packet loss. My MBPS matches the hardwired speed and I'm not getting any spikes! So again this is a driver I did in the device manager of windows 10. I just had the OS find the drivers via web and it installed.TL;DR - Drivers on disk don't properly activate the device. After driver install go to Device manager (win 10) and update the drivers though windows. Perked my device up!
5,From my stock motherboard I was getting around 20mbs downloads on steam and now I get around 60-80 mbs. Lag in games is almost never on my end now. Though it was very difficult to install as you need to uninstall old drivers and disable them or the computer will crash everything on bootup.
5,I was originally using a cheap usb wifi antenna which was just to get started and I was experiencing some lag every once in awhile playing Overwatch. One of my friends recommended adding a wifi card to my motherboard and he was right! Installing this boosted my signal so theres no lag. The only thing that was a little confusing to me was the brackets they included for the back panel. If you can tell from the picture my stock ones have a tab that sit on top of the case and the bracket included for the card does not so I let it rest between the case and the mother board inside. That was confusing to me but it was also my first build. Anyways found it useful and relatively easy to set up.
5,I installed this internal adapter today.  I just switched from comcast xfinity (200 mbps) to verizon fios (1000 mbps gigabit).  It costs $15 more a month.  I got 30 down and 5 up from comcast - a no brainer.  After I connected to my new FIOS router on wifi I only got 30 down and 30 up.  So I researched wifi 6 adapters and I settled on the (archer TX3000E) tp-link AX3000 wifi 6 (wi-fi 6) internal adapter.  I found a bunch of reviews online and on amazon.  The product reviews from relatively trustworthy sources said it's a great adapter (I believe there are reviewers that will say anything to get a free adapter or to get paid by the vendor...).  I found a bunch of amazon reviews that that said "don't buy" it broke their computer badly and it stopped working days or weeks after installing it or it broke they computer.I have an HP Pavilion 590-p0xxx desktop computer.  I was concerned because some reviews said to make sure you disable the onboard wifi adapter before installing this adapter.  I spent two or three hours trying to find out how to disable my onboard wifi adapter in the BIOS.  I didn't find anything online or in the HP manuals for my model and I didn't have any luck search online.  There wasn't a setting for that in the hp bios settings (strange and sort of troubling).I held my breath put it in and it works great.  That almost never happens in my experience.  It install its own driver and I'm getting 600 mbps down and 150 mbps up.  I'm not sure why upload is so much slower than download.  The verizon lady said it's 1 gig down and 1 gig up.  I guess there's something about the design of the wireless protocol because I see the same difference on my lenovo thinkpad laptop.I didn't bother connecting the bluetooth cable to the adapter and plugging it into my motherboard.  My onboard bluetooth adapter works fine and I don't want to mess with it.  A few reviews warned about problems with using the adapter's bluetooth capabilities.  I taped the cable inside the cabinet in case I change my mind someday.I thought it was strange that there were no instructions in the box. I didn't need them but a less experienced person might.Finally I'm hoping the problems people had who said the adapter stopped working or ruined their machine to the point of having to rebuild it don't happen to me.
5,It was a refurb that appeared to be new. It worked from the very beginning and I've never lost a signal.
5,It is a great product. It was easy to install and it came with Bluetooth as well. When I bought it it connected in less than two seconds while I had one that was USB that took about a minute. I have Wi-Fi 5 but it’s still good because it backwards compatible. Also magnetic so I put it on the side of my pc
5,This card made a massive difference for my wifi connection to my desktop. I was using a USB ac1200 dongle and my speeds kept dipping lower over time. I also notice I would only top out at maybe 100mbps despite having a powerful enough router and fios gigabit.After installing this I instantly hit an average of 550mbps and no longer thought about running an ethernet line. I didn't even realize it had built in Bluetooth which worked better than my usb dongle for that as well.***Big thing to note - you need a free usb header connection on your motherboard for power. So double check that yours has one free.***Also to note - get a DVD drive to install drivers from the included disk. As soon as they were installed everything hit without issue. This was installed on a slightly older asus x470 pro with 0 issues. 100% would buy again
5,I recently bought my first wireless Bluetooth headphones to use with my older Windows 10 desktop computer vintage 2013 or so. I was disappointed in the sound quality; it was crackly with a lot of dropouts. But the same headphones sounded great when paired with my phone or tablet. So what was wrong?The problem was that my PC's integrated Bluetooth was only version 4.0 which doesn't support all the latest features that make newer Bluetooth headphones sound good. OK so problem solved -- just buy a Bluetooth 5.0 USB dongle.Problem is there's no such thing. There are a couple of low-quality products out there that claim to be Bluetooth 5.0 but after reading the reviews it looked doubtful. But! It turns out that PCIe wifi cards like this one have real  Bluetooth 5.0. So I sent off for one.It showed up the next day. I'd never bought TP-Link before and it is a Chinese brand but the build quality looked good when I unpacked it and the Bluetooth chip inside is a standard Intel chip that uses the standard Intel drivers. I followed the instructions carefully hooked everything up and it works great!Audio is much clearer now both in stereo headphone mode and hands-free headset mode. This is probably due to the external antennas as well as the Bluetooth upgrade.Things to look out for when installing it:1. It needs to connect to an F_USB plug on your motherboard in addition to sliding into the PCIe slot. The F_USB is a 9-pin Molex connector with the pins exposed -- it's not like a normal USB port you'd find on the outside of your computer. And if you don't connect this the Bluetooth won't work! In my case my motherboard had three F_USB connectors but they were all in use. So I unplugged one that went to some USB ports on the front of my computer that I don't need.2. If your computer already has Bluetooth you need to disable it in Device Manager. If you don't the new Bluetooth on the card won't be turned on properly when your computer starts. In my case I disabled the "Broadcom Bluetooth 4.0 Adapter" and restarted the computer. After this the new "Intel Wireless Bluetooth" showed as working properly (before that it showed as not working).3. On Windows 10 you don't need to install TP-Link's Bluetooth drivers from the CD or their web site. Windows will do this for you and the driver will be a newer version that way. If you install TP-Link's driver it will downgrade to an older version which you don't want.So anyway it was a great purchase and works exactly as expected it just takes a little care to set up properly.
4,The metal plate came bent but it works great and we fixed the slight bend.
5,This doubled my wifi signal! I was getting around 220 Mbps and not I get over 450! This was very easy to install and also came with a wire adaptor so I was able to use it with my PC properly. So excited to game now! :D
4,Just like some of the 1 and 2 star reviews states you do get BDOS but! with windows 10 if you let it restart itself after the bdos it will run a diagnostic mode. Let it run and fix itself and it will boot up correctly. All I had to do was install the newest driver for this wifi card and it worked like a charm with no hassle.I have 6 speed runs using Speedtest by Ookla. The first 3 avg about 150mbs down/10mbs up. The second avg 200mbs down/8mbs up. The first 3 test was peak hours between 6-7pm and the second test was at 9am. I do have an average of 4 device that are actively in use. I room downstairs and the router is upstairs. There is about 50 feet between the Archer TX3000E and the router.Install is easy for me. Its straight forward and comes with instructions inside the box. If you are buying this for your pc I am guessing you have to be somewhat tech savvy but even if you aren't there should be plenty of tutorials out here.My impression of this product is that I think the BDOS happens because of a conflict of drivers. Again if you let it fix itself then it will run like a charm. After installing it I ran the speed test right away. I have this cheap usb wifi that claims to be ac600 (which theoretically I should get 150mbs down on a strong connection) and the most I could get was 30mbs down/10mbs up. With the Archer TX3000E I get 3-4x more down speed. The Bluetooth connection is very strong as well. I can be in the kitchen (20 feet in the center) and turn on the microwave and still receive extremely strong connection. It doesn't cut my Bluetooth headset at all compared to my cheap Bluetooth adapter. I haven't bought a wireless card in a very long time but the fact that this has a heat sink to cool itself leads me to believe that it will get hot none the less its actually a good feature because it shows that the makers knows their product as well. I could recommend this for anyone living in a house built in the 2000s as the house I live in have thin drywalls but many rooms and walls between the Archer TX3000E and the router making this product easy recommendation if you can get pass the BDOS. I played an FPS game and had tremendous packet loss with the ac600 wifi usb. With the Archer TX3000E I haven't experienced any packet loss yet. I will keep this updated if there is enough people who request for any update.
5,Instant improvement to my wifi woes.  Easy installation and love the magnetic base and it really does grab a good strong signal
5,Good wifi card. Works great.
4,My product worked great until yesterday my 5G internet connection started to just disconnect and wouldn't reconnect.  I reset the router last night and the card worked until this afternoon.  No matter what I did the 5G would not work I kept getting 'can't connect to network".  The 2G worked fine but I need 5G.  I had purchased this 5 months ago. I finally dug out my back up wifi adapter a D-Link AC 1900 Ultra Wi-FI USB adapter.I tried to go through TP Link but I kept getting the round and round the automated chat.  Unfortunately they only do exchanges and they want you to troubleshoot first.I am working from home now and I need reliable a WiFi adapter that works.  The only reason I got this was to have blue tooth  and wifi on my computer.  I think I will get a separate blue tooth adapter.Edit as of April 2021:Here are some steps I have taken to fix this issue and things I discovered.I ordered the same type of product but different manufacturer but ran into the same problem so I sent it back for a refund.  Thanks Amazon.Last month I decided to reinstall this item back onto my on my computer so I could utilize the blue tooth on this card and I continued to use the D-Link AC 1900 Ultra Wi-FI USB adapter for my wi-fi needs.  But then I noticed when I checked under Settings-->Network & Internet -->Advanced Network Settings -->Change Adapter Options  the D-Link USB adapter would show disconnected and the TP Link  AX 3000 Adapter would show connected.  I would disable the D-Link and my internet would show connected through the TP Link AX 3000 Adapter.  However when I shut down my computer and start it up later I would have to use the D-Link  USB adapter to get Wi-Fi started and once it starts up at some time it switches over to the TP Link AX 3000 Pcie adapter.  Weird but then it continues to work until I shut down and then start up my computer later.  Weird.So I am increasing my review to 4 Stars since it does work most of the time it just does not seem to want to work when first starting up the computer.  So if you have an issue with this adapter not working initially try to dig out your old USB Wi-Fi adapter to get it started and then check to see if your computer has switched over to the TP card.  Otherwise it works fine for me.  It is a bit aggravating to go through this extra step but it seems to work.
3,The product was a good NIC for a few months until the WIFI side failed.  The BT continued to work great.  Upon calling tech support they had a LOT of trouble understanding that the product is an internal wireless NIC and not in fact a router.  once past that hurdle their solution was they wanted to email me instructions on troubleshooting methods instead of assisting over the phone.  This is not a helpful solution when in order to get the email I would first need a working NIC in my computer.
5,I live in an old house which is very difficult to wire for a LAN (plaster walls and heavy framing) so I am largely relying on wi-fi for my upstairs computer which is an old Dell Optiplex 760 that did not come with wi-fi built in. For years I used USB wi-fi adapters with mixed results. I figured this card would offer the advantage of connecting directly to the PCIe port and bypassing the USB bottleneck since the Optiplex is fitted with USB 2.0 ports as well as (two!) high gain antennas which I could place in a better location than the back of my computer up against the wall and under a heavy wooden desk. I also hoped using the Wi-Fi 6 protocol would help me get the most out of my new Fios router two stories below which is piping in 200 Mpbs.Good move! Besides providing all these advantages and excellent connection I also freed up a USB port that had been dedicated to a Bluetooth dongle because this card comes with Bluetooth too (easy to attach to the motherboard with the included 9-pin cable though I will admit I needed to cheat a little with an Internet search to make sure I knew what the port was supposed to look like) and also utilizes the latest protocols for that technology.The only thing that surprised me a bit but on reflection should not have was Zoom performance.  On the one hand it is GREAT in terms of resolution; better than you could ever imagine on a wi-fi connection much lesson with this antique Dell box which has a rather modest dual-core CPU and 8 GB of RAM.  On the other hand God forbid I open a browser during the Zoom session!  Zoom will blame the connection but don't believe it: it's the drain on your CPU diverting resources to the browser that had been happily powering this card.Solution not ideal was to set aside a browser with no extensions which are big resource hogs especially on startup for use during Zoom.  There is still stuttering during boot-up but they are shorter and more manageable. I do best when I fire up the browser before the session -- once it's running and pointed to the site I want to refer to during the call it's all good.Great purchase and worth every penny and a great upgrade for a hardware / configuration situation such as I have described.  Endorsed without reservations!
4,I guess it makes sense that you'd leverage a volume production M.2 wifi card in a PC which is exactly what you get with a TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000 PCIe WiFi Card (Archer TX3000E).  While there's a red aluminum heatsink covering it up that's all this card is... an M.2 socket wired up directly to a single PCIe lane.  The micro antenna leads are routed to mini-SMA connectors on the back of the card bracket (a low-profile bracket is included as well).  There external dual antenna block attaches to the mini-SMA jacks.  The antenna is good but not awesome - the mini-SMA connectors make it easy to bring your own better antenna.The software installation is pretty much as easy as the hardware installation.  The card was detected and installed on Windows 10 (version 2004) within a minute or so.  I tested the card with a Ubiquiti 802.11ac Wave2 WAPs (I didn't have an ax one handy).  GN and Chariot runs showed throughput that was clearly attenuated by the GigE port feeding the WAP... needless to say it was fast.So here's the problem: the Bluetooth adapter on the card requires you to use one of your motherboard's USB2.0 headers.  Why?  A single PCIe lane's bandwidth is WAY MORE than enough for both the wifi and Bluetooth's requirements.  Likely the answer is that the M.2 card doesn't support any bus arbitration and/or the card would require a host bus adapter glue IC.  Regardless it's a little weird to use that type of jumper cable in 2020.  You should have plenty of USB2.0 motherboard headers available but it's not great if you're trying to keep your cable management neat.Results matter though and the TP-Link AX3000 Archer TX3000E adapter works well.  The wifi and Bluetooth performance is pretty good and I don't think you are going to find significantly better than this at the price point.  Recommended
5,Item is of high-standard quality. Exceptionally good-looking packaging. Delivery was notably fast. Would buy from again.
5,Works just fine after you sort out the little caveat to installing it that i mention in my headline. Only complaint is this thing is kinda ugly to look at shouldve just painted it black imo.Also do yourself a favor and download the drivers for this thing prior to connecting it if you can as much as i like to tinker and build PC's having to richard around and reconnect onboard wifi then disconnect it so you dont BSOD endlessly yada yada just makes life easier.
5,My desktop is upstairs and on the polar opposite side of the house from the router which is downstairs. We have a gig internet and prior to this wifi card I was getting 15 mbps download speed out of our GIG internet. Absolutely dreadful.Once I plugged this bad Larry in my download speed shot up to over 400mbps.I was shocked. I hoped for some improvement but this was a completely insane jump.If you are questioning whether or not to this card don't.  Buy it.
5,This is honestly one of the best purchases you could make as a PC builder. Literally this cannot get anymore than perfect on a PC build. Not only is it placed clean within the motherboard but can even placed to be unnoticeable. The wifi signals are better than amazing Plus Now I can connect my PC to a TV and play all my steam games with a Xbox or PS5 controller with ease. A must have.
5,I have quantum internet in my home but unfortunately I live in the basement. Originally I had a coax adapter that connected to the router and the computer’s Ethernet port and it worked really well.However that recently stopped working. My original solution was using a realtec USB WiFi dongle but the speeds were deplorable. I had to prop my computer up using boxes (0/10 would not recommend) to get the dongle as close to my window as possible And even then my max speed was a lightning fast 1.5 MB/S. Yuck.This product interested me as a solution because of the wired antenna that could easily reach my windowsill and hopefully grab a better signal. After 10 minutes of installing the product on the motherboard downloading drivers and setting up the antenna my speeds now sit between 25 and 35 MB/S. Not Ethernet good but hoo boy what a difference. At least for my unique situation this product was exactly what I needed.Notes:The drivers come on a cd. If you are a member of modern society and therefore do not have an optical drive in your computer and especially if you have no internet (which seems likely given the fact you’re buying a WiFi adapter) I would recommend using a separate machine to download the drivers off the tplink website onto a flash drive. A quick google search for “archer tx3000e drivers” should bring you right there.This product requires you to be comfortable with computer hardware as you’ll be opening the machine and installing it yourself onto the motherboard. If you are not comfortable doing that call your friendly neighborhood basement dwelling nerd named John and ask him to help. I’m sure you have one.Edit 09/29/2020:After playing around with the bunny ears a bit I was able to get this to pick up my 5g signal all the way from the other side of the house and one floor up. I now have speeds of over 100mb/s up to as high as 130! Dear sweet newborn infant Jesus this thing is amazing. At this point it’s just as good as a wired connection would be.
5,Works well in windows 11. Install was easy. I just let Windows handle the drivers never used the driver disk. Speeds are good. I really have nothing negative to say about it. Haven't used the bluetooth but it appears to be working.
5,What can one say about a wifi card. Either it does the job or it doesn't. This one does and with a speedy transfer rate. Worth the purchase.
5,There is a room in the home that historically receives a poor signal when sitting with laptops and such.  But this item has overcome whatever obstacle was preventing the old equipment from doing the same.
5,have never used or needed wireless connection till now on a desktop pc. so when building my new pc i tried this. even though it had some very bad reviews i cannot find anything wrong with it. downloads are snappy and quick just like i was wired. i have ran 2 triple a games at the same time as well as downloading and many many open pages. i was trying to stress out the pc connection and resources. didnt even bog down in the slightest.so i bought a 2nd one. the 2nd one went in a 20 year old pc (old amd 4 core) repeated test didnt stutter. so i went nutty turned on 3 roku tvs and started movies. opened about 30 pages on each pc as well as running internet connected games and running obs and streaming. mother on another pc wired and my laptop on netflix.  i have no idea why ppl are having issues or maybe i won the lottery. to me this doesnt even sound possible and if i hadnt done it i wouldnt have believed it>>>>>"i did download on another pc and installed drivers before connecting to the net!"<<<<< after set up i logged onto the wifi and its been perfect. of course i dont try to stress the connection daily i just wanted to see where it would crap out... ermm it didnthonestly if i didnt know already and just started using this pc i would swear its hard wired to the net.i dont do this often and it would be my luck (trust me!) the sec i submit this review it will go batSh crazy. but right this sec as a first experience with a wifi/blue card.  I highly suggest you give this a try
5,This took 30 minutes from box to internet I had already every recent wifi driver installed due to Fenvi ax3000 that was garbage. Not alot of staggering with speed of down or up also mounted antenna to bottom of desk.Please don't skimp and buy one of the cheaper Chinese cards I wasted 7 hours on one of those because it wouldn't recognize at most pcie slots except a x16 and driver (error 10).
5,STORY: This was a huge upgrade for me. My room mates and I recently moved into a new house and the router is in the basement while my room is upstairs on the other side of the house I thought it wouldn't be a big deal since the house is less than 2000 sq feet. I'm running it off a net gear nighthawk AC1750 router. I used a ASUS Nano AC1200 WiFi-adapter for my desktop and the performance was horrible it kept dropping connections and would be extremely slow. Now with this I'm getting 100+Mbps with way stronger signal. That's the max our internet is rated at so I'm getting full speed on the other side of the house. I had to play around with the antennas a bit. Setup was super easy. You need drivers for it to work so I just used a hotspot on my phone since my PC doesn't have a DVD drive.Build quality: Seems very high nice stiff antennas and stand (although it's light so the cord could drag it) and the PCIE looks fairly good in the PC I kind of wish it was black though so it would match my build. But my GPU covers it regardless. Nice heatsink I never measured temps but I'm sure it's good.Wifi: Stronger than anything I have used.Futureproof: I don't have a wifi 6 router but I may upgrade to one in the future to take advantage of this deviceOther features: This also includes bluetooth which is super nice although I may not use bluetooth on my desktop it's a nice feature to have.Overall: It feels like my Asus AC1200 nano adapter was a ripoff because that was $40 while this is $50 and so much better. I wanted to save space but it ended up biting me. 100% worth it! I will be returning my other product.
5,My son is happy
5,I had a decent USB dongle that was starting to give me connection problems.  Given the importance of Zoom today that suddenly became unacceptable.  I installed this and I'm able to use every bit of speed I'm paying my ISP for.While I'd still rather have wired Ethernet this will keep me going until I have time to get to that.
5,Revise la caja y noté que mandaron la versión con el hardware V2. Con Bluetooth 5.2Fue sencillo instalar y la antena se sujeta bien con el magneto en el chasis se sujeta muy fijo y bien.
5,This review is written on only the first day of ownership so I can't yet speak to long-term reliability. I have also not yet tested the Bluetooth so this review is only in reference to WIFI capabilities. However I am exceptionally pleased with the initial performance of this WIFI card! It was straightforward to install as PCI e and works like a charm once you install the drivers. No connection problems whatsoever. If you are unfamiliar with how to install items onto your computer's motherboard TP-Link provides a video on their website that shows you how to do it.We recently upgraded to a gigabit fiber connection and an ORBI WIFI 6 mesh network (which I also very highly recommend). The TP-Link card is installed in a desktop upstairs and connects to an ORBI satellite more than 30 feet from the base router. The desktop is also about 20 feet from the satellite and maybe about 35 total feet from the base router downstairs. Our average tested speed on the card is 767 down / 658 up. We could not be more pleased with the initial performance. If the reliability is also good this will quickly become money very well spent.My only "complaint" - Many computers no longer have disc drives so you may need to install the driver onto USB from a different computer (if you are adding your WIFI card to your machine for the first time like I was) or make sure it is installed before switching cards. It would be great is products like this shipped with the driver on USB but I suppose that would slightly increase cost. Otherwise this is an excellent card that you should not hesitate to purchase.
5,I've been struggling with Bluetooth forever and I wanted a clean start with Bluetooth 5.  I've not had much luck with dongles they all seem to be off-brand makers with no support.  I wanted something based on other than broadcomm which has been giving me so many problems.  I was happy to find a brand name TPLINK with an even bigger brand name INTEL underneath.Since My Thinkstation P500 does not have a free USB2 Header (required for Bluetooth) I ended up getting a special cable for < $10 that takes and external USB 2 port and converts it to a properly configured USB2 header which I could then connect to the card.  A little clunky for my slight OCD but it instantly worked and the INTEL software instantly recognized it and updated to the latest software and I was off and running.There is still something flakey on my PC (win 10 pro oem) but I don't blame the card for it.  Every once in a while I have to run Windows Troubleshooter for Bluetooth to get it active again.  But this was one of there reasons I wanted to switch the underlaying technology to INTEL instead of BROADCOM at least with INTEL I can easily get support and updated drivers.  With my older USB Dongles I could not get audio to work at all on my modern BLUETOOTH 5.0 headphones.Anyway I also tested WIFI and no complaints but since I have a wired GB connection I turned it off again.  I don't have WIFI6 yet but at least if I ever do I'll be prepared as well.
5,For the longest time ever I had a USB TP-LINK AC1300 (T4U) adapter. It sold for $30 back then and it still sells for $30 now. Aside from the periodic disconnects… it was adequate. Easy to replug to fix just so annoying because it happened all the time!The decision to get this was a variety of factors. One I wanted my front USB port free again. Two I wanted Bluetooth 5.0 on my device (though on my terms) for game controllers and phone connectivity without another USB dongle. Three -  outside the PC the antenna stand can be placed away from the PC and is rather unobtrusive.The big improvements - download speeds went from 170mbps to 400mbps (what my ISP plan is supposed to be). Latency difference was negligible dropped by 1-2ms. Upload speeds weren’t affected probably because they weren’t high to begin with (I have cable). My personal disconnects have gone down as well too. When there is a outage it’s one where the whole house is affected.I had no problems with installing the PCI-E part or the adapter since I had a spare USB header on my motherboard. The cable you need to run from the card to the header is included. I also had no issues with drivers it was plug and play in the latest version of Windows 10. Bluetooth was plug and play too and it showed up once I turned Bluetooth on in the Windows 10 settings.Pretty solid product overall and no complaints other than the price being high from my perspective. Hopefully they provide drivers for the folks having issues.
5,Yeah bud ya just give er and she goes. External extended antenna is cheesy af but if you're a big enough dork you'll find it helpful I guess idk.
4,TP-Link promised a high performance network card with ease of installation. The latter may not be true for some users such as myself.This card was to be installed onto my ASUS WS Z390 PRO motherboard which was running Ethernet/wired previously. After deciding to cut the cord for aesthetics purposes I searched for the best wireless adapter that will be future proof (this). I ran into some issues with the installation that seem to be experienced by only a handful of reviewers.Issue #1 (may be attributed to my motherboard): my workstation board can support 2 channels of PCIe x16. Sounds great right? Except when I use the “appropriate” channel for GPU and this network card my computer would not properly detect the network card. SOLVED by plugging it into the smaller PCIe x4 slot (please note that my MB does not have a dedicated x1 slot but all the slots should work with this card at least in theory)Issue #2: even when I installed this card into the x4 slot my computer still would not detect this card UNTIL I changed PCIe settings to “gen 3” in BIOS. The “auto” setting was not working as intended for me at least. Give this a try before returning if you’re familiar with BIOS.Once these two issues are overcome download drivers from TP-Link website and install the Intel softwares. Enjoy the speed and consistency this little red card provides. So far it seems *very close* to wired connection.Tip: beware of where you install this card. I don’t recommend placing it so close to the GPU as heat may become a bigger problem. Unfortunately for me I have no other choice due to my large GPU and heatsink.
5,easy setup a novice should be able to install without much troubleNo cons at the time of this review
5,The first thing to do after installing this card is go to Intel's website and get the AX200 wifi card driver. Install the driver and it's happy days.When buying this card you're buying an Intel Wi-fi chipset attached to a TP-Link PCIe adapter card. What that means is your driver support will mainly come from the Intel website not the TP-Link one. Once you get that driver issues are much less of an issue. With the Intel drivers the product works really well on Windows 10. The speeds are fast the antennae are easy to screw in and set up and the installation is mostly painless. There's no guff to give on it's performance; Intel makes a really great product.TP-Link's board is a different matter. It installs fine and everything fits but the heatsink is for show. On my unit there is no thermal pad between the big red aluminum heatsink and the Intel Wi-fi chip. I don't know whether there is meant to be a thermal pad or if the Wi-fi chip doesn't get warm enough for it to matter. Either way that heatsink will actually trap any heat the chip is emanating. If you really stress this chipset enough to overheat it and throttle speeds taking off the big red piece of aluminum should help keep it cool.If your computer has an M.2 slot you can also purchase the Intel AX200 card as a desktop kit though it doesn't have the handy magnetic antenna.
4,A fairly painless installation. I did not use the included driver; I just installed the newest version directly from the chipset manufacturer. Works well but my computer didn't have any USB headers left to connect the Bluetooth card as well. Make sure your motherboard has a free header if you want Bluetooth functionality as well.
5,I’ve been using Powerline network adapters for a while because my desktop PC doesn’t have built-in WiFi. With Xfinity I have the 600Mbps plan and over the powerline adapter I was getting about 100-120Mbps on a good day. It was good enough for me as game downloads were decently fast enough (usually 45 minutes or so for a large AAA game). However we recently added a second desktop computer in the back of the house which had WiFi built in to the mobo and it was getting about 350-375Mbps.So I did a little research and this WiFi PCIe card was one of the top rated on several lists. The price was reasonable so I decided to pull the trigger. Boy am I glad! As you can see in the picture I’m now getting almost 550Mbps download and my mind is blown. I’ve been missing out on this speed all this time. Now I can hardly wait until I have another big download to see just how quickly it finishes!Installation was super easy. If you want the Bluetooth functionality (which seems excellent so far in both speed of connecting to my bluetooth earbuds AND range) make sure you have an available F_USB 2.0 header on your motherboard. The magnetic base is quite strong and sticks to the side of my case (since the top is pretty much entirely mesh for air exhaust). I had no issues with installing the drivers which I chose to download from their website rather than using the CD (even though I still have an optical drive).Definitely recommend this!
3,I had bought 2 of these and one is still working fine. It does disconnect once in awhile(once every few months or so) requiring me to disconnect then reconnect from my Wi-Fi in the Windows 10 settings. Speed I get is about 400Mbps from about 20ft away from the router on our Gig speed service. The second one is still working without the antennas attached. Connecting the antenna extenders does give about 400-500 Mbps as well (about 10ft away from the router) but it keeps disconnecting every 10 or so seconds. After unplugging just the antenna part and keeping in the card in it works but only gets about 100 Mbps which is enough but disappointing.
5,I replaced an old (4 or 5 year) WiFi card in my tower. This upgrade improved my speeds about 80% on average. Likely because I am able to use the 5GHz link. However the signal strength shot up through the roof. I'm getting full bars now. The external antenna base is very handy in getting around metal obstacles like the tower case itself. The magnetic base is very strong obviously this is dependent on how much ferrous material is in the surface you are trying to mount to. I just stuck it on top of my steel computer tower - solid. Did not need to fidget with positioning the antenna base. Strong signal which ever way. My WiFi router and computer are in opposite corners of my apartment. The signal goes through my kitchen pantry bath and some furniture - all of which have a lot of metal and a large mirror on a door in the direct path when closed. The direct line between router and my tower is about 40 feet (not that far one would say but - full bars and 80% boost in speed and given how many reflective surfaces are in the way not bad). Almost forgot I have a lot of tools in the way too like a drill press 3D printers tool boxes and an electronic soldering station. This product is quality. Install was very quick and easy. I'm using Windows 10 and actually didn't even need the install any software - just worked. For the price and ease - worth it.
4,My wife and I share this Amazon account. I’ve been in IT since 2001 (A+ Network + MCSA).First installation worked fine until the next day when I rebooted Windows (Win10 x64). Windows couldn’t detect the card and it disappeared in Device Manager. Windows troubleshot re-seated and everything was fine for a few hours until I turned on the PC that evening. Windows did not detect the card again. Reinstalled driver => worked until next few reboots. Re-seated => worked until next few reboots. Reinstalled Windows new driver version from Intel => worked until next few reboots. Lock PCI in msconfig => worked until next few reboots. Move the card to PCIe x16 => worked until next few reboots. I had spent 3 days after that trying thousands possible ways and each time it only worked until next few reboots.In the end I gave up filed a return and exchanged for another. Amazon was very helpful sending me a new one at the moment they created the return label.It’s been 5 days since I installed the replacement and it’s been working without any problem. Had it installed in PCIe x1 slot where it’s supposed to be.My preferred choice in networking products would be TP-LINK and I’ve been their loyal customer for almost a decade. It’s the first time something like this happens. There’s quite a numbers of people having the same problem with this card. I hope they can find the flaw in that returned card because normal QC will not detect it and not put those defected card back on sale.
4,The Archer TX3000E provides a very constant and consistent connection to Wi-Fi 2 in both 2.4 GHz and 5GHz environments. The capabilities it posses are great as it overcomes the obstacles that 5GHz experiences with most connections. It passes through walls and objects very easily making this one of the best long(er) range antennas I have had the pleasure of dealing with. The interface with PCIe makes the WiFi nearly unbeatable to any 3.0 or 3.1 connection. The Bluetooth latency speed and connection is unrivaled as well. A downside to the Bluetooth is that the connecting header cable is in an odd position making it harder to hide cabling for cable management.While the device it's self is everything I need it was very difficult getting the drivers to function and sometimes just rebooting the PC would break the drivers. After installing the Intel Driver Support and using it I was able to get the most current drivers and stable ones. After that indecent I no longer have any complaints.Even with Wi-Fi 2 the speeds are insanely fast and with very occasional yet extremely marginal packet loss that it isn't going to suck. Though not having tested Wi-Fi 3 capabilities I can only expect even more satisfaction.Overall I would recommend this to anyone who needs reliable stable and fast Wi-Fi internet no matter the situation. Be it gaming office connection or a home computer.
5,This definitely helped me out  lot i had a previous dongle that wasnt giving me my full wifi speeds possible and this definitely did. Works great! For those who plan on upgrading ⚠️WARNING! Make sure to install drivers before you switch out yor wifi card especially if you dont have a CD slot
4,Nothing special to mention about installation pretty smooth. It use Intel AX 200 even with latest drivers from Intel (Nov-2021) I can only get upload speed less than 0.5M bps for unknown reason the download speed is normal I can get Wifi connection at 2.4G bps. Search TP-Link community support page someone reported exact same issue but no solution provided.At the same time my HP laptop which using Intel AX 201 has no such issue of weird slow uploading speed problem. Since I almost don't  care upload speed from my desktop I keep this product otherwise I sure I will return it back.
5,This WiFi card makes a great addition to most every desktop computer; Not only does it have fantastic transfer speeds and great range but for Windows 10 machines it can be used effectively as a Hotspot adapter. While I haven't tried to tether point to point using it stand alone with a desktop on wired networking is a treat I didn't think I'd need.The Bluetooth chip is also pretty good even for using audio devices like a Bose Soundlink III (little older but a good test point). For those already running wired networking the Windows Update drivers (in Windows 10) are basically immediately installed (and work correctly) so another huge plus in my book.It might not be the cheapest card it might not be in your color scheme for the PC build but don't overlook this component; It's great in already existing environments and just as well for building one from scratch if you want to (say have a wired router and then using several of these in a PC to build the wireless access point).If the next gen model from TP-Link is half as good as this one is I'm on board for it to enhance my network. Let's go.
5,Pros:- Significantly faster Wifi. I went from their TL-WN725N USB dongle model to this PCIe card and jumped from an average of 30Mbps downloads speeds to 85ish Mbps.- Bluetooth signal now reaches to all parts of my apartment. My bluetooth headphones no longer cut out as I walk room to room.- Install was super easy and fast.Cons:- Much bulkier than a dongle.- Requires a USB 2.0 slot on your motherboard.- I don't have a CD drive to download the drivers took my computer a second to find and fetch all the drivers needed for Wifi and bluetooth to work properly.EDIT: After using this for a little over a week I seem to be running into issues with the card being picked up on my PCI-e slot. I'm unsure if this was caused by the card suddenly going faulty or if there was some driver update.As I take a look at my BIOs the slot shows empty my internet adapters do no pick up the card strangely enough though the Bluetooth still works. I'm only able to resolve this issue by opening up my computer unplugging and plugging back in the card each time I start up the computer which is very annoying.I've ordered a replacement card to see if that resolves the issues. If not I will be returning in search of another product.EDIT 2:I received the replacement card installed it and tested. Everything seemed to check out interestingly my original card also works now.Considering the original did work for a bit and started cutting in and out I'm curious if it had something to do with the drivers and potentially installing in the new card flushed them out?If anyone else runs into similar issues then please let me know I'd love to know what was causing this weird bug.Anyway back to 5 stars!
5,Almost plug and play simple. Looks good and quality feels good as well. Antenna cord is nice and long and the magnetic base is very strong. You can mount this upside without any worry. Although I lost a lot of speed (600Mb/s) I'm still able to play all of my games without lagging. Overall a very good product for anyone needing WIFI capability in their PC.
5,This is the first time I have written an amazon review in the 10+ years during which I've bought hundreds of products from here. Most of them served the purpose they were supposed to serve some better than others.Now let me tell you why I'm writing a review for this beast. I have a desktop PC and I have not been able to have an ethernet connection since about a year now so I've been forced to buy cheap USB wifi adapters (10-20$ ones) which usually work for a week or so and then they are the most frustrating things to deal with on this earth. Constant ping problems constant disconnections it was completely unbearable. I went through four (4) USB wifi adapters and they were all pieces of garbage in the end. I was just so fed up with these problems that I just decided to buy one of these internal wifi cards!And let me tell you it was the best purchase of my life. I get WiFi from a 1 gig router at the other side of the house so it's a ways away from my adapters. However this beast of a card ALWAYS has full bars and never drops connections. I can finally game stream and talk to friends without the fear that I will be disconnected from a match or a call. This is true bliss.PLEASE if you have a desktop PC and you need to get on WiFi DO NOT get a USB adapter. Get this one. You will NOT regret it.
5,Great product so far!  I own an Xfinity account with 300 Mbps (download) and 10Mbps (upload) speeds.With my OEM wifi nic card I was getting 70mbps/5mbps.  Now I'm getting on average 350mbps/11mbps!!WHOOP WHOOP!!
5,My motherboard did not have WiFi built in so I have relied on a wired connection. If course wired is better but not having the option for WiFi sucked in the event I was traveling and wanted to take my PC with me.So I bought this. It was super easy to install. Just remove the expansion slot cover that corresponds to the PCIE slot you're using click into place screw it down and attach the cables. Once I booted on I expected to have to download the drivers manually either via the provided disc or online but it found and automatically downloaded the drivers for me. It was instantly usable upon booting thr system.The bluetooth capabilities is a nice touch too. Very useful for pairing my speakers or a headset to use for gaming while not having to worry about excess wires or stuff getting in the way.One note however is that it does require an open USB2 header on your motherboard. This is how it receives power. Make sure you have an empty one. In my case I just unplugged my wraith prism cooler because all the USB header does for it is make its RGB programmable via software but thankfully its color settings are saved upon startup so I can keep it unplugged forever now. It also has a built on heat spreader so that's good.Overall this is a great expansion card to have if you want bluetooth and wifi capabilities on your desktop PC.
5,It was really good I was getting higher speeds with WiFi 6
5,This wifi card looks really nice and it performs absolutely perfect. I used to have a wifi card that wouldn't get the best speeds but this one is consistent at the max speed my internet allows.
5,Great product simple to setup.  Instructions are good but might be a little too simplistic for some when it comes to plugging the Bluetooth into the motherboard.  Drivers were super easy to install and it even came with an extra riser support to adjust it from a full size down to fit my small form factor Dell 3050.
5,There are about 1000 wifi+bluetooth cards on Amazon and I chose this one for its unique external antenna feature. I found the device exceptionally well made.  The electronics are contained inside a machined metal case attached onto the board and all connectors and cables seem high quality.  The instructions were quite simple.  Plug the card into a spare PCIE X1 slot and connect the bus cable to a spare USB multipin connector on your motherboard.  When I ordered I rolled the dice that my spare slots were infact PCIE X1 and I lucked out - it fit!  My high-spec Dell Xeon workstation has lots of USB connectors including an installed card reader which took up that spare USB connector on the motherboard.  So in the end I disconnected the card reader (I can live without it - I'll just get an external one and plug it into one of my 8 USB jacks) and plugged in the card bus cable.  Next I installed the two drivers (a restart necessary in-between) and voila all works perfectly.  The software appears to be an Intel routine which is reassuring but who knows... The external antenna is a plus but the cord is not long enough to get up to desk level for me but still sitting on top of the PC case it's delivering a strong signal.  So all in all two thumbs up for this device.
5,Previously I had been plagued by drops and lag during Starcraft Dota 2 and CS:GO matches and switching over to WiFi 6 was a god send.  It's not as good as a ethernet direct connection but it's close enough I can game without major frustration and no wire that can trip anyone going down the stairs.  I've had no issues with drivers for this device.  The magnetic base for the antenna I stuck to the top of my PC tower and I like the design of it.  I was a little hesitant about getting this card I haven't used anything from the TP brand before but it's been hassle free so far.  I will likely try another TP branded device in the future I'm quite pleased with it.  The price is very reasonable as well.My only complaint about it might be that my Alienware laptop WiFi and iPad WiFi card seem to have a better connection from a very similar position in my room downstairs and neither of them use a major antenna.  So I lowered my WiFi signal rating a bit lower.  For my use case this device does the job and I would recommend it for the price.
5,Once installed and selected my internet speed doubled.  To get those GB speeds you need Wi Fi 6 because Wi Fi 5 just isn't going to be fast enough.  This has made a huge difference in my streaming on my desktop.
5,My wifi speed was 100mbps with my PC’s built in antenna. I ran the test right before installing this. After I installed it I was getting 650 mbps. I was absolutely blown away. Time will tell how well it holds up but so far I’m mad at myself for not doing this years ago.
5,Switched to this from a USB wifi device. Increased my download rate by nearly 200 Mbps (from 288 to around 480 Mbps. Also lowered my ping by several ms to just 12 ms. I am actually exceeding the 400 Mbps plan that I have with Spectrum. I also upgraded my router to the Nighthawk XR1000 which I am sure also had a lot to do with my results.
5,WiFi signal was good
1,My story was a bit long and sad: I was using a USB wireless adapter for an old PC in the basement the wireless signal was on and off so I thought I wanted to give this PCIE based wifi 6 card a try.Got it quickly from Amazon plug it into an PCIE 1x it was not recognized. Then I realized that there is a cable that you need to connect to an internal USB socket on motherboard Never thought there is that kind of design: you have to plugin into PCIE and USB at the same time for a device? what a dumb design! TPLink or Intel you guys suck in designing this gadget...The nightmare did not stop here in fact it started: I have a fancy computer case that already use all the internal USB plus the Video card I have is very big so I had to dissemble quite some components and connections in order to plugin that internal USB. Once I finished that and put everything back in. Power on... guess what? My CPU voltage shows as 0.2v and will not boot...After a whole night of troubleshooting and testing (CPU memory video card) all eliminated from defective list and turned out my motherboard turned bad... Here I don't fully blame the TpLink/Intel card as it could be my dumb hands... Anyways since the machine was a few years old I could get a motherboard replacement for less than this wireless card costs.The new motherboard is a mATX as compared to my previous board was an ATX I lost some ports/connections but who cares I just want my data back. I got the new board and quick dissembled the old board and component and put the new motherboard in. Luckily I light up the monitor the first try. All good Windows got reactivated all device still working.Now I could return the TpLink card after its poor design and indirectly caused my motherboard's death... But I figured why not try it again on the new motherboard (you can tell I'm the kind of person stubborn and won't give in easily).Well after trying all the PCIE slots (1x and 16x) I finally gave up: The Bluetooth works but not WiFi: in on PCIE slot the wifi device  (intel wifi 6 ax200 160Mhz) cannot be recognized at all (Bluetooth device worked) in another PCIE slot the wife device was recognized but got a device cannot start (code 10) error.I tried to update to latest Intel driver did not help.I tried some registry fix found on YouTube and other website did not help either.Turned out there are quite some people out there having same issue (code 10) as I did with this card (Intel AX200 chipset). I think TPLink is not the one to blame here just to be fair.At this point I already spent a couple of nights test and research on the issue. 40 bucks for the used motherboard replacement.Some related technical background: I started assembling PCs about 25 yr ago when I was a middle schooler. I studied computer science and making a living on it (software not hardware). I have the troubleshooting skills better than an average person. But this thing was such a pain that I would not recommend anyone to get it.It could work for you maybe 80-90% OOTB but I think for a good PC device that number should be at least 99%.Hope this review helps. This card is going back to Amazon/Wholefoods soon.
5,works well
4,Honestly this card is awesome I went from having 2 bars to now having full bars and my speeds have drastically improved. It solved all the issues I had from my previous card i.e. speed and signal strength. In my room previously getting around 300 Mbps now with this card I am getting at least 500+ Mbps and at times as high as 700 Mbps my router is placed downstairs and my room is upstairs. Keep in mind that I did get a WiFi 6 router around the time when I got this card so that also added to the speed increase. Please note that I have a gigabit internet connection so depending on what connection you have with your service provider your performance may vary.My only complaint with this card is that it doesn't perform that great with uploads I was getting around 100 Mbps. When hard wired my uploads are around 700+ Mbps so I know my upload speeds are around that. But this doesn't bother me since I don't upload that much. Even when I have to upload 100 Mbps is still a lot. So if you upload a lot such as a Youtuber I would look for other solutions. Other than that this card is great.
5,I have a Linux-based NAS (server) that I wanted to move into a utility room with no wired network outlet so I was looking for a Wifi adapter that was fast enough to run backups from my PC over it and one that would reliably stay connected since I manage the NAS over the WiFi (if the connection went down then logging into it directly would mean carrying a keyboard and monitor into there). I tried two other 802.1ac adapters both with Realtek chips - one was very fast but the connection kept dropping out plus it took a lot of manual setup in Linux the other was easy to set up and stayed connected but was relatively slow at 400Mpbs. This TP-Link one is better at both.I'm running Fedora 33 on the NAS and this was super-easy to install - just plug the card in and configure the Wifi. I installed it 6 weeks ago now and it has been up and connected with no issues since then. My WiFi access point is not ax (yet) so it's using 802.1ac and connects at 780mbps (see the screenshot - it is the one that says Intel).
5,I went from using a TP Link USB dongle to this card. I had to move my computer and the dongle was no longer cutting it my connection was constantly dropping and was generally atrocious when it did connect. I am very very happy. Installation was a breeze and I was delighted to find that my motherboard had an empty USB connection for the Bluetooth. The antenna also assembled easily and sits securely on top of my PC case. The difference was IMMEDIATE. I couldn't stream video before from where this PC is sitting and now everything loads quickly and easily. I don't do a ton of gaming so I can't speak to performance in that arena. But I was deciding between this and 2 cheaper cards with slightly lower specs and this was worth every penny for me. The Bluetooth wasn't the most important decision in my purchase but it works so well I'm excited that I have the option available. I paired my phone and sent a PDF as a test and it worked really well. As someone who only occasionally dips their toe into modifying PCs I am very happy with the performance of the card.
5,When paired with TP Link wifi6 router I get a strong powerful fast signal. Luvit.
5,Pros:* Bluetooth coverage is MASSIVELY upgraded from an old ASUS Bluetooth 4.2 USB dongle I connected to the front of my computer. When I leave the office my wireless ear buds stay in range.* Wifi reception is EXCELLENT. I have a Wifi 6 capable router at home and latency is almost non-existent. (But for this comparison my desktop is in/adjacent to the room with the router)* Did not need driver CD with Windows 10. (Was also connected via ethernet at the time so MS might have automatically found an up to date driver)Cons:* I forgot to hook up the USB 2.0 dongle the first time so I had to take apart my computer again* The only available PCI slot for this card is right beneath my graphics card. This is due to my bottom most PCI slot  being disabled for my NVME storage and yada yada.Other thoughts:Given the speed and coverage of this bluetooth antenna I'm strongly considering getting more bluetooth capable accessories for my computer to play music through.
4,Well let me start off by saying that pre opened products were the only thing available. The instructions left something to be desired. If you have never opened your computer up and changed items up. Stop right here and start searching YouTube for how to videos. Because the paperwork provided is not sufficient. Everything needed was included and signal works as advertised. My only other beef aside for ease of installation was loading drivers. I had to buy a external disc drive to use the provided driver disc because obviously I didn’t have an internet connection without wi-fi… duh. Something to consider if you are building verses a prebuilt that you’re just upgrading.
5,Works great the Bluetooth is a great feature Wi-Fi range is plenty or normal houses.
5,So I did a ton of research. I was going back and forth on which AX card to buy and I settled on this one. Been running the card for 2 weeks now and haven't had a single issue. Not to mention the speed is amazing!!!Computer sits about 100 feet away from my router and it's also on the 2nd floor of my home while the router is on the main level. I am able to pull full signal with no problem running at the AX (Wifi6) speed. I game while running video streams and have had zero issues with speed or latency.Windows recognized the card upon boot up and I've had zero issues with the wireless cutting out and no issues with the bluetooth.While nothing is ever gonna beat the speed and latency of hard wiring I am beyond pleased with what this card can do. It's easily the best wireless network card I've owned.*Side Note* as stated in numerous reviews this card does need a USB pin out on the motherboard to connect to for the bluetooth function to work.
5,Having the ability to place the antennas elsewhere with the extra wired station helped with signal immensely.
5,I noramlly never used wifi for my home pc but where I live now I have to have the router in a different room in the house. So I just got a USB 3.0 adapter since supposedly it could hit high speeds. When downloading games of Steam I would get 10-25mb/s but it was never consistent. Sometimes the signal strenth would waver and slow down etc. So I finally decided to pull the trigger on one of these types of adapters and wowzer! I was getting a solid 40mb/s constantly off steam. Never had speeds that high off steam. My wifi signal is a consistently strong and the blutooh is stronger and I can go around the house farther with my wireless headphones than I used too.God bless Christ is coming soon do take any chips or brain implants. Stay safe! Masks are being used as training to get used to obeying the government doing what they say and trusting in their experts. We are not in their best interest. They are doing whats best for them and their corporate overlords. Always question everything the government says never trust them on face value always hold politicians under suspicion.
5,I really liked it. I'm not a tech genius. I'm not smart- I bought this gaming computer off a girl who was selling her custom built gaming computer she created for streaming. She had an el-gato built into it but i had no real use for that so I unplugged it to make room for this Wi-Fi card. It's sorta larger than I expected but also I didn't really research that. Crazy easy to hook up I feel like my mom could've installed this with directions. The instructions are pretty straightforward. It does come with a CD that you run an Auto.exe file to install the drivers me personally though I had to download my drivers off the website which is also very easy. Just download open the file Click setup and run it.Also I really like the antenna that you play ontop. Pretty strong magnet to keep it in place I like it a lot. Not that ugly either. Aesthetics are a big thing for me and I don't really hate it.Also Super good wi-fi ZERO hiccups. Smooth sailing no issues. I downloaded like 10 games all at once no issues. Bluetooth works everything works really easy love it.
5,I'm not a WiFi guy I prefer plugging straight into the router and always have. However this card feels very much like ethernet level performance. I had moved my old computer into the bedroom for streaming movies music tv and games from my new pc in the office which has a 22tb library of just about all content. Anywho I had been using a TL-WN881ND V1.1 and it did the job fine except for when many people were awake in the house and using the WiFi scrubbing through movies or streaming games there was quite a bit of lag and or pixelation (which slowly snowballed into more pixelation due to a lack of heatsink). So without much research but just blind hope I ordered this card hoping it'll fix these issues and... woola it did. Not only that but jeez this card is fast I had gotten 750mbps (DL) on speed test where my old card was getting around 200 something. So I'm thankful I won't have to run a 100 foot ethernet cable from the bedroom to the office because of the killer performance of this card I no longer fear WiFi.
5,Make sure you update both your motherboard drivers and any other essential drivers in your system! Your results will be different based on your computer specs. You'll also want to have a WiFi 6 router that can handle the higher bandwidths and for better signal performance. You shouldn't have any issues if you've checked all steps like these that can lead to issues.
5,I was using an AC600 usb wifi adapter I purchased on Amazon prior. This was doing fine while I was in a small apartment however I just recently moved into a new home where my office was farther away from my router. There are several walls and a room in between the router and my desktop. I upgraded my router to a Netgear Nighthawk X6 router hoping it would increase my signal strength. I was still getting around the same result. The router worked extremely well for all my other devices and the 5ghz band was reaching my max download speed from my internet provider when near the router. I finally decided to upgrade to this TP-Link AX3000 wifi adapter to attach to my PCIe slot and WOW! I am now achieving the max download speed on my 5ghz band going from ~3mbps to ~300mbps! My phone gets around 150mbps when connected to the same wifi in the same room. My desktop's wifi speed is just as fast as a wired connection now (tested from router straight to laptop). Installation took about 5 mins and I just downloaded the drivers straight from TP-Link's site. I highly recommend this product and have absolutely no complaints. I may try upgrading my internet plan now that I'm consistently hitting my max download and upload speed!
5,I haven't used the bluetooth function yet but the wifi function is perfect.I run linux i have Linux Mint 19.3 with kernel 5.3. I have read that you need at least kernel 5.1 in order to run this so I installed the newer kernel.I have experienced no issues so far though I have only used it for about a week now.The reception on this is actually really good. I mean I installed the card but didn't plug in the antennas and still was able to pick up a pretty decent signal strength from the router (about 75%). I don't know if that's just because the router is really strong or if it's because the card has just a good design but in either case I was able to use this without a problem to catch the wifi from the 2nd floor while the router is on the 1st floor.A bunch of people say they experience faster wifi with this but personally I don't see a difference. The wifi is just as fast as when i used a USB wifi card.  I think the others are experiencing a new device justification bias (I can't think of the name of that effect at this time). Anyway it works and I am happy with it.
5,Need an empty usb hub off motherboard to power device. Buy a motherboard usb hub if you don’t have any available. Most important info. I have a splitter already so took a minute to install and seconds to connect. Also remember to disable the old wifi connecter so It only uses the new adapter (no drivers needed if you an Intel board you prob have driver fo current wifi adapter (don’t disable Bluetooth)I have to say this thing is amazingly fast. Super nice components. You can def tell the build quality is superior and the connection is a lot faster. It opened up a baseline of way more speed since I am using an ASUS ROG ATX-11000 WiFi 6 router. Pairs with this amazingly and get wicked speeds even 30ft away. It’s not far but it’s a computer. The router really helps a lot but the connections speeds are much faster with wifi 6 connection and the mu-mimo to help navigate through the 20 devices all connecting at once.
3,I wanted to replace the AC3168 onboard wifi I had on my desktop this was newer tech and even though my router is only AC I thought I'd notice some improvements with the 2x2 antenna vs the 1x1 I had built in (along with just newer tech and drivers). I have a few walls between my router and PC and the 5ghz didn't have reliable enough signal strength to be the primary connection.Disabled my onboard wifi and installed it in a PCI 3.0x16 slot that was well positioned to route the USB power cable Windows recognized the card but the device wouldn't start. Tried the TP-Link drivers Intel drivers removing devices and reinstalling multiple reboots- no luck. Moved the wifi card to a PCI 3.0x1 slot that made it more difficult to plug in the USB but that solved the issue. I am guessing this isn't exactly a TP-Link issue and something to do with Windows or the motherboard it was a hassle but I don't really blame the card.Tested the wifi and the bluetooth both worked and the signal strength was WAY better than I saw with my tiny onboard antennas off the back of my case. That said... Pinging my router and Google (several hundred times) as well as testing various internet speed test sites multiple times I saw an average increase in latency around 5-10ms and a decrease in speeds of around 15-20mbps. I only get 100mbps internet so that is a decent drop. Occasional peaks of 70-80ms just pinging my router seemed odd bringing the average to 4ms onboard hitting a max of 15ms with an average of 1ms.So it works its just worse than my older tech onboard card. I will keep it and maybe try it out again if I get an AX router but for now I removed it and am using the TP-Link antenna with my onboard solution- getting the better signal strength (full 5ghz whooo) lower latency and faster speeds.
5,WOW! What a difference. My connection speed is 400 mbps and this thing gave me speed more than sitting opposite end of the router in my home.I moved to a new house and as per the brilliant design by the builder there is no hardwire connection from model to the study so for my desktop I was using two options Netgear N300 Wifi USB stick and another Netgear wifi extender that plugs into the wall. Both of them sucked a$$ and the max speed I ever got in the past 6 months was 50mbs. I was losing my mind to the point that I had given up and was going to order 100 feet wire to connect my router to model. But then after reading glowing reviews I decided to give this puppy a try one last time and WOW! Oh my goodness. This is a solid product and I was forced to write a review after seeing the speed. I downloaded drivers from TP link website and installed and after that we see the magical speed as in the photo attached. Go get this product. It is solid.
5,Installing drivers for wifi was easy and the speed you get is in another league compared to previous protocol (using it with "ASUS ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 AX11000 Tri-Band 10 Gigabit WiFi Router" link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MRD1LDZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).The first time you open the browser you can tell the difference and from then on you feel everything else slow. Gaming or streaming in multiples devices makes no impact in the speed you get.Installing bluetooth (BT) was somewhat of a hassle for it uses a 9-pin port in the motherboard. I tried using it with "NZXT Internal USB Hub" (link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IFGFTJ2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) but could not make it work. I had to let loose front panel USB. Even for a tech newbie won't be difficult.Making the BT drivers work was a little harder mainly because the motherboard had a BT 4.0 adapter. BT from the new card only worked after unistalling old adapter in Windows Device Management. Even with all the time it took its all worth it BT 5.0 range and speed is amazing.By the way the red heat sink looks really cool.Anyone with a Wi-fi 6 router ought to get a paired adapter and this Wifi card its a great option.
3,I purchased this to make a wired desktop wireless.  For that it works great.  The way it arrived was a bit of an issue.  Since this item is supposed to be new I expected it to be packaged in a normal manufacturers box.  It arrived in no manufacturers packaging at all.  It and all accessories arrived tightly wrapped and taped in a clear plastic bag.  As well the shipping container wasn’t a box.  It was an Amazon envelope so this electronic device had no protection during shipping.  As a result the software/driver installation disk was busted.  I actually had little hope the device work but I couldn’t see any physical damage to the module itself so I installed it and downloaded the software and drivers from the manufacturers website.  As I said it works great but the way it arrived leaves wondering what the heck I actually received.
5,The WiFi card was super easy to install into my PC build I just plugged it in and attached the two attenas on the outside of the card as well as the bluetooth wire right into my motherboard. It automatically recognized in my computer and I was able to connect to my WiFi without needing to install anything although it does come with a CD for install.I haven't tested the bluetooth yet but I am happy with this card and I do not lag in my FPS games! Before I was using a USB wifi stick and my WiFi wasn't as fast as the direct install of the WiFi card.The only downside is that this WiFi card is red. So if you care about your PC build aesthetic from looking on the outside in then I would find a different WiFi card. I kind of wish it came in black but because the WiFi slot falls under the GPU it really doesn't matter much especially since the performance of this card is 10/10.
5,After removing the PCI slot cover from my PC I installed the TP-Link WiFi card into the motherboard on my Dell XPS tower.  However I did NOT have a female USB connector available on the Motherboard which was supposed to be necessary since the card has a small cable that's supposed to plug into the motherboard.  There's a Note in the Quick Installation Guide that states "If the Bluetooth USB cable is not correctly connected to the motherboard Bluetooth function won't work even after driver installation."After installing the drivers the Bluetooth works on my computer.  You might check your motherboard to determine if it has an available female USB connector before purchasing this product.  Honestly I'm surprised that everything worked out.  I didn't need this product for Wifi but instead purchased this product since the Bluetooth died on the motherboard on my PC.
5,Something I forgot about when building a PC was WiFi. Been using laptops and tablets for a while and forgot about WiFi as a feature. My router is on the opposite side of the house and i get poor reception to my phone and tablet. Added this and was hoping for a semi decent connection.Definitely surpassed my expectations. Still nothing compared to a wired connection if you have the option for that but highly recommend if WiFi is an only option.Paired with a B450f mobo.Installation was very simple. Obviously needed to be wired to internet for DLing drivers from the website but a CD was included for those with a cd drive installed.No issues with drivers on windows 10. Have used it for gaming and have no complaints when comparing To other WiFi connections.I have not tested the Bluetooth range or compatibility.I love the option to use the magnetic base and antennas. Feels very solid and doesn’t look bad.Those who are super into color ways and lighting just remember it is bright red lol. Luckily it fit into my red and black theme.
5,Short Review: This device is excellent. The performance is just solid and the range is impressive. Has better range and performance then previous AC cards read below for details.Disclaimer: I own a regular AC1900 router not AX and still saw massive improvements.The paragraph below explains my previously owned device so you may gauge if this product is right for you.I previously owned an MSI branded Intel AC3168 wireless card. My computer is at the opposite corner and end of a decently sized home. The AC3168 continuously struggled to keep a stable connection of a 5Ghz Band. The AC3168 also gave me about 25-35% of the total possible bandwidth my internet provider advertised.As for this beast of a Network card rocking the AX200 chip even without the antenna accessory attached gave me the full speed of my internet connection and the stability is perfect. It dropped the ping about 10-15ms which is perfect. I know this chip is capable of speeds between 800-950 Mbps for this with gigabit internet connections.In the photo: excuse my bad wiring the antenna has one wire coming to it and it splits into two when connecting to the card. Unfortunately the Bluetooth feature does need a USB header to be taken.
3,I don't know if I received a faulty one but I had trouble keeping the wifi card connected to my PC. When it was recognized by the PC the connection was amazing. However I frequently ran into problems where my computer would longer see the wifi card connected to the PC and thus losing internet.To get the card working I had to push the card back in or take it out and push it back in so it seems to me that it was very touchy with the PCI-e connection. I've had to do this routine about once every 2 to 3 days...I got this card refurbished so that could be related too.
4,Works well. Very fast. Had to move my desktop into a place where LAN cables couldn't reach and I barely miss my LAN connection. I have little basis for comparison as I've never put a wifi card in this computer until this one.I did have trouble setting this up. I don't blame TP Link because this was not a typical use case and the issue was with a Windows 10 setting not the card itself. Once working everything was fine. I needed to put this in a PCIe 4x slot since my 1x slot is blocked by the graphics card. W10 did not like that very much. Drivers installed fine but got a Code 10 (device failure; driver related). I found a setting in Power Options> PCI Express called "Linked Power Management" and turned this off - more or less it's an attempt from W10 to moderate the voltage supplied to the PCI Express ports. Once I turned it off the Code 10 error disappeared and I was good to go.
5,Works as intended no complaints
5,I just changed ISP to get fiber.  Unfortunately the drop from the street was on the opposite side of my house.  It would have cost extra to go through the attic and get it closest to my computer systems.  I decided to go with the shortest fiber run which was directly to my 4K TV which has its benefits but meant WiFi to my computer systems.  My computer has 802.11n but the radio frequency was only 2.4GHz no 5GHz.  I only got ~54Mbit/s maximum.  This adapter was a best seller on Amazon and there is a very good reason for that.  It is super easy to install the hardware and software.  You plug-in the card load the software disable your adapter and enable this adapter.  What could be simpler?  My speed tests instantly jumped to over 300Mbit/s (my service max) over WiFi.  I am completely satisfied and would recommend this adapter to anyone wanting maximum 802.11n 5G speeds!  Very very happy!
5,This is a great product but it does come with a disclaimer. *If you do not know how or feel comfortable installing a PCIe card into your computer then DO NOT buy this product.*So if like me you built a computer years ago it didn't have a built in WiFi adapter but it didn't matter because you just plugged a CAT-5 into your computer. However a few moves later I am unable to connect to the router directly I had a junky little USB wifi adapter but it is old unreliable and slow.Got this card plugged it in and then a few seconds later it was up and running bluetooth and all. Just takes an empty USB panel header to power it. I get consistant and stable speeds that are solid enough to stream and play online multiplayer games with no problem. If you fit the use case for this product you will be pleased with this product.
5,I upgraded from an ASUS PCE-N15 that I got on a trade with a roommate over 10 years ago as I remember. Now I get the download speeds advertised on my plan.Internet Plan:Cox. 150Mbps Down 10 Mbps UpRouter:Whatever Cox is overcharging to rent to me. Panoramic blah blah blahResults over 5 speed test runs before and after:I went from 30.64 to 176.9 Mbps DownUpload stayed about the same right about 10Mbps (limited by Cox Plan)Ping stayed about the same at 12-13 msI am using Windows 10 and downloaded the ax200 drivers from Intel prior to installing the card. Then it was plug and play. Well worth it to replace an old dumpy card and have room to grow with Wi-Fi 6.Bluetooth:Sorry I haven't tested the Bluetooth; it's not a feature that I purchased this for.
5,I bought this because I recently moved my desk to the garage (35 feet and 2 walls) and created some (expected) connectivity issues. I have a 175 MB/s connection and started seeing 85 MB and a 50% higher ping (from 10ms to 20ms). My plan to mitigate this was to go to Wifi 6 rather than mesh because I wanted the lowest ping possible. So I needed to upgrade my WiFi card and my router but I didn't have $500 handy so I just started with this WiFi card. After a 2 hour long installation process that was entirely due to me not slotting the card all the way in (oops) I got it to work in easily. I ran the speed test on my 5ghz WiFi 5 router and it was pinned at 178 MB/s with a 13 Ms ping! I repeated this multiple times and also verified that my phone still maxes out at 85 MB/s in the same location. I'm guessing that the giant external antennas are the reason. TLDR: works better than advertised!
3,Got this card to replace a TP-Link USB adapter which capped out at 25megabit for whatever reason although never disconnected.  This one is much faster but suffers from frequent disconnects (maybe 10 times a day).  Driver version does not seem to matter nor did lowering the 802.11 version.  Win/Linux behavior identical.  Seems to be a common problem based on web searches for this chipset.
3,Be aware that these *require* Windows 10.  While I know Windows 7 is well out of service.  I own machines that won't install Windows 10 that could still be useful if they were on the network.  This was no help for those machines.
5,I originally purchased this adapter to replace the existing one in my computer. At the time I was using an Asus RT-AC86U router. This adapter is working well at WiFi 5 (802.11ac) speed but there was a catch. I did not use the driver CD  included with the adapter as usually the driver is outdated. I downloaded the latest driver from Intel. It seem to work for a little bit and then I'd get random disconnects. After troubleshooting I found that the newer driver seems to have problems causing disconnect issues. I decided to use the old driver from the driver CD and this worked perfectly. Later I decided to upgrade my router to an Asus RT-AX58U to take advantage of the full capabilities of this WiFi card. I decided to try the newest driver first. I've had zero disconnects using the latest driver using an actual WiFi 6 router the Asus RT-AX58U (802.11ax). So be warned that if you intend to use this adapter on a WiFi 5 (802.11ac) router the latest driver at this time could cause random disconnect issues.
4,I had done a lot of research before purchasing this WiFi part for my sons new gaming computer we built him. He using the blue tooth now for his head phone and WiFi signal and speed is great from across our farmhouse to his room. I don’t think he would notice a speed difference if we hard wired him in over Ethernet cable. No dropping issues noticed at all. It does what it should and works great overall months later.BUT all that praise from use after installation. I had some issues with installing it and getting operational. It took hours of trouble shooting to get it working correctly. This is on a new Windows 10 Pro custom built PC. Probably the most time consuming WiFi card install I have done but happy with the new results.
5,This was a temporary solution while I worked out getting a cable connection but I came away very impressed. Installed it booted my system and Windows automatically detected the device and installed drivers. Was up and running in just a few minutes. Performance is good not ethernet/hardwire good admittedly but acceptable considering where my system was located and the quality of my router (which is very good but not the best) and my lack of desire to mess with the router settings to improve performance (my guess is you could easily get close to ethernet performance if you know what you are doing or do a little research). Bluetooth works great and I really like the magnetic antenna holder as I can secure it to my pc case. However the base has some weight to it so you could easily put it on a desk or nonmetallic surface and not have to worry about it moving around.
4,The range on this thing is awesome.  From my house to past the middle of my back yard. One problem I had was that i didn't have a free USB slot on my motherboard and had to get a splitter to share an existing used slot.  Tech support was considerate but unhelpful.  I purchased this because my desktop was so old it didn't have Bluetooth.  Not too difficult to install but it would help to have some experience with computer internals.
5,Finally a wi-fi signal to and from a remote bedroom with no lag and no drops.  This card is seriously one of the best wi-fi devices I have ever had.  It would be worth disabling old wi-fi/bluetooth hardware in a machine and just adding this card on.  The wi-fi gain is massive. I was pretty sure I was going to have to put an access point in the upstairs of my house but this thing is astounding.  No connection issues doesn't get whacked by a cell phone close by and provides blue tooth 5!  I have the antenna unit on top of the pc case (Lian Li aluminum mid tower) and it is above the wireless router by about 15 feet in elevation but the  signal has to go through 2 walls to get to and from the router and it's 5 bars all the way all the time.Wi-fi 6 is freaking awesome!!!  Thanks TP-Link!!!
5,Very happy with the result so far. I was previously using an adapter that I believe was discontinued since I can't find it anywhere anymore and it would stop working or just barely work every once in a while. I bought this adapter and one other to test and this was the one that won. It's ping and download were about 10% higher and the upload was about 20% higher. I did 20 internet speed tests over a period of 20 minutes (for each adapter) and here are the averages:This Adapterping = 13.55download = 97.9upload = 22.95The Competitor's Adapterping = 12.4download = 88.15upload = 18.95and for reference my previous adapter would generally get aboutping = 11download = 77upload = 16
5,Fast stable overall great.Minor latency spikes when trying to go over 200 Mbps but I am also very far from my access point.
5,I very highly recommend this setup. Installing the PCIe card was a breeze and yes in order to use the Bluetooth you must sacrifice a USB header on your motherboard. This is more than made up for in the range and signal strength. I feel like I've finally found the Bluetooth solution I've been looking for and wasting time and money buying little USB dongles.DO get on the Intel support site and search for "Intel® Wi-Fi 6 AX200 (Gig+)" and you will need both the Bluetooth and WiFi driver installers. Updating is absolutely essential.I am very very happy with the sound on my Sony WH1000mx3 and this wifi signal is at 100% through a wall and across the apartment.  I marked tech support as a 3 because I haven't had to deal with them so far.
5,Out of every WiFi client I have this card performs the best out of them all.  I got two of these in preparation for a WiFi 6 router.I have Gigabit service through Comcast (1 Gbps/42 Mbps).  With the card on 802.11 AC I can get speeds up to 400-700 Mbps. Connected to an 802.11 AX router I've so far gotten up to just under 900 Mbps.  Latency also tens to be about 4 or 5 ms less.  On 802.11 AC alone I'm seeing a boost around 200-300 Mbps compared to the USB dongles with high gain antennas I've been using.I have also seen better connection stability to both 802.11 AC and AX routers.I would recommend this card even if you don't have an AX router.My only complaint is Amazon would only let me buy two and I have a family of 4.  I'm having to go elsewhere at a higher price for the others.
5,This review is about TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000 PCIe WiFi Card (Archer TX3000E)I used it to get better BT signal in my flat. Before this device I used a usb adapter to get  bluetooth from the desktop PC.  There were quite a few places inside the apartment where BT connectivity was rather lacking. After installing TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000 which went smoothly all these places are perfectly covered with BT5 connection. I'm satisfied. As a bonus I got an opportunity to connect my PC to the router with wi fi. I checked it  it works without a hitch and greater speeds compared to other wifi devices of mine.
5,Overall:With this card I use multiple Bluetooth devices at the same time without any issues!This includes BLE mice keyboards earbuds Bose headset and more.Major / important feature for me:This card works with built-in Windows 10 'Bluetooth & other devices'! Some of my Bluetooth devices won't work with USB Bluetooth dongles because those dongles often use their own BLE software/driver stack. This card works beautifully with everything I've tried!The Rest:Hardware installation was a breeze. Follow the simple printed-out instructions that are included.Software installation was also a breeze. Use the included CD to install the Intel drivers. I've read that you can also go to Intel's website to download them but the drivers on the CD work great.The antenna magnetic base is very nice and sturdy.The antenna cable is a bit short (about 2 feet). But its long enough to use the magnetic base to mount the antennas on to the top of your desktop/tower for improved reception.
2,Windows 10 picked it up and found a driver for it. Just started working after physical install.  I am using it with a Fios G3100 wifi router that is unfortunately not 160mhz capable. this limits the speed to 1.2Gb.All  the speed numbers are given with "little b" i.e. Megabits Gigabits...It is hard to know how much of the underwhelming performance is the G3100 and how much the card.The driver that comes on the install dvd is ancient Intel has something much newer.  From 45 foot distance one wall in between same floor I get 700/600 Mbps (rcv/xmit varies) on the 5G radio after tweaking the hardware settings on the card a fair bit.  Same card in a different computer on the floor above  ( maybe 20 feet away) gets 1.2gb/1.2gb.  So the 5G is apparently rather sensitive to distance and noise.  If the computer goes to sleep it usually switches to the 2.4G network probably because of stronger signal and then uses wireless N typically 100Mb/100Mb or worse.  I have to disconnect and reconnect then it connects to the  5G radio.  Compare to the Rosewill AC  ( Wifi 5)  cards I used before I was getting 450Mb/450Mb at 45 feet consistently. In another computer I still use the Rosewill 5G ac  and I get 1.2G/1.2G using AC wuth the fios router consistently.  So: this card did not improve matters all that much if at all.  I am thinking about swapping it back to the Rosewill AC.  I am on the fence of swapping out the Wifi router to something that is 160Mhz channel capable.  If I do I will update the review.  Maybe the latency is better I have no way of measuring it.  Things that may interfere: Older fireTv boxes tend to use wifi to operate their remote so that causes an ugly interference peak.  Things got better when I turned that off..  Tp-link tech support was useless boldly asserting some obviously incorrect info such as "This card has no user configurable options" and "move your computer next to the router". Seriously?  Card config settings: routing aggressiveness to the lowest settings (the idea is to prevent it to decide to use to the 2.4G radio)   all power saving options disabled channel widths auto and prefer 5Ghz.  Of course you need to enable the AX standard.  Antenna settings: I found some info that V shape is best but I find "straight up" is better.
1,Upon reading many of the reviews on this product It appears this product has a very high chance of having problems in general.This leads me to believe TP-Link does not have very strict Quality Control.My unit was dead on arrival (DOA). Neither windows or my motherboard would not detect the device installed. Meaning that I couldn't even properly try the device.Seeing this I decided to give the warranty a shot I try to give manufacturers a second chance and this was the first time I purchased a product from TP-Link. So what's there to lose.The first tier support was great to work with. They assessed my issues and had them escalated within 30 minutes of initiating the help. Great maybe I'll get an RMA based on my situation.Now the next tier of support was rather... Interesting?... to say the least. I was connected with an engineer I guess which is a strange person to connect to. Any how I spent maybe 8 hours total (over the course of 2 days) troubleshooting this device for the engineer in ways that I wouldn't exactly expect the average user to know. This engineer just got lucky that they had a person who works on software for a living to do this troubleshooting.Troubleshooting directions (not posted by TP-Links official support site) include:- Installing the device on the secondary PCIex1 slot.- Installing the device on PCI x4 slots- Updating the BIOS on my motherboard (Granted there was a rather specific firmware update regarding PCIe device support)- Updating the windows Chipset Drivers- Trying various methods while in safe mode with networking enabled.- Removing VPN software (as apparently some VPN software will block new installs of network drivers)So all this did was make me believe I had a dead unit. Afterwards I decided it be best to not go through TP-Link and just try another manufacturer that offers the same thing. The Asus PCE-AX58BT and to no surprise the Asus variant worked flawlessly out the box. No joke it's the same Wireless/Bluetooth driver being installed. Also returning the product for a refund would be undoubtedly much faster than working with TP-Link RMA. Also an RMA isn't really worth doing on a new product anyways.TP-Links troubleshooting process paired with the device being defective made it feel like TP-Link was doing everything in it's power to prove that I was wrong and that I received a perfectly fine product. I'm pretty sure that was not the intent but it sure felt like it. When in reality I received something defective and they made it difficult to work with support.In short I spent 3 days with a dead unit. TP-Link is not a great company to work with on support. Reviews already indicate that this product has a high failure rate. So I highly recommend to avoid this product. It's obvious it's not ready for market and is in desperate need of a new revision.
4,I have the $100 ASUS with 4 antennae but I wanted BT so I gave this a shot. I also have a TP-Link router that is ax so wanted to see if this could compete. If you add in all factors this is better; it has BT a smaller profile w/ 2 antennae and costs half as much. Still I went back to the ASUS. I have a gig d/l and get 500-600 Mbps w/ ASUS and 300-400 w/ this rig. Solid but the ASUS clearly outperforms. Can't feel any discernible difference w/ ax vs ac or any other MU-MIMO factors but that doesn't mean they don't exist. Let's just say I am fine with doubling cost losing BT having this honking thing sticking out the side of my tower fiddling with the antennae to see which directions most often yield almost 600Mbps through 3 walls and about 20'. If you're that person get the ASUS. If you're not that person get this one. It's more flexible and good enough. If good enough isn't your thing then like do what I did I guess? :)
5,My old ass gaming rig couldn't recieve WiFi 6 now it can.
5,Very easy to install.  This comes with an install disc but I did not have a CD drive on my computer now did i have ethernet nearby to download the drivers. Luckily because i was in windows 10 my computer was able to recognize the wifi card immediately and I was able to connect to my wifi network. After that i just followed the link in the instructions to download the proper drivers.  I did not need the bluetooth capability for now do i just did not install the internal usb connector; the card works for wifi only no problem!I have a NZXT H500 case (midtower) and the included cord for the antenna base easily reaches the front of my case i just stick it to the front with the magnetic base.Great product I wanted an asus card but this tp link looks just as nice and works perfectly!
4,-BLUETOOTH REQUIRES MORE TESTING WITH VARIOUS DEVICES-As of right now this adapter has actually been the best PCIe card I've put into my PC. The Wifi 6 capabilities has been the best investment I've put into my PC after my Powerline adapter limited my connection to 10 mbps. I don't have any connection drops to the Wifi and the Magnet antenna doesn't look too bad on the side of my case.HOWEVER bluetooth can't keep an Xbox Series S controller connected for a damn and I could not explain to you why. I don't have any bluetooth earbuds to see if this is because of the bluetooth chip on this card or what so I'm only knocking it one star for the fact that I can't have a wireless controller hooked to the bluetooth.
5,The speed and signals this thing picks up are pretty impressive. I upgraded from a USB wifi adapter that was beginning to drop signals for some reason. This new card solved the issue for me and is easily able to pick up my router's signal from the opposite end and floor of a townhome.The only issue that I noticed and I think I saw in some of the other reviews too was that the Bluetooth functionality was difficult to set up. The physical connections are easy to make as it it just one small cable to attach from the card to the motherboard however the first 2-3 times I tried this it was not recognized as a bluetooth adapter. I was able to solve this by just disconnecting and reconnecting until it worked but the connections are pretty firm so it was a strange issue.
5,Overall I am satisified with this purchase it was easy to install made of quality material and effective. I bought this to replace a usb bluetooth adapter I was using on my pc and the difference is night and day. When I connect my Bluetooth headphones the signal is strong enough to get crystal clear sound quality no matter where I am in my house whereas before I was limited to a very small range. In fact I am able to listen to music on my computer from outside of my house. I havent test the wifi as much as I run an ethernet cable directly to my motherboard via ethernet but if the clarity and range is at least as good as the bluetooth is then I am satisfied.Either way if you are looking for a quality network adapter for your computer this is a very efficient choice especially considering the dramatic increase in price for one with even higher specs.
5,The photos show my before and after WiFi speed. The test was taken immediately before and after the install.I was connected via the Ethernet port but had to move around my computer and needed to use WiFi.I had just upgraded to 600 mb/s and was using a generic USB WiFi adapter.As you can see the speed available on the PC was substandard. I couldn’t get higher than 35 mb/s.The kit was a simple install. Open the PC remove the pcie card metal blank and plug in the card. Attach the Bluetooth cable to the motherboard and screw in the card and connect the antennas. Power up and install the drivers which are from Intel. I didn’t use the enclosed CD because I don’t have a CD drive anymore like most others.As you can see I’m getting a good speed now.There are some cheaper cards based on the same chipset but for the price difference I feel this card more appealing.Recommended.
5,Easy to install and works extremely well. I have Spectrum in south Texas. Only feasable internet choice over 100 mbps down here.I have 20 or so devices connected to my ax88u with a modem that I  pay for speeds of 500/20. With just the modem connected with Ethernet I get about 550/23.6.My computer is across the hall about 30 ft away and on average I get speeds of 500/23 on 5ghz! Never has it gone below 400/21. On 2.4 I get around 100/23 but that just fyi.I turned on the 160mhz in the GUI but didn't see much of a change. Not many 5 Ghz channels around me though and I don't have the band with to really push it enough. In the WiFi status window it does say 1.2 Gbps so there's that.I had a little trouble with the drivers that took about an hour to workout but I'm not going to deduct a star for that. No tech support was used.
5,I've only had this for a week now and what a difference it's made!I highly recommend internal WiFi adapters rather than those USB piles of junk.  I spent far too much time tinkering with a USB WiFi adapter from another company only to have it die after a couple months.This think though it worked immediately!  Windows had already recognized it and connected to my WiFi before I even had time to insert the driver CD!The magnetic antenna mount is a nice touch!  I mounted it to the side of my PC case.  It's barely noticeable and my signal strength is perfect!Good product would buy again.
2,Once I installed this card I noticed my Orbi router would periodically crash.  This never happen prior to the install of this card.  After many hours of trial and error I confirmed time and time again it is this combo.  If I use the old wifi card in the computer or use the ISP wifi access point with this new card the crash does not occur.  However the reason I purchased this was to take advantage of the WiFi 6 with the orbi - rendering the purchase of this card a waste of money for my situation.
4,I don’t think my household has very poor WiFi connection and unfortunately even with this item my pc lost connection quite a few times. I also dont love the bright red component but that’s not something that could be helped when I chose to buy this product. I wish there were other color options. I build a white aesthetic PC and this component sticks out like a sore thumb. Otherwise it appears to be functioning in the ways it should I’m hoping the connectivity issues don’t persist.
5,I have TP-Links Deco X60 Wifi 6 mesh network and was only getting 150mbps on my old 802.11ac USB adapter.  In order to get Wifi 6 speeds you need a PCIe card wifi adapter or a m.2 card slow adapter.  My case was a little tight so I had to remove my video card and stuff but overall easy to install aside from my case issues. That is no fault of the product.  The antennas doubled my previous signal quality reduced latency from 27ms to 13ms and took my bandwidth from 150mbps download all the way to 386mbps.  My internet is up to 500mbps Spectrum.  So that was likely the max speed I could get from it. Quality of signal has greatly improved as well.
4,This is a fantastic card; once I got it working. My old WiFi Card gave me speeds of 87 Mbps. With this WiFi Card I pulled 120 Mbps and that is the cap my ISP limits me to. It was easy enough to install. Just make sure you have an extra F-USB connector on your motherboard and the drivers beforehand if you don't have a DVD drive. Also the drivers that TP-Link gives you are drivers are for an Intel WiFi 6 AX200 160Mhz card and they are outdated. It kept on disconnecting itself every 20 minutes or so. It was very frustrating trying to find out what the heck was wrong.  Then I went on Intel's website and download the latest drivers for their Intel WiFi 6 AX200 160Mhz card and now it works like a dream. Please update the drivers on your website TP-Link.
5,worked much better than USB
5,Not sure what all the fuss is over this card but TP-Link did a great job here.The heat sink color and everything about it is great.The antenna are the same from their router line. Strong and pickup and send out well.Wish the cord was a little longer.Over-all I'm getting the best performance out of this card than I have with 2 other options.No disconnects at all here.  I'm a good 25 feet away from my AX router as well.  There is also 2 walls a door and other things that it goes through.As you can see with my speed test the rates are good!  My current plan has me at 400/20.Very happy.Oh and I streamed youtube for the last 2 days without issues! were talking gigs of data!
5,I was using wifi and Bluetooth dongles on my desktop computer. The connections seemed fine but on my Zoom calls I was getting freezes despite excellent Speedtest results.. Speedtest showed 200 MBS but the ping utility showed frequent freezes despite excellent wifi speed. I installed this card and the freezes have disappeared on Zoom. Bluetooth does seem to work better as well. The only problem I had with installation was that I hadn't realized that I needed to plug the card into an internal USB port on the motherboard for the Bluetooth to work. My initial reaction was that the motherboard did not have an internal USB port but closer examination with a flashlight and a magnifying glass revealed that there was in fact an internal USB port labelled as such in tiny letters.
5,Easy to install if you know anything about computers.  Super easy if you built your own.I put in the card attached the USB connector and connected the antennas.Booted up and installed the drivers for both WiFi and BT.Ran a speed test (see pic).I have a 1-Gbit connection and an Asus RT-AX56U router.Wi-Fi connected right away via 5 GHz band.Bluetooth was up as soon as the driver was installed.My desktop is about 30 feet from router in the next room.I had downloaded the drivers from the TP-Link website beforehand.No more 25 Ft ethernet cable to deal with and my speed is almost as fast as it was using CAT 6 cable.Totally satisfied!From opening the box to being up and online only about 15 or 20 minutes (and I'm old and slow).
5,3 rooms and 3 walls away and it gets a strong signal! I only gave tech support 3 stars because I don't have any experience with using them. Hopefully I will never need to.
4,I purchased two of these and I can say that they do work surprisingly well.  My one issue is that my husband and I’d mobos both have onboard WiFi and Bluetooth while this product does not interact well with.  When installed my computer bluescreened on startup with the error saying there was an issue with a networking driver.  I took the card out installed the drivers then put the card back in.  The WiFi worked then but the Bluetooth didn’t actually work.  I checked and it said there were problems and the device couldn’t be started.  So I can’t really say if it was truly good or not but it definitely doesn’t work if you have onboard WiFi and Bluetooth that you can’t disable in the bios.
4,...the coax cables for the antenna are too damn short. Unless you like the idea of two large powerful earth magnets attached to the side of your desktop computer you are limited to putting your case somewhere other than where you may want it. In my situation my case is inside a custom credenza on a pull out shelf.Not being one who likes powerful magnets on my computer case I have to find and purchase extension cables. It seems logical that cables longer than 18" would be on this "remote antenna base" or at the very least offered as an accessory from the manufacturer.That would be "thinking ahead" rather than putting everyone in the same box and not offering a simple option. Because of this a 5 star goes to a 3 star and that's being generous.
4,I bought this wifi card to free up some USB ports.  It takes the place of my USB Bluetooth &  Wifi Dongle. So anyway my ISP provides download speeds up to 120 mbps.  This card does that fine. My gripe is that my USB Netgear dongle did too and it did it consistently better.  For example when I start Speedtest.net the needle shoots to the MAX with my USB dongle.  But with the TP-Link AX3000 it starts off at 30 mbps and gradually climbs/builds up speed till it reaches 120 mbps.  That's a very small gripe but I wish I knew how to configure it so it performs as well as my USB wifi does.  Wifi Works and Bluetooth works.  As of this writing I've had the thing for less than 24 hours :)
5,I am getting super fast wifi speeds and a Bluetooth as a bonus I needed to move a PC to a location in the house where it doesn't have an ethernet cable connection and came across this wifi card very happy with the results also gave me a chance to clean the inside of my tower as I was installing the wifi card. Highly recommended.Update: I had to remove a couple of stars for the inconsistency in the signal I am getting. I have uninstalled/ reinstalled and updated the driver with no luck when it connected its super fast but I have to restart my computer several times throughout the day to get the connection back.Update: I increased the star rating again after finding the problem wasn't with this card but rather my router I am getting full wifi speeds.
5,I had previously purchased a Wifi 6 Intel AX200 based card and it worked well on my new FiOS 500/500 internet with an Amplify Alien. However I soon realized there are other models of Wifi 6 cards especially one like this TP-Link Wifi 6 AX3000 that has an extendable antenna which is 3 feet 3 inches.  On the Amplify software my desktop which is about 40 feet from the Alien router I was getting 61% connection at 600mpbs transfer rate (LAN). This new one I am getting 69% (nice) connection at 850mbps.  This has helped me get about 75mpbs more Internet speed going to closer to 300mbps down and 400mbps up from 200/200 on the previous wifi 6 card I had.  Also this has a heatsink which may not be needed. Packaging was also really nice. Worth the difference of $8 so I've returned the previous card.
5,Had a 15$ card from eBay prior to this that was sold 1600 times in past year. I had low speedtest inconsistent from 5mbps to max 55mbps and a lot of times I would just lose signal. Tried bigger antennas angles updates moving the router and every trick in my sleeve. Nothing.Eventually I decided to try this card out and sure enough signal is doubled from the old card and speedtest is consistent at 90-92mbps..Ethernet cable speed is 120ish but considering the fact there are 2 walls and good 40ft distance I think it was a good improvement and well spent money.Card was plug and play everything works including Bluetooth(requires usb slot on the motherboard).I am using 2x 9dbi 12" antennas on it..works like a charm!Would recommend!
5,I had a USB BlueTooth  and separate Wifi Dongle. They delivered poor performance. performance.The wifi ran at 12m while my cell phone ran at 32m. When I loaded the computer to 100% the headphone output would cut in and out and then the dongles were fragile.This unit fixed ALL of that. It delivered as advertised and now I'm running 32 m on wifi and the Headphones don't cut out.  Installation was easy too.  I was afraid I had already used up all my USB headers but I found a spare one.My only problem (if you can call it that) is that the supplied antenna extension is too short to let me place the antennas on the top of my Computer desk.  It does not seem to affect performance though.I can recommend this product. Just be sure your MOBO has a free PCIE slot and an available USB header.
5,Received product with no problem The install was easy didn't take more then 10-15 minutes to put it in the system connecting the Bluetooth was fast and simple but before I installed I downloaded the software since reading the other reviews out the box the speeds are terribly it. My speeds increased from about 340mbs to 560mbs which is about the my max internet speed. I have had no disconnections or WI-FI drops. I've only been using it for a bit over a month currently. The Bluetooth works for my ps4 controller haven't tried it for audio So all in all I'd recommend it based on my current experience with it.
4,This card installed easily except that the bracket didn't line up well with my case/mobo combo (standard NZXT mid tower case and Gigabyte mobo) and required a slight bend in order to screw in correctly (minus one star for that).  The Windows native driver seems to perform just as well as the included driver.  Consistently shows ping 3 mid 500s Mbps down and mid 400s Mbps up (gigabit service Orbi Wifi 6 mesh system with nearest node in the same room about 25 feet away).  A family member uses this card in his apartment as well and we are both very satisfied.
5,After struggling with my Netgear A7000 for months breaking literally every time a new linux kernel dropped I finally spent the money for this upgrade. I plugged it in it instantly recognized the card and it was good to go. It's fast and stable so far reaches my office no problem. I don't know what more I could ask for from it. I didn't test or care about the Bluetooth so no comment there.I should mention this product IS just an Intel AX200NGW on a pci-e adapter. The heatsink doesn't touch the card and seems to exist just to take up space. It's difficult to photograph the gap but I don't expect it to generate much heat regardless.
5,This wireless card is by far the best card I've ever used. It allows my computer to take full advantage of the gigabit speeds. It has reliable connection with the router 2 walls away.The red heat sinks look really cool. It matches the red that "gamer" components usually have. The antennae looks high quality but the best part is the magnetic base. That's some find detail oriented thinking that their R&D team had.The CD that they include for the driver is a little wonky. Not many people use CD drives anymore so I had to rip out an old CD drive from another computer to install it. Then it didn't even work. Save yourself from a headache and just get the drivers online stick it in a flash drive and install it that way.
5,My router is downstairs in my living room whereas my desktop is upstairs. My old wifi pcie card had the antenna attached to it and the back of my desktop had poor reception; this new external antenna is much better as I can mount it to the side of my case. The receiver also seems much more powerful; my connection is now more stable and my wifi speeds have increased from about 20 Mbps to 180 Mbps over the 5G connection (I'm paying for 200 Mbps but even a wired connection usually doesn't reach 200). Also getting low latency. Highly recommended.
5,The biggest appeal to me for this card was the external antenna base and it exceeded expectations.Card installation was a breeze although it does require a free USB header on your motherboard for Bluetooth this wasn't important for me. The drivers automatically installed and the card was working out of the box.Screwed in the base to the card and it felt heavier than expected when I picked it up. Very well built.Do you need to get wifi to your computer or a blunt force object to assault home intruders? With the TP-LINK WiFi 6 AX3000 card you no longer need to make that decision.One star deducted for the Bluetooth issue but 4.5/5 otherwise.
4,I bought this because my computer is in an odd spot. I have a metal-framed computer desk. With the standard wifi cards the antennae are at the back of the computer. Since my desk has a metal frame this causes a lot of interference and I have terrible connection speeds and reliability. I like TP Link as a brand. I think they make quality products. I found this through a search for wifi cards with external antennas.When it arrived I installed it and placed the antenna base with antennas on top of my desk. So far it has fixed all the aforementioned problems. I am now getting a ton more bandwidth and the reliability is also greatly improved. No more dropped connections and the throughput is equal to a wired connection.Would definitely recommend.
5,Works great for years
4,Compared to my previous model the Archer T9E the signal is better and speed seems faster. I'm getting closer the three bandwidth limit of my isp issues wifi 5 modem/router combo. Lowest speed I've seen is 351Mb/s and the highest being 786 Mb/s.Drivers used were on the websitethough windows 10 did detect and install drivers of its own initially.
5,I purchased this for my desktop to add Bluetooth support and upgrade from a USB WiFi adapter which did not support the full upload/download speed of my WiFi.It was plug and play with an easy driver install from the TP-Link website. After running a speed test I am now seeing the full speed of my internet connection around 500 Mbps up and down where the old adapter was limited to about 200 Mbps down and 50 Mbps up.Bluetooth seems to work great. I have four devices attached to it including my phone keyboard mouse and headphones with no issues so far.The magnetic antenna base is stronger than I thought it would be and really nice for attaching it to the top of my desktop.I'm very happy with this product so far and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new WiFi card!
5,I bought one of these for my work desktop a while back and more recently a second for my home desktop.The quality is awesome I do online gaming with it and you'd never know you didn't have a wired connection. The bluetooth is a nice plus as well it's not something I use regularly but it's nice to have the option.My favorite thing about it though is that it has plug-and-play compatibility with most Linux distros. On the inside it uses an Intel chipset the driver for which is included right on the ISO of most of the popular distros (Ubuntu Mint MX Arch Fedora Manjaro etc.).Would be even better if the driver was fully open-source rather than a freely redistributable binary blob but that's still a step ahead of most other chipmakers
5,Hadn't needed to call tech support it was pretty straightforward I don't have a CD tray on my computer but it was easy enough to just go to the site and download the drivers. Bluetooth connect with no problem and wifi speed are amazingly granted I'm only sitting about 15ft away in the other room but still I get about 600mbps to 700mbps download and about 350mpbs to 400mbps upload and I'm paying for a Gig so on wifi I couldn't be happier I work as a field tech for a cable company and I know what realistic results are to and what's be expected out of wifi so yea this pretty impressive especially just coming straight out the AT&T equipment I'm using
5,Couple things you should know. There is a cd that the driver is on. The card needs to plugged into a usb header on the mother board. Install the driver first before installing the hardware. Restart your pc after installing the driver. The extended antenna seems to make no difference in the speed the card will result when speed testing the card. This card works with the Asus Maximus hero vi motherboard. The card only works with windows 10. So far i have had no issues with the card. I will test this card with some Battlefield 4 and will post my results.
3,I bought this product looking for an internal bluetooth adapter. I was happy to have found an internal card I could use for both bluetooth and ass a wireless adapter. Physical installation was simple. Software installation was a little trickier; I couldn't get full functionality from the card (mainly utilizing Windows 10 Mobile Hotspot) until I had installed all widows updates including the optional ones. Now I have one more kink to work out.Every time I install an update or install software that requires a system restart my PC will not see the card after loading back up. I need to shutdown my  PC unplug from power unplug the card and plug the card back in again before my PC will see it again. Most of the time I'll only need to re-seat the card once but occasionally after re-seating the card I will get a blue screen error on start-up "SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION - KS.SYS" requiring me to repeat the process again. The blue screen error doesn't make a lot of sense because as I understand it KS.SYS relates to on-board cameras.I'll get a hold of the manufacturer and see what solutions they can provide. If they can help and fix this issue I'll gladly up my review; however I may in my troubleshooting find that the issue lies somewhere else maybe with my older motherboard (2012).
5,I will not get into the technical side of things. This is simply an amazing wifi card. My old card was actually great as well but this one is just slightly faster and completely stable.The current plan I pay for is 200 MBps and I am getting download speeds of around 240 LOL!Maybe it is normal to be a little over but 40MBps over seems like I am getting a huge boost.I cannot guarantee those numbers to anyone else. That is what I am experiencing and I am loving it.
4,Would have given 5 stars but the Bluetooth feature uses the only usb header that isn't for the front 3.1 header. So I had to buy an adapter but other than that it's been perfect. No complaints as far as the performance. It picks up better than the old WiFi adapter I had for ac WiFi connections.
4,Added this to my kid's computer after we upgraded our router. She maxes out our ISP's bandwidth and she can nearly instantly load all the content from our plex server. Can't ask for much more than that.If you're using this as a bluetooth receiver beware its REALLY difficult to get this setup in windows 10. Google "CSR 4 Robert Papp" if you want the driver since the one's on TP-Link's website didn't work for me.
4,Muy buen adaptador wifi va full la velocidad la instalación es facil mi gran queja aqui es que no me trajo el cable para conectar el bluetooth escribi al soporte y solo me decían que no me podian mandar el cable solo si no que tenia que enviar el producto para atras para que me mandaran otro nuevo y no lo puedo hacer porque estoy muy lejos lo mas facil pienso yo es que me madaran el cable ellos.
5,Edit-(a_week_later-original_below)Wow this has really improved my internet and I was surprised just how faster my downloads have been and also I received a notification from windows confirming wifi 6 support. Bottom line- get it! I had a usb plug AC wifi adapter good thing I did get this because when I went to pull out the old usb adapter it seperated from the usb sleeve. Anyway installation was a breeze in my case with one screw taking in and out. It doubled my speed & as far as I can tell Bluetooth is working nice and solid. I'd recommend it if your on the fence trying to make a decision.
4,...but at first I was on tech support with my big cable provider with general wifi issues and after being leveled up with tech support it was determined that something wasn't playing nice with their wifi 6 in their latest modem. We rolled that back and the TP-Link worked great as did the rest of my network well at least better than before.
5,I can't think of the last time I plugged my computer into a wall for internet access so WiFi Speed is very important.  This device upgraded me from WiFi 5 to WiFi 6 which makes a huge difference.  In addition it comes with Bluetooth 5.0 which is much better than 4.2.  My only wish would be for it to come with an Apt X HD Audio Chip but that would be too perfect!Given the latest hacks by nefarious nations - I also wanted a brand like TP that was U.S. Based and very Reputable.
5,I bought this to put my desktop PC on my wireless network so I'd be able to use it with my Steam Link wirelessly as well.  Previously I had my PC connected to my network by powerline ethernet and was getting up 100 Mbps but it could be and was at times unreliable.  After installing this card and testing it it was pulling over 100 Mbps.In testing with my Steam Link it appears to work well when I'm streaming at 1080p.  I did a bit of testing at 1440p but the specific game Trails of Cold Steel seems to frequently crash when running over 1080p.  I'll update my review if/when I can test reliably at 1440p and 4K and try out the Bluetooth capabilities.  For now I'm very pleased when the product.
5,This WiFi card works great using the antenna base I get the maximum my provider gives with my plan being 100MBps but I get 110 or even 115MBps. Not only that but the signal is going through multiple walls a bathroom a bedroom and the walls of the room the PC is in. It was pretty easy to install and TP Link provides an easy to understand guide if needed.
4,Never could get this device working.  Fresh install of Windows 10.  It was detected by Windows but was unable to start (code 10).  Returning with prejudice.EDIT:The replacement I bought failed with code 10 also.After resetting the BIOS to factory defaults the replacement card worked just fine.I put this card back in and am very happy with the results getting 600Mbps down / 400Mbps up.Cannot give it 5 stars because of the complete lack of helpful documentation about this problem.Gear ASRock B450M PRO4 motherboard AMD RYZEN 5 3600 CPU NETGEAR Nighthawk AX12 router.
5,Like it’s not gonna make the internet better if it’s trash to begin with then buy summ else. But if you’re positive you bought the premium package and it’s still slow then you prolly should get this
5,This thing is fantastic. I ordered a gaming pc without a wireless card in it so I cold choose myself. The room I wanted it in is a room I can't permanently install an ethernet cable in. I can run one if I need to but I don't want to. Anyway I didn't want slow download speeds (I'm not a competitive gamer I only play by myself) and boy did this do the trick. Downloading at about 450mbps is plenty fast for me. And that's all the way across the house through lots of walls and closets. 10/10 would buy again.
3,Functions well but seller sent a 'used-like new' item that had an antenna broken off. I'm lucky I don't need that extension for my tower but I'm not happy with this particular seller.
5,I Love this thing so far just needed to plug into my USB slot on the MB then insert the card into the pcie slot.  From the back end an antenna with about 5 to 6 foot worth of antenna cable can be dropped in to your PC and mounted.  For added bonus I didn't even know that this came with a magentic base so to my pleasure I was able to mount this antenna off the back of my monitor mounting assembly and it blends in very well with the environment while mounting as high as possible.  Great coverage and I'm able to pull in all of my bluetooth/Wifi connections.  Less wires and less fuss.  Even connected my Xbox Wireless controller to it.
5,Couldn't get this working on a PCI-e x16 slot but it worked on a PCI-e x1 slot.Tried re-installing drivers updating BIOS etc. before I just switched it to a smaller slot. It does block a bit of airflow to my GPU but temps don't seem to be affected much.I only pay for around 150 mpbs and this hits 130 mpbs consistently on my speedtests. My ping lately has been hovering around 12 ms but I have seen it climb a bit higher. Altogether not bad.Happy that this includes bluetooth as well.
5,I really love this wifi card! it has worked faithfully since i installed it and i predict it’ll continue to work for as long as i need it. Instructions were pretty easy to follow and install was a breeze. Definitely recommend.
5,After bought $ returned other wifi adapter I tried one more time with this. It worked!  Easy installation to PCIE slot.  As soon as my computer was turned on WiFi located my home wifi.  No separate driver installation or update was needed.  The speed check was pulling over 450mbps down and 300 mbps up (i have fios 400/400).  Bluetooth works well.  On top of all these it was delivered within 5 hours of placing my order.  This item works!!!
4,I've read a lot of reviews and seems like a lot of people are complaining about the downgrade in wifi signal because they don't have a wifi 6 router. I also don't have a wifi 6 router and found that my signal stability decreased.I think I've found a fix for this and its pretty simple.1) Open network settings2) Change adapter options3) right click your wireless adapter and open properties.4) Under networking click the configure button.5) Go to the advanced tab and click the 802.11n/ac/ax wireless mode.6) look at the "value" drop down menu and select 802.11n (mine started on 802.11 ax)After I did this my wifi stability returned to normal.
4,I just set it up and it works great. You don't have to attach the antenna but the signal is much better with it. Without the antenna attached I got 70mb/s with it I got the full 400 that I pay for. After installing it I cannot get it to sit tightly (at least not enough so that it doesn't wiggle just a bit) but it isn't enough movement to cause issues. It comes with installation instructions too!
4,If it were not for the fact that the first unit delivered had problems this would be a five star review. The unit delivers excellent results on a single 5.0 GHZ radio. I will be experimenting with the dual radio setup and I fully expect that to be well above 1GB performance. The hardware installation is very straightforward and the software and drivers install was a snap. I would highly recommend this solution as an effective way to add years of functional life to my 5 year old Lenovo Think Centre desktop
5,This device is amazing and I live in a 1500 sqft apartment. The router is on one side of my apartment and the device is in my room on the other side of the apartment and I get full signal even through 3 walls. Very rarely does it drop below 3 out of 4 bars and the load speed is great.
4,Can't say if price is right but the signal and functionality is great.  Have it in family room about 15 direct feet from the office room.  The walls do nothing signal is perfect.
5,This is coming from a Powerline Ethernet user. The electrical wiring in my home is aged and not the best for powerline. Since joining a Fiber-Optic ISP my powerline adapters coupled with my aging home hardware would get me nowhere close to the 300/300 Mbps speeds on upload/download I should be getting. I went from around 50Mbps Down and 80Mbps Up on Powerline to over 150Mbps on both. Further impressive considering the Wifi signal is from downstairs in my home and has to go through a few walls to get to me.The card is very easy to install. If you have built a PC before you know that installing PCIe cards are simple.
5,I got this to work in under 30 minutes and most of that time was trying to figure out how to open the desktop and clear a PCIe slot for the installation.Wifi runs as fast as a wired connection at the maximum speed for my particular Xfinity setup.  Bluetooth lets me roam around the house a bit unlike the old mini adapter that didn't let me go outside the home office.  After a week of use there has been no drops in the connections either Wifi or BT.  I am very happy.
5,I'm an IT guy by trade so installing this was easy for me. It is slightly more challenging than plugging in a USB device but not had at all.  The wifi works but speed is bit an issue for me so I cant speak to that.  I bought this for the Bluetooth capability and it works great.  I was hoping the added signal strength for the Bluetooth 5 would solve my issue with my bike trainer and Zwift.  I am pleased to say I have not had one single drop out since I upgraded to this card.  I'm very pleased with my smart trainer (Tacx Neo 2T) and how it is working with Zwift.
4,While installing the device was easy enough and everything works as intended. However the only complaint I have about the product is the cables that attach the receiver to the chip itself are a little shorter than I myself would like. That being said I would definitely recommend getting this product if you need to upgrade your Wi-Fi and as a bonus want Bluetooth connection.
5,Up to this point I was using a decent ASUS wireless USB port (USB-AC68). With the new Xfinity router  it was giving me download speeds of ~88Mbps and uploads ~5 Mbps. This new TP-Link device made it 520/17 Mbps respectively more than 5x improvement on download and over 3x on upload. The installation was simple (if you are comfortable with opening your computer and adding things to the MB). I downloaded drivers directly from TP-Link site (prior to installation) and it all worked well right from the start. Very happy with this product. Make sure to hook up the device to MB USB port if you plan on using Bluetooth.
5,This is a PCIe card which installs directly to your motherboard.  If this is not your bailiwick then please ensure you have an open compatible slot with access to power from the board.  I used this card in my home office approx 20' from the router.  Connection has always been great and speed is slightly above my ISP's guaranteed mbps.  Throughput is similarly strong.  I frequently use it for ZOOM / Skype meetings during the day and gaming (BDO CoH Destiny 2) at night (mostly . . .) and never have any problems even in large groups.  Ping generally runs 7-9ms.  It is a great card exactly what I needed and I feel weird that I paid only $45 for it.
5,I'll keep it short.  A one armed chimpanzee could be trained to install this wifi card into any desktop computer.  You could pay him with bananas.  Might take a little more than a trained primate to install the drivers from the TP Link product support page but it's hardly difficult.Went from 100Mbps to well over 400Mbps moving up from a TP Link powerline adapter.It's a no-brainer @ $50 if your wifi router has Wi-Fi ac or ax.
5,First of all it works and it works really really well. If you're looking for a strong card with a strong antenna this is it. However if you have never opened a computer... this might not be the best thing to start on. You will have to install it and troubleshoot it yourself. Should be plug-and-play but buyer beware that it does NOT have an ethernet port. This means you will have to download the drivers on a different computer or make sure your mobo has a port. Good luck!
4,No issues to really report except that you need to download the driver for it which requires the PC to have internet connection. It does come with a CD but I don't own a portable CD drive. Solution? dragged the PC monitor and keyboard to the router and used a hardline to update the driver to accept the wifi card. After that no problems.
4,went from having 10mbps from other cards to 321mbps and easy to install though there was some trouble with the Bluetooth drivers that i couldn't quite resolve as of 6/10 it also has a cool red finish to it :)
4,Hi all  This card worked great for a couple of weeks then now I only get 40 Mbps when it was at 220 Mbps i have tried everything even reinstalling Windows 10 .Update i figured out that it was a driver that was not playing well  .  Intel needs to update there drivers for this card . I am getting 220 mbps again so everything is cool. One note the antenna cord could be a little longer.
5,When I built my pc last fall I bought a cheap plug-and-play USB WiFi adapter. It consistently gave me around 20-30 Mbps which I was satisfied with until recently. Then I bought this WiFi adapter and after a quick and easy installation I was instantly getting speeds around 400Mbps. I don't know how I ever used the other adapter. This was instantly a massive upgrade and did not cost all that much more than my original low-quality USB adapter.
5,This wifi card was immediately auto-detected by Windows 10 as well as the bluetooth. I have an ASUS ROG Strix motherboard and I just plugged the bluetooth into a free USB cable port on it. I'm getting great speeds although I'm admittedly in the same room with the router. Bluetooth quality is great with Bose headphones too. Nice having an all-in-one package. I downloaded the tplink official drivers also but I'm not sure if it was even necessary. Anyway would definitely recommend this.
5,If you want to enjoy the benefits of a PCI-Express network card with support for the Wi-Fi 6 standard at a reasonable price TP-Link Archer TX3000E is a great choice. You get high performance when using Wi-Fi 6 and excellent driver support for Windows 10. Another benefit is that I can also use it to connect Bluetooth devices to my PC. Overall TP-Link Archer TX3000E is an excellent choice for anyone switching their wireless network to the Wi-Fi 6 standard.TP-Link Archer TX3000E can offer stunningly fast wireless transfers on the 5 GHz band when using the Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) standard however you need to get a good Wi-Fi 6 router to let it fly.
5,I don't game but I do occasionally stream live TV on a second monitor while I work from home. Had to move the home office into a different room away from the router and was looking for a WiFi card. Got this 5 months ago and haven't noticed a change in my computer's performance. It was a -tad- finicky to install initially. Had to install try re-install try again etc. After maybe an hour of tinkering got it to work and haven't looked back.If you have ever installed anything in your own tower this shouldn't be a problem. Well worth the money to make the desktop movable and not dependent on being next to the router.
5,Tried a few different options to increase the speed on the desktop upstairs but nothing worked well. Tried the TP-Link AX3000 and this definitely did the trick! I have Google Fiber 1gb and with Google's Wifi point I'm averaging 200mb download and 180mb upload speeds. Able to play COD with no lag on wireless! Installation is a breeze and no issues so far while continuous use for 3 months.
5,I initially had the antennas installed directly on the card (Just like my old one that failed after several years) and the signal kept dropping and losing connection.  Was ready to send it back when I decided to try the remote antenna extension. BAM! Perfect connection. Several days with zero issues and my speed is much faster than with my old ASUS. Out of curiosity I tried to put the antennas back on the card and ran into the same connection issues (had no issues with connection having antennas on card with old unit up until it failed) So don't know whats up with that but its working great so no complaints.
5,Activated my network and bluetooth capability without any problems. Mostly I use 5GHz band and it has been working flawlessly. The bluetooth capability seems to be working great however I have only tested it my cheap headphones so not sure if it works flawlessly but so far it has been working ok. Very easy to install- Literally plug anh play.
4,Got the same speed with my old pcie. dont recommend changes if you have a good old wifi 5 pcie OR slow internet speed package like 200mbps because there will be the same.Guess MAYBE signal will be better. MAYBEI will test it out to see signal differences and bluetooth signal. will be update this reviewI have Asus wifi 5 pcie bought 2 years ago. Have Wifi 6 Asus router (cheapest model). the router in middle of the house and my room at one end of the house.
4,The maximum bus speed of the PCIe 3.0 1x slot is 985 megabytes per second. The maximum usb 2.0 bus speed is 60 megabytes per second. The card does what it says it will but not to the extent of surpassing the standards that constrain it. Be forewarned that the theoretical maximum transfer rate of wifi 6 advertised as procurable by this device is downright misleading and any claims of 300 megabytes per second transfer rates when the whole device is more than likely just using PCIe for power and usb for transfer are completely impossible. Its a decent wifi card though I won't fault it for that.
5,Just got this card today and I already love it! It was super easy to install in my gaming pc and worked off the bat. I mainly use ethernet but wanted to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for the future. I highly suggest this card especially because it is on sale right now which makes it even better! It has a nice subtle red color which doesn't stick out too much incase you have a color themed build. It is completely hidden by my graphics card as well. Again you should get this card if you want Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5 all for a good price!
5,Easy enough to install- clicked right into place and just need to connect one wire. No issues with bluetooth or wifi connectivity but I don't game on it so I couldn't comment on latency.
5,I decided to replace my old WiFi adapter for my desktop because it was only getting 30 Mb/s. My internet service is supposed to be 1 Gb/s but the 5 GHz signal has to go through a few walls to get to my computer so I wouldn't expect to achieve 1 Gb/s. Still my phone and laptop regularly get 200 to 300 Mb/s in the same location as my desktop so I was pretty sure my old wifi adapter needed to be upgraded. Installation (both hardware and software) was straight forward and now I'm getting 500 Mb/s which I'm happy with.
4,The card was easy to install and I'm getting consistent access but reception is a little spotty at times.  With the  external antennas you would think that the reception would be 5/5 but I'm getting 3 bars most times and it's probably only 30 ft away from the router. The router is downstairs and computer is upstairs though. Other than that no complaints. Able to download and upload pretty fast.
5,was set on the Asus version of these wifi 6 cards but amazon doesn't carry them and they are $70. This one rocks my connection with the antennas is 20ft from router and screaming fast now. so sweet to have bluetooth also. I have a gaming pc that was 3600$ and it didn't even have bluetooth lol. Not sure why i bought that pc bc i dont even game. its future proofed now. bought the 3100 asus router on amazon for $140. Get this router its cheap and Mesh and wifi 6 for that price. I am using wifi 6 with gig speed WAVE internet. 2021 ready freddy!!
5,Extremely easy to install high quality wifi and bluetooth. Download the drivers BEFORE you uninstall your previous adapter or mobo if you don't have a CD slot. Or have someone send you them from a different device. Works great. Antennas are magnetic and kinda big but look good for what they are.
5,#1. you do NOT need to plug in the USB / Bluetooth - you can simply insert card into a PCIE slot - this comes up for many Dell m/bs with not open USB slot - not even sure what the bluetooth fuction is....???#2. am indeed getting 400+ mb/sec - such is obviously dependent on your provider - but if i test my iphone (XS) it only gets ~185 mb/sec -indeed improved from the stock "OEM" dell / killer internal wifi card - excellent upgrade and full use of my bandwidth (what i am already paying for).
5,I have the title all uppercase so people notice it since I just took a leap of faith with this as I couldn't find a definitive comparison of speeds or improvement thereof when comparing USB adapters to a PCIe wifi card. I'm getting much better speeds better range and the fastest speed was around 220 Mbps on my 350 Mbps internet (Ethernet will still be noticably faster as usual). A bit on the pricey side but you're getting the futureproof wifi 6 compatible card which will last you long in the future. I can see why people love TP-Link so much and I'll have to buy more of their products in the future.
5,Why do the antennas smell like those chocolate pencils I'd get back in middle school? It's not a problem unless it's just me?I bought a few other wifi cards before settling on this one. All the cheapy's seem to lack signal strength in one form or another. Either they'd fluctuate wildly with my bandwidth or they'd all but lose bluetooth connectivity while playing games. Coughing up a little extra cash is worth it in this scenario..
5,I’m new to building computers and this one was both easy to install and easy to make work. My room is as far as I could be from the router in my house through a floor and a few walls and I am getting ~210 mbps which is amazing given that the max my phone can get is 60 mbps. Bluetooth works great too and the whole thing is a steal.
5,I got this for my gaming desktop; because the motherboard didn't have built in wireless. It came with a CD with the drivers needed but unable use it a visit to the TP-Link website and downloading the correct drivers fixed that. After installing the drivers and slotting the card in the computer is able to connect to the WiFi without the antennas (still recommend using them though)! Downloading an app on my phone made it possible to connect it to my PC via bluetooth.
5,Bought this to extend internet to someone's PC without wireless capabilities in a finished basement where running a cable would be a serious headache.  Plugged this in and set the substantial antenna on the desktop and I had a 120M connection downstairs everything the router upstairs had.  Super easy loaded the drivers off the disk (as the pc had no internet until then) and it connected immediately.  This is for Win 10 64 bit version only so make sure what version you have as it claims will not work on win 10 32 bit.
5,We needed a WiFi card for a PC in a “fringe” signal area of the house. The $20 USB WiFi dongle that was previously used didn’t have a great signal pickup (plus it failed just after the return window closed). This card and antenna work great and instead of 50mbps we’re getting over 350mbps at the same location. The added Bluetooth is a plus. 5 stars would buy again no questions asked.Remember there are so many factors that can influence WiFi so a solution that works well for someone may not work as well for someone else. Depends on what type of signal your router outputs distance composition of your walls your internet speed etc.
5,I recently got gigabit internet and was only getting around 25Mbps down on my desktop which is about 50 feet from the wireless router. I replaced the old Roswell USB antenna with this card. Now I'm getting around 500Mbps...so quite a difference. "Hardest" part was connecting the card to an internal USB jack...I had to break out the manual for the board because I haven't looked at it in a couple of years. So for $50 I'm getting 20X the download speed and can pair bluetooth accessories - that's a good investment and I can reuse this card in future builds years down the road.
5,I have been using TPLink USB Wifi adapters for years.  I tried a card before and even though it had antennas off the back it was worse than the USB units.  However I usually leave the desktop on and they proved unreliable.  They would just drop the signal and go dead for a few minutes  randomly which was quite annoying. This product with its remote antennas has completely cured my problems.  I had even invested $250 in Mesh wifi extenders to enhance my signal.  I was actually able to remove the extender I had in my office while still maintaining excellent signal strength.
4,Works great for me!  I replaced a Rosewill AC-1900 and the TP Link AX3000 works well!  I have my desktop in an upstairs room and the WiFi reception was poor.  The AX3000 boosts the signal and now I get 400Mbs where I used to get 200Mbs.  With the Bluetooth I now use my Bose headphones and it’s great.  Very pleased.  Thumbs up and has my recommendation.
4,For a wifi adapter it keeps a pretty strong connection. Of course it isn't perfect and has some stuttering from time to time but overall works very well. It was a little tricky to install at first since I originally intended to install it in a different 1x slot below other expansions but it only seemed to work in the topmost 1x slot which was fine and most likely a fault of the motherboard. Overall I would definitely recommend it for the price.
5,Very easy to install on Windows 10.  I used the cd provided since I had no wired internet.  I'm sure some rigs don't have cd drives anymore so I'm sure you would have to download driver's and software from website.  Works great so far.  Played a few online games and no lagging.  Tested the download speed and getting better than my intel nuk with built in wireless in the same room same distance from wireless router.  I'm liking this so far. Looks well built.
5,I bought this to be able to use my Bluetooth wireless headset around the house. My previous range was horrible at about 1 foot using a USB plug in. Now I can go just about anywhere in my entire house listening to music and making conference calls - beautiful!!! Installation was good I found the manual to be well written. The hardest part was being gentle with the f-usb connection. I had the Intel driver wizard already installed so it detected the new hardware and I just had to click "install all." So nice... Well done TP Link! My network is connected via ethernet so I can't comment on the wifi capability.
5,I found this works quite well under Linux (Fedora 35) speeds were about the same as compared to wired bluetooth worked nicely as well.
5,I've had it for about a month now and it has been a joy to have.  I only had a 2.4 GHz card before and it had become very unreliable thanks to an increase in local wireless routers walking on each others' signals. The 5 GHz is great! With its shorter range I never have interference problems now.As an experiment I got a second TP-Link card for our other computer without the remove antenna. Hard to know how much location matters but this card consistently does about 20% better in speed testing.
5,Worked out of the box for me with Ubuntu 20.04.  No driver install needed.  Also I was worried about the usb port “requirement” but that is only for the bluetooth which I do not use.Im on the opposite side of the house of where the router is and was using an old edimax usb adapter I had.  I went from barely getting 1mb download speed to over 100mbps with this thing.  Sure happy about it and highly recommend it.My figures are 114mbps download and 10mbps upload.  Keep in mind that I am very far away from the router so others may get even better.
5,My son got his uncles computer as a hand me down and after beefing it up it would suffer from slow intermittent download speeds. Replaced the built-in card with this and voilà perfect internet.
5,Before I got this I was using Netgear’s powerline to run Ethernet to my pc and I was getting about 5MB/s download speeds (for reference my speeds were 20MB/s.) I installed this and it honestly took about 10 minutes to install and find the correct positions for the antennas. Did a speed test and am now getting 24MB/s. In steam I’m getting my full download speed and same in the blizzard launcher. Great product highly recommend.
5,My wife no longer wanted the old desktop computer that I built 10 years ago and bought a new laptop. But I didn't let go of this old work horse computer so I re-installed windows 10 and installed this wifi adapter. Now I can use it in the basement where there is no ethernet connection and can do everything on it that I did before but faster. I couldn't be happier knowing there is new life in the old desktop.
4,I needed to replace a cheaper TP-Link card that didn't survive a Windows 10 update (TP-Link didn't update the driver and there didn't appear to be any plans to do so).  As such I was more than a little hesitant to order another TP-Link product.  However I was desperately in need of a new WiFi card and this one had all of the features I was looking for.  Installation was easy and it works great!
5,Installation is standard for a card that has integrated Bluetooth your mother board has to have a pin usb port for the Bluetooth connection. I bought it for the Bluetooth. The motherboard I have came with a pci wifi/Bluetooth card. The Bluetooth signal on the card was very week and the hands free on my cell kept dropping. This wifi card is future proof on both techs and the Bluetooth signal is very strong zero issues with my phone now.
5,plug and play; unstall the old (another brand dysfunctional after several years use) card; plug this card in; you need to have a spare  internal USB connector to power bluetooth function. I like the antenna with magnetic base a lot. Power up the PC and then voila!  WiFi auto connected signal strong. Speed fast (see screen capture). Lastly I tested to pair bluetooth headphone with it; easy to do. Bluetooth headphone recognized and connected like a breeze.only question is longevity. Cannot tell now. If it last 3-year I will be quite happy.
5,On wireless AC (not AX) I'm getting a signal-to-noise ratio of 36dB (-56dB signal -92 dB noise) from one floor up and two walls over.My router lists my transmit / recieve rate at 173 mbit/s.All stats measured from the dd-wrt interface of a Netgear r6300v2.Update: putting the router in 80mhz multi-band mode I'm now getting 526m transmit rate and 650m rx rate with a signal of -61 and a noise floor of -92 dB (31dB SNR)Side note: the Bluetooth module needs a USB header on your motherboard. So give that a double check if you have a smaller board with minimal headers.
5,If you haven't upgraded to AX wifi. Do it. Now. With a proper router and wifi card you can get one gig over the air. I pay for 500 megs and guess what I get? The full 500 during downloads. This adapter is great. It looks clean. The antenna is magnetic. And it can give you full download strength over wifi. No more need for an ethernet cable. Just make sure you have a a wifi route to pair it with properly. Overall? A great upgrade
3,So I'm going to take it for granted that the adapter performs well that's been reviewed in-depth. What I am going to take to task is marketing and appearance.A lot of PC builds now are done not only with performance or capability in mind but also aesthetics. People want their builds to LOOK nice as well as function hence the proliferation of RGB custom water cooling etc.  One reason I chose this adapter was the nice red aluminum heat sink.I have just now realized that when mounted that heat sink will be on the BOTTOM of the card.For the life of me I can't figure out a couple of  things...1) Why do ALL of the vendors seem to display their adapter cards bottom up??? You can't see the company logo or whatever.2) Wouldn't that trap heat under the card?Anyway....3 stars for looks.
5,In the same room receives same speed as cable connected PC.  Works with Archer AX1800 wi-fi 6 router.My previous TP link USB adapter received only half a speed from router. You need to install it into pc pcie port + USB connector for power supply on your motherboard. I would recommend to check availability of these ports before purchasing this adapter.
5,is a decent wireless adapter.  Its a little faster than the USB version that I had before.  About 350mbps on the old NIC vs 480mbps on this one.  So definitely an improvement.  Keep in mind though that is just using an internet speed test on a 1gbps download service so I haven't actually tested it transferring to a local device which would likely be a little faster.The weird thing about this adapter is it requires a USB header on your motherboard for the Bluetooth function I'd think they would have found a way to pass both through the PCIe slot but that would probably make it an x2 device instead of x1.
5,Tried installing it without connecting the USB cable portion. That did not work for me once I swapped position with graphics card to allow for USB connection it worked right away.I am getting great speeds of 600 download and 450 upload (I am pretty sure its my modem and router now holding me back). I have not had any issue with my connection cutting in and out.I am very happy with my purchase.
4,Being forced to use the X1 slot is less than ideal in my case with the card right up against the GPU fan. To be fair the instructions do specify the X1 but the PCI standard is supposed to work with single lane peripherals in higher lane slots.Anyway I'm getting a good signal and good speed. Everything is fine.
5,Works perfect right out of the box! Installing was super easy. Only took about 10-15 mins. Didn't even need to install drivers from the CD. My computer automatically installed the drivers got connected and starting working right away! Getting similar performance to a wired connection I was using before. I do not own a router in my apartment (everyone uses the shared WiFi) so I can only have one thing plugged into the wall at a time.
4,It's extremely important to download/install the latest drivers. That and if your computer has built-in Bluetooth or Wi-Fi transceivers be sure to disable them in Device Manager first before judging the performance of the card; we chased our tails trying to figure out why Bluetooth range wasn't improved after installing the card and found--after contacting Tech Support--that we had neglected to disable the computer's built-in transceivers. D'oh! After we did that the card's Bluetooth transceiver took over and we definitely noticed a range improvement (Bluetooth v5.x.)
5,Good solution for adding WiFi and Bluetooth to your PC. Reasonably good length wires so you can get the antennae on your desk if your PC is on the floor. Good 5G and 2.4G performance. Good range. Bluetooth works great.All you need is an empty PCIe slot. it will work on any PCIe slot X1 X4 or X8.Make sure you plug the Bluetooth cable into a USB header on your motherboard.
4,Pair nicely with my Orbi Pro wifi 6.
4,Increased wifi signal after going though 1/2 dozen other solutions. Finally satisfied.
5,Highly recommended!The download speed of my computer with its original wireless card was around 200 Mbps now it has been nearly doubled.The only thing to notice is that if you do want the Bluetooth feature double check if there's a f_usb connector available on the motherboard otherwise you won't get Bluetooth from this card. If you don't care about it like me just leave it unconnected which doesn't affect the WiFi.Also this card will work in PCIe x4 slot despite it asking for a PCIe x1 slot.
4,The wifi strength is pretty great I got over 200 MB’s the only issue I have is that the Bluetooth connection drops randomly for seemingly no reason. When it does work it has a great distance but often times it will simply lose connection to my Bluetooth devices.
5,I have an ASRock Z490 PG Velocita motherboard and this TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000 PCIe WiFi Card is replacing a TP-Link Archer T4E card.  I have Orbi mesh wifi 6.  My download speed doubled from a 200-250 Mbps to 500-550 Mbps.  Installation on Windows 10 was easy.  I did download the driver to my desktop but Windows automatically installed one.  I benchmarked them both and the driver that Windows installed was better.
5,This may say Windows 10 only but it's running an Intel AX200 chipset which is supported by the newest Linux kernels. Plugs right in and works on Ubuntu 20.04 no setup whatsoever. Just boop wifi and Bluetooth menu are there now. Haven't given it a hard local test yet but ran a speed test on my 300mbps internet connection and got 350 through it so it's not having any obvious issues.
5,Arrived faster than stated and works great. Only thing i wish was made more clear on the page is without plugging in an internal usb cord you lose bluetooth functionality. I had an open port so no harm no fail but i didnt notice this before purchasing. Antenna cable length and magnet base are great. I only needed it for a couple of weeks but it did its job 300+mbps on the far side of the house with 12-20ms latency. Now i have a reliable back up. Gaming on it was just fine
5,Great WiFi reception and also better bluetooth reception for my Logitech bluetooth mouse that was dropping its connection when I tried using a smaller USB bluetooth fob.Even though it only needs a PCIe 1X slot it does work in the last remaining PCIe 16X slot I had on my PC motherboard.  Installation was straightforward but had to worm around in my PC tower to plug in the bluetooth cable into one of the open USB pin-out sections.
5,Much need updated for my son's gaming PC that didn't come with a wifi card. Installed this card easily good thing I had an extra slot. The cable reached the card to the USB connector on the motherboard. I like how the mount that holds the antenna is magnetic so it just sits on top of my son's PC and doesn't move. He's getting around 350 Mbps using speed test connected to Orbi non wifi 6 satellite. Now curious to see how fast it would be if I upgraded my mesh system.
5,Needed a solution for wifi for my PC. This worked perfectly. Easy installation. Quick setup. Up and running at full speed in minutes.
5,Normally I like to hard wire my ethernet connection but I had to move my newly built PC to another room. My wife got to keep the den/office and I'm in another room without wiring to the router. And my new PC did not have built in Wifi on the motherboard. It was easy to install and the connection works great for what I need it to do. I have not tried any online gaming so I cannot comment on that but for everyday need to connect to the internet to get stuff done this wifi card works great.
4,Just a heads up. . . My motherboard only has a USB 3.0 port on it so I have had to order a 9 pin (USB 2.0) to 20 pin (USB 3.0) adapter.  Here's a link to the adapter I ordered.https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LDFWLJY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Other than this little hiccup installation was easy and it works fine.
5,I live in a 2 story townhouse.  My wireless network is coming from a single 802.11 AC dual band router and while it's great on the first floor the signal isn't that fantastic upstairs.  The room I'm using this AX adapter in is on the second floor and entirely across the townhouse.  It's about as far away as it can be and though the signal's pretty weak I more than doubled my available data throughput over an 802.11 AC WiFi card despite trying several higher gain style antennas.
5,This was super easy to install in Windows 10 and has great Wifi reception. It only took about 10 minutes to install and I didn't have any driver issues. The antenna can be mounted to the remote platform or to the card directly. It also has Bluetooth included so you really do get a lot for the price. Just be sure that you have an open USB 2.0 header available on your motherboard it's required. This is the second or third network related item I've purchased from TP-link and so far I'm pretty happy with their stuff.
5,Thing works great! Got speeds 15x faster than my original wifi adapter. Only is I've had is with the Bluetooth. Idk if there's a compatibility problem with the computer. I just can't seem to get it to work.
5,Gets very good wifi from across the house from my router. I didn't need to download anything my pc just started using it with wifi it also comes with Bluetooth which is nice as sometimes I like to use a controller and don't like using up my USB ports. This does use a USB header for the Bluetooth but I had an extra on my motherboard so it worked perfectly.
5,I have been through some poor Wi-Fi controllers in the past. Legacy cards with no drivers no Bluetooth or just plane not enough lanes over the signal. The only thing I could imagine ever coming better than what this card comes with is maybe better Bluetooth for future devices. With the ax WiFi technology you can establish a perfect connection with your router to maintain maximum bandwidth. I was mainly getting this for just the traffic on my home network but have actually noticed a clear boost in my maximum data transfer rate even over a DSL connection.
5,I had been using a USB dongle for a long time and never realized how bad it was until I installed this.The adapter was pretty painless to install and took me about 5 minutes. Solid signal strength permanently and a big increase in my speeds.
5,Tech support isn't great but this unit came fast packed nice and organized. It's a pretty straight forward installation with a nice external thick dual antennas. I don't have an ax router to test it's truest potential but there are two others in house with me totalling 3 they game and stream day in day out and watch Netflix/amazon. I'm about 75ft in a separate building with a height differential of approx 15ft and I get 4bars and very often fluctuates to 5 bars with great speed on the 2.4ghz. 5ghz channel tho.. I get 0 barslol
5,Had some doubts reading reviews but since I custom built my PC I knew that I had a spare usb internal port on my motherboard. I didn't expect the CD based driver install requirement (who still owns a cd drive). Just plugged in an  ethernet cable to download the drivers off the website and boom was in business. Wish I pulled the trigger on this sooner. Another very neat feature is the magnet the rabbit ear base comes with has some serious strength. Fun placements on my NZXT case.
5,Easy install and setup. I pre-loaded the drivers installed the card and I was online. Moved the router to the first floor and this is the speed I get on my desktop for WiFi. Blazing fast as if I was hard wired couldn’t be happier.If anything changes I’ll update but so far on day one I’m extremely happy.
5,The WiFi/BT signal blew away another adapter I bought on Amazon and returned. I actually ended up returning this as well as I bought a new MB with WiFi (ASUS TUF Gaming X570-Plus) and while the range decent the range on this card was noticably better than my new MB. I didn't need all the range this card provided.It also has a strong magnet on the bottom of the antenna that worked great for keeping it connected. Highly recommend this if you need a wifi/bluetooth adapter.
5,Big antenna base and antennas. Great reception and speeds. I am on 600Mbps cable internet and get up to 740Mbps at my 8 port switch. This card took me from getting a max of 390Mbps to an midrange of 620Mbps. It has spiked to 714 and down to 559 but likes the 620s. I did use the included disk for setup and drivers. I'm impressed and recomend this product. I liked so much I bought another one for my work desk PC.
5,Fantastic WiFi card. The extended base isn't needed but it may help. This card served me very well til I got my new pre-built PC that already has a top tier Wi-Fi PCIe card. I highly recommend this product. The card's construction is very solid the red heat sink is a nice touch and does aid with heat dissipation.
5,I had previously used a $20 2.4GHZ wifi card from tp link and it only got a max of 21 mbps download and 1mbps upload and after I installed this it now gets 71 mbps upload and 10 mbps upload on 2.4GHZ  and a max of 222 mbps and a max of 11 mbps upload from halfway my room (router is in living room) and is also faster than ethernet which gets a max of 180 mbps download and 9 mbps upload.
5,I never write reviews on here but I felt Inclined to share how amazing this WiFi card really is. 5 minute install and I’m finally getting amazing speed on my gig speed internet. Prior to this card I had a USB WiFi card. My computer area in my house is not direct connection capable in relation to my router placement so i bit the bullet and bought this. WOW. I’m blown away! (Keep in mind I’m over 60 feet and behind 2 walls from my router) and was still able to pull well over 600 mbps down. I’m impressed.
5,Receives well even on the other side of the house.  4 bars at all times.  Throughput is excellent.  I had some issues with reception and the data throughput to my wireless router with my built Wi-Fi.  This fixed them all.  Installation was a snap.  I just put the card in and Windows 10 took care of everything automatically.  One thing you might want to do is disable your existing built in Wi-Fi in the BIOS so there are not two devices to choose from when you connect.  It's not required but it might prevent confusion.
5,I was using a WiFi repeater with an ethernet cable for internet before this card. I don't have a disc drive on my build so I downloaded the drivers ahead of time. The card was super easy to install and setup. Once everything was in place including the magnetic attachment I installed the drivers and was able to connect via WiFi. The speeds are great and I notice no hiccups why doing school watching videos or playing games unlike the reapeter.
3,Wifi portion works just fine but Bluetooth doesn't but probably because of my PC build or older drivers for previous Bluetooth adapters could be causing the issue funny enough if I installed the driver it worked then next time I boot I uninstalled it worked and repeat really weird but like I said it not working could completely be because of my set up wifi is amazing though
5,I bought this in FEB 2021 because of internal Ethernet card was only getting 95 MBS. I have cable with speed boost and should be way higher. I purchased this internal PC card and external antenna and average 350 MBS. Works well only one thing it disabled my blue tooth feature on my PC but I don't use that so beware of that issue.
5,The reason I purchased this was because the WiFi chip on my motherboard just wasn't cutting it. My router signal couldn't reach my office but thanks to the antenna and increased speed the problem is solved if you need a stronger network card I recommend this one. Best 40 bucks Ive ever spent
5,Most new motherboards come with this built in but after I switched back to the good ole 4790k on a aged motherboard I still had to have the bluetooth that would support the newest xbox controller. This works perfectly for that and my bluetooth headphones. Excellent range too I can walk outside and still jam to my music.
5,Installed this in my Asus motherboard and screwed on the antenna base. Windows X found it installed the drivers in a couple seconds and I connected it to the 5Ghz channel of my Asus XT8 router. Flawless connection pulling max speeds. Installation couldn't be easier or faster. Little pricy but it works and I'm happy to spend a little more for quality
5,Excellent signal coverage. I was having a Wi-Fi to ethernet device previously. Signal reception was very bad with that device and bandwidth was very less. Now after using this AX3000E device Signal coverage is very good and I am getting a very good bandwidth. This is very much helpful especially during working from home. Device installation is also very easy just I need to snap at to the existing PCIe port.
5,*PROS*:- Worked out of the box on Windows 10 (64 bit ver. 1909) and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS- Wifi 2.4GHz and 5 GHz are working like a charm (my router is not Wifi 6)- Antenna looks sleek and feels sturdy (weighted support with anti-slip pad)*CONS*:- BlueTooth didn't work great (my appt. complex has too much bluetooth noise I was hoping this would help seems it can't do magic)- Need internal USB 2.0 port on motherboard (not an issue for me)- Drivers are on a CD?! (not necessary Windows 10 comes with good drivers out of the box)
5,Its super easy to plug in and it can reach my wifi signal from my garage which my last wifi card couldnt. It's amazing I bought another for my other PC as well.
5,Worked on first install and was as fast as we needed. Just make sure your motherboard has an extra PCIe slot to fit the card and you have somewhere open to put the antennae and you’re good to go.
5,Works perfectly magnet lets me stick it to the pc case for easy install
5,I built my first computer with this as part of my build. I got Garuda Linux running and this was picked up by the OS without having to install any drivers. It holds a stable connection as well I'm a gamer so I really notice when a disconnect occurs.
5,I would recommended trying to use this without the Intel/TP-link driver. For whatever reason after I installed the driver which I normally always do I kept losing connection. There were frequent random drops that were so frustrating.Did a clean install of Windows and just let the Device Manager pick it up and everything has been flawless since then.Other people may have had different experiences but this was mine.
3,I purchased 2 of these in hopes of speeding up my connection on 2 desktops but I was wrong. I score these a 3 for a few of reasons 1st they didnt increase my connection speed any better not worse but not better then all the other adaptors I have tried.  2cd they are much more complex to install vs a simple usb dongle which makes them no better in quality but more complicated to use.  3rd they are nearly double the price of a USB dongle counter part but provide about the same level of connection.The pros though which I havent tested is that with the larger antenna the range is likely better then a smaller USB dongle.  They also add bluetooth functionality the cheaper counterparts might not have.If you are looking for a simple to install decent wifi connection and are not computer savy enough to install hardware or search for drivers I would recommend you look at cheaper USB dongles that are much simpler to use.
5,Great wifi card does its job haven't lost any connection yet strong signal fast internet.
5,Used to connect my home PC to the network. Powerful signal strength. Magnetic base let's me stick the antenna to my case. Bluetooth feature enables countless connections! You can't beat this product at its price point!
5,My computer is against a wall and the existing Wi-Fi card didn’t get great reception so having the antenna on a cable that you can place somewhere else tripled my download speed with steam at least. From about 9 MB per second to about 30. Really impressed with this.
4,Connection was not stable at first shows connected but no signal. Checked my WiFi with other device and made sure it wasn’t my WiFi’s proem. later hasn’t seen the same problem. Will need more time to test.I think it might be cussed by the driver because at the time of unstable connection the system started up weirdly too never took so long for my PC to start before installing the card.
5,I was getting 110mbps max with my usb wifi adapter...installed this and I'm up to about 280mbps. So more than double the speed.Would have preferred if the package had included a screw for securing the pci-card to the computer case (my case didn't have any extra screws I could use) but that's really a minor complaint.Will update if I have any issues but for now I'm quite satisfied.
5,The produce did exactly what it should do.  It improved my internet speed by a factor of 4x.  Because of the location of my desktop it was is a weak signal area.  The external antenna resolved this problem and not my speeds are more than I could hope for.  Great product easy to install plug and play.  Recommend.
5,Popped it in installed drivers and was connected to WiFi in about 5 minutes.Very impressed with the antenna it uses a magnet to attach to the case and it's quite strong so I can't see it being knocked over by accident.Signal is decent I get 4bars on 5g connection from about 50 feet away through 2 bathrooms in between. I actually get a better signal than my cell does.Haven't had a chance to play with the Bluetooth yet but I'm looking forward to it.
5,I know it is pricey.I paid $40 when it was on the sale though.The card's physical quality is very good.Don't forget to install your Antennas and place them in right place.It is VERY important.I don't know why this one is better than other ones they all use intel chips.. hm..
5,Works wonders to receive a signal through a wall with AC ducts and mains wiring. Maintains bluetooth connection through several rooms in the house. Easy install and plenty of antenna wire.Software CD is required for windows 10 but after that it works perfectly through any updated by being independent of any software.Great high throughput solution for wi-fi and de-clutter with bluetooth for minimalists and people struggling with USB ports.
5,I wanted to add Blue Tooth capability to my ThinkCentre Desktop.This product design maximizes the flexibility of the placement and adjustment of the antennas. The antennas are sturdier than most I've used and less susceptible to accidental damage. The installation was painless in terms of both the physical device as well as the required software.I did purchase a separate USB power cable due to the proprietary nature of Lenovo's 11 pin USB header versus the standard 9 pin.
4,Great upgrade for any higher end PCs or just to increase signal strength. The magnetic base is really strong so you don’t have to worry about it falling off after you set it up.  Overall I get about a 20-25 percent better signal with thisNote:If your current wireless card is integrated into your motherboard make sure to disable before installing this one or your PC may not boot correctly.
5,This product is easy to install and I get great signal from across the house. I would def recommend to anyone who is debating between a wifi card and this item that this product works just as great!
5,Easy installation; took less than 10 minutes to physically install the wifi card and download the drivers. My PC and router are at opposite end of the house but I always get a good signal. I personally opted to magnetically mount the antenna on top of my PC tower but you can keep it hidden behind the tower if you prefer.
5,Very easy install. Bluetooth works great. Using it on an Ubuntu 20.04 system which acts as a print server and media server. No configuration needed. Have not had any issues with dropped signal and it stays strong although my access point is only a few feet from it.
5,This is much better than the usb plug in type wifi adapters. Great signal strength and can be conveniently placed where you need it. The base is a very strong magnet mount so you should be very careful where you place it or even where you handle it. Hard drives flash cards SD cards could suffer from the strong magnetism.
5,Getting 650 to 680 mbps consistently out of my gigabit data package wirelessly 950 mbps wired on my gaming PC. My system came with a wireless N card getting 40 mbps. By comparison my 2013 27” iMac with a wireless 5/ac card is getting 680 mbps as well. I’m wondering how a wireless 6 card like this would perform on a Mac.
5,I upgrade to this card from the febsmart  FS-AE 120 and oh my god what an improvement on the 5gz. With my old wireless card I couldn't even get past 140Mpbs on 5ghz.I am on the 600Mpbs comcast extreme plan and now I am getting 500Mpbs every single time when doing speed test.not using the tplink software using the Intel intel wifi 6 ax200 160 mhz drivers.I am gradually going to upgrade all my desktops to this wireless card in the future.
5,I recently upgraded to a new Eero WiFi 6 router and despite a solid signal my desktop was getting ~1 mbs download.Adding this to my desktop was easy but it is worth mentioning it was a home built pc. Once I installed it into PCI slot and booted my computer immediately recognized and began using it to connect to the internet. My connection jumped up to ~80 mbs.
5,It only took a few minutes to install open the case and put the board in the proper slot close the case and attach the antenna.  Software setup was quick and easy.  It connected easily and flawlessly to may Netgear RAX70 Wifi 6 router and my through put is great 900+Mbps.  Highly recommend this product if you have a wifi 6 router
5,Plug and play on Ubuntu 20.10 and been using for weeks with no drop off. Bluetooth plugged into my MSI motherboard and works well headphones reach two rooms away now. I had a USB adapter before that would cut out just 10' away.I don't have a WiFi 6 router yet but ready for the next few years now.
4,I am in the unfortunate situation where I do not want to drill and the distance is incredibly short between my source and receiver. I bought this to test speeds and I am quite happy. Although I do not get my advertised 1.0 Gbps internet speeds I do get 500 mbps for day to day use which is more than adequate.
5,This is a very inexpensive way to get the most out of gigabit internet plans for your PC. Before WiFi 6(802.11ax) you essentially needed to drill holes and route cables to get excellent internet speeds. With this adapter and a compatible router WiFi speeds above 500Mbps are now easy to achieve. I'm delighted with the product and I'm no longer regretting having gigabit internet and not being wired.The only downside is that Bluetooth requires a vacant USB header on your motherboard WiFi will work without it though just plan ahead if you need Bluetooth as well.
5,It’s fantastic and the external antenna is well built and magnetic. I’m getting full bars upstairs from the router with 600+ mbps on a gigabit network consistently downloading games at 60+ MB/s.Bluetooth is a little finicky but I think it has to do with me using a USB header splitter as my mobo only has 1 USB header. When I connect to my headphones it works fine but when I connect to my sound system it lags. Easy fix run wired audio.
5,I bought this to replace a usb WiFi adapter that needed to be reset too often. I run Windows 10.  It was easy to install and setup. Since installing my internet access has been outstanding and without any problems. 100% satisfied. Only wonder why I waited so long to replace my old adapter.
4,website is not helpful.i ran into multiple problems trying to get my PC to recognize this device had to do research elsewhere to figure out a fix and then ended up figuring it out on my own. huge headache but it works
5,This is a nice looking wireless adapter it will surely help remove and bottle necks you might have in your network. Tbh in most cases this thing is probably faster that some routers can transmit 🤣.. it maintains solid connection and ive used it constantly for over 6 months and never once had a problem with it dropping connection.
5,I bought this and it was very easy to install. I play Call of Duty and other games over the internet as well as streaming music and movies with no issues at all. The addition of Bluetooth was a nice tough as well. No issues with this would recommend without hesitation.
5,Installation was fairly straight forward. Speed went up by 100Mbps. I was at 147 Mbps and after I installed this it's at 252 Mbps. Seems to be built well. I've only had it for a day or two so only time will tell how well it holds up. For now I'm very happy with my purchase.
4,Solid signal. Great for gaming. Very long signal range. No issues to date.
1,The initial setup involved recovering from several unexpected BSODs due to some driver incompatibility. Once that was resolved by removing all the TP-Link network drivers and allowing Windows to install its own I have had regular issues with the WiFi portion of the device becoming stale during use particularly after waking from sleep. I have had to troubleshoot extensively including the Windows troubleshooter tool disable/enable the device in Device Manager etc. Device Manager has reported two errors with some regularity for this device: Code 10 (This device cannot start) and Code 43 (Windows has stopped this device because it reported problems).Troubleshooting the issues has taken 30-60 minutes each day of use which is really unacceptable particular when reliable connection is required for work-related video-conferencing and/or PC Gaming. When the device does work it shows slower speeds than what I am able to get on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (see attached images).I have not had any issues with the Bluetooth portion (connected using a mouse and a headset) even when the WiFi device is disabled. I was disappointed to find out after I received the device that an open USB 2.0 header is required on the motherboard to use the Bluetooth capability. This doesn't make much sense in my case because I only have two headers and one is used for my AIO CPU cooler. The other was being used for two open USB 2.0 ports on my case. If I used one of those open ports on the case for a BT dongle I would still have another open port. Interestingly the connection from the TP-Link device only uses 4 pins of the available 9.Bottom line I am contacting TP-Link tech support for any guidance they can provide but am eyeing a return for this device.
5,I am a tech and I upgraded my router to an Asus RT-AX88U AX6000.  My new PC build used the old TP-Link AC1300 PCIe Wireless Card.  This product did not work well with my router and speeds where low.  I upgraded to this card and my speeds increased dramatically over 1.5 - 2GB!.  This card is the way to go for this new tech.  Easy to install and just update the included drivers then add to your network and that's it.  This is a must have for any new build.
5,I love everything about this. It’s was extremely easy to install and once installed it connected immediately to the WiFi and Bluetooth no drivers needed. I’m really happy with this. I didn’t think it was pricey because you get what you pay for. If I wanted a headache I’d spend less. If I want ease and simplicity you get this...
1,TLDR; This is junk don't waste your time like I did.I am an IT professional with 20 years experience and I had high hopes for this card. It has been given good reviews on multiple websites.  So as soon as it arrived my PC was torn open and waiting.  First of all. I did not hook up with the USB jumper cable from the card to the USB motherboard header because I didn't really want Bluetooth. I have no use for it.  The card couldn't find a network while I was sitting 10 ft from an access point. So I thought that maybe the Bluetooth hookup and drivers must be mandatory so I tore the PC apart again and hooked up the jumper wire re-installed the drivers and I connect for about 10 seconds. After several attempts I went to another computer and downloaded the latest drivers......Fingers crossed I uninstalled the old drivers rebooted and re-installed the new drivers and rebooted. I connected for about 25 seconds and then it wouldn't see any networks again. I rebooted and connected for about 20 seconds and then it dropped connection and again wouldn't see any wireless networks.....I had two laptops sitting next to the PC that could connect to my AP fine (like I said it was about 10 ft away).I did some troubleshooting and found that it was getting proper addressing from the DHCP server. I could connect to my gateway but could not ping anything else on my internal network.  I also could not get out to the Internet.  Trying to troubleshoot for 25-30 seconds at a time in between reboots became frustrating so I just decided to pack it back up and ask for a refund.
5,After having constant drops in my power line Ethernet I decided to go the WiFi route with a card. I chose this one as it has a long antenna so it must be powerful. This thing is amazing. My download speed has never been higher and the bluetooth function on it allows me to wear my airpods anywhere in my house with absolutely no delay. This thing is a beast highly highly recommend.
5,This card works great. I love that the antenna base plate is magnetic. It seems like it will stay in place really well. The speeds are more than adequate. I am using on an AC Wi-Fi network as I haven't updated my access points to AX. I hope this brings years of usability for my son's PC. Only con is the Bluetooth requires an additional cord to an available USB header on your motherboard not all will have an extra to attach it.
5,Ill keep this short and sweet. Heres some instructions and thoughts.1. I downloaded the drivers for this and installed them.2. Powered off my PC and installed the device completely.3. Turned on pc and connected to wifi no problem.Ive included before and after pics of speeds.First impressions are great. Zero issues. Will update ad time goes on.
4,Bluetooth not on all the time.
5,Great signal strength with antennae in base or in back of card.  Installation is a little weird since you need to connect the card to a USB pin set on the motherboard but the signal strength is great.  Works well even for online gaming.  I'm averaging 300Mbps.
5,I bought this to replace a very weak USB dongle on my home workstation.  Plugged in the board and powered up my computer.  No problem working off the shelf with Linux Mint and I assume it will also be plug and play with windows.  Very happy so far.  Bluetooth connected to my devices relatively quickly but I don't have everything configured to know how well it actually works.  Definitely would recommend to others.
4,The installation process was so easy and the signal reception is fantastic. I just got a problem with the Bluetooth connector because my PC doesn't have 9 pin internal USB connector I thought it would work with its pcie connection.
5,So far great addition to a wifi 6 network to get fast speeds and reliable connections. Very good design with adjustability for antenna placement. If you were upgrading to a non integrated wifi connection this one is a perfect choice keeping the antennas above or out from behind the computer this is a great option for more reliable speeds and signal strength.
4,Overall very huge upgrade from my usb wifi adapter (longer range faster speeds etc.) However this does sometimes just drop internet and requires you to disable then enable the card. It gets annoying but is still a very good card. I would suggest pairing it with a router that is also ax though my ac capable router seems to work just fine with it.
5,Unboxed plugged-in to PCI slot on motherboard. I couldn't find usb power source on motherboard to plug in bluetooth cable but I don't mind bluetooth being not present in the pc. Installed driver from supplied DVD and restarted. Under device manager WiFi was already present ! Searched for my network and that's it ! Took about 10 min.
5,I had a wifi dongle that worked but was a little iffy especially if I had it in a port in the back of the computer. I bought one of these for my computer. My mom's computer was having a bad connection to her speakers so I bought a second one so I could put bluetooth speakers on her computer and eliminate the buzz. Both units working great.
5,I installed it easily in a minute. I had a massively inconvenient 12 inch long antenna attached to my old card. Compared with my old one this one is the perfect length which allows it more versatility. It performs consistently reliably and quickly and as a bonus it is bifurcated! No complaints so far. I'm a satisfied customer.
5,I thought $50 was a lot for a wifi card but I am getting 200 mbps+ with this thing.  That is enough for me to play video games with.  It was easy to install - it fit easily into my computer and I had enough room for it.  The bluetooth also works and I plugged in some speakers and a controller and they have both functioned as I would want them to.
5,I was using a Netgear A6210 USB 3.0 adapter for a bit but it just wasn't giving me the speeds for what I was doing but does work well.This TP-Link Wifi 6 gives me LAN speeds its awesome. Gaming with it has been awesome no drops no connection issues. It just works. Adding Bluetooth is a bonus tho I have not installed the drivers for that yet.
5,My home office is in the back of the house (opposite end to the modem/router). Generally signal is weaker than the rest of the house here. This PCIe card gave me the fastest wifi possible to my computer and gave me a very fast internet speed too (also due to my Gigabit service and router type). Easy to install and the magnetic mount for the antennas are very strong. Super happy with the results.
5,My old desktop had an old network card that was yielding me a FAST.COM speed of 46 despite the fact that I have a very fast ISP speed from Cox. After about 10-15 minutes worth of installation effort my new TP-Link AX 3000 yielded me a FAST.COM speed of 550. A further test on Cox Network Speed Test after installation went from a download of 51.1mbps to 454.4 mbps. This makes me feel as though it was money well-spent. I am happy!
5,I was using some other USB 3.0 Wifi adaptors that did help but periodically my Wifi signal would drop throwing me out of one my Online meetings. Updated my PC with this bad boy and I easily get 500mbs now with Comcast. As long as you know how to install the card you shouldn't have any problems get up and running.
5,I have tried SEVERAL USB wifi dongles with assorted sizes antennas technologies etc.  I would get about half of my normal network speeds at best and packet loss when gaming or working remotely.  This thing gives me 99.9% wired network speed along with bluetooth coverage over my entire house on 3 levels.  And no more packet loss!  I paid about $40 for this crazy looking external USB 3.0 wifi thing that is a TOTAL waste of money.  Wish I had tried this sooner.
5,My previous wi-fi card could only deliver less than 1mbps.  This card without any other changes got me over 7 mbps of download speed.
5,I got this thing before I had a wifi6 router because I was tired of the super slow usb adapter I was using. It worked really well (I was seeing 15mb/s).But when I got a wifi6 router holy hell. 80-100mb/s. This thing is faster than my wired network...
5,Added this to my older PC wifi speed boosted from 300Mbps to 900Mbps on my xfinity 1G plan exhausting every last bit of the data.To clarify you need high speed wifi-6 router and high speed modem too. I used Netgear RAX120 for instance.You don't need this on newer platforms with Wifi6 built-in already e.g. many Z490 chipset motherboards already have wifi6 built-in which is equally fast without occupying PCI-e bus.
5,Perfectly designed and joined a Wifi network from TP-Link AX1800 Router on the other side of the house!Throughput of Wifi-6 capability is real and it is quick and reliable.  Good product and reasonable price.
5,This was easy to install the drivers were installed pretty quickly from an ethernet connection since I don't have a disc drive and the base is magnetic so it sticks to my case. It works great and I'm getting as good of speed as an ethernet cable would be for the speed of internet I have available at my house.
5,Super easy to install if you built your own PC. First photo was wired internet speeds. Second photo is wireless speeds in the same area as the router (Verizon’s newest router with WiFi 6 and 8502.11ax). Third picture is in my room which is two rooms from the router. I would say overall happy but I literally just got it today 09/16/2020. Hope this review helps.
3,I got a TP Link Deco W3600 Wifi 6 router and thought I'd rock with this wireless card to pair with it and get the most out of my 500 mbps fiber internet. The internet point is downstairs with one Deco unit and my PC is upstairs in the last room with the other Deco unit - they're in the extreme opposites of the house.In reality though I got exactly the same speed I was getting previously with my Netgear USB wireless card (which is Wifi 5) at 160 mbps.Plugging my PC via ethernet to the Deco got me the speeds I was expecting (400 mbps down 500 mbps up) so this PCI-E card performance was totally underwhelming.
5,With the external antennas WPA3  and 11.ax I have the expected improvements of throughput improved latency  and security.  I do suggest prior to installing that all drivers are downloaded and use the 'Intel Driver & Support Assistant'.  This should help make the install a breeze by ensuring you already have the most current drivers.
5,Works quite well.  Installation was easy enough.  Make sure your PC has a spare internal USB port before ordering.  I had to purchase a USB port extension card before I could use this as all my USB ports were already in use.
5,Saludos.Compre un PC de escritorio y necesitaba una buena señal de WIFI y Bluetooth así que compre este dispositivo TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000 PCIe Tarjeta WiFi (Archer TX3000E) hasta 2400Mbps Bluetooth 5.0 802.11AX Ad.Gracias
4,This is a good wifi card although I question the logic of putting strong magnets into the base of the external wifi antenna. You can remove them if you peel back the rubber on the base.
5,This intel chipset works on linux with kernel 5.1 or newer. Latest debian should have the modules available to install.
2,I have gone through two of these cards and they are super fast. I get my full network speed out of the card which is over 320mbps. These cards just don't last in my PC for whatever reason. The first card I got lasted about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks. I had left my pc on overnight and when I got up in the morning I woke up to the computer locked up in a black screen. I rebooted the computer to find the card was no longer detected. Tried moving the card to my other 3 PCIe slots on the motherboard and nothing. I RMA'd the card and installed the new one that came out which worked wonderfully. Twelve days later I was connecting to discord and the computer made the device disconecting sound and the display died. After restarting I found I no longer had the Wifi device in my device manager and the card had failed in the same manner as the first.These cards are REALLY fast but have terrible longevity in my experience. Seeing as both of the units I had failed in under a month I feel I wasted money on the purchase.
5,Great items. It upgrades my speed 3-4x times faster than my last adapter (60 mbps to 240 mbps). The bluetooth is good. I used it for headset and doesnt have a problem at all. Can already use without driver installed.
5,Easy to install (as long as you have a free pci x 1 port).  Easy to setup...just turned the computer back on and it was installed (with the latest version of windows).  I've got 200mbps internet so I tested this thing...and got over 210mbps download speed!  This thing is awesome.
5,Easy to install. Works flawlessly and increased my speeds by a factor of 10. Has not crashed at all after weeks of intense and demanding use.Simple set up-I learned from other posts - this card requires 2 drivers. One for WiFi and one for BT. Only download and install one driver at a time and you should have no issues.
5,While the wifi is great (it went from 260/210 to 550/511) Bluetooth did not work at all on Windows 10 even after rebooting a few times and reinstalling the Bluetooth driver. My husband has the same card and Bluetooth is working correctly on his Windows 10 machine.EDIT - got a replacement and the Bluetooth is now working fine. Must have been a lemon.
5,Connected it to my mother board and turned on PC.  After a brief auto update by Windows 10 it works flawlessly.  II did not install software included in box or on website.  Speeds are similar to my Ethernet wired PC at 75Mbps or more.  My PING is less than 30ms with this WiFi card also similar to my wired PC.
5,This card works great on Linux no additional drivers needed. Not sure why Amazon and several other retailers list this card as Windows 10 only.If you poke around other retailers list a requirement Linux kernel version > 5.1 I'm on 5.6 and can say both the wireless and bluetooth features work flawlessly. Easily hitting 600 mbps on 5 ghz wireless AC with the router on a different floor. This card is fantastic.
3,I gained about 100mb/s increase in speed but the card introduced other issues. About every 10 minutes or so it would lose connection with the wifi router.  This would last from 10 to 45 seconds or so. I disconnected the USB cable (for Bluetooth) from my motherboard and the now it loses wifi connection about once an hour or so. Interestingly when I first installed the drivers all it did was update existing Intel wifi and Bluetooth drivers that were already installed for the mobo's built-in wifi/Bluetooth hardware (ASRock Taichi X470). Bottom line for me not worth the money considering the minor bump in download speed and the inconvenience of dropping the wifi connection to the router.
5,Install -  Easy to Install. Popped in within a few minutes.Speed -  Wireless speeds using 5g wireless connection are 700mbps+.Blu Tooth - I am not currently using Blu tooth set up so I cannot speak to the sound quality issues other reviews are  mentioning.Drivers -  Didn't even take the CD out of the box.OS -  Running Windows 10
5,Yup! This is far the best solution for your home PC if you don't want to have ugly wires laying around the house. WiFi speed and ping are great. Truly reliable solution.
3,Initial WiFi speeds were slow using the automatic Windows drivers but I pulled recommended drivers from the TP-Link support site and speeds increased to nearly match my wired connection.  As I do have a wired option right now I primarily purchased this for it's Bluetooth capabilities in the near term and this is where the card faltered.  My Xbox controller would randomly stop responding in games until I shifted focus to a different app at which point it would resume normal operations.  Same with a PS4 pad.  The controller wasn't disconnecting... the card just seemed seemed to stop processing commands until I hopped back to the desktop.  Preliminary troubleshooting wasn't turning up any obvious reasons for this so I returned the card.
5,I ordered this product updating from an older ac single antenna model. Due to apartment living and plenty of wireless devices all around and the AC duct between me and the router 5.0GHz had a terrible connection and 2.5GHz was crowded without providing full speeds.With a more powerful MIMO supporting networking card (the existing router already supported MIMO) I have a much greater connection and full utilization of bandwidth.Will buy again.
5,Bought it for my son. His wifi card went out. Bought this and easy to install. Works great
5,Was having a lot of issues with a usb adapter and finally got fed up with running tech support constantly to get okay speeds. Got this unit install was simple and I was connectly within a few seconds. 2.4ghz and 5ghz are always full signal. 2.4ghz i get 45mbps and on 5ghz i max out my isp plan at 115mbps. Latency went from 15-20 down to 5-10. Distance between the c7000v2 router/modem and the antennae is around 45feet through 3 walls.
5,I got a $15 network card when I built my pc. I consistently got 35 mb/s download speed even though my service is for 600 mb/s. After installing (pretty easy just search for AX3000 drivers and you'll find them) my download speed is now 485 mb/s. I'm a floor above my router so it's very nice to have fast internet without having to buy a 200+ ft ethernet cable
5,The card was super easy to install. My computer did need any configuration to get it working. The wifi signal is steady and strong. Nothing compares to a hard line but this works just fine.No need for tech support so I can’t rate it yet.
5,This a fast an easy upgrade to my computer.  I downloaded the driver from Intel for an Intel WiFi 6 AX200 160Mhz card before I switched cards.  Installed the card then ran the downloaded driver.  Bingo!  Went from 73 Mbps to 562 Mbps with no other changes.  Well worth the money.  I have Xfinity 600 Mbps service through an X1 Modem/Router.
5,I used this in my pc since I did not have a option for Ethernet and so far it works fine I love how the drivers are included in a dvd within 5 minutes it’s a easy setup and a amazing price
5,Easy install. I didn't need the bluetooth support or want the extra cable hanging in the case. Just plugged it in. Turned on the pc and windows 10 installed the driver. Getting a full 150+ Mbs in a relative dead zone in the house. I'm using a Linksys AC5000 router and just future proofing for when there are more devices on AX. I highly recommend this device
5,I had to move my wifi router location.  That meant I needed a wifi interface for my desktop computer.  I installed this interface card.  The speed is much better than I expected.  It is still working fine after two months.  I would buy this again.
3,It seems after multiple attempts multiple times from different adapters on different PC's by different technicians all same result. 5Ghz speed test barely hit 25mbs and constantly disconnect no matter the router or encryption method used (other than open bc I never tried) and the standard inter al adapter I use on 2.4g achieved over 80mbs. My 5g internal adapter hits 875mbs ez. Back to this tplink back to 25mbs barely. I'm using this as an internal bluetooth adapter now and it seems to hold on ok so far. There must be some driver flaw in these adapters as I've heard a couple rumors online they've played around w non whql signed drivers and achieved better speeds. I'm not bothering w all that yet. Just find a different wifi gen 6 adapter.
5,Been using this WiFi card for about a month. It's the best WiFi card I've used in this price range. The Bluetooth 5.0 is great. I love the range. Be aware that you WILL have latency if you try to connect a ds4 controller and a wireless headset. You should be careful to use one or the other at a time not both. I've found this to be the case with all WiFi cards I've purchased.
5,Great product!! My pc was very slow when it came to wifi. Bought this to upgrade my old wifi card and my wifi is way faster.
5,Very easy to install in my gaming pc and improved my Internet from my old WiFi adapter. Very satisfied with it so far and hope it will last for years to come.
4,My daughter lives two floors below the Asus wifi 6 router and she got a good signal without the need for an extender. Her download speed was greater than 300mps. Triple the speed she had before.
5,Does exactly what you want with minimal effort of installing. Really ideal for areas that tend to have high interference. It's also esthetically pleasing
5,The delivery was faster than the deadline with no damage to the box. Easy installation great work on both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04 and no required to driver installation
5,ok so i had an intel ac7260 wifi card that kept disconnecting. this device not only stays connected but i am seeing about a 30% increase in download 100% in upload and the ping went from 40ms to 22ms!!the device works perfectly
4,I have 200mbps 10up getting 70 and 11 up 30 ping better than my old USB adapter with a 3-foot atenae which had 70 ping and 30 down.They should have stated you needed an open USB header for Bluetooth though because now I can't use Bluetooth even though I wasn't planning too.
4,It works very well. Good product.
5,I have tried several device before going with this.  A few other PCIe wifi adapters and a USB 3.0 one by NetGear (not the night hawk).  The NetGear was a close second but the reliability and consistency of this one won me over.  I would not recommend these brands with little/no reputation as they gave me the most trouble.  I haven't tried the bluetooth but I'm sure it works well.
5,Worked great and easy to install.Be aware that using the attena extendor can significantly reduce speed. In an "a b" test I lost about 30% speed by using the antenna and extension as apposed to putting the antenna directly on the card.
4,I didn’t realize you need windows 10 for this to work. I didn’t feel like returning so I upgraded from 8.1 to 10 and it worked after installing drivers. If you don’t have a CD drive make sure you have a way to download and install the drivers.
5,I was converting from an older TP Link PCIe wifi card. My previous transfer rate was 43.59mbps down and 15.80mbps up. Ran a speed test as soon as I installed and updated the drivers for this new card. My new transfer rate is 432.37mbps down and 21.33mbps up.
4,Tech support I gave a 2 because I don't really know. It installed at directed. It works and allows for 2.5 5g ad Bluetooth connection. Over my old N+ card that was rear antenna it got only about 25mbps. This with the top mounted antenna on 5g gets me on average 50mbps or higher.
5,Honestly it works for what I need it for! Bluetooth is bad at the start because the drivers need to be updated but other than that small little update the whole Bluetooth and wifi functions work as god send!
5,Fixed my constant connection problems!!!  Easy to install. You do need to install the driver for it first despite what some of the comments say regarding windows 10 not needing it. Restart the computer and BOOM you have a stronger signal.
5,So far signals are much faster and stronger than my old card. The magnet is strong so sits on the side of my pc really well driver and card installs were seemless as well and I've had it since February.
5,Went in like a charm. It's great having a wireless connection for my desktop and being able to to pair up with my Bluetooth headphones. Signal strength is solid and I've had no problems with it. Definetly money well spent. Liking the magnetic base too.
5,This Wifi card over 100 feet away from the router through a house a metal shop and into my man-cave 5th wheel... it burns the roof down with speed and has not dropped a beat since I have install it. Could not be happier!
5,Getting the speed now that I'm paying for now.  Was only getting about half the internet speed with the other adapter was thinking of running cables but would have been a lot of work.  Got this wifi card and after installing the software drivers that was in the box the speed doubled.  I did have a connection on the motherboard to connect the Bluetooth and that is working.
5,Went from 2-3 bars on the 5 Ghz band to a constant full 5 bars. The router I'm connected to is a floor above me and halfway across the house. The installation process was a snap:1. Downloaded drivers from the ASUS website.2. Uninstalled drivers for old network card.3. Turned off PC and physically installed the new network card.4. Turned on PC and installed the new drivers from step 1.5. Profit!
5,I didnt even have to install any software! just plugged in the hardware attached the antennas turned my pc on and it was already searching for a network! Works wonderfully as well with a strong fast signal!
5,Never in my life have I written a review but for this I just had too. My old WiFi adapter from MSI was completely garbage and once I got this my WIFI increased by 49x LITERALLY!!! Currently week 2 with no problems. Definitely recommend buying
5,Bluetooth is a flawed technology in general in my opinion but the wifi signal stay strong so i cannot fault this product. So if you have a bunch of Bluetooth devices at various distances that you are trying to connect i suggest you switch to wired.
5,My ISP maxes out at 320Mbps and I'm getting that full bandwidth. Installation was a breeze just pop the card connect the internal USB cable and external antennas. With Windows 10 I did not need to download a driver it installed it automatically. I did have another wifi adapter installed though so not sure if it needed an active Internet connection to download the driver automatically.
5,Easy to install. Works great. Can't really comment on wifi range or strength because I'm primarily using this for bluetooth. The antenna mount is sturdy and I like the magnetic base. FYI you can use the antennas without the base and I know this because I completely overlooked the base when installing.
5,Amazing speed and super stable signals - I have never had a Wi-Fi adaptor this stable. I have always used TP for all of my internet devices. They have rarely disappointed me. This device however takes the cake - WOW!
5,My new Wifi 6 router was not found by existing N wifi card in desktop so had to get another one. This one had good reviews so I picked it with about 10 minutes of evaluation. Very easy setup. Both wifi 6 bands immediately found the wifi 6 router. Installed the Bluetooth and install seemed to go ok but have not used it yet.
4,Good Range and good card if you're looking for a Wifi-6 wifi card
3,Bought this for my dad's old pc which was out of range of the house wifi by about 2-3 meters. The hope was that something with these big antenna and long cable would fill the gap between the computer and wifi.While the wifi network did finally appear on his computer the connection was so weak that it was impossible to connect anyways.Not saying this is a bad wireless network card but if you're looking to improve the range on a pc that already has a less expensive card it might be best to look at other solutions.
5,I bought this for the WiFi 6 as well as the Bluetooth 5 and they both work great. My WiFi signal is roughly twice as strong as my previous WiFi 5 adapter. The Bluetooth 5 has a very far range and is the main reason that I bought this product. I tried a competitor brand first but the bluetooth 5 range was very poor compared to this product - highly recommended!
5,I had a Wi-Fi adaptor from NetGear but it was one that plugged into a USB drive it worked really well for years but then flickered so I switched to this and of course this is way faster and easier to install plus no way to break the USB drive so it's nice.
5,I was wondering when I ordered this wi-fi adapter if I could properly install it and get it working. The install turned out to be super easy including hooking up bluetooth which was an added bonus. I am getting great reception from about 25ft from the router with the long antennas.
5,The card was easy to install and sits pretty solid in my desktop's mobo. I skipped installing the drivers from the installation CD that came with it and installed the latest from their website. 10 minutes later I was up and running with 4-500 Mbps speeds. I'm not far from the router (about 35 feet through 1 wall) but eventually I'll move to a further location and test how well it holds.
5,Faster than expected. BT/WiFi connectivity strong. Installed drivers **before** (see attach.)  hardware install. Windows recognized and started test successfully. I use TP-Link Kasa Smart Switches (12) throughout house as well and can't complain about their products thus far...*Notes*Network/ISP: Google Fiber -1Gbps with Orbi Mesh Router & 2-satellitesPC Location: 3rd Floor (1-satellite on 2nd floor)OS: Win64 Pro
5,I was experiencing issues at first. Only bluetooth was being detected until i realised in my bios i had pcie x4 which disables my pciex1/x2 ports i realized this after i had already plugged the card into the secondary pci express 16x port. Its working fine now and have no issues so far. I recommend anyone with issues tripple check bios settings.
5,I got this product in the mail today and was really worried about the install. My worries though soon vanished after reading the instructions and seeing how easy install actually was. Normally my internet speed was 30Mbps with the 2.4ghz adapter I was using before but now I am receiving the full extent of my internet service.
4,WiFi very good .. Bluetooth does not work at all (yes USB connection is correct driver installed) get Bluetooth symbol .. can’t discover anything..disabled it and went back to using the TP-Link USB 4.0 dongle..will remove the USB cable and forget it.
5,Using this in military barracks with terribly unreliable signal using conventional USB adapters. This one hold a solid 5ghz connection and has not dropped on me once.
5,Does it’s job! I was using an Ethernet connection and changed to this. I didn’t do my research and ended up with a motherboard without WiFi (didn’t think I’d need it). Surprisingly this works more reliably and had better speeds than the wired connection!
5,I recently bought a new router that had WIFI6. I had to upgrade my daughters computer and this is what I went with and it was amazing how much faster this is over her old NIC.
5,This is a great wifi card that has given me zero real issues during my time using it.The only problem i really have is that the antenna cables are kind of short so i had to mount it under my desk.
5,Best ever wifi adaptor My testing it has more speed at 75ft. away in the garage than a TL-WN722N USB adaptor 10ft away in the next bed room. I did not expect it to work this well I will test some more and probably buy again!
5,Was easy enough to install with an ASRock B450 Pro4 motherboard. Getting speeds a little lower than expected with a 5G home network but I think it's ultimately because of the router. The antennas feel well made and I really like the magnetized base. This wasn't the cheapest option but I think it's worth having the potential for 2.4Gbps speeds.
4,My old USB antenna was 2 Mbps  (with up to 50 by internet provider.) Now is 24.56  Mbps.
5,Easy to install and the antenna base on a long cord gets the antennas away from the back of the tower.
5,Likes: 1. Fast and stable signals so far;  2. External antenna can easily placed to improve reception;  3.  Reasonable effort required for installation.Dislike:  Bluetooth requires the use of an USB port on the motherboard.  Check your motherboard and identify the spare USB port first if you want to use Bluetooth.
5,Install and setup was super easy. Picks up the WiFi signal and it is strong. I’m getting 500 mb/s upload and download.
5,Great product and super fast/reliable for getting through thick walls! Bought this because we have fiber internet in our apartment complex and need something for video uploads and games. BEWARE: Read your motherboard on where to install the PCIE because some of them need to be in specific slots in order for them to work.
5,We've had this card in service for several month now. It was easy to install performs to specification and works well with our WiFi 6 mesh router. I recommend this card to anyone who wants the additional performance offered by WiFi 6 and has the WiFi and broadband service to take advantage of it.
5,It is easy to install looks good picks up singles great and has excellent speeds.  I was a bit worried buying a cheaper lesser known brand but it is really just the external parts.  The card is still an Intel card like with all the others.
5,Had issues at first which initially thought was defective card turned out to be a defective modem. Works great with fiber optic speeds
5,I got this specifically for its 802.11 ax it is truly a wifi-6 technology.i put -1 easy to install due to no screws for pci-e slot.It comes with CD for installation but who has CD drive these days?Finding the driver for this adapter was near impossible.
5,I just got this product so far not only was it extremely easy to install and use but it also picked up every wifi thing without so much as a thought about complaint. The speeds are exceptional. I think this might be the first tech product I've ever used that hasn't given me issues.
5,Wifi signal were the best I had in a while. Bluetooth works with ps5 controller so I can play ps2 emulation games. I have it connected to an ac2200 router even though it is an ax model or wifi 6.
5,Decided to install this new Wi-Fi card as I needed an upgrade from the on-board Wi-Fi. The speeds from the onboard were 13 Down. Installed this card and received 89 Down. Installation was super easy and quick. The magnetized base is an awesome add-on to this card. Highly recommended.
5,I didn't run into any issues installing the card nor drivers. My wifi signal and speeds improved dramatically from a 150MBps pcie card. I used to max out at around 1Mbps now I'm able to reach around 6Mbps via cable.
5,Some of the negative reviews had me worried. I've been using this wifi adapter for several weeks at this point and have had no issues.
5,Hello firendsDo you have a desktop computer lacking a direct ethernet connection to the router like me?Wayyy to lazy to rearrange your house?Well you really need your WiFi.Much better speeds and Latency [disclosure] I have COX "giggityblast" "panoramic" Intergalactical router.Have they ... totally redeemed themselves?I would say yes unless something blows up.
5,I inadvertently chose a motherboard without built-in wifi and decided to purchase this card to allow me to use my apartment's 802.11ac signal and a bluetooth speaker. Not only do I get excellent speeds and high signal strength I am glad that the card is Wifi-6 ready thus future-proofing my purchase.
5,Ladies and Gents get rid of your USB wifi card invest $30more and get this!!! Huge differences!!!I usually get 100Mbps but now I get 450Mbps!!! Just make sure that you have enough PCI-E SLOT from your motherboard and USB slot to power it up. Easy install. I recommend 300 out of 10!!!!
5,This thing is a GODSEND my PC didn't come equipped with WiFi and this was WORTH even a bonus since it has Bluetooth. Installation was very simple and it was easy to find the proper drivers
5,For an older gaming computer located far away from a new WiFi 6 router this has added new life to the computer.  Very easy to install just remember to disable the existing WiFi adapter which may be built into your computer.
5,All was needed was to plug it in! Instantly recognized by Windows 10 so no complaints there. WiFi 6 and bluetooth were a nice plus as I was just needing a connection after moving my desktop to a different room.
5,This has amazing wifi speed and the bluetooth has FAR better range than my laptop or phone.  Headphones stay connected even outside.  Would recommend.
5,No complaints from my son who games a lot.. speeds were consistent and so much better than built in cards from motherboards. Installed in a 5 year old Alienware Area 51
5,So far so good. I'm consistently seeing download speeds of between 400mbps and 600mpbs. That's with the router supplied by my service provider. Bluetooth works well too. I didn't even have to install a driver. Windows recognized the device upon install. For the price I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable network adapter at a low cost.
5,Es un gran producto y hay que tener en cuenta: para que funcione al 100% necesita que los que trasmiten a este receptor de WIFI 6 y BLuetooth 5 estén al mismo nivel.  De resto va a funcionar sin ningún problema muy recomendado.
5,Absolutely great for an upgrade. Definitely recommend. I went from 250 MBS to 600 MBS after the installation.
5,Increased my internet speed on my desktop from 30mbps to a bit over 100mbps (I pay for Verizon 100mbps). Was easy to install. I didn't bother to connect the f-usb cable to motherboard because I didn't have an open f-usb slot but I didn't really plan on using bluetooth anyway.
1,Do not buy this TP-Link AX adapter your network discovery will not work for more then a handful of seconds.. Let me preface this by saying that I am extremely tech savvy; I have been building PCs since 2012.System:Intel Core i7-4790k @ 4.8GHzGigabyte GA-Z97-UD5H-BK moboWindows 10 64 bitother specs don't matterI recently got WiFi 6 through my ISP so I figured I would step up the game and allow my PC to enjoy the benfits since I cannot easily run ethernet due to living in an apartment. I purchased the TP-Link AX adapter to replace my ASUS PCE-AC68 PCIe wireless adapter. After installing the TP-Link and running the drivers from the provided CD I received approximately 7 seconds of WiFi before the adapter disappeared. I checked device manager and it told me that the adapter had stopped working. I tried to repair the drivers with the CD and that didn't fix anything.The only "solution" was to uninstall the drivers using the CD reboot the PC install drivers again reboot then again enjoy about 7 seconds of network discovery before the adapter stopped working AGAIN. After doing this process 3 or 4 times including trying different PCIe slots digging in the BIOS resetting the CMOS and full power cycling I decided to default back to my old ASUS AC adapter because at least it works flawlessly (in all of the PCIe slots that I tried the TP-Link in mind you).
5,As others have mentioned your motherboard will likely not recognize it after install. Don't panic just download the drivers for it ahead of time. In the box there are instructions with a URL. Works great after that. Antennas work great cables are a bit short but work fine for most applications.
5,I was originally looking for a bluetooth connecter for my pc but ended up stumbling upon this. It works just as good as an ethernet cable and the connectivity is perfect. I definitely recommend if your system doesn't include bluetooth or wifi.
5,Came in proper box feels very well made. It was very easy to install but that could change based on your PC build configuration. My internet speed is basically the same using the WIFI and using Ethernet.***One minor thing to be aware of: the card does not come with the M3.5 screw to mount the bracket to the PC case. ***
5,Strong pickup on wifi signals. Need to download and install the driver from TP-Link’s website before installing this card or it will turn on and off subsequently.Highly recommended!
5,This WiFi adapter has worked as advertised for me.  My motherboard does not have a slot for the USB cable so I can't speak to the Bluetooth performance but it's been rock-solid for WiFi which is all I really needed it for anyway.
5,I was quite surprised as to the performance of this product.  My aging PC has a built in WiFi card that was connecting at approx 30Mbps.  Installed this card and those specs jumped to ~450Mbps (EERO Pro network on a Fiber subscription).
5,This WIFI adapter works well.  The Intel AX200 chip works great with Windows 10 and Linux.  Range is good and I'm seeing 230 mbs in speed tests.  Note my internet connection is good for 300 mbs.
5,Before I bought this I was using a USB wifi receiver and it dropped pretty often. Since I've installed this it's been smooth sailing. The magnets antenna are nice if you have a metal case to keep it in place.
3,I bought this card to pair with Archer Ax6000 router. I intended it to replace an Asus PCE-AC88 (AC3100) card. The speeds that the TP-link card achieved were actually 10-20% worse than the Asus could muster with the TP-Link router. I was underwhelmed; I packed this adapter and returned it. ... I hope that the technology would mature soon and i will have the chance to experience the hype of WIFI 6...Because right now i feel stupid for forking $330 for a WiFi 6 router that has no real world benefit over a higher end AC network equipment...
5,Installed this into my sons gaming PC and the speeds he is getting are close to what it was when connected via the ethernet cord. Its a bit more money than comparable cards out there but I think it was worth it and then some.
5,Great product and really simple to install. The wifi signal is also amazing.
5,This product worked amazing I do not have the proper USB for the bluetooth hookup but the wifi still functions amazing. Xfinity and getting 16mbps upload only ever got 3mbps beforehand. And this is not ethernet connected just wifi!
5,Was using an older TP LINK wireless card and just upgraded it to this one.  The difference is extremely noticeable. But the pix speak for themselves.  And love the magnetic base for the antennas
5,The case for my computer isn’t like other cases. It would’ve covered my WiFi antenna completely but thanks to this I don’t have that issue.
5,getting full speed faster than my LAN connection.
5,This product installed easily (Minutes) and works great.  I didn't have Bluetooth on my PC and now I not only have Bluetooth but the Wi-Fi signal is also MUCH better than my old adapter.If you need a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapter this one is GREAT!
5,Great wifi card does the job and looks good. The range is much better than a built in wifi card on the motherboard. Plus you can take it with you to your next build!
5,Wow is all I have to say. I bought these not really knowing what to expect my room is about 1500 square feet from the router so I wasn't expecting anything amazing. Needless to say I was not dissapointed. This easily got full signal on my PC at about 40mbps I have 150 Mbps regularly with Ethernet but still does not dissapoint. Highly recommend
5,This is a fantastic wifi card very fast speeds. This card goes far beyond what my ISP is capable of providing me so I can not speak to the max performance however the wifi connectivity as well as Bluetooth are excellent. I would absolutely  purchase this card again if I have another need.
5,Wifi card was easy to install and the magnet base for the receiver is useful. The cord from the card to receiver is long enough to put the antennas on your desk. Overall great wifi card with great performance.
5,Quick and easy install. Immediately worked once u installed driver. Used to upgrade sons 2nd hand gaming pc so he can play wireless pcvr with his quest 2. Worked perfect. No issues on 5ghz network.
5,This WiFi card if very good. It has very signal even far away from the router. It gives the the same ping as if I had an Ethernet cable connected directly to the router. 10/10 Would recommend!
5,This has great build quality and fast for what it is yet the updated/newer version that has 4 antennas is ofcourse faster!  If you just need an extra boost at an afforable price THIS would be it!I would easily recommend this!
3,The driver+software package for this wireless card WHICH YOU NEED TO USE IT is DISK ONLY. They do not have a digital download on their site. If you do not have a disk reader then please consider other options. I did not even consider this when buying the product but I do not have any computers with a disk drive at my house. It is no longer a common staple.Outside of that: it works well the bluetooth is kind of spotty (but it's a secondary feature when compared to the wifi). Overall the product is good... The installation is garbage and the tech support is worse.
5,After my previous WiFi adapter (which was actually the same brand as my router) kept disconnecting I replaced it with this TP-Link adapter.  I haven't any problems and have a very stable connection.
5,Turned my old Lenova desktop into a super fast wifi machine. Easy installation and setup. Nice that it has both large and small form factor brackets included.
5,This is an awesome WiFi card works really well and at great distance as well we need it for a computer in another building 300+ feet away from the main building and works perfectly.  Outstanding product.
5,Product works exactly as we need and when it "got lost" in the mail (not the sellers fault) they had swift turn around and upgraded the shipping to next day.
5,Is your internet speed sluggish? Why not try electric meth for your PC!? Just plug this device in and zip zam zoodly bam! You'll be downloading anything faster than you can say poopy poopty pants! 100% worth every penny!
5,Got a Wifi-6 router bought this card to take advantage of the faster speeds. Installed easily and driver from the enclosed CD made it purr like a kitten. Now just need to get my ISP to give me faster internet speeds!
5,Easy to install wonder wifi signal.
5,I had a dell WiFi card and was only getting 25-30mbps. Installed this card and now am getting 160-180 Mbps on average. My home connection is a 200 Mbps connection. Very happy with results.
3,I went from an Asus PCE-AC68 to this and suffered horrible reduction in signal.  From AC to AX with the exact same location I'd expect an improvement with an AX gateway.  I put the Asus outer antennas on this card and my signal went from 174/18 to 432/216.  TP Link needs to stop stealing IP and hire some real RF engineers.
5,It performed as stated no issues to date after 4 months of use.
3,While this product did come with 2 different mounting brackets for the PC back panel neither of them fit my computer (NZXT H510 ATX Case). Nowhere on the product description is the length of these brackets clearly listed either. I had to do some serious bending to the bracket in order to get it to fit. However once mounted the product seems to work fairly well. Definitely an upgrade from the USB-A bluetooth and wifi adapters I was previously using.
5,This was very easy to install (~10 minutes total) and the wifi signal and speeds were better than previous even with a wifi 5 router!  Bluetooth connected fast on the first try.
5,No struggles with the setup. Love that the extender base is magnetic!Was using a common USB WiFi adaptor before. It 5G with 802.11ac but it'd never stay connected to it. This keeps a solid connection to 5G.Should have spent the extra few dollars on this in the first place.
2,I get this error in device manager. I've tried various versions of the driver with no luck.This device cannot start. (Code 10){Operation Failed}The requested operation was unsuccessful.I have a older PC with an ASROCK B85M-itx motherboard- Intel B85 chipset- Qualcomm Atheros AR8171 ethernet chip.
3,I like the download speeds I'm getting now. It was a good upgrade from my older WiFi NIC.Unfortunately I did not enjoy the bluetooth connection. When playing games with a bluetooth controller occasionally my controller would stop responding. It would not disconnect - it's like the program I was using would lose focus. I would minimize and maximize the game window then my controller would respond again. So not a disconnect but more like something was grabbing the foreground attention. I tried two different controller same thing.I switched back to my old generic usb Blueooth adapter and have not experienced that since.
5,Easy to install if you are familiar with building your own PC. The instruction seems clear I didn't need to use it. Anyway if your router supports Wifi6 and you need a Wifi6 adapter to connect to it this is what you want.
5,Got to work with my new wifi 6 mesh system and it made a huge improvement.  Im clocking in at over 700 mbps which is near my gigabit capacity.  WiFi 6 appears to work better through walls.
5,I used to lag a lot while playing video games with my old WiFi card. With this card I don’t experience any lag and it’s magnetic! So I can put it wherever is more convenient. I can be a real gamer now!
3,I'd expect these massive antennas plugged directly into a pci slot to be pretty quick. The instructions say it's supposed to have line of sight with the wifi router but this isn't feasible for most applications. If I could see the router I would just use a cable. My speed was 1/10 what my phone or laptop get in the same room and they don't have 2 6" antennas sticking off them. Bluetooth works well though.
5,Great! Super easy to physically install. highly recommend you get the drivers downloaded and ready to install first. No issues for me moving from usb wifi. Signal passes through 4 seperate walls. I have 220mb down speed. I speed test at ~190 with this.
5,Worked a bit better then the USB version I had. Nothing crazy but there was an 10% increase In speed
5,Great Product my Son's computer's WiFi speed as fast as the Ethernet speed.
5,Okay I never had to call tech support so I made that review up. But I never had to call them. This worked great right out of the package and is still working great.
3,So I just purchased this computer part. The speeds seem to be good so far but haven't done much with it. The big downfall of this product is that neither bracket seemed to fit my computer case. The normal one is a bit too large and the low profile is to small. So I'm stuck with just having it in there with no brackets. My PC case is NZXT S340 ATX midtower case. It's a bit scary not having it secure however I couldn't get it to fit even after messing with it for around 30 or so minutes.
5,Works as advertised. But I have to use a different PCI-E slot than the previous wifi adapter to make it works. Because for some reason the OS think the new card is still the old one and get confused.
5,This wifi card is the best one I have ever had. I GET top level throughput from my Frontier router. Hardware is rock solid and the antenna cable let's me put my desktop anywhere and still get a solid signal.
4,Work's great 50ft away from router. Better than a Wifi Extender.
5,I'm happy
5,To my surprise it actually works! Gets the same speeds as I did on my laptop. Bluetooth stays connected.
5,The speed of my wireless connection is now astoundingly boosted. The installation only took a few minutes to install into my PC with a bit of guided support from a friend. Love my wireless speeds but now I know I need to upgrade my router/modem. Would recommend if you're looking to boost your mediocre connection.
5,When combined with a modern router my WiFi is now maxing out my cable internet speed.
5,Easy install and instantly connected to the internet when I disconnected my USB WiFi adapter
5,WiFi 6 is the real deal. 300-400 mbs up/down from the main router a floor below me. WiFi 6 will truly replace Ethernet within homes now. You don’t even need that over-priced mesh WiFi with this.
5,just dont be an idiot when installing it its not hard. just make sure to have enough room between your graphics card and your pci slot you want to put it in.
5,Bought for my son for gaming. He likes it
5,Buen componente excelente.
5,Was having significant audio lag when using a Bluetooth USB connected to a USB port on my PC case.  Bought this card to connect directly to my motherboard and now the audio is much better.
5,Its slow with the 2.5ghz signal around 20mbps but with the 5ghz works wonders 234 well over my plan which is 200
5,Stable steady and reliable wifi and bluetooth signal are top-notch and have way longer ranges.
5,Snap it in turn on the puter and your all set.
5,Muy buen producto recomiendo la inversión. Lo instale en mi pc de escritorio que estaba presentando fallas con la conexión wifi y la mejoró completamente. La diferencia de la señal 2G a la 5G se nota.
5,on ethernet  cable  i had  latency  60-65with this  antena  i have  70-75  but you can still play game easy without any  lag.Thanks for this product.
5,I love this WiFi card. It has the best WiFi signal
5,This is by fat the best wifi you can get!!
5,Allows me to have a consistent connection without any interruptions.
5,Fantastic speed.
1,I work in desktop support but I am lazy to troubleshoot my own stuff on my own time. This should have been straight forward install. I am writing my review one year later. Never got this device to work. Mainly purchased this so I could play games with my wireless Bluetooth PS4 controller on my desktop. I couldn't get bluetooth to work so I just switched back to USB cable. Recently I switched my network to complete wireless and put in extra effort to get my desktop to work with this wireless device.As others mentioned the device does not show up in device manager. I installed the device drivers updated my motherboard bios and chipset drivers but still no device shows up in device manager. I suspect it's just DoD. I believe they offer 2 year warranty so I might be able to get one swapped out but not sure if it's worth it. I think I'm just going to go pick up another adapter from my local electronics shop.
5,My son loves it fixed his connection issues while online gaming. Internet’s faster with this than any pc in the house.
5,After wasting some money on a few Bluetooth and WIFI dongles I decided to spend good money on something that actually works. I'm very happy with this product the WIFI receiver is very strong and my Bluetooth keyboard connects with no problem.
5,Not only did this connect the computer to the wireless connection of my distant router the speed increase was an unexpected surprise. Simple install process and instant connection after driver install. Will buy again!
5,Anyone who would buy a thing like this knows what he or she is doing re wireless networking so I'll spare us the mind-numbing details. It works flawlessly for me. I'd recommend this to anyone even people I don't like.
5,I noticed no difference between this connection and my eithernet Cable.
5,Amazing signal considering I am upstairs in the house away from the wifi. Perfect wifi card for gaming instead of running a dedicated network line. Always high speeds and low latency
5,No issues with this unit. Works well and reliabily.
3,Honestly wifi 6 is amazing. The latency is in distinguishable from a wired connection.However this link sys AX 3000 has a fake heatsink. It is not connected through any thermal interface to the heatsink plate. There is just a gap of air between the chip and the plate. Its a heat trap not a heat sink.
5,It just worked.  Opened the pc. Installed it on the pcie slot.. good to go. Windows 10.Still haven't hooked up the usb bus for the Bluetooth but will soon.
5,Easy to install. Wasn't too thrilled seeing the external antenna in the box figured they would be cheap but they're not. Has a heavy magnetic base that takes some force to move around.
5,Best wifi card I've ever had. Installed easily. Worked right out the box. Very happy.
5,Not sure what else to really say I was upgrading from an older archer based card in my tower and this thing is getting ~4x the speed and signal.
5,Make my pc wifi run faster
5,Super quick and easy to install worked great immediately. Stronger and faster than my phone and laptop in the same room.
5,Had to move a computer to a location where at least temporarily there will be no network cabling. Installed easily and I am getting the expected speeds and signal strength.
5,I can easily get 300-400 Mbps from my router whereas before I usually expect only 100-200 Mbps. Unlike my older wifi card it worked straight out of the box. No driver installation needed which is really nice given windows updates sometimes would stop the drivers from working. Overall very happy!!!
5,Worht the upgrade. Makes the computer  very fast. Intel chip inside. Steal for money b c if u buy parts outside and built it may be more costly.
3,I had high expectation for this wifi 6 adapter. Installing it in my gaming PC is easy. I use it to connect to an AC1900 router. The speed is lower than expected. I have 500mbps down internet. This provides some improvement over an AC 1200 usb adapter 290 mbps vs. 200 mbps. I may replace the router with an AX in the future to max out the AX capabilities.
5,This works great! I get 750mbps at my desktop which is a room and one floor away from my router.
5,After moving my old WiFi card would no longer get a good signal. Having the option to move the antennas to a better location made a world of a difference!
5,Router on first floor my PC on the second floor I get 452Mbps down and 480Mbps up on a Gigabit connection. No dropouts or needs to reset at any point in the last 3 months. Would buy again.
5,VERY NICE AND FAST EASY WIRELESS ADAPTER.  INSTALLED INTO 16X PCIE SLOT.  USUALLY GIVES ME BETTER THAN 300 MBPS WHICH IS THE RATING OF THE ATT FIBER OPTIC CABLE TO MY HOUSE.  NICE LOOKING. GREAT VERSATILE MAGNETIC BASE. ANTENNAS WORK VERY WELL.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
5,Fast ship easy set up and great speeds would would go out of my my to replace it!Paul H
5,Wow. Super fast and eqsy to install
5,very easy to install and it worked without requiring any extra drivers being installed (for me at least). will update this review if i run into issues with the actual wifi connection but it seems good so far.
5,I don't have a wifi 6 router but I do have gigabit internet with a viber connection. This card helped me to get a huge boost in single for my connection. I'm able to stream smoothly now on twitch no matter what!
5,Got signal in the furthest room for a pc where a usb dongle failed. It is practically as good as wired for normal use. Magnetic base on the antenna is a nice touch
5,Super easy to install. Works like it should imo
5,Needed this because I didn’t want to run a Ethernet cable around the house. Wasn’t plug and play for me but once the drivers were installed this card was solid. No drops in the WiFi as of yet. A solid built card.
4,Good connection.  Magnetic base nice.  Plug & Play.
5,Somewhat pricey but you get what you pay for!  Increased wifi speed dramatically and is future proof for now...
5,Buen producto cumple con lo indicado buena recepción de la señal
5,Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Plug that bad boy in screw on your antenna download your drivers from the included CD and you are off to the races with fast internet (if you pay for the speeds)
5,Works great just make sure you install the supporting software via the provided cd or online
5,so I bought this because I did not have the ability for wired internet. Signal was great and fast. Only reason I returned it was that I needed multiple ports so I bought a 4 port repeater. Recommend highly.
5,Cumple con lo prometido fácil de instalar y los drivers se pueden encontrar mediante actualizaciones de Windows lo que facilita todavía más el proceso. Es prácticamente plug and play.
5,product works great. it was a little difficult to figure out the drivers because I don't have a disk reader. but once i figured it out the product worked great!!
5,Works great. zero issues at all. and its magnetic backing so it  sticks to less interference places easily and the magnetic pull is above average. great purchase. worth the money
5,Great product so far ! Added this to my Z270 asrock extreme4 board with no issues at all .
5,Add it to your motherboard run the cd for the software  and then sit back and relax.  It works
4,Works great easy to install got it plugged it in and installed it with the cd and right away connected right away
5,Easy installation bluetooth and wifi both work great. The antenna stand is magnetic so if you have a steel computer case you can mount the stand directly on top.
5,easy to install fantastic ping and download/upload speeds and installation was easy as eating pie with windows 10 I didn't even need to install drivers myself literally just plug and play
5,easy to install and picked up my 5g modem and connected to it easily. that is what matters. No dropped signals. I am very happy with it. I tried dongels and was always getting dropped signals.
4,I missed one word and led me to 5 hours of trouble shooting a card which there are no drivers to make it work with windows 8.1. Windows 10 only.
4,Love the product. Wished they delivered it to the right address. That would have been nice.
5,Antenna connects wired to card and is easily moved. Magnetic base is a great feature.
5,Effortless install. Functions perfectly. I do get better signal.
5,Great card installed using the intel drivers. WiFi speeds were outstanding!! To find the drivers you can easily search using your favorite search engine intel WiFi 6 pci. You’ll want the AX200 drivers. Be sure to get both the WiFi and Bluetooth drivers.
5,PC used to have tons of wifi errors missed packets etc...Now I get 250Gbts up and down and zero lost packets.Did not have any F-USB port on my motherboard so no bluetooth 5.0 but who cares at least wifi is great
5,I picked this up after having slow speed with my USB wifi.  Easy to install and the speed test after turned out great.
5,Wifi 6 + Bluetooth 5.0. literally plug and play decent price trusted brand. easy simple and awesome.
5,Don't have a disc drive thus had to plug computer into Ethernet next to my router. Windows 10 automatically found the right drivers. SUPER Simple!Speeds are very fast. I see zero notable/practical difference between this wifi card and direct Ethernet connection
5,Nice card good value if you are looking for Bluetooth (BT) and WiFi upgrade to your desktop. BT needs an empty USB port on your motherboard (Not USB A!) keep that in mind. And obviously you need a free PCI slot.
5,Unlike some other crappy Chinese cards this worked perfectly. So perfectly in fact I am now scared. I'm expecting something to go wrong.Wifi just works. Bluetooth just works. Will update if there are performance issues. So far so good.
5,Good range reliable connection and speed. Works fine with router upstairs and this card downstairs.
5,I need to update my WiFi and Bluetooth for my gaming pc and man this pcie card blows my old one out of the water. Definitely Worth it! Also it’s easy to install and works just as good as they said it would.
5,Really speedy when paired up with a wifi 6 router. I noticed the speed of my connection was a bit slow when i initially installed the drivers from the CD. Once you upload through the driver update or intel site ax200 then you notice a super boost in the speed and latency.
5,Really useful to install but make sure your motherboard has a Bluetooth source to be connected
5,I bought this because the onboard wifi that came with my mobo (ASRock Taichi x399) was too weak. It barely detected any wifi signal while other of my devices did it without issue. I installed this WiFi card and it works just as any other of my devices.
5,Works great for my sons pc in the other room. no cable across the house.
5,This is one of the best wifi cards out there my wifi download and upload speed increases by at least 80% I highly recommend this wifi card!!!
5,Drastically improved my connection/speed when compared to powerline adapters which were rated for Gigabit speeds. Bluetooth is a nice feature as well
5,Great signal. Be sure to read the directions and connect the cable for bluetooth.
5,this little guy is so powerful that it destroys my reception on my digital TV antenna across the room!  Be warned. Good buy. Easy plug n play install.
5,Added enough range to sustain 120Mbps connection when prior 5Ghz adapter would only do 50 and cut in and out. Bluetooth seems more reliable than the 4.0 adapter I had previously too.
5,Worked like a charm right out the box. Easy install with driver cd. Didn't need any support so can only do a 4 star there. I very pleased with purchase and would recommend the card. Range is excellent though that depends on your wifi device.
5,After installing the item my new computer hooked right up to our wifi like a champ. We have yet to have any issues with the wifi card.
2,I recently upgraded to an AX network (a TP-link router) and bought two of these cards for two different PCs.  One I never got working.  After two hours of tech support asking me to reinstall the drivers in various ways I conceded defeat.  The other system I installed it in worked initially but then started showing system instability immediately after boot.  After removing the card I was able to get the system to boot again.When the card did work in the second system it performed well.  I was able to get upward of 700 Mbps on a speed test over a 1G upstream link.  I'll give it an extra star for that.  But since both cards became unusable and tech support was entirely unhelpful I cannot recommend this product.
5,Easy to install. Strong Wifi signal.
5,East to install. Get great WiFi signal and seed matches that if my direct wired connection!
5,Works great!! Fixed my wifi problems completely.
5,Good product overall signal excellent and easy to install
5,The wifi card came on the delivery date and was installed within minutes.  Everything worked as described and even meets the speeds listed in the description.
5,I installed it exactly how the instructions said to and it worked right away.
5,Amazing difference between this unit and the one that I purchased at a local store
5,Before I had an older n wifi card and my wifi would cut out almost every 15 minutes.  Now it hardly ever disconnects and I get amazing connection.
5,Not the one I ordered but received this one instead. Works great. My speed went from 62  down to 180 down.
5,Works without issue. Good WiFi speeds. Magnetic base means you can mount it in a variety of locations. Need USB header for Bluetooth but definitely worth it.
5,Connected my existing desktop to my new Wifi 6 router. Now I am realizing the full potential of WiFi 6.
5,Easy setup and fast wifi
5,This product hit the mark for us.  Easily installed and worked perfectly.
5,Easy set up and works great. Speeds faster than wired gig Ethernet with fairly low latency.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy install over 500 reliably through wifi.... I love it!!!
5,Totally awesome this wifi 6 desktop wifi card paired  up with tp link ax1500 routrr I'm getting more than I'm paying for with spectrum I'm only paying for 400 Mbps and in getting just a little over 400 Mbps
5,Worked perfect every time  I have never had an issue with this.  bought 2 of them
5,Work perfect! Good signal
5,This card threw my last wifi card out of the water. I was only downloading files/ games at 500 kbs/ 1 mb a sec with my old wifi card. I installed this card and I started downloading at over 20 mbs.
3,OK so it’s not a bad product. It does what it’s suppose to do. However unless you have a router running ax/WiFi 6 don’t expect huge gains in terms of speed.Yes it’s better than a USB WiFi adapter. But not by a whole lot. Maybe it’s me but just my 2 cents.It may be a big jump for some in terms of speed but it didn’t do a whole lot for me.
5,Installed and got up and running quickly only wish I actually had a wifi 6 router as the eero mesh I just got in august is only 5
5,My son is a big time gamer and bought this. He says it works perfect! That’s hard to win over with him. He thinks everything “sucks”
5,Huge improvement over usb WiFi I was using
5,Simply an amazing product super easy to install absolutely perfect for my new Wi-Fi 6 router. I 100% recommend this item!
5,Great signal improvement! Upgraded from an 802.11n usb and gained soo much more consistent signal!
5,Was skeptical that the card would work with my 8 year old computer - but it went right in Win 10 drivers worked perfectly HIGH speed wifi now - Great product..Love it..And updates to win10 have NOT killed the s/w drivers Very NICE..
5,Easy to install. Great signal. Using with a netgear night hawk ax5400 (rax50). No problems.
5,Bought this to utilize the new speeds my AX router puts out.  MAN i love this getting 500MB up and down via wifi and i am in the basement  at opposite ends of the router/floors.
5,Excellent. No more laggy internet connection. My router is approximately 50 feet away from me through 2 walls and I have no problems maintaining a strong connection.
5,Low latency and fast :)
5,It’s great and I’m on the second floor from my router
5,I was bottle capped using a TP-Link powerline at around 15 mbps downloads and 3 mbps upload. This adapter brought me up to my actual Xfinity speeds with 300+ mbps download and 10+ mbps upload.
5,Ive been using this little wifi dongle for a little over a month now with no complaints and no issues whatsoever! I hope to get a good amount of usage out of it! The signal is great
5,This thing WILL make your net hull *** I have tried a LOT of things to get my speed you to what I want and 99% of them did not work. BUT THIS WILL!
5,Man... from 30mbps to 200mbps after replacing. What can I say? What a beast. Highly recommended.
1,My setup:Router:NETGEAR Nighthawk AX12 12-Stream WiFi 6 Router (RAX120)Use 160MHz channelServer:CLUB 3D CAC-1420 USB 3.2 Type A to RJ45 2.5.Connected to 5G/2.5G/1G Multi-Gig Ethernet LAN port of router.Display speed 2.5GClient:TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000 PCIe WiFi Card.Display speed 2.4GTest result (2GB data was sent from client to server 5GHz):1. The data transfer speed reached 120MB/s to 150MB/s.2. The speed is not stable.3. Compared to the theoretical speed 240MB/s it reached 150/170 = 62.5%.With some researches I thought wifi6 (802.11ax) can only reach ~60% of the theoretical speed. Compared to that of 802.11ac the speed was 130-150MB/s while the theoretical speed was 170MB/s. (150/170=88.2%).Another defect is: after several hours maybe it was 3hours the NIC speed dropped down to ~10Mbps and it was very slow to open website. When I opened the google map it show a lot of pending blocks and I need to wait for a while. Before using this NIC I cannot feel significant deplay. When I restart the NIC everything recovered. After reproducing defect I returned this item.Something good: when I ping my router the time is 1ms. The ping time of my 802.11ac NIC was 2-3ms.
5,Fast can handle our gigabit internet speeds.
5,I had been using junk box dongles to squeak by until now.  This PCIEx1 pcb is easy to install and is 5x faster.  Appears to be industrial strength construction and quality.
5,Bought for my pc which did not have a WIFI card and it works excellent even while far away from the router
5,paired with a Tp-Link Archer 11000 this card more than doubled the speed of an ac access point.Installed easily. No drops in two months use. No complaints.
5,Can't say anything about this product that I did not like. It just works as advertised and works fast.
5,getting full network speed
5,Fast delivery. It took me a little longer than expected to install given that I have an older Dell model BUT once I figured it out it was a piece of cake!
5,Bought for my daughter's computer in college. Works perfectly in the dorms. No issues whatsoever. Easy enough to install that she did it herself.
5,The guide is very easy to follow and the magnetic antennae set is great. Works very well.
5,Product was easy to install physically and installation of drivers was straight forward. Took 10 minutes to do it all. Wifi and Bluetooth both work flawlessly. Highly recommended this.
5,I've been using this for a few months now and I'm very happy with it. Usually puts out 300-500 mbps.
5,Great Performance and Easy install (less than 5 min.)
5,Before installing this on my computer my WiFi connection was unreliable. This WiFi card fixed my issues and increased my internet speed.
5,Does exactly what the packaging says. If you dont get the greatest connection in your room or wherever you are this is for you
5,Easy to install and works well. Wish it came with two screws to attach to the case rather than just one.
5,It works great. Haven’t had the signal drop out yet and it was very easy to install. Id rather be wired but this is the next best alternative to having a cable run across the floor.
5,Easy to install and no more rental fees from our internet provider.
5,Xlnt Wifi adapter! Way faster  speeds than the little usb plug in ones!  Went from 22mbps to about 70 mbps over a plug in usb port  wifi adapter
5,Easy install easy setup great speed... Surprised to say the least.
5,Super easy to install. Good magnet on the antenna.
5,These are amazing. Paired with matching tp-link archer router with 1gb fiber internet. Extremely fast reliable! Wow!!! Best on market. I've tested just about everything.
5,After trying a number of different wifi adapters this is the only one that worked and gave me full speeds.
5,Big improvement to my game streaming.
5,Easy install great signal and speed
5,Excelente
1,I received the Archer TX3000E(UN) Ver. 2.0 which came with a drivers CD. I abandoned disc media years ago and don't have a CD drive on any of my computers so I went to TP-Links support site to download the drivers.  The issue is that they do not currently have the V2 drivers up for download so I had to use the older V1 drivers which are over a year older.  Terrible support IMO.
3,Got me wifi on a tower that doesnt have wifi or bluetooth.  Bluetooth has quite a delay on it.  Im not sure if thats antenna on the card or what but its almost impossible to use with bluetooth audio.  No way it syncs up with on screen.
5,My WiFi speeds more than doubled compared to my old WiFi receiver. I’m getting over 100mb/sec upstairs and across the house from my router.
5,It is working good. Was easy to install and I haven't had problems with the connection to my wifi network nor Internet
5,This Wi-Fi card comes with about everything anybody would want for their PC.Would purchase again if needed.
5,This adapter is huggeee dont get fooled by its small looks on the picture the antenna is literally router sized..
5,I am extremely satisfied with this modem. It has helped me boost my connection by at least 75 Mbps. It's an amazing value for the performance you get.
5,Easy install amazing connection. Best connection out of any other wifi cards I have used fits perfectly into my PC and is definitely worth the $45 you pay for!
5,Good adapter no issues with connecting to multiple devices.
5,i wish i bougth this early i been downloading 6 games and 12 programs for 3 dyas while inplay world of warcraft  no having issues on ping or lag !!  worth every single penny
5,No issues. Updating is better to go to the website instead of using the disc. And getting all of the updates you needs.
5,my onboard wifi was really lacking and getting only 2.3mbps this item right to 100mbps. wish the cable was longer to the antenna needs another 2 feet length of antenna wire about 2 feet.
5,Hooked this up on my pc and it worked immediately. Have had it going for about a month now with no problems.
3,The WiFi isn't stable and the driver of it is too old that it sometimes won't use 5ghz on windows 10 hotspot so not really recommend if you getting it for VR since it's not stable and they don't update their driver
5,Such an improvement over my mobo built in wifi. Steam downloads are stable and consistent!
5,The wifi card works great speeds are great. Price is great. Definitely worth the buy. No issues so far.
5,I have a older home with thick cement walls and once I hooked this up my internet speeds more than quadruple.
5,I have been using a USB Adapter for the past year and a half and I had no idea what I was missing out on. This was a huge step-up.
1,I installed this card in my computer but upon booting up my computer it wouldn't detect the video card. I tried every combination of my expansion cards in the different expansion slots but it would not boot up with this card installed. Waste of 2.5 hours just troubleshooting and now I have to return it.
5,Good product easy to install reliable.
5,Have  a desktop in detached garage and this PCIe WiFi Card works great. I now have a full signal i the garage.  much better then running cat 5 or 6 from house to garage.
5,Works phenomenally well. Super versatile and easy to install
5,Took my internet speed from 5kb to 500mb right after install. Perfect for my gaming pc and i never have lag or latency problems.
1,Believe the product shipped broken. I build PCs a lot and mine works perfectly fine but when the card is installed no matter what drivers I install for wifi I get netwtw.sys 10 error. I tried rolling back drivers about 10 times deleting the current version and installing the version that was out when the card was released and of course tried loading the cd onto a flash drive and loading it that way but still the same error happens telling me my drivers are at fault. I then bought the tp-link AC1200 and installed it and it worked perfectly first restart. Overall I spent hours of tinkering in my settings and even enabling system preferences on certain protocols I saw appear in my event log as errors. Genuine headaches came from this card and I hope anyone else that gets this thing has no difficulty with it I probably just had defective card.
5,Wanted a card to free up the usb ports on an older pc and this was perfect. Connected easily to the network.
3,I will update my review if it improves.Every time I start my PC I don't have WiFi. It requires a network reset on my PC and a restart...every...single...time.I know I repeated myself but I figure if it can do it...so can I:)YMMV of course.
5,This is a good product
5,Very good.
5,Fast speeds. Trustworthy connections. Easy to install even if you don't do this stuff every day.
3,It worked a bit and got me through until I bought a network adapter card....But I expected to get speeds over 50mbs and never did . Now it's back in the box never to be used again. And yes this was paired with fast internet and multiple wifi extenders throughout the house.
5,Very easy to install! Although you have to download the drivers FIRST to get it working when you installed.
5,Good WiFi signal with fast speed. Fairly easy to install. Works great with Netgear Orbi70 router.
5,Super easy to install literally took me 5 minutes. Speeds are just as good if not the same as a wired connection. Very satisfied.
2,Installed in my Alienware Area 51 R2 (about 5 years old with an Intel i7-5820K). After installation Windows 10 (build 2004) would not boot - just a black screen (computer did POST just fine). Had to boot into Safe Mode (with Networking) to get the drivers installed then reboot normally. Once that was completed and it was working the best it would do is 1/3 the speed of the old built-in Intel wifi (60 Mbps down vs. 179 Mbps down). Big let-down. Ended up returning it. Replaced it with a TP-LINK USB single antenna adapter for $15 (Archer T2U Plus) that does a much better job. Got my speed back without any dropouts.
5,The router works flawlessly with Ubuntu 18.04 on an ASUS Z390-A Laptop with an Intel 9th Gen CPU. Plug and play no extra driver installs.
5,Easy to install fast speeds with WiFi 6
1,There is a compatability issue. Do not buy if you have Windows 10 or a Motherboard with and intel wifi built in. They claim there is a fix it does not work. Won't install on Windows 10 THIS CARD WILL BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH YOU! Just trying to install it will BSOD you over and over. Tried 2 cards untill I found this is a known issue. Customer support is not existent! RETURNED!!!
5,Works pefectly!!  Very strong signal!  Easy to install and set up.
5,VERY fast improvement in signal and download speeds vs my Intel 9462ac cardIF YOU HAVE AN INTEGRATED WIFI OR GETTING A BLUE SCREEN AFTER INSTALLING THIS DISABLE YOUR CURRENT NETWORK ADAPTER
5,Surprisingly great wireless speeds. Easy to install. Would definitely buy again.
5,The range is very nice and speeds are impressive definitely worth a buy.
1,I was excited to try out this new Wifi card to boost my signal. I downloaded the drivers from their website first since I dont have a CD-Rom anymore honestly who does. I took out my old Wifi Card and installed this one. Mounted the magnetic base to the top of my PC tower and booted up. No wifi signals were found but no big deal cause I didn't install the drivers yet. I installed the drivers which it said installation was successful I then rebooted. Still nothing detected. I opened up my device manager and saw that the device was not working properly. It was giving me a (code 10) error. I contacted tech support wich was terrible as its chat only and after an hour or so they gave me no useful tips and tried to say it was my PC. I reinstalled my old wifi adapter and it worked fine without installing anything. Not sure if I got a dud like some other people mentioned but the tech support was terrible and its honestly easier to just return it then jump through all the hoops they wanted me to.
5,I’m very happy with my purchase.
5,Got this for my daughter's desktop.  Install was easy.  Drivers worked.  Got what I expected.
5,I’m about as far away as I can get from my router in my house. The WiFi card goes into my PCIe6 slot and fits great.
5,Easy to install.  Gets much much better signal than previous cards.  Very fast.
5,Este producto hace lo que promete
5,Installed in less than five minutes just need to get the drivers from the web site.  Much faster than what I was using even though I'm still using a ac router.
5,Works great and was easier to set up than I was expecting.
5,Really easy to install. Works exceptionally well and I didnt have to download any drivers as windows took care of it for me
5,Fast easy to install great signal. Drivers work fine. Haven't dropped below 4 bars with the router in a different room.
5,Just the fact that its wifi speed is so fast is what convinced me to get this.
5,Installed this because the USB dongle I had previously attached was performing horribly in a new network environment. Rock solid WiFi connection ever since.
5,Bumped my download speed from 1 MB to 40 MB!
5,Works great. Fast speeds. Easy to install but I installed drivers beforehand
5,Much faster speed than Wi-fi 5/AC while using a Wi-fi 5 router.
3,The signal Strength and connection on this unit is great.  Sadly though I can not control the volume on my devices through the windows.
5,Super easy to installAnd great signal!
5,Works as listed and solved my drop issue
1,The product failed about six months after I purchased it
5,Easy enough to install. Just need an optical drive for the drivers. Works better than my Cat-7 ethernet cable.
1,As the title stated...dead within 6 months. It now joins my Archer C7 5400 as another dead TP-Link product.It really saddens me to see the level of quality drop off so much. I've been a loyal user of TP-Link productsfor years. I realize this is a review for the PCI adapter but I just returned a TP-Link AX11000 after failure inless than 30 days. It was bought at a large Club store. TP-Link customer service was willing to offer assistance ifI provided my name email address model number serial number version number receipt and a photo toprove I was providing the correct information. Kinda silly considering only ONE version existed as it was anewly released product and I had already registered it.All in all a $50 adapter should last longer than 6 months. I won't fight for an RMA as it is next to impossibleto obtain..
5,Super easy install! Worked like a charm. Great signal! Great speed for a gaming PC. Arrived on time. Great seamless experience!
5,I'm not mad at the product.  Since I've installed on my computer I've never dropped signal once.
5,It’s amazing product. TP Link card boosts and maximize my wifi signal from16mbs to 450mbs. I would recommend this product.👌
5,Works great with 10 won't work with windows 7.......
5,Very easy to install. Solved all my speed issues with WiFi speeds. No tech support needed everything needed came in the box.
5,Solid performance. Installs easy.
5,was worried about wifi on my pc being weak.  This thing gets full speed connected to my 5ghz channel from several rooms and walls away.
5,working well
1,I plugged in this card into the correct PCIe slot and connected everything correctly when I installed the drivers (which they STILL put on a CD) they gave me a blue screen with system thread exception. My computer had to have windows reinstalled. This product breaks computers.
5,This thing gives me nearly the same Mbs as I'd get with an ethernet cable. Also the bluetooth travels quite a distance
5,I installed this a few months ago and it hasn't had a problem yet. I would recommend this product to a friend.
1,Could not get it to stay in 802.11AX setting. Updated my Bios...software...bus. Don't overpay. All the brands that make the chip only costs around $25 dollars for it. Found this out after all the forums and blogs I went to try and troubleshoot this PCIe. The best slot this card fits into is the box it came in for return.
5,I had it installed in less than ten (10)-min. and online. This Wi-Fi is very fast😉 you better hold on when you get online ! ! ! 🤪.
5,Faster than my porsche:)
5,Great product
5,Was amazing product
3,It works great but only lasted 6 months not sure if I will by another one.
5,Easy to install
5,Huge upgrade over the 1200 I had before
5,Bought this a month ago. I love it. Hella fast speeds
3,T'll know its being worquinpoorly it never ritches the 200mbps of my network I hope to receip some advice from the manufacturer the most  i recive its 120mbps..........>>>>>>>>>>
1,After figuring out why windows was BSODing all over the place almost reinstalling all of my windows OS found there was a driver conflict with my existing Intel based wifi driver from my motherboard.Once I figured that out I ran a speed test on speedtest.net. My download speed with my motherboard wifi was 140Mbps with this great new wifi NIC it was 32Mbps.... TRASH.Returning to amazon. I am sure this will work for some but I can't believe how much slower this is than my on board wifi. I even tried extension cables to place the antennae closer to the router. Nothing helped. Oh well.Be sure to disable your on board wifi device before trying to get this to work or you will be perplexed with the constant windows resets with no real codes to diagnose with just generic codes all over the place causing BSODs.15+ years working on computers and this was no fun to diagnose. Yall need to communicate with OS companies more when developing your drivers TP-Link.
5,Blazing fast speeds and no connectivity issues. Works perfectly!
5,Everything needed was included and speeds are pretty much max for what my router can output.
5,This thing made my internet go from 50Mbps download to 250Mbps.  Need I say more? Amazing value for the price.
5,Great fast card!! It sits a little off on the motherboard but that could be my case it’s an older one. WiFi and Bluetooth are great!!!
5,Very strong signal especially for bluetooth.
5,Very easy to install and setup works exactly as I expected it to. Love it!
5,Ordered and easy to install so far signal is very good and overall happy
5,I replaced a n900 networl card for this one. I have gigabit internet and went from 35mbps to 550mbos with this card. Incredible.
5,Great wireless device. The antenna makes all the difference. Make sure you sit this high up.
5,Works well the drivers were good for windows 10
5,Works like a charm.
5,Good stuff. Thru the walls
5,Excelent. Best net card I ever had. The antenna grants large wifi reach
5,Been using for months now and works great
5,Some put this in for some friends now their speeds rival some wired connections. Quality
3,Got up to around 250 mbps but after 3 months it stopped working
4,Good
3,Shipment was on time and packaged nicely. Easy to install. For some reason it's showing AX200 and only 160 MHz? Could someone justify if this is normal or I got a AX200 instead of an AX3000?
5,Easy to install and set up. Vastly improved over my USB wifi adapter I had
2,Easy physical install of course but even windows 10 would not recognize this unit initially.  Required a driver download from tplink website then reboot into safe mode in order to make this work.  It’s been ages since I’ve needed safe mode for a hardware install.  With a NVME drive it’s impossible to even get into save mode during reboot the old F8 method.  Windows 10 has spoiled me windows 95/vista/XP this was all pretty standard troubleshooting.
5,Excelente producto fácil de instalar ponencia los contenidos 4k con un ancho de banda mayor gracias al wi-fi 6. 100% recomendado.
5,Works exactly as advertised follow the installation instructions and you're good to go !
5,Very easy to install and such great signal strength. Great buy
3,work as a regular usb connection wireless the only good thing is this is going inside to the computer the rest is same pick up same signal as a usb antenna. the bluetooth work excellent
5,I can't believe the speed !!! Don't hesitate...BUY IT !!!
5,Very happy with the performance.
5,I installed the device into an availible PCI-e slot on my motherboard.I am now pulling a gig out of the air. Awesome!
5,works as advertised BT is spotty but I believe that's an issue with the peripherals not this card.
5,it was easy to install and the connection is stable good product
5,Works great. Been using it for about a month now and I haven’t come across any problem.
1,I don't know where to start with this card. My modem for Xfinity is Surfboard S33 checked speed on that I'm getting about 980mbps router setup is TP-Link Archer ax6000. My PC is no more than 8 feet from the router. I get speeds on 5g like 120mbps which is laughable at best. On my phone from same spot with connection to 5g I get 580mbps OnePlus 9 pro. Another issue is with registering the devices. I can't register TP devices without contacting CS to upload physical picture of the device and picture of a receipt. Then TP CS allows you to register a device LMAO. Absolutely backwards!!! If you can just run away as soon as possible from this brand.
5,Works great! Easy to install. I’m getting faster download speeds now. Might up my internet speed from my provider.
5,Excellent qualityeasy to installimprove speed in my Wifi 6 network
5,good
5,Great 👍
5,Improved my desktop's connection to wifi from 50 mps to 600 mps.
5,Good price strong signal.  Works great
5,Tienen muy buena potencia de señal
5,Installed easily and worked as it is supposed to.
1,Works 80% of the time. Doesn’t work 20% of the time which is annoying if you are playing competitive games or doing something for work. Will randomly disconnect from your WiFi and will not reconnect for a while. Buy something else because this card is garbage!
5,Easy to install and set up. Pretty much works out of the box
5,Works great easy setup
5,My PC now has WiFi. It is very fast WiFi. This pleases me.
5,had to install twice to get blue tooth.
5,doubled my download pretty nice no trouble installing worked right away.
5,Good
5,Works amazingly well.  I'm impressed with the consistent speeds I'm getting now.
5,From all the reviews everything was exactly as stated and very pleased with the performance
5,easy to install works well
1,As soon as I install it I get blue screens. My only solution is to restart it all over not good at all....
5,Works just as it should so I can connect to our new WiFi 6 router I am stoked!
5,Dual band works (2.4 and 5 ghz). A little expensive.
5,totally worth it I get the full speed from the router
5,a very powerful component the wifi and it's magnetic base
5,WiFi speed went up significantly. Easy install Great product!
1,Had an old card in my 1x PCIe slot removed the old card placed my new TP LINK TX3000E Wi-Fi 6 card into the same slot powered up my machine and immediately smelled something burning / smoking. I immediately powered down my PC. I removed the TP LINK Wi-Fi card from my PC slot and tried putting in my old card into the same slot to see if the motherboard had fried or the TP LINK Wi-Fi card. Sadly it appears that my motherboard was the side that fried. The old card will no longer work in the same slot it used to be in after my TP LINK fried my PCIe slot. Never had a single issue with this PC I built until placing this card inside my case.I used to like TP LINK stuff too.Computer Specs.Motherboard: AsRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 XECPU: Intel 7900XCPU: EVGA 1080 tiPSU: Corsair AX1600i
3,Odd shape - won’t allow for screwing in without disconnecting from motherboard. Installation -required- the included disc. In 2020. Otherwise great signal strength.
1,I was really excited to get this card in my PC.  However i could never get the card to function 100% beyond the Bluetooth...Bluetooth worked great.  IU have Windows 10 64-bit on my PC but it kept dropping the card (not recognizing it) and the software (drivers & wifi control software) from TP-Link did not help or seem to do anything.When i finally got it working it was extremely slow on 2.4Ghz & 5Ghz; around <100mb and the connection would only last 10 minutes max.  Tested in both PCI-E 1x slots and every USB header on my board while PC was 8ft from router.  I decided to run ether cable instead.Everything in the box felt very well made and the base has VERY strong magnet(s).  Not sure if it was user error or hardware issue on either the cards part or mine.
5,Nothing bad to say about this card.  I really like the cord and magnetic base.
5,Perfect for Wifi if you dont have a cabled home or doing a LAN night
5,Quality product.  Out performs my out of date NETGEAR AC600 by a mile!
5,Improved speed greatly and easy to install!
1,I am absolutely fed up with this wifi adapter.  When I bought this pcie wifi adapter I thought I wouldn't have to deal with normal issues.  Thats not the case. It constantly unconnects. I have to unplug it and put it back in. I reinstalled the drivers multiple times and still constant problems.  When It does work it works phenomenally. Having to do all these things to get it to work just isn't worth it. I even called the tech support and after 30 minutes on hold they gave me some lame advice and what I should do to fix it. Which I did. And to call them back if the issue continues. Needless to say it still drops connection. By connection I mean it doesn't if detect it. Don't waste your money on it. Buy something else.
5,painless installation - high quality signal
5,This arrived as pictured.  It's quality and easy to use.
5,Easy to install - quality Plug-and-Play WiFi card.
1,I was optimistic about this product reading the reviews. The connection drops almost ever day. The pci connection is loose despite having a brand new motherboard ( the other components are fine). Frustrating i wish i could return.
1,Card works well for WIFI when it's not causing my system to reboot. My BT mouse would randomly disconnect too. I did further testing diagnosis to make sure other hardware was not the cause of the problem. My issue was without question due to this card. I even got the drivers from their site since I don't have a cd rom drive.The most obvious sign was it did not have this issue before the card was installed. Card in it has problems. Take the card back out and it has run for days without the random reboot.Kind of surprised since I've had very good luck with TP-Link in the past.
5,Great value card. at 300 mb possible I get 200 stable at 5g!
5,Me encanto muy bueno
5,Very nice fast and reliable.
5,High power wifi card very good
5,works as advertized
1,Worked good for the first 9 months then constantly keep getting disconnecting from wifi.Things I've tried:Multiple different wifis: randomly disconnects from all.Updated drivers: still random disconnects.Rolled back drivers per online reviews: still disconnects.I'm now going to order a different card and hope it lasts more than a year.
5,Excellent card for wifi and bluetooth
1,I bought this because I need to move my pc into a space where ethernet cable isn't accessible. I installed the card and the drivers myself and it worked great at first startup the next day after my PC had power cycled it didn't recognize the card anymore. The Bluetooth feature was also not present. I tried inserting the card into another pci-e slot on my mobo and it was seen by the system again. Next time I re-started it was back to being missing. I tried TP-Link support they were useless and just went circles around uninstalling and re-installing drivers. Did nothing. I finally just pulled the trigger on a new wifi card from a different manufacturer and it worked perfectly no interruptions on reboot. Maybe I got a bad card but in any case the support was awful and sounded like they were just asking me repeat questions from a manual on their end.
5,10 minutes to install and went from 40 mbps to 280.
5,Great
5,Easy set up and works great!!!
5,wifi speed is way too fast.
5,Internet was getting slow. Bought this new Wifi Card and boosted it 3x
5,Easy install. Works as advertised! Fast and reliable connection. No complaints.
5,Getting extremely fast speeds both upload and download!
5,The service was great came super early five stars all day
5,Great connection. Fast and future proof. Feels solid and nice build quality. No complaints.
5,Exactly what I needed
5,Great option
1,Like it does for many of the other reviewers here my TP-Link adapter will disconnect from even full-strength wifi signals randomly after anywhere from 20 minutes to a few hours.  Adding insult to injury it then never reconnects to them unless manually told to.  Once the adapter completely failed to be recognized by windows until I re-seated it in the PCIe slot.  Total garbage especially considering that I've been using the product for less than a year.  Stay away from dodgy TP-Link products they're never worth the slightly lower price you pay.
5,Speed increased from 15MB to over 100MB huge difference!
5,Webt from 75mps to 200mps.  Worth the money
5,It’s just plug and play...and really good quality A++++
2,Works fine but after my computer goes back from hibernation Windows Device Manager does not detect it and it requires a cold boot to get back online.  Have tried the Windows fixes for power management and PowerShell scripts to re-enable but no dice.  TP-Link's website is equally useless.  Lame.In the market for another product.
5,the price and fast enternet
5,Works perfectly!
5,really fast and easy to set up.
2,I plan to upgrade to WiFi 6 later this year but figured I could buy the router since it said it was backwards compatible.  Nope.  Constantly drops signal on 5hz with my WiFi router I've messed with modem settings reinstalled drivers the works.  Nothing.  Works fine on the 2hz band.  Look up other reviews on here and elsewhere on the internet and tons of people have the same problem.
2,I have no idea as to why my ping spikes constantly with this WiFi card but it makes it near impossible to play games on the internet speed it fine but my ping jumps constantly and I get booted out of the game. Very unsatisfied
1,Installed card and device properties states "This device cannot start. (Code 10) [Operation Failed]". Attempted to use the drivers provided on the CD from TP-Link's website the chipset manufacturer's website (Intel) and the drive Microsoft has flagged as the most recent version validated by them via Windows Update. An hour-long hold to speak with a person resulted in being told that to make it work I will have to revert my current Windows 10 build to the earlier 1709 version and no resolution in sight meaning I would have to leave my system in a compromised state until I replace the card. I liked the card's features and placed more hope in the product or support than I should have. Returning.
1,I was very disappointed with this product.  The WiFi did not work after the hardware was installed even though the accompanying CD indicated success.  Unfortunately Bluetooth was not installed due to a hardware incompatibility with my computer (no F_USB connector).  I expected that the WiFi adapter would easily connect with my TP-Link AX1500 WiFi router but that was not the case. Product technical support which features chat mode (no interaction with a person possible) was extremely unsatisfactory ineffective and included long wait times in order to connect.  After working with a technical consultant and too much time spent trying to make the product work I gave up and returned it for a refund.  PC hardware and software should be user friendly and easy to install.  This one is neither.
5,Great product. Easy install
1,I bought this card expecting an easy install for reliable wifi but got the exact opposite. After installing the card and updating the drivers it crashed my router every time I tried to connect. I then spent more of my time scouring forum posts to find a solution only for this lemon of a wifi card to cap itself at a steady 200 Kb/s. Throughout the process the TP-link FAQs and help forums have been completely useless forcing me to look elsewhere for solutions. Do not trust this seller or their garbage quality hardware
1,Just terrible  Installed this card into a brand new Dell Workstation expecting great things and found that it was slower (via speedtest) than any other computer in the house.  Worse the card frequently drops connections  - I was trying to download a 1 GB file and finally gave up because it kept resetting the connection and the download was failing.Finally had to pull the card and go with a TRENDnet AC1900 High Power Dual Band Wireless USB Adapter.  Speeds more than doubled and timeouts disappeared.Complete junk - avoid.  What an unbelievable waste of time
5,Great wifi and Bluetooth great range and signal.Movable antenna.
5,Seems to be a good wifi adapter so far.
5,Receives faster than my internet can push.
2,Installation was so-so but only Bluetooth worked. Going to have to return.  I never even saw an option for wifi in my network settings. Tried to install the driver multiple times.
1,I have an issue where this card gets turned off when I put my computer in sleep mode and won't turn back on. I see several references to it in their forums but no fix. The closest I see is "please contact us directly" which I have not had the time to do yet. This is obviously a problem (possibly a conflict with the motherboard I have an X570 Steel Legend and others reporting the issue had similar MoBos) so the fact that they don't have an easily found help article for it is unacceptable.Buyer Beware especially if you have that type of motherboard.
5,Excelent signal.
3,did not know I needed a usb on the motherboard free
5,Easy to install
5,Excelente producto
5,Perfect
5,Pretty good :)
5,Works
5,great overall no complaints
1,This looked like a great product on paper but I never could get the Bluetooth to work. I thought I would try and TP-Links customer support department and after many try this and get back to us attempts they finally decided to RMA the product thinking it was defective. Well after waiting a week and my return said pending shipment I decided to just cancel the RMA and return the Adapter to Amazon for a refund. To my surprise I was told I couldn't cancel it was already in the RMA process to which I said it hasn't shipped so cancel the RMA and then I received nothing but silence from the customer support person. I don't recommend this product or this company to anyone!
5,Works like a charm.
1,I installed the device then the drivers and computer went blue screen from a network system error. Device is defective and took 6 months and 2 geek squads to unplug it and fix my computer. They won't let me return it and it's only good for a paperweight. Bought a $30 USB wifi antenna as replacement never a problem since
5,Just what I wanted
5,Wifi and BT works very well
1,Even the star reviews only ask for "wifi signal tech support and easy to install" doesn't mention anything about bluetooth.I only bought this because all the headphones these days are wireless. I didn't want to take up a USB spot and this sounded like a perfect solution. I wanted to make sure to get the latest possible bluetooth version and everything.The sound is so absolutely terrible I thought I had broken headphones. It sounds like you're listening through a cup with a string sticking out the bottom of it. I Guess I'll try and return it and buy one of the cheap USB adapters.
2,I was getting 200mb/sec and installed this to lower it to 100mb/sec. Should have kept my money not an improvement and does nothing for me on my gigablast network. If you just need to have wifi it works but don't expect your rated speeds.
5,nothing so far
2,I thought it was advertising as an all in one master router on a computer...... It does not have the power as a wifi router. And what it wants to be I could just buy a UBS 2.0 or 3.0 stick and have better results in price and performance......
2,This is a crap product. Sometimes it just disconnects from WiFi even though my last network adapter didn’t. If you want a descent WiFi 6 card consider increasing your budget for it to get a quality WiFi 6card.
1,Doesn’t work with my pc installation was too difficult as well.
1,Downloaded the drivers via. TP-Link support page only to have my HD and Windows 10 files corrupted leading me to lose multiple job projects as well as hours of troubleshooting just so I could get my old wifi card working.Do not recommend purchasing this until TP-Link starts actually responding to the folks who fall for their advertising of it working with certain MoBos. Online support did nothing but only ask for my computer specs before hanging up.
5,Nice for the price!
1,This was a nightmare installation. In the i was dragged through a firmware update whichWas supported by my motherboards manufacturer but not the builder Dell. Apparently my pc should not be running windows 10 but it is.  So after several of these fixes all from third parties the first party stated they had no fix for the mean time. The end result was not being able to get both WiFi and blue tooth to function on the same motherboard at the same time.  I bought a Cudy and solved all issues.
1,The tower mount came bent not allowing the card to seat correctly into the PCI-E slot. When installed would cause computer to blue screen on start up. I imagine this is a good card if it would seat correctly but I was unable to test it as it would cause my PC to blue screen. I imagine the blue screen was being caused by the improper seating.
2,Using it with another antenna I had from my old PCIE card it seems to work fine but I wish the antenna wasn't broken.
2,Didn't have a stable connection even after moving my computer throughout my house. I was at most 10 feet away from the router with no walls in between me and it.
5,Improve WiFi
1,this wifi card sucks to be honest. super easy to install like every other wifi card(though the usb connection is flimsy) card is rarely recognized and when it is its being recognized as a different card(one that this is based off of). just pass on this and go for something cheaper definitely not worth the money at all. just please listen to the bad review like i did not. please
1,I purchased this item September 25; it broke/malfuntioned/pc could no longer read or recognize it working about 2-3 weeks later. It did not fit really well in the pci-e slot: trying 2 pci-e slots.Amazon prime is the best of course and refunded me.I purchased the asus adapter and no problems. The asus adapter fitted much better in the pci-e slot and no issues so far.I warn people buying this $30-40 adapter. The quality is no good.Thanks for reading.
3,Received but slower than expected
1,Bluetooth just refuses to work on windows. States Intel wireless bluetooth error. Downloading the latest drivers from the TP-link Product support page uninstalling everything reinstalling  does nothing. Just absolute garbage
1,I installed this in a 6 month old high-end PC build but the driver installation corrupted the Windows 10 installation resulting in a blue-screen loop upon system boot.This was reproduced across three subsequent Windows 10 installations. On the final installation where Windows 10 was installed with the PCI card in place the blue-screen loop occurred prior to the Windows 10 installation completing fully.Vendor was not helpful in providing any guidance on this issue outside of gathering additional data from the broken system. This is understandable but unfortunately it isn't reasonable to keep a system in an unusable state long term for troubleshooting.
1,After installing the card my PC had a different boot cycle it would start up turn off then boot up normally. I submitted an issue with my motherboard manufacturer troubleshot the issue concluded it was the WiFi card since when the card wasn’t plugged in the system would boot normal. Talked with tp-link support and they didn’t really provide any insight to the issue and insinuated that it was the motherboard.When the system was on and running the card would drop signal occasionally. All the correct drivers were installed I tried from windows and the tp-link itself.
1,Hardware installation is simple. Driver installation is also simple. Bluetooth works but the wifi driver won't start. I have installed/uninstalled the wifi driver several times and have gotten and installed the latest version from Intel but with no success at all. I have looked into several articles and videos that address driver start issues (some from TPLink) but nothing has helped.I will likely have to return this adapter That is a shame - I would much rather not.I note that one other person seems to have described the same driver problem and had to return it.
1,Unless you want to keep reinstalling this piece of hardware every time you want to have wifi I would advise against buying this over priced metal.
2,It's back in its box.. wouldn't stay connected for more than 30 or 40 mins at any given time... I went back to my cheap $11 card.
1,Installed this onto my Z390 AORUS ULTRA motherboard (Gigabyte) and right off the bat I could not fully startup the system. It would either crash during startup or crash immediately after seeing the desktop (on and SSD boot drive). Tried uninstalling the card installing the drivers and then reinstalling and had the same result. This shouldn't be this difficult and frankly I find it absurd. I'm not going to waste my time trying to get this POS to work and will return is ASAP.
2,I'm getting faster download speed and upload speed with that small netgear ac600 usb adapter and it's the same price! SAVE your time and just order that ac600 or something else I'm returning this as soon as possible.
1,I recently brought a new TP-Link AX3000 router and thought I would boost my speeds by replacing my TP-Link PCIe wirelss card from 3 years ago.  All the pieces and components were easy to install and seemed very sturdy but when I ran the speed test my speeds were about 1/3 slower than my old wifi card. I tried adjusting everything and even moving the magnetic base closer to the router but after swapping it for my old Wi-Fi card it's still got faster speeds. Returning to Amazon.
2,Installation worked very well. Drivers updated instantly. Wifi and BT works with no problem. HOWEVER speeds remains way low and not so great. Wish there was more help and guide to configure the Wifi to obtain the best result for the money spent.
1,This card was easy to slot in and install and the Bluetooth works great. Unfortunately while I saw download speeds skyrocket stability went down the toilet. I've had plenty of network hiccups I wasn't experiencing before and my Zoom calls consistently drop now.After slotting my old A/C card back in everything cleared up. Stay away!
1,Got two (One was given to me by mistake) and both don't work. The BlueTooth function will work just fine but the Wifi part doesn't. Hard to believe I would encounter two dead adapters in a row. Do not bother trying this.
1,Lot of people say they're able to get theirs to work I was unable to do so. Sent mine back a few days after getting it. I currently use the TP Link AC 1300 and it works fine after getting the drivers installed which can be a pain if you dont have ethernet. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on this. The AC1300 is much cheaper and will more than likely work on your system. Otherwise just get a Netgear USB wifi card
1,Built several computers and I have installed several similar cards from other brands. As soon as it was plugged in I got BSOD. Went through 30 mins of troubleshooting then tossed it back in the box to amazon. My current card works i just wanted an upgrade. I'll stick to reliable brands that make an effort.I am sure i could get it working but if it is a pain to get working i doubt i will get the speeds advertised without jumping through more hoops.
1,After installation this never worked. Waste of money. Installation cd came broken and was unusable.
2,I don't own any optical drives and the only way to run their software is from a CD. How can you not have a digital download on your website?
2,Just look so odd and ugly in my build
1,Bluetooth signal not strong Product failed in 61 days. Not warrantied by Amazon so must deal with TP link. Layer upon layer of non native English speaker pseudo support. Demand I pay shipping to return the product for testing. Will not refund money. BUY SOME OTHER PRODUCT!!
1,I have four WiFi networks in my house and it would not connect to ANY of them. Every other device in my house connects with no issues.I was only able to get it to connect to another device by using it as a hotspot but the moment the bandwidth usage goes up to over ~25 mbps or so the latency spikes dramatically. It goes from ~15 ms to around 100... LOCALLY. Don’t bother with this crap. I’m going to return it.
1,The wifi work great but the bluetooth does NOT work.  Technical support at TP-Link is worthless.  The rma return process is cumbersome.
1,I've installed multiple wireless adapters before and built multiple PCs from scratch. I installed this one with Bluetooth capabilities and my Windows 10 PC only recognized it as a Bluetooth adapter. I couldn't fix this myself. I spent a fruitless 90 minutes with TP Link tech support chat before getting a Blue Screen Of Death for an unknown reason but after that the adapter miraculously worked but was sloooow. It took some adjusting/updating to get it to work properly. I should emphasize that TP Link support was quite clueless.
1,I bought this to outdo another brand WiFi card I was using as I have gig speeds. It would not go over 600mb at 10 feet from router. Not impressed and returned the item. Not a good choice for gig speeds. Said it could handle it but doesn’t.  I have been having an issue with all the newer TP-Link products lately. I got a newer router and it won’t allow speeds past 700mbs older TP-Link routers will.
2,There are no screws to come with the package. There isn’t clarification on the needed screws either
1,The F USB cable shipped with this unit will not fit most F USB connectors on motherboards  IE: DellThe unit comes shipped with a 5 pin connector whereas most motherboards made with the last few years have 6 pin connectors.  After hours online with support they had no answer except to say all F-USB connectors are 5 pin.  After sending them photos of the 6 pin connectors they (sort of) admitted that their unit is out of date.
1,At first I was impressed but then it just went all downhill.  But after weeks of trying to fix the issue it just stopped working.  TP Link support center wasn't much help to fixing the issue. Of course outside the return period.
1,This product never worked in my PC. Every time I tried to install it it made my PC stop working and as soon as I took it out it would work again. I installed the drivers uninstalled and reinstalled them as well as reached out to tech support and it never worked.
1,My cell phone gets better speeds on the Wi Fi than this card does. Garbage. They tout this thing like it is an AX3000 rated device. It's the same Intel AX200 chip as every other PCI-E 1x vendor on amazon right now. I have a TP-Link Wifi 6 mesh network and plugged into a node I get 900 down 980 up but on this wireless card I get 110 down 90 up. False advertised garbage.
1,Buyer bewareThe installation of the drivers for this caused a corruption of the chips set drivers. That caused a blue screen of death with a hard drive corruption. Entire computer had to be wiped. Don't buy this. Never did work either.
1,Just got gigabit internet installed with at&t.I get 950mbps from a 50 foot ethernet cord.I plugged in this wifi card and now I get 320mbps. I'm one room over from my router. 1 wall.My iPhone 8 pulls 400 in the exact same spot.0/10 absolute garbage.Pay someone $50 to run Ethernet :(
1,I have been in IT for over 20 years and when i seen a review saying this card did not last a week i figured it was just someone that didn't know what they were doing. I was wrong!! Mine lasted three days. China junk just like MSI. My first impression of TP link was my last.
1,Buyer beware decided to go with Used-Like New because it would arrive this week.  However had to get it refunded because item arrived missing the USB header cable for the bluetooth connection to the motherboard.
1,Very poor quality because it requires1) F-USB/USB2 port in motherboard; else cant be installed.2) Network setting is not stable. gives up the network every now and then.later i tried basic ping test and latency seems very high. I tried default PC network adapter (QCA9377 802.11AC wireless adapter) which gives more stable connection and network setting never gives up. Probably I got a bad item and needs replacement for sure.
1,The setup guide says to use the CD. I don't have a CD player. This is 2020 not 2003.I installed the drives from the website for my card. Reboot. Nothing. Zero zilch. Nothing.Device manager shows the cards but with a yellow explanation symbol. Hard to recommend a card that has such poor support and instructions for installation.
1,False advertising. With Verizon gigabit connection and the router about 20 ft away this could only pick up 200 Mb. At the same time it would cut out intermittently.So while it was faster by a little bit than my 5 year old outdated card it was less consistent and not worth the full price and bulk it added.
1,It just stopped working after 10 months. Not detected by windows 10 home. Tried reinstall of software but according to troubleshooting the software was not being installed since there where no Bluetooth or WiFi icons. Tried downloading latest software from the Intel site and that did not work either.
1,The only thing I can review about this card is that it doesn't work.  It loses connection every few minutes and  must be manually reconnected.  Uninstalled and reinstalled drivers still no good.  I have a tp-link USB 3 dongle that has not once lost connection.  Returning and trying a different brand.Using on a Windows 10 64bit OS.
1,Box looks like someone threw it in there after using it its dusty damage to the cable nothings tied up and booklet and cd look grabbed up.
2,Constantly disconnects from signal.
1,The device shows up in device manager as an AX200 device not AX3000. Highly suspicious and not at all what is being advertised.1 star until TP-Link explains what is going on here. Until an explanation is offered keep in mind that you may very well be buying something far removed from what is being claimed and presented.
2,Failed after just over 2 years
1,In device manager says 'cannot start'. It is 64bit Win10. I downloaded new drivers and installed - same thing. Some say use another PCI slot - have not done that yet. Still looking for fix. Not easy.
1,As noted by several other people already the wifi portion of the device failed to work. I received errors after installing in my system. The bluetooth worked although that was powered and attached through USB which in and of itself is super weird but is standard on this type of wifi card.
1,Wasted a couple of hours trying to get this to work Bluetooth worked okay but I couldn't get Wifi to turn on. Kept getting code 10 after installing the driver. Other users had similar issues. If you want a plug and play solution don't buy this. I'm returning mine.
1,This product worked for all of one month. Then issues started happening with WiFi signal dropping in and out and not to mention cable for WiFi antenna  is too short. Don’t buy this item.
1,Bought in feb start dropping connection and stop working in october.At first I thought it was the ISP then I speed test my other devices and they're all normal. Connection would occasional drop every 2 hours then it stop working.
1,This device is terrible it worked fine for a couple weeks and now every five minutes it just stops working and has to reconnect to the wifi.
1,The only thing that came in the box is the card. The base and both antennas were not included in the box.
1,This product doesn't work with Windows 10 because of the Windows 10 fall update. The drivers are not up to date with the update and they don't work. I hope that TPlink can fix there drivers to make this work.
1,Never worked as many have reported. Device not found and driver install did nothing. I don’t have time to commit hours to finding a work around. It’s going back.
1,This product requires an open USB port on your motherboard and if you're like me and matched the number of USB ports that the motherboard has to the number of USB ports your case has you're SOL.
5,Well thought out product giving new lease of life to a 10 year old system. Happy with wifi speed plus added bluetooth 5.2 capability.  Note as mentioned Win10 (64 bit) to function without any compatibility issues. TPlink has included low profile bracket for those installing this on a slim tower case. Which saves alot of hassle. PCIE slot on mobo with 1X 4X or 16X lanes should work on this adapter. For bluetooth functionality adapter card has power connector which should be plugged into an available USB header on the motherboard. Most motherboard should have more than 1 USB header or you may want to dedicate one for this at the expense of those unrequired USB ports laying idle.
1,would not recommend disconnects from wifi on 2.4ghz every 35 minutes very annoying.  I have newer gaming rated router wifi is not speeds advertised on 2.4ghz. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO PULL YOUR HAIR OUT!!!
1,WiFi works great but I already had a WiFi card I purchased it for the Bluetooth which Does not work. I called tech support and they said to try it in a laptop. Duh it’s a desktop pcie. Returning ASAP.
1,It shorted out my ssd drive and caused me a huge PITA - returning it is junk! Also didn’t come with the anttenas!
1,Does not work with windows 10. Couldn't even boot with it installed. Tp link has one of the worst reputations for anything wifi related.
1,Item did not work. Trying multiple network cards proved pc was alright however this card would just not function. Tested on a 64bit windows 10 pc with latest updates.
5,Almost 1 year of use. It is perfection in person absolute speed zero loss with respect to wiring and I have a wall in between. Impressive. I tested it on a 500Mbps connection and it gave me every last bit possible. I would buy it again in this and the next life.
1,trash. Im beginning to think tp link is a bunch of liers. im using the PCI card with the tp 3000 router 10 feet apart and i cannot get over 300.dont buy its bs.
1,I bought this only to find out it will not install on my motherboard with the integrated but now faulty NIC.
1,Very suspicious about this item!!! It may be false advertising- selling another product not what’s described on the box. My device manager says it’s an AX200 not an AX3000 that is what I paid for!!!
1,Not sure have this is so highly rated. It drop connection at least every few hours making gaming hard at times.
1,Had it for 2 months and already repeatedly dropping wifi connection saying "no internet" in windows pretty often. Clearly not ready for the market yet
1,I was disappointed. I sent it back.The wifi worked well but I needed the full capability.
1,The card just died today.  Internet dropped and the system doesn't even recognize that the hardware is still connected.  Re-installed the drivers for BT/WiFi no luck.  Worst $50 I've spent.
1,I bought this first wifi card and it did not say in it description that it required a cd player for my pc. Which I dont have.
1,Product came pre-opened and covered in finger prints...
1,It didn't work. Doesn't show up in my devices I tried troubleshooting it for days to no avail. Don't get it.
1,Need reconnect to get internet all the time
1,Waste of money ... horrible connection
1,Windows 10 only. No other drivers. Dissatisfied.
1,WiFi drivers never worked. I got bluetooth running but couldn’t enable WiFi.
1,Drivers cause bsod
1,I got 2 of these both would crash my entire router within minutes of connecting to my network.
1,Terrible for gaming drops signal way more than any other adapter I've used.
1,stopped working after 2 weeks.
1,Not good
1,It worked for a day then the motherboard stopped recognizing it.  Junk.
1,This item did not work for me. The computer did not recognize it
1,Works for about 30 seconds after PC boots
5,This review has nothing to do with how the item arrived (Amazon has no control over items shipped through other carriers) and the item was ordered through the retailer not through a small business.The product (TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000 PCIe WiFi Card (Archer TX3000E)) was undamaged and in new condition with all parts in heat sealed bags that I would expect. Product inserted into pcie slot without issue and planned ahead to consider the usb plug in that came included some consumers may need to add an internal usb splitter to gain more slots if their motherboard comes with only two.Depending on your personal computer competency installation of the drivers may be slightly difficult but following simple directions would prove successful. No issues arose and drivers were compatible.12+ months of use and no issues arose no dropped signals speeds are as advertised and product has not given any error reports.
5,I found that it was easy to install and hook up. I hardly know it's on my desk except for the powerful signal.
4,I have worked in the computer industry as computer and network administration so I know how to install cards.  I build my own PCs and I know my hardware.  But still this theoretically simple installation wasted too much of my time.  After installation I experienced the issue of WiFi networks only being visible for 1-2 minutes after the computer booted.  After that all of the networks that were initially available disappeared and the PC would say no networks available which was absolutely false.  The hardware manager recognized the card as working properly.I tried reboots uninstalling the drivers reinstalling new drivers downloaded from TP-Link and reinserting the card into the slot after checking the USB header connection.  Nothing worked so I contacted TP-Link with the issue.  After several back and forth emails suggesting I do what I already tried along with additional things to try like changing WiFi channels on the router.  After nothing working they suggested I take the card out of the x16 slot and put it in an x4 or an x8 slot.  I had to remove an ethernet card to do it but it worked.After installation the card worked well with my Orbi WiFi6 router.  Speeds were very good and the connection stable.  The Bluetooth connection also worked well and the connection was quick and easy with no detectable latency while watching video.  The usable distance was also very good.Overall the installation was terrible the support was adequate and the performance is good.  Throw on a reasonable price and this is not a bad card.
5,I bought it in store. It has both capabilities WiFi as well as Bluetooth. Consistently getting above 100 Mbps without any drops. Bluetooth seems to be pretty smooth as well.
5,First some clarification of what this is since TP-Link isn't entirely forthright about it:This a PCIe card that is based on the Intel AX200 adapter. This is Intel's latest and greatest WiFi adapter and features:WiFi 6 support (802.11ax 802.11ac etc). This card supports the 802.11ax standard that is still being rolled out. That means that you'll be future-proofed for a while but at the same time it performs really well with existing wireless protocols. With a 802.11ax setup (which would include an 802.11ax broadcast router) you can get top end speeds even if you are on bleeding fast Gigabit Internet service.Bluetooth 5.0 supportThis card is compatible with Windows 10.Although the manufacturer says this card is not compatible with Linux in fact it IS compatible with Linux but you have to be running the very recent 5.1+ kernel. The manufacturer provides a CD with Intel drivers but they do NOT include the drivers for Linux (you'll have to download them from the Web).When you install this PCIe card and the drivers you'll see it in your OS identified as Intel AX200. On the PCIe card itself the Intel adapter is hidden by a red heatsink. The heatsink is mostly for show--the adapter doesn't run hot and doesn't really need a heatsink (and many cards based on the AX200 don't include one).Overall this is a very nice kit. You can install it in any PCIe lane (x1 or higher). It comes with two brackets in case you want to install it in a low profile computer. It also comes with a magnetized antenna that attaches to the side/top of your PC case. This is much preferable to the antennae that often come with these types of cards which stick out the back of your PC bump into your video cable etc. But if you would prefer to have the antennae sticking out of the back of your computer connected directly to the card you can do that too by not using the magnetic antenna part.Installation requires inserting the card in a PCIe slot attaching an internal USB cable from the card to your motherboard and booting up. (The USB cable is required for the Bluetooth; the cable is included; most motherboards have internal USB connectors but you should check yours to be sure. You only need USB 2.0 for the Bluetooth).The package also includes a CD-ROM that contains the Windows10 drivers. This is nice because the drivers for this card are not in the latest Windows 10 distribution so you will need them to install the card.A summary of the installation steps is provided at the end of the review for anyone who hasn't done this before:I installed the card in a HP Z420 workstation running Windows 10. This motherboard on this machine is based on the Intel C602 chipset. As mentioned Windows required the included driver for the card to be installed. (There's also a Bluetooth installer included on the CD).I tried installing this card under Linux but realized that I was running the 4.15 kernel and this card (being quite new) requires the Linux 5.1+ kernel. Since this is a production machine I didn't want to update the kernel. But this being an Intel card installation on a Linux distro with the proper kernel should be easy.I have 100Mbps/118Mbps Internet where I live (measured at the model/router when the cable comes in) and the card gets the full rated bandwidth both down and up (see photos). By contrast a Linksys USB WiFi stick (WUSB6300 rated as AC1200) only gets 80% of that in the same location with the same computer.On the whole I'm quite pleased with the card: It includes everything you need it installs easily it is recognized correctly and it performs perfectly. The included antenna is especially nice--it features a powerful magnet so that it can be attached to the side or top of your steel case and the antennae are detachable and can be connected directly to the card if you so wish.TP-Link has done a nice job with this kit.A+Installation instructions for the card:================================================================================1) Unplug your PC and remove the power cord.2) Open the case.3) Locate an open PCIe slot. This card only requires PCIe 1x so don't waste a higher rated slot unless you have to. But you can install the card in ANY PCIe slot that's open.4) Insert the card.5) Attach the included cable between the card and a USB connector on your motherboard.6) Close the case7) Attach the external antenna to the two screw ports on the back of the card.8) Attach your power cord back to the PC9) Boot up into Windows 1010) Log into Windows 1011) Insert the CD-ROM into  your CD-ROM drive12) If the CD-ROM doesn't auto-launch go to the CD-ROM icon on your computer open it and double click on the Autorun.exe program.13) You will be given the option to load either Ethernet or Bluetooth drivers. Pick Ethernet.14) The Ethernet drivers will be installed15) You will be prompted to reboot. Accept and reboot.16) Log in again.17) If the CD-ROM does not auto-launch open the CD-ROM and double-click on Autorun.exe18) Click on the option to install the Bluetooth driversAnd you're done. You should see the unknown devices in the device manager get assigned as shown in the pictures I've attached.
5,It's a very fast wifi 6 card. When the fast AC wife for desktops were first coming out they were really expensive. I've been pleasantly surprised that the AX (wifi 6) desktop cards have been affordable. You might as well buy this AX for just a little more than an AC card. Yes if you only have an AC router you'll still be working at AC speeds but you might as well future proof yourself.It was easy to install and it's really fast. You do have to open your computer and you have to know how to install a card in a pcie slot. The stand is really great. The antennas can screw directly into the card but the stand gives you more placement options where you get the best signal. (My computer's in a solid wood desk so I get better signal with the antennas on the desk.) Installing the driver is very easy. I downloaded the driver before I replaced the wifi card so I would have the latest drivers. You can use the included disc if your computer has a drive.I've had zero issues with this card. It's really fast. I trust the brand. I like it a lot and suggest it. I get a faster connection to my wifi 6 router but I probably don't notice a real-world upgrade because I already had a pretty fast AC card before this. I do have better latency but I don't really game so I can't tell you how much of a difference that makes.
1,This wireless card is terrible. It constantly drops connection forcing me to leave matches and be penalized in whatever game I'm playing. I've tried everything with this thing. It's making my PC the only device in my house that has connection issues.
4,Upgrading to this card gave my aging PC a nice boost in performance for both wifi and bluetooth.  My previous wireless card was an ASUS one which only supported wireless-N so several generations out of date.  For some reason I never upgraded the wifi card on my PC even though I got a new router last year so upgrading to this gave me a notable boost in performance as well as getting better signal strength.Also love that this has bluetooth built in I previously had a dongle bluetooth adapter on the PC and this one performs much better again improved signal strength and no dropouts.The only downsides to this wifi card are that the pigtail cables which connect the antenna may be short for some scenarios (if you don't want to place it right on top of your PC case or you have a very large one).  And also its a new chipset with drivers that may still have some kinks to work out.. they have released updates recently which fix the main issue I was having though (occasional wifi dropouts) so hopefully it remains stable.
5,So much faster and more reliable than the cheap USB adapter I was using.
5,First I have tested 4 AX200 implementations. With heatsink without heatsink and a various antennas. I found the biggest thing that differed between these was the antennas. Only the antennas showed improvements or were problems in some cases. I tried straight antenna setups which have the antenna behind the computer and two different base styles with one that almost solely works as a magnet on the side of the computer. Out of all the ones tested only This and the Fenvi tested well. Interestingly both had heatsinks. All of them worked well on bluetooth with great range. The best antenna's go to TP-Link and the Fenvi worked well but was a better option for a less conspicuous antenna solution. I would still prefer this over the alternative. I did test these antennas with the other alternatives and found that these antennas are the secret to better performance. I got better signal with the antennas provided here on all samples I had. I was getting 400 with Fenvi and lower for all other alternatives with the antenna behind the computer option getting 270. The antenna here I was able to get a stable 1.1 with 2.4 peaks and sometimes dropping below to 874 speeds. Latency was vastly improved as well and improved performance of the Steamlink I use in my house. Which requires a good latency or you will notice in button pushes.
5,I don't know how I was using my old wifi card this thing is not just double the speed or triple the speed. it's quintuple my old speed this PCIe WiFi Card is so fast that you're going to hate your self if you went back to not using it I was getting close to 30-50 Mbps now i'm getting close to 390Mbps that is insane!!Also I like that it got bluetooth it'a always a plus and it covers all my house literally can reach even the garage and installing it was very easy you'll just need some basic knowledge about PCs I'm guessing. However it's bulkier that a regular dongle but again with those speed differences that is nothing to worry about and it will require USB 2.0 port on the mother board also If you don't own a CD ROM like me because it's 2020 who still uses it so it will take you a while to find the drivers online in order for it to work properlyOverall it's a good quality WiFi Card with very fast speeds but in order to utilize those fast speeds you'll need to own a router that supports WiFi 6 also I love that the base of the antennas are magnetic which I can just stick on the side of the case. I highly recommend it
5,I bought it from a local store.It's much much better than any built-in wifi/bt antenna in motherboards. My Sony headphone works anywhere in my apartment. Like 30ft away plus several walls. Wifi is almost as fast as the cable. Nothing to complain about.
1,Honestly one of the worst pcie wifi cards I've used in a while. I decided to finally upgrade the one I have in my desktop and it obviously wasn't worth it.
5,I've been a fan of TP-Link WiFi cards for years.  For us they've always been more stable than cards we've used from other companies like Netgear or D-Link.The AX3000 brings Intel technology to bear.  It was easy to install in a PCI-E slot in an ATX motherboard and fit the computer case perfectly well.The included antenna gives you flexibility so you can get the best signal.After loading the included driver it was off to the races.  The card links to our router quickly and doesn't drop the signal or IP lease.  We're consistently getting rated speeds in a room upstairs and on the other side of a bathroom that has metal screening in the wall behind the tiles.  That's impressive.  Other cards have struggled up there.In all it was a cinch to install and has been giving us great results.The card will work as a Bluetooth radio too but we didn't install that functionality because we don't pair phones etc. with our desktop PC.  I have no doubt that it works well as a Bluetooth radio too.Highly recommended.
4,I've had it for two months and it's working fine so far. Using the drivers win10 pulled instead of what's on the disk. My wireless router is an old POS and it's only on wifi 4 and there's a lot of rf pollution here and I'm about 60 feet away with six walls between it and the antenna. Despite all the things holding it back I still get a consistent 200mbps. That's good enough for the games I play so it's good enough for me.Will update after a year with any notes on reliability if we all live that long.
5,Super easy to setup best WIFI antenna I have ever used. Max performance in a not so optimal location. These are just a few of the things that I love about this WIFI adapter.We recently upgraded our router to a model that uses WIFI 6 so with that we had a lot of devices that still used WIFI 5 including my gaming rig. Though a dedicated ethernet cord would be ideal the PC itself is not in an area that that would be feasible. So we just use the WIFI. With my old adapter even though I had good signal I could not get the full bandwidth of our router which is 200mb/s or about 25Mb/s at most I would see 12-13Mb/s with this new adapter I am getting the full 25Mb/s and the computer and antenna is in the same spot as the previous adapter.Installation was a breeze all in all it took me about 10 mins. If you're looking to upgrade or in need of an adapter that is future proof for a couple years I highly recommend this one.
1,Hard to find drivers that will work properly with it you can’t use the latest Wi-Fi drivers from Intel Cuz Intel does it carry the AX 3000 drivers
5,Install two units on two ROG systems with no issues. Installed the TP-Link provided drivers on one and just waited on the second system until Windows 10 64-bit worked its plug and play magic. In both cases the card goes live easily. Both systems did benefit from a network reset. Also the new WPA3 is available but required manual configuration to implement.By default the cards logged in using WPA2 for compatibility. The network mesh is comprised of all Google WiFi units with wifi6 AX functionality. As shown in the images the antennae’s can be attached directly to the card. In both instances each unit provisioned at 866.4 (1GHz over about 15 feet to the primary router.) Fantastic and worth the price. I didn’t need Tech Support to install and provision so this portion of the overall rating is irrelevant.As others have mentioned a power adapter cable is provided with this product which should connect to an internal USB 2.0 header.
5,I’ve used this for 2 builds and it works way better then I expected it. Definitely a great alternative to wired Ethernet connection and works just as well.
5,Using this with my custom build AMD 3600x AORUS B450 WIFI Pro (Disabled onboard wifi) 16gb ram build.Home internet: Fios 200/200Home distance from Router: 25ft with 2 wallsWifi Router: Fios G1100Speedtest: 250Down / 300UpOther Benefits: Wifi 6 has a whole slew of benefits mainly for multiple connections. I have 22 devices connected at any time: 3 computers 2 phones 1 tablet 4 smart TVs 3x Security Camera the rest smart bulbs etc.Wifi 6 is designed to better handle these multiple connections.i haven't had a single dropped connection and pages nearly load instantly for me. The included wifi antennaes help with better range than any USB connector out of the back of your PC. Would buy again.I've since upgraded my wifi router to the TPLink AX1500 Wifi 6 router.
5,My old wifi card ran at 30 to 40 Mbps.  I replaced it because it was going out.  This card is great it runs at 60 to 70 Mbps and things upload very fast compared to the old one.  The only shortfall is the wires for the extended antenna are too short. I wish they were at least 5 feet long. I haven't used the Bluetooth because I don't have an extra port to plug it into so I can't rate that.
5,We have a desktop computer in the basement with 802.11ac connection to a router in the family room on the first floor.  Speed test typically was around 60 Mbps downlink.Plugged this card in really did not have to install any drivers or make any configuration changes and speed test went up 10x to 600+ Mbps.Note that for this type of speedtest result to be the same for you requires:1.  Your internet speed from your service provider needs to have the appropriate speed tier2.  Your router needs to have the 802.11ax (WIFI6) capabilityIf you have the above then this card is for you!
5,My son's computer was getting awful signals in his room and I did everything but change out my wifi adapter.  Wish I had done that first.  I installed this into the PC and was able to move it back to the original location with little problem.  It was easy to install/setup which is always a plus.  Looks pretty cool too.  I know my son got all excited when I pulled that out of the box.  Just make sure your PC can support it before you buy.
5,I thought it was going to be difficult to install this because it requires a USB connection and I didn’t think I had one free.  However that turned out not to be a problem and the USB cable provided was long enough to connect to the motherboard connector.  I had misplaced the install disk but was able to find the drivers required on the ASUS website for it.  it updated my intel drivers for the card and every think worked fine. i was able to get 500 Mbps download speed.  So I am pleased.
5,Amazing product my download speed was average out about 23Mbps but after installing this now I’m in the 200sMbps. 100% would recommend.
5,I was kicked out of my dorm building due to coronavirus and was no longer able to use wired on my desktop for school work so needed a fast wireless adapter because my netgear ac1200 wifi adapter would give me crazy latency when gaming talking 999 ping so I needed a new adapter. Sure enough the TP link adapter crush netgear no more lagging out in games and most importantly gets 98% of wired speeds. Couldn't be happier just make sure you read the instructions for the driver and if you don't have a CD reader like me download the drivers from tp-link's website.
5,Completely uneventful install which is fantastic.  The antenna has a magentized base which makes it really easy to stick to areas to get a stronger signal as needed.  The antennas can't be placed directly on the card unfortunately so you're "stuck" with the external-only option but the cord can easily reach your desk or nearby surface.Install was super simple and it's performed flawlessly since I started using it.  It can pick up signal from a surprising distance and there's a noticeable uptick in speed.For the price can't beat it.
5,Easy to install & get connected to the internet.  Bluetooth connected to our sound bar with no problems.  I have seen speeds up to 866.7 Mbps but for the most part it's usually at 520.0 Mbps.  With over 10 things using WiFi in our house I'm impress with this product.
1,EDIT 10/26/21:I've had this card for a bit over a year and a half. About 8 months ago the Bluetooth stopped working. I tried driver updates and even reinstalling the card to no avail. I was disappointed and annoyed but dealt with it.  Now the whole card no longer works. The wi-fi started to intermittently disconnect for no apparent reason. Again driver updates did not help. Now wi-fi doesn't come up at all. I'm not even a heavy user of my computer.I'm really disappointed in the outcome of this card. I'm dropping my rating to one star as a result. AVOID.---Unlike some of the reviewers that have covered this Wi-fi adapter card I didn’t want it because it is capable of transmitting at super high speeds. In my case I needed an adapter that had good range and an external antenna. My previous antenna was a Chinese brand PCI-Express wifi card and it wasn’t any better than the USB thumb drive I’d been using up to that point. Both of those options didn’t work that well so when this AX wif-fi standard adapter with external antenna popped up in my Vine feed I had to try it.Truth be told my home internet speed is 25mbps far lower than what this thing is capable of.  But the speeds I was getting before were both inconsistent and lower than the expected speed capable with my internet connection and router. My computer was about 20 feet and one floor below the router and next to a cinder-block wall presenting an extra challenge to sending and receiving a strong signal. Weak signal and dropped signal were an occasional issue.With this adapter I’m getting consistent speeds at the top of my allotted speed and all the Wi-fi bars. It solved my problem so completely that not only is my connection utterly reliable now but I’m reliably downloading at peak speeds.Installation was what you might expect for a PCI Extress card. It installs into a free PCI-E 1X slot on a motherboard. It does require an open USB 2.0 header (the same type you’d plug your case’s front panel plugs into) on your motherboard as well presumably to allow for the use of the adapter’s Bluetooth functionality. The included external antenna has a cable with two antenna screws for the external twin dual band antennas. The cable ends screw into the adapter card in the back of your case. The cable reaches about 3 feet just long enough to attach the magnetic bottomed antenna to your case or on the surface of a desk.If the external antenna is too bulky or is in the way the two aerials on it can be screwed off and screwed into the adapter card itself. This gives it the versatility to be used both ways.This adapter does not come with an installation CD though given that it is not backwards compatible with older versions of Windows this is not that much of a surprise. The plug and play functionality of Windows 10 sees to it that the drivers are downloaded and installed automatically.Wifi is really solid with this adapter and the Bluetooth has solid range as well with me being able to maintain a connection wherever I happen to be on the floor my office is on. Changing rooms or even going up a floor hasn’t been a problem. With Bluetooth 5.0 this isn't that much of a surprise as the newer standard has better range and reception.Bottom Line:This is a great Wi-fi adapter. It has excellent range and reception for both wif-fi and Bluetooth. Installation is fairly easy and quick and it has the ability to be used with the external antenna or by attaching the aerials directly to the adapter.
5,Updated the Internet and Bluetooth access on my older desktop with this TP-Link card. The video and instructions were very useful to prep for the installation. No problems so far.The little CD did not seem to work in my drive but I was able to download the required files from the website. Did not need any live tech-support so I did not rate the Tech-support. Not sure if you include the video and hard copy instructions in Tech-support and that was very good and easy to understand.
5,This is a WiFi adaptor for desktops that have Windows 10 only (as of 2020). You add this to the PCI slot and the antennas are mobile -- so you can place it in a more strategic location for better connection.So far works perfect. Bluetooth is excellent and WiFi speed maxes out my service. Latency for gaming is around 60-70ms so decent overall.Nothing to complain about -- no dropped connections and very fast overall.
5,This is a fast card and has great coverage but its only fault is not its fault as there arent enough wifi6 products available yet to really take advantage.This however works amazing in my gaming pc with my mesh system. Good speed and range and setup is easy. Not a fan of the antennas but thats the price you pay to have speed. and good range.
5,WiFi 6 (aka 02.11ax) is quite new and offers faster throughput.  This adapter is a fairly cheap replacement for a dongle to offer you WiFi 6.  The trade-off (size vs. speed) is worth it for us.  But that’s JustMe.
1,When I first saw this on Amazon Vine I was pretty excited to try this out since the card is advertised to support both Wifi and bluetooth with one card. Currently I have a USB wifi dongle and another for bluetooth. It would have been nice to be able to free up some spaces.I say would have been nice because I found out that the PCIe card requires a internal USB cable wired to the motherboard to get it up and running. So I went ahead and opened up my case did a quick look around and realized that I don't have any free motherboard USB spots. They are taken up either by fans or my top USB controllers or something else.I figured I'd still give it a shot but then I realized that the drivers come on a CD. Well I haven't used a optical drive in almost eight years now. No big deal I decided to go to the website detailed in the instruction manual. I go to the link and the website informs me that link is wrong and brings me back to the main page. The website then asks me what language I want the website in when I selected "English" I got a error stating that this website was not avaible in my region even though I could see the website was in English.So I went ahead and used my ad blocker to "zap" the banner out of my way asking which language I wanted got to the drivers page and downloaded the driver package for this card. Well lo and behold I don't know why but the driver package only had the drivers for the bluetooth in the .RAR file.Okay FINE. Maybe windows will just pick the drivers up on it's own. I went ahead and pulled the cable for my top USBs on my desktop installed the card and booted up my system. Nothing was happening. It was like my desktop wasn't even acknowledging that the card was installed.Well this was pretty much my entire attempt at installing this card and getting it to run. I have a perfectly good USB Wifi dongle I can use that doesn't make me jump through hoops to get it working. Further what the hell is the deal with this card needing a internal USB anyways? All of the other PCIe cards I got in my system are powered on their own through the motherboard through the PCIe why does this Wifi card have to be special? And even if it absolutely needs it why can't they be like every other manufacturer and include a passthrough cable you can just plug in to a USB in the back of your desktop instead of directly to the motherboard?I am aware I can get splitters for those spots on my motherboard and at some point I may just pick one or two up. But at this time I feel no inclination to go out of my way and buy even more parts for a Wifi card that is so finicky to begin with.Other things I didn't like:CD drivers only. Why can't you just include the drivers on a 128MB USB thumb drive or something? This would have been less of a hassle if the website worked properly which it didn't. And even then the .RAR file only appeared to include the bluetooth drivers.The base of the antenna stand is magnetized as if the engineers wanted me to stick this on my computer case. Yeah not going to happen.
5,Was getting a weird "connected But no internet" message with my old WiFi card and ended up getting this for my birthday. I pay for gbps speeds and with thew old card I was getting 150 and lower. With this new card i'm having no issues and my internet speeds are way better. Would highly recommend.
5,Honestly incredible how powerful this is. I'm getting better speeds than a power line 2000mbs kit. If you're on the fence I'd jump onto this side it's an Absolute beast And will be for years to come
5,If you keep running into issues with Bluetooth not working when you power down your PC unless you disable/re-enable the card the issue probably isn't with the TX.  Check for Intel Proset Wireless Software delete it and restart your PC.  You shouldn't have any more issues after that.
5,Awesome product increased my download speed dramatically and I don’t lag at all anymore. Would highly recommend!
5,EASY TO INSTALL AND REALY BOOST UP MY PC SPEED AND PING IS DOWN
5,Best wifi adapter in 2020 strong signal and compatible with my x570 mobo
5,good through put
4,Good for long distance WIFI and Bluetooth connective.  This card replaced a n300 dongle and stock Bluetooth access.  Noticed a remarkable speed increase in both WIFI and Bluetooth connections.  The card was plug and play in Windows10 environment.  The reason for the 4 star rating is there other solutions that cost less.
2,This card when working is fantastic and really helps me get the most out of fiber internet speeds. BUT everytime I hard shut down my PC (shut down safely then turn of PSU and expell extra voltage usually to clean the inside) the Intel drivers disappear from my device manager. It's a pain to try to reinstall them because half the time when I do uninstall and reinstall the drivers they don't show up. The card is being read in the PCIe slot just fine in BIOS so it's not my slot.After trying to troubleshoot this issue for months now I'm switching to a new hopefully more stable card.
5,I really like this I have been using USB wifi adaptors on my desktop and was getting poor signals. With this I am able to move the ariels and just by doing that I got full signal strength!This was easy to install easy to configure and works impressively well. Very happy with the speed of it.
2,EDIT 3/4/20 - The speeds have remained consistently super fast but I'm annoyed that this won't automatically connect to my network anytime my PC has been started or rebooted. It has to be manually connected and after that the connection is good and strong. This has to be done every single day. I have tried reinstalling the Intel drivers from TP-LINK's website to no avail. So it's a great card but annoying when I forget every morining that this can't automatically connect the way every other device I own seems to be capable of.I have a Gigabyte B450 pro wifi and the signal has always been pretty good. We also have a Velop mesh router that does Wifi 6. The TP-Link installed in a PCI slot above my motherboard was detected immediately and I was up and running including installation in about five minutes.The antenna cord is super thick and the antenna base large and beefy. My computer is upstairs and the house is 3200 SQ ft. On my first speed test I pulled 650 MBs. Steam peaked at around 85 MB which blew me away. I installed a 20 gig game in around five minutes give or take.Wifi 6 still has a ways to go and I can't figure out how to make this card utilize 802.11ax but it's really fast. Mission accomplished.
2,I've had this for barely a month the first couple weeks were great huge improvement on my internet connection no issues was working great.And then suddenly over night it just started disconnecting every 10 - 15 minutes. I check the reviews and it seems more than just me are having this issue. I really am about to give up on finding a network card that works this is the second one i've bought and I just want a consistent connection.
1,Absolutely terrible. WIFI drivers crash my PC. It's literally the worst drivers I've ever seen. I install them and BAM my pc crashes. I boot up in safe mode and uninstall the drivers and bam my pc is fine.
5,Excellent! Drivers were included on CD disk or could be obtained online. There were two drivers one for Bluetooth and one for WiFi. Both work FLAWLESSLY. This replaced a previous setup that included a “gigabit” power line adapter. The speed difference is breathtaking.Installation was simple just a matter of having a spare PCIe slot and plugging this in then attaching the included Bluetooth connector to my usb 2.0 header.In terms of WiFi performance I found that this card transferred inter-network about 1.5x as fast as a TP-Link usb 3.0 dongle I was using previously. And ~10x as fast as my power line setup. The antenna stick to the top of my tower as it is metal and with a few zip ties it is a very clean add on.The Bluetooth is worry free which was not my experience with multiple usb dongles like Sabrent’s. I was able to connect my Xbox one controller to my HTPC with this card with no issues.I’m sure I could purchase a faster card that would better take advantage of my higher speed router but not in this price range. For a HTPC this couldn’t be better.
5,My PC is located at 2nd level and WiFi 5 router on 1st.  Also this PC doesn't have WiFi support built into Motherboard like one of my other computer.For sometime I pulled the Ethernet Cable over the wall to 2nd level but looked very ugly.Previously I got couple of external USB WiFi adapters but barely got even 10% of my full internet speed. Not only the poor speed WiFi used to get disconnected all time.Frustrated I was going through other options and saw this PCIe adapter. I decided to give it a try.Install took less than 15 mins including installing driver from CD.Post install ISP provided speed test through browser showed 100% of the speed even at 2nd level of my house and computer sitting in a corner. So I guess the issue was with the external USB adapters (one was from TP-Link itself) that I previously had which couldn't get  enough signal.Finally the WiFi connectivity nightmare is over.I would recommend to give this a try.
5,I have replaced my USB WIFI adapter that kept disconnecting and restarting itself frequently with this PCIe AX3000 Card  Installation was easy and straight forward (they provide you with step by step video if you need it)  dont forget to connect provided power cable to motherboard for Bluetooth if you plan to use it - without it it will not work  card itself is very small it sits next to my RTX 2070 Video Card and covers maybe 25% of air flow near the bottom so far didnt notice any temp spikes Bluetooth works great - devices connect just fine (headset headphones earphones controller) and range is decent  (I use antenna dual extension 10FT cable to position for best WIFI and Bluetooth reception and it makes big difference) also download latest drivers form TP-Link if for some reason they dont work for you try auto updating from ControlPanel/DeviceManager after using this daily for a month I didnt have a single drop on WIFI or Bluetooth signal strength also much better than cheap USB WIFI adapters.  Wish I bought this sooner.
1,WiFi connects without a hitch however the Bluetooth feature leaves much to be desired. The internal USB cable that comes with the device does not fit snug on the USB port and this cable is required for the Bluetooth feature to be utilized. (I requested a replacement straight from the company and the new one sent to me had the same issue). with all the tight fits that most of us have in our builds any slight bend of the cord will cause the USB cable to slower be removed from the port rendering the Bluetooth unavailable until the computer is opened up and the cable is reattached ( I currently have my cable held onto the port with a small rubber band to combat this. Not my idea of a sexy addition to my build). *Another important thing that i must mention is that once the Bluetooth is set up if the computer goes into sleep mode mode the Bluetooth device disconnects and the only way to get it connected again is to uninstall the driver as well as installed software and go through the install process. THIS MUST BE DONE EVERY TIME THE COMPUTER GOES INTO SLEEP. I have since discovering this turned off my auto sleep feature and just make sure to shut down my computer for long away periods.I would like to add that my correspondence with TP-link support was also frustrating. I was simply trying to start an RMA in an attempt to correct the problems I was experiencing and they did not make it a very smooth process. The highlight (sarcasm) was when they required that I pay for shipping for the replacement of the faulty product (when ALL I really needed was a new cable but they refused to send just that and required replacing the whole driver). When i expressed my disagreement with being responsible for shipping they said that I could pay for shipping and then contact them once I have received the replacement and they would refund my shipping ( I of course took a screenshot of this suggestion and promise to refund my shipping)Overall-USB cable needs to be redesigned to ACTUALLY hold on to the prongs that it plugs into-Driver software needs to be updated to not disconnect when computer sleeps-Support needs to make more practical and sensible choices when dealing with product issues
5,My room with main gaming computer is the farthest away from the router and I love to play COD that creates a problem and in comes with this WIFI card before that I use a USB WIFI antenna the speed is around 40-60 MBS max. With this card the speed now is around 100-120 MBS a huge improvement and the card is really easy to install. Took me less than 5 mins to install it from start to finish opening and closing the computer case was the most time consuming process. If your WIFI signal is in need of a boost get this you won't regret it
5,Serious speed increase! The unit looks stylish and really pops inside a see thru case. It was fairly easy to install. Make sure you have an available USB connection on your motherboard the one with 7 pins. Setup is also straight forward if you do not have a DVD drive on your computer I would download the drivers and such BEFORE disconnecting your old card or Ethernet connection. Once installed I noticed an immediate increase in speed. The next day I updated the drivers of my access point and noticed an even higher increase. Bluetooth also works great I was finally able to connect my x box controller. This card is most certainly worth the price of admission I will update this review as needed.
5,My onboard Intel network adapter doesn't have WiFi 6 so when I installed a new WiFi 6 Mesh network in my house I was getting a very inconsistent connection.... constantly dropping off.I added this for the WiFi 6 compatibility and I haven't had any dropped connections since.It was easy to install....plug in install drivers.  I like the color too it actually has some athstetics to it which looks good inside my custom build.
4,Replace a micro usb wifi dongle on Son's computer.  This one definitely improved the signal and the added bluetooth connectivity is a plus.  The signal and speeds are definitely much improved.  Paired this with TP Links AX50 router for WIFI6.  While the speeds are consistent and good (250Mb/s average on the 5ghz channel) are still well below the gigabit internet plan and average wired speeds of (800-900Mb/s).  Considering WIFI6 has a base speed capability of 1200Mb/s this would seem to be underperforming.  Overall happy with the purchase but does leave a little to be desired.
4,Overall this is a great card for wifi dramatically increased my possible speed over my old dying wireless card. I also love the larger than usual antennas that really help to increase the range of it.The only downside I've found is with the Bluetooth. It seems kind of buggy and inconsistent. Sometimes it will connect perfectly fine while other times it will just try to connect for a while and quit.  Not a big hit seeing as I didn't buy it for the bluetooth but it's definitely a bummer that it doesn't work consistently.
5,I've been working from home for a few months now. As the number of meetings increase I had to move my workspace setup to my basement so that I don't bother everyone else in the house. I couldn't route an ethernet cable to my basement so I had to rely on a wifi card on my desktop. I was receiving about 15~20 Mb/s when my wifi should be capable of almost 200 mb/s. My phone was getting about 120 mb/s in the basement so I decided to buy this wifi card to try it out. After installing it I'm seeing about 180 mb/s on my desktop and everything (youtube music emails) loaded a lot faster. The extended antennas definitely work well. Strongly recommended for those looking to get a better wifi card on a desktop PC.
5,If you have an older MOBO with slow built in wifi or an older card this is a must.Upgraded the home wifi to wifi 6 needed a card to support it.I get a great single and vastly improved speeds over the onboard wifi. Product is solid and the antennas don't sag or droop. I'm not using the cord I tested it it worked. I only used it for an hour just to try it out. I didn't get better speeds so fo me it wasn't helpful but if you need to get over/around an obstacle it would help.
5,This is an 802.11AX WIFI 6 3Gbps network card. I wish it was the 6Gbps card to match their newer router.  It has a very low latency which offers a quick response to data. Setup was a breeze I installed the included CD installed the card and updated the software. Windows 10 Home Build 19041.630 detected and started using the new card on reboot. This card has been working reliability for almost a month now.
5,This wireless card is an absolute BOSS. I live in an apartment where having my computer hardwired is not possible without running cables across the floor ( I'd be happy to but the Mrs. wont allow it). Other wireless AC adapters I have tried simply do not give me very reliable connection (50-70Mbps) at this point I was beginning to thing there was just too many walls between my pc and the router. I bought this bad boy as a last ditch effort and was blow away. I am now seeing speeds of 800Mbps with wifi 6. This is probably the best pcie wireless card you can buy. PERIOD
5,Needed a WiFi card because I wasn’t going to be able to have wired connection for a bit. Hooked up easy enough for someone with minor experience. Does use a USB slot on motherboard. Seems to have a stable connection no drops yet. 300+ Mbps down and 20 solid Mbps up.
5,The Wi-Fi card was very easy to install. I plugged it in and Window 10 installed it automatically. The only downside was that I was not able to used the bluetooth feature because I didn't have an extra slot on my motherboard to plug the usbf into. Before purchasing this card I was using a usb wifi antenna and I was getting around 250 mbps. With the new card I'm getting around 500 mbps.
5,After tinkering with I found that if you connect it with pcie x4 or x8 or x16 it won’t work at least it didn’t work for me. I tried with an old system with pcie x1 slot it works flawlessly. On my computer I couldn’t access it because my GPU blocks the pcie x1 slot. So I had to go to my bios and change a  x4 slot to x1 so it behave like a x1 pcie lane. See the pics for details.
5,I have used 3 different powerline adapters in the past to get internet to my desktop and when my last one broke like the others have I decided to get a wifi card. The install was easy but the card to me never felt like it sat in the pci slot enough but it ended up being fine. Got all the driver installed and the thing worked and it's a massive 4x boost over powerline but also getting the same spped as I would on my phone right next to the router or directly plugged into it. Even though I only get about a two bar signal my speeds are stable and over the rated speed of 200 mbs.
5,For my application I see 2x the speeds as my previous Wifi 5 connection. My only gripe is that this needs an internal USB connector for the Bluetooth to work and I did not have any extras. (I had to move my watercooler USB connection to external and thankfully I have an open air case so this was easy).
5,This was such an easy installation.  My 12 yrs old son built his own gaming computer about 3 months ago and was connected directly to the router.  After moving his system to another room his download speeds dropped to about 199-265 Mb/s.  This WIFI card arrived 24 hours after ordering and he was able to install it in about 15 mins.  After installing the updated drivers he now gets download speeds of about 680 - 720 Mb/s.  Part of the reason for this improvement is the antennas are higher up where the signal isn't blocked by furniture.  So far we are very satisfied with this WIFI Card.
4,BT 5 doesn't seem compatible with my headphones. Both pairs connect for audio but microphone support won't appear in the OS.Come to think of it my BT keyboard has been more finnicky lately as well. It just stops working and needs to be forgotten and paired again. Try doing that without a keyboard...a pain!
1,Quite a bit of setup doesn't work with a few computers as mine didn't have the right port to plug it into despite being absolutely basic and so it's pretty much useless unless I get down to some soldering AFTER I take apart the main board and move things around. So much for an easy fix.
5,This instantly raised my wifi performance by roughly 25% and I can feel the difference. Make sure you have a wifi 6 compatible router!
5,I was skeptical at first. But once I installed it onto my PC and installed the drivers I was in aw. My master Bedroom is on the 3rd floor and my router is on the 2nd floor dead in the middle of my house. My phone I Pad TVs all have very low signal when in my room but my PC gets all bars and high Mbps. Great product!
5,Wow this NIC is good if you actually let it breath make sure you have the drivers installed from the CD Disk as well and dont suffocate this poor NIC like I am i have like 2 GPUs in my PC and need to install the NIC with a PCI extender to the top mount so it will not overheat causing it to not connect as well. Overall great NIC and it will hopefully last the 4 years my USB dongle did. (really was faster speeds even if I kept updating my drivers for the old dongle)
5,After installing this card with ease it increased my internet speed to the maximum allotment from my ISP. Bluetooth is a bonus and you will not be disappointed with internet speed using this PCI-E card.
5,Very quality product. I have not had any problems so far. PCI Express expansion card is 10 times better than any bluetooth or wifi adapter on USB. Greatest speeds stability and quality. Highly recommend to everyone who seek to add wireless capabilities to their PC.
5,Wow. Welcome to a new era. WIFI 6 is light years better than AC and this is a very good adapter this far. I use multiple TP Link products and this one is good too. Rarely have any issue with TP Link. Highly recommend.
5,EZ to load both bluetooth and wireless card drivers with my trusty DVD drive.  Noticeable speed increase.  Very happy.  Included instructions were clear and nice packaging!  Feel good with the 2 year warranty.
5,I used to use an USB wifi adapter and I had to wait at least 30s for it to reconnect wifi after Windows turn on. This PCI wifi gets the wifi connection right after Windows turn on.My motherboard is AB350-Gaming 3 Gigabyte processor AMD RYZEN 7 1700
5,This thing is great. Easy install and adds WiFi 6 and Bluetooth. The download and upload speed have gone from 50-100 to 300-400.
5,Had to upgrade my Wi-Fi card since I now have 1gbs service. This device allows me to receive download speeds of 950 MBS cia WiFi!!
5,I made the mistake of buying a less expensive Ethernet card this was recommended by a techy friend of mine. Massive improvement on speed.
5,Fixed those Wi-Fi issues I had when I was using a cheap Wi-Fi ax combo card like this one from a Chinese brand
5,Total PC hobbyist noob here. If I can install it then anyone can. It almost doubled my wifi speed also allowing me to have a more consistent 5ghz connection. I have never bought an "after market" wifi card so I wasn't expecting it to work this well but I am pleasantly surprised. Would recommend.
5,easy to install even for non computer smart people. blazing speeds and a solid connection that doesn't drop
5,I have Spectrum internet with 400/25 mbps speed. Using a Netgear USB wifi and was pulling about 260mbps. With this I'm way past 400 consistently.
5,Super easy installation. Fast speed. Love the magnetic base to stick on the side of my desktop.
5,Went from a shaky 16 to 32 download to a steady 50+. Great card with amazing stability. I stay in the room on the opposite side of the house from the modem. Zero issues now ! Happy with my purchase Edit: I turned off advanced security from Comcast and got a 200 mb jump  for almost 700!
5,I'm shocked at how wonderfully this can pick up signal especially through a basement floor!  The set up was simple and was essentially plug and play!  Definitely recommend and well worth the money 10/10!
5,I like that I was getting better speeds than I was getting. Unfrankly I am not able to run a wire where my pc is at but this Wi-Fi adapter is like being on a wire. The only thing I don't like is how the antenna are on the top of pc.Before and After
5,I use this for Verizon FIos and it works well. I think it uses a Intel driver so i keep the Intel driver software installed.
5,Terrible wouldn’t connect caused my pc to restart constantly after I took it out
5,Don't ever use those stupid USB dongles.  I installed this and I now get 300Mb down/300Mb up all the way across my house on wifi.  Can't beat it.  Also it was super easy to install just plugged it into the motherboard and started up my computer.
5,easy to install get full wifi about 35 feet and through a wall from the router.
5,Great WiFi card. Love it
5,demasiado bueno este adaptador.. fue un cambio eeenoooorme. es demasiado bueno 100 por 100 recomendado.
5,Agarra todo el Internet  de mi compañía. Y tiene un Magneto lo puedo poner donde sea.
5,Amazing product drivers installed right away
5,Easy install. Ultra fast .High quality antenna and magnet .Love it !
5,love it
5,Ordered for my brother he's out in the country and he said I saved his life with this lol
5,Magnetic holder was nice.
4,The product page showed it supported Linux but all the packaging and documentation says Windows only.  I was at first disappointed when I couldn't get it to work but it was indeed the problem others encountered in that it requires a 5.1+ kernel and the Mint 19 version I was running had an old 4.5 kernel.  This is just on an extra desktop at the house so I went ahead and did an upgrade.  If you search 'mint kernel upgrade' you'll find a bunch of results with two main methods described.  The ukuu method was not available because apparently the developer has switched to a paid license model.  However the debian package install method downloading the four kernel files from the ubuntu site worked like a charm.  Took 5 minutes to install the 5.5 kernel and after a reboot the system recognized the card and wifi worked flawlessly with no further configuration necessary.
5,I installed this adapter into my HTPC to replace another WiFi card that I had recently received but that wasn't working out due to the positioning of the antenna's. Installation of this card took around 5 minutes; however due to me not reading the manual first.... I had to open the machine a second time to plug in the Bluetooth adapter.The bluetooth adapter runs on USB and takes up a USB header on your motherboard; personally this can be seen as a downside as you have to have an available USB header on your motherboard or you cannot use the Bluetooth adapter.However after plugging that cable in; the setup was painless and Windows installed the drivers automatically.Connecting to a wifi network was simple as it usually is and I moved the antennas around until the performance was to my liking.The main differentiator with this card is that the antennas sit in a base that you move around on your desk; allowing you to have optimal wifi signal that isn't blocked by your case as most other cards (including another one I recently tested) tend to be.The base itself is thick and has a pad that stuck to my entertainment center in a way that my kids cannot knock it down. This is a major plus as other cards I have used with a base in the past tend to be flimsy and easy to knock over.In the past week that this card has been installed it hasn't dropped one time and my kids haven't been able to move the base.If you are looking for a solid internal PCI-E wireless card; this is a great option. The support for Wifi 6 is also a nice touch although I am using simple Wireless N or Wireless AC here 5Ghz.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful! Thanks!
5,Initially had a UBIT it was garbage. This TPLink is worth the extra 10 bucks over the cheaper options. A must-have if you have a wifi 6 router.
5,I like how this product also includes Bluetooth.
5,Quick and easy installation and comes with nice entente attachment.
4,Easy to install...works well however where I was wired in and pushing 1200mbs now I'm only getting 500mbs...router is nearly around the corner so I'm thinking that's the max for this type.  Wish it got higher ping then that but it works well enough to not fret over
5,Note: My desktop is around 80-90ft from the Wi-Fi router in a different floor. Walls and doors as obstacles.I installed this card yesterday. Here are my results so far:- Wi-Fi connection BEFORE install: Ping 13-25ms Download 16-42 Mbps Upload 5-8.2 Mbps.- Wi-Fi connection AFTER install: Ping 3-14ms Download 110-135 Mbps Upload 3-5.95 Mbps.The numbers don't lie. Buying this was a great decision for me.The only disappointment is that my mother board does not have an available connector port for the Bluetooth cable. I don't plan to use it anyway but if you do I suggest checking your motherboard before buying this item.Note: Make sure you enable the Wi-Fi 2 (new one after install) on your system and use it instead of your regular card.
5,Swapped this in for my old wifi card that only supported 2.4gHz. This card slid into the PCIe slot without issue and secured easily to my case. The antenna extension is a bit overkill for my set up. But went from 20mbps to 140mbps which is great given congested airways of apartment living.
5,One thing I have to mention: Make sure you really have this thing plugged in. I mean really push it in there into the port. Even if it seems like it's really in there push it down a little bit harder. it's almost like how you have to seat RAM? BUT A LITTLE BIT GENTLER because it's not going to make a click sound. because you can't do this thing halfway. It has to be all the way in there or it's not even going to work. And follow the instructions!
5,Was really easy to install the antenna system even looks kind of cool (plus the magnetic base makes it easy to mount). Wifi signal is strong and big plus is the Wifi 6. Speeds are amazing and it's about 1-3 ms slower on Ping than an ethernet connection and internet speeds are maybe 5% slower than directly connecting to the router. Definitely worth the money if you have a Wifi 6 router or are planning to upgrade to one before you replace your Wifi Card.
5,I purchased this item due to the lack of Ethernet ports in my home and the fact my gaming PC did not have WiFi set up. I was initially worried about installing this device; I didn’t want to ruin my computer. Luckily it was very easy to install and works great! I’m able to game just as good as I work with my PC being hooked up. If you’re on the fence buy it it’s worth every penny!
3,I'm a big fan of TP Link/Kasa.  The Wi-Fi card works great and I was really looking forward to the Bluetooth.  The problem my computer doesn't have the USB plug on the motherboard to power the Bluetooth.  I was surprised by this having a newer Alienware computer.  They really should have more than one option to power the card.  I'm no computer building wiz so I'm sure there is a way just have not been able to find it yet.
5,Great Product !!!
4,Excellent product well thought out design except for two minor shortfalls.1) Cable from antenna/base to PC is very short.2) When installing you need to supply your own screw to hold it in.Other than that simple to use and quite amazing increase over the mini usb device I had before.UPDATE: After two weeks of operation it has decided that it wants to take a vacation every hour.Also the software provided on the cd has proven to be a source of malware
5,My computer ran at 2x the internet speed that it did with my old USB antenna plus moving it to the motherboard frees up a usb slot
5,Has better connection in my room than my phone  laptop and xbox combined never had problems and always has peak connection.
5,Very easy to install and hook up. You can use the cord or screw the antenna into the back.
5,Installed on my desktop computer that I run in my shop for CAD/CAM applications.  So far the added external antenna makes a big difference over models with no remote antenna.
5,Got this started looking for the latest drivers on the TP-Link site so Bluetooth 5.2 would work correctly.  Oddly the US site doesn't seem to have the drivers for the Ver. 2 board that I received - just the Ver. 1.Ended up having to do a Google search found them on a Romanian TP-Link site - but once downloaded they worked like a charm.This more than doubled my WiFi speed and Bluetooth works with no problem at all.Note:  I can't link just where you can get the updated drivers - you'll need to go digging yourself.  But if you're installing one of these you're probably used to digging for drivers and Google does a great job translating Romanian web pages to English.All in all - almost all 5 star ratings just one star off because the US site doesn't have the latest drivers.
4,The problem is the new Wi-Fi 6 is supposedly backwards compatible but I am finding out it is not that case.I have recently upgraded my mesh to the Eero Pro 6e and were experiencing constant network drops this card resolved the issue.It is faster and comes with a Bluetooth 5.0 connection to your USB input on the motherboard which is amazing!I am clocking speeds on Wi-Fi around 1.2gbps in midday use!The only issue is that the bluetooth keeps dropping on Win 11.it is fixed by running the troubleshooting to re enable it.
5,I’m on GB Fiber and get about 400 mbps up/down on this with not drops. It would be faster but Verizon’s router sucks at wifi. Still 400 up/down is plenty for everything even online gaming and streaming doesn’t get anywhere near that. Low latency as if plugged in directly with RJ45 Ethernet. I recommend for anyone who doesn’t want to run Cat5 particularly renters.
5,Excellent card.  Easy installation and setup.  My ISP just upgraded me to a much higher speed fiber internet modem so I needed to upgrade the wifi card in my PC to make the most of it.  I'm getting about 4 times faster internet speeds than I was with the old card after the modem upgrade and I'm seeing wifi speeds I should be seeing from the modem.
2,Drivers make this practically unusable with WIFI 6 Routers. Connection drops for a min every 10-15 and makes downloading and doing anything terrible.
5,Works like it should. Bulky yes. Expensive yes. Easy to install yes. Seems like its old by the size but ax is the newest from what i hear. Wifi and bluetooth capable with an antenna for each. Thank you for an excellent product.
5,It was very easy to install and only took me about 5 mins to get it in my computer. once installed I had a fantastic Wi-Fi speed and doesn't even feel like I'm on Wi-Fi. I am very pleased with this product but if anything happens soon after I will be back to update.
4,Bluethoth funciona super bien wifi aun no
5,Easy install works great. I use it to get internet from about 200ft away. That might be a bit far but it works ok.
5,Easy to install even for a novice. Can't rate tech support as I never needed it. Finds and holds signals no problem. Solid connections. Can't fault it. Nice looking enough through a glass panel too.Recommended.
5,I don't have a WiFI6 router yet but this adapter cranked up my speeds to almost 3x what I had before. Very happy with my purchase.
5,Really easy to plug into your motherboard. Then its connection is so strong I get the same connection wireless as I do wired. Plus the magnet makes it easy to place the antenna anywhere.
5,I like how easy it is to pop in and install everything.
5,Delevered on time great condition the install was as easy as it could be loaded the soft ware and wow! It works great. I have to use wifi where I live(RV park) the connection was poor but with this I get a good connection and was able to update my computer and do other things I needed to do.
5,So far this item works great for a specific purpose - if you don't already have WiFi built-in to your device or need a greater range as provided by an external device such as this one.
5,I love this pcie card the antenna is really good quality and I can grab a signal from my router where my phone cannot. the speed is amazing but that also depends on your motherboard. adding Bluetooth on a computer that didn't have it so you can connect your headphones or printer is a nice feature to have aswell.
5,Absolute win. Very stable and fast internet. I was actually choosing between this and the other cheaper brand (the Wise T...) with AX features. I bought the cheaper brand at first and was quite frustrated. Connection always dropping!. So I returned the trash and bought this one. A big difference! If this one is going to be a mess with in the next 30 days im going Asus! But so far so good!
5,The AX3000 was everything I needed  extremely powerful wifi 6 connectivity with which I was getting identical speed and ping to using a Ethernet cable. The magnetic base clamp is also really useful for sticking it onto your pc case.Would highly recommend if you want the best wifi performance at home
1,This dropped connection constantly (about every 10-15 minutes) and would only start working again if I reset the network adapter in windows.It's not the router - my other devices have no problems with disconnectingI tried reinstalling both TP link drivers (that haven't been updated for 6 months) in addition to letting Windows detect and install drivers - both had same problemI tried TP-Link support where I was number 1 in line immediately for 30 minutes before giving up.I looked for other reviews on Amazon and saw others were running into the same exact problem.Not worth the money and effort.
2,I've bought this card to get the full extended range of Bluetooth 5 to use it with my new Sony wh-1000xm3. The WIFI wasn't a concern for me since my router (Netgear R8000) is not an AX and my previous AC card was doing the job pretty well. So what can go wrong? The Bluetooth range is WAY inferior to a simple USB Bluetooth 4.0 dongle. I can't go to the toilet without losing the signal from my HTPC. On the other hand if I use my Samsung S10+ and leave it next to the computer I can go around the whole house without any glitch! Also the WIFI (which wasn't a problem so far) is less powerful (at least 8-9db) than my previous AC Wifi card on both frequencies. Still the coverage is good BUT I've paid good money for the best chipset available with external antennas and I get mediocre results. So back to the seller it goes and I'll stick with my 10$ dongle.
5,Bought a Ubit wifi card before this hoping it'd be good but it turned out to be total trash do not get a wifi card from those guys when TP-Link has you covered!
3,this looked like an awesome card  and i really do hope i can get it to workthe instruction say that you need an open USB'F' header I can only imagine they mean a USB2.0 header and they provide a cable for itas I have a newer motherboard that only has one USB 2.0 header that is currently powering the interface for my cooler master AIO  i am not able to plug it in right nowI will have to get a "NZXT USB EXPANSION HEADER ADAPTER"  to make this workmore wires and another power hook up
5,No me demoro mas de 5 minutos quitar el panel a mi PC e instalar la tarjeta. Funciono a la primera sin tener que instalar los drivers. Tengo una velocidad de 500mbps y estoy a una distancia de 5mts al router y la velocidad que obtengo son los 500mbps.De inmediato percibí una mayor velocidad vs el adaptador de wifi que tenia ademas tiene bluetooth 5 que no lo uso mucho pero es conveniente. Muy recomendable! Excelente producto!
1,I've had this adapter for about two weeks and its been a constant headache. Every 5-10 minutes the adapter will disconnect from the internet and wont reconnect unless windows network diagnostic is run and the adapter is reset. I have tried drivers from from tp link and the drivers from intel and none of them work. After doing some research I've found that many people are having issues with the wifi chip itself which is the Intel Wifi 6 AX200. This seems to be a driver issue that has been happening for months with no fix in sight from intel or TPlink. If you do not have a wifi 6 router I STRONGLY recommend not getting this adapter and saving yourself the headaches.
2,Straight to the point: The card specification states that: "speed up to 2402 Mbps (5 GHz) + 574 Mbps (2.4 GHz) "But that is totally false... this card does 101mb/s on 2.4ghz band and about 500-570mb/s at 5GHzI do have over 1gb/s of internet connection tested through LAN before installing the wireless card and at the moment the speed was at 980mb/s while the internet being used by many people. The testing on the wireless card was done without anybody using the network. Tried about 4 different drivers including the ones auto installed through windows update/device manager.The card does work and have a low response time btwn the rig and the router... so should not be that bad for gaming... in my case it was only 1ms above my LAN latency.if you need connection speed higher than 1gb/s stay away from this card... if your internet speed connection is lower than 600mb/s you will be golden.
4,Windows 10 PC occasionally freezes for no apparent reason since I started using this adaptor.  I spent several hours exploring the cause (along with a couple other people) and couldn't solve problem.  When I plug PC back with ethernet cable no freezes occur.  When I use PC with wifi disconnected no freezes occur. Remains to be seen if bug is part of Windows (of which there are many I realize)  or there is an unfixable glitch with the hardware itself.  Perhaps a fix or software update is coming...or maybe it isn't?Anyway this setup is only semi-temporary until office is remodelled and PC is hardwired back in.
5,Compre este producto porque la anterior adaptador USB que tenia se desconectaba cada rato y bueno empece a buscar un nuevo adaptador de wifi y encontré este.En mi caso yo no tengo un módem wifi 6 pero decidí comprarme este producto para tener bluetooth y que si llego a comprar un módem con wifi 6 poder aprovecharlo hablando sobre la instalación fue muy fácil la verdad al menos en mi caso la tarjeta de video me estorbaba para poder poner este producto en pcie de 1 por lo que lo termine poniendo en un pcie de 4 en mi motherboard.Cuando inicie windows me la detecto  al correr las pruebas de velocidad me detecto todo mi internet y aparte hice varias pruebas de ping en diferentes ratos para saber que tan estable era y obtener la latencia en todos los casos fue muy baja la verdad.En conclusión estoy muy feliz con este producto ya que tiene buena latencia y no se desconecta cada rato y aparte tiene bluetooth 5.
1,Item was dead upon installation.  Many similar comments on online forums.  What made me decide to return the product though and buy ASUS is that TP Link has the worst customer service of any company I have dealt with. Their chat is useless the reps have no knowledge about not only their products but of computers in general.  I spent hours on the phone and on their chat being shuffled from one rep to another and the only consistent information I received from them was that they were all equally untrained and of no help. Some could barely read the checklist that they so desperately cling too.  The ridiculous thing is it's just Intel guts placed on a PCIe card.
3,had a hard time finding a USB F on my motherboard (I didn't know u needed power other than power from the PCI slot.paired with AX4800 the speed on the AC1200 adapter was 100 mbps and 200-300 mbps with this AX adapter.Im easily getting 500mbps on WIFI with other devices.was expecting more a boost considering I have a WIFI 6 router and 1000mbps internet but Its too much of a hassle to open up PC to return it.
1,What can i say...i have an AX6000 router so i decided to pair my wifi 6 router with a wifi 6 card to theoretically maximize the speeds. I was left shocked my speeds were 1/3 to 1/2 of my current speeds on my AC USB ADAPTER with much weaker signal range.I tested it numerous times and couldn't figure out why it was happening perhaps a bad day with my internet i tried both 2.4ghz and 5ghz changed the position of the antenna reset my modem/router reconnected all the cables reset my computer started yelling at my computer you get my drift...gave up then i uninstalled and switched back to my AC USB adapter....voila back to blazing speeds. Was a bit annoyed that i had to install then uninstall and lose a panel back on my chassis..oh well.Bluetooth worked fine.I had 2 cards sent to me as well by amazon first one was open box i suspect whomever returned it had the same issue i had.Oh and don't forget to download the drivers prior to install because TP LINK doesn't give you a DVD or usb media with the driver..Could potentially be a driver or windows 10 issue but for the moment i definitely don't recommend as many people seem to be having the exact same issues.
5,Honestly this is the best wifi card I've ever had and it has Bluetooth so Ivan connect my Xbox controller without the adapter now!I had an archer TP6 and it wouldn't get more than 25ish mb/s (my internet is 500Down 500Up).With this card I am getting 350-400Down 300Up and I couldn't be happier.
5,This is a great product with Wifi and Bluetooth. If you have any problems just like I did with the bluetooth feel free to use the "Get Help" application built-in Windows 10. I saw some negative reviews regarding the driver out-of-date. and I was trying to overcome it. In my case it works fine. My Windows 10 system turns out having some corrupted files and I had to run a scan and clean it up with new Windows 10 updates. It works fine now and this is a good product in my opinion. The price could be lower though I believe it is worth $50 - $60. It only costs $10 if you buy a Bluetooth adaptor separately.
1,UPDATE:  AVOID THIS MODEL! New drivers were released for this wifi card but it made no difference. Motherboard BIOS is up-to-date etc. Only way to get the card to be detected and work again is to unplug my computer and hold the power button down for a few seconds and then plug it back in. Other users have experienced the same issue.After about 1 week of use my motherboard stopped detecting this card so my wifi would not connect. I tried resetting my power supply and it didn't work. Ultimately I had to open up my computer disconnect the card from the USB header wait a minute and reinstall it for it to be detected. Seems like a pretty big defect or driver issue.After getting wifi back through the above process I went looking for an updated driver - it turns out I had the latest so I left it alone. The card seemed to be working fine but after turning my computer off for the night and returning the next day it was back to square one and I had no wifi.Instead of going through the above process again I've since switched back to my previous wifi card and will wait a little while for new drivers to see if they fix the issue otherwise I'll RMA the card. This issue seems to have happened to other users as well so BUYER-BEWARE.I want to give it 5 stars because when it works it's fast and a significant upgrade from my previous wifi card. If new drivers are released for this card I'll test again and update my review if it fixes the problem.
5,I got this product within 3 days with ship I love that.Straight to the point it's easy to install on your computer yes you can find a way to install it easily on youtube.It has two signal terminals and you can place it anywhere in the room (just leaving it on the pc is fine).The internet speed was amazing I got a speed of 70mbps before buying it and my room was far from the router. But now I measure almost 400mbps with Bell fibe 500 packet.I also stream directly to youtube and play PUBG + Warzone + League of Legends with ping 25.Download speed 1 file is 35mb / sI am really happy with it - recommended
5,Siendo honestos no siento diferencia entre tener mi equipo conectado con cable Ethernet o con WiFi 5 (tengan cuidado de tener un modem que ofrezca 5 GHz).Su cobertura es muy buena la base de la antena es magnética por lo que me facilita ponerla a un costado de la mesa sin me afecte su funcionamiento.Llevo 2 semanas usándola de manera intensiva y nunca tuve un incremento en mi MS (ping) ni he sufrido desconexiones.
5,Wifi signal is great. My desktop and router are on 2 separate floors and Im still getting 100 Mbps. If you don't have a CD drive (like myself)  you'll just need to download the drivers from there website onto another device and transfer the files over. The Install process was very simple. I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing wifi or Bluetooth capabilities on their desktop.
5,Three Bluetooth headsets have been tried to answer a call and it's impossible to take the calls with the answer button of the devices. Tests are made with Mpow BH231A Mpow BH232A and Plantronics Voyager 4220 UC. The softphone used is 3CX on Windows 10. Seems like there is software barrier for the aswering fonction. Expect it to work with Avaya and Cisco softphones.There is a long range of Bluetooth connection with this wireless card.
4,My PC is a bit far from my router so gaming was a challenge.  This has definitely solved that problem.The only issue I have is that the Bluetooth requires a USB2.0 jumper on the motherboard to work.I don't have any free USB2.0 slots.  I have 4 free USB 3.0 slots.  Why not include a cable for USB 3.0?
5,This product came with only 4 parts: 2 antennae the optional receiver base and the card itself. Super easy to install and get up and running. My pc is currently at the opposite corner of the house from the router and the signal is very stable and speeds are not perfect for very good for the distance.The optional magnetized base is also a very nice touch as I can put it onto the side of my PC case out of sight and out of mind.
5,Installed quickly and easily the range of the Bluetooth is incredible I can now walk all the way from the top floor to the basement with headphones on without losing connection. I'm getting internet speeds I've never seen before.
5,USed this in my desktop for half a year now and its going strong. The bluetooth 5.0 is a lifesaver for those using wireless earbuds the range is much much improved compared to bluetooth 4.2
1,Adapter works great when it is working but driver shuts off every time the computer goes to sleep. You have to restart the computer to get it running again. Talked to support but that was unhelpful. I would suggest ensuring packaging is not too damaged while opening so you can make sure that you can return it if drivers fail. I made the mistake of throwing away the packaging and am now praying some driver update will solve the issue
5,Es mínima la diferencia a la velocidad que te proporciona el ethernet asi que me olvide  de cables  por otro lado mi pc no contaba  con bluethoot los materiales son de calidad vale mucho la pena.
5,Doesn't recognized by win 10 you should install drivers. None of my computers has a cd drive. Would be nice to have them on flash or sd card especially if they are not recognized by system. Other than that it works great.
5,Easy to install. You do need to find a USB header on your Motherboard however. So far performance is reliable. This is replacing a wired ethernet and I have not noticed the lower bandwidth in everyday workstation usage.  I havent used it in a gaming environment so no comments there.
5,Simple to install software loaded itself. Fast solid connection to my wifi. Great value. My internet speed is 250 and with the router a floor down and on the other side of the house I get a constant 220.
5,Like the external antenna very decent speed faster than any cards i ever had. Driver installation was seamless works great with Ryzen AMD CPU.Would buy it again. Keep in mind - it uses one internal USB connector.
5,Originally bought a cheap unit that ended up dying and causing all sorts of PC instability issues. I wish I would have spend the little extra for this card in the beginning. SUPER fast and rock solid stability.
5,It is much better then my last wifi card but it's also was a little hard getting the drivers on when I don't have a disk drive and had to use a seperate device with wifi to download the drivers onto my PC but it's amazing and I would recommend it if your having issues with your wifi card currently
5,Works great and the range is nice I was able to hear my music with my Bluetooth headphones outside of the house about 20 meters away. I also reach Max download speeds on WiFi
5,Acheté depuis plus d'un mois et j'aime beaucoup cette carte. Aucun ralentissement meme si le routeur WiFi se trouve sur un autre étage.
5,Great piece easy installation.  A few short drops intermittently when first installed but seems to have worked itself out after drivers were reinstalled.
5,Justo lo que necesitaba! Excelente señal fácil de instalar! Tiene un iman muy fuerte para asegurarlo a gabinete! El cable es corto maximo 30cm
5,Mon i7 28 MHz 24 Gb RAM WiFi obtient de meilleurs résultats que le portable i5 2.6GHz 8Gb RAM câble connecté au hub par un câble ethernet 6a
5,Pues todo me ha ido bien súper fácil de poner me gustó el esquema de colores las antenas se ven padres Bluetooth funciona WiFi 6 funciona. Excelente.
4,Produit très bon mais le 2.4gh va pas très bien mais le 5 gh est parfait Bluetooth fonctionne no 1
5,would buy again was nice to add into a mother board that didn't have wifi or bluetooth since xbox wireless controller adapters ( after Microsoft update ) stopped working this was the only alternative
5,This product was a life saver my wifi card was on its way out and this card has shown me I was missing out in some super fast game downloads
1,Very unreliable. Doesn't even get detected by the system. Poor driver support. Don't buy this product till the driver issue is resolved. Connection drops very frequently
4,Easy to install provided excellent Wi-Fi coverage for my wife's PC.
5,Fantastic card - bluetooth setup was mostly painless  and the wifi speeds are dramatically faster than my old wireless N card from 2014.DefinitelyReccomended!
2,I have this paired with a tp link archer ax50 ax3000 router. The wifi is half the speed of the intel ac card that was installed prior. My mouse constantly disconnects and reconnects to the Bluetooth. If you already have a decent ac card don’t waste your money.
5,Fantastic addition if you need Bluetooth for your PC
5,Other buyers are correct.. this is fast😁
1,Keep this in mind before you order it. Yes Windows 10 64 bit version ONLY.
5,Excelente diseño facil de instalar y buen desempeño.
5,I am super satisfied with this product.  Easy to install.  Incredible performance.  My wifi speed was 30ish Mbps and now it turns to 300+ Mbps.  Highly recommended!
5,Easy to install if you have any computer knowledge at all and worked immediately. A million times better than a USB adapter would recommend to friends and family
4,Getting 800 mbps which quite sufficient but not as fast as advertised.  Installed on a new i5 10th gen.
3,Not sure how this isn't amazing with it's separated base and high-end specs. Mostly using Ethernet anyways though so it does the job when needed.
5,El alcance en cuanto a bluetooth es increible y la velocidad wifi ni se diga de la más rápido que hay.
5,Works super well! It was a great addition with the Bluetooth if you have a USB adapter definitely think about upgrading to this! Really easy to install
5,All is well I appreciate it
5,Easy to install and configuration in a snap.No lagbetter than expectedI'm very glad!
5,Excelente
5,Parfait
5,The Bluetooth problem that has been bothering me for a long time has been resolved.The best!!!  The price is a bit of a problem.....
5,Parfait avec une réception hallucinante! Bluetooth transmet très loin et Wifi ultra rapide
4,So far so good. I've tested on many devices and works as advertised with no issues. No drop outs or noticable hiccups. Would recommend.
4,works fine get the drivers from intel for windows and it works perfect out of the box in fedora 32.
5,Easy install and great speeds  worth the money
5,Went from a 30 mbps download to 311 mbps
5,Muy buen aditamento facil de instalar..
5,esay to use and very fast!
2,Antes de comprar este producto asegúrate de tener un conector f-USB disponible en tu motherboard porque sólo conectándole un cable que viene incluido funcionará el bluetooth en mi caso con una TRX40pro-s de Asus no tuve modo de conectarlo y busqué mil formas para hacerlo funcionar al final en mi intento por pasarle corriente a como diera lugar terminé quemando la tarjeta al conectarla en unos pins que supongo tenían diferente voltaje a simple vista no se ve nada quemado pero desde entonces ya no la reconoce Windows la tiré a la basura funcionaba el WIFI desde un inicio pero lo compré principalmente por el bluetooth y fue una total tortura.Recomendación: Compren una tarjeta que no requiera de conexión adicional de corriente para el bluetooth es una tontería venderte algo así y yo no puse atención hasta que instalé el producto.  Vi en foros a muchos quejándose de esta conexión necesaria para hacer funcionar el bluetooth y ha otros tarjetas que no necesitan corriente adicional.
5,It has good speed on my 5ghz WiFi 6 network and the Bluetooth range covers my house. Can't ask for anything more besides maybe a lower price. The Bluetooth USB cable was just barely long enough to get around my GPU so maybe that could be just a touch longer.
5,good
5,Materiales de muy buena calidad fácil de instalar si se conecta a wifi 6 se pueden conectar hasta 5 diapositivos conexión estable y rápida.
5,Really easy to install
5,Muy buena tarjeta wifi maxima velocidad con mi isp 100mb simétricos la estabilidad esta bien baja juegos de steam a la maxima velocidad unos 9MB / s a 12MB / s que es lo máximo que puede mi conexión un juego de 6Gb en 10 minutos aproximadamente por el momento todo bien
5,Muy fácil de instalar y superó mis expectativas. Anteriormente utilizaba un adaptador USB de red para tener internet y aunque era barato la señal era instable y mi velocidad a lo máximo alcanzaba 20mbps. Con esta tarjeta subió a 100mbps (mi paquete de internet es de 100) básicamente como si hubiese conectado un cable ethernet a la PC.Hasta ahorita no he tenido fallas  sin embargo actualizaré mi comentario más adelante por si algo surge.
5,Plug and play. Receiving good wifi6 signal (both 2.4 and 5) and full bandwidth speeds with this. So far it's stable!
5,Windows 11 picked this up and got it working without the need to find any obscure drivers. Works well no drops in connection.
5,Plug and play. Receiving good wifi6 signal (both 2.4 and 5) and full bandwidth speeds with this. So far it's stable!
5,I bought this because my desktop's network card that is built in to the motherboard had super weak signal reception from my home wifi - usually below 60Mbps download speed. With this network card & antenna it was able to get ~700Mbps with connection to my Wifi and significantly improved my download speed.
4,Had issues with initial install Windows 10 couldn't start device. Only worked when I moved it to a different slot.No speed drop. Fantastic coverage.
5,Great product
5,This is the best wifi 6 card I have ever used! I routinely get 500Mbs download speed with the router 1 floor down from the room I'm using this in.Would strongly recommend!
3,Working well for WiFi but not perfect. I had some disconnect every few days (only on this computer never on my MacBook).Bluetooth not working for me as this card needs an internal USB port to power the Bluetooth dongle and there is no such port in my motherboard (Lenovo ThinkStation P500). I’m not an hardware expert but I guess there would be a way to power both the WiFi and the Bluetooth through the PCI Express port.I guess that’s what you get when you buy cheap hardware.
5,Breathes life into older computers with older built-in wi-fi cards. Uses an empty PCI-E x1 slot and performance is very good. Streams 4K video smoothly and does just fine for online gaming.
5,This saved me from a lot of trouble I had with my previous WISE TIGER Wi-Fi 6 Card. It works great with Shaw Bluecurve Gateway 2.0 router in WiFi 6 mode. It seems very stable and fast. I guess not all network cards are the same even though they use the same Intel AX200 chip.
5,Excellent upgrade from the external Alfa USB wifi adapter I was previously using in Ubuntu which is not well-supported in the current version. The only issue for me was the lack of free internal USB header for the Bluetooth connection which I solved by buying a splitter so that my existing built-in front panel USB ports remained viable. Simple!
5,Pros:- Great steady connection even for gaming- Steady signal through a floor and a half- External antenna for extra positioning options and potential to avoid interference- Good looks for a red accent in a black case or if you already have other red components- New drivers seem to have fixed issues mentioned in other reviewsCons:- Heat fin coloring is more of a pink than redI rent out a basement unit and the router is a floor and a half away (halfway up a stairwell) so connectivity has been a bit of a hassle since I moved in. I just built a new PC and tried a cheap USB adapter (TP-Link AC1300) and was very unsurprised when I had constant drops while playing games. So I turned to this instead and am extremely happy even with the pretty high price point.Despite being that far away from the router and my landlords having a pretty poor plan and wiring (using 2 old DSL cables to bring the internet to the router and 100 mps speeds) I have yet to have any serious drops or issues while playing games. I consistently get at least 70 mbps down 15 up (which isn't great but not the card's fault) and the connection stays very steady. The USB adapter would dip down to 8mbps at times for comparison. The external antenna mount is great as well as you can place the PC against a wall and not have the PC itself causing interference.I don't have much use for the Bluetooth capabilities but did connect the cable to a USB 2.0 port on my MB and connected my PS5 controller to test it and it seems to work fine. Didn't test range or anything as I don't have a Bluetooth headset but seems to be adequate if you're sitting at the PC.The only (minor) negative I can point out is the color of the heat fins. The pictures make it very hard to tell but they are more of a pink (looks like an anodized finish which can have a pinkish tint if you're familiar with that) while the PCB is a very vibrant red (picture to show the contrast). However since the heat fins are down when mounted this is a very small issue and probably won't be noticed by anyone but yourself while installing it.Lots of reviews mention issues with the drivers being incompatible with Win10 but there were drivers put out at the end of 2020 (Dec 17) and I used these and have had no issues with it connecting or dropping every power cycle like others have mentioned. It seems these new drivers have solved those issues at least for my setup. Simply downloaded the drivers using my cheap USB adapter installed this and it connected without any issues. So if you're looking into this currently you shouldn't have said issues with the new drivers.
5,Easy to install. Drivers were available inside windows 10 and update software available on their website.
3,I wanted to upgrade my Wi-Fi card and get a newer one so I tried this one but it turned out to be slower than my AC 88 Asus. That being said I know my router is AC 1200 or something like that so I know it's not the newest technology. Anyway I kept the card and put it in a different computer that I have hooked up to my TV for streaming.
5,Es una excelente tarjeta de red y de muy buena calidad se nota la robustez desde que la sacas de la caja. Tiene una gran alcance y muy altas velocidades en wifi 6. Es muy fácil de instalar pero si es necesario tener conocimientos técnicos básicos ya que el bluetooth necesita conectarse a un panel USB en la tarjeta madre para obtener energía y comunicación con la pc. Totalmente recomendada es de las mejores tarjetas de red de su tipo que se pueden conseguir y a un excelente precio.
1,also received a refurbished  product  (wasn't mentioned anywhere during the purchase) and it comes in a box with a strong smell of cigarettes smoke (must have been sitting somewhere for a while)
5,Hoping this review helps some people.  I was pretty nervous to pull the trigger on this purchase because of some of the reviews I read on here glad I didn't listen to the negative ones.  My old network card was about 12 years old.  My ISP I have about 250 mbps download.  If I'm wired through ethernet I get pretty close to that amount - about 220 or so.  My old network card I was getting about 30-40 mbps down 7/8 up.  Update was way overdue this card did so!  I now get consistently in my office (about two floors up from my router) 120 mbps down and about 10 up.  Four times improvement in download speed!!!!  Makes a huge difference!!  The install was not hard at all not sure what people were talking about in the negative reviews - maybe they fixed the latest drivers in the install.  It was basically plug and play.  Pop in CD - follow the prompts and you're off enjoying wifi 6 speeds!
5,Simple to install and set up. Speeds were amazingly fast! Awesome product
5,I wanted to add wifi to my current PC desktop and this combo of card + antenna provides very strong wifi signal with ergonomic antenna that has a magnetic stand so it's easy to set up.
5,AUG 15 2022Wifi hasn't disconnected on me once for the month that I've had it. Wifi speeds are steady but lower than if I had ethernet (go figure). Relatively mobile and magnetic base for the antenna so you can mount it in most places. So far 5 stars and the Amazon 1 month return guarantee on the open box beats BestBuy anyday. BestBuy would refuse to return it if the plastic shrinkwrap on the box was  even scratched.
5,Bonne sécurité
5,Got this for my 2008 Mac Pro which didn't have built-in wifi.  I run Windows 10 on it so I wasn't 100% sure this would work but install went okay the only trick I seemed to have to do was to disable the built-in ethernet device in device manager then after I restarted it recognized this device.  I couldn't find an easily accessible f_usb port for the BlueTooth power cable on my motherboard but that is expected given the machine I am using.  Probably should have looked into that before I bought this but I don't really need the BlueTooth right now.  I installed the wifi software only and this card works great for that.  The magnetic dongle is a cool feature so it doesn't get knocked over and on the other side of the house from the router I get full reception.
5,My desktop is located in an awkward wifi deadspot in the house.  This upgrade solved the problem - much better and more consistent signal now.  Happy to recommend it.
4,...speed stability reliability extended range.A friend bought a very cheap network adapter card ... and was getting  100 Mbits on a good hour  (out of 982 Mbits connection).  Many a time the basement location that was about 30 feet away from router  would not make a connection at all.  It averaged about 75 Mbits/sec.Enter this beauty  (love the red).  The installation did not go smoothly for us because we were expecting issues.  We did not realize the drivers installed themselves without the usual prompting or indicator  on win 10 boot from installation of hardware.  It took us awhile to realize  that we had to connect it as a new device to the network.  So subtract the woeful  user error  and you have instant and perfect installation.There is a 3 foot cable connecting to 2 -=5 DBi=- antenna on a very strong magnetic base.  adjusting the antenna  made no difference.  But moving it to close to the monitor to cause massive interference.The speed and stability was immediate ......460 Mbits/sec  !!  always on and connected  no drops.  My friend does not have a wifi 6 router yet.SO all this is in AC mode .... and i bet wifi 6 will be even better.Testing right beside the router...  the speed is 350-460 Mbits/secs.  So the PCI adapter  is grabbing all the speed it is provided without loss.I'm very impressed with this card! :)
5,No latency. Connected to weak wifi and made it work. Definitely recommend this product
