4,This telescope was easy to put together and put back into the box. It is a good compromise for a beginner telescope.  Being a shorter tripod it works well to on a table or bench. Bought for my soon-to-be 10 year old who is budding into the science of the stars.  It takes a bit to get accustomed to how it focuses but was able to see clearly through the lenses.  Arrived undamaged and with all accessories. Have not had a chance to try the wireless camera control.  Being for a child it's lightweight frame is handy.
4,This product was very easy to use and assemble. The magnification on this telescope are awesome! The only thing that could have been more explained is the magnifications lenses that come with it. But of additional lenses that are for sale as an add on to this telescope are cheap enough and totally worth the money! Would highly reccomend this telescope for a beginners telescope. Had a friend who is super into space and nasa who tested this telescope out and said if they would have known how good this was when they were getting into telescopes this would have been the one they would have gone with no doubt about it!!!
5,My granddaughter is 8 years old and suddenly became interested in science. I thought this would be a great gift for her and I was right. In addition I found pre-filled slides for her to use along with this product and the entire family has enjoyed this. I think it was a hit and started her thinking about what she wants to be when she grows up although she has plenty of time to change her mind
5,I received the product in 2-days with Amazon prime shipping. The telescope was easy to assemble. Came with easy to follow instructions. It is lightweight and portable. Great for taking on hikes and trips. I bought this for my 12 year old son and he has no issues when using it. We are able to look at the moon stars trees birds and some planets. It comes with 3 eyepieces finder scope and a moon mirror which makes looking at the moon beautiful. The phone adapter works well if you want to take pictures of what you’re viewing. Great product for the price. Would recommend for beginners.
5,Nice telescope to start a curious mind looking at the stars without spending a lot in case you only set it up once - which happened with my first daughter.  My youngest really likes how portable it is.  I think because it is easy to transport that she uses it more.  It does have a small tripod so make sure you have something to sit it on.  My car works fine.
5,Really easy to assemble and use. Great quality for the price. Have been enjoying this telescope every night since getting it. It has a phone mount and this is how the picture from my phone looked. I got shaky hands so it’s a little blurry but needless to say it looks awesome directly for the lens! Great product overall.
5,I was hesitant to purchase a new telescope because in the past they have been a huge pain to set up. However I was able to set this one up in a few minutes. The instructions were easy to follow. I also like that I can attach my cell phone to the telescope. As a parent- this keeps my kids from fighting over whose turn it is! I’d recommend this telescope.
4,Took a while to get use to handling it but once we did the kids loved we could see the moon and the craters on it!
5,Great for a starter telescope. Good amount of accessories included to make viewing the moon pretty decent. Expect what you pay for you aren’t going to be zooming in on distant planets or galaxies but you can get pretty decent views of the moons craters! Again great starter telescope!
5,When i originally bought this i wasn't expecting much . I know that you cant be cheap  on certain things and get what you pay for! I'll Be 100% honest i was very happy with this purchase and have suggested this specific item to a lot of friends! Of coarse you can get better and i will! When i do It be with Toyerbee! They have a great range of Telescopes and the Customer service is unforgettable  and true! Thanx to Toyerbee! Dan GauthierP.S. in took that pic from the app that comes with thye telescope for your phone!
5,I used your scope as a spotting zeroing scope for my hunting rifles  It performed excellently at 100-300 yds with cell phone attached to see points of impact.  Not star gazing but compared to like spotting scopes you saved me hundreds!
4,It's a good beginner's telescope For someone who does not know how to work a telescope Son loves it he thinks it's the best hes been asking for one for years and finally we got him 1 and he loves it
4,We bought it for something new to try on our date night and I must say it was a GREAT purchase! We have enjoyed it not only on our date nights but just about every night since. We are beginners and it's perfect for us. Easy to assemble and easy use. Also I have to mention customer service. They are the best. When our first telescope arrived the dew cover was not attached but it was still usable.  So I emailed them and let them know.  Sent pictures and I told them they could just send me the part if they wanted and I could put it on because it seemed pretty simple.  Well lo and behold a few days later I received a big box in the mail.  They had sent a whole new telescope. That's why the picture shows 2. And as you can see they are perfect!
5,Well I was really surprised by this telescope.  It was bought for a teenager and she is happy.  This telescope is helping her reinforce her goal of studying astronomy.  Excellent price-quality ratio.
5,This is a gift for my 7 year old grandson. It is his first telescope and Is perfect for beginners or someone with more experience.
5,Easy and quick to assemble and with more magnification capabilities than I expected for the price. Great for beginners.
5,Purchased for our niece’s 9th bday and she was thrilled about it! It was so fun seeing her so excited she opened it and put it together right away
4,Super easy to set up. Great for kids fun and portable! No complaints!
5,Bought this for my husband! It has been so fun to use and to look at the stars! Such a fun activity to do together. I like that it’s easy to store has attachments and easy to use.
5,Bought for my 10 year old. He loves it. He can keep it in his room with out it taking up to much space. Being able to take photos from my phone is awesome.
5,Great for clear night sky’s works good and easy to assemblewould recommend buying.
4,Alright let’s get the negative out of the way; the stand is short and not all other stands work with the telescope. However if you use a folding table and are in a seated position this isn’t a big deal.This is a telescope for beginners; meaning if you are looking to get into the hobby but are not 100% sure you will like astronomy. The reason this is great for beginners is it shows a lot of detail and is easy to use. It is great for getting out and camping as it is small enough that it can fight into most backpacks with other gear. Other then the short stand this telescope could be the start of a fun hobby for all ages.
4,This a perfect telescope to look at the Moon and far away places if you trying to a tríale see starts this ain’t it but it does what it describes and fun to take on camping trips.
5,bought it for 6 yr old birthday.  He says he loves it!!  that's all that matters
5,First time using a telescope I love using it
5,This was bought as a birthday gift for my 8 yr old daughter. She loves it!
5,This product was bought for my great-grand son for his 4th birthday in July 2022.He likes this product because he likes looking at the stars and the moon at night.He would utilize this item every day however sometimes time is limited.For the price it is a powerful telescope.  The whole family also enjoys it.
4,Great telescope for beginners
5,Easy to assemble
5,I bought this telescope for my 3 year old grandson.  The telescope was extremely easy to set up and use.  My grandson is able to use the telescope without any assistance from me.  He made it a point to use it nightly.
4,This was a birthday present for my 7 year Godson.  It's a great beginner telescope for little eyes.  Easy to assemble.  No tools needed.  Everything goes together easily.  Nice maps of the moon & planets included.
4,Overall 4 stars -The product came quickly and was sturdy and fairly easy to put together however we were unable to get it to work.  My husband and a few of his friends are pretty handy but still just couldn't get it operational.  I will say we requested a return and it was issued very quickly.
5,I did a lot of research on telescopes and I believe this telescope is the best bang for your buck! I got it as a birthday present for a 10 year old boy who loves space and learning. It took us less than 5 minutes to assemble and he was immediately able to figure it out and use it. He absolutely loved it and I was really impressed with the quality of the telescope. I highly recommend this telescope! It is a lot of fun and I was shocked how clear it show stars and the moon. You won't regret your purchase!
5,My daughter is 7 and loves this! It’s great for her and the assembly was very easy!
4,I'm just beginning to enjoy astronomy and for someone who doesn't know what they are doing this telescope is great it comes with several lenses to make viewing more enjoyable I would definitely recommend this telescope and the remote for taking pictures with your phone is an added benefit
5,My seven year old daughter requested a telescope for her birthday and was very satisfied with her present. It is easy to assemble and use.
5,We were able to see the Moon very clear EXCELENT product great value!
4,Is easy to assemble and that’s allbecause I can’t see any stars.
5,Great beginners telescope. My son loves it!
4,love this for my first telescope easy to use easy to assemble and better for moon gazing if you are in a place with a lot of light pollution which makes it harder to star gaze the phone holder for photography isn’t the best but with patience can get a nice shot for you.
5,I like that it was easy to assemble and lightweight. I thought the site was too small and had difficulty attaching to phone to take photos.
5,Honestly bought this for just something to do with my boyfriend on a weekend in and it surpassed my expectations! For the price the value and quality is great! Definitely recommend!
4,I bought this telescope especially for our cabin so we could look at the stars from an area without lights interfering.  It was super easy to assemble and very lightweight.  I wish the instructions were a little more detailed especially for beginners.  The attachment for a cell phone is great!
4,Great telescope easy setup  got for daughters bday and she loves it
5,I gave this telescope to my grandson for his 7th birthday.  He is a huge fan of space and rockets.  The telescope was easy to assemble and he got to viewing the moon and stars immediately.  I would highly recommend this product as a first telescope for a child.
4,Nice product for kids to begin with telescopes! In particular it is useful to train on focusing and resolution during the day time by looking to the objects quite far away. As for it's intended use i.e. the night ski you can clearly see the craters on the moon. At its highest resolution it is quite difficult to adjust the focus but day-light practice helps to navigate at night.
5,Go this as a gift for my sister-in-law as her and my daughter like to look at objects in the sky.  They like looking at the moon and other objects on clear nights.  They said this was quick to assemble.  They have used it a couple of times and really had a good time with it.  Said it is a good learner telescope.
5,I bought this for my 9 year old grandson. It was easy to assemble and use. He is able to use it himself but it was so much fun exploring with him. I would recommend it highly.
4,The item itself was in pretty good quality and size. It also came in faster than expected.
5,Great for kids and beginners
5,I bought this telescope for my nephew who loves everything space related. He uses the telescope almost every night. The telescope has a decent quality and you can get a great shots of moon’s surface. Overall very happy with the purchase and definitely recommend if you’re looking for a gift to surprise your little ones.
5,Bought this to peer at the night sky and was pleased to find the assembly instructions easy to follow. I’m still learning how to use the different magnifications but that’s on me - not the product. Would totally order again for myself and kids or as a gift for someone else. Wasn’t too pricey and we’re checking out the moon!
5,The telescope was easy to set up. For beginners it will take some getting used to and playing with the feel comfortable setting up the lenses to find the right level of magnification you are looking for. I had to place the telescope on a vibration absorbing shop pad I had  as it is a little sensitive to vibrations. For the price this is an excellent little telescope for stargazing and enjoying the moon's craters.
5,The telescope is easy to assemble and is great for kids. I bought this for my little brother so he look at the moon and we were able to see it clearly and in good detail.
5,Easy to use ! My 6years old son love this !Great To have for family night events:)
5,My son ordered this to take pictures of the moon.  He assembled it himself and figured out the phone attachment.  He is pleased with the quality of pictures he is getting.
5,Compact portable and easy to use telescope.We were looking for something that we can take with use camping or just to use on a clear night for our kids. This telescope checks all the boxes.
5,Bought this for my god son and he loves it. Would recommend for an adult or child.
5,Very easy to assemble came with step by step instructions for set up very clear viewing and kid friendly!! Absolutely recommend for first timers or project use.
5,This little telescope packs a big punch for beginners! I bought this as a gift for my husband and me and now we've developed quite a hobby of stargazing. This telescope was easy to put together and in just minutes we were looking at very crisp images of the moon and other.
5,This was a very nice telescope for my son as a beginner. Instructions were clear and concise and made assembly a breeze! This is a sturdy telescope not cheap or flimsy feeling! Small enough for tabletop but overall a nice size! We really are enjoying it. Took a little bit to learn to focus it but not was not a huge issue. We are very happy with our purchase! Nice product! Would recommend to any beginner stargazers!
5,Bought this telescope for my niece and she loves it.  Works great for the beginner  Very powerful as well!
5,This was fairly easy to assemble! Not only that but it just gave me a way to explore the sky a little more!
5,For $55 don't expect to see James Webb telescope type pictures. It's a beginner scope that will give enough of an introduction to play with and learn. It'd be nicer if the spotter scope was more accurate or if the magnification was better or if it had a taller tripod stand. But again it's still a great deal considering the cost.
4,It was hard to assemble because no manualProduct was questionable because there were no instructions. I have already submitted my concern and just got a letter requesting i submit another review. I would like  a refund or a manual. Right now it is not working properly.
5,I love the accessories with which it came and it's sturdy plastic. I do wish it was taller but you can always mount it on another tripod! Highly recommend!!
5,This telescope was incredibly easy to put together. It's proven itself to be durable as well. Great for an overall look or a closer more detailed appreciation of objects in the sky. It's definitely a steal at this price. With the instructions it was quite easy to figure out how to operate as well.
5,I bought for my 10 year old grandson. It’s easy to put together and use!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This product is very easy to assemble. Although there many be some ambiguity in the instructions it is easy to overcome. Installing and using your phone with the telescope may be a little confusing at first but after 10 minutes you’ll have it figured out. The quality of view is high especially for the price of this telescope! Overall this is a very good telescope for beginners and for its price a great choice if you want to get started with astronomy.
5,It's great for looking at the moon but it is a little fragile and some of the parts seems to work when they want.
5,Got this as a birthday gift for my son he loved it . Easy to put together
5,I'd say it's pretty tiny compared to the picture but it works fairly well and is pretty good with spotting stars we cant see with our bare eyes. I've used it with my family and have spotted many shooting stars that we cant see in just the sky and it's fun to see the little ones very excited to see all these new stars they didn't know were there. I good 10/10 if ids say.
5,Bought this telescope for my dad. It was easy to assemble and he enjoys every moment of it. He would prefer I taller Tripod for when he's outside looking at the sky.
5,I purchased this telescope to keep in my camper. I like how compact it is for that very reason. We own property in an international dark sky community so stargazing with it doesn't disappoint! It's easy for both myself and young sons to use. Being able to attach your phone is an added bonus. Great buy!!
5,We are very satisfied with our purchase of this telescope.  My family and I will be taking a camping trip out to Pennsylvania to see the stars in an area known as Dark Sky and we needed to get a telescope.  We are not major star gazers we just wanted something of a beginner sort that we could use to see the stars and this was our choice.  We could not be more happy!  Highly recommend!
5,Great beginner telescope
5,Really easy to assemble and use. Quick delivery. My kids really enjoy using it. Great for beginners.
4,My daughter loves it perfect for beginners and looking at the night sky
5,Great portable telescope we can use at home or pack up and take on vacation with us. Perfect birthday present for our 10 year old!
5,We purchased this for my 3 year old for her birthday. My husband assembled it in no time and the directions are clear very helpful. It has several different lenses to use which we haven’t tried them all but the one that we have in is very clear and you can find your target easily. My daughter loves being able to look at the stars airplanes and the moon. She’s still learning to close one eye at a time so I just hold my hand over one of her eyes while she looks with the other one. The telescope stays put and doesn’t move too easily. Great and affordable purchase!
4,We hooked up the telescope it all works good and then screws started to fall out and come to find out they are not even the right size. The screw is soo much smaller than the hole that it slides in and out and you can hear the teeth rub up against each other. Everything else seems ok besides the screws. I would like for you guys to replace all the screw for the correct size or tell me how I can return this with out the original packaging. I'd like to keep it but if nothing will happen with replacing items than I just want to return it and get something way better!
5,I bought this for my grandson and it has been used every night sense!  ! He loves it and he set it up himself and it was super easy. I would highly recommend this for all levels interested in looking into the sky!  Very satisfied customer
5,This telescope is perfect for beginners. Easy to maneuver and perfect for my son who has recently wanted to start looking at the stars. Instructions were easy to follow and it was easy to put together. my son loved it !
5,I bought this for my 5 year old grandson.  After putting it together which was relatively easy we spent quite a bit of time looking at objects far away which he became quite good at focusing in on mainly animals on the hill about 300-400 yards away.  As soon as his mother allows him to stay up later he and his father will look at the stars and moon.  Great purchase!
4,We tried using it once but couldn’t see anything. We waiting the summer to go at the park at night to see if it gonna work. By then I will write another review to confirm if it is easy to use
5,Purchase for my grandson. He loves it!! It is easy for him to use. I like the value!
5,Bought this as a gift and everyone loves it easy to use and everything you need to know is in the instructions. Great item
3,Cheap good for kids maybe
5,We bought this for our 7 year old son but everyone in the family uses it!  We really like it!  We've used it to look at the far away mountains from our house and the quality is great!  I also really like that you can attach a phone to it and take pictures or video.
5,The kids love the telescope They like to search the skies for all the stars they can see. You will need a stool or something to set it on because the tripod is low. The assembly was quick the set up took some skill but once you had it locked in it provided good entertainment.
5,Great telescope. I have used it every night when it's not cloudy to look at the stars and moon. Telescope is very portable and easy to use. It was a great price!
5,We are enjoying our telescope.  We use it as a family with our young kids and everyone is loving it.  Would recommend!
5,It works great comes with so many attachments can't believe for the price it is how well it works!
5,We are in the process of adopting an 11 year old boy who loves the stars.  We have use this telescope was a great beginner tool for him.  We have watch a meteor shower  watched the constellations and just had a great time to bond. This product was easy to put together and use.
4,I got this for my 7 year old daughter who loves space. The installation is quite easy. It’s a good product for the price. I just wish it would be a bit better quality plastic.
5,This was purchased as a birthday gift for my 10-year-old son he put it together his self. Immediately took it outside on our first clear night and he loved it. Directions very simple it's all numbered with pictures just follow along the numbers and it'll come together perfect
5,Ok
5,Purchased this telescope for our son's 11th birthday.  He is absolutley facinated with space and has been wanting one.  This telescope allows for him to look at the stars and the moon with ease and he is excited when we have a clear night to explore.  Extremely pleased with our purchase.
5,Purchased since our 3-year old that has recently become obsessed with all things space-related and using it has become a favorite pastime for the entire family.
5,This was purchased for our 7 year old grandson. It was easy to assemble. He really loves looking at the stars so he was excited when he opened this gift. Great beginner telescope but it is stronger than you think. Good for adults as well.
5,I loved how easy it was to setup but also the great array of different attachments the only thing that I couldn't get to work that well was the phone holder but everything else was great. Very happy with my product!
5,I got this for my little sister birthday and she loves it uses all the time when planets or moon are showing 🔭🌙⭐️✨🌠
4,This is a very good telescope for beginner usage. For the price I was not expecting much but it was easy to assemble quick to dismantle for storage and easy for my children to use. While not as powerful as some of the more expensive ones I was very impressed by the level of clarity it was able to provide while using it. I recommend it if looking for a cost effective easy to use scope.
5,I bought this Telescope for my son for christmas. He has always liked to look at the moon and stars. He loves it a lot. We use it almost every night that isn't too cold. It feels and looks like real good quality. It is easy to assemble and disassemble at will. The viewing quality is superb. Since it is a beginner scope dont expect far off objects but it will be good for viewing the big objects like the Moon Venus Jupiter Saturn and etc. The only thing I wish is that it had telescoping legs. Is that how it's made or did we get the wrong legs? It's a little funky trying to view through the longer bore lenses without them. But we make do with putting it on our patio table. Other than the legs I highly recommend this Telescope for any space viewing enthusiasts! You won't be disappointed.
5,We got for our son who is 5 but super into all things science. No one here is looking to discover new planets or solar systems-he is happy just looking at the moon and seeing bright spots that we know to be far off planets -we knew what we were buying and what it could do. Didn’t want to spend hundreds on a SUPER AMAZING telescope just yet until we knew it was something that really interested him.For the size the price and assembly I give it 5 stars. We do have to weigh it down with a ziplock bag of sand and you really have to be quick when focusing as it doesn’t have an automated adjuster thing (the world turns so with it you need to keep adjusting).Plus it looks really impressive. Quality is great!
5,bought this for my 9yo for Easter and he has used it almost every day! super easy to use and put together and I love the phone holding bracket to make viewing easy for those with glasses like myself. absolutely love it!
5,Excelente recomendado
5,I bought this for my husband for Father’s Day and he has used it every night! Great gift easy to assemble and is very clear to look though. I highly recommend this telescope.
5,Love the telescope! Very clear! Lightweight! Great product!
5,It's a great starter telescope. Very easy to put together and get started fast!
5,This is my first ever telescope purchase and honestly I had no clue what I was doing…It was easy enough to assemble but the instructions for “newbies” was not well enough explained.I was able to locate and focus on tons of things around my neighborhood (houses Christmas lights that were hung etc) however… when I tried actually “star-gazing” I found it near impossible to locate the actual star much less keep my hand steady enough to find it.We have yet to moon-gaze  but I think this is better used for “large” scenery rather than locate smaller stuff.None-the-less I am very impressed with the quality accessories that came included. I’m sure once I get the hang of it I will be a “pro” in no time.
5,Love this telescope! it's awesome. The quality is great and it is space saving as well. Great view of the moon with this telescope 🙂
5,Order was shipped fast.  Bought for 12 year old child.  They were able to assemble.  Can't wait to connect cellphone to the telescope and use it.
5,This telescope was bought for my 5 year old daughter and my husband to play around with LOL it is great! They can see moon and stars easy to move inside and out with its stand and set up. Was easy to put to together with instructions. Over all great product for our family and would recommend to buy
5,Really easy to use good quality and a fair price.
5,I really like it. The instructions really help on how to get started after that lots of fun.
5,It is a good telescope to start with and it is very easy to assemble.
5,Great starter telescope. Durable and works great. Easy to use. Glad I purchased.
5,Purchased for my 13 year old with special needs because he’s on a solid system kick right now and he LOVES it.  Easy for him to use alone or with adult supervision.  Didn’t want to get a “toy” telescope but also didn’t want to break the bank. This one was perfect
5,Honestly so easy to assemble and it works great! The view you capture on here is awesome! For beginners it’s easy to use!
5,I got this for my 11 year old son. He loves it! Easy to assemble and use.
5,This is a super cute first telescope. We bought it as a Kindergarten Graduation gift and gave it to our kids this past weekend
5,This is his 1st telescope that i bought him for his birthday. He loves it and we also used to see the lunar eclipse We didn't take a picture. we satisfied this products and also this company. arrived early before his birthday. Thank you so much!
5,It is good for beginners because it is not expensive and it contains everything that beginner needs. The kids could explore how to use from it.
5,We got this telescope for our son for Christmas. He loves to go out with me and look at the stars and planets so it was perfect for him. This is great for a beginner. It was easy to follow the instructions to assemble. Of course the first night we put it together it was super cloudy out but that gave us time to play around with it. Since then we have really enjoyed looking at the stars and moon. We love to encourage educational interests and he really enjoys being able to spend time using this to star gaze. We are very pleased with this purchase.
5,My kid had a blast using this telescope
5,My daughter loves to look at the moon with her telescope. It's really cool seeing Craters in the moon.
5,This telescope is a great addition to my classroom.  My students have enjoyed using it to find objects in our Las Vegas landscape.The legs were shorter than I thought but I placed it on a tabletop and it works like a charm.
4,The Telescope was delivered quickly assembly was easy and use was easy for my 11 yr old.
5,It introduced my grandson to what is well beyond our ability to experience with the naked eye. He is very excited!!
5,Amazing telescope for starters or kids wanting to look up at the night sky. Easy to assemble and fun to use.
5,Husband loves it and cost wise good
5,Wonderful product we got this for our 6 year old and he is amazed with it .
5,Happy with product. Son loves it!
5,I got this for Christmas and I love it. I’m 11 years old.I loved that when you looked at the moon or the stars it felt like you were so close to them and how cool it was to see different things that you wouldn’t see without the telescope. It is good for nighttime because even if you can’t see anything there is a night vision option that you can use to see better. But the only thing I didn’t like about it was that you couldn’t zoom in or out of the telescope but other then that I think it’s a good product.
5,My 2 boys love it. Easy to use
5,great product
5,It took some assembly but that was to be expected. When your 3 year old and 6 year old grandsons indicate an interest in the stars and planets you respond. This telescope is a great beginner unit. It allows the kids to enjoy the sky without grandpa worrying about them breaking an expensive instrument. It took some practice to zone in on an object and even more practice for little people to realize the optimum way to view that object through the lens but once they got the hang of if they had an incredible experience. Well worth the money.
5,6 year old twins birthday...it was a HIT!!
5,Great for when we go camping or on any clear night to check out the moon and stars
4,Very light weight.  Kids love it and have no problem hauling it around. Perfect size to set on a desk or a night stand. Can see the craters on the moon so it actually works.
5,We ordered this telescope for my son who just turned 6. It is perfect for him. He enjoys using it.
5,easy to assemble great introduction for beginner astrologist
5,This product was well worth the price. I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested in buying a telescope.
3,My grandson can’t wait until it is dark outside to use this telescope. He is young and just learning about space and telescopes and this is the perfect telescope for him. The tripod is short and needs to be put on a table but that is not a problem.
5,I bought it for my niece she loves it
5,I bought this for my 10 year old who is extremely interested in all things space. It is the perfect size for him and it was easy to assemble. It is durable and easy to switch from one eye piece to another. We love to use it out our window and outside to see different constellations. He said he feels like it unlocks the mysteries of space that he couldn’t see with his bare eyes :) I don’t mind it being out all the time too because it is really pretty and sophisticated looking!
5,One of the amazing product very easy to setup and to use.
5,Product was very fast to arrive. When it arrived I took it out of the package and assembled it after reading the manual. It will be great for our grandson who is 8. The assembly said it would take about 10 minutes to set up. That was a good number since I took my time to make sure I had everything correct. Overall it was very easy to assemble. I am guessing it would have taken a little longer if I had not familiarized myself with the parts first.Tried it out by looking at the moon. Worked great!I am sure he will love it Xmas morning.
5,Bought this for my grandson who is 8. Great product great price.
5,Easy to use I highly recommend this telescope if your a beginner
5,Telescope is amazing! My nephew really enjoys it. Perfect for family time together and for learning about planet and stars. Thank you so much. It was easy to set up and use. Hope to be able to buy more products from you. Great quality durable material. Great for all ages. Hope to get many years of fun and learning experience!! So in love with this. Grown ups have good experience with this.
5,I ordered this telescope for my daughter for Christmas! She ended up opening her gift Christmas eve and was so happy! The telescope is easy to assemble and user friendly.I spent maybe 3 min assembling and my daughter brought it outside to use and was appreciative of it.She was able to locate many stars and the moon.This is by far one of her favorite gifts!
5,I ordered this telescope for my 7 year old grandson. He has a 12 year old brother and they both love it. It was very easy to put together right out of the box. In fact the 12 year old had no trouble at all getting it set up for his brother. We have had cold weather so they haven't had too many chances to use it outside. We are all looking forward to warmer weather and clear nights so we can check it out.
5,it was a ez to use and good value
5,What I like about this product is the sturdiness of this telescope in its entirety.  Very solid construction good design & color too.  When the telescope arrived I was also impressed with how carefully and securely the telescope pieces had been packaged.  A very fair price $$ too.  I purchased this telescope for a family member who is also very impressed and happy with this product!
4,This telescope was easy to assemble and use. Even living in a densely populated city we were able to use and gaze at the night stars.
4,My kid loved it and was surprised as how clear he could see the moon and it’s features
5,My nephew has been so into stars and planets and I knew a telescope would be great. Kids grow out of toys so fast and lose interest but no interest lost with the telescope yet. He is 9 and actually assembled it on his own with no help. He was scoping out the sky (not the sun) as soon as he opened and assembled it. If anyone is looking for a telescope that has great beginners quality I definitely recommend this product.
5,This was a great telescope for my 8-year old. In fact everyone in the house uses it. It's good quality at a reasonable price. It fits perfectly in our living room and doesn't take up too much space. We used this during the last full moon and the kids were amazing. It offered clear pictures and great zooming. I would definitely recommend this. It's a great family telescope but also makes an awesome present for a budding astronomer.
5,We got this telescope for my 6 year old’s birthday. It did not take too long to assemble and has been great for some beginner stargazing! He is interested in looking at the moon and seeing stars a little more close up. This is perfect for that. The phone holder was a nice bonus!
5,I was on the market for an affordable easy to use microscope for my 12 year old son & that is what I found in this product. Instructions for assembly were easy to read and follow. 2 posters are given within the purchase. The stand is short however placing it on top of our grill or table worked out perfectly for a sitting down experience while we all gazed above.The microscope is easy to use. Light enough for everyone to enjoy. We have not used the phone feature but I'm sure we won't be disappointed.
5,A GREAT PURCHASE AND REALLY WORKS
5,Liked it
5,I purchased this for my grandson and he does enjoy it but we enjoy looking as well.  It’s very clear to look thru  I would definitely recommend it.
5,This was very easy to put together. Good description of how to identify things and focus in on them. Start with the least magnitude to get comfortable with how minimal movement is required to focus on anything. Then increase until you have a good feel for it. Like all telescopes...
5,She loves it❤️And its perfect for a beginners.  it was easy to use and assemble 👍🏻 The lenses are so clear . She’s having too much fun with it
5,I ordered this telescope for my nine year old granddaughter. I was surprised to see her how excited she was when she opened her gift. But often gifts like this get put aside and never used. The next time I was at her house I noticed she had her telescope set up by her bedroom window and was using it in the evenings to view stars. I think this is a wonderful gift for children as it teaches them astronomy.
5,My husband asked me for a telescope for christmas.He is so happy with thiw gift we have shared some moments seeing the moon and a few planets.And by the way a excellent customer service they made me a letter to follow up asking if we were happy with the product our feedback experience and if there was anything they can help us with.Thanks for care :)
5,I love the fact that you can see every crater on the moon during the day and the set up is very simple and only took like 10 minutes to get it together and get a clear view. The only downside is the legs are short so you need to set it on a stand of some sort. Just maybe a suggestion is to add a carrying case of some sort for it to travel and store.
5,This little telescope packs a big punch for beginners! I bought this as a gift for my husband and me and now we've developed quite a hobby of stargazing. This telescope was easy to put together and in just minutes we were looking at very crisp images of the moon and other star alignments. We loved how we can attach our phones to take pictures too. I would recommend this to anyone interested in astronomy at any age.
5,My 11 year old granddaughter loves it
5,My son was more excited about it than my grandson for whom i purchased it. He put it together very easily. We have not been able to use it to it's full capability due to the weather being so poor but we have been able to catch the 1/4 moon. We also used it during the day to see the lovely Catskill Mountains. Very happy for the price.
5,Muy satisfecha con esta compra. Mi hija que es amante de la astronomía quedo encantada es fácil de manejar para los niños y resistente. Su mejor regalo ha sido este.
5,This is very cute. It’s short so needs to be on a table or can be in the floor. It was easy to assemble. My kids are really enjoying it and were so excited when they could see the moon and many other things. Great teaching tool.
5,My school-aged daughter has recently discovered a great love for science. She has a passion for STEAM classes and asked for a telescope for Christmas. She was thrilled to get this and she loves it! Easy to assemble good size for small spaces and she's been using it every night since we set it up. A wonderful instrument to encourage her in a subject that young girls are often discouraged to study.
5,Bought for my child looks cool.
5,Good product for the price
5,Easy to set up awesome lenses kids love it we live in the mountains and every night they wanna use it to look at the stars.
4,Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it?  Great for children or beginners.
5,We ordered this telescope for Christmas for our nine year old daughter. The package arrived in great condition and on time. The telescope was easy to assemble and seems to be built solidly. The smartphone attachment is a great feature. Our daughter was very happy to receive this as a gift. We look forward to using it more in the warmer months this summer.
4,I have trouble getting my phone lined up perfectly. But it's probably user error.
5,I bought it for my 8 year old and we all love it! Super easy to put together and we’re able to see the moon and stars extremely well
5,We purchased this in December and was for a gift. Assembly was easy had thorough instructions and looked great when assembled. My son uses it to look at birds during the day and at night he loves looking at the moon. Great value and great telescope.
2,Do not buy this mine came with a spider and web inside reflector and I had broken equipment but the spider was enough for me. It’s not like it’s cheap cheap like it should be in better condition and not come with an unwanted pet!! NOPE!! Do not buy
4,This product is great for kids or beginner enthusiast
5,This is an absolutely amazing find. My son has been obsessed with space and loved putting together his own telescope!
5,My kids loved this as a gift this year. It was easy to assemble and works VERY well even compared to the much higher priced telescopes. The phone attachment is a plus as they can take pictures and show their friends at school the stars and thing they observed the night before. Highly recommend this item. Looking to possibly get another for my deck.
5,This product was very easy to assemble which was perfect for the timing of the gift to my daughter during the holidays.  It can look complicated with the different pieces and levers but she quickly picked up how to maneuver the telescope and we were viewing the moon that night.This fits the bill exactly as advertised and we love it!
5,i  liked how far it zoomed in but it was small and hard to find things kind of
4,Good price good quality and good gift
5,My daughter loved this telescope. We purchased it for her birthday. It wasn’t difficult to learn.
5,I got this for my husband to bring back childhood memories with his grandfather. It did the job well and there was no complicated set up. He enjoyed it and it brought a smile to his face. The only small critique would be I wish the pod legs extended out.  Thank you for a great sentimental gift for the hubba I recommend.
5,Nice beginner telescope. Purchased it for my grandkids as a Christmas gift. Love the feature of being able to attach your phone to take pictures. It was easy to assemble. The tripod is short but it was to be expected from the description but it was a standard fit and was able to use our camera tripod when not on a table top.
5,This telescope helped my 6 year old grandson understand that the moon is real and not what it says on the storybooks. Easy to asemble and use. Now I'll be looking for a much bigger one for myself.
5,Our Son is Ten and wanted a telescope. When he opened it he started putting it together by himself. I was really surprised he didn’t ask for help.  Pretty simple to do.  Two things I would improve are the explanation of the additional pieces more clearly.  Also the Tripod is very short I would consider adding a a taller collapsible tripod for watching outside.
4,This was a gift snd recipient was very pleased
5,Very easy to assemble. Great value for the price. Great product to get started with.
5,We gifted this to our daughter for Christmas. She was so excited!It was a little difficult to put together and I don’t think we ever really figured out 100% how to use it to its full..she still loves it and shows it off to all of her friends.Would recommend purchasing
5,This was purchased for my grandson who is 11. He and I spend a lot of time in the summer stargazing.  Putting it together was very simple.  We have had limited use for it due to winter but what we have seen of the moon is terrific.  A great tool for the young astronomer!
5,I love that it was so easy to put together. We got it for our 6 year old son and he got so excited when he was able to use it to look at the moon. Even the phone holder is a great touch. Also he loves the posters of the moon sun and planets that came with it.
5,The product didn't come with much for instructions but it's pretty straightforward on how you put it together. This was a gift and the giftee is very happy with it. The image is clear though we haven't used it to look at space yet. I'm excited to see what all shows up as we use it. Thank you Toyerbee!
5,I bought this for my 11 year old son. We are both big into space and it has been so much fun teaching him to use this. I especially love the ability to connect a smart phone to it and take pictures with included Bluetooth remote . He has been so excited to share these pictures with his classmates.
4,Easy to put together and use!
5,Good price and a great gift for kids!
5,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas she is 7 years old. She loves looking at the stars and wanted a telescope. She loved this one its nice and small for kids to use but offers great image quality especially for the price. Shipped fast and came in time for Christmas. Very satisfied with the product.
5,I have not always been pleased with third-party vendors on Facebook but this time I was very pleased.  The telescope arrived in a reasonable amount of time which was my biggest concern given that it was purchased as a Christmas gift.  The 9-year-old girl for which it was purchased was very excited to open it!
5,So far our experience with this item has been pretty good! We haven’t had a ton of clear nights to try it out but the nights we have we have been happy. It took a bit to get the hang of it and we wish the telescope legs were longer but something to just get used to!
5,I bought this for my teenage daughter as a birthday gift and she absolutely loves it! The instructions were simple and it was easy to put together. Very happy with this purchase!
4,My kid loves it
5,Our grandson is interested in space.  Great if you can't spend a bunch of money but want to get kids engaged. I can see him using this with his sister.
5,Wonderful telescope great purchase high quality
5,I loved it! It was easy to use and was great!!!
2,I could not get it to focus and I’ve had telescopes before that I had no problem with and the tripod is so small and the base is so narrow that any phone attached to the scope will easily make it fall over
5,I ordered this telescope for my son for Christmas. The shipping was fast and the telescope was easy to assemble. We've used it a few times and the image is clear. When we received the telescope it was missing the moon filter but the company fixed that issue in no time!
5,Bought it for my daughter for Christmas.  It allows her to take pics of the moon and stars up close using her phone.  The pics are amazing and so perfect it is like the moon and stars are right in front of you.  Also fast discreet shipping.
5,I bought this for my son to look at the moon and stars. He loves it and I also enjoy it myself. Great product for the price.
5,We bought this for our 4 year old for Christmas who is obsessed with the moon obviously in the Midwest it's to cold to go outside to use at night but does work well to look at wildlife out the windows . Easy to use super easy to build
5,This is an excellent telescope. My grandson absolutely was thrilled to open this on Christmas. His first reaction was “I can view stars the moon and maybe even a black hole!” He’s 5 years old and ecstatic. It was easy to assemble and easy to use. Very satisfied with this gift.
5,I bought this telescope for my nephew who asking for one for months.  He absolutely loves it!  His parents do too!  This is a great NON-TOY telescope for beginners although there needs to be some adult intervention to put together.  Very happy with my purchase!!
5,Very good product
5,I got this product for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he loves it. He’s kind of a little nerd so every fascinating information amazes him. He loves using the telescope to look at the stars and we even watch them together. Love this product !
5,Item shipped fast and was easy to assemble. Great for beginners very fun way to spend an evening and great way to get amazing pictures at night!
5,I ordered this for my grandsons ages 5 & 8 for Christmas. I wasnt real sure how they would feel about itWell They LOVE IT!It has a nice view and is easy to control. Everything about it fit perfectly for themThis was a win for Grammy
5,I got this as a Christmas gift for my significant other to replace the one that broke on him when he was a kid. It's so easy to put together and use the phone feature is fantastic! I definitely recommend this model for any beginners to astrology.
5,We purchased this as a gift for our nephew who is very happy with it.
5,I gave this telescope as a gift to my 10 year old (going on 30) niece who is becoming an avid scientist. She is thrilled with the telescope.  Her family has an ocean going boat and she has been using it at sea and at home.
5,Bought this as a Christmas present for our nephew.  Of course it is perfect for bringing him and his parents together in exploring the universe!  Paired it with a poster of the night sky on the night of his birth.
5,we bought two of these telescopes because our great grandsons wanted a telescope.  They are ages 7 and 4.  Both are able to use and enjoy.  I haven't seen either of them more excited to receive a gift than they were about the telescope!
5,Easy to set up and get started. Kids put it all together and were using right away.  The stand is small so will need to be on a table or will need to buy a different stand.  Other than that was a great buy.
5,I bought this for my 8 year old son. Not only did he love it but it was perfect for the entire family to enjoy. He assembled it himself and couldn’t wait until nighttime to look at the stars and moon!!  I highly recommend this telescope!
5,Our kids are starting to learn about space and this was a great way to share in that experience with them. It's small enough for them to use but still big enough for them to use when they get older. The stars are crystal clear and the kids loved looking at the moon.
5,I brought this for my 12 yr old son he loves planets stars everything we go outside at night and see what we can find in the sky I have learned a lot from him
5,I bought this as a family Christmas gift for my grandsons (ages 8 and 12)  and their parents. They have enjoyed finding planets with ease every time they have used it. I do recommend as a great telescope for young astronomers.
2,Not sure if it's me or the item but I can't see much of anything. The moon under the microscope looks like I took a picture with my phone then zoomed into the pic. I can't see other celestial bodies any clearer or more than I do with my naked eye. My recommendations for the equipment are to have much longer adjustable legs on the tripod a visual on the box or in the manual for a realistic representation of what could/should be seen with and without the various lens combinations and possibly allow for the telescope on the tripod to adjust as far as viewing directly vertical up.
5,It was easy to assemble my ten year old loves it.. even me and my husband enjoyed it during the metoroshower this passed week we watched it from the phone it was really fun.. highly suggested if your or your kids instered in stuff like this
5,Great Telescope and portable! Fits on a TV Tray so we can set it up and carry it anywhere! Quality of the pieces are very well made.
5,I bought this telescope for my 11 year old nephew as a gift. He loves it! It was easy to put together great quality and super fun to use. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that is interested in science and astrology!
3,Pretty good starter telescope but the phone attachment is worthless. A tiny piece of plastic on the phone grip necessary for attaching the phone to the telescope just snapped off during assembly. Really disappointed about that. Also invest in defogging lense wipes if in humid climates.
5,We bought this for our 7 yr old daughter.  She has been begging for a telescope so she can look at the moon.  We didn’t want anything huge that would take up a lot of space.  So this little gem is perfect.  Can’t wait to see her face on Christmas morning.
5,I purchased this for my 8 year old grandson. It was very easy to put together and he loved being able to search the skies. Would definitely buy a book with this to help beginners identify objects.  Would highly recommend it!
5,This is great for a child to operate and has great quality to see the stars up close at night
5,My eight years old grandson loves his telescope!!!  He looks in the sky every night to see what he can find next!!!Pattie
5,Ordered for child who is interested in the solar system. Very easy setup and use. Small stand perfect for a child. Easy to adjust view finder for clarity. Came with some fun bonus posters! I would recommend to anyone for a beginner telescope!
5,Our 3 year old is obsessed with space and the planets so we got him this small starter telescope to use at him and he absolutely loves it. He’s so educated in the planets that he ends up teaching us things!
5,Easy to assemble was set up in just a few minutes. Definitely worth the money.
5,I purchased this for my son for Christmas.  He loved it!  It has so many cool features and it’s easy to assemble and use.  Having the option of attaching your phone is so cool!!  I would definitely recommend!
5,My 12 year old step daughter asked for this telescope for Christmas. It arrived faster than expected which was a pleasant surprise. It is a nice size and quality for the price. Easy enough to set up. Great for a beginning star gazer.
1,I bought this based on the positive reviews but sadly they just don't add up.Base is extremely wobbly making it impossible to focus in on anything with the higher powered lenses. Is only useable with the lowest powered lense.Sadly Jupiter is in it's closest orbit in 70yrs. A 150x telescope would have been great but instead I can only get 15x out of it.Lenses are plastic and lacking clarity. They fog up in humidity and the whole thing flexes and creaks as you move. There's no iota of precision.I've purchased better for $30 at Burlington.Returning immediately. Guess I'll up my budget to something 3x as much before Jupiter is done this month.
5,My daughter loves this and it is the perfect size for her. So easy to use! So glad I bought this one!
5,This telescope was easy to assemble. Instructions were helpful in getting to know its’ various lenses and functions. We are still figuring out how to navigate the night sky but it appears to be of good quality for beginners like us!
5,I ordered this for my son. He has taken an interest of astrology. I think this telescope is great for a beginner. It took a few tries to get the hang of switching the lenses but he's got it figured out.
5,Such a fun and unique gift for my granddaughter.  This offers hours of fun in the winter months as well as the summer.  She said; "Im going to teach you all about the stars." Be still my heart.
5,I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it! It was beyond my expectations!
5,My daughter received this as a Christmas Gift. She absolutely loves it.It took a little practice for her to be able focus the lens but once she figured it out she had the biggest smile.
5,Nice size telescope and easy to use! We have enjoyed it for our family. Wish there was a bag for travel that came with it.
5,My daughter was so excited to open this on Christmas morning! We had to use it that night and we were very impressed with its capabilities for the price. I would recommend this to kids and beginners alike!
5,My 5 year old loves this telescope! From the moment it came out of the box to a month later he loves it! There is a learning curve to be able to see anything. Perfect for beginners!
5,The product was very simple to put together. It is the perfect introductory telescope for individuals who aren’t “enthusiasts.” My kids were so excited to see the moon up close! Lots more learning and fun to accomplish yet!
5,I bought this from my husband for Christmas. He has always wanted a telescope. And this one is perfect for beginners. He and my son have been looking through it cince Christmas. Hands down great item to purchase.

5,This was for my nephew who is obsessed with space and he loves it!! It was very easy to put together and use. I will definitely look for other products from this company!
2,This is a toy and does not accept standard 1.25" eyepieces so you're stuck with the included toy eyepieces.

5,got this for my roommate for an xmas present and she loves it! she's a beginner and found it easy to set up and use right away. great product
5,We are apparently not at intelligent as the people on the planets we want to see. Wish we could get more instruction. Easy to put together and delivery was prompt.  Definitely for beginners. Great product

5,I  HIGHLEY RECOMMEND THE FOR CHILDREN . IT IS VERY WELL MADE AND A GREAT VALUE....A GREAT COMPANYYOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED
1,It started on a cold winter night. I was on the toilet and looking for new hobbies. As my buddies and I were chatting on AOLchats Stargazing hit me. I was astonished why I did not think of this sooner.I quickly opened up my friendly amazon app and searched for cheap telescopes.And the most promoted one for a whopping $62.99 was purchased.The next day as I woke up the doorbell rang oooweeee I thought what could it be? My fresh off the amazon Convair belts telescope has arrived. And was impatient the whole day awaiting darkness to use my brand new telescope.As night fell I rushed to my room to take it out and put it to good use. I was hoping to get some new shwifty insta pics of the moon. But all I saw was darkness and more darkness (Crying emoji.) If I tried to see my cat from 5 feet away or the Buzz Lighter flying around in space I couldn't because all I saw was darkness.And as I am currently sadly writing this I realized that I now am hobbies. Therefore I must seek new hobbies.Any ideas?Thank you for listening to my ted talkwith apple pie in my mouth. Yours truly-Dr. Mush
5,This was purchased for my son and his cousin to use. 7 and 9! They have had so much fun looking at the stars…no complaints here

1,I thought it was just an ok telescope.  Cheap price-cheap quality.  Was thinking about returning it.  Then I got a letter in snail mail (USPS) from someone in the company's customer service team.  If I posted a positive review on Amazon I would get a $30 Amazon gift card!  This is in clear violation of Amazon policy on reviews.  I tried to contact Amazon. When I finally got hold of a live person they didn't seem to care.  So I gave up returned the telescope and decided to post this review.  "Buyer Beware!"

1,This item would have been nice. But they used really cheap plastic materials.  Is not a good item for children or adults.  And not to mention this is a third party transaction and can take up to 5 weeks to get a replacement.

5,Works great so far!
1,As soon as I received the product the lenses dropped out and I have no idea how to put them back. Even following the instructions it’s difficult to use. A lot of parts and not a lot of instructions. Disappointing :(
5,Great for first time star searching. Lightweight and easy use.
5,Nothing to dislike
5,Easy to Use.
5,It’s great!
5,Easy to assemble.
1,It’s easy to assemble but it does not work. The lens on the telescope makes the visuals appear upside down. I tried contacting the company but no one’s responds.
5,My 12 year old son loves his telescope!
1,Never learned how to use. Had to put it up for sale to see if we can get a little bit back
5,Nice objeción
1,The telescope itself was fine nothing special but decent for the money. My problem is they started spamming me after I bought it. I didn't make a purchase to get my information sold so I could be spammed. I'll be contacting Amazon because of this.
1,Easy to assemble but the images are extremely blurry. The moon looked like a ball of light I could not see any detail.
1,No cumple con las características descritas.
1,Got for my grandson 13 and while he and his dad put together it broke but was able to return and refund was given
1,Missing eye pieces so it’s unusable.
2,Could not get an amplified image at all just a headache trying to do so
2,Spend more to get a decent telescope You can not see anything worth looking at.
1,Not worth the cost.
1,You can barely see the moon with this piece of crap
1,So I bought this as a surprise and the finder scope fell apart with the slightest touch. I will definitely be returning this.
2,It not good view and breaks ready so yea
1,I didn't like that it was broken when I got it I'm too busy to have to keep sending stuff back I bought it to see the sky in may
1,Not just trash but absolute trash the stability of this product is that of a humming bird its all over the place. Attaching the Barlow lens did nothing but highlight the imperfections in the mirrors and glass used on the product. The camera attachment is not stable at all and won't work well with newer iPhones. To say this product is a 1 star is to much credit.
2,Couldn't get to focus cheap made
1,Poor quality plastic not functional at night you can't see anything at all.  Daytime use  the images are upsidedown and doesn't focus very well at at. This is basically a toy.
1,I guess I should have read description more closely.  Unit is tabletop which is ok it makes for a nice decoration. No instructions with unit but I guess common sense and patients you will get it together. I guess I was expecting to much wasn’t thrilled with out come. I have Gun scopes that are better.
1,I dislike the fact that you can’t even look at stars with this telescope nor planets nor anything for that matter because with my telescope I couldn’t see anything out of it nothing therefore being garbage
1,Cheap not a $60 telescope. The box was ripped and missing pieces; it was delivered in an Amazon box so whoever put it in there knew what they were doing.
1,This telescope is made to be on a table. The legs a only 2 feet long. Not for standing and looking. Disappointed!
1,Low quality hard to locate objects. Might be ok to look at the moon but don't know since to moon has been rising at almost midnight wouldn't recommend.
1,Pure junk and a waste of my money. My 7 year old even said off the bat this is garbage Dad.
1,not worth the $.  lenses are worthless so view is not good.
1,Hard to use doesn’t work well. Bad purchase
4,Setup was a breeze and my 6 year old is able to use the the telescope with ease. He was so excited when he saw the crators in the moon!
1,No easy for kids use by themselves
1,Difícil de usar
1,This telescope is cheaply made. The stand is really short.
1,Sucks much smaller then you think
5,I purchased this for my grandson's 16th birthday. He loves it! He was so excited and happy to receive this gift. Big hit for Grandma! Most of the time he wants gift cards (which I hate to give). He was happy and so was I. It's a yay! yay! for me
5,Everything seems to be in good order instructions on the eyepiece/lens was a little vague.I'm using it to view the stars and moon. Wonderful item for a beginner.Family had a great time with it last night.
5,We loved this gift as a family we bought this for our 11'year old son and he has loved it as well very easy to use and can see a lot. Highly recommended.
5,We’re using this telescope as a learning an exploration tool for me and my children. We have really enjoyed it so far. The instructions were very easy to follow and the kids love exploring the night sky. We also enjoyed the accessories it came with and the posters. It’s so fun
5,She wanted a telescope for the longest and I finally was able to purchase her one. She loves it
5,Telescope was easy to assemble and was super easy to use. It worked perfect to watch the lunar eclipse
4,My daughter was so happy she got this for Christmas! The assembly was pretty straightforward. It does take an adult to help get it focused. Overall I would recommend!
4,Moon gazing
5,I bought this telescope for my father for Christmas. For years he has mentioned wanting to do more stargazing and years I researched telescopes to try to fit my budget. On Christmas Day when he opened this he was speechless in excitement. Although he’s only been able to use this telescope a few times due to cloudy weather where he lives he is very happy with the features on it. Easy to move around can fit on multiple height tables able to see Saturn through it and takes good photos on his smartphone. As he put it it’s a great telescope for beginners who have yet to really test the waters of stargazing.
5,My 8 year old loved it..
5,Purchased this telescope for my nephew who is 9.  Easy to set up and easy for him to use.  He lives on top of a hill so has a great unobstructed sky view.  He is learning about constellations and has been looking them up online and then trying to find them in the sky.  He also told me there was not really a face on the moon.  We are super pleased with our purchase and would highly recommend.
5,I bought this telescope for my husband as a Christmas gift He loved it. It was easy to assemble and use he loves that he can use his phone to take pictures or videos of the plants and stars he finds. Him and our oldest son love space so this made the perfect gift for them to be able to use together. I would recommended for any beginner who is not familiar with or wants to deal with tons of technology to start with.
5,This IA great 1st timer telescopes.  Set up in less than 5 minutes
5,My 7 year old granddaughter got this for Christmas. She loves it and has so much fun with it.
5,This telescope was purchased for an 11 year old who assembled it on his own.  He has used it several times since Christmas and has enjoyed it.  A good gift.
5,Son in law was excited to share with his kids and my daughter ask for one to use at their lake cottage this summer.
5,This was purchased as a gift for our nephew. He was so excited to get this and immediately started to put it together. This is a perfect starter telescope for kids. Easy to use and works great.
5,great for kids
5,Our family recently spent a couple of nights looking for shooting stars. We used this to help encourage our daughter to continue to learn about stars and constellations. Good entry level telescope.
5,Love our new telescope.
5,Great present for my new space explorer! He is so excited to use this and it was super easy to use. Perfect!
5,Great to start with only issue with set up was figuring out where to put the moon filter but set up wasn’t difficult and had a great time.Marked Ease of Use as 4 stars but not because of the product as much as the fact it’s a telescope so naturally it takes time to get used to.Great Telescope!
5,If you are trying to get your kids into star gazing and such activities this is a great starter telescope. Easy to use and shows great details of the moon.
5,This is the perfect gift for my 10 year old. They are crazy about science. After getting a star projector for a birthday gift I knew the next best thing would be to have then actually see real constellations. Can't wait for it to be warm enough again to sit outside and gaze all night.
5,Great for beginners. Pretty easy to assemble and use. It’s the perfect addition to our star gazing family nights.
5,I bough this as a gift for my 7 year old niece she loves it! She was so excited when she got it it looks sturdy and professional will gladly recommend.
5,My son loves the moon and stars so we thought this would make a great gift for him! My husband seemed to put it together pretty easily. We’ve only used it know but were definitely able to see some stars up close! It will take some learning but I’m happy with our purchase!
5,Came fast. Nice Christmas gift.
5,Great telescope for young kids. Lightweight and easy to use.
5,My grandkids love it!
5,I like that its light weight and easy to carry around.  Awesome for the quality.
1,Flimsy
2,Bought this for my 8 year old who dreams of being an astronaut 👨🏻‍🚀 The assembly is fairly easy and doesn’t require tools. It is very lightweight and portable but you can’t see really well out of it. It’s small and short so you have to hold it up or place it on the ground and lay down.
1,Very cheap product. Returned same.
5,We had the most fun setting up the telescope and reading from the book we had purchased about all the different stars we should view. We were outside for hours using this telescope. Would highly recommend this to all.
5,Love it
5,My son begged for a telescope he LOVES space and astrology so for Christmas I ordered him this one you can actually see pretty far! I can’t wait to see him open it and look at the starts together ☺️
5,I recommend this! Especially for kids. My son is 6 and has been asking for a telescope so he can see the stars at night at camp! We’ve tried it a few times so far. And I’m excited for summer nights to use this with him!
5,Got this for my husband because his first telescope broke. So year's later I got him this for an early Christmas present. :)
5,I purchased this telescope for my oldest son. He has always asked for a telescope so I decided to purchase this one to see if it is something that he will actually use. So far he loves it and I have been using it too! We had a meteor shower recently and it was amazing to see in the telescope. It has been so easy to use and very easy to assemble. It is not too bulky or heavy so we can take it to other locations in the city. We are going to another state in December and we plan to bring this with us to use. I would definitely recommend this product to any beginner.
5,I loved that you can see the moon and planets crystal clear thru the lens. I did have a little trouble finding it visibly through my phone but with a little practice we’re getting better and having so much fun doing so!
5,Easy to set up and use.  We got the telescope for our grandson to use and he loves it!
5,my kid loves it and it is lightweight to carry around
5,This telescope is awesome! My 6 year old grandson is very interested in space so I thought this telescope was perfect for little beginners it's very light weight easy to move around with the tripod very nice looking easy assembly also

5,Came super fast easy to assemble. My nephew loved it!
5,Came easy to prepare nice quality. my grandson loves it!
5,Great learning tool for a curious boy!!
5,This product is an entry level telescope with advanced value features! Easy to use and setup. The best features include the attached phone photo feature and an included stand/mount. I would certainly purchase this product again. The zoom quality is really good for this price range! You wont find a better deal!
5,My 10 year old granddaughter loves the telescope - perfect for her age group!
5,My kid loves it
5,Quick secure delivery. Telescope was easy to assemble. Telescope is actually a Christmas present for a six year old but being a big kid I had to try it out and I was quite pleased.
4,Easy to put together and carry to placed!
5,My son loved this telescope! It was easy to set up and use and had a clear picture. It was a good size for him. This will provide hours of entertainment!
5,I got this telescope for Christmas and it has been awesome.  I live in a fairly light polluted area and it still has done a nice job for exploring the sky.  The telescope comes with an adapter to use your iPhone which I haven’t tried but really look forward to using when the weather warms up.
5,Very easy and good quality
5,My husband loves looking at the stars.  This telescope allows him excellent visibility with out spending a lot of money.  Highly recommended to anyone who loves looking at the stars.
5,Fácil de ensamblar fácil uso increíble como se ve de clara la luna me encanta!!!
5,My son loves to use the telescope every night. It was easy to assemble as well.
5,I bought this for my 9 year old daughter who has been begging for a telescope. I didn’t want to spend a ton of money on one though. This one is good for her. Easy to assemble and not heavy so she can carry it outside herself.

5,Bought it for my son  it’s really good . He loves it . I recommend it 5 stars
5,This telescope was very easy to assemble and a great gift!
5,Got this for 5 and 3 yr old nieces to play with. They think it’s cool. It’s a table top piece. Have not tried all the features and have no need to hook up phone but it comes with that option for those who are interested. It’s also lightweight and not bulky. Can easily travel with it. We are still learning. Fun and educational activity for evenings.
5,Bought this for my three-year-old grandson and we both use it to watch the stars it’s very easy to use very light and you can see clearly in the sky and we look at it practically every night
5,My great grandson has a second story bedroom and now has the world up close with his new telescope. He is ten and has no trouble using it. He lives out in the country where it is very dark at night. Along with the book on the stars that we gave him to go with this telescope he is learning a lot when he takes if from his bedroom window and goes out into the yard at night with it. Good learning tool!
5,All of my life I've wanted to buy and learn how to use a telescope. I finally decided on this Toyerbee model and it came quick enough in the Mail a couple of weeks ago. I have been becoming more skilled at using it every night I can. It was pretty simple to put together sturdy not too heavy nor too light. Since I'm a 60 year old beginner I'm taking my time still learning how to search focus and adjust the different lenses. But so far I have been awed from what I've been able to see through this telescope and the product is living up to its expectations. It was a great buy for me and I'm really enjoying it so far a fabulous hobby!
5,Works great!!! Bought it for my 12 years old daughter and she loves it
5,We are very happy with this telescope considering the price. My daughter loves space and we have spent quality time together by using this telescope. The first time we used it we were able to focus in on Jupiter! It just looked like a white ball but it was so fun for both of us and left me daughter even more excited about space.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Really is good easy to use and put together
5,I thought it would be a nice gesture for my sister til I could buy her another one. But she really likes this one. The quality is great she always sending pictures that she gets from attaching her phone to the telescope.
5,Easy to assemble. Perfect gift for a great price!! Very easy to use even for beginners!
5,Easy to setup useful tripod. I managed to set this up in less than 10 minutes. Sharp lens which allowed nice views of the moon. Good build quality -  looks more expensive than it actually is. A great gift for not only kids but adults as well.
5,Ordered this so my husband and kids could start star gazing. They are having so much fun using it and the picture is very clear! I also got this for a steal because at my time of purchase it was 30% off.
5,it's entertaining.
5,Easy to set up and use
5,My daughter loves it
5,My son wanted a telescope for Christmas and this was the one that we chose. It was relatively affordable and perfect for a starter telescope. All the parts were present and my 11yr old was able to assemble it by himself with little help. We are now looking forward to warmer weather so we can travel out to the country. He got a cellphone this year so he is really excited to possibly take photos with it using this.
5,This telescope was very easy to assemble. As a beginner I don't know much about telescopes but I like this one. Easy for beginners like me. Focusing does take a little bit of work but quickly got the hang of it. Comes with two eye pieces two Barlows and sun and moon filters. Only thing this lacks is a carrying case!! Definitely would recommend for beginners.
5,It was shipped in a timely manner and was packaged nicely. My son is very happy!
5,Overall I was satisfied with the telescope and the service by the seller. Looking at all the parts that had to be put together I felt a little intimidated but the instructions were easy to follow and the assembly was not at all complicated. I personally did return the item because I needed something a little more advance and automated. This scope requires manual movement to go from one target to another where as I wanted a scope which would do that automatically once I put in the target code. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wishes to spark an interest in others or had a spark within themselves for stargazing.
5,I’m so happy I bought this when I did! I had it long enough to practice using it before the last meteor shower of the season. I’ve been able to see some beautiful close shots of the moon. It takes a sec to get the hang of it but I probably over complicated it because I wanted to make sure I was doing everything correctly. I love that it has a phone adapter and remote to use so you don’t shake it when you’re photographing. That really helps! I also love that it’s so powerful yet doesn’t take up a lot of space when stored. Overall I am VERY pleased and can’t wait for next years meteor showers!!!
4,This is a nice telescope for beginners or children.  My 11 year old son was able to work the controls to zoom in on what he was looking at in the sky.
2,Tal vez la óptica sea buena pero los materiales no en general es complicado atinarle a una estrella pero con este aparato es todavía más difícil y si pones accesorios se hace más difícil todavía. Es inestable el triple es muy corto y poco preciso respecto a la posición y el accesorio para celular... intentaré poner una foto de algo pero por el peso no ayuda en la alineación de los lentes. No es una falla pero en mi opinión es comprarle basura a los niños. Personalmente lo compré para ver la luna pero hasta ahora no he podido sacarle ni una foto. Si mejoran la base todo sería más fácil.
5,I bought this telescope for my son’s birthday who is interested in outer space. We love size and it is easy to assemble. My son loves it and checked the moon 🌚 in our balcony. This is a great gift for kids. We plan to bring it when we go camping.
5,Very wonderful telescope. A little difficult to hook your phone to it. My husband and I both tried and our phone will not stay connected but if you use it just with your plain eye it is wonderful.
5,Excelente equipo muy fácil de montar y usar te ofrece unas vistas hermosas
5,Great product as a newbie it took me a little bit to figure it out but nothing a few beers couldn't get me through
5,My son absolutely loves the thelescope. It is perfect for him. He loves looking up at the stars and the moon at night.
5,Bought it for my 9 year old. Easy to use easy to assemble. Great for the price
5,It came fast! I absolutely love this product! My kids love looking at the moon.
5,Picked this up as a starter scope for my four year old that wanted to see the stars. It was a no brainer the price was right the size was right and the ability to attach your phone and share the images was perfect. We took it with us on our beach vacation. And every night I got to show her the moon Saturn mars and Jupiter. Great purchase.
5,This telescope is super portable and easy to use. My kids love it (ages 6 and 7). It was easy for me to figure out and use as an adult with no prior telescope experience.
5,Good quality item! Shipped fast! I recommended it to my friend who placed an order!
5,Got this for my son to start star gazing
5,Bought this for my 9 y/o grandson for Christmas. When it arrived I wanted to make sure it would be something he could use on his own so I assembled it. It's easy to use easy to assemble very nice quality materials and it provides good results.  You get 2 very nice posters for guidance. It's a great starter for him plus the price is excellent for what you get! And Mom/Dad there's a detailed step by step manual so you can join in on the fun too! I highly recommend it!
5,My 9 year old son and I love this product. It’s easy to use quick and easy set up and fun. It’s a great way to have fun and teach kids about astronomy.
5,This was a Christmas gift for a 11yr old boy but it took a 40yr men to figure out how to use it.  All in all he enjoys the gift. Waiting fr a clear night so we can use it.
5,The Toyerbee was very easy to assemble.  It took me about ten minutes.  I am a beginner and the telescope is perfect for me.  I can see the moon and stars very well.  It is lightweight and portable.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Grandson is 9 and he assembled it with Dad supervising
5,Awesome telescope exactly what I was looking for my wife showed an interest in getting a telescope and this is perfect. Easy to assemble and great for a beginner to learn with.

5,Works as described and shipped quickly.
5,Can see planets
5,This is great for someone who hasn’t had a telescope yet. I bought it for my 7 year old and it was definitely a great purchase for him!
5,This is my first telescope I enjoy using it I use to stargaze with my friends it is very easy to carry. It is simple to assemble even without instructions! Im really glad I purchased this! I recommend this for beginners its nice and adjustable! You could give this as a gift to anyone! If I enjoy it anyone can too!
5,The telescope was good made of quality material instructions was clear on how to assemble assembly was easy the standard came on could be a bit more sturdy. But do your research on the magnification on eye lenses and then compare to these.  Making sure this is good for what you're wanting to see in the night sky.
5,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who has has always been interested in science and astronomy. This was her 1st telescope and the 1st telescope I had ever bought. I've done some research on telescopes and decided to give this one a try and WOW! I was amazed at the quality and the viewing quality. Definitely would recommend!!
5,We love it.  We live in New Mexico and the sky has so many stars and we can see the space station from our home.
5,Proper telescope with advanced functions! Love this telescope! 🙂
5,The telescope is portable great for my son & his wife for camping trips.  Easy to set up and take down when it's time to hit the road.

5,My son wanted a telescope to view the sky at night. He was so excited when this came that he put it together all by himself (he’s 11) and called me to tell me how he was able to see the moon at night and some stars as well and the view was very clear. I totally recommend this telescope for beginners.
5,I got this telescope super fast. I put it together in a matter of minutes so easy to do. I was amazed how well this telescope works for the price. I am a true beginner but I really like looking threw it. I didn’t know a lot about it but figured it out on my own easily. I’m still amazed it works so good. If your a beginner try this one out for sure.
5,These are Christmas gifts for my grandchildren and that will be super excited!  Received them very quickly!
5,Easy to assemble and work! We got it for our 2 and 5 year old and to use as a family. It's great for everyone!!
5,My 12 year old had a very easy time assembling this even though it's her first telescope.  I cannot stress enough though that you must be very careful with the lenses! Definitely do not touch them they are very fragile. The attachments are really nice too good view
5,We were so excited to get this and my son loved it!
5,The seller shipped incredibly fast the description of the telescope was complete and very informative.  This is the best telescope that I have ever encountered and the price was just right!
5,a little bit hard to assemble but overall it is a good product and a good gift for kids.
5,This kit is great for beginners your able to see the moon and many more easy to set up the phone adapter does not fit newer phones though if you have more than one camera but if that’s not an issue it’s a fantastic piece included two eye pieces and 2 longer barrow lenses there’s an adapter that will connect to your phone to take pictures if you’d like and it’s sturdy on grass!!
5,This is great for my young daughter who is a beginner. It is not too complex and is easy for her to use and learn more about telescopes and introduce her to astronomy.
1,I like the compact size but because it is so small it doesn't have the ability to focus on items far away.  Not enough light allowed in the aperture available to use any higher magnifications at night.  Fun for kids to play with but disappointing based on the way it was marketed for celestial viewing.
1,Telescope is what is expected for the price range. It’s light and portable. Great starter to see how interested your loved one is going to be before breaking the bank on a high powered-high end future paper weight.
5,Such a great find! The perfect size for my son he loves it. It’s so easy to set up and use. Definitely recommend!
5,This is such a great telescope for kids and adults. We enjoying using it!
