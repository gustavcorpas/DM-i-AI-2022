5,When the pandemic hit I bought a cheaper version. It made a lot of noise when I moved it and couldn’t hold up my mic. This one is very sturdy and makes no noise when I move it. I use it with a Yeti X mic. The clamp that holds it on the desk is very strong too.
5,I originally purchased the Rode PSA1 Swivel Mount Studio Microphone Boom Arm in 2012 and used it with my Blue Yeti microphone. It was very reliable. Earlier this year I was looking for a new boom arm and saw this and decided to try it out. Here is my comparison of both products.  I am using the Blue shock mount and a pop filter in addition to my Blue Yeti microphone.InstallationInstallation for both products is very easy and quick in that you just clamp it to the edge of your desk. Between the two I would judge the base of the Blue boom arm to sturdier than the Rode. You screw in the shock mount on end of the boom arm screw in the Blue Yeti into the shock mount and the clamp the pop filter to edge of the shock mount and twist it until it is in front of the microphone.  I was able to attach the Rode boom arm to the back side of my desk so it will be out of the way when not in use. I was not able to do that with the Blue boom arm because I just could not get it to adjust to being in the right position when recording so I had to attach it to the side of my desk. This means it will get in my way when not in use as I move things around on my desk.Overall for installation Rode wins because it is not in the way when not in use.Adjusting PlacementFor Rode you just grab it and move it where you need to have the mic placed for recording. Once you get it placed you have to let go and hope that it does not automatically start to retract due to the weight. Sometimes I have to position it wait for it to rise reposition it and wait for it to rise and reposition it until eventually it stays in place. For Blue boom arm it has three joints that you can rotate to move the mic into position. They all have a knob that you twist to loosen for it to move and when you have mic positioned then you twist it to lock it in place. Adjusting these knobs can be a challenge. But once you have the mic in place it will not move. I do 4 hours of podcast recording every Sunday and it stays in place the whole time.Overall for quickly positioning the Rode wins but you have to fidget with it. If you want the positioning to be permanent and stay there then the Blue wins by a wide margin.Cable OrganizationThe Rode boom arm comes with some velcro straps that you can use to gather cables and then put the velcro strap over the boom arm. You get two straps to attach the cable on both halves of the boom arm. Blue on the other hand includes a slot built into the boom itself for the cables. Since it is built into the boom itself the cables are completely hidden from view. If you are on air when recording this is an extremely nice feature because the cables do not distract from your image on the screen. For Rode the cables are very visible on the screen.Overall Blue wins this hands downOverall User ExperienceI had my original Rode boom arm for 5 years. Eventually it got to the point where it sagged from the weight and I had to purchase a second one in 2017. I have had the Blue arm for less than half a year. I was satisfied with the Rode arm so much that when I needed to replace it I purchased it again and didn't even bother comparing any other product. When I started a new podcast as well as recording training videos I decided to get a new setup so it was consistent in color. (My original Blue yeti mic was silver and shockmount was black). I got a new black Yeti mic black shock mount and realized they made a boom stand. After reading the reviews I decided to invest in it. I have been beyond pleased with this setup compared to the Rode. Knowing everything that I know now if I had to start over again I would purchase the Blue boom arm over the Rode hands down.
5,When I originally purchased this I had the Blue Yeti already on a desk stand or pedestal and it picked up a lot of vibration and typing sounds so I wanted to get a arm instead. Right off the bat I could not mount the arm to my desk. The overhang on my desk is only about an inch (3rd photo) so not enough material for the base clamp (2nd and 4th photo). Mounting it to a secure level surface is essential. I picked up a table where I could clamp the stand too. I had used a nearby plant stand but it was unstable and the microphone would swerve 180 degrees. So that being solved you must attach your mic first and loosen all of the joints as well as a screw plate at the end of the arm that you insert in the base. There are videos on this and I recommend you watch them. Once you get the mic and arm mounted following the videos got me in the right place.  My biggest issue is the tightening mechanism of the actual clamp. See 2nd photo. I don’t know what they call this but when you turn that to tighten it can hit up against what you are fastening the clamp to. It doesn’t have adjustable sliding bar that you can grab onto and turn it in a tight spot. You would want that for a desk mount. If I had another inch of overhang I would have tried to mount it on my desk but even then the tightening knob is fixed so you can’t tighten it in a small area where if the handle you hold were adjustable it would. You need about 3” of overhang to get the base on securely and it has to be level. Once I got over that hurdle and watched the videos I am very happy with the mount. I can move the mic where I need it and it stays put. I like the sleekness of the arm and the ability to hide the cord. I bought a longer cord than what came with the Blue Yeti. I loosened the two joints on the arm. I loosened the screw at the base of the arm (not the base it self) before I inserted it and then I moved the mic into position and then tightened the two joint turns.  If you have a table type of desk this should work fine. My desk didn’t provide enough grab space therefore requiring me to get another table. That being said the weight of the stand started to tip over that table so I added some counterweight. If you have a desk like mine you might want to have a bookshelf nearby or a printer stand something suitable for you to affix the clamp provided.
5,The boom arm is very stable and stays in position.  The biggest concern I had when considering the purchase was the mounting system -- how it attaches to the desktop.  My desktop is glass with a metal support frame. But I took the gamble bought the thing and discovered to my relief that the mounting bracket cleared my frame and was easy to secure.  I'm very happy with it.  The overall quality of the boom-arm easily justifies the price point.  The ease of use now makes it an essential tool for more professional sound quality.  Highly recommend.
3,Nice product design but this is designed exclusively for1. overhead mic use2. Boom arm Attachment from 3+ feet away from mic position.The arm is minimally adjustable. If you have a small table do. Not. Buy. This.Every time I try to adjust it on my medium size table for the boom arm to come from the side instead of the top the arm tighteners literally cannot be tightened enough to keep it in place. It's extremely frustrating.Additionally the mic arm has very limited range of motion backwards/outwards it has a hard stop at about 70degrees from the table.All other mic arms I've had I've used at a 45 degree and kicked back so I can fix the arm on the table on the same side as where I sit.If you like your mic overhead go for it. Any other mic configuration look elsewhere.
3,Now I'm  not a boom arm expert but I will compare the Blue Compass boom arm to the PSA1 Rode boom arm so you can understand my reason for the rating.Refer to bottom for quick pros/cons of each boom armsFirstly I like how simple and clean it looks for a 100 dollar boom arm.  This boom arm has housing that covers up the wires and cords. The desk clamp is small sleek  and easy to attach to any desk. This boom arm just fits comfortably on it. It even comes with an adapter theading for different size mics.What I hated about is what everyone else hates about the Blue Compass; it does not accurately stay in place.  If you bend the first joint diagonally and then bend the next joint more than 90s degrees the arm will jolt back and not stay no matter what.  Even untightening the tension screw and adjusting the joint knobs it will not stay in place accurately. For example you cannot position the last joint( where you can angle the mic horizontally) how you want because it will spring out of position.  (Refer to pictures) I'm  literally holding it from springing up even with the tension screw adjusted and joints tightened. You are limited on the angles you can place your mic on the Blue Compass because when you move the arm the arm does not have a mechanism to retain the mic angle like PSA1 Rode does. You are subject to the way the angle of the mic is screwed in on sometimes. It might be facing up when you want it towards you. How I wanted my mic was to be horizontal but low near my mouth so that I can be heard and see my computer screen. This is not possible. It is with the PSA1 Rode!Compared to PSA1 Rode the Rode stays in place no matter where you place your mic. (Pic added for reference)It has one screw on the top joint that controls all the tension. You dont even have to adjust the other joints. Even the angle of that your mic was in will stay the same with the PSA1 Rode because its got two arms that keep the mic angle regardless if the boom arm position. With the Rode you just have to tighten on the top joint screw and it will stay. I can even adjust the angle the mic is in the boom arm to be horizontally. Comes with an thread adapter too. The only drawback is the there is no housing for the cables and desk clamp is a bit wider but other than that I prefer the PSA1 Rode over the Blue Compass. I can live with thr slightly  wider clamp and I can easily buy boom arm cable sleeves or cable sleeves to address the housing issue. Also it does come with 3 velcro strips to hold the cables.Blue CompassPros-Housing Hides wires(looks clean)-small strong desk clamp-thread adapter-Has Tension screw-joints can be tightenedCons-Does not stay in place( jolts back alot)-Limited angles-Does not retain mic angle when arm is reposition-Tension screw mechanism not the best-Joints need to be adjusted even after tension screwPSA1 RodePros-Can retain mic angle regardless of arm position-Has thread Adapter-Has Tension screw (on highest joint)-Joints don't need be tighten if tension screw adjustedCons-slightly bigger desk clamp (not much difference though-no cable/wire housing( can be fixed with cable sleeves
3,UPDATE: Amazon shipped a replacement.  The second boom did not have the tension issue that I saw with the first.  2 full turns of the bottom tension screw made a noticeable difference in the stiffness of the arm.  The middle joint locking mechanism is also able to hold the arm in place instead of floating back up to vertical.  I would say that this second arm is working perfectly.  Given my first experience and those of many reviewers here there appears to be a quality issue with the product.  If you experience it a replacement may just do the trick.ORIGINAL REVIEW----------------------I have really liked my Blue microphone.  Came to a point where I decided to put it on a boom instead of a stand and figured Blue would be there for me with the same quality as the mic.  I was wrong.  Very wrong.TENSION SCREWMy problem with the arm began with the tension adjustment screw at the bottom.  This arm has way too much tension even for a heavy mic.  I loosened it up about a half turn at a time to check the tension and honestly 4 full turns later it felt no different.  Even loosened significantly it feels more like a workout device than a boom to hold a mic.CLAMP ISSUESI mounted the clamp (be aware that the plastic key for the clamp sticks out further than the diameter of the socket.  In my case that meant I couldn't mount it where I wanted to because the lip of my desk is 2" deep.  That's perfect for the top of the clamp but the key is 2.25" so I can't turn it as it hits the desk.  If you are looking at this bracket be sure that you have at least 2.25" clearance so that you can tighten it.MID-BOOM JOINTI moved the arm to a less ideal spot to try it out.  In this new spot I needed the second joint to bend.  Again I had problems with the joint being so strong that the mic and isolation mount would just float right back up until the boom was practically straight.  Tightening the joint at the base had done a good job of keeping that joint where I wanted so I proceeded to do the same to the second joint.  That didn't go so well as the joint was so strong that I tightened it past the limit of the plastic cover and it still was so strong that it would go straight with everything on it!When I say I tightened it past the limit take a look at the photo to see what I mean.  Essentially the plastic cap is a socket head for a bolt that runs through the joint.  As you turn the cap you are driving the bolt deeper into the joint.  Since the plastic cap isn't traveling down the bolt gets low enough to pop out of the plastic cap and you're done.  There's no way to reverse the bolt because the socket inside the cap is too shallow.This is a poor design for 2 reasons:  1) The socket inside the cap is plastic despite the fact that it's job is to turn a metal bolt with significant force and 2) The bolt can be irreversibly driven by the cap to a point where it is too deep to remove.  There should be a limiter.CHANNEL COVERSI really do like the channel but wow those channel covers are finger nail busters!CONCLUSIONMy mic is back on the stand it came with.  I have a $99 boom that's garbage and a shock mount I can't use until I get an arm that works.  Perhaps I got a bum one but from the other reviews here I am thinking that either it's just poorly designed or there is a bad run of these. I figure an Amazon replacement is going to be from the same lot.
5,Love this boom arm. 10x more adjustable and sturdy than the last 2 microphone arms I have bought. You can mount a microphone to be held above the mounting point rather than the only option of letting the mic hang from below. Great cable management routing and clips.With a Shure SM7B you will have to keep the mic on an angle or the XLR cable will hit the pivot point restricting movement. Not a huge deal unless you want the arm extending from directly in front of you.
5,Dear BlueI bought this arm for my Blue Yeti microphone in navy blue that I use for work. I work from home permanently and I am on zoom/teams calls almost every day so I needed a headset or a microphone. I choose microphone because my wireless headset needs to be plugged in for charging every day and some days I forget to. With the Blue Yeti mic it is always connected and ready to go.I was using the original stand that it came with but I would have to move it out the way of my second monitor when it’s not in use. Getting this boom arm allows me to move it close to my mouth without being in the middle of the camera. It was easy to install and it is perfect for holding my mic. This boom arm seems to be made of thick metal material and has an inner channel for you to put your usb cable in as cable management.I had to buy the Blue model shock mount to mount my mic to the arm. Again install was easy and although I have yet to test if it works you can tell from the photo that it will work and it should work with no problems.Thanks.
4,Great boom quality is good material is sturdy. only issue is the tension issues these things have commonly. Pulling down on the mic will not stay in place it tends to ride back up even after all the adjustments to the tension points on the arm and the bottom of the base. works fine but wont go super low because tension is too much.
3,It's a pretty piece of equipment so Blue has that going for them or is it Logitech now? Can't remember. ANYWAYS. It's definitely made well the springs are nice and almost piston like. The base is great nice c-clamp and rotation on it without any squeaking (I think it's lubed that's why though extra grease isn't provided in the box). Adjusting the tension so it doesn't fling back up is terrible. The wing-nut  is too shallow for adult male hands and I don't have large hands more medium-sized. Then there's also ZERO ridges or grips on the wings to give purchase to. Meaning it's hard to adjust. It's a great lesson of Form sacrificing function. Since it's a beautiful piece of equipment. The wire channels are nice hard to open if you cut your nails too short but very sleek. The mics I'm using with it aren't light mics they're the SHURE SM 7B I think is the proper name for them and never having owned a Blue Yeti or their mics can't say if their mics are that much heavier than the Shure which feels like it's a pound of mic to begin with can't imagine the Yetis are much heavier. Also if you're buying this for the Shure make sure to pick up the SHURE extender piece I think it was less than $10 it screws onto the mic arm and drops the SHURE about 2 inches so you have full 360 motion if need be without it you're only getting about 90 degree of motion given how weird and clunky the Shure mic is made. Great mics but not all boom-arm friendly. Though at the $400 asking point you'd think they could throw in that inexpensive extender.Conclusion:Buy the cheaper scissor styled ones they're not pretty but they work better have parts you can swap out easily and if you want to quite a spring pick up some lithium grease at home depot or lowes or on amazon slap that on the spring and you're good to go. Or go with the more expensive Gator brand that look similar to this but is made with SHURES and ElectroVoices in mind and not just the Yetis. I think those are like $200 non-lit and are hydraulic based. I have been tempted to take apart the Compass at the screw points to see what they're using see if I could just replace it with a standard wingnut for easier manipulation. Haven't done it yet. Great form terrible function hopefully now being bought out by Logitech that will be fixed. Since Logitech can and usually does both well. Yeti owners seem to like this but this is being sold as an arm for other mics outside of Blue's line.
5,I absolutely love this product it was a little stiff to set up until I put the heavy Mic on. Although I was just about to adjust the tension screw but after the mic weight was added it was perfect. This product is a solid smooth elegant addition to any set up & when I upgrade to a second mic I'll definitely get this one again
5,Ok here's the run down.I have a Blue Yeti that I hang suspended from a boom arm. Sound familiar?Well..... I have purchased 5 different boom arms over the past year and every one of them would not hold the weight of the microphone with any stability. Every one of them should have - the mic is less than the weight they claim to carry.But I think the goal here is not can it carry; but what can it LIFT?Within 10 minutes of installation I finally have a mic boom that works EXACTLY the way I want it to.Don't buy cheap junk expecting it to work. I don't think there is anything cheaper than the Compass on Amazon that will really work under day to day usage.One final note; you can drill a small hole in the top of your desk where you want to mount the boom. This is far more steady that the clamp; especially if you have tapered edges on your desk like I do.
4,This is typical to watch one will find for quality professional grade boom arms.Yes there are more expensive if one wants but this one is a nice unit for the money.  Period.
4,This product is well build and works great if you use with Yeti microphone.  I tried using this with a microphone that weight less than 1 lb and it does not work well.  The mid-joint tension is too high.  This is after releasing the tension to not tension at all.  Hope this help.
4,I ignored the reviews saying that the springs were strong and it's hard to adjust the dials to lock this thing into place--and I realize that they weren't exaggerating lol. I think its easier to set when the mic is in place though. Maybe grab a good wrench or pliers if you wanna adjust the angle of this thing esp if you have bad wrists. Also this thing is great quality but it should not cost so much money. I didn't trust the others since I'm replacing a <50$ arm because it broke...
5,I waited about two months to make sure everything before writing this review. So far I love the stand. It’s easy to move around move up and down and I can easily just place it on other sides of my table if needed to. I was worried the weight of my Yeti X would be too much due to the comments but my Yeti X and the stand are doing just fine! I did have to look at one YouTube videos to figure out how to put the stand together but it took less than 5 minutes. Now I have the perfect streamer set up and my sound is much better than it previously was.
4,Like many other reviews might have pointed out the spring on this thing is a nail buster.Good things- Good looking- Simple set up procedure- Neat cable channelBad:- Spring strength- Access to cable channel could be done betterMore about the bad points:So this boom arm has spring adjustment which means it will naturally want to straighten out unless you adjust it with the knob on the side of the 2 joints at the bottom point where it connects to the table clamp and at the middle point. The problem is it wants to straighten itself out too much. For my microphone at around 400-450 grams (a little less than 1 lb) even if I squeeze it to the point that I believe is the hardest humanly possible and without causing permanent damage this thing cannot bend to a 90 degree not even close.So if you have a nice heavy mic this will be less of a problem. If you have something that weighs about the same as mine or less you are better off with something else; though if you're splurging on a $100 boom arm I imagine your mic would be a really nice one not like mine.If your mic is heavier but still run into this problem do ask for an exchange through Amazon as it very possibly will fix your problem. I'm not doing it because I'm not particularly mad with the current level that my boom arm is at but it is a thing to point out
3,It is sturdy and the tension is nice and strong for heavy mics.  The tension adjusting knobs are plastic and it is now stripped.  The tension is too strong.  Purchased in May and now useless in August.  This thing lasted (3) months.  NOT worth $99.
4,Overall a great mic arm. sleek design built in cable management with a solid and quality feel.However you will need a really heavy microphone to keep this thing from going into low earth orbit. Even with the tensioner  turned all the way down it still pulls my Shure SM7 mics up and since the tension runs down the spine they straighten out and don't just bend at the elbow.Also note that it ships with an edge mount only. If you want to bolt it through your desktop you'll need to order an adapter that Blue sells.
4,This mount looks great and all but for $100 this thing has the strongest tension spring that works against you when trying to set it up. The friction plate knobs to keep it from going up are just not enough to hold it in place and you feel like you will break the knobs. After cranking down on it I finally got my Blue Yeti to hold still. That’s my only gripe really.
2,I'm using a Blue Yeti. Despite being made by the same company that makes the Yeti this stand will not hold the mic steady in one place. The overbuilt spring will simply yank it back to where it was previously the hand tensioners are too flimsy to stop this from happening and the tension adjustment in the base was as loose as possible; there was no way to weaken the spring. One time it even yanked back to a position where it almost smacked my mic against my monitor.The spring was SO strong in fact that during assembly it yanked the frame toward what as labeled as the wrong direction causing a small crack in the plastic. Blue you can have a "wrong way" for the arm to bend if you want but you can't just LET it bend that way when the spring is *already* yanking it in that direction. That's just terrible design! If the arm can damage itself by bending a certain way IT SHOULDN'T BEND THAT WAY. A little sticker that's going to be removed isn't going to stop that from happening.I appreciate the aesthetics I appreciate the cable management channel but the function and design is just not there.
3,It won’t stay in the position I need it to. The little clips on the side just won’t clamp down tight enough. I’m not sure if my mic isn’t heavy enough or if the stand is just no good.
3,Try to put a heavy microphone on it  thought they were overreacting but no  ingot the blue mini and the arm doesn’t feel the weight  I’ve tighten everything and it barely holds it  but it’s my bad I read the reviews and didn’t take it seriously  besides that it’s sturdy and it looks badass
5,I'm writing this review almost a year later. I bought this stand in March of 2021. I use it constantly. I bought this for streaming after my friend gave me really good reviews on it.I'll start this off by saying the stand is great its sturdy and it's minimal style look fantastic. I love that you're able to hide you mic cable along the back of the stand. I feel it has decent motion though you have to find a balance as the stand is somewhat difficult to adjust. I use the Blue Yeti Nano USB Mic with it and it holds up. Now the only issue I have had with this stand is the set up. I watched videos upon videos to figure out how to keep the stand bent. Initially it reverted to its straight out position. It takes a bit to get used to adjusting the dials and can be really frustrating.Overall the stand is fantastic! If you're just starting to stream I would definitely go with something a bit cheaper at first but ultimately it's up to you!
5,This is a great upgrade from those "luxo-lamp" style arms with exposed springs.  If you bump or move one of those with a live mic the springs can vibrate and be heard.  With this arm there are no exposed springs and no sound when you move it.  The tabletop clamp is quite sturdy and holds fast.  Also it is able to hold a fair mount of weight.  I tried attaching a big camera ball-head to it and sticking a Sony A7R camera and lens weighting 1.5 or 2 pounds and it held it easily.If you have an unusually light or heavy mic on this you may need to adjust the tension screw in the bottom of the arm to balance the weight so it will stay in place without drooping or rising.  There are little plastic handles at every joint you can use to adjust tension too but you need to balance the tension with the screw inside the base of the arm FIRST or the tensioners on the joints won't be effective.Also the tube style arm looks much better on camera than the luxo-lamp style spring arms!  There is a channel down the back of the arm to keep your mic cable out of the way.  This doesn't come with any mic holder on the end just a 3/8 or 5/8 screw so be sure to get a holder for your mic.  If you are using a shotgun mic you may need something with a swivel so you can point the mic in the right direction.
2,I had heard from a coworker that this was a great boom arm to get since I had been looking to upgrade from my super cheap one. He said that it was great and that it's the best boom arm on the market but I was looking at the Rode PSA1. I eventually went with the Blue Compass and when I got it I immediately realized how tight the springs were.Yes I know you can change the tension of the springs inside the arm with the screw and yes I know you can tighten the joints to make them hold position better. First off there is no point in setting my mic up to only sit in one spot with a boom arm that can't move after I tighten it down I would have just saved $90 and gotten a table stand if that's what I wanted. I want to be able to move it out of the way when I'm not using it and when I need it I can just pull it over in front of my mouth and do what I need to do.Secondly that tension screw literally does nothing. I had it all the way tightened and all the way loosened and it still didn't make a difference. I even took the screw out just to see what would happen and still absolutely no difference. I ended up getting a refund and getting a Rode PSA1 and I've only had  that boom arm for about a day now but I can tell you with 100% confidence the Rode PSA1 is THE best boom arm money can buy. Even if it costs and extra $20 it's worth it.
3,Let's face it It looks cool right? That's why I bought it. Has that Blue logo on the side that looks so professional and clean. But then you get the thing and found out it's a garbage fire.First off the front of the boom arm will lift up even when you have it CRANKED to not move.The knobs are made of plastic and made me feel like I was going to break them.The front arm is off center and looks like it's slightly broken.The turn knob under brace SUCKS!!! It will not work on a plastic fold out table and the little disk that is supposed to give it more surface fell off and I had to manually put it back on.The thing is bent in part of the metal.The little run to add your wire you have to get a screw driver for.. there is no WAY you can pull them up by hand.
2,I bought this because I work from home I make music as a hobby I’m a full time college student and I’m upgrading my mic setup. I heard hundreds of great reviews. The material is great and the instructions don't require a degree in engineering. However as I was adjusting to my personal preferences I was adjusting the middle adjuster and with four full rotations the adjuster fell off. I know the tension is a Philips head screw at the bottom is for tension I’ve read the instructions I’ve done the homework. I hate writing reviews cause I feel like a Karen but if I can get this swapped I’d be content.
4,Compared to what I have seen on amazon this is visually one of the best looking microphone arms.It feels incredibly sturdy and the base feels premium with a sturdy base that the arm rotates on.My Shure SM7B looks right at home with it and as one of the heavier mic's it doesn't cause the arm to droop.The little cable route in the center of the arm makes for a very clean look.The only downfall on this as many others have complained is that the springs are I would say 1-2 lbs too heavy. Even with a heavy mic like the SM7B the base spring tends to retract when the arm is pulled too far. The tension locking dials at the joints can't be tightened very much so you are kind of out of luck. There is a screw in the base that can be adjusted but too much and the plate is real loose.Honestly if they put in slightly lighter springs this stand would be a 5 star. but its so close to amazing.Honestly for the money this is probably one of the best you can buy.
4,I'd read a bunch of reviews on this thing before I bought it and I really didn't know what to expect.  It is a little squirrely for sure the way you have to adjust it and how it acts but if you mess with it enough it'll do what you need it to (or at least for me that's the case).  I will say this though for my guests in my studio I went with two PSA1's instead of 2 more of these. 'Shrug'.  The PSA1's are just so much more versatile and easy to move around. The last thing I want is my guests befuddled about equipment while they're in here.  I do like mine for me though.Also for the life of me I can't figure out nor understand why there isn't a flush mount for the table included with it like the Rode's have.  From there they show that they have a cheap looking plastic one on their website but it's not in stock. It hasn't been and when I'd called them about it the nice lady had no clue when or if ever they would have them back for actual sale.  I don't know. I just think that's kind of weak for a company like Blue.  I'll get around to either making one myself or seeing if it'll slide into my other Rode mounts.  If I ever do I'll get back to you on that.Good day.I'm giving it a 3.5 stars.
4,I have had this Mic arm for two years like most i did not read the manual very thoroughly. I thought maybe my shuresm7b was just too heavy so for two years i just accepted it the arm would sag like crazy. Until i read someone else in the reviews mention a screw at the bottom of the arm its a small silver screw near the bottom part that attaches to the base in the desk. If you turn it to the right or clockwise it makes the arm more stiff to hold heaver mics if you turn it to the left it loosens the arm to if you have a light microphone it wont just spring up. Play around with it and it should work just fine.Asides from the tension issue i had this is a very good high quality boom arm. This is worth every penny i had the cheap 20$ arms that have the spring showing they look horrible and don't last at all.I would highly recommend this boom arm for the quality and the clean look. It feels like it will last for years.
4,Good quality sturdy enough gets better after using for a while  using ( blue yeti standard microphone)
5,Bought for my brother to complete his streaming setup. Decluttered his desktop and allows a wider range of motion.
5,i upgraded my innogear boom with internal springs for this arm just because i always wanted it even if for nothing else than its design and how absolutely beautiful it looks when sitting on the desk. it dosent come with the bushing nut thing to allow you to drill a hole and semi permanent mount to your desk where ever you want but the well designed side desk mount dose just as good of a job and is free i was told by friends to not even bother with the friction nuts on the side of the boom and for good reason you simply dont need to use them at all just use the screw on the bottom on the boom to adjust the tension for the blue yeti you can have it all the way loos and have perfect smooth operation of all angles and it will easily stay anywhere you want it too trust me do not over tighten those side friction bolts or else your going to break this arm they simply dont do much so just accept what you can get out of them and do it the rite way with the spring tension instead. careful though because just buying this boom arm alone made me randomly decide to get rid of my blackout edition blue yeti and upgrade to an xlr blue spark sl and buy a scarlet solo audio interface just because of how nice it is so youll most likely be doing the same if your in a similar position as i was.
4,This is exactly as advertised. Biggest problem is that while the friction locks on the top and base of the arm work as expected the lock at the middle joint of the arm refuses to hold the arm in place unless you have enough weight. This results in your arm trying to return to an upright position even if you have a microphone attached.For example I use a Blue Yeti USB microphone. It technically meets the weight requirements for this boom it's only over by by few tenths of an ounce. Yet even with the middle lock tightened as far as it will go and the spring tension adjusted for the weight the arm will try to return to upright. It wasn't until I added a shock mount that the weight finally countered the spring tension and kept the boom in place. If you search around you will see that many have the same issue.Other than that this thing works fine.
1,I've owned this arm for almost three years now.PROS1. Looks great.2. Smartly designed cable management channel works very well!3. Silent! Great for if you need to make small adjustments and don't want it to get picked up on mic (and you will need to make tons of adjustments).CONS1. Fails in its primary task: Holding your microphone up.2. Incredibly difficult to tighten.3. Is not sturdy enough to hold to one position requiring LOTS of micro-adjustments.I've owned this microphone arm for a very long time and since the beginning it has more or less failed to work adequately but it has only gotten worse as time has gone on. It used to be that it would sag about an inch after adjusting it but would "settle" into place so you could adjust it slightly too high and let it slowly sag into a position you actually found workable. Not a good time but I could live with it. In order to get it to even lock into position this way you'd have to break your fingers trying to tighten it into place because the "hand tightened friction hinges" as they call them are very uncomfortable to tighten down and you'll have to tighten them 3x further than you'd expect to get them to function. There's a screw on the underside that you can adjust but it is imprecise to say the least and does not seem to make much of a difference past a certain point.I've used this mic with a Blue Yeti an Audio Technica AT-2035 and a Shure SM7b and it fails to hold any of them up adequately unless you leave the first joint sticking straight up. I've heard other people say it's the middle joint that fails but for me it's the longest/strongest one at the base of the arm. If I leave it sticking straight up it will hold but this position really only works for my Blue Yeti and even then I don't find this useful for Streaming maybe a podcast where you don't need to be on your computer much but having a huge mic like a Yeti coming in from over the top of my head blocks all view to my monitors and is a pain. With the Shure SM7b this isn't even a workable position so I need it to stretch out to come in below my mouth and from this angle the leverage makes it impossible to stay in place.This has only gotten worse with time and at this point despite the $100+ investment I have to throw this mic arm in the trash because it won't hold up my microphone at all anymore and no matter how hard a tighten it down it will immediately sag until it drops onto my tabletop. Completely useless to me.It's a beautiful mic arm and is very tempting to buy but pass on this one.
3,Well... it was never AMAZING but4 it did the job.Here we are about 2 years down the line and it no longer support itself so I'm off to buy another one... but DEF. not a Blue Microphone variant.I just can't comprehend a boom arm this expensive failing so quickly.. especially when I rarely if ever move the stinking thing.Whatever...Hard pass on this types of Booms from here on out.
4,The build quality is good but not great... I expected it to feel “more dense” if that makes sense? It’s lightweight which is a plus and minus. The material felt cheaper than I wanted it toThe springs are FANTASTIC on this. They work almost too well and I knew that going into it. Every review I’ve read mentioned the powerful springsMy biggest issue is that desk mount. The one you tighten not the permanent “desk hole-punching one” the very first time I went to tighten it to my desk this TINY little round piece broke off that holds the metal plate on the bottom in place... making it much more difficult to put the mount together now that I have to do this balancing act with the metal disc/plate so it doesn’t fall off while screwingI went back and ordered the RODE PSA1 instead and couldn’t be happier. The psa1 is far superior
5,Very pleased with the quality of this product. I use a Yeti Blue mic for recording eLearning training voiceovers. The Yeti Blue mic is heavy and was really taxing the strength of a cheaper boom arm I was using. One of the things that's really nice about Blue Compass boom arm is that the C-clamp is much stronger than cheaper versions and fits better over thick desktops (I use a standing desk and the desktop is about 2 inches thick). The C-clamp is also deeper than cheaper versions so it really holds well with minimal vibration. Another thing I like about this boom arm is how the base of the arm sits on the desktop. The full weight of the base sits on top of the desk rather than off the desk like cheaper boom arms do. This means that I can rotate the boom arm a full 360 and at no point will the weight of the mic be in free space (this is a big issue with cheap models). The last thing I like is that there are grooves in the boom arm to conceal the mic cable. This looks much better than having the cable flopping loose or zip-tying it like I had to do with the cheap boom arm I had. Yes the Blue Compass Premium Tube-Style Broadcast Boom Arm is more expensive. But it seems like the best option if you plan on pairing it with a Yeti mic.
3,I unboxed and set this up about an hour ago and have been trying to get it to work properly and finally gave up.Lets start off with pros- it looks really good and I like the small mount for the microphone. Those are the 2 things I can think of. The cons- its got plastic in all the wrong the places. To clarify the screwing mechanism has a plastic handle so you tighten to get the arm to stop extending and then it'll snap because underneath is the metal bolt. Plastic is going to break eventually in my opinion. Also the sleeve is plastic and poorly cut so it has sharp edges right where you would run the XLR cable down. Last but not the least the metal ring the secures the clamp is tiny and flimsy comparted to other boom arms I've used. Wouldn't surprise me to hear people have issues with it breaking off.In all this is way too expensive to be this poorly constructed/quality and adjustments don't do much from my experience. I tightened and loosened the friction points. Didn't change much. I tightened and loosened the screw at the bottom. Changed very little. The main issue seems to be the middle bend. No matter what my Shure MV7 would always ascend to the heavens and then dangle above my head. Disappointedd to say the least with the purchase. If you have a heavier mic then it may well work but for me it didn't work at all.
5,I was in the mood for a boom arm to complete my desktop voice over setup. I read the reviews watched the comparison videos and strongly considered the PSA vs the Compass. Having owned Blue products in the past (cf Blue Mouse) I opted for the Compass. I was a little concerned at first as the desk clamp isn't very deep; my desk has carved edges so I had to really tighten the heck out of the clamp to secure it solidly to the table. Preferring not to have a slippage accident I ordered the table mount add-on. It's in now and the arm is solid as a rock. Yeah it's a little stiff; and by stiff I mean it goes where I want it and doesn't drift. I've tried it with an RE-20 and a TLM-103 and with a little adjustment both work flawlessly with the arm.What's really key here is to use the tensioning screw inside the base. That done it's been perfect. Solid build; stays where I put it; silent as a lamb; sleek design; the mic cable fits in the channel perfectly; and it doesn't look like the lamp I had in college...sometime in the previous century!
3,This boom arm is designed to be attached to a free-standing desk with space either in the back or the sides. My desk is built-in fairing a window and attached to floor-to-ceiling bookcases on the sides. Therefore I could only attach the boom to the front of my desk as far as possible to the corner. This setup blocked my view of my monitors and took up desk space. The boom also had trouble remaining in the position where it was placed. I ended up returning it.
5,The build quality of the boom arm is fantastic.  It looks great and is extremely sturdy.I saw several other reviews that commented on the strength of the spring and how the boom arm would raise by itself.  I almost didn't buy it because of those review but then I saw a review that mentioned the tension adjustment screw and I thought the negative reviews were from people who didn't realize they needed to adjust the tension.  So I went ahead and bought one for use with my Blue Yeti Nano.When it arrived I cranked down the spring tension (lowered it) as much as I could and I still had a problem with the Blue Yeti Nano creeping up even though I had tightened the articulated arms as much as I could.  I was considering returning it for a 2 days until my Radius III Shock Mount arrived and I installed it.  The combination of the extra weight from the shock mount and the extra 1-2" that the shock mount moved my microphone away from the arm it now works perfectly.So my bottom line is this arm is a definite 5 Star product PROVIDED your microphone is heavy enough.  However if you are wanting to put something lighter weight than a Nano with Shock Mount I would avoid this boom arm and go with something cheaper.
3,The look and feel of the arm is great as well as the cable management trough and desk mount. It’s very sturdy when mounted and swivels easily and smoothly. HOWEVER the springs are entirely too strong; even with the adjustment screw loosened and the elbow tightened so much that my fingers hurt the arm springs back up sending my mic to the moon where my voice projection isn’t. Instead of returning I hung a 5 pound weight on the arm for two weeks while I was away for work and that worked for me but if you can’t do that I wouldn’t recommend this arm. Other than that it’s great.
2,When I first got this mic arm I turned all 3 dials very far right so that it wouldn't move after I put the mic in front of my face. The bottom dial didn't move and the closest dial that holds the mic didn't move either. However the middle dial would not stay still. Whenever I moved it down a little bit it would slowly move up until it was literally right in front of my mouth which is really annoying. Today 6 months after my original purchase I got tired of this. I got a wrench and tightened the middle dial much farther right. I've already done this in the past but it didn't help. At some point the arm started to become looser. I only moved it ~720 degrees and then the part that you hold to turn the dial broke off and now it just springs all the way up with no sturdiness at all. You could say that it is my fault for making it so tight but the thing is that the mic arm should be able to stay stable at the point that you want it to be especially for $80+.
5,I’m a huge fan of the side dials to adjust tension on the arm joints. Overall it’s a good arm and will hold an AT2020 or a Shure PG42. Better than any cheap arm you can get and equivalent to the rode mic arm.
5,This is the best looking mic boom arm in my opinion.  It functions as it should and I like the cable management system which hides the cable for that clean look.  Adjustments are smooth quiet and easy.  The original Blue mic mount was taking up valuable desk real estate and the reason I got the boom arm.  I have no complaints and the price was not bad for a quality you get.  I would recommend the blue compass to anyone.
3,The Yeti Compass certainly has its quirks1) It’s very stiff even after adjusting the tension2) It’s quite heavy - something to be wary of if you’re nearing your desk’s weight limit3) The included screw doesn’t even fit a Blue Yeti - the microphone used in all its marketing material! (This is more a Yeti problem than a Compass problem.)4) Cable management is made easy! Provided you have the perfect length thin cable…5) Support is useless if you run into a problem. Wait 1 week for an answer to somebody else’s question and then another week for them to ask for clarification about what your original question asked. By comparison Reddit asynchronously solved my problem (quirk #3) in 6 hours.That said the build quality is phenomenal. It’s sturdy and as good looking as a microphone stand can be. The included mount does its job perfectly. The movement is incredibly smooth.The fact is though this is a $100 arm that has too many negatives for the price. I don’t see anything in particular that blows it away compared to arms at half price. If you don’t mind throwing away money it’s a great option. If you’re frugal look elsewhere.
4,Well made out of good quality materials. Tension is initially quite stiff but can be adjusted. The one design shortcoming is that the knobs to tighten the joints are a bit small and hard to grip. If you have a heavy mic and really want to tighten the joints it be tough to get it as tight as you want.
5,The design functions against gravity which is genius. What I mean by that is that if you untighten the clamps the boom arm will go up instead of down so you will never have to worry about it falling and damaging your expensive mic.It swivels around very easily once mounted. Setup was super easy took it out of the box and mounted it in like 5 minutes not even. A bit pricey for a piece of plastic at least I think so but the quality is most certainly there. It tightens onto my desk very well I'm confident it will stay there until I untighten the clamp.One thing the articulation points are very stubborn if you go to the gym it probably won't be an issue for you but if you don't get out much it could be hard to bend it into the place you need. Another thing about that I don't recommend bending the boom arm while it is mounted which can be a little frustrating in terms of positioning.I hope this helps you make a decision.
4,So I WAS using an InnoGear boom that ultra-budget one. But as I was upgrading my setup I just figured "████ it let's go all in." That's how I ended up with this boom arm and the Blue Companion shock mount. Here's a few pointers.• It's sturdy. There's literally nothing about its durability or built quality that would make mes econd guess it.• It holds its weight. I've seen some reviews say it buckles under the weight of their setup. I have a shock mount and Blue Yeti on mine. Did they not realize they can tighten each joint?• It's expensive. Honestly I don't think this worth the $100 price tag. If I paid what I felt that it was worth I'd pay $60. My gas spring monitor stand has better build quality and is 100% more premium feeling and only cost me $39. There's nothing about this that makes me feel that it warrants the price.tl;dr: It's a great boom arm. It's an insanely overly priced boom arm. My last $20 boom arm had about the same functionality it just looked way uglier. You're paying $80 for aesthetics but if you're game for that this earns an A+ in that department.
5,Awesome quality and easy to set up. It has a good reach if mounted at the rear of a wide desk. I tried it in a lot of different positions around my set up and it worked in them all.
3,If you receive this item and it is extremely difficult to bend into place then does not stay into place. You have a defective arm. I had to return my original arm after wrestling with it for almost 2 hours. When I received the new arm the tension was set correctly and it worked out of the box without hassle. Giving 3 stars since this seems to be an issue the company is aware of. These arms leave the factory with too much tension sometimes.
3,It looks nice. Mine is holding an Audio Technica mic in a vibration cage.The (internal) springs are STRONG making the elbow tension screws quite hard to use. The elbows do NOT have any sort of teeth which would fix the massive spring tension. Perhaps the springs will give a bit with use but for now it’s all I can do to keep the thing from flinging my mic like a catapult (I’m exaggerating to make a point but only a little).It comes with two stickers to explain the basics (the adjuster sticker is useful but the elbow sticker is pointless). A third sticker that it does not cone with is how you mount the cable inside. It has little plastic flip-up keeper/covers but it’s not obvious how to use them without breaking them. Long story short get a steak knife or very small fat blade screw driver and CAREFULLY pry one up/open. Long story short one end flips open (the opposite hinged end will tear/break if you go too gorilla on it. Then you have a small piece of plastic to throw in the trash and an arm that is (arguably) missing it’s single most important feature. up/open the rest will be obvious. Work carefully lest ye break the clip.The elbow tension/clamp lock screw isn’t even close to strong enough to overcome the spring force. Mine is as tight as I could muster and it STILL SLIPS. Grr...The thing looks sexy but needs some serious help in the engineering department. ...and it’s expensive.
5,For me this worked directly out of the box using a Blue Yeti Microphone. This Boom Arm was made with Blue microphone products in mind. It will work with other microphones that have the correct thread size and weight range. If it is falling down or bouncing up there is an adjustment screw at the bottom of the arm. Check your microphone against the specs and buy this only if it matches.Without a doubt this boom arm saved space on my desk and allowed me to put the microphone closer to me. No squeaking quality materials easy to install.
5,I received this stand about a week ago and am loving it. This is the very best looking stand IMO that I've ever seen. Honestly the looks are the main reason why I bought this but everything about it is top notch. It seems very sturdy thick metal not cheap looking / feeling what so ever. The base that clamps onto your desk feels like it could hold up a tank haha. It has a cable routing groove in it also to keep everything nice and tidy. I read a bunch of reviews on this before I purchased it and honestly about the only thing I read that people complained about was there either being far too much tension and the arm keeps raising up by itself or the opposite and being too little and the arm falling. If people would actually read the manual that it comes with it says that you can adjust it to suit your mic. Don't listen to those people I'm sorry but they are ignorant.... This stand is IMO perfect when you find this on sale for $80 $100 I'd say would still be worth it but 80 is perfect!
5,TLDR: Read the instructions loosen the screw at the base the arm as it says on page 2 because it comes over tightened not under loosened do not tighten the knobs on the arms restricting movement.After reading reviews and the instructions I set this up perfectly in 5 minutes. No drooping no boom arm rising to the top and I can move it with one arm. Im not superman people just didn't read the instructions and doing the opposite of that will result is unsatisfactory product. If you loosen the tension at the base and loosen or leave the knobs alone (except the top one that holds the mic you want that one tight) the arm will be able to move. I will have to agree with other users that you need a heavy mic like the yeti. Is this overpriced for what it is? Yes it is. Is there anything wrong with this blue boom Arm? No. If you have a yeti or heavy mic get this Arm it looks great and functions great.
5,I was a little nervous because all the product photos shows this being used as an overhead boom and that was not the way I wanted to use it.The tension and spring adjustments are a little weird. Haven't read the directions so I still don't know why the knobs say that you can only turn them one way but  as you can see from the pictures I'm able to get it into the positions that I need it in and it holds just fine.If like me you're using an SM7B and sE Dynamite as a preamp you're going to need the Shure A26X 3" Extension Tube or the Dynamite won't fit on the arm. Even without using the sE Dynamite I still recommend the extension or else your rotation is limited as the XLR plug hits the articulating joint above it.So far so good. I feel like it's a good value for the money and looks great. If something breaks I'll let you know.
2,I'm so disappointed to report that I'm yet another person who found the spring just way too strong.I have my Blue Yeti mic which I love and I was so excited to get the Compass boom arm. Now I did read through reviews and saw people reporting how the tension was so strong no matter what they did that they basically couldn't even use it.  I also read all the overwhelmingly positive reviews including the ones addressing the problem of the tight spring.So yes I did know all about the hidden tension setting screw in the base etc. However I have to now let people know that when you see these reviews like mine I swear to you we are not all crazy or incompetent.The top section of my Compass boom arm was so tight that it simply would not flex barely at ALL. No matter how I adjusted the tension screw or turned the knobs the stand would just straighten back out.  Out of the box it is almost like what I received was a straight unbendable stick - I'm not kidding. After some adjustments I got it so that I could maneuver it with a lot of force - into a position that might be useful but instantly it would start to straighten out again. Nothing seemed to work.I know that a LOT of people have this stand and love it and clearly haven't had this issue. In fact I have a good friend who has the Compass and loves it and when I told him about it this wasn't his experience at all.  So maybe this is just some us getting a bad unit?Once again I read all the tips I watched Youtube videos about it - NOTHING I did seemed to work to alleviate this problem.  And it is clear that I'm not alone.So I feel I have to post this just to let people know that clearly some people have having very different experiences with this stand.
3,Still struggling with understanding what I'm supposed to expect as this is my first purchase of this type of itemI like the quality of the build and feel of the material. I also like very much the simplicity of the swivel mechanism. simple and elegantwhat I don't like is the lack of clarity on how to control the main hinge of the boom arm...mine seems to have a mind of its own. I might have to return and request a new unit. the hinge at the mic works as I expected it to..same for the hinge at the swivel
1,Love it but can't use it. Even completely loosening the tension screw at the bottom it it too tight/strong even using a Blue Yeti mic.  I can't get it to stay in place. Similar to many other reviews but seems as.if mine is even worse than most. This thing could hold 5lbs or more it's so strong of a spring.It is a little disappointing in its ability to pivot in more directions. I didn't want it sit above me because I didn't want it visible in my camera. Trying to get it situated with the Yeti below my chest pointing up and angled to be able to speak into the side since the Blue Yeti doesn't have condensers on the top only along the sides. I also tried with the mic positioned horizontally but since this arm tension was SOOO STRONG I could never get it to hold.  I literally was thinking about buying some lead to wrap around the upper part of the arm or taping 2 rolls of quarters or more to add weight.  It sits on the floor of my office unused.  I should have just bought a cheap arm for half the price. I simply just use the stand that comes with the Blue Yeti and move it in front of me on my desk when in video calls.  But then can't use my keyboard easily since it sits now right in front of my keyboard.  Waste of $100.
5,I was looking for a premium mic arm and this meets my expectation.  if your mic is too heavy it will sag but still do not overtighten.  my favorite part is the bottom cylinder design base.  This is the pretty much only one that has that type of base in this price range.  Thank me later.
4,Only problem is that the thumb screws blades are fixed so if you have limited clearance on one side of the attachment point where you turn the screw the blade may hit the obstruction. Other models have adapted for this by have a bar that can slide back and forth through the screw giving you a long handle on one side and less protruding on the other.
5,This boom arm is made specifically for a yeti Blu Mic.  It's not going to work properly with other mics because they do not weigh as much.  It's not a hassle or pain to put together like some reviews are saying.  This boom arm is perfect.
2,The springs in this arm were always strong which is great if your mic is on the heavy side but they way the tensioner is designed is planned for failure. The glue gave way the knob popped off and the bolt slid out. No more tension in the middle joint. Guess I'm going to find a real solution at home depot. Just sad because I like this system better than it's competitors due to it not having an internal mic cable. Guess I will pick up a Gator next time. https://www.amazon.com/Gator-Frameworks-Desk-Mounted-Microphone-GFWBCBM3000/dp/B082YHPC3Z
4,I neither found it easy nor straightforward to adjust the positioning of the boom arm to my liking. Getting the tension right needs a lot of trial and error that always makes me feel that my blue yeti is not sturdy and is ready to take a plunge at any minute! The Radius III is probably also partially to blame. It's probably just me not being able to adjust the arm and radius properly but if it was easy to do I would've been able to easily do it!
2,So many people use this mount I figured it HAD to be good! Nope. The joint broke while I was setting it up! It's so difficult to turn to tighten the thing and unless you have a beefy microphone the stand will not stay in place. It constantly went up into the straight position. You'd think that for $100 they would have had a better design with a better tightening system! Also if you have big hands as I do good luck using the plastic tightening points! I could barely fit my fingers in there and couldn't get a good grip at all.I would only recommend this if you had a really heavy mic to counterbalance the arm. Maybe an SM7B or something but if your mic is not heavy this will not work at all.
2,After a few months of perfectly fine use the middle joint suddenly broke and stopped supporting the mic I was using (it was fine before). Unsure what to do from here other than just buying a different one or replacing this one.
5,I was a bit worried when other reviewers said the tension was out of whack and tightening the plastic knobs at the joints wasn't enough however I found a different review that indicated that's not what the knobs are meant to do. There is a tension control at the base of the arm and it was as easy as just reading the instructions that come with the arm to figure that out.The arm looks very high quality and great on my desk. It's rock solid and it's super easy to adjust my Yeti Nano (up down swing it sideways etc). I'm using it with a shock mount with a thread adapter so you'll need some sort of adapter if you want to use it with the Nano.The cable channels are great to make your set up look even cleaner than before and they're a great addition to an already great stand.
3,After a lot of ready bought the blue compass. I mounted a RE27 on it and to keep it in place you need it pretty tight at the joints. But to move it up and down takes two hands. The mount is good and the swivel is fine. But it’s not a pro type mounts by any stretch just ok.
2,I've had mine for about a year and can say that I should have bought a different boom arm.  I'm sure it is callibrated for a blue yeti but I upgraded to a audio technica 2035.  This thing has been a pain in the genitals in regards to positioning.  you can adjust the first hinge at the base.  after that you might want to attach weights? with your mic.  I actually broke the tightening screw as it was a metal screw attached to a plastic plate and I tightened it so much that the screw pulled away from the plate.  There is no other way of adjusting the second hinge.  should be ok if you have the mic above your head but to have it infront of your face you'd need to have enough space to let the second hinge extend out but that kinda defeats the purpose of this thing doesn't it?Otherwise the other materials are pretty sturdy and clean looking which is why I gave it 2 instead of 1 stars.  also the customer service that straight up gave me a replacement arm for free which was nice but now I have 2 of these things that I'd rather not deal with.  Also I fixed the screw and plate with super glue in copious amounts.other reviews are disingenuous about the adjustment feature as it only effects the first hinge at the base otherwise this thing wants to give you an uppercut right in the kisser.I'm probably getting fed up and will buy a different boom arm that let's me position my mic where I want it.Unless you have a Blue Yeti mic... don't buy this.
4,LOVE this Arm. I had one of the cheaper arms built off a lamp arm. This is PRO-SUMER grade. Fantastic positioning built like a tank. Now I can stretch out my mic and place it inches from my face no more echos you could pay 200.00 but WHY just do it!
5,So glad I purchased this! It is great with my Mic!
5,I'm not going to lie I decided to go with this stand because I really liked the clean look. I'm using a Yeti X mic. Many of the reviews talk about the springs being too tight I will say out of the box they seemed a bit tight however once I got my mic on there I felt it was just right. I really like the smooth swivel action on the base so I can swing it out of the way easily when not using it. Also like that it literally will just lift out of the base if you needed to take off quickly. Looks great too no open springs or anything. If my mic was any lighter I'm sure I'd have to adjust the spring tension. I haven't tried it but many of the reviews talk about cranking down on the joints to lock it into place from springing up. Not sure if they knew that there is a spring adjustment for tension in the bottom of the stand that was described in the instructions. Again I haven't had to adjust it but I'd give that a shot if you have issues.
3,This is a nice looking boom stand and generally works well. I wish the pivot points would articulate more in both directions and don’t really get why they can’t. The rotation point on the bottom in particular would be better if it could go back at all but it only turns forward. This limits your ability to move the mic away
3,The arm will not hold the position I need it to stay in. I've tightend down the pivot points as hard as I can using hand force yet the mic still creeps up vertically. I have a yeti x with a shock mount.In addition to this aggrivating issue the materials also feel cheap. I expected solid metal or thick plastic. Instead of this I got thin bendable plastic that im worried about breaking.Not impressed.
2,This is a very sturdy microphone stand. This stand feels solid and the cable management is actually pretty good.Unfortunately the friction joints that are meant to hold the microphone stand in place actually don't even at their tightest setting. I even tried adding a piece of rubber to the joint for more friction to no avail the stand simply won't stay in place. Some reviews say that you need a heavy microphone for this stand but I am using a Blue Yeti Nano and this is literally the recommended microphone stand on their website. I suppose I could strap a 5lb dumbbell to the stand but at 100 USD I expected a product that would simply work AND look clean when I pull it out of the box.
4,I have had the Blue Compass premium tube arm in my sure to buy wishlist for quite some time. In fact I own two. Each of them are assembled and match one another with little variances noticeable.The quality of materials is superior to the cheaper alternatives you would expect to be attached to a sub ten dollar desk lamp. The mechanism to tighten or loosen the adjustment tension bolt is made from seemingly ABS plastic and is the “cheapest” part to me.Overall great item but the tension is not as predictable or stable as whAt you would experience on a mid-range monitor arm mount.The overall articulation of the tube arm is minimal but available. If you’re looking for a stable static placement stand this is a wonderful choice.Also this DOES not fit nor come with the appropriate thread or diameter adapter to attach to a Blue Yeti Pro USB.
5,Once you set the tension properly this arm has smooth rotation and stays exactly where you put it. Being able to manage the cabling in the tubing is clean and attractive.  Also looks great on camera.  I use it with a Rode Procaster mic and it handles it beautifully.  Can’t recommend enough!
3,I received the stand and it’s super difficult to adjust. The quality seems to be somewhat up there. I just thinks there’s better options out there.
2,First the good:1.  I really like the sleek nice clean look2.  Easy to install3.  The mount does feel like a quality buildThe bad:1.  The tension is way too much.  Every time I have my mic where I want it the arms raises slowly until it's too far away.  No adjustment will fix this because there is just too much tension when you have the arm lowered.  If you plan on having this boom out all  the way then this will probably work for you.  Unfortunately it doesn't work well with my setup.In the future it would be nice if the tension was adjustable for all setups.  Just a minor oversight in a otherwise good product but with my setup it's an unusable flaw.
1,This boom arm was designed by someone with an aesthetic goal in mind first and engineering second. This becomes obvious when you try to mount a microphone with a lighter weight than something like a blue yeti as the weight will counteract some of the tension by weighing down the end. With less weight at the end to counter the arm's tension the bend in the middle will continuously fight where you set it trying to bend further upwards. To try and counteract this you can tighten the middle section more but you might find that it does not fix it. This leads to the problem with the design.The main problem is the way which the tension is actually applied. On the inside there is a metal wire running the length of the stand with a spring on one or both ends to make sure the wire does not snap. There is a tensioning screw at the bottom which should relax or tighten this spring so you can more easily adjust but this only relaxes the tension a small amount. The finger screws on the bottom and middle joints simply tighten the joints until the friction from the joint no longer allows them to move. This should be able to do the job but the parts which actually apply this friction are all plastic. There is a metal screw interfaced with a metal nut but the way you turn this screw as well as the part which actually squeezes the two halves together is plastic. Once the screw gets tight enough to actually apply very much friction to the two smooth sides of the joint it begins to pull itself through the plastic bits until it no longer is applying any friction at all and you now have a broken microphone arm.This design flaw could easily be fixed with either better overall adjustment in the tension of the wire or by using all metal parts on the joint so you can properly apply the friction required. With the current design you end up with a very pretty arm which will not allow you to set it exactly how you want it without damaging it.
3,This mic arm is awesome in terms of construction and quality. However the adjustment dials don't have enough friction built into them to overcome the spring mechanism in the arm. So you get it to the right position tighten the adjustment dials as hard as they can go and the springs in the arm make it drift up slowly. The manufacturer needs to give the adjustment dials more strength to hold the current position.Too bad because otherwise it's a well-built piece of equipment... but what good is a mic arm when you can't keep it in position?
4,I looked at like 20 microphone arms and this was clearly the best one based on specs and looks. After installing it I am very happy with it except for one design flaw which is that the thing you turn to tighten the C clamp is too wide so if your desk does not have a big lip you cannot fully tighten the C clamp. There is a work around for this by drilling a hole into your desk and installing the arm without the clamp.
3,It will hit certain tension points and want to spring back regardless how much it's tightened. Also the positioning isn't quite as versatile as I would've liked. It does look clean though so if you do find a position it will maintain it looks good and is sturdy.
2,I bought one of these for my Shure MV-7 and it would not stay in place without excessively cranking down on the knobs on the elbows. I contacted Blue/Logitech and they sent a replacement. Same issue. I contacted them again and they once again replaced it. Same issue.I just bought the shock mount for the MV-7 hoping it would add enough weight. It still rises due to the springs in the unit being too strong. I've removed the tension screw so that it has the least amount of spring tension. I don't think the tension screw affects the middle elbow at all maybe just the elbow at the base.Nevertheless if you have a microphone that weighs less than 2 pounds then I would advise not getting this boom arm. I've not tried the other boom arms that look like variations of this one but I'm going to assume that they have the same issue. It's too bad. I like the design and general construction of this boom arm but it's not usable to me.
1,I was really hype to be getting a boom Mic.  The later reviews had me scared and I wish I had listen to my gut.  So first day off the back I notice something wrong in the middle.  I thought I saw a crack. This boom mic couldn't hold my mic at all.  Kept falling down due to weight.  When it was able to manage to hold the weight half way thru a gaming session the arm would fall down due to weight.  So I would have to readjust the arm again.  Well today during a session the arm fell down again.  I tight the middle and saw a for sure crack down the bottom of the middle of the arm.  The middle of where you are suppose to tighten the spring completely fell apart on me.  It was embarrassing because I was in the middle of a game play while It happen with friends.  Worst thing ever and I hardly write reviews.  Shows you how much I dislike this product.  Now I go back and see all the recent reviews on this.  This product didn't even last a week.
5,I never write reviews but I felt the need to write this as I was almost on the verge of returning this stand because I could not for the life of me figure out how to get the mic to stay in a position. Turns out it's so advanced that it only moves exactly how you want it to when it has a weight to counterbalance it on the end (i.e. the mic and shock mount). Once I attached the mic and shock mount to the end of the mic stand it was effortless to move. Perfect mic stand.
5,If you want a quality boom arm buy this asap! Nothing is going to beat this. Yes it’s tedious to setup and get right but once you get it how you want you cannot say this isn’t an amazing arm. I don’t see this breaking anytime soon!
4,Great boom.  Great build.  Cable groove is a nice touch.  I have a very wide desk which means the boom arm is extended about 3 ft from its base.  At this "reach" it seems the SM7B is about the limit this arm would support.  That's just physics but thought it would be worth mentioning.
1,What were they thinking?  Did they test this mic boom with an anvil instead of a normal mic?  The springs that balance the position of the arm are SO INCREDIBLY STRONG that it is a physical impossibility for me to tighten down the brackets to create enough friction to create a stable neutral configuration that holds the mic in place.  I tightened it beyond what I  thought was possible without breaking the damn thing and the boom arm still extends and raises up.  I simply cannot crank the knobs down tight enough so that it simply holds the mic in place where I want it.  BTW I am using an MXL 770 which I think is a fairly heavy mic to begin with.It's just absurd.  I mean seriously what were they thinking when they designed this thing.  The usability is absolute garbage and my fingers are genuinely sore and throbbing after trying to simply balance this boom arm so that the mic stays where I want it. I am supremely disappointed.One other thing... the point where the mic attaches to the boom... once you tighten it down there's no way to freely rotate the mic along it's axis!  There is a locking nut that tightens against your mic to hold it in place and once that is done there's no way to adjust it.  So if your mic is slightly off kilter and needs to be realigned you have to completely loosen it and try again.  It requires trial and error to get the mic to be aligned straight up and down. And once you tighten it down there no way to just reach up and adjust it without completely loosening it again.  I mean really?  $100 and this is what we get?  Nothanks.  I can't return this thing fast enough.  It's absolute garbage and I cannot understand how anyone could give this a good review.The only thing positive about it is the looks.  And I guess that is a reflection on our society more than it is the functionality and usefulness of the item.
5,This thing is SOLID!  A beautiful and functional stand in every regard.  First and foremost it does a great job of holding a mic.  I've got my large and heavy Audio Technica BP40 dynamic mic mounted and the stand required not a single adjustment out of the box; the mic stays in place perfectly with no arm rise.  The stand is solidly built out of quality materials that feel substantial and has a nice touch.  Mounting the stand to a point of usability took less than 30 seconds and was completely intuitive.  The boom moves out of the way when not in use and is easy to pull into use in just a matter of seconds.  It looks great on my desk and complements my desk nicely.  At less than $100 this thing is a bargain and value by any definition.  I am absolutely thrilled with this purchase and this continues to reinforce why I am a 10-year-plus customer of Blue products; absolutely solid quality and seemingly much more for your hard-earned money.  Five stars -- easy.
4,Really great product almost earns itself 5 stars but there is only one flaw in my opinion. The tube system works with heavier mics like the original blue yeti very well however smaller mics have trouble keeping the arm down and no matter how I try to change the tension there's always a bit of lift on the arm until it catches it's sitting position. Other than that the arm is amazing. It turns every which way can be adjusted in many different positions the cable management tracks are awesome and not having the clanking metal arm like before is really nice on the aesthetic.
2,I just spent two and a half hours trying to set this thing up without much luck. The rest 200+ critical reviews here are correct: the spring is too strong. I loosened the tension screw at the bottom of the arm to the most loose position tightened the middle pivot joint to maximum tightness put two pounds of weight at the end but the middle joint still springs back up. I watched several review videos on YouTube (including the "It works if used properly" one which someone spammed here in the comments under every critical review) in the attempt to figure out what's wrong with my item. It seems that in every positive review the spring in the arm is much looser: it literally takes two or three turns of the middle joint to make it stay in place with almost no weight attached. On the other hand arms in the critical reviews show much more spring strength especially at the middle joint. So it's either something changed in the design of this arm or Blue just has some quality control issues.For now I attached it to the farthest side of the table and lowered the height using the bottom pivot joint so it literally spans across the half of my table. I tightened the middle joint to the maximum and was able to set it to about 140-150 degrees (which is nowhere near 90 degrees suggested as a starting point in the manual). So I basically use it as an almost straight long stick which can bend at the bottom. Obviously it is far from perfect but I'll try to use it in this mode for the next couple weeks to see if it is bearable or not before returning it.
1,Let me first say that of all the microphone booms I've checked out the quality of the materials used with this product are well above average and look great.However there are a few crucial flaws that really disappointed me after installing on my desk.First note that the internal spring mechanism used to counterbalance the weight of the mic once attached is much too powerful for common studio mics. I use an AudioTechnica AT2020 (a fairly weighty mic) but after repeated attempts to keep the mic in front of my face and close to my voice it simply would not stay in position. I tried as the instructions suggest to relax the spring tension by turning the adjustment screw at the base of the arm pivot but to no avail. I also tightened the set knobs at each section of the arm as tight as I could but just could not keep the arm in position. In frustration I even tried to tighten the set knobs with a pair of pliers which didn't work either and eventually broke the plastic knobs which unfortunately are not very well reinforced and could be significantly improved by making them out of aluminum or brass. I found it baffling that the use of high quality metals/materials in other areas was common but on the areas where adjustment was important and would be frequent and necessary they choose plastic.I then thought that maybe I'd received a defective product and since I'd broken (and disassembled) the first one in sheer frustration I ordered a second arm.No change. The same excessive spring tension no matter what I tried. (It's going back.)Conclusion: If your mic is big and heavy...you're probably in good shape. But if your mic is of average weight like mine you'd better think twice...or order a couple of barbells and some duct tape to keep your mic in front of you.
2,Don’t buy this stand unless you plan on having the microphone from the top down.I have a smaller desk ~4ft across and I need the microphone arm at an acute 80 degree angle (ish). However the friction joins don’t tighten enough to hold that position…the top elbow joint slowly comes back to a 90 free angle and no matter how much I tighten the side it won’t stay (not even with pliers tightened)I found an extra screw from a prebuilt furniture piece that I have threaded into the bolt slot treat fits perfectly and I wrenched it down and now it holds its position but there’s no way the default hardware could have stood up to this.I will be returning this and looking for a stronger joint arm maybe the RODE mic mount.
4,I liked that it is a well made and robust product. I not fond of how difficult it was to turn adjuster wheels. I wouldn't recommend this product to someone with "soft" hands. Very sturdy I wish it telescoped just about 6-12" further than its fixed length and it would be useful if the head (or the tip of where it connects to the microphone) angled up to 45deg. These problems may be solved if you aren't using the snowball. Worth every penny never the less. I am just using it to chat with friends.
5,This product is great. It looks professional and works as intended. It is sturdy and has multiple adjustment points. I have not had any issues and really love it. Although I do not understand why it’s so expensive. I have many friends who have similar products which are not labeled with the blue name. There’s were only a fraction of the cost. And they work just as well as mine. I just bought it because I had the money to spend and wanted to see the difference. I think if you can get away with another one for cheaper it is probably the better bet. But if you have the money to spend why not grab this. It’s a great product.
5,What you’re getting out of this product is mainly it’s sturdiness and it’s more sleek appearance in contrast to other microphone stands out there. It’s very well made and will definitely give your set up a nicer touch. I would recommend this to individuals looking for an upgrade over a previous mic stand.
5,As of May 2019 this is arguably the best looking boom arm on the market. It looks better in person than any picture or video can show. The desk mount is very sleek and modern giving it style but allowing it to do its job - being a secure sturdy mount. The hinges are well designed as well as the cable management slot is a thought out idea it's not just Velcro tie downs. It can support mic's (w/ or w/o shock mounts) that weigh more than the advertised 2.4 lbs. The only downfall to this boom arm is the tighten rods have a plastic cap so you'll feel like you're going to break something if you go too tight BUT there is a design feature built in to help with that. There is a tension screw on the bottom (next to the pivot rod) of the arms base that allows for spring tension adjustment. You can find out how to adjust the springs tension via the owners manual.TLDR; Very good design making it the best looking boom arm on the market. Most negative reviews are due to a strong spring tension but that can be adjusted via a design feature on the arms base.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!  I purchased a the Blue Yeti and wanted a boom to position it off cam while keeping it effective.  So I purchased this thing because it was the same brand figured it would be ideal to work with the mic I purchased.  And while that may be true I will not know because the boom is a total piece of inoperable trash.  There are springs in the arms I assume to keep tension tight the problem is the springs are so stiff that the lock screws do not hold.  How could this possibly have gone out for production?  No quality standards at all.  The tension is so stiff that I tightened the lock screws with a wrench.  It's supposed to be a hand-twist lock but the arms do not stay in place on hand tightening alone.  When I used the wrench it still shifted position but stayed at least somewhat in the place I wanted it or at least as much that I was willing to shrug it and do the best I could with what I could get out of it.  The next morning I woke up the ultra stiff tension had actually almost completely straightened the arms WAY out of position I had to do it all over again.  Then since I bought this stupid thing I figured let me try again.  Next day same thing.  So I try again and again same result each morning.  I thought maybe I just have to keep working the springs to loosen the tension.  Nope.  This thing is so horribly designed so ill conceived that it is simply not usable.  The waste of money is one thing the time effort and frustration is even worse.  I just can't believe that this awful design would have ever made it through proof of concept and into production.  I no longer trust Blue products and will not be doing business with this brand going forward.
4,I use this boom arm in my Voice-over booth. It preforms pretty well.  The only draw backs I have noticed are1) the tubes are so substantial I was unable to clamp a Stedman pop filter to it which I rectified by using a telefunken that mounts directly onto the microphone.2) the arm is heavy enough to pivot on its own where the base meets the desk clamp. I rectified this by placing two 1/2” x 2”  Neoprene washers (purchased at home depot  $1.36 each) at the junction of the base and arm assemblies.
2,From day 1 I had issues with the tension. The cable that runs through it is simply too short and the adjustable pivot screws can not hold it. I was able to get it to hold just enough that I got about 10 degrees of angle on the mid-boom pivot. No where near the 90 it says to position it at. This left me with limited options on where to put the mount. By the way in order to get it to hold at all I had to use a pair of pliers to twist the knob because I wanted it as tight as I could get it without breaking it. After "dealing" with this thing for over a year I finally tried to move it and get it to adjust better and of course I broke the knob on the mid-boom pivot. Now it is worthless. I can clearly see now at least the cable and the fact that it is WAY too tight. Again the tension screw in the base is COMPLETELY removed so it's as loose as it could be. I wish I had known better from the beginning and just returned it immediately but I wanted to get started with my project so I just made do. Very crappy product. I now have $100 poking stick.If it was made better it would be awesome. Just a little MORE cable please!! Surely that would not impact your bottom line that much. I'm sure some accountant decided it would save a few cents per item and that would get them a promotion. Good job. Your product is crap now.
2,I have a Blue Yeti and I love everything about the mic from build quality to sound I kept Blue in high regards when it came to their products. However giving this Blue Compass a shot that high regard isn't really there anymore.I've been using a $20 boom arm I got a while back from Amazon and it worked ok at best it held the mic but felt cheap and it didn't have anyway to hide the cable of the mic. The Compass looked like a fantastic upgrade and for 5 times the price I'd hope it would be.Unboxing and setting the arm up was easy and I love the look and feel of the arm it feels solid and the cable routing is ace. Getting it attached to my desk routing the cable and screwing on the mic was no problem and I was hoping I would be good to go. The problem lies within the knobs to adjust the tension points of the three points one just doesn't work as it should. I don't know what kind of spring is in my middle joint but I'm sure you could use it in your car's suspension to great result because this thing is resilient. For lighter mics you're supposed to be able to tighten it to the right so that the arm doesn't spring up by itself and you can easily adjust it but my fingers are in literal pain right now because I'm trying to purposefully overtighten it and keep the mic down. Now matter how much I tighten this specific joint the boom arm is slowly stiffening up by itself and rising to the occasion like a horse in heat.I might have to use pliers but I'm pretty sure I'm going to break it before it starts doing what it's supposed to because the tightening knob is plastic.I'm sorely disappointed in this purchase and I'm probably going to return it once it's all said and done if I can't fix it myself. Caveat emptor.
2,I have to use this arm straight under my face with the mic pointing up.  No matter what I do with the two tension/adjustment points it will not stay in place (bent at the middle joint). If feels like if I had a 30lb mic it would work but not with an actual mic.  It just doesn’t weight enough to keep the arm bent. I have loosened and tightened both adjustments as far as they will go without any change.This would be a five star review if it wasn’t for this.
5,Look I know why you're here. You want to be a streamer or need to do some desk level production to up that zoom sound quality. I get it. You don't want to have the same mic boom as everyone else and this is probably just the product for you.Kidding aside this is a great product with one flaw that I'm not thrilled about but get by.The tension on this mic stand is hiiiigh. Anything that weighs less than a Shure SM7B isn't going to work well with it that being said...as long as you're looking to use a studio grade microphone have at it! Beautiful clean quiet.If you're going with a non studio mic I'd look elsewhere.
5,After going through  my second "Neewer" type mic arm I decided to get a good quality arm that will last a long time and that I won't have to replace every 8 months. This mic arm is very sturdy and looks great. It's easy to setup and clamped onto my desk with ease. I am able to position it exactly where I need it and having it show in the webcam video while I'm streaming isn't bad because it looks so good. I'm using it with an Audio Technica AT2020 so you don't HAVE to be using a Blue Mic with this arm. I love how it hides the XLR cable that runs from my mic to my USB interface and is just cleans up the whole deal that much more. Before I had to zip tie the cable to the Neewer arms. This is great and definitely think you should pick it up if you're in the market for a mic arm.  I think this arm looks better than the RODE PSA1 arm and I like it a lot.  The joint tensioners are easy to use but do require some strength to get as tight as they can be. Great arm and I give it 5 stars.
4,I was reluctant to buy this after seeing all of the bad reviews but after some use I can clearly see that it's a very well built product and it makes my setup look cleaner. I needed this in order to reach my face from further away and it is large enough to cover the distance across my desk while keeping itself sturdy enough to not shake all over the place. That being said the price is a bit much for a boom arm but it's still a quality product none the less.
5,I really like the closed piping of the Blue stand versus the other open scissor-style. The tube/piping looks and feels like solid construction. I’ve got this mounted on a standing desk and the clamp provides a solid mounting.
5,I use a large flat door as a desktop.  This arm reaches from the back all the way over my monitor and can even stretch a bit to my face.  Other arms I've tried were too small and hard to move around.  This one has a nice clean appearance and a great reach.  Cables hide nicely too.  My Audiotechnica mic screwed right into the end without adapters.  Very happy.
5,Just a great overall arm
4,Even at the lowest adjusted strength it has a mind of its own. If you’ve got a heavy mic I’m sure it’s perfect. With a Shure MV7 it’s very particular about certain positions and angles. Thankfully I could mount it to a shelf that’s a foot lower than my desk otherwise I’d have struggled to use it. Otherwise it’s perfect.
5,Look no further. Professional Quality Boom at a great price. Everything is sturdy and well made. The table mount is stout. Don’t bother continuing to compare this one is “the one”. All the cabling is internal/hidden. The spring joints are strong and can easily be tightened to retain memory after being moved around. Ours get used every single day since distance learning and is now used while gaming streaming and everything else done online. My high school kid does not treat it with love and gentle care. It has stood up to use/abuse with zero problems. He has also moved it to different locations on his desks a dozen times. The  desk mount is still primo.  You will be happy you chose this one.
3,I bought the boom arm from seeing several reviews I even watched a few videos on setting it up and actually read the manually of all things and my light mic would keep drifting up still debating on returning but for now 2 American Locks Series 5200 are weighting it down enough for it to be stable the locks weight 10oz each.  I do like the looks of it and eventually may get a heavier mic down the road.  The adjustment tensioners are just not good enough for lighter mics.  Mic and locks weigh around 2 1/2 lbs but I may be able to drop some weight with a bit more fine tuning have to go get some fishing weights from storage.
5,I love this item I ended up buying two! Now I do have to say the second didn’t work as good as the first one but wasn’t that big of an issue as I did not return it for a exchange. I would like to see them change how you tighten the knobs to hold it in place as it can be a bit difficult but other than that it’s a great product would buy again and recommend to anyone. But as I said the second one I bought did not stay in place very well so I got it to a comfortable height and had to tighten it to the extreme which felt broken and had to use a tool because it was so hard and uncomfortable to turn but I made it work and sure it was just a faulty one. Like I said didn’t bother me to the point I needed to return it so I was happy with the product still. Also it keeps desk thumping quieter and doesn’t echo through your mic as much of you were to have it on your desk stand. Great product once again
5,I have been working from home for a while now and had the Blue Yeti for the daily calls I'm on.  Loved the microphone but I didn't like it on my desk in front of the monitors.  I bought the Blue boom arm and the Blue Radius III radial shock mount.  The Microphone is now mounted to the back corner of the corner desk and is suspended over the top of the monitors.  Easy to move and position and is out of the way.  The boom arm has been absolutely bullet proof with great build and easy setup.
5,Everything was to perfection as to expect from Blue! Best mic arm on the market
3,...it just won't stay put! The spring tension in the arm is so strong that it continues to rise and won't stay in the position I move it to. Others have reported this to be true but since I'm working with a super heavy RE320 I thought that this arm would be a good choice. Sadly it's not useable if it won't stay in the position I place it. It's a shame because the build quality is AMAZING! So sleek and modern but alas if Blue can fix the adjustability of the arm and the overachieving spring I would repurchase in a heartbeat.
5,I have a blue snowball with shock mount on this and no joke the springs lift the whole thing up if you don't tighten it down. Operates very smoothly with no noise and looks super clean on a desk.While a bit pricey if you have one of the cheap spring showing versions you should strongly consider upgrading as this thing makes your desk feel like a radio booth. I love that during gaming or Skype calls I can pull the mic exactly where I want and constantly receive compliments about how clear everything sounds.
1,Here's the deal:  This doesn't work...period.  I know I know there's an adjustment screw at the base for tension.  It doesn't work!  At least not good enough...  I have it as loose as it will go without falling out and it still shoots the arm straight upwards.  I really think this screw is only for the bottom pivot point tension (near the base).  The problem is the middle pivot point which must be fixed tension without ability to adjust.  The tension is so strong (even with a very heavy Beyerdynamics mic) that it just slowly goes up with the tension knobs (the three other places to tighten the arm - bottom middle and near mic) as tight as it will go without breaking.  It will shoot up very fast if you don't have it tight.  I really think this is meant specifically for the blue mics that point downward which would place the arm almost above your head.  They say it works for any mic with the correct threading but I don't think that's the case.  You can even watch YouTubers rave about this (most likely paid by Blue) yet you can see them struggle to keep the arm down as they say how good it is.  It would be amazing if they could get this fixed but it just doesn't work.  It's made very well (5-stars) plastic knob adjustments (3-stars) and I think the value is good @ $99 (5-stars) but they have some work to do to get the tension fixed (overall 1-star).  Trust me go with the Rode PSA1 if you can find it.  It stays exactly where you want it right out of the box.  It's not as pretty but after fighting with this arm I'm going function over form...
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love this mount a lot. It sits high so your average stand vs this is a huge high difference good mount but do need a extend piece for the mount
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Out of the box the tension was perfect for the Shure SM7b microphone. I do wish it was a little taller and just a bit longer so I can place it at the back of the desk behind my iMac. As you can see in my video the arm went where I wanted it to go and I don't think it transmitted any more sound that my Rode PSA1 did.If you want to go for a higher quality microphone arm you can search for the Yellowtec Mika series. It does come in different sizes but for 3 times the price!I would say that the RODE PSA1 is a little easier to use out of the box since there are no tension knobs to adjust compared to this Blue Compass. But the Rode PSA1 looks like every other cheap scissor arm unfortunately. I'll keep it to use as an iPhone camera mount so I don't have to hold it like I did in the video!
5,This stand is great.  It holds my setup which was normally way to heavy for other stands.  Also it does not change position over time.  Once set you are good to go.  The base in inset with the table so it does not get loose like the other arms I have owned.  It hides the cord as well. The spring is strong so be careful to not let go of the unit without weight as it will fling open.  That said once the mic is on I have not had any issues.  Overall a really great product!
2,I bought one of these installed it and attached my Blue Yeti mic.  I tightened the middle hinge as far as I could by hand and the mic was still too heavy.  I used pliers to tighten even further and some tiny plastic tabs in the hinge broke rendering the entire thing useless.  I was surprised that the entire ability to tighten this otherwise-well-constructed mic arm could be defeated by a pair of two-millimeter tabs.So I bought another this time being careful to not overtighten.  Still wouldn't hold a Yeti in place.  I returned both and am going with another solution.
5,I like it’s sturdiness and it’s tautness when it comes to holding mics. It could probably hold 3 shure Smb7s with little problem. It also has a nice inset and closers for a cord to go down the spine.That being said the knobs are plastic and certain elements of it are plastic such as the cord fasteners. So I expect if you’re overly rough with it it can break pretty easily.All in all I like the solid design it has (I.e. no fingers getting smashed or pinched) and recommend it.
2,I like the tube design since I know I'll pinch my fingers on other boom arms on the market.  But the tension on this arm is so strong that no matter what adjustments I make the arm always springs back up.  I can't seem to get it to stay in the spot that I want.  The tension adjustment at the bottom is completely useless btw. I've pretty much taken the screw off and it doesn't help to alleviate the tension.One positive thing is that if you want the mic to be above you that's really the only place the arm stays.  though I can't adjust it to be in the sweet spot that i want it to be even above me.Overall not a great product for the price you are paying.
5,Watch some Joe Rogan Experience videos and you will see a nice mic setup with an arm like this and some Shure SM7B's or whatever. This mic arm was clearly modeled after that one made for the folks who look at that podcast and say "I want that setup on a budget!."Cue Critical Role's spinoff podcast All Work No Play. If it's good enough for Sam Riegel and Liam O'Brien it's good enough for me.Real world adjusting spring tension can be frustrating but if you do it correctly you only have to do it once. The clips that hold the cables in the channels are also flimsy plastic they may break off if you constantly use them or are rough with them. That being said at 1/3rd the price of the ones that have cables built in I'd argue you're still ahead.
1,I've purchased two--yes two--of these and they both broke. Well technically the second was a replacement for the first. The boom arm was used for a Shure SM7B microphone. The boom arm looks high quality but the materials themselves not so much.To start the adjuster knobs are made of plastic not metal. And the part you grab on to in order to tighten/loosen the arms is a thin flat piece of plastic that can really hurt the fingers when you're trying to get them nice-and-tight.The first one broke within two weeks. That's right; just two weeks. I was at my desk using it when the boom arm collapsed at the joint at the base. The spring just completely gave out and left me with a paper weight. While the boom arm looks cool you have no visual access to the inner workings. Because of this I couldn't even try to troubleshoot the issue with the spring/joint let alone fix it.This was returned to Amazon and I received a replacement. This one lasted roughly six months. Then one night while I was in my living room I heard a loud *THUD* in my office. The springs gave out. I'm not sure which joint it gave out on as all joints are broken. No matter how you twist the tensioners on any of the joints it doesn't do anything. I then looked at the bottom of the boom arm (underneath its base) and saw the screw/plate is completely loose. It's no longer secured inside the base.Yet again whatever the issue is I can't even attempt to fix it as the boom arm is entirely enclosed. And because this one failed after about six months I cannot return it. An absolutely waste of money. I just hope it didn't damage my Shure SM7B when this boom arm decided to fail... again.This boom arm can be summarized as such: All looks no quality control.
4,Very high quality for sure. But it doesn't fold completely over at any of the joints. The best you can do is about 60 degrees. So if it's too close to you like if you have a small desk the mic will be at your forehead at best. But if can be used to suspend a mic above your head.
5,It works great. A lot of people think there's too much tension in it and it may make it hard to use. But I found that if you loosen the tension in the base all the way and then use the knobs on the arms it works great. No matter which way I move it it stays where I need it to be. I bought two of these one for myself and one for my son cuz we both have blue yeti mics. We use the stand with the shock mount and pop filter. Totally five stars and worth the money!
2,I bought this to upgrade my $20 scissor arm microphone stand.  I was looking for something less flimsy and more professional looking.  The Compass met both of those goals.  I currently use the Blue Yeti microphone which is heavy so I figured the Blue Compass with strong springs was the correct boom arm to use.The main problem with the Compass is that the springs are too strong and there is not a way for me to get the correct tension.  There are three tension adjustments on the arms one at each joint.  Then there is another tension adjustment on the base which is a screw.  The problem was that the middle tension joint was too springy and would slowly pull the microphone up.  Even when I tightened as far as I could at the joint.  If I then adjusted the screw under the base it would loosen ALL of the joints.  So the middle joint would be perfect but then the other two would be too lose and fall down.I spent way too much time trying to get this to work correctly and ultimately gave up and returned the arm.  I am going to stick with what I have now until I am ready to upgrade my microphone.
4,I like this stand for all the little things cable management good weight load it holds my surface pro with some attachments anyway I took a star cause I do feel there are small problems like springyness.
5,This is a solid and minimalistic looking boom arm although the price is high I do find it the perfect match into my setup and it's held really well with my Blue Yeti and Radius iii Shock Mount. The initial slight adjustments you have to make to make sure the boom will go where you want it to and stay without being too tight or loose can get annoying as its easy to go too tight or too loose with the slightest turn but that's definitely not a deal breaker for me. I love the arm and would absolutely recommend it to any of my friends that are using Blue Yeti microphones.
2,This arm looks great. It has a good cable management system it looks and feels great but since getting it I've found out that there's a fairly common manufacturing issue that results in the internal springs being FAR too tight. I thought that the people complaining about this issue were missing the information about the tension screw or the friction plates but I was wrong. If you get a defective arm no force on Earth or Heaven is going to keep that arm in place.That means we're left with a choice. It's a great arm and a lot of the features are spot on but are you willing to roll the dice on getting a non-defective arm or having to return it and hope for a good one? I've requested a new arm and in the meantime I'll be attempting to find a relatively safe way to attach something heavy to the end to keep it down.
5,For years I've simply sat my Blue Yeti mic on my desk and moved it in front or out of my way as needed. This would not only take up desk real estate that I needed free but would be SUCH a hassle as I'd have to move it almost every hour of the workday.I finally decided to try a mic boom arm and chose this one after reviewing and much consideration. This has been a game changer and life saver more than I could imagine. Freedom on the desk and being able to very easily move it where needed..... I can't imagine going back to a simple desk stand for my mic again.
2,I bought this mic arm for a video podcast studio that our organization is building.  It's one of the most attractive looking mic arms that we could find. However the springs they use are ridiculously strong.  The mic arm just keeps slowly expanding into a straight arm that leans back.  You literally have to be King Kong to tighten their crappy plastic tighteners to get it to sorta stay in place.  Even then good luck if you have to adjust it. As soon as you loosen it - BACK UP - because it will quickly swing up like a catapult and smack you in the face.  Seriously how on earth do you design something like this and ship it out. Does anyone test this stuff before it hits the market?  Do they attach a 20 pound weight instead of a mic?  We've had it set up with out mic (RE20) for a few weeks now.  It has soften a little bit over that time but it's still not as functional as it should be for a studio space.  Now to be fair we tried several other arms ranging in price from $70 - $300. NONE of them perform very well. However K&M made the best functioning one ($298) but it just looked too junky on video.  This seems to be a situation where basically everything is crappyily made in China and sold in mass quantities online.  I really wish I could find an attractive mic arm that is adjustable like a pneumatic VESA mount but I can't seem to find anything like that.  All of these designs require a bunch of twist tighteners and end up being minimally functional.
3,I like how it looks great and it feels great to use. But even on the lowest tension setting the mic doesn’t stay right we’re you want it. This may sound ridicules but trust me you will know what I am talking about when you get.
3,I Bought the Mic stand a few weeks ago I waited almost 2 1/2 weeks for it to arrive as well as the estimated time was 100% wrong. Don't get me wrong it is an amazing product and its worth the money but it just took too long for the product to arrive.
5,Great gift for my buddy who streams. Wayyyy better than any of the mid or low tier ones I have used. I don't think I could warrant ever buying it for myself but I used it a bit at his place and here were my thoughtsThe cable management is incredibleIt stays exactly where you want itThe screw that holds the mic doesn't feel like it would strip (like 1 of my old ones did)
2,The product does not retain its tension and does not stay in position after 1 year of use...It appears that I either have a defect or the quality simply wore out after a year...I will not recommend it if you are looking for a quality boom arm.But what I don't understand is that isn't this boom arm claiming to be a quality well-built arm?
2,I used this stand with a Blue Yeti mic. It started out sturdy but over time I noticed the joint closest to the mic would not stay in place for more than a few minutes. at 14 months the joint broke
5,So I bought two. One for me and one for my husband. Both came quickly and was package decently. One though snapped right in half when we unpacked it. It was packed in a bent position and when we re moved the plastic it just fell apart. After I sent a few photos they replaced it pretty quickly! and now we have had them almost a year and they are still holding up. Dont us them if you have a light mic tho. We use the Shure M7B and it will sometimes slow rise on own.
3,It worked ok for about a month but when I got a new mic and was adjusting it I heard a snapping sound and the arm literally flew up and hit me in the face. Not really sure why it didn't do this last time. Kinda disappointed tbh. Replacement on the way but damn that REALLY hurt.
5,This is the third microphone boom arm I bought. After returning the first two I am super satisfied with this one. It's solid easy to set up swivels easily and is easy to move and get in and out of the way. Good product that does what it says it does.
5,This is without question the best mic boom in its price range. Assembly was idiot proof. Its appearance is smooth and clean it could be better if the mic cabling routed completely through the boom; Unfortunately the cable is exposed at the henges. My studio for podcasts has three of these each with an EV RE-20 in a shock mount. The look is pro and when you move the boom while recording the sound is pro too - it's silent. To get something better the cost would be $350 for the boom plus the mounting system you need for your situation.The only thing I didn't like about this was the manufacturer's logo which in my opinion destroys the clean look.
5,Firstly I would like to say that all reviews relating to tension on the arm should be ignored. The spring tension can be adjusted with a screw under the arm. The friction knobs are just to secure the arm in one place but will not hold the arm up or down when paired with high or low tension.The arm itself has nice construction and feels sturdy. The tension can be adjusted to support most microphones. It can comfortably support my snowball up to my yeti with shock mount and pop filter.I purchased this arm over other options because of its design. I think that is looks better than the older style of arms. The compass does not however have the ability to hold the orientation of the mic itself when the arm is adjusted. This is a minor issue for me however if it is a requirement for you the rode psa1 may be a better option.
5,I bought this stand for my SM7B and the clearence from the threads to the first elbow are so tight that the arm it's putting wear on the XLR cable due to the mounting style of the microphone.  In some instances it actually requires questionable manipulation of the plug in able to spin the mic due to way the SM7B was designed.  If you are getting this mic for the SM7B I would recommend against it. It's a high quality arm otherwise
5,This is easily one of the most appealing if not THE most appealing looking microphone stand its very solid and the whole frame is made of metal so it has a very nice quality feel.For all of the people complaining about the tension or springy nature of this stand " ADJUST THE TENSION SCREW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAND. " The stand comes with a sticker pointing the screw out as well as instructions telling you to adjust it to work with the weight of your microphone yet almost everyone seems to disregard it and complain about the stand not supporting the mic correctly.I know instructions are for " uncool " people but read your instructions folks!
1,This is one of the few products I've ever had to return to Amazon. It literally does not do the one thing it's supposed to do which is hold a microphone in the desired position.Within the first couple of minutes after taking it out of the box one of the joint covers popped off and I heard a snapping sound as if a plastic tab had broken off. I didn't actually find anything broken on the cover or the boom nor could I find anything on the floor so I'm not sure what this was. In any case it was not reassuring. The screw from the middle joint also fell out followed by the nut and I had to press hard and awkwardly from multiple angles simultaneously to get it all back into position. The build quality of this middle joint and its moving parts are really bad. The outside of the middle joint also has a sharp uneven plastic edge that looks so broken I'm still not sure if the one I received was defective or if it's just badly made in general.It mounted to my desk nicely and the base joint felt sturdy and swiveled smoothly and quietly. However the three joints and especially the middle one absolutely cannot hold the position you set them to. I tightened the joints as hard as I could and like other reviewers nearly bruised my fingers with the amount of force necessary. And yet the arm swings back into its default position at the middle joint no matter how hard I tightened.I'm not an idiot. (Well I might be but not for this particular reason.) I read the instructions carefully and adjusted the fine-tuning screw in the base of the boom. I tried positioning the mic after several different adjustments of the fine-tuning screw. Super tight super loose and everything in between—the middle joint would always spring back to its default position.I could have just dealt with it and used the boom from a different position that worked better with its design but for $100 this product should work perfectly not barely. I'm going to try the Rode PSA1 next and hope it will be better than the Blue Compass. Very very disappointing.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This holds the weight of my Blue yeti mic no problem has a tension screw at the bottom and three joint tightening points. I originally wanted it to come from a shelf above which would have made it upside down but it sits in the mount via gravity so I was unable to use it for that application. This is also the case for many others I've looked at as well but not a big deal.
1,So first as another reviewer mentioned it's easy to bend the hinge the wrong way on accident.  Its natural spring makes it bend the wrong way naturally - but it's enough to make you think you just need to pull it the rest of the way down. But then you meet resistance realize you've pulled it the wrong way and now you've bent the plastic fame enough where you probably can't return it.The other issue I had with this is that I could not tighten the hinges enough to make it support my Yeti mic. It would just slowly rise up and up and up until the entire boom with the mic was pointing straight up. Drove me nuts. There is a screw in the base of it the instructions say to loosen if you encounter this. I took the screw all the way out and it still didn't fix the issue. Essentially this was instant garbage for me.Other reviewers who had issues with this boom mention the RODE PSA 1 Boom and that's what I bought to replace this. Go buy the RODE before you buy this. It's roughly the same cost and it worked AMAZINGLY well. It was laughably easier to set up and use. There are no hinges to adjust. you just hook your mic up and it stays in place. So yeah. Save your money here - go check out the RODE.
5,I purchased one of those cheap $20.00 boom arms for my computer setup originally and actually used it for well over a year. I finally decided to purchase this one with a gift card I received for Christmas and now I'm kicking myself for using that cheap stand for so long. The difference in quality is honestly night and day between this stand and all of those cheaper options. Sure those other arms get the job done but they require constant readjustments which many times require tools for certain points on the arm. All adjustments with this boom arm are quick and easy no tools required! just give the tension adjuster a little twist and it's set for good. I can't speak for every microphone as far as the arms ability to hold it's setting but it has no issues at all with my Blue Yeti microphone which is quite heavy compared to some other mics. If you're serious about your setup do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on this stand it's worth every penny!
5,This is mic boom has worked really well for me and I have had no problems with this product. Some people have mentioned that this boom is too strong or the springs are too tight this is all true. Although I think some of those people may have exaggerated their claims because they didn't actually figure out how to loosen the springs. For you see... on the bottom part of the boom arm lies a screw that will let you loosen the spring and then let you place the boom where you actually want it. I have in my review provided a photo of the exact location of this screw once and one must simply loosen the screw to achieve the desired effect. So for any one ordering this product in the future please take note of where this screw is! it will save you a lot of hassle time and effort. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BLOODY YOUR FINGERS!
4,This thing is built like a tank! It's going to last a really long time and the cable management channel is a very nice touch.Don't expect to pull this out of the box and get it ready within 10-15 minutes. I had to completely remove the tension screw from the bottom of the unit and it still feels a bit too rigid. However my AT2020 mic is pretty light so it doesn't add as much weight as some other more premium microphones.
3,The arm has no way to keep from bouncing up. I tried tightening the middle screw on the arm and it broke the mechanism before it held the mic in place without pulling up. So I got stuck with a junk 100 arm. I should have viewed the reviews on youtube first. All of them show this being a problem.
2,The arm doesn't stay in one spot. Its constantly moving up even after you tighten it from the thumb screws and the tension tube.
1,I'd love to know what mic they were using when calibrating the internal tension device because even with a 3.5 lb mic on it the middle arm still pulls it up. Considering most common mics will be around 1.5 to 2.5 lbs this really makes the boom arm unusable for most folks. Even with the tension screw completely removed (mine came at its 'lightest' setting) there is FAR too much tension in this thing.Even blue yetis mics max out around 2ish lbs which begs the question... whose mics were they designing this for?The articulation should be smooth across all ranges of motion and stay where I PUT IT but this one just fights you to get it into whatever position it wants.Unfortunately blue missed the mark on this one and is clearly a bit of a cash grab on par with most products aimed at gaming/streaming.I don't normally offer suggestions in reviews but I know many people will be swamped by the choices. If you're looking for a decent mic arm look at a Rode PSA 1 for the same price Samson or if you're married to the design style pick up one of the many Chinese knockoffs here for half the price (they're literally carbon copies made with the same materials just different branding but the same articulation problems)
5,Funny... if people had taken the time they used to write lengthy negative reviews of this arm and instead used it to read the actual directions I think they would have actually liked the product.  There is a very clearly labeled tension screw at the bottom of the arm that can easily adjust the tension to the precise level needed.  Installation was a piece of cake and it holds my Blue Yeti with no issues whatsoever.  It's also one of the best looking boom arms I've seen.  The only thing I can say against it is the price is too high considering they sell a bundle that actually includes the Blue Yeti Blue Radius III and this boom arm for what the arm and shock mount cost alone.
4,My Boom Arm does its job well in holding up my microphone where I want it but it takes a lot of turns on the hinges to get the tension right. At first I even thought that I might break it by turning it this much. Sometimes you even have to adjust it again after a few weeks because it loosens up over time but its not that much of a hassle to me. Another thing is that the gold screw end where the microphone attaches seems to corrode easily and mine seems to be rusting up and it has only been a few months since I had this so be sure to wipe it whenever you touch that part. But after setting it up to how you want it to be it works well.
4,This is by far the best boom arm i've had period a lot of mics come with one but i upgraded to this one and now i want to buy a second as soon as possible for my podcasting setup and when it moves and flexes it is super quiet and goes into the exact spot you are aiming to put it.
3,I was really excited about this product. I'm not a fan of the visual of having exposed springs on my boom arm and the Blue boom arm should have solved this dilemma. Sadly though I am unable to use this product. I use an Elgato Wave: 3 USB microphone with the optional shock mount and pop filter. This totals at around 1.4 lbs. On the lowest tension possible this cannot hold the boom arm in place.I don't think this is a manufacturer issue because this arm is most likely intended for heavier XLR microphones. I just would have liked the description to mention the minimum weight requirement which from my estimates is roughly three pounds. That is heavy enough to hold the arm in a bent position and move around comfortably.
5,I got this boom arm for steaming to keep the mic off my desk.  It has worked great.  The arm feels very sturdy the turn knobs to adjust and lock the joints are kinda hard to use but it might just be because I don't know 100% how they're supposed to work.  I have had the arm in the same position since I got it and it hasn't moved.
4,This mic arm is nice but just know you cannot tighten the mic arm to much or it will break. There is a tension screw at the bottom of the mic arm you can loosen so you have more control over it especially if you have a lighter microphone.
5,I've had the rode arm and this one I like much better.This arm seems much more sturdy and doesn't make creaking sounds every time you move it. It is nice and smooth and looks very clean compared to the rode mostly because of the cable route built into the arm. I also notice that my mics don't loosen over time on this arm like they would on the Rode.Overall a very good arm with no complaints.
5,I did some hunting around for a good boom mic stand for my Blue/Yeti microphone to help clear off my desk and be able to support either sitting or standing recording.  While there are many options out there you kind of get what you pay for... I'm still glad I bought it but would have given it 5 stars if it was a little cheaper.  However it's sturdy clean adjustable and hides the cable perfectly!
2,The Blue Compass looks like it would be easy to use but somehow it is not. I used the Compass with a Blue Yeti Nano. When I originally set it up it was difficult to find the right tension adjustments using the base screw along with the other adjustment knobs available on the outside of the unit. After a lot of trial and error (spanning a couple of days) I found the right combination of settings and the mic arm worked pretty great after that.4 months later I'm re-arranging my office. Went to setup the Blue Compass and for some reason the adjustments were no longer holding the Blue Yeti Nano in place any longer and instead would slowly creep the microphone toward the ceiling. I attempted to go back and try and re-adjust everything once again and one of the tension knobs busted clean off rendering the Compass completely unusable. Really disappointed with the quality of this for the price that was paid.I will note that I know a few others that have the Blue Compass and do not have any issues but they all use the regular Blue Yeti which is a pretty heavy microphone. If you're using the standard Blue Yeti this arm should work well for you but if you're using a relatively light microphone you're probably going to be in adjustment hell with this microphone arm.
4,Overall i like the cleanliness of the design. Tension points could use a little work as despite being tight already the arms self adjust to its own tension.  Also once tight those tension points are hard to turn without thick gloves or pliers.
5,Right of the bat you know that this boom arm supports what it states in the specifications. I have purchased knockoffs of this type of tension spring boom arms and could barely support what mic I put on it. The arm sure is pricey added with the shipping cost to my place. But the quality is definitely there.
5,Durable great arm length no complaints
5,This is sturdy and holds the microphone well easy to adjust
3,The construction is amazing and it is very easy to setup. However for $100 I'd expect this to stay in the position I set it at.There is alot of tension in the middle of the arm making it hard to adjust. Unless you have a heavy mic or want to keep it in a 90 degree position this arm is not for you.
5,This was an "Apple" experience - it just works. No adjustment needed and it stays in place wherever I put it which was a relief given other reviews complaining about the tension. The cable channels are a nice feature and the matte black aluminum constructions looks nice. It's nice to finally reclaim the desk real estate that was used by my Yeti's stand. I use this in combination with the Blue Radius III shock mount & an Aokeo pop filter and both snapped on easily.
5,This is extremely sturdy and flexible and looks great! The one thing people need to do is read the LABEL on the boom arm when you get it. It has a screw on the base of the arm which you can use to adjust the tension. With that feature you can set it to exactly the length and angles you want each segment and it just stays there. I use one for a Yeti and one for an AT2020 and I adjusted the tension to each microphone. That means that each is adjusted for that weight microphone. You can really fine tune it to your needs.I also love the way it hides the cables inside the stand. I love good cable management.
4,Very nice and I love the cable management. I just wish there was a way to make it not turn so easily.
4,Needed to mount my blue microphone and ordered this based on YouTube reviewers. It’s a great microphone arm.However for what it does it’s way too expensive. You are paying for the name with this arm. There are other options out there that you can buy to save some money. If you are looking for brand name/logo then this is the way to go.
5,LOVE THIS ARM for my home studio. I hated it at first because it was so stiff and inflexible and then I watched a video online comparing it to a Rode and he showed the small screw under the base that you can loosen or tighten.. Presto - it loosened up perfectly. I had bought a cheap ZingYou that was a total joke. Got what I paid for. The Blue is awesome and looks super cool without all those springs or wires showing. I am a singer/songwriter/producer (1/2 of the band Jackopierce) so I love being able to pull it down to my voice/guitar without having to get up from my computer. It also extends high enough for me to stand and cut  vocals. Highly recommended. Sorry no pics I’m on a flight and just wanted to get this out before I forgot.
2,DO NOT BUY!! I was torn between buying this boom arm and the psa1 and I should have gone with the psa1. The arm itself is really nice looking and very clean however where it fails is with the tension springs. The tension out of the box is way to strong which means it won't stay in the position I want it to. I bend it to the desired position and it just shoots back up. I tried finding a balance between loosening the tension screw hidden in the base of the arm and tightening the locks in the joints of the arms for several minutes.  I was finally able to bend the arm the way I wanted it to but now if  i try to move it to any other position the tension screw is so loose that the arm won't stay up. It just droops down.  Its just not worth the trouble and especially not worth the money. Trust me when I say DONT BUY IT.
5,I read the bad and good but this was a 5 star purchase for me.  It mounted easily and I did not have a problem tightening or positioning the mic where I wanted it.  I absolutely love the cable channel for the usb and headset cord.  Paired this with the Blue radius III and Blue Yeti Black.  Couldn’t be happier at the moment.
4,Many people are using it wrong i think it works just fine. but still confusing instruction. Need to put Mic to balance out the weight to adjust tention of the arm. Screw doesn’t really looks like functioning tho.
5,Works as expected haven't run into any issues at all and was pretty easy to setup
2,Bought this for my Blue Yeti mic. The first one of these I bought would NOT stay in place even when I loosened the screw to the limit (just before it came out) and cranked down the friction screws with the force of a thousand horses. It constantly wants to lift the mic out of my face. Apparently there are manufacturing issues where they over-tighten the internal springs. After returning for a 2nd one I had the exact same issues. This sucks because it IS nicely made and sturdy but simply doesn't do its only job. I'll be returning this one as well.
5,I decided to go with this one. After watching reviews and research. And testing out the product. This was the perfect fit. No issue with adjustment. Once I was able to understand how to properly adjust the position to where I wanted it. I was excited to know that I made the right investment.
3,I’m probably gonna buy another One… But I was really disappointed in how finicky the tensioner was.  Fell apart after a month or so.
4,Clamp portion is cheap and will damage a desk. Otherwise it's a great product.
3,Very hard to adjust by hand. Had to use pliers on hand grips
5,I got the Compass boom arm from Blue to get my Blue Yeti mic off my desk. I recently switched to an M1 Mac mini with new LG displays. I needed a better microphone set up for video conference and audio records. I love this combination. The Compass is a quality accessory and it looks great up and away from my messy desk. I highly recommend it!
2,The Compass looks good and the cable management is adequate though the device doesn't completely hold your cable inside. It's definitely better than every other mic boom in that regard.As for articulation  - it worked great for the first few hours. It uses some sort of internal tension technology that causes problems though. When you install the boom into the base with the clamp you just lay it down on top and it gives you that advertised 360 degree swivel. This is important because when you're done recording you want to swing the device out of the way. I went to swing it out of the way just now and i realised that the clamp was also moving. The arm wouldn't swivel any longer.I took the thing off of the table to inspect it and i nearly hurt myself trying to separate the clamp from the boom. It won't budge and it doesn't rotate. This is a huge problem because every time i force it to rotate the clamp moves ever closer to the edge of the table.The instructions say that there is a tension screw that you can play with to solve problems over with regard to tension. The problem is that the screw is in the base of the arm and I can't get to it...because it's stuck. Yuck.The upshot is that now the thing is basically stuck in one not-so-useful position. One day in.I definitely expect more for the $100 price i paid.But mostly I expect more from Blue Audio.Save yourself some trouble and get something else.
3,So i unblocked this and put my mic on it and tightened everything out but the boom arm itself would spring itself back to a standing straight up position i will not me purchasing this again.
3,Literally had to keep adding weight to the arm to get it to balance in the right place. We have a yeti so pretty heavy mic and it pops up. Had to add the Yeti stand with zip ties to add enough weight for the mic to be placed where I need it. And it's close enough don't want to touch it in case it flies back up. So frustrated with this boom. If anyone has better suggestions I'm open. I can't return this one since it's been too long but I needed a workable set for a time project. Have to save up for a new set.
5,The blue yeti compass comes as advertised. It's an athletically pleasing mic arm that looks and feels professional on a beginner-intermediate budget. The mic arm is stiff out of the box so be sure to fine tune to your liking.Pro's:-Sturdy-Feels high quality-Cable management-Does what it is supposed to doCon's-Price this should be around $80-Feels stiff with a lighter cameraI'd say this is a buy if you need the sleek look and quality.I had a cheap mic arm once... it wasn't fun
5,Bought this as a second attempt at a desk-mounted microphone stand for my Yeti after I had to throw the cheaper one I bought away.This one feels premium looks really good and comes assembled except for slotting it easily into the desk mounted base. Position adjustments are easy and when you swing it out of the way it doesn't grind on itself like the cheaper one I bought did.
5,I will say it took me a second to figure out how to set it up and learn how to work it. But now that it’s up and working it’s by far THE BEST mic stand on the market.I’ve used others in the past (available here on Amazon). This one looks super professional and functions extremely well with my Shure SM7B mic.
4,It is a great boom arm but the only problem is if you have a light weight mic like my hyperx quadcast. You have to have the boom arm facing toward you and not your side. The cable clips are really nice too. And I have no other complaints.
5,This is something I didnt think I needed. I was one of the many people who used a generic $15 mic arm for the longest time and didn't think much of it but oh boy did this stand change things. Its so much easier to maneuver and just feels so much better. No more creaks no more wobbly arm. no more sag no more drooping arm.
5,I really like this microphone boom arm. It's sleek easy to adjust and gives options for a bolting the unit to a desk or using the sturdy clamp that comes with it. It has a long reach and a 360 degree swivel so it's easy to pull close or move out of the way when not in use. This thing is a functional piece of art!
5,I use it for my Video Podcasts. It is sturdy. It stays in place and I am very happy with it. I had one of the cheaper two tube arms and this is just head and shoulders above those. There are knockoffs of this design out there do not be confused. It is worth the price to use this.
5,Look the arm works great is clean and does not include a cable. The cons of this arm is that it only bends in certain directions and requires a pretty weighty mic to make sure it stays down. Last thing is that some of the knobs are plastic. I would buy it again but it is not for everybody.
3,The material is great quality but I had an issue with the middle knob. It will not keep the arm in place no matter how much I adjust the tension. Unfortunately I have to keep the arm straight out which isn’t a big deal but definitely a let-down.
5,I had a cheap mic arm previously and felt like I was constantly battling with the exterior springs and the grinding sound it would make when rotating the whole arm away from me when I needed better visibility of my monitor. With the interior components and sturdiness of this arm all of these issues have disappeared. It costs a bunch more than the cheap one I previously bought but would say it's worth every extra penny.
1,Product is impossible to adjust. I loosen the adjustment screw until it's 1 turn from falling out located underneith the base with the twist adjustments loose WITH a Blue Yeti X on the end of it and it still shoots up like a catapult. Save your money and buy something else. It's a 50/50 you'll recieve a working product.
5,I had a double arm cantilever type mount and it just didn't do the job. After mounting the Blue boom arm my mic is capably supported spins easily out of the way when not needed and is in no danger of falling off my desk. I am very happy with this boom. Thank you Blue!
3,I purchased this Mic-Arm to use in tandem with my Blue Yeti (as I would guess most people would chose to do so) and the overall quality seems and is great!The largest issue I have with this device is the way you have to set the balance. There is a small notch-type crank on each joint. It is too small to effectively move to the desired strength and the base mic will just shoot straight up. I have resorted to using some plier-type thing to just get a good enough angle on it to turn the notch enough but that has resulted in some physical damage.I would love to give this item 5-stars based on everything else because it is nice and slick with a very easy to use cord concealer but the struggles just setting up the angles are not worth the $100 price point.
5,Before you read the one star reviews that say this mic arm is junk you should be aware that if they had read the instructions almost all of the issues could have been avoided.On the bottom of the arm there is a spring tension adjustment screw if your arm wont hold your mic up tighten the screw and if the arm extends on it's own even with the joint locks tight then loosen the screw until it stops.With the tension screw adjusted properly the arm should hold the mic right where you want it with little to no tightening of the joint locks... if you tighten those locks as tight as you can you will break them.Hope this helps I am very happy with this mic arm.
3,As a number of other reviewers have stated (and as confirmed in a number of reputable YouTube reviews) this stand doesn't stay where you want it despite several tension screw adjustments. There's a "bounce" to the arm that is incredibly annoying. It has great aesthetics and looks fantastic on camera but has poor functionality despite the solid build quality. I returned it for the PSA1 which is perfect (well built and stays exactly where I want it with great maneuverability). I use the PSA1 for my Shure MV7 and am extremely satisfied.
1,I purchased this as a late birthday present for myself. I have a podcast and need a boom arm for my mic. I have a Blue Yeti mic so I thought this would be perfect as I love things to match. When it came in the mail I immediately pulled it out and knew there was trouble. It was completely straight and I tried to bend the arm down but couldn’t. I thought it was my weak lady arms so I called my husband in to help. He couldn’t get it either. He attempted to loosen the tension at the bottom but that did NOTHING! Every time he forced the arm down and tried to tighten the finger screws it went right back to a straight position. He even called our friend in to help and with the both of them they couldn’t do it. It may look nice but it sucks! Don’t bother buying this if you want something that’s functional.
1,This is seriously the worst product at the $100 mark I've ever used.  It's awful.  Like just completely and utterly awful.  I thought maybe I was doing something wrong so I turned to the manual and hit the youtube but nothing.  No matter where the tension screw was set it simply would not stay in place like at all.  We're talking 3 units all were - I want to say defective - but I think they're manufactured this way.  Doesn't matter if you have no mic a 1lbs mic or a 2.6lbs mic - it will not stay in place.  The plastic thumb screw knobs - no matter how tightly they're torqued down will not keep the joints from moving - wow what an absolutely horrible design.  I have one that I'm using now and I'm using tape to keep the joints from moving. Tape! The only joint where the large thumb screw actually holds in place it at the microphone - now I don't know if it's because that joint is so small - I have no idea but it does work to keep the mic where you want it - again only at that last joint.  God awful!  Stay away do not buy this move onto a different product.
5,The stand comes in 2 parts the arm and the clampSecure the clamp onto your desk and then the arm just slides into the top of the clampIf you have issues with the arm not staying put there is a small screw on the bottom of the arm that you can tighten or loosen with a philips-head screwdriver to adjust the tension of the spring inside the arm (this makes a big difference if you're having trouble and is easy to overlook).I use a Neumann TLM-103 and after loosening the spring tension in the arm and tightening the friction locks the mic stays exactly where I place it without hassle
1,The most expensive and flawed product I have ever boughten. Not worth the $100. Poorly designed as in necessary. Very bad do not buy.Update: As I was writing this the product fully broke somehow and now can't even hold the weight of itself. I want my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
2,I usually post great excellent reviews etc.  Try to be positive but this unit broke Judy trying to get it to stay in place.  Screw pulled out wouldn't stay put loosened the adjuster at the bottom etc.. just Garbage.  I put in another bolt and got it to work.
4,The included "C" clamp has too small a jaw opening for tables having a wide edge (4").  I did the work-around with a desk bushing for the arm.  Not included with the boom arm  another $24.
4,I like this but the tension is strong even if you lower the tension for a lighter mic so youre gonna have a little issue unless you place it somewhere near you on the desk.
2,This looked good and has nice features like a flat clamp so you can clip it onto a table near a wall. But the tension in the arms is so strong it keeps floating back up into a straight position. Trying to adjust it per instructions doesn't work. It apparently requires an extremely heavy mike. I use a blue yeti which apparently it is made for. But still it won't maintain position. I am returning it.
4,Very solid and the best looking of any boom stand I've had before.  It's expensive and a bit short depending on your configuration but very nice.  I usually skeptical of desk clamps but this one is very solid.
4,Very good
1,After reviews I was looking forward to having a positive experience with this product unfortunately I was mistaken. Out of the box the product looked promising felt great and appeared to be made out of quality materials however upon installing my Hyper X Quadcast S which is not a very heavy mic I was having issues with the arm not being able to support the weight of my mic the arm kept falling down and could not stay up I attempted to adjust the tension on the arm at the point that was sagging and the plastic adjustment knob came off as well as the back plastic plate exposing the now broken hardware inside. the hardware inside appeared to be held by friction said hardware was pushed out of place from my attempt at adjusting it no unreasonable amount of force was used simply poor design or assembly. In the end I just super glued the problem hinge to make it work until I decide to get a replacement from a different company. What I can say positively about this product is that set up (besides the one hinge that was bad) was extremely fool proof and the surviving hinges are great as well as the rotation of the base.
2,Overall I love the design and form of this mic stand. However I have a lighter mic and could not get the arms to stay put they kept wanting to extend out. This is after adjusting all of the tension screws available on the device. It's a shame but wanted to put this out there so anyone else with a lighter mic can beware.
4,Its good for blue yeti i recommend that
3,As other reviewers have stated the arm won't stay in place for anything other than the heaviest of mics/devices. Yes there is a tension spring at the bottom but it barely does anything. Each joint has a tensioner but even using pliers to crank down on each one is not enough to keep the arm from springing back at the joint. I've mounted a small camera on mine. Perhaps if one was mounting something much larger . . . say a car :-)The arm is beautiful but doesn't work. At least for my purposes.
4,Very nice arm. It at first confused me how the bungee system worked in it. But with the mic added on it helps you to maneuver the joints and lock them in place a lot easier. I gave it 4 stars because I feel it could be a lil less money. Build quality is great but for $99 I feel it should be about $75.  Overall with y shock mount and mic it adds a very professional look to my desk.
4,Tension in the springs in just a little to strong. But really good book arm for the money.
5,Only works about a month and all the  stand arm  fell down  is not worth foe the money
4,es más caro de lo que debería pero funciona
1,Tried setting up this arm with the Blue Yeti which it was primarily marketed as being made for. However no matter how hard I tightened the tension screw and knobs the arm wanted to fling the mic into the air every time I released it. It’s designed (idiotically) so that it relies on gravity fighting tension to hold the mic steady; if your mic + shock mount combo ends up being too light or the tension too high the arm just extends out all the way no matter what you do.
1,I can say I don't review items much at all unless I feel the need to warn consumers of a product that is absolutely terrible....that is this product.. Tension...way too much retention...not enough unless you've got yourself a ten pound mic...it will constantly take your mic to the ceiling.If you like your mic in a set position this is not your product if you want a quality product that wont break this is not your product. If you are buying this just because of the cool XLR cable slot mid you is the only good future of this product; Steer clear away from this especially if you are just getting it to match your brand mic there are way better options...
2,I ended up returning this boom arm. It was impossible to work with in fact I'm pretty sure something was wrong with it.  This thing had some much tension in it it just wasn't able to hold any position. Adjusting the screw at the bottom did pretty much nothing maybe a slight change but still wasn't able to adjust the boom arm in the desired position. And if you don't have death grip finger tips there's no way you'll be able tighten the knobs on the joints to keep the arm from extending. For $100 this should be way easier to adjust again quite possibly could just be my unit but I've seen other people complain about this. I will be looking at other units in the future.
5,I use this for my HyperX Quadcast and its perfect. My only issue is that the tension on it is very high but I feel that over time it will adjust perfectly. The price is a bit high but it was well worth it. I used to use a cheap Newer brand mic arm and the upgrade is worth it. It makes nearly no sound when moving it too.
5,I'm in love with this mic-stand it stays where ever I leave it and never droops.At first it might be a bit stiff but rest assured it'll do what you want in less than 24 hours.with all that said I still recommend purchasing this stand only if you have a microphone over 2 pounds.(It needs resistance)As you can see in this picture I use my ShureSM7B on this stand and only have one minor issueONE ISSUE:XLR Cable might bend over the last rotational circle knob depending on the position you face the microphone in.(May cause damage long-term)
5,This product is great. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. We use them in our podcast studio we have five of them now and they've never given us any problems. We went through cheaper mic arms before we bit the bullet and purchased these but all of those broke within a few months. It's been a year since we purchased our Blue Compasses and they still show no signs of wear at all. We have Blue Yeti Pro's mounted to all of them but we've also mounted other mics (like Shure and Rode) to them and the Compass worked perfectly for those as well. The arm allows for mics to hang down or be right-side-up which has been useful for different setups. I highly recommend!
2,I was really impressed with this when I first got it. It was great! About 2 months in I started having issues with the tension in the joints. I couldn't get them to stay put and had to keep tightening them every week or two. After 4 months this lead to one of the joints completely breaking. It's unfortunate and thankfully I still have my desktop mic stand or I'd be SOL. Very disappointed that I paid $100 for something that relies on easily breakable plastic for tension.
5,Man I’ve been so frustrated with my other desk-clamp mic arm — shaky loosening bolts hard to move around.This bad boy on the other hand does NOT disappoint. It’s incredibly sturdy yet flexible moves smoothly and balances the weight of the mic perfectly (Rode NT1-A)SPEND THE $100 AND THANK YOURSELF LATER :)
5,I'm not a big fan of the cheaper boom arms because their so obtrusive looking. I bought this because it's condensed down into a single design. I'm using it for an MXL 990 and it works almost perfectly. My only caveat is that the weight of the microphone might be too little as it sometimes raises slowly by itself. I've tuned it as much as I can but it's entirely manageable. I love this thing and it works fantastically. I was also worried that it's cable system would easily hide a USB cable instead of an XLR but I'm happy to report an XLR cable fits inside no problem. I love the clean look.
5,This is the best looking boom you can buy for under or around $100.Let’s address why people are leaving negative reviews:1. The internal spring is VERY strong BUT that’s GOOD because it’s designed to hold heavy microphones (this is a good thing)2. The videos you see of other peoples booms falling is because they aren’t strong enough to turn the locking mechanism fully because the spring is strong. So find someone who is strong that can properly tighten the joints3. Easily the best for the money. Better looking than the Rhode. Fits any kind of mic4. My mic is super heavy and it holds it like a champ.
4,This mic arm is very good its actually the best one I have every had. The one thing I don't like about it (but have come to work with) is the part were the mic actually is; it is sorta difficult to set up the mic in the right spot and it takes a certain technique to put it in the perfect spot. Don't get me wrong it is an amazing mic arm and I love how it finds the perfect balance with its elasticity. (its also pretty heavy compared to a typical 15$-25$ mic arm)
5,Truly professional for functionality and for views of other when they look at the way you speak! Don't forget to also purchase the Shockmount it will reduce the noise when touching the table or the boom accidentally Yeti mic is very sensitive it can even pick up the sound from your keyboard when typing.
3,Overall the build quality is absolutely superior and the cable management is nice but the tension in the arm is ridiculously strong....so much so every morning I walk into my office it's fully erect with the microphone pointing in the air and I have to bend the arm back down (which requires a lot of force) and make a futile attempt to tighten the tension adjustments.  I've tried adjusting the tension using the screw on the bottom but nothing I've been able to do to lower the tension enough to keep the arm in place.  I'm using Blue Yeti w/o the vibration dampener for reference.
2,It looks great with nice cable management but the main feature for holding a mic is not as good as Rode PSA1 I've been using since 2021. It's impossible to get the tension right. Hard to put it in the height I want.
2,Box came with a huge tear. Luckily nothing was damaged. The adapter is stuck inside my shock mount. I couldn’t screw in my microphone all the way to the position I wanted it in so I had to leave it a little loose. The only saving grace is the hidden cable channel and the appearance but that’s really it. I think if my microphone wasn’t the Blue Yeti I would’ve given it a 1-star. This is because I feel that the Blue Yeti is a good fit for the Blue Compass. I can hang it overhead (which is the only way to have the mic set up so the boom arm won’t spring back up) and it wouldn’t look bad. It just doesn’t seem to be as flexible to my needs as the Rode PSA1.
4,Overall maferial is good. But C clamp is too simple and weak
1,This is the worst mic arm I've ever used. I'm so annoyed. I have a blue microphone and I figured getting a mic arm from the same people who made the mic would be the best choice especially at $100. It is a piece of garbage. Other mics stands you can move the mic around and it stays where ever you last touch it. This has this weird "tension" technology which makes the arm constantly spring upward. Best i can get it to work is to let go of the mic lower than where I want it and hope that it springs upward to spot I want it in which is a real stupid way to work a mic. They claim that a screw on the bottom of the mechanism is supposed to be tightened or loosened to help adjust the arm but you can't get to the screw while the mic/arm is set up so it makes adjusting the screw to the weight of mic impossible you just have to guess. And even after lots of trial and error it still springs up. If you never have to touch your mic while you use it maybe this work. But if that's the case why not just get a $20 mic. This was a waste of money. Stay away.
4,Love it.
1,I'm a streamer and I purchased this boom arm thinking it would help me make better use of my space give me great mic placement during streams and maximize my mobility when streaming. What I got was an arm with a hinge that isn't really adjustable at all (if you don't believe me check the other reviews).After about a month of trying to adjust the arm and and simply rotating right back up I gave up and put my mic back on the original stand. Fast forward today I decide "No I paid too much money for this thing to just be sitting her collecting dust." so I grab a wrench and start slowly tightening it (because I assumed the reason it wouldn't stay is because I wasn't "strong" enough.) and no matter how much I tightened it it would simply rotate right back to the original position (silly me).I decide to keep trying and try to tighten it little by little only for it A. TO STILL NOT TIGHTEN AT ALL. and B. For the piece to fall apart.  If I wasn't worried for the safety of others I'd sling this overpriced paperweight right out of the window.
5,I had multiple spring style booms and this thing blows them out of the water. I have two mounted on my table along a window and they fit flush enough to easily raise and lower the blinds. I am a complete novice and these booms make me feel like a pro.
4,This is a great little boom arm and I very much like the cable channel is recessed into the arm giving it a cable-free look once fully installed. Having said that I did feel like I had to really crank the tension settings knob on several of the pivot points with lighter mics (so much so that I felt like I was going to break it from over-torquing). It's a sleek boom but the Rode PSA1 is a better buy for the money in my opinion.
3,The only reason I bought this over the Rode PSA1 was because the Rode has been out of stock for several weeks now.Now the overall quality is a night and day difference between this and those cheap Chinese boom arms. It swivels 360 degrees and overall works great.However the setup process was frustrating. This thing has an industrial strength spring and I use an AT2020 USB+ so I had to use a pair of pliers on the knobs to tighten the springs and as tight as I could get it IT STILL SPRINGS BACK WHEN I MOVE THE MIC. Why does a $100 boom arm have to have such a strong spring? I shouldn't have to use a heavier mic just to use a boom arm.. more than likely will be returning this for something else.
4,This is a really great product I really do love it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the fact that it is impossible to put a pop filter on this. Sure you can use a windscreen but I prefer my stedman. It does look big in the picture so I probably should have know this would be an issue. It would just be nice if there was a small metal extension to screw on a pop filter or some type of work around. Other than that it is perfect.
4,Plastic seems to damage easy and the arm seems to want to straight itself out regardless of how much I loosen the tension on it.  Very smooth arm the rotation feels great when moving it side to side.
4,When mounting it to my monitor stand a piece from the mount broke
1,And just like that the entire arm came out of the base fell to the floor and broke the USB connection on my Blue Yeti microphone and the sound mount on the broadcast arm.  Yes I had secured it.  Yes I followed the directions.  The problem is that the arm does not secure very well into the base and comes out VERY easily.  Never again.
1,The tension in this thing is incredibly strong and should not be underestimated. Only use with heavy mics and do not expect to use with blue mics.Do not just take my word for it look at every other 1 star review complaining about the exact same thing.
1,And before anyone says the tension was to high it was reduced slightly to hold our Blue Yeti Mic in place. The Yeti was set in place and at the height we needed for our studio podcast with minor adjustments.After we set up the boom we heard a load bang and something hit the ceiling in the lower level we have a studio set up in. it had been maybe 3 hours since set up.As you can see in the picture the tension cable fell off the microphone end of the boom. Either it was loose from manufacture or just a piece of junk. Apparently it whipped up hitting our overheard camera knocking it into our ceiling damaging the drywall.Would I recommend this? NO WAY! There has been other complaints about issues. I should have went with the cheaper boom as it seems to get better reviews. When you pay over $100. for a boom you would think it would be engineered to work.So this broke piece of junk took a trip to the landfill in the garbage the day after we got it.To bad Zero Stars is not available ........
5,I’m not gonna lie I bought this knowing there wasn’t that many good reviews but honestly I actually really really liked it and it is very good and I was suggest you buy it if it is in the price range.
5,The mic arm works really well easy to install for the most part and easy to adjust the height and get out of the way when not in use. My only issue is the USB cord well for the arm. It needs a very specific width cord head to fit into the well and there were no measurements that i saw indicating the specific size needed to fit. Other than that its a great product would definitely reccomend.
5,it took me a few minutes to figure it out but once i got it right i love it its heavy duty and the joints have alot of tension and was just standing up until i figured out the right adjustments for the tension screw  im happy i got it
5,To me the question was "is a premium boom worth the money?" The answer is "yes." I have tried cheaper booms and they won't hold where you put them or they "fight" you for position. Not the case with this boom.
5,The podmic i have is a little hefty and after adjusting the tensioner screw by the base it has been amazing. I'm coming from a cheap $20 scissor arm and I like that it's much better built and doesn't make noise moving the mic around which I do quite often.
5,A great boom arm. Very sleek looking especially compared to boom arms with two bars per segment. The knobs that adjust the tension of each joint can be a little tough to sometimes grip but not a big deal.
3,After a few months the arm is slightly crooked - it bends to the right.
4,All in all this is a fantastic mic boom arm. However I would have purchased a different boom if I had known how it fits the SM7B. I’m able to mount the mic to the boom arm but the amount of travel/swivel of the mic is limited.
3,Very difficult to adjust the joint tensions.  I'm afraid to put the torque on them it would seem necessary to get proper performance.
5,Mic used: HyperX QuadcastThe mic is on the light side so you will definitely need a pop filter or some additional weight to set it up without having to turn the tension screw out to its lightest setting.  Aesthetically the arm looks great and I use it everyday for work as well as when I play games.
5,Love it!  Very sturdy and absolutely no noise when moving it around.  THE ONLY HANGUP and let me make this clear  for me it doesn’t bother me...Where the XLR cable hooks into my Shure mic doesn’t turn completely toward me.  This doesn’t matter because it still picks up your voice as it should.  Not sure why people complain about this arm.
1,I did a lot of research on this before buying and was thinking there was a 50 / 50 chance it would work on either my sm58 or scarlet studio mics.  I took the chance on it because of the clean look but honestly it is not worth it.  With both my mics getting it into position is a pain because the spring tension is too high even when the adjustment screw for balance is completely removed.  The adjustment at each joint is to the max and the arm still moves up with either mic mounting in about half the positions.  How could they not have addressed this?  Very disappointing as this could be such a great boom arm.Pass if you have anything but the yeti.  Trust me you will be saving yourself a massive amount of frustration and regret.  My cheap 10 dollar external spring boom arm is actually easier to use and adjust into the correct position.  I have a feeling that most of the positive videos out there using anything but the blue yeti were biased by the arm being sent for free to get a good review.
5,It was initially a bit too strong for my audio technica mic but eventually got loose enough to hold the mic without moving up. No problems so far aside from the tiny issue with the strength level.
4,I love this mount so far with my Blue yeti pro.
5,If you are on the fence get one. This is great and it’s portable
5,I don't understand why so many reviewers are having trouble with this boom arm. I had no problem setting it up or adjusting it with my AT2035. You attach it to your desk and tighten the knobs enough to where it won't move on its own. The advantage of this design is that you can adjust the positioning of your microphone on the fly while still having a stable arm. It also just looks much cleaner.Overall if you're looking for a better than average boom arm and are worried about some of these reviews... don't. Classic case of PEBCAK.
1,I bought this because it looks like the cleanest and most professional boom on the market for my price point. But it turns out the middle hinge on this boom arm is way too strong. A lot of reviews here are quick to point out the tension adjustment screw on the bottom as the solution to this problem but even after spending more than an hour playing around and trying every different settings with that bottom screw the tension in the middle hinge specifically is way too strong. Even after loosening that screw to the point where it is in risk of falling out--and even after taking the screw out completely--the middle hinge acts like a catapult.For a $100 price point this boom SHOULD adjust without any issues. This is the kind of problem I'd expect from a $15 boom arm. I recommend skipping this boom arm. I just started the return process for this and ordered the RODE PSA 1 instead--hopefully that one is actually adjustable and doesn't think it's hurling boulders at the enemy's castle gates.
5,This is by far the best constructed broadcast mic arm on the market today. Solid construction. Feels sturdy. Doesn't have wiggly parts (like the Gator Frameworks arm does). This is what a $100 broadcast mic arm SHOULD feel like.
3,This is a good/ok mic boom. Only problem is that it doesn’t stay in place. It moves a lot. I have it tightened all the way and it still moves. If I could have looked around a bit more I would have bought a different one. Still an ok choice.
5,The parts just click together like an easy puzzle. You then attach your mic to the boom arm and you are good to go.
2,Great build quality and holds the Blue Yeti microphone on Blue’s shock mount quite well. Love the overall quality of the product but one of the clips for the hidden cable management broke immediately upon being opened for the first time. Would give five star review otherwise! Great product!
5,Strong and supportive this honestly can hold any microphone setup its a bit hard to get it how you want but its well worth it. However I do have a 3ft wide desk and I wish this was a bit longer
5,This is the best boom arm I've ever had.  Every previous one were those dual external spring ones and they always made the most horrendous noise when repositioning.  This one is silent.  Holds my mic where I put it except it doesn't like being out straight or fully collapsed it really wants to be between about 30 degrees to 100 degrees bend to work 100% (you can crank the joints down to hold it at any point you like).  So it does have a "sweet spot" which will determine the best place to mount it.
5,With the Yeti X being a bit heavy I wanted a boom arm that would not move much.  The material quality is excellent and you can tuck in your unsightly mic wiring as advertised.  It can be loosened to some extent but if you need a boom arm that moves "very freely" then get the RODE PSA.
4,I initially had issues with the mic arm literally breaking 20 mins before my stream. Kept going up and up and up. They however are doing an RMA past the October "Support" period which I'm thankful for. Thanks!
5,This was a much needed addition to my home studio.  For those reviewers who said it was impossible to attach an additional pop filter I have shown a few pictures of my configuration.  In addition to the Blue Spark pop filter (which does virtually nothing) I use a second pop filter for an additional layer.  I was able to secure it around the mount and it is really steady.  This thing moves so smoothly and quietly and really completes the set-up.  I will be getting a second one for my other microphone at some point.
5,Very well made. Found the tension of the arm too high but after some adjustment it isn’t so bad. Manages cables very nicely. Little pricey for what it is but it did well to finish off my stream set up! Happy overall!
5,Looks and feels like this thing can take a BEATING before breaking.  If youre looking for a reliable and good looking mic arm that avoids all these other horrid reviews on other mic arms get this one.
5,Best boom arm I’ve ever owned. Hands down. If you want something that lasts at a good price buy this! The tension is adjustable and will work with ANY microphone regardless of weight. Just fine adjust al other joints and the tensioner at the bottom for your desired manuverabiliy and you’re set!Another Great thing is that there is a built in cable management channel along the top to keep your cables clean and neat.Great quality mix of Steel and high quality and sturdy ABS plastic.Will buy more when I put my podcast studio together.
1,Get a different boom mic stand. This one is a waste of money. Returned it immediately.The way this is built means you have to count on the weight of the microphone in order to hang the mic where you'd like it.That means for a heavy mic you adjust the "tension" screws at the bend points so it weighs down the arm - right. You actually aren't adjusting the arm you're TRYING to adjust the spring which is very very very tight.If you need to adjust the tension of that spring there's a Phillips Head screw in the base you can tighten or loosen.Only that screw has zero affect on the tension.  I removed it completely in fact to see how loose the tension would be and my Yeti Blue mic was hanging in the air about a foot higher than where my face would comfortably be while sitting. The arm is built to WANT to be straight. It's counterintuitive and a waste of your money.
5,I bought a Blue Yeti mic a few months ago and found it to be extremely powerful. If you use a Blue Yeti to record gameplay you're in for a big surprise. It will pick up every sound including banging on the keyboard and moving the mouse.It's basically impossible to use it on your desk if you want quality recordings.This boom arm is perfect and it's highly advisable to pair it with a shock mount (made by the same company) to achieve optimal results. I play a lot of shooters and the banging sounds went away after I purchased these items.
1,So this was delivered Jan 11 and it broke Jan 23. The middle hinge can no longer be tightened. Not to mention it was a nightmare to try and tighten in the first place. Twisting with my fingers just didn’t work. You get to a point where it just won’t go any further but the hinge is nowhere near tightened and won’t stay in the position you want it. I had to use pliers to tighten it further because doing so with my hands was just too painful and quite frankly not possible. And even after using the pliers it still wouldn’t stay in the exact position I placed it but whatever. It was usable I guess. Up until the point that something in the hinge just gave out and now it’s not at all possible to tighten.I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Broken out of the box due to the only thing holding the bolt in place is a .5mm thick plastic ring. Garbage construction. Returning the mount and all of my Blue products. Do not support a company who can't even make a quality stand for their products.
5,This boom arm is super clean and well built. My ATR2100 is definitely too light for it out of the box but after much adjustment on the tension screw I'm at a good spot. It would be nice here to know how much adjustment is available I was slightly worried if there was a turn too far that would break it. It's nice to know that one day if I ever move to a heavier setup this arm will be completely ready.I'm also hanging my headphones (HE400i) off of it when they aren't in use and it's still perfectly fine.
5,There are many swivel arms out there.  Most of them are JUNK.  Not so with this one.  It's expensive but it's good!Truly TOP OF THE LINE!!!!!
1,As in other reviews tension was designed to hold an anvil as its baseline. Unless you plan to use this mic arm over a long distance don't buy. There are better options where you won't feel like you have to compromise ideal mic placement. As soon as my Elgato LP Wave arm arrives I will start the return process for this one.By all means its a clean looking product it is just way too high on the tension. No matter how loose I made it to counter my Blue Ember it still wouldn't go past a 150 degree angle.
1,Spring tension cannot be reduced with the adjustment screw. The spring mechanism seems jammed as delivered from the manufacturer. Hung a 20lb bag of weights on it to get the arm to operate properly with a microphone. Need to return this - I’ve researched and seems I’m not alone and there is a bad batch out there.
5,I bought this to hold my Yeti Blue microphone for podcasts. It looks nice. The dials to tighten down the springs are incredibly hard to get tight enough to hold the boom and mic in place. I bought this and paid top dollar b/c i wanted top quality and something I wouldn't have to replace.Follow up: This was my fault. I set it up backwards. Here's a tip: the right way to set it up is so that the logo is right side up not upside down. Ugh. Works great now.
5,Easy to install and works well with my shock mount and yeti mic. If you can afford it get it.
1,The quality of it feels awesome! very heavy duty. Until you try to actually adjust the tension then  it's a hot mess. The tension doesn't hold at all I tried everything and it won't hold a position at all. I'd consider buying this again but I am beyond displeased I spend this much and am stuck with a boom that no longeris adjustable and stuck in a fully extended boom position. DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A BLUE MICROPHONE!!! YOUR MIC WILL NOT BE HEAVY ENOUGH!
4,It’s good but it’s pretty hard to bend in place
5,I bought this even after reading some reviews that weren't so great. The quality is good. It moves around well. There are adjustments at the joints and in the base so that it's not too stiff or loose. I'm happy.
5,So far after owning this boom arm for roughly a month. It sure work as advertised. Put it up with my yetti mic and it hold great.
5,Great add on to any setup and quite and smooth when moving it and quality is a big thing and it’s amazing and looks the best out of most boom arms I would buy it again in a heart beat.
5,The tension is high on the arm but this is a great way to mount a microphone from above. The cable management works incredibly well. The base rotates super smooth and solidly clamps.
5,I love blue yeti products they are so well built. The Blue Compass Premium Broadcast Boom Arm is the item to have if one is using a blue yeti microphone. It is well built and strong.
5,Very sturdy used for my sm mic.  Base unscrew once I made it tighter since then no issues
5,Great item for making optimal use of your Yeti mic for podcasts and other audio recordings. Very easy to move the mic just out of view of your laptop camera while maintaining perfect audio quality. Love this!
2,I would like the product if it worked the springs in the elbow are too strong and I cannot physically tighten it so it will stay in place so it slowly straightens itself from the "elbow" joint.The cable management portion was good it was able to support the Blue yeti just fine and the design of it so you don't see the springs was also good not sure if I got a faulty one because other people left really good reviews. Unfortunately they are now out of stock so I cannot get a replacement to find out so I will be returning it for now.
5,I purchased this Blue Compass Broadcast Boom Arm to hold my Blue Yeti professional microphone. I do voiceover work and I also produce podcasts for the company that I work for. This microphone is extremely heavy for its size and this boom arm has no trouble holding the weight. It's easily adjustable and once you get it in the correct position and lock everything down it does a fantastic job. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a trustworthy and functional boom arm.
5,Uno de los mejores stands para micrófono que he probado  se ve fino fuerte  durable y versátil  la verdad no lo cambiaría
4,It does what its designed to. Though  I can't seem to loosen the spring adjustment screw enough to not lift my rode procaster and psm1 shockmount up
2,My desk doesn’t have enough of an overhang to let me mount this.It’s also designed to support heavy microphones so when you try to mount something super light on it (like a Røde VideoMic NTG) the arm has way too much tension in it and you can’t get it to position the mic where you want.
2,I really wanted to like this boom arm. I love the aesthetic and everything about it feels great. Problem is unless you have a cinder block on the end of it you will NOT be able to keep it from springing open. The way the tension knobs are designed it was stripped and useless within a couple weeks. Why would they make them out of plastic so you a. can't tighten them enough to hold it in place and b. just crack after a while? If you have a SERIOUSLY heavy mic then go for it if not you'll have to add a bag of sand to the end of this thing just to keep it in place.
5,Yes the spring is very stiff. You can use the adjustment screw to change how tight the spring is if needed. I use a Yeti and it holds it perfectly.  Super happy!
5,Works good tried a few before I settled on this one. Tension screw is everthing. I wish it came with an option for middle of the desk mounting.
5,Sleek easy to use and I’ve had no problems. If you read the little booklet that comes with it it tells you there is a tension screw at the base of the arm that you can adjust to tighten the tension or loosen the tension of the spring. Heavier mics might need a good twist to the right of that tension screw while lighter mics will need a little twist to the left. This will stop the arm from falling or springing back up after you’ve already tightened the hinges.
5,Yes this is an expensive item but it is well worth it.Most boom arms (under $30-40) are cheaply made and have a hollow piece of metal that bends under the weight of most mics. This boom arm and a nice solid piece of steel and a sturdy desk mount that sits flush together with the boom arm. It also had a cable management slot down the middle which most boom arms even some expensive ones lack.
5,Works really well for my Blue Spark microphone.Although I tried it with the Blue Yeti Nano before and the microphone did not have enough weight to effectively use this stand
2,I purchased this product roughly 8 months prior to writing this review.  For the first seven months I had no issues and the product held my microphone up as it should.  I however have a the opposite issue with the arm as opposed to most.  My microphone will not stay at position it will FALL.  I have tightened the screw I have loosened it I have done everything in my power to resolve the issue I can find online and it just isn't working anymore.  I have to literally get rid of it and buy a new one.  Would Not recommend a purchase if you have a heavy or light mic.  You need something precise.  Two stars because it worked for a few months.
1,While out of the box this boom arm worked and felt like a DREAM after only 3-4 weeks of use the bottom tension spring has completely lost its ability to hold my Rode NT1. You can see other videos with the same problem in these reviews so I won't record one myself but it now simply falls to my desk and refuses to stay upright. Terrible quality in the adjustable tension.
5,Great arm for my Blue Yeti. No adjustments were needed. It held it perfectly right out of the box. Looks and works great.
5,Not sure what the people writing bad reviews are doing with this but it works great with my Rode NT1 installed right out of the box.  I did not have to adjust tension at all.
1,After reading reviews and comparing boom arm's I decided to take the leap and trust that the issues with the Compass were based around people not reading the manual or adjusting the tension screw. This was a MISTAKE.Regardless of how much I fiddled with the tension screw in any direction even accidentally removing it at one point it did not resolve the fact that the spring on this thing is just way too strong. Even tightening the nobs until my fingers ached the arm still straights out at the slightest touch with the blue yeti mounted on it. Worse yet the screws are made of plastic threads and all. After a few attempts to tighten it as much as needed to hold the arm in place the entire screw cap stripped and doesn't function at all.The earlier reviews are right at best this is a case of a dice roll hoping you get a product that's not flat out defective. At worst this thing needs 20 pounds or more on the end of it to keep it from going vertical at which point the screws will strip anyway. I purchased 50 days ago and have spent the entire time using other mic's while i came back to this when I had the time to try to get it functioning only to have it break before my first real use.
5,My first concern when I bought the thing was that I did not know if the mount would fit between my wall and desk since its a tight fit. The mount as well as the rest of the device fit perfectly and I have not had any issues. It also holds its position very well and is easy to move around. The clips and small cable channel on the arm itself make cable management easy as well.
4,A bit hard to adjust the knobs to make it stay in place. Specialist with a lighter mic.  Also the adjustment knobs are plastic and gives it a cheap feel.  The rest is fine and it will work for you
3,Like many others I have issues with the arm staying at the angle I want it to. It slowly starts slipping backwards. I promise I have tightened this like none other. My mic is also quite heavy and should be enough to hold it down as some other reviews mention.My first item snapped the wrong way but thankfully the return process was very quick! The material is amazing I just wish adjusting it was easier.
5,i think i paid about $15 for my 1st boom arm. the the connection between the clamp and the arm base was SOOO weak that it bent. this boom arm was SOOO expensive BUT SOOO very worth it!
3,Boom arm looks really good and sleek however when trying to adjust it in different positions the locks aren't strong enough for the springs so it slowly rises up trying to make the arm be straight. For the money I spent on this one boom arm IU could have bought 3 of the cheaper ones that have the same quality and lock into place and don't move.
5,Very very elegant quality. Swift to send. Quality of the wrapping was choice. A+
5,Outstanding boom and perfect for Blue Yeti. I had another brand not very compatible with Yeti. There is no comparison. Do not buy any other table boom for your microphone investment.
1,I bought this boom arm and my MV7 Mic is not heavy enough to hold it into place. But for $100 the arm should stay in place regardless of how heavy the mic is. I ordered a replacement AND STILL the issues are there. DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU ARE PUTTING A 5 TON BRICK ON IT
5,Takes some time to balance but overall great mic arm.
5,One the best book arms on the market. Bar none. Strong easy setup adapts to fit any mic quiet and the most important; the base is perfect for desk connections.
5,Easy to mount and use. The joints are difficult to tighten that is my only complaint.
4,Works as advertised I bought this for a blue snowball mic and it works great now. May be worth interesting in some plyers or vice grips before buying though if you don't have a strong grip. It was hard to get the tension set tight enough for the snowball to not just start moving upward.
5,I am very like it this is hard to put it on the table or everything else but after you succeed so you can use it very well
5,Was a decently big streamer for quite a few years and always struggled with flimsy microphone stands and my Blue Yeti (thing is heavy). Finally got this and it handles it like a champ. No more drooping boom arm or having to re-tighten screws to keep things in place. If you have the money and want something that'll last you forever get this.
5,I like Useful functional and well-designed sturdy material made arm. Also this Blue Arm saves desk space freeing up the most useful space.  Recommend highly.
2,Owned for over 2.5 years. Within the last 6 months I noticed that the knobs to tighten the arms were getting loose and no amount of tightening would hold my Blue Yeti microphone in place. Finally the lower tightening knob broke and I then had to throw the entire boom away.Materials very nice but shouldn't fail in only 2.5 years.
5,I know this is a pricey stant but believe me it is worth every penny. One of if not the best stands Ive seen and used
5,Very solid clamp to my desk.  I thought it might be a bit wobbly but it doesn't move at all.  Stays in whatever position I need.
1,No matter what you do you will struggle with the tension and it will never go low enough at any NORMAL position. It will bounce back up to a higher level. I honestly wanted it to work with my Blue Yeti mic but after 2-3 hours of struggling with every position it was just NOT usable.Looked great but the plastic quality is bad i felt it was going to snap on my any second. They could have made the body out of metal. I ended up with a product with the best reviews on youtube RODE. Best boom arm ever.
1,Be advised that the negative reviews are valid. I switched from a Blue Yeti microphone to a Shure MV7 (large weight difference). The non-behemoth Shure made me realize that the tension on this boom arm is INSANE and fiddling with the tension adjustment screw in the base of the arm does little to relieve this. The arm broke for me during tensioning the middle bend of the arm to counteract the tension spring to keep the lighter microphone in place - the plastic knob has interior grooves to grip an internal metal piece. If tensioned too tightly (which of course you do not know until it happens) the plastic grooves connecting the knob to the internals will shear off and break the elbow joint. This could be a good purchase for a very heavy microphone like a Yeti but be advised that once looking at the internals I'm amazed this thing didn't break sooner. Used the boom arm for ~3 months.
5,Stays put no twangy spring noises if it gets bumped. A quality boom.
3,Great clean boom arm. But the arm loses resistance after a while if configured horizontally to have mic close to your mouth. Would prefer longer lasting resistance so I could keep the configuration.
5,Looks good well balanced for the weight of a yeti microphone but the screws to tighten it are a little stiff.
5,I'm a professional music producer and Ableton Certified Trainer. I bought this after reviewing several mic boom stands I'm a big fan of it. Would recommend for sure.
5,Solid product. Nice smooth swivel. Easy to adjust the angles on the arm. Built in cable management and it easily attaches to my desk.
1,I ordered this in spite of the bad reviews it received largely because it was made by Yeti and was an attractive and seemingly functional solution to my microphone boom needs.  Alas the beauty would get 5 stars.  Engineering no stars.  As many other reviews indicate the tension on the bars is unrelenting.  It simply does not wish to bend in the 90 degree fashion recommended; even with a microphone attached to the boom.  The tension adjuster on the outside of the arms are ineffective in keeping the boom in any acceptable position; the tension adjuster inside the arm that attaches to a desk is utterly useless.Fortunately Amazon accepted the return immediately and with a full refund.  Yeti and Amazon should take this item off the market and fix the engineering of the tension.  This is not rocket science; it is a case of poor manufacturing design and extraordinary disregard for consumer satisfaction.  Once they do that the Yeti boom will be worth the price.  Perhaps their new owners Logitech will accomplish this task.cle
2,1: First of all the Tube-Style Broadcast Boom Arm is really not worth the price.2:It can't be put where you want it to be.It's not even as good as a ten-dollar cantilever.3:The material is mediocre not up to a $99.99 lookIs that one of the reasons why I returned it.4: "Sturdiness" I give it two stars for its SturdinessBecause its base position is stuck on the table is still solid.5:I don't recommend this productConsider the price and experience.And the quality of it.6:I thought it would be better to buy a more expensive one but it wasn't.
4,I was not as impressed as I thought I would be with this model.  It doesn't seem to tighten to a point that bumping it won't move it from it's position.  The swivel action as the base is nice to move the arm out of the way when not streaming.
5,If you want the best mic stand it's this or the other well known brand.  I think this one has superior cable management and looks better.
5,Clean look no wires
1,I really can’t imagine how they could sell a product like this. I read the negative and positive reviews found out about the tension screw at the bottom and figured the negative reviewers just missed it.Let me tell you - the tension screw does NOTHING. I loosened it entirely and the arm was still far too stiff to comfortably use. Even when I FINALLY tightened everything into position it slowly raised up (even with a heavy mic). I had to use pliers to tighten the elbow and ended up damaging the arm so I can’t even return it.This is an AWFUL product and I can’t believe it exists. What a disaster. Save your money.
3,Very disappointed that this “premium” product does not come with desk mounting bushing as shown in the instruction manual instead it only has the c clamp mounting option. The instructions say the bushing is sold separately but you cannot purchase it on the website. This bushing should be included with the arm unfortunately it is not. If you are looking for clean mounting this is not an item you should purchase. My desk is thicker than the c clamp allows.
1,So far I’m extremely disappointed. I’ve had a cheap o boom arm for about 6 months now and decided to “upgrade”. After messing with this thing for over an hour I still can’t get the tension right. If I move it the wrong way it gets all outta wack. Sucks cause I was so excited. I’ll update review if I can figure it out.-update: I gave up and am currently returning the arm. After weeks of messing with it I could never get it to work properly. Bought the elgato boom arm like I should of in the first place
5,If you want to drill a hole in your desk and use the bushing you have to buy the bushing separately.  Great product.
4,Received the unit and the moment I was setting it up the wheel snapped off and now it cannot be adjusted 1 day after the purchaseEdit: Amazon replaced the defective part within 2 days and everything works fine now :).
5,When I first unpackaged this I could instantly tell that it was built great.  Good weight and you can tell that the construction was well done and will likely last a lifetime.
1,This isn't the first nor the last complaint you'll read about the tension involved with the Blue Compass — and to be clear I made all the necessary adjustments with the screw underneath the boom arm as well as all the other tension plates and it made no difference whatsoever. This is seriously the worst boom arm I've ever used. There are $20 models that work better than this. Logitech really needs to make some dramatic changes with this product because it's not worth $5 much less the $90 being charged. Do not recommend whatsoever.
1,Tried to make this thing work for days and I CANNOT find a way to make this thing bend in the middle properly.  This is with the tension screw practically removed from the base(extended all the way aka as loose as possible)
1,You want to adjust it while on a call/streaming? Forget about it. You need to wrestle it with both hands.This is the lowest level it will stay at. Adjustments are pretty straight forward but Middle joint is impossible to adjust. Other joint are fine/smooth. Some reviewer said you can use the middle joint as car suspension and I completely agree with them. This arm is only good if you want to use it at the exact angle you see in the marketing pictures on the product page. My old $17 arm is one hundred percent adjustable however/wherever you want. You can adjust while using it. Only reason I wanted to upgrade was visuals. I will definitely return this because it's not practical at all.I am using a dynamic (unidirectional) microphone which has to stay right in front of your mouth. If you have the same requirement this arm is not for you. Amazing looks but terrible functionality.
5,Very nice boom arm for the blue Yeti mic only! It is very sturdy and I will purchasing a second one!
1,It's clear that Blue has different support than Logitech even though Logitech now owns Blue. Logitech has passable technical support and warranty service. However Blue is some of the absolute worst I've ever dealt with. Dealing with both Blue and Razer back to back was an experience I wish I never had.
4,Absolutely incredible that is if you have a desk thin enough for that champ. I was able to manage on the corner of my desk. That being said it isolates pretty much most if not all vibrations from my desk which is what I was looking for.
4,Great stand.. Easy and fast install but wish it was a little taller... May make a extention for it since I only need about 2 more inches in height...
5,It does what its suppose to do and has a very premium feel to it unlike some of the inexpensive ones listed on amazon. It does have a lot of resistance which makes sense for what it suppose to do and the only negative is there isn't any color options I personally like the black but an option for blue or white would be nice or even colors to match the various blue yeti colors.
2,Overall I love the look of it cleans up the desk but a year in it stopped being able to consistently hold up my Bluebird. Just today it seemed to give up entirely slamming my microphone into my desk.I figured a mic stand by Blue would be more reliable to hold up their own microphones. No amount of rotation of the spring tensioners helps anymore.Honestly pretty disappointed.
5,Very high quality and study boom arm. The value for your money is great. If you are in the market this is a great place to start.
1,this stand  sucks!! the  tension is  too  strong so the  stand  will not  bend and  stay in place  without  springing  straight out! may  People on  Youtube see to  have the  same  problem.  I also  hear on  Youtube that  if  you  get  a  blue compass that  wont bend  the  company  says it is a  defective  product and  to  return it. I  am  going to  try to  return mine.
5,Had to add some weight to keep it in place otherwise with the friction fittings tightened it still wants to rise up.
5,Love it!  I have been using one with an Audio Technica AT2035 since May.  Had issues with support but once I adjusted the tension scew (in the base not the plastic tensioners on the arm) everything worked great.  Once balanced you barely have to tighten the joint friction locks.  I would 100% recommend this thing.
1,The tense arms do not hold position even at extremely taught screws  bolt is too large for blue mics  would not recommend.  Also ups returns will charge for a box and label to return this even w free returns.  Be warned.
5,I bought this after having a cheap neewer one for some time. The look and quality is just outstanding.
5,I love this rig. Paired with a Rose PodMic it exceeds all expectations!
5,This is the perfect set up for work from home virtual. I have a Blue mic set up with it..
4,Nice product but it is fragile when you need to adjust the angle of the mike.
1,I bought this boom arm thinking it was going to hold up to heavy use. I couldn't have been more wrong. Heed all the other reviews. The hinge tighteners are extremely difficult to turn. Your fingers will hurt and you may think you should use an aid just to get them tightened enough to use. I kept tightening to lock the hinges into place but literally couldn't. The spring within the hinge was too strong and would always go back to the natural location. After many times of trying to tighten the hinge eventually just broke. The pictures of the aftermath are included. The design of this arm is poorly thought out and even more poorly implemented. Although the look of it is robust professional and heavy-duty the internal construction is plastic and poorly implemented. It. Will. Break.This is not worth the money at all.
5,Easy to set up very adjustable and versatile. The arm is super strong and the strength can easily be adjusted and its very movable. The cable management along the back is also a nice touch. Would highly recommend if you can get it.
1,The quality of this item is an absolute joke. I am not sure how they can come to the conclusion of 100.00 USD for this when boom arms for half the price imports are more solidly built and have a better quality metal plate for mounting to the sides of tables.When I went to install this I read the directions front to back and proceeded only to have the metal disc come flying off when mounting to a steel desk the connector piece holding it on is now broken and I had to just use the screw and secure styrofoam around it for now. The BLUE branded plastic discs adorning the arms also come flying off when you move it.The biggest offense by far is the fact that the adjustment dials to hold the arm in place only do so much to very little depending on your setup. You can be sitting there and suddenly the arm starts to raise back up into factory positioning out of box by itself yet ever so slowly. It's completely obnoxious and I cannot believe this product comes from BLUE. Its all in the name! Microphones are OKAY but these kind of accessories no don't do it at least not from BLUE.
4,Having had a few other mounts like this before in the $20 range just save up a little bit and buy this. It will work better and you will be happier just dont mess around with the other crap that wont work
5,Exceptional product with high quality components and great looks. For the handful of reviews saying it droops or won’t support this or that - yeah well try actually reading the clear instructions and increase/decrease the admittedly not-obvious tension screw in the base. Takes maybe two mins to get it right. Mine supports a Shure SM7B perfectly (after adjustment). TLDR High quality easy movement great looks.
5,As an audio producer I spend more of my life than I'd care to admit in my studio.  I have been wanting to replace my crappy spring arm boom with something like this for some time but the price point was beyond my means... until now.Installation and adjustment to accommodate my mic were simple and painless.  It looks good it's very sturdy... perfect addition to my studio.Shipping was much faster than expected too!
1,My first impression this item was that if felt and looked sturdy but as far as functionality goes it completely misses the mark. The adjustments on the item are terrible- the middle joint broke after attempting to keep it in a fixed position since the tension was such that it kept popping back up in a completely vertical position which helped no one ever record anything. I completely removed the tension screw at the bottom hoping that this would keep it from popping back up but also did nothing.Never used it. Couldn't use it. Defective and I sent it back the same day I got it.
5,Great arm looks good and is built sturdy.  Love the cable channel.
3,The tension screw and the joint tensioners dont even hold the mic up when they are tightened all the way. its a nice arm but doesnt support my SM7B. Maybe i got a bad one?
5,Using it for the last 1 year plus and it has outperformed my expectation! Very very well made boom arm
5,Installed the arm for a Blue Yeti Pro microphone the installation took minutes and all of the fittings locked right in.
4,I use this stand to make the worthless SoundCloud rap music that nobody wants to hear. The stand perfect for what I’m trying to do. If you’re looking to do the same Id highly recommend most of Blue’s products.
5,Great boom arm very sturdy. My golden age D2 microphone is 3.16 oz although the max lbs the arm states can hold 2.5 lbs max is false. I read some people saying it won't hold a blue yeti? Right! Even with the arm extended horizontal it doesn't move at all. My guess is they haven't tighten the tension screw located at the boom arms base. Great product!!
2,Wanted to like this but awkward to use and takes up a lot of space. Hard to get it to stay in a fixed position. Also the rotation friction screw doesn’t seem to work. It would be nice if it folded i. Half like many other arms. The design is very appealing looking I’ve found it to be not so usable. If I was living in the states I would have returned it.
5,Setting up the tension was the hardest part and it wasn’t that hard. Everything else was simple and easy.
1,Do not buy this if you move your mic around a lot. It will eventually get too tight where the mic mount screws in and the plastic between the middle split will lift and can poke you. I would go for a more traditional desk arm unless I was in a radio studio or something like that. It's really big which is a good thing for some people but for the average WFH'er it gets in the way.I've had 3 compasses in the past 4 months. 2 from Amazon and 1 from Blue themselves. All 3 of them have had defects with the material and have become almost un-adjustable. When explaining my problem to Blue they said I'm over-tightening it when I've barely tightened it past the golden knob.It's just not a great pick and considering I've been through 3 with the same issues on each I would advise against you getting one.
5,Works great with a Yeti Blue microphone.  Keeps the mike off the desk and positions well over the computer screen.
1,I have tension issues with mine which is apparently really common. No matter what the middle hinge will try to straighten out. The adjustment screw on the bottom does not fix this. I could return to Blue but honestly I don't feel like it. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,I had to give the Sturdiness a 5 star because well it is. The springs on this boom arm are so strong that they don't hold the mic in place. Yes I have read about the tension screw on the button. I have loosened the screw to the point where the screw was about to come out and the springs are still so strong to the point where they don't hold the position I want it to. They make it unbearable to tighten the hinges where my fingers hurt and they could bleed any second.I decided to ignore all these faults and continue to use the arm but taping it. It has now got to the point where now the caps on the hinges fell off and if you pay attention real closely. The part that tightens the hinges are actually made out of PLASTIC! They call this a premium boom arm but use cheap plastic parts. Their microphones are probably one of the best things they make but their Compass Boom Arm is utter trash. I hope they redesign this. I just wish I could get my money back or at least get a replacement for this mic arm.
4,I love this boom arm but the tension on it is REALLY weird. There has to be a microphone on it to weagh it down or else it will just shoot up and hit your wall 🤣
3,Can't maintain a fixed position... not even adjusting the bottom screw.
1,I should have read the reviews. I love my Blue Mic but this product was impossible to use. Both original and replacement wouldn't stay bent even with . Tried everything and nothing helped.Returned original. Returned replacement. Thoroughly disappointed.Seems to be a luck of the draw so good luck to anyone who buys this.
5,I have a blue yeti microphone and I am not experiencing any issues with it dropping down. The device naturally tries to straighten itself up and the clamps are supposed to prevent it from straightening. If that's not how yours works I suggest returning it for one that does work that way. So far mine works perfectly and has a nice clean look to it.
1,Even after tightening the inner screw AND turning the locking mechanism all the way the top bar still refuses to stay in place. As you can see I had to use tape just to add some friction but not even that worked well. Do yourself a favor and either buy a cheapo mic arm that lock in well enough OR buy a rode psa mic arm. There is a reason those are constantly sold out.
2,as u can see in the picture it arrived broken  and the reason for that is because whoever is behind the idea of putting it wide open in the box is dumm  and what makes it worst it the angle of the product in the box makes it easy to brake in the joint
5,So far it’s a great purchase and and it has a great build.. Love it!!
1,I have the Blue Yeti X with the shock mount. Once mounted to this boom I could never get the arm to stay put. It would always spring back within a minute or so. Tightened the screw on bottom and the turn dials on the joints without luck. I finally tightened the elbow joint enough to the point it broke.A mic boom should stay put whatever position you want within its limits. This does no such thing.
5,Really solid easy to adjust and most importantly it's quiet. Anyone leaving 1 star reviews cause it doesn't move how they want clearly didn't read the manual.
2,So this stand is not good. It doesn’t actually bend in and stay in the way you want it to and it’s fairly expensive. Looks wise it’s great but my god is it terrible for keeping a position. I’ve spoken to customer support and they offered me a full refund. The CS rep said this a common problem and they’re no way to fix it. Save your money.
1,I bought two of these one for my snowball and the other for my yeti mic. Love everything else blue microphone. But WOW ARE THESE ARMS BROKEN. They just simply do NOT work. No matter how much you tighten the joints they just DO NOT WORK. I have tried to set up my snowball so parallel to my desk and it can't even handle a 35% angle. The weight of the mic is the only thing that these joints depend on for support. Looks clean but BOTH ARE BROKEN AND ARE USELESS FOR MIC ARMS.
5,One of the best made mic arms from the folks that make the Yeti mic.
1,As you will find in other reviews- when these were made a significant number came with an overloaded internal spring from the manufacturer. This prohibits you from being able to position the mic in a number of positions no matter how much you tighten the adjustment knobs. I have heard of some purchasers getting a working replacement directly from Blue. However your money is better spent on the Rhode PSA1 or PSA1+. Both are significantly better than this arm at a similar price point.
1,I have a Rode Procaster one of the heavier mics around. And this stand is too strong for that. I can't get the mic stand to stay bent under 90 degrees it keeps popping back up. And this is with me loosening all the tension points even the one at the base. But honestly the screw at the bottom is really only for fine tuning it barely changed the result. If your mic is too light there's not much you can do. I've seen some say to add a shock mount for extra weight..well I've added that already and there's not much difference. I would seriously have to consider adding a few more pounds to get the boom arm to stay bent. So if you have a light mic I can't recommend this product but maybe you'll get luck and your boom arm will have reasonable tension unlike mine.
5,Don't bother with any of the others. They will break and you will have to buy another. And that will break.This one won't. It has everything you need and is a beast. Holds up a Blue Yeti Pro AND Blue shock mount without issue. Stays where I put it.
1,After 3-4 years of holding a Shure Sm7B this unit made a loud "CLANK!!!" and collapsed like a wet noodle. The mic was fine but upon inspection the PLASTIC cable guide appears to have bit the dust. No spare parts appear to be available and it seems the warrenty for most Blue products was 3 years. Would Go with the Gater unit YellowTek something better than this.
5,Does everything you want and is well built and good looking couldn't be happier with this boom.
5,it works great a little stiff to place but it holds well.
1,I don't think ive ever written a 1 star review or have been genuinely so dissapointed in a product. No matter what i do the mic arm sags. ive watched counteless videos and still nothing helps. my fingers are almost bloodied trying to tighten this damn thing. Please Please PLEASE save yourself the time and get another mic arm. Let this be your warning
5,the stand doesnt let you go way to far thats unless if its not that heavy
5,I don't like the look of the 'two arm' type boom.  I'm not sure why but they just look cheap to me.  The solid single body has a very solid sturdy look and with the Shure mic I use it works perfectly.
3,Hard to Tighten the knobs
1,This mic stand could never hold my mic in the correct position. Even after adjusting the tension over and over to try and get it to hold the mic in the correct position it would just not stay in place. Probably the biggest waste of money I have spent. I would just get a regular mic stand if you want one. This is not worth the cost already even if I got a working one.
2,This is a replacement Boom and so far it seems better than the last Except for the Base joint that seems impossible to set in any position no matter how hard I try to tighten the twist lever. The twist lever itself is insufficient to tighten because it is very shallow in the joint and with a very strong spring it's like a heavy weight fight to get it to stay in position. This should not be a problem for such a great looking boom. Now I don't need to adjust it much but that is besides the point I should be able set it in any position I want. I am going to see is the spring settles down a bit but if not I will be returning it and looking for another brand.
5,Set up can take a bit make sure you watch Wild4Games video on how to set it up it saved me aggravation and thinking it was a piece of dookie.  Hint the tension screw drastically changes how this thing works.  Works great get a shock mount no noise transferred from the desk...
4,Very silent swivel; tension rod adjusting is way too taunt and has to be trained to be in a position. God forbid you rearrange your desk
1,I thought I got a defective unit but after getting a replacement it appears they are all like this. The center joint lock will not tighten sufficiently and the arm will not stay in place. You can put it where you want it and it will just keep re-extending itself. It should be noted that this boom is spring-loaded and it is designed to naturally straighten itself out if you loosen the clamps... but the center clamp won't tighten enough to keep it in place so as soon as I let go of it it starts creeping back out. I can't take pliers to it or it'll likely break the clamp... and I shouldn't have to anyway. Also the base swivel has no lock on it at all so you cannot lock it in place once you get the rotation where you want it. I'm pretty disappointed I thought spending this much money would get me a decent boom but it's no good to me if it won't stay where I put it. It really is a shame too because it appears to be built very well other than the problems with the clamps not working.
5,Definitely worth the money!  Best mic boom I have found
5,I am very happy with this product. It's very well made. It took some time (and serious effort) to get it loosened enough to stretch where I needed it to be. Tightening it was also similarly difficult. However now that it is setup it is sturdy and definitely not moving! I'm quite pleased with the overall construction and materials.
5,High Quality Versatile Mic Boom. I use it with a Blue Yeti with no issues.
5,Bought a chip arm it bent this is amazing quality and functionality! Longer length also. Great but.
3,I do like the looks and hiding the cables is an extra nice touch. However it is difficult to get it to say in the exact position you want it to. As others have written you have to have strong wrists/hands/fingers to tighten it enough to stay in place. Directions are minimal and customer service doesn't answer emails. For $100 I expected more instructions and support.
5,Very sturdy even when stretched out all the way. Dont waste money on cheaper stuff.
5,It is great quality and it is better than any cheap scissors stand you could get.
5,The holder is perfect the feeling is the best honestly. 100% recommendable.
5,This arm costs $400+ from other vendors. But Blue made incredible work. Take with no worries.
1,I had ordered two of these mounts and both came defective and when i got my replacement it was also defective it didn’t lock in the position i wanted it in and would move up everytime this seller is selling defective units on purpose cause this is not right.
5,Easy to install and works without any adjustments.
5,Great product ! Better have kind of heavy mic but still does the trick with a SURE MV7
1,Love that its metal and love how it looks....that's about it. I'm currently on my second one and both spring mechanisms are trash. The lowest above the base works fine but the center one not matter how much you tighten it will not stay where you put it. I've resorted to using a string to connect the two end so it will actually stay at a 90deg angle. I'm just going to do a full return and try a different brand
5,Works great for mics and I even have one for my DSLR camera. I can hold a lot of weight.
5,Way nicer than cheap and cheerful mic arms especially for something as heavy as Yeti
1,I go to the gym everyday I don't think I'm weak by any means but this product is literally impossible to position correctly. If you don't have Zeus level strength good luck trying to get this mic arm to stay in place. I've tightened it as much as possible to the point where I dislocated and bruised my thumb and fingers and the thing still flys up. 1 star cannot return this fast enough I never write reviews but this product was so bad that I had too. It's a shame because it looks good aesthetically but it terms of actual function this is a negative 3 stars literally below 0  very bad I wouldn't recommend
1,Like many other users I was unable to adjust the spring tension so that the arm did not just lift my mic every time I let go of the adjustment.  The spring tension is just way way too strong.I adjusted the tensioner plastic clips I adjusted the screw on the bottom of the stand. I even took that bottom screw and plate off on the bottom and the mic stand moves almost straight up with the mic attached.  My mic is over 2lbs so almost at the max for this stand and it can't keep the stand down.The screw on the bottom didn't change the tension at all.  I ended up tightening the plastic adjuster so tight it broke and bent the brass washer and even at its tightest it did not stop the stand from just going back to almost straight.
5,works for what i need it to do.
1,As others in the reviews have pointed out getting the tension just right on this boom arm is a chore. I already knew about the tension screw on the bottom and used that to set it up when I first got the arm. It has been close to a year now and I can say that this arm just isn't worth it. Yesterday the bottom tension knob completely gave out and almost slammed my Rode Podmic into my desk. This boom arm just isn't well thought out for the price you are paying and there are other alternatives that hold up better.
1,I bought this arm to attach to my Blue Yeti microphone which the product is designed for and no matter what I did the arm was impossible to get to stay in one position. I removed the tension screw tightened the tension screw loosened the knobs tightened the knobs adjusted the position of the mic moved the arm and nothing would get this mic to stay remotely near my mouth without moving.I can tell this is a nice product I love the look and the cable threading but the arm was borderline unuseable for the short time that I had it.
5,This is incomparable it’s incredible.
5,Purchased as a Christmas gift...was installed immediately and performs up to his expectations. He loves it!
1,I was so happy to finally get this arm pulled it out of the box and started setting it up on my desk. Once I put my mic on it I started to adjust the tension because it was just springing back up after about 45 seconds of fiddling the dial just broke off and wont go back on. now I have 0 tension on the middle joint straight to the trash can and a waste of $100
1,Feels of good quality. However snapped just by extending out across my desk at the joint. Cheap plastic on the inside is the problem. The outside feels strong. Not worth $99 in my opinion.
3,The arm adjustments don't get tight enough and I'm always having to tighten them all the time as they seem to get loose as the arm is moved around.
5,Solid for holding your dslr or any other device.
4,First one I got stopped supporting my yeti after 3 days and had to be replaced. Got a free replacement for it and it's great.
5,Does the job for a Shure SM7b great.
2,It feels to be built sturdy but no matter what I do I can’t get it to not bounce back up. It won’t stay in place and I know I’ve read other reviews that there’s an inconsistency issue where sometimes something is wrong with the middle of the arm’s tension. Don’t feel like spending another $100 to find out though
5,Very happy with this purchase. Premium feel and looks good with my setup
5,The best mic arm to the moment
5,Excelente
1,I have a blue yeti mic and love it. Decided to get this to save desk space. However upon opening I was pretty disappointed to find it's build quality was sub par considering the price tag. I was willing to look past that however as the mic arm itself does not look cheap and it felt sturdy enough. Upon setup the arm refused to stay in place. Even when tightened it would slowly "creep" upwards regardless of how I adjusted the joints or tension. Without any previous indication of item failure one of the joints popped open while I was trying to tighten it effectively breaking the whole arm. It's sad that what could be a quality item is ruined by a poorly designed tightening system.
5,This boom arm is great for the money I think it looks much better than the RODE arm for the same price. Looks great on camera and holds the mic well. It does take some strength to adjust it depending on the angle but other than that I love it so far.
1,My husband and I are pretty big Blue fans. We love their mics so I figured their mic arm would be the best bet for my husband as a Christmas gift. He opened it tested it out with the Yeti X and shock mount and the arm never stayed in place. It would constantly drift. The material it was made out of seemed cheap and not very sturdy like it would break easily. Not a huge fan all around.
1,Really wanted to love this. It feels premium and looks great but like all the other reviews mention something is very very wrong with the tension. Even with the tension screw falling out of the bottom and the hand tension screw as tight as I can get it without breaking it it STILL can't hold my 1.5lb mic AND a 2lb bag of trail mix I sat on top.Just to be clear - the problem is really in range of motion. The middle joint can't be bent to less than around a 80 degree angle without it springing back against 3.5 lbs of weight. The $15 arm this was supposed to replace holds my mic steady at any position it can be bent.If you really want a tube arm I'd suggest saving yourself the headache and buying something more premium to begin with.
2,Arm tensioning was not readily adjustable to accommodate the Elgato Wave 3 microphone.  Screw at base was at minimal and joint adjustments at maximum and the arm still would not hold a stable position.  Arm would slowly move back to upright position.I was also disappointed in the plastic cable covering.  I expected it to more sturdy for the price.
4,Not so easy to move around as I thought it would be but the stand does just enough.
5,This arm is perfect. :) highly recommended
1,I have ordered 2 of these and both have the same issue where the middle tension screw will not keep the arm in place and keeps rising. Even after loosening the bottom spring tension screw the arm still raises with mic on the arm.I would love this mic arm if that was fixed as it feels great. Just cannot use it since it doesn't hold position.
5,Starts to sag with a heavy weight on it above 3.5lbs
5,This was better than my previous 12 dollar purchase but that is obvious for the cost difference. It is very sturdy and well constructed. I like the swivel on the bottom it lets me easily swing the arm out of the way when I don’t need it.
1,I am writing this after just over a year of use. The arm is easy on the eyes but that is where the quality behind this product stops. It has had a Blue Yeti attached for the entire life and has really just been in one spot. I came into my office to find it completely slumped over and no longer holding tension.As this product comes with a two year warranty I called Blue. They don't have anyone staffing their customer care via phone which is very frustrating. I was referred to their website to submit a ticket. We are on day three with ZERO response from Blue.If you want a mock stand you can use and not just look at I would encourage you to look elsewhere as my experience has been negative.Update: 6 days with zero response from Blue Support
5,It works very well for my blue bluebird
2,I've used other spring-loaded mounts for many years (decades actually) and this is a really slick looking mount however the only gripe is that it seems to have an issue with not wanting to stay put! I don't have a super heavy mic only a Stellar X2 but even with my RE20 the arm insists on jumping up which isn't good in any way. I've tightened down the screws but how far do you have to put them before you get results until they can't go anymore! Overall nice looking but needs a little improvement.
1,I have an audiotechnica 2020+ usb and it cant support the weight at all. I have to loosen the bottom and tighten everything to the extreme to get it to stay where I want and even then its only a matter of time before it flexes back on its own or if I move it at all it'll start moving out of place. For $100 I should be able to put my mic on fix it to where I want and not ever have to think about it. It looks nice but its cheap and ive seen a lot of people with the same issues.
1,I purchased this boom arm for a simple task... to mount a Blue Yeti (yes same company believe it or not) with a shock mount and either hang from above or lower in an upright position.  The bottom line is while the arm looks great it simply does not work.  Why? The main complaint is the tension of the spring.  No matter how much I loosened the spring tensioner screw in the case or tightened the adjustment the BLUE Yeti Mic (yes same company) would not maintain arm position. The end result is the top part of the arm would always return to position that the spring was pulling.  To top it off I broke the arm while trying to get it to work so I can not return it. So there is $100 down the drain for a product that could not be more worthless. DO NOT BUY THIS ARM!!!! I have a $20 arm that works MUCH better than this one.
5,sturdy easy to setup great looking
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've used this boom arm for 2 and a half years and it's always been a pain. From day 1 I had to tighten the screws as tight as they could go jimmy the arm around until it felt stable enough then let go and hope the arm didn't slowly topple over. This morning I woke up and the base joint couple hold up anymore. For how much this thing costs I can't believe it's such a bad product.
5,Great product works perfect with my Blue Yeti mic in my virtual classroom.
5,This is a well made product.  The clamp to hold the arm is sturdy and will not mark or damage a wood desk. The arm itself is much sturdier than those scissor type.  I do not hesitate to recommend the Blue Compass boom arm.
1,You would think a $100 mic stand would be the last mic stand you buy but this is a piece of junk. The knobs that tighten the stand into position require an excessive amount of force to keep it from sagging. You will hurt your fingers tightening this thing. Yes I have read the instructions and looked up videos about tightening the screw at the base of the stand. The part of the base that attaches to a desk is also cheaply made. It simply does not function well and for a $100 mic stand it should. Horribly designed and any $20 mic stand will function better.
3,The tension even when loosened and mic added to arm is way too strong. It keeps wanting to fold up straight. Hoping it will relax more soon.
1,Bought this to replace a flimsy mic arm I have been using and will start with the 1 negative. The C clamp is made of extremely cheap weak materials on the portion that actually bolts to table it broke after a single use(When I went to move the clamp to new position the metal plate fell to the floor after snapping off. The rest of clamp/Base is extremely tough and durable. The arm itself is awesome you will need to adjust the springs heavily to get the thing to bend to position but it will hold anything you strap to it. Arm is very heavy keep that in mind and make sure you have a solid desk or the edge will be crushed from weight when bending it over table. Have to give this one star until some remediation is done for the clamp though as product is unusable.
5,Had a cheap boom arm for years. Finally decided to shell out the money for a good quality boom arm. Works perfectly with the Radius III and my Blue Yeti. Only downside is how much of a hassle it is to turn the microphone + shock mount to a usable direction for muh face.
5,Love it. Works great and reduced my desk clutter.
5,Not only looks amazing but also holds my Rode PodMic like a Champ. Added bonus wasn't aware of built in cable tuck.
1,If I could leave no stars I would this thing is the absolute biggest waste of money ever I’ve had it 3 maybe 4 days since the first time out of the box it wouldn’t tighten enough to hold the microphone at the angle I needed I messed with the wire inside tension I’ve dont everything to try to make it right well today I went to tighten it down a little bit more in order to get it to hold and pop the plastic turn knob they use to tight down snapped free from the headless screw inside of the joint and now I have to wait on another one to be sent to me. The bad side is this is the best option on the market and also the biggest piece of junk at the same time. I wouldn’t buy it if you can keep from it but since you won’t find a better one you might as well get an extended warranty?
1,As others have said it looks great. It’s solid. However it literally is non functional with any microphone except the blue yeti because of microphones weight. You cannot freely position the stand where you need it because the tension is way too tight. For 100 please pass. My 20 boom arm looks worse but is actually functional. Can’t same the same about this one.
1,I DO KNOW about the tension screw on the bottom but it works only for the base part the middle know is where the problem is (multiple reviews here also on reddit). If you need middle to be lower than 90 degree you need to tighten up the middle knob very-very hard and it is still going up. Base part and the last knob work perfectly. I have mounted Blue yeti on it with and without shockmount middle part still goes up. I managed to add a little wieght and tighten middle part very hard but it still give me issue after i move it around.Would give more stars but it doesnt work as described at all. Support is unreachable also. Again issue is popular - just google it and you will find multiple portals with posts about it.
5,Great Microphone mount comes with adapters
5,It’s looks sleek and professional. Sturdy and steady. Worth the extra $$
1,I could’ve spent a fraction of the price for a very cheap desk mounted mic stand if I wanted to just have it break on me. I’ve had this particular stand for about 4 days. And I’ve used it once. Already the tension doesn’t work in the middle of the arm itself. It always tries to reorient itself as if it weren’t screwed in at all. The flat disc that touches your desk after twisting the wing nut shattered. Meaning it won’t even connect to a desk now. I saw the company name and expected a great high quality product. I got a heavy duty product with design flaws that doesn’t even perform. With a nice name on it nonetheless.
5,This is priced a little higher but for good reason. Really easy to assemble. PLEASE NOTE - there is a tension screw at the bottom and it makes the adjusting easier. High quality and good chord management.
1,Sadly like the rest of the world I found that the middle joint was not able to be controlled to my liking... even with adjusting the tension screw. I was therefore unable to position my mic to my desired location. 45 minutes from unboxing to return.
5,This is best boom arm ever! Seriously I just opened a podcast studio in tampa florda called podcast ninja and it looks much more professional than the PSA1 plus if you use the Amazon basics cable it should spin all the way around will a little muscle.
5,It’s exactly what I wanted! Since I’m a streamer it’s perfect for gameplay and it really keeps my microphone off the desk so I have more space. Really would recommend to get this instead of something cheap that won’t last as long.
5,Product was flexible and accommodated my microphone perfectly.  Am very happy.
5,super nice and quality look and feel
5,Solid construction. Easily portable as well.
1,I bought this because I have a Blue Yeti and I thought well this was made for the Yeti so it must be ok. Wrong! After I managed to clamp it down and plug in my Yeti it was time to position the mic to my liking and what a joke that was. Once I got the mic in position I went to tighten up the knobs to hold it in place and the Boom Arm kept raising and that's finger tight. So I got a wrench to tighten the arm even more and after many rotations finally got the mic to stay...that lasted a week. Then the arm raised again so after loosening everything all over again and began to tighten and after 5 days being in place the arm began to give way. So this time I just tightened up so more and the cable broke. Do not waste your money on this!
5,Clean look and style. I like the built-in cable management. Works great. Nice quality.
5,I like it easy to install and very sturdy.
5,Glad that I have found this. Loving it
5,real nice
1,I watched about 6 or 7 youtube videos regarding setup.  IT IS CRUCIAL you set the mic up well.  Once it's dialed it operates pretty well. I bought it for the sleek look since we started filming our podcast.  i purchased two and one just bit the dust and the other is already on it's last legs.  I mention that I bought two so you can be sure i didn't just get a lemon.  Both are failing at the same point.  The spring inside the main hinge.  We have it properly tensioned.  it's not the screw on the bottom.  That's been dialed since day one.  We only use the same mics on them.  We do however use them every day.  This is where they fail.  They just don't hold up.
1,The hand screws on this boom arm simply don't work to keep the mic in place. They are way too difficult to screw in and no matter how far I go the arm continues to lift the mic out of position.Build material is nice but the item is way too difficult to use and adjust appropriately to be useful.
1,This thing is obviously built really well feels incredibly sturdy and I loved the sleek look of it immediately after unboxing. The problem as many others have mentioned is that the spring mechanism inside this thing is so incredibly strong. Too strong. It feels as though it was meant to attempt to hold up a cinderblock or something. Any attempt to adjust it where it wanted or needed it to be resulted in it springing back up to wherever it felt like going. Regardless of how forcefully I tried to tighten the joints to lock it in place.Overall fantastic quality but it would be great if it was actually usable for a standard mic.
5,This have completely changed the way I stream and I don't regret a penny. Solid metal cabel channel built in 360 degree rotation no sounds when moving it. It is truly studio quality. If you are looking for a nice arm get this NOW!!!
1,again hosed by youtubers these compays pay to review garbage way too short to even clear a 27 inch 4k monitor much less my samsung g7 32 standard size desk tension was useless or broke on item if you have a profession set up ignore these mounts or add a 10 inch high block of wood to you desk to clear a standard monitor if you have a tiny desk with a 24 inch monitor or attaching it to the side of the desk not the back this might work but if thats the case you have a small average set up that will not require wasting 100$ on this what a waste of time.
1,I this was intended to be a boom arm for my Blue Yeti. Unless you have an extremely heavy rig going onto this arm I don't recommend it. With just my Yeti on the arm it will never stay in place. Always reverts back to straight upwards. I loosened the tension as much as possible. I tightened the locks on the side. Still too much tension to do anything. It's a sleek looking arm and was looking forward to it. Unfortunately this will have to be returned.
5,I’m happy with it even though I still like my PSA1. This is just cleaner.
5,I was having problems keeping my mic up Other stands just couldn’t keep my Aston Spirit microphone up. But this stand solved my problem. Now I can keep my mic up without having it leaning on the table
1,This mic stand looks beautiful in the photos. Way nicer than the metallic standard scissor arms.... so I bought it. The material of the arm is nice but the problem is: the mic arm comes in a vertical position. In order to bend it and adjust the arm to where you want it to be there are little twisty knobs in the side... the knobs are not strong enough to hold the position. No matter how tight you twist them the arm will snap back and sim straight up in the air. Eventually you will get tired of this and try to tighten the knobs using pliers... sounds like a plan. But the knobs and threading are made of plastic and they will strip before getting tight enough to hold position. This product should not even be sold. You will return it after ordering. Trust me
1,I compare this arms durability with a $20 no name scissor arm. I have an AT2020 mic. In the shock mount it's 14 ounces. This arm was constantly lowering itself. No matter what kind of tension settings it would slower lower itself over the course of an 8 hour stream. I was constantly having to get up and tighten the arm. The dial to tighten is made of plastic and attached to a metal screw. The plastic broke and there is now no way to get tension to try and hold the arm still. 11 months old and it's now useless. I do not recommend this AT ALL!
2,First time i broke the mid adjustment nob  while trying to tight it  an arm made of aluminum and robust material ? Well throw it the trash cuz you will break the plastic nobs  also it stupidly big and will take a big space of the disk despite being designed to mount an anvil rather than Few grams of an actual mic  the arm is difficult to adjust and set up  it wont stay on any different position rather than the one you bust you finger for
2,Regardless of positioning this product does not hold its shape. You can crank down the screws all you want it will still straighten out every single time and for the money I expected a lot more.Awful do not buy.
5,Very sturdy and works perfectly with the sm7b
5,Works well pretty strong and durable.
4,Even loosened the springs seem too tight ... it will not bend past 90 degrees.
1,Couldn't get the boom arm in position when tightening the middle thumb screen and it eventually just flat out broke. The thumb screw then felt loose and just kept spinning with no tightening effect. Sending in for a replacement because this feels like a crappy unit but I'll give it one more chance.Edit to original review: I'm convinced the first one they sent me was broken and refurbished because there were visual marks on the joint points from tension. The second product shipped to me broken all the same because I again had to tighten the knobs with a wrench since they would not stay tightened and on the first attempt the thumb screw  popped off. Never giving this product a chance again. If I didn't use any kind of assistance like a wrench my thumbs would definitely be bleeding like the other reviewers.
1,They could easily tell you that in order to get this thing even remotely working you will need possibly the heaviest mic on the planet and then some. The documentation is a complete joke and doesn't help at all.They say up to 2.4 pounds... yeah find me a mic that weighs that much an SM58 is 0.6 pounds and SM7b is 1.6 pounds. This thing is more like a medieval catapult than a boom arm.There's videos online of people not even getting it working with Blue's own microphones that are paired with this.Plus the obnoxious ugly blue logo is much brighter and noticeable than it is in the pictures.I don't know how anyone got this working. Thank you for wasting people's time Blue (Logitech).Never wanted to return anything so quick.
5,Slightly different to the Rode PSA1. You can articulate it and then tighten the joints to keep it in that positions no matter if there's a mic attached or not. Works amazingly my first Rode PSA1 broke a couple months into using it.
2,The short time that I have used this arm it already sags with the slightest of movement.Microphone used is the rode procaster.I have the pivot points tightened all the way
1,The Joints to this are a pain to turn and eventually they just break after 3 months. For 100 bucks just to throw this away makes me really angry. I Hate this purchase! Garbage. I really liked this arm but the tension tabs to tighten and loosen the wire is made of plastic! It looked professional and was a product I looked deeply into cause I refuse to purchase a 20 dollar boom arm. I hope I can get a replacement if this is a manufactures snafu. Please this was so expensive to just last a few months!
2,For a $100 not worth it. Tensioner is already broken and won't keep the upper part arm bent. Just recieved it and it's already broken within 15mins.
5,Well built and worth the money.
5,the best boom arm in the world for home use. I used some brands before but this one - its the best one.
5,I love this
1,I bought this a lil past a month ago and have been using this mic arm and this thing is a piece of trash. For 100$ and readjusting it only a few times for changing setups this arm just broke on me and pieces of the arm just popped out after tightening it for the last time. Currently it's staying up because of the two monitors supporting it from falling down but the knock off versions that are like 8-15$ ARE SO MUCH BETTER even if you can't 360 those knock off/cheap ones they at least lasted me over 5 months of use before I swapped to what I thought was a "Better Boom Arm" Do NOT buy this mic arm. I have to use my monitor to hold this 100$ junk up 😡
5,Very well built compared to other options. Sturdy springs and construction. Easy to adjust and works great with my Blue Yeti.
5,perfect
5,Works great. Holds it's position without constant adjustment.
5,Good product
1,IF YOU CONSTANTLY MOVE YOUR BOOM ARM THEY GET LOOSE OVERTIME THEN YOU TIGHT THEM UNTIL TO THE POINT THERE IS NO POINT CAUSE THEY JUST SNAPPED. wtf I HAVE CONTACTED BLUE TWICE WITHIN 2 MONTHS AND HAD REPLACED IT... SO I HAVE BOUGHT ONE HERE AS WELL AND IN JUST 3 DAYS THEY SNAPPED. JEEEZZZ WHAT IS GOING ON. SO IN REALITY 3 BROKE THE ONE I BOUGHT HERE LUCKILY IT WAS STILL UNDER RETURN POLICY BUT THE 2 I BOUGHT FROM ZZOUND BROKE AFTER 1 MONTH AGAIN LUCKY BLUE COMPANY IS GOOD WITH WARRANTY AND RETURN MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A RECIEPT.
1,Despite all the negative reviews claiming the joints were faulty I purchased this brand at the recommendation of a friend. Right away I could see what everyone is talking about; the arm bends backwards nearly inverted from the product picture to which you bend to the desired position and turn join knobs. These knobs on the joints are killing my fingers and eventually had to use a wrench. Despite that the springs are so faulty that they snap the arm back into the inverted position no matter how tight. It sprang in the other direction so fast it almost smashed my livestreaming monitor above. I can't imagine a way this would benefit anyone as is. All of these reviews are either defective units or this is truly one of the worst mic stands on the market.
5,Works great holds position. A bit bouncy though depending on how far you extend the arm from the mount point.
5,Best boom arm in the market in my opinion.
5,Super easy to setup and right out of the box this thing performs well. I have the yeti on this and wherever I move the arm it stays. Very happy with this.
5,The perfect
2,The tension screws don't hold the mic in place all that well it's not a bad as some make it out but it wants to get back to the straight position all the time. My problem was the base and weight distribution. I have a brand new table from Ikea which I thought was "solid" wood. Turns out it's easily breakable. if the arm had better weight management (it also always "swung" back to a base spot as well) I wouldn't have a broken table.
2,Broke rather quickly. I returned it. For the price you would think it would be more durable. The materials FEEL good but they obviously don’t line up with real durability.
2,What can I say? It looks great. The design is nice. The springs are probably strong enough to lift my car. There was simply no way to put it in place adjust it and then have any confidence it would actually stay in place. Even mounted to the desk the springs were strong enough to wrench it off the side. Maybe with a permanent mount it wouldn't be so bad? Don't know. Going to look at other options. Shame. I really liked it
4,Very good
3,I have tightened the hell out of the locking tabs and still the arm constantly moves up and straightens out.
1,Even with the tension screw loosened as much as possible and the hinges tightened as much as possible this boom arm is unable to maintain its position when used with the Blue Yeti Nano. Will be returning and looking for something else.
5,The Blue Compass Premium Broadcast Boom-Arm is wonderful!!!I would purchase nothing else it is the perfect fit for my Home Recording Studio.It will be for yours too take my word for it!!I'm loving it!
2,I could never get it to stay in place where i wanted it.  The tension was too tight and when tightening down the middle join it popped displaying the lesser quality of this product at a quality product price.
1,sadly even though it looks really nice it doesnt function properly. the most important component the adjustable levers are plastic and will not lock the device in place so wherever you place your mic it slowly drifts away. absolute trash DO NOT BUY would give 0 stars if i could. complete waste of $115 dollars probably why it lowered to $90 now.
1,Absolute trash. Bought literally less than 5 months ago. And while trying to adjust the top arm (which is so very difficult as everyone has mentioned) the adjusting knob got marred and both the knob and the holder cap on the opposite end literally fell out causing my SM7B to just go BOOM crashing on the desk as the arm went limp. Not wroth the investment at all.
1,Tried two.  Neither would stay in position.  Tried the tension screw at the bottom as well.  Looked online and same issue.  Have to get lucky and get one that is made correct from what it sounds like.
5,Fantastic compass highly recommend
1,This is the second time I've purchased this product - I should have learned my lesson. I used this originally with a Yeti Blue XLR mic. The center knob / tension is not strong enough to "lock" in the position. So you end up over-tightening it and stripping / breaking the knob. Bought another one - same thing. Tried it with an Audio-Technica mic same result. Beware my dudes.
1,As some of the other reviewers have noted this boom arm sucks. I have a Rode NT-USB mic which is not light and the mic flies straight up in the air when it's bent in certain directions. Don't let the YouTube videos and other reviews fool you there is not enough tension adjustment to get this to your liking. Only buy this boom arm if you want your mic to be above your head. If you want it to come from an angle below your chin... impossible.
3,Spring action does not stick to the position you want to put it at
5,A little expensive. But if you have the money to spend this mic stand looks beautiful and does its job
1,Absolute trash! The tension on this arm is insane. There is no way to set it up to have low effort mic movement. The thing is always springing straight. The knobs are super cheap. Mine fell off while I battled for a more rigid setup.  Supposedly there is a tension screw at the bottom. Well I loosened it and it was still super tense. Kept going and that came off! Turns out the screw isn’t even attached to anything! The arm is super tense still. So my $100+ boom arm is laying in pieces on the floor. Blue should stick to making mics cause they suck at making accessories. Get the RODE arm. I also own that and it’s been great to me!
1,If you can manage to twist it tight enough so that it will hold it's position don't bump it! If you do it will instantly mess it up and you have to rebreak your fingers to get it sturdy again.I just barely bumped the bottom of the arm and heard a loud *clang*... Game Over for my mic boom. The middle joint won't give anymore resistance no matter how hard you tighten it now.I am usually a fan of Blue items but this boom was rough from the start. Given it's price I was hoping to hang onto this for quite some time. I have had it for 3 months and it is already in the garbage can.
5,This Blue boom arm is exactly the quality I was hoping for perfectly accepting my Blue Yeti Pro and shock Auphonix mount. Smooth operation and solid stability. Highly recommended.
5,I bought this for my Samson G Track Pro. It was simple to put together and the adjustments knobs are easy to set. 10/10 would buy again.
5,Yes
5,Christmas gift for my gaming grand teenager. He added a microphone on it and he loves the set up
5,Works great!
1,This thing is a piece of garbage.I had it less than 2 hours and it was broken. Internal springs too tight in the elbows. If you overtighten they will pop out and then you are screwed because the whole thing just reverts to a position of full vertical extension.  The only adjustable spring is in the base.  If you aren't standing up or installing this on a ceiling so it hangs down from the top don't bother buying it. Especially for the price they are asking.I don't usually write reviews. But this thing is just bad. Run FAR FAR away and find a different boom arm for your needs.
5,This arm works PERFECTLY for my Blue Yeti blackout microphone. Rotation is VERY smooth and the joints are noiseless with variable stiffness. To top it off with a 5th star the construction of this arm is VERY sturdy.
5,This is awesome the only thing I was dissatisfied with was you have to buy the in desk mount separate.
1,This boom arm is junk.  Thanks to Amazon I received my product within 24 hours of purchase.  Kudos to Amazon.  However that was the only part of the experience that was positive.  I opened the packaging and immediately heard the sound of a piece of plastic rolling around inside of the Blue Compass Boom Arm.  The middle pivot joint was already cracked and would not tighten.  Good thing I had enough sense not to put my mic on it and try to use it.  It would have just drooped over and probably broken my mic.  I am definitely returning.  Purchased the Knox Boom arm.  It has better reviews and is half the cost.
1,Bad:- won't correctly loosen the tension- cracks in plastic upon arrivalAcceptable:- Able to make work by turning the middle & table-closest joints so you don't actually leverage those joints they just stay at rest so less tension issue
2,I only bought this arm because its one of the top recommended arms in several articles and Joe Rogan uses them for his show.If your arms never move then these are ok but if you travel and do your podcast mobile this is a waste.The tabs broke almost immediately. Took several uses to break in and the table clamps on two different arms broke immediately.Dont waste $100 on this.
1,highly do not recommend purchasing this boom arm. it is incredibly hard to adjust and maneuver to your personal liking. you find a spot you like and the boom arm simply wont stay still. worst f-ing thing ive ever laid my eyes on. just buy the psa1. it wont look as nice as the blue compass but it will actually do what you paid for.
1,I have a fairly light condensor mic from Audio Technica the AT879R which only weighs 2.8 oz (80g). The tension spring in the Blue Compass arm was simply overpowered to the point the arm would extend straight up. Even loosening the tension spring to the point it came out wouldn't release enough tension.The quality of the arm was top notch however. If I had a much heavier microphone I think the arm would have worked wonderfully and I would be happy with it. As it is I had to return it.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Instead of returning it i just want to break it in half.
5,While expensive its probably the best on the market. Very high quality. If the price was a little lower this would be perfect.
1,Bought this in January 2021 its now August 2021 and the mic arm is broken. It fails to hold up my Podmic (2 pounds) which is under the weight limit. Yes I tightened the weight adjustment screw yes I tightened each of the articulating points. Expected a lot more for $100. Skip this one didn't last any longer than the cheap $25 arm I had prior.
2,can't set the mic into a set position because the middle join doesn't hold.  I'll get it setup  go to sleep and then wake up to the arm being straight.
1,If I were you I would not buy this product. After installation the arm just does not hold the microphone in place (a Blue Yeti) even though I followed the instruction manual. The item looks nice in terms of design but the building materials seem cheap. The knobs (plastic) in the hinges do not tighten enough and the arm does not keep the desired position for the microphone which is of the same company (Blue). In summary the arm is very expensive and does not do what it supposes to. Sadly it is more expensive to send it back to Amazon for a refund (from Colombia) than the item itself. So save your money and invest it in a more classical but functional one (metallic).
1,I moved to a new home and bought this arm because I think it looks clean.I used to use Rode PSA1 and I was very satisfied by its functionality. I used it to support my Neumann TLM 102 and the arm worked great.This Blue arm is my worst experience. After installing the stand to my desk I was trying to mount my mic on it and I immediately noticed that the arm could not support the weight of my mic. It broke after 5 minutes.I don't want to say much about its weird design but I dropped it in the trash chute instead of requesting a return. Totally trash! For the same price please buy PSA1 instead.
5,Great for my large Yeti Pro mic.
1,Overall build quality as far as materials and looks go it’s amazing. My only gripe is that it won’t stay down. I’ve watched dozens of videos on how to fix but none of the solutions work. It seems like I got the short end of the stick on this one.
5,Sooooo much better than one of those wiry cheap ones but not $500 dollars line the professional ones with I’m sure a similar build quality.
2,The arm is too strng and does not stay in place even on the weakest setting.
1,I read all of the reviews about the tension of this arm and decided what the heck I'll try it anyway. Before you say it yes I know about the adjustment screw under the base. It didn't matter how much I adjusted there was way too much tension. As someone ranted about the same problem and with the same mic that I have (MXL 770) which I agree is a decently heavy mic it didn't really matter or make a difference because this arm is packed with a crazy amount of tension. There definitely needs to be some redesign here. The arm looks great but that's the only thing that's good about it.
1,It's very hard to get this thing to stay still after making adjustments. There is some sort of tension cord inside that has too much strength and it move the arm. The instructions mention backing out one of the screws to help with this issue but it didn't work. I ended up breaking the thing by mistake while trying to stop if from moving. Get something else instead.
1,I'm pretty upset that for a $100 arm this thing cracks if you bend it IN A DIRECTION IT ALREADY BENDS. I was flexing the arm back and forth to figure out which direction I was supposed to mount it (it doesn't say in the instructions) and when I looked closely I found that the arm had ALREADY CRACKED in the plastic. WTF? There goes the resell value completely. It does a good job of holding up my Yeti mic and I do have the shock mount and cohesively it all looks great together BUT I'M REALLY UPSET THAT IT ALREADY CRACKED FOR BENDING IT IN A DIRECTION IT ALREADY BENDS IN THE FIRST PLACE. What the heck Yeti? :(
1,I loosen all joints.Position each joint the way I want it.Tighten each joint.And it just bounces back up again.
1,The hinges are held together by very cheap plastic.  While tightening the mid-arm hinge the plastic "screw" broke by finger force alone. It was impossible to set the arm how I wanted it it would slowly straighten itself when left alone for 5 minutes.  Now it's where I want it but positioned via butcher's twine since it's half broken.For the cost of this arm it's just poor quality.  The hinge is put together in a way that makes it very difficult to just simply replace the parts with something more substantial.
1,Broke literally within the first 5 mins of opening up the package was able to fix then literally smacks me in the face with my mic in the middle of a playthrough without warning and when I went to adjust the entire screw for the middle joint just came out and nothing can be fixed. Horrible product! Cabling housing was nice to have.
5,It works as expected. It's stylish. It links well with the shock mount from blue and of course the yeti mic.
1,I have an AT2020 USB but this boom arm didn't work for it. It kept going up and not staying where I want it too. Yes I know about the tension screw in the bottom I tried my best to fix and tightening the knobs from the middle and where the mic is. Then they both broke off completely. The plastic knobs and screws in them broke off and fell off. So my dumb self instead of trying to get my money back I tried fixing it myself. Putting my own screws and gluing everything back but nothing worked. Maybe I had a defected boom arm or not. I will not buy it again. Stick with the Rode PSA1.
1,The Mount is solid until it breaks The Middle Section of the Boom arm has a thumb Tighten Screw which eventually will burst/explode making the whole boom arm un-useableRidiculous that a EXPENSIVE name Brand Boom Arm uses a PLASTIC THREADED TENSION CAP on the MOST VITAL HINGE OF THE ARMLiterally google Broken Boom Arm... there is a guy 3d printing replacments because its so wide spread smh.. I'd buy another but $100 every 20 days is worse than a drug habit
1,This boom arm didn't work well for me at all. It looks pretty but after fiddling with the tension screw several times it only ever seemed to get worse. It would either keep lifting after I positioned my mic or it would droop over time.The design also makes it very easy to bend the arm back in the wrong direction which can damage it and the amount of force to do so it's surprisingly little. I caught myself at the last second before making a catastrophic mistake more than once.I've returned this and got a Rode PSA-1 instead which has been effortless from the start.
5,It works well for my EV RE27 mic and 309 hanger.
2,It is not easy to adjust the position of the microphone. The arm constantly wants to do it’s own thing. The knobs that are supposed to hold it in the desired position are not strong enough.
5,This product is great. Only one complaint the mic doesn’t weigh down the arm enough sometimes
2,The elbow tightening knobs failed after a month. The plastic slotted knob separated from the metal bolt. Can't tighten to a fixed position anymore
1,I absolutely hate this thing ive used it for a year now and it is so frustrating to work with doesn't fit most mics without add ons. The tension in the tube itself has snapped multiple cords inturn snapping off the cheap plastic cord containment system. The bottom desk mount broke within a month or so it ripped of the back coner of my desk. It now just sits in the corner of office. Unless you need a blue for that Instagram status symbol dont bother with this POS.Cheers Neon Slice
1,The stand was perfect for what I needed. After my RODE PSA 1 broke I bought this and really enjoyed the look of this arm over the Rode. Just like my last one it broke after a year. It seems the plastic screw at the base of the boom arm broke or loosened in some way. As a result the arm no longer stays in position when I lower it and will slowly fall all the way down to my desk.At this point I'm buying a $12 arm. If it lasts a year it'll be a massive cut in cost compared to these 2 $100 plastic hinge/screw POS arms.
2,The reason why I don't like this mic arm is that the middle elbow joint never stays in place.  I've tightened it as hard as it can go but if I place it at a 90 degree angle  it will slowly straighten out over time basically turning it into a 2 joint arm instead of a 3 joint .  It's just annoying is all.
5,It’s pretty nice
5,Expensive for a mic stand but one of the best looking and made really well.
5,I was looking for a nice arm similar to the Yellowtec YT3601 and this was exactly what I was looking for! Way better than the Rode PSA1 in my opinion.
1,I admit the quality and look of the arm is great but the functionality of it ruins it for me. It seems like this arm isn’t meant to be low and I find myself constantly fighting to get it to stay down even on the tightest setting.
5,Nice design and built well. It works great with my Yeti and I love the functionality of it.
1,This thing is a disaster right out of the box! No idea what the manufacturer's were thinking but this unit is completely useless and does not work period. It has knobs to turn to set the desired position you want but they are just there for decoration. As soon as you think you got it set how you want it - it springs into action and flings your mic straight up in the air! The damn thing almost popped me in the mouth! Do not buy this at all...
5,For my sons gaming setup works as expected no complaints from him
2,1 year of ownership the only complaint being the screws way too difficult to tighten. Now after 1 year of use it can no longer support the weight of the yeti + blue shock mount. The base screw is as tight as it can be and so are the other tension screws. Terrible value going to try a different stand - waste of $100!
3,Limited reach because they only have a C-clamp. If they simply created a screw down base it could be used by any facility.
1,The unit did not function as it said it would and would not hold in place with the new microphone I purchased. The seller never followed up with me to see what was wrong so that confirmed the company and seller do not care about their customers and just want your money. A great story for channel 7 news!
1,I was excited to finally have this beautiful stand for my Desktop but once i got it out of the box and hooked up my microphone basically flew to the roof. I loosened the Tension rod so much that it came out seeing no difference in the level of tension on the whole stand. Its impossible to get the microphone stand in any position I would want.
2,Does not hold the position I want. Tension screws have been tightened as much as possible and it still just limps over. Good material poor construction not worth 100 bucks
5,Mika mic arms are the only other mic arms that can compare to these and those mic arms are $600
1,Does not stay in the position no matter how much you tighten
1,I wish I had scrolled to the bottom to read the detailed reviews. I had the same experience as others - Even using this with a blue microphone the tension springs are far too strong. I have been unable to get the middle joint to remain at any position other than fully extended even after adjusting the spring to the point where the adjustment knob broke (cheap ABS plastic).
1,The joints are WAYYYYYYYYY too tight. You are meant to turn this locks to loosen or tighten the joints. Well no matter how much you attempt to tighten them the mic will raise up. The joints don’t stay locked because they are way too tight. Any mic smaller than a yeti will be completely unusable in this arm. Awful product. Avoid it.
1,Spring tension is waaaaaayyyy too high. Even with a heavy mic and a shock mount it still springs up when lowered. I loosened the tension screw in the base all the way and tightened the friction plates as much as they would go and it still wouldn’t stay in place. It also swiveled away from me steadily so I would have to use a backstop to prevent it from moving. This boom arm has to require a 3-4 lb mic in order to remotely stay in place.
1,Absolutely piece of garbage!! Complete waist of $100 bucks!! I can’t believe it. I bought this to replace an old crappy $12 sizor arm and this $100 arm broke the same day I bought it!!!! The springs inside the tensioners are so damn difficult to turn and they don’t work properly!!! I kept having to turn the damn thing to hold my mic down. It just wouldn’t stay in place!!!! I tightened it some more so it would try to get it to stay where my mouth was and what do you know. The thing snapped inside!!!! GARBAGE!! I wish I read these reviews before buying this crap. So mad!!!!
1,I realize most of these reviews are fake but I bought this boom arm to avoid having a mic sitting on my desk. The arm is difficult to adjust and the joint fasteners broke with minimal tightening. Blue makes an amazing mic and a ridiculously stupid boom arm.
3,I really like the design but it doesn't hold my microphone up at angle angle besides 90  degrees.
5,easy cable management through the clips on the arm and easily adjusts. I use it for my blue yeti when I stream and it works perfectly.
1,Straightens out no matter how much I reduce the tension spring or add friction. Useless I'm afraid.
5,Excellent boom arms for our podcast. Really cleaned up our table 😂
2,I ordered this to go with Yeti microphone. Really slick design unfortunately the elbows wouldn't tighten to hold in place and the arm kept extending itself with the weight of the microphone on it - even after using a wrench to snug them in place to the point of nearly breaking the tightening tabs.  Returned it will look for something more conventional.
1,The springs are way too strong. I have a Blue Yeti Nano microphone so I assumed a Blue microphone stand would work with it. Doesn't work at all doesn't adjust just sticks out fully extended no matter what I do. I can literally attach weights to it and it still won't come down. Absolutely ridiculous. No idea what microphone this is meant for or why you wouldn't make an adjustable microphone stand. Don't buy this.
1,I just received this stand and I loved the built quality but it has a major flaw. You NEED to have a perfectly flat table. You CANNOT stop it from rotating at the base. How was this a good idea BLUE? how? Please I am gonna sit here and hear you out.So if my table is a bit tilted the stand will swing with gravity.I am returning this.
5,Everything was as expected and as it should be. Beautifully engineered simply works the way it should.
1,The internal spring of this mount is so absurdly high that it cannot be adjusted to make this stand useable. Even with the spring at its loosest setting and the joints tightened as much as possible the mount springs up and will not retain anything close to the desired configuration. I hope that I simply got a defective mount and this is not what the company thinks is an acceptable design.
1,Tension was incredibly tight even with the tension screw and all knobs completely lose. Impossible to use. You’re lucky if you get one of these that’s not too tight or too lose. Terrible quality control. Now I gotta put pants on and return it.
1,This product is great…..However you must have a very heavy mic for you to have a total movement and stay. The spring tension is VERY HEAVY. It is impossible to have the mic low without heavily weighting it.
5,I like the ease of install as well ease of use. My next purchase is the radius. Great company!!!
5,I love this boom arm it's the one they use on the fighter and the kid podcast... so you know it's quality.
3,Great but loosening the tension spring to get exact positioning has been my great struggle.
1,For $100 this mic arm legit dosnt do anything good only cause a hassle do yourself a favor and just go with legit anything else I made the mistake of going with this boom arm and regret it. If you do get it just get ready to lie to yourself or be disappointed
1,Once again blue makes a product out of expensive overweight metal that completely sucks. This mic arm just simply dosnt work. (yes i know about the tension screw that also dosnt work). Unless you have a blue microphone that weighs 15 god damn pounds this thing isnt going to work with your microphone. Any normal weight microphone you use with this thing will cause it to just shoot up towards the ceiling. No matter how much you loosen the tension screw. DO NOT buy this mic arm buy a rode psa1 instead thats what im returning this for.
1,The spring tension overpowers the clamping force form the screws at the 2 pivot points. The tension screw adjusted nothing. This is unusable.
1,The part where you get thumb grips to tighten the arm the twisty swivel things are made of palstic the screws inside the arm are metallic.... so they don't bond togetherAfter tightening the screws a few times the swivel thing broke clean off within a year...
1,Bad bad bad. At least its made out of nice material right? Wrong thing springs up just like every other review on this arm tightened all friction clamps loosened screw underneath the base for tension even took the fricken screw out cause it wouldnt let me loosen it anymore and the tension is still rediculous as can be go with a rode psa1 enough said.
1,Mic arm has way to much tension won’t stay where you want it just floats back up. Ended up stripping out the tension screw to try to keep it where I wanted it.
1,I really wanted to love this as the design and material is top notch. But the problem is the springs are too strong and you can’t place the microphone in certain positions without it springing back up. Doesn’t matter how much I tension the bottom nut or the ones on the side it won’t work. This may work for a heavy microphone but that’s it.
1,Put forth minimal force in attempting to adjust it. Boom arm suddenly broke and fell to pieces destroying my shock mount in the process. Luckily my mic wasn't damaged.I'm out roughly $120 now. I will never be purchasing a product from this company again. This is ridiculous.
1,This is a waste of money... Spend $30 on anything else.  I had a $30 Boom to hold my Yeti X and thought to upgrade and go all Blue... What a waste. It keeps moving on its own and it makes me nervous that it may break the glass on my PC if I'm not careful.Find anything else.
1,The design seems very sturdy however when you try to make adjustments it's as the reviews state the tension arm makes this arm rather useless unless you want the boom to only go up and down. In an out motion isn't stable no matter how much you loosen up the tension adjustment screw. Can be improved by going with steel adjustment rather than plastic know adjustment. It's probably one of the worse purchases I've made and definitely not the money.
2,Your Microphone can't be too light or too heavy since the joints on this never stay where tightened. It looks nice but $30 arms do a better job at staying in place. I'll be keeping it mostly for aesthetic purposes and the fact that it's tall and can go over my computer but boy did Blue really not test this properly.
5,Absolutely love it! Works amazing with the Blue Yeti Microphone! Very strong durable and the length of the arm is incredible!
5,Loved it awesome product recommend it to anyone!
1,One of the knobs broke when I was tightening the friction tensioner down just to be able to keep the mic arm from springing back.
1,I wish I had read the reviews for this item. Mic arm doesn't hold adjustments at all. My finger's are in pain just from attempting to adjust this piece of junk. Save your money and look elsewhere. What a waste of time.
1,Used it with a Blue Nano. The Plastic glued to the metal bolt in the middle fell off after four months of use. Basically the whole design comes down to gluing plastic to a tiny bit of metal. Stupid design. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK BLUE YOU DESIGNED GARBAGE.
1,It broke within the first day I have gotten it!
1,This boom arm is very screwy and will not setup how you want it to. the tension is super high and you can not adjust the tension out so the arm will keep going up and therefore not stay where you want it. I ended up returning it and buying the RODE PSA 1.
1,This isn’t much more than a long bar.  Not much flexibility built well and love the look but not worth the price tag.You get one position out of this bar you can not move it in many different directions nor height positions. Wasn’t impressed and returned it the same day
1,This mic stand looks beautiful in the photos pero No lo compren. The material of the arm is nice but the problem is: the mic arm comes in a vertical positioncheaper arms work better  NO LO RECOMIENDO
1,I got it for a yeti x. I can NOT get it to stay down let alone be easily adjustable. You will hurt your thumbs trying to get it to work. Good luck finding helpful tutorials.
5,Awesome build quality! Used on my shure sm7B for podcasts and pc mic!
1,Never quite worked perfect with the Blue Yeti and shock mount. Lasted around a year and it no longer holds the mic up no matter how tight I get it. Do yourself a favor and invest in the rode boom arm at this same price range. This is actually my second one the first one was defective also.
1,Would not adjust to where I want it to. Recommend a different brand.
1,So hard to adjust tension on bottom that it’s actually impossible. Without being able to bend/adjust the bottom knob the product is useless. Had to return item I’ll have to stick with my cheap microphone stand but I really wanted to upgrade. Sad.
5,It works really well with the blue yeti mic and shock mount. Very durable product.
1,Had for about 6 months lost all tension even in the extra tension screw in the bottom. Tried to re-tighten without overtightening and the screw for the main tensioner pushed out the other side and now the arm has no strength at all. Waste of $100 dollars.
1,Everything about this item does not meet expectations. The quality is cheap the tension springs are cheap and SUPER hard to get right. The build is all cheap plastic and the functionality is just not there. Do not purchase this...honestly I instantly refunded after initial setup.
5,Get’s the job done in style.
1,This product is frustrating as hell. Even with loosening the tension screw to the point it came out it still would rise. I am using an audiotechnica mic so it isn’t very heavy. Ultimately put screw in the joints so it doesn’t rise anymore
5,Works perfectly with my Rode Nt-1
1,Not a good mic arm for light mics the tension knobs do basically nothing no matter how tight I tried to get it (without breaking it) the arm would still rise.all in all with the other reviews in mind I'm going to return it.Get the Rode PSA1 there's a reason you see it everywhere.
5,nice and sturdy clamps right onto desk wire channel is a nice touch aswell
5,Great boom arm.  Doesn't make any noise when moved.  Holds in position very well.
2,Unless you have a 2+pound mic it will not stay put. Tension screw does nothing.
1,I bought this arm to mount a Blue Yeti and managed to break it within 10 minutes. The tension is so high on this arm that the arm kept moving. I tried tensioning more and managed to break the plastic off the bolt on the middle joint. The arm itself is made out of nice aluminum but the other parts are pretty crappy plastic. The tension screw that some people talk about doesn't work that well and my mic is still moving around.
5,Much swivel much nice
1,Yeah it looks nice and all but the arm doesn't give good tension and will spring back up straight. I've tighten the crap out of the plastic and it feels like I'm gonna break it which I almost did. Don't waste your money on this just buy a regular scissor boom.
5,Works Great Looks Great!
5,I’ve used a couple mic boom arms and this one is definitely the best value for money.
5,Good overall arm. Works perfect with the yeti mic and other mics.
1,Springs are extremely overpowering. I attached my el gato microphone to the boom arm and when I let go it shot it through the ceiling. Neither Joint adjustments or screw adjustment on base will fix this problem.
5,I have two of these and they work beautifully for my Theology Unfiltered podcast.
5,It works Flawless I really do recommend people to get this Boom arm.
1,I waited so long for this item after reading its good reviews. I just received the boom are and immediately at opening the item I loosened the knobs and tried to install it but once I tightened the knobs the arm bent right back into its normal position. I am so dissatisfied with this product or maybe I just received a defective one. Now waiting to get my refund after putting back in the box.
1,As others have said I was unable to tension this down enough to stop it from just popping back up (even with a heavy Blue Yeti on it). I did try the tension screw at the base. Trying to tighten the elbow further ended up with a stripped screw and now I have a useless mic arm.
1,I’m a Twitch/YouTube streamer. I bought this because it looked better than the RODE desk swing arms that everyone is using now. BIG MISTAKE. The arm won’t stay down no matter what and the base won’t stay locked in position either! It will slowly swing down and the arm won’t stay past 90 degrees. I’ve twisted the dials as tight as possible and doesn’t help at all. Terrible product especially considering the price. You’ve been warned!
5,Clean design and quiet operation.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             terrible product. doesn't tighten properly its tension is way to strong. as i was tightening the middle joint the hardware failed and pushed through the other side. do not buy
5,Wish it was cheaper  but it feels high quality
1,So I got this product expecting a solid sturdy mic arm for the price. It has two locking points on it so you can lock it in place. Not only do these not work but they ... dont work.  My mic almost fell on me while I was just sitting there it started to fall. I do . not recommend this product if you are using a Samson G Track Pro.
1,Feels very cheaply made should be sold for $25. Arm wouldn't stay in any of the positions I placed it in. Immediately returned.
5,Super sturdy maybe too sturdy? But love it
5,Worth the higher price imo. Looks awesome and easier to maneuver than the cheaper boom arm.
5,Very slick looking boom arm and is very easy and convenient to use. Super sturdy too.
5,Amazing value.
1,For $100 you should receive higher a quality boom arm. Tension dial broke off due to cheap plastic. If you are looking for a premium boom arm try the Rose PSA1 or Frameworks Boom Arm. Even cheaper $30-$50 arms are made better than this one.
1,I ordered 2 of these (returned both) and there is no way to get the arm to stay bent the screw doesn't work. The first one was clearly broken when I popped open the cap at the midpoint its all plastic inside and was snapped so nothing to hold it and the second one didn't work either so I just returned it. Cheap and worthless.
1,while putting this together the center joint tension knob sheared completely free and the knob popped off. I havent even used this thing yet but the mic kept bouncing back out of place. I shouldn't be able to shear a knob off by hand... this is some BS.
1,I just got this mic arm today and right out off the box it had tension problems. The second wheel would not put any tension on arm to hold it in place and while tightening it the outer snapped off and it doesn’t tighten or loosen anymore. So yeah safe to say I’ve requested a return
5,Awesome product for blue yeti mic. Works great and easy to set up.
1,Pros- This device was beautiful looking- Has an integrated cable line- Flat attachment bracket to place against a wallCons- BROKE 21 days after purchase...If you consider getting this device know its internal mechanisms or tightening screws can potentially just collapse or break. This boom arm collapsed and hit my screen bezel thankfully it caused only a small scratch.
1,The locks fail to properly secure the arms in place.  The top lock seems fine but the bottom and middle locks slowly lose tension and cause the arms to lose positioning.  Very disappointing.  I have a Blue Yeti microphone and I was hoping to purchase a boom arm without worrying about compatibility.  Unfortunately the quality just isn't there yet.  I'll try something else until Blue (hopefully) refines this product or releases a revised model.
1,Well.. that was a complete waste of money. This mic would never stay in place. If you bend it and tighten the joint... it just straightens right back out. If you dont have a really heavy mic... this stand will not stay where you put it.
5,Best by far
1,You truly cannot adjust this stand. The stand actually broke mid section while trying to adjust it. It is just a bolt connected to a piece of plastic screwing tension to adjust. The worst design they possibly could have went with. Go with a cheaper $20 option. WAY BETTER IN EVERY WAY. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE
1,I can't figure out why but one night the arm bent and could no longer lift my mic anymore!  I love the design of this arm anyone has the same experience as me?
5,Functions well and looks slick. Love it with my Blue Yeti Mic.
5,Durable great. Holds my AT perfectly.
5,Make sure you read the instructions
1,Was working on updating my home work station decided to drop a little more on this item because it was blue. I have had it for less than 7 months and the thing already broke. Disappointing because it was hardly moved and to reposition this and the item to break over that period of time with light use I was unimpressed
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The bottom friction hinge with the Blue logo failed after about 3 months of use.  Check out the video.  I have the hinge tightened all the way and it can no longer hold the Blue Yeti microphone in place.  The other two friction hinges are fine.I replaced it with a Rode PSA1 for the same $99 price tag and it’s so far working great.
2,It looks great but the damn thing won’t stay in place. The tension screw isn’t powerful enough to keep it from returning to its packaged position. This is very disappointing and I will be returning.
5,A little hard to adjust. But works as expected
1,I don't know where to start. Makes for a good clean setup (if it works). Loosen my tension screw to the point where it almost came out and it did nothing for the second (middle) knuckle.  Just get the PSA 1 from Rode. A lot less headaches.
2,Made of great quality but then mic arm even if tighten down at the hinges wants nothing more than to go straight which is a constant bother. Would highly recommend looking at other options before this one
5,Great product recommended for any streamers/broadcasters out there and want a sleek look!
1,Springs are too strong and it is impossible to get it to remain in one position. I actually broke mine - brand new - trying to adjust the arms to quit springing back. If you have heavy mics and pop filter it *might* be okay but my mike is lightweight so could not even get it close without breaking one of the adjustment elbows.
1,unfortunately this looks too good to be true. great style terrible movement & functionality. it will not stay in place continuously slides/falls down. will not hold its position. far better looking than the rest of the mic stand mounts on the market but works far worse. don’t waste $100 on this.
1,This thing is trash. There is so much resistance when angling it that it literally flew back the opposite direction and cracked the plastic. It's unusable now. Will be returning it and buying a real arm instead of this garbage. Should've just spent the extra money in the first place.
5,Decent
5,Yes
5,4 months later review still working perfect
1,Does not support the Blue Yeti mic without drooping no matter how much you tighten the arm points.  I tried 2 of these thinking the first one just might be defective nope they just stink.  I went with a Rode PSA1 and it works flawlessly.  Save yourself some aggravation and don't waste your time with this one.
5,Great!
5,Great product easy to install. Fast shipping
1,the middle hinge broke where you adjust tension. It's held on by cheap plastic and now just rotates freely.
5,Very high quality and perfect design
1,Very cheap. The tension screws are plastic and will not hold my Yeti mic. They will not tighten enough to keep the arm in position. I have read the other reviews on here so I am not sure if I received an older version but I would not recommend this product.
1,After about a months of use - it will stop holding it's place and opens all the way up. Will not allow you to tigten it back.....  NOT WORTH THE MONEY!
1,Its seldom that i dislike something so much.... this is one of those thingsits falls apart hard to use and all around not worth the money
1,I bought this item but was sent a $20 dollar knockoff that looks nothing like what is pictured. It also came damaged.
1,Got this boom arm and it was really good for about a month until one of the joints completely broke on me. Not to mention I would have trouble keeping them tightened and would have to readjust the joints every single day. Don't bother with it
5,Love love love
1,Please go watch youtube reviews. It shows why this product is impossible to set up.
1,I bought three of these mic arms for my podcast studio. Two of the three have broken within our first 3 recording sessions. The joints are so inflexible and completely fell apart. Flimsy cheap and rigid to the point of ridiculous. Very disappointed in these.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Can't even use this product. Broke in 20 min of opening it. Cheap materials.
1,It would not hold the weight of the microphone.Total disappointment
1,The C clamp is worthless. Washer snapped on first tightening. The springs inside this thing are way too tight. Nearly impossible to tighten as needed. Will not work with any sort of bevel on your desk. Great idea - terrible engineering.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 No matter how hard I tighten the bottom joint it can not support the weight of the blue yeti and droops down. After buying a real mic boom there is no reason to ever but this one at 100$. Please please pleeeease do not buy this and save your fingers. Watch the videos people have posted on this boom.
5,All good...
5,Good condition thanks you
5,Love it!!! It's durable and looks nice.
5,Great perfect for my mics
1,The middle tension adjuster broke and the boom arm just swings up passed where it should. Don't waste your money it belongs in the trash
5,Definitely good quality!!
1,The tension on this thing is ridiculous.  It just wants to spring into a straight line no matter what I do.  Had to return it.
5,Nice quality build no spring I love it!
1,it broke withing 5 minutes of opening and that is not an exaggeration. The tightening mechanism is plastic so the Teeth got stripped when tightening down its like using a plastic screwdriver bit on industrial screws. ITS NOT WORTH $100 AT ALL. POS
1,Within 2 minutes it broke in several places.. Followed instructions to the T. The clamp broke with barely any pressure and the middle arm tightening mechanism broke instantly.. This thing is absolute garbage DO NOT BUY IT.. I expected so much more from you Blue.. Trash..
1,The stand is not stable.  It is not possible to adjust well.  When adjusting the screw cracked.  Very bad.
1,The springs that balance the position of the arm are SO INCREDIBLY STRONG that it is a physical impossibility to tighten down the brackets
5,Very well made.
1,Really nice boom arm but very microphone specific. This won’t lock into place the microphone has to balance the tension.
2,Already broken after using it for a couple of months.
1,Won’t stay in a low position no matter how much you tighten it.
5,Works well sturdy
2,Won’t stay where I want it. Not worth the buy
1,To much plastic breaks very easily when you tighten the joints and also has way to much tension
2,The stand broke little after a year.
5,good
1,The middle screen broke and you must have a heavy mic or it will raise the stand because it’s spring loaded or something.
1,Junk! Would not stay in position from the start. Mounted my yeti pro to it and could not get it to stay in any position except straight out. Item broke at the middle joint after 3 uses.
1,NOT FOR BLUE YETI NANO.Even at the lowest tension the blue yeti nano alone doesnt weigh enough to counter balance.
1,Arm won't adjust past 120°. Tried to do a 90° bend am it won't stay...tightened middle only to have it break...completely expensive an useless...This is a don't buy...Unless u just want a straight arm Mic holder.
1,Returned. Received with middle joint faulty. Initial extend caused joint to explode.
5,Durable product
3,It did serve me well for a few years.  I did expect it to last much longer.  It takes SO much force on the knobs to hold things where I need them after a few years a plastic piece is stripped out.  I think I can do a repair with a sturdier piece of hardware and that's what it will likely take... it just won't look good on camera now.  My other option switch on to another brand.Too bad it broke.  I loved how it looked.  It was an elegant piece and it did do the job for a decent amount of time.  My final assessment is that if you can afford another brand you may fair better.
2,The box came super damaged
5,Great product
1,Not happy after just getting this.  The Hinge at the bottom keeps falling forward. I have to try my hardest to overly tighten that knob else it keeps falling forward at that hinge
1,Have had to return this thing to Blue Microphones. Now the replacement has seized up as well. Next time I’ll just go with a Rode PSA1
1,Every time I lift up the microphone the microphone just falls right back down. The arm cannot support the Yeti Microphone at any other position but down. Stay away from this trash boom arm.
3,Bought one 2 years ago. Decent enough Boom if over priced due to the name. Randomly just snapped at the middle hinge so it slammed my mic into the desk not happy about that.
2,Disappointed. Product arrived with the bottom mounting bracket broken
1,Ordered delivered but received no seaclamp.......... only thing this is good for now is a heavy selfie mic
1,Product screw stripped out after hardly any use so dissatisfied with the quality of this after paying top dollar for something that was supposed to be good.
1,As I placed it into the slot the stem snapped  and bent backwards...should have went with the rod mic stand instead....
1,Totally wasted my money. The spring is too strong even with adjustment. Unless you got microphone that weighs heavier than fridge you got no chance of bending the joints.
3,It worked good but the screw and now it is in 4 pieces
1,Absolute garbage for the price.
1,This is piece of crap and I can't get any support from manufacturer. Please do not buy this product. you will regret it.
1,this is so garbage
1,Terrible. Even with recommended Blue Yeti and Radius Shock Mount this aluminum ruler refused to hold ts shape. 0 out of 5 stars.
1,This thing came and it cannot me set properly. It just springs into a straight line it is unusable. Will be returning....
1,Would not hold the Rode Podcaster Mic... kept falling/drooping.
1,came out of the box with one position letterly a stick can do a better job.DON'T BUY IT.
1,Used it with a Shure SM7b heard a pop randomly and the entire unit straightened out and slumped down.
1,Absolute garbage. And a huge huge pain in the ass to setup.
1,Very difficult to tighten cheap plastic knob to tigthen broke.
1,Broke in less than 2 months
1,Spring is garbage. Disappointed. I’m getting a psa-1 instead.
1,To expensive for what it’s used an uncomfortable to use.
1,Not of good value
1,didn't lock
1,I'd give this zero stars if I could. I bought one of these about 3 years ago. It never worked well at supporting my Blue Yeti mike and would slowly sink unless fully tightened to the point of nearly injuring my fingers. Then it collapsed. When I disassembled it I discovered that the weight of the entire mechanism and mike is held up two wires that connect to a single spring. Add to that the metal that connects the wires to the spring is a very soft cheap alloy. In my case one of those connections broke and the entire boom arm collapsed slamming my microphone into the side of my table. Fortunately the mike wasn't damaged when this happened. The connections are an obvious weak point and it would not surprise me if this is a regular end for these boom arms. The hinges themselves are another weak point as they are made of cheap plastic.This is low-quality construction in the extreme hidden under a nice-looking metal exterior. Given the cost of this boom arm the manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves. Most of these types of boom arms from other manufacturers seem to have multiple springs visible on the outside of them and far better quality construction. See photos for a look at what is under the metal exterior of the Blue Compass boom arm and take special note of the photo showing the spring and the broken piece of metal that used to connect the wire to it.Save your money and all the headaches (and possibly the destruction of your microphone) and get something like the Rode PSA 1 or the DISINO arm both are far better made.
1,Genuinely do NOT buy this. Unless you have an anvil for a mic the tension is much too high. It's not made for micro adjustments (the entire reason behind having a boom arm in the first place. The middle join is the touchiest and trash quality design I've seen yet. Buy the Rode RSA1 if you want quality want to spend $100USD and don't have a Thor Hammer mic. Otherwise if you want a budget boom go with the cheap Amazon stuff as my old one from them literally outperforms this overpriced trash from Logitech. What's new.
1,Like lots of other people have said there is literally zero way to get this tensioned to correctly balance your mic. The springs will straighten the arm out regardless of how tight you adjust the arms. I'm aware of the tension screw in the base but no amount of adjusting that makes any difference either. Also the range of motion on the furthest link (the one the mic actually sits on) is abysmal. I never thought I could feel so strongly towards a mic arm but I genuinely despise this thing.If you have a Blue Yeti and were hoping this arm would just work it won't. Seriously go find another brand.
3,The Blue Compass is a very sturdy boom arm and both looks/feels very high quality. My only gripe with it is bending it and keeping it in that position is near impossible. The springs in this thing must be rated for spaceships or something because they just aren't bendable at all. I do love the design of it but I just don't think I can recommend it with it's inability to stay bent.
1,The tension at it's LOWEST point is still too strong to be able to freely move around Blue's own Yeti microphone which I find mindblowing. Renders the arm completely useless so I'm pretty disappointed with this purchase.
1,Not even worth your money Chinese garbage
5,Super sturdy and husband is so happy with quality
1,I have a Blue Yeti mic and I bought this thinking it would be perfect being they are the same microphone and I saw the yeti caster bundle so why wouldn't I think it would work together. I have tried every single tension possible on this thing and I for the love of God can not get it to not shoot up into the ceiling. I have replaced this thing twice because I heard sometimes they are made too tight. and all 3 of them were to be honest. $100 pieces of garbage. when you look it up on the internet. the common and basically only fix is to either exchange and replace them till you get a good one or to LITERALLY TIE A WEIGHT TO THE ARM... what a joke
4,I have a rather deep (and expensive) wood L-shaped desk that the average cheap spring boom arm just couldn't reach across. I finally pulled the trigger on this. At first I tried mounting a floating shelf behind my monitors which sort of worked but the tension in this thing is ridiculous. Yes I loosened the main tension screw at the base as well but either way the tip of the unit just isn't fond of me trying to force it below base level - even though technically it can. Luckily I decided to try making use of the grommet hole the desk shipped with and was surprised that it stretched that far - close to 42 in inches all said and done. I have a relatively light mic compared to the 2.2 lb Yeti as my AT2020 only weighs 12.1 oz. I do wish the companies making these semi premium arms would do the following:-Have some type of depressable button tension that is capable of locking the arm to the base while still allowing movement. This would allow these things to be mounted upside down and hang from a shelf. This would be super useful for those of us that have Hutches for our desks.-Have ball joints at each joint including from the base instead of this old y-axis only stuff.-Make the tension system easier to adjust (and forget). This would actually work better with ball joints.-Longer reach. 40 really ought to be the minimum. Not everyone has a cheap IKEA desk made of fiberboard that there's no harm drilling a more permanent mount into.-Instead of a scissor use a 3 arm (or more) system. Up over the monitor down to voice. That outta be bare minimum. I'd pay an extra $100 for those features.
2,I struggled with this boom arm for several hours when I ultimately decided that this thing will eventually snap if I keep messing with it. the boom arm has two adjustable settings: Straight up and down and 90 degree right angle. That is all folks! The arm adjusts in the way IT wants to and doesn't care if you want it in a different position. There is a tensioner that is so stiff that the arm will snap back and hit you in the face when it doesn't like the position YOU want it to be in. Buy this arm if you are willing to readjust your entire desk and monitor setup around the boom arm not the other way around. Wish I could return this pointless product but it was not bought on Amazon.
5,Works great for me. It has a simple design which I enjoy none of that weird springy mess. Also works great with my HyperX microphone! Personally it is worth it.
4,I tried many of the boom arms and found this to be the absolute best in the price range.  It is sturdy elegantly simple and provides a clean appearance and good adjustability.  The other boom arms are cheap don't clamp securely and wobble creak and transfer noise to the mic.  The included clamp is very nice and securely attaches to the desk.  The arm is strong adjustable and most importantly it is smooth and quiet.  I can move the mic without it picking up any noise.  I am using the mic with the SHURE MV7 with the 3" Shure extension.  I highly recommend this whole setup.  I tried out the Yeti Caster which is a great deal but ultimately returned it because the mic is too sensitive and picks up too much noise.  It also had an internal hiss to the mic.  The SHURE MV7 is top notch and this boom arm is a premium product as well.  Hope this helps someone that is on the fence.  Buy this arm and you won't regret it.  It is worth the additional price.
3,While it’s made of what seem to be quality materials the biggest weakness is the advertised feature of “Hand-tightened friction-hinges.” It did work great when I first got this arm but over time the hinge at the base doesn’t have enough friction to keep a Blue Yeti shock mount and wind screen where you place it when the arm is extended out somewhat vertically. The edge of my desk is about 35” away from where I sit so the arm has to be extended out so the microphone is likely too heavy in this configuration but that shouldn’t be case since this arm is one of the recommended accessories for the microphone.In an attempt to get enough friction to allow the arm to be extended where I need it to be I turned the tension adjustment so much that it no longer allows any adjustment. I pulled the adjustment cap off and found that the construction is that the plastic adjustment is attached to a machine screw with ridges that are intended to provide enough friction to turn the adjustment cap thoroughly. Even if I were to get the adjustment cap back on I know that there is no way I’ll be able to get it tight enough for the arm to sit where I need/want it as the ridges are going to fail again.So I removed the built-in machine screw and replaced it with a standard machine screw and a few metal washers. This allowed me to use a ratchet to get the arm tight enough to stay where I want it to be. It’s really unfortunate that I had to modify the arm to get it to work as intended as I really liked it up until this point. This arm would benefit from small ridges inside the joints so that the hand-tightening is merely used to lock the positioning in place.
3,I loosened the tension screw in the base as far as it would go and I still had to aggressively tighten down the friction plates. Even with that my Yeti mounted at the end wants to pop up. It seems like this arm is great if you want it mounted very far from you or if you want to have the mic above your head but that doesn't really work for a gamer. I will definitely consider replacing it at some point in the future if the friction plates fail (which it seems they must given how I had to tighten them).
4,I purchased this arm awhile back from best buy. It's a very nice arm incredibly durable. I had a problem where my arm would keep rotating and not stay where i wanted it to but after inspecting the desk clamp the little padding on top had been misaligned causing it to not be level. I simply peeled off the padding and centered it myself. The arm spring is also very tight but is adjustable with the screw at the bottom of the ARM (not the clamp).They were problems that initially led me to believe the arm was incredibly cheap but in reality it just has a high level of adjustability.(except the misaligned pad. I havent seen anyone else complain about it though so I assume I'm the only one. I couldn't find a solution online because no one else had the problem.)After fixing these "problems" the arm is perfect incredibly adjustable and very useful.
5,The clamp on the middle joint broke within a month. Other than that this arm was great but is now pretty much useless.Edit: turns out issue was human error and me not reading the instructions. There is no need to overtighten the joint screws if you set screw at base of arm (where it connects to desk clamp). Still wish the joint clamps were not so easy to break but updating review to 5 stars since other than my error the arm is fantastic.
3,I researched multiple boom arms before purchasing this one. Built quality is great (although the plastic knobs feel like they will break any time I tighten them). The look of it is great yet the main purpose of this arm is wasted because of the tension. No matter what I do the mic will not stay where I want it to stay. I have tried many hours to make this work but it just wont. I didn't know I needed a PHD in physics to set up a boom arm....
4,I actually really like this product. I agree with some other reviews about a couple of things though. You do have to twist the tensioners very hard to get it to stay in place. Mine with my Yeti mike wants to lift up too much if not really tightened. I use the shock with it as well. I really like how it easily swings out of the way when I'm not using it. I am a university professor and now use it to record short weekly videos for my students who are online. The sound from the mike much better than the laptop mike I had been using before partly because the mike itself is way better and partly because I can position it perfectly for my online chats and recordings.
5,I was worried about making the investment on this boom after reading a couple of the reviews that mentioned trouble with the joints and spring tension. Well rest assured this works perfectly with a yeti on a shock mount. I didn't have to adjust tension at all and basically just screwed the shock mount on to the arm and positioned it where I wanted it. For the reviews that say it's too loose or too tight - they clearly didn't read the directions or pay attention to the stickers on the arm when they unboxed it. The base has a screw for adjusting the base joint spring tension. The other two joints have a twist tightener that you can tighten down to hold the arm in place.If you're reading the negative reviews and worrying about whether this is a good choice or not - just buy it. It looks great it moves great and it works great.
1,Terrible product that does none of the things you would want out a boom arm is made of sub-par materials and broke during setup. would not recommend to anyone for any application.
1,I was wanting to use this arm for live streaming and content creation but the middle adjuster clamp broke after I was trying to tighten so it would not fall don't buy it get the RODE PSA1
1,This godam boom arm is good and all but for one little thing…THE ARM DOESNT STAY IN PLACE it keeps going up like it’s trying to escape idk why they thought that was a good idea I tightened it with the might of Zeus didn’t work now I have to get a new one
1,It raises by itself which leads to you tightening it with screws and them the middle part breaks!
1,top half straightens out if the bottom half is bent and vice versa so there's really no inbetween as far as being able to set it up at a specific angle. my fingers are bloody and bruised from tightening the hinges so much to try and compensate but it just doesn't work.
5,As you may have seen there are some bad reviews for this boom. Ignore them. The vast majority of these reviews could have been resolved by simply glancing at the manual that came with the boom arm in the first place.I purchased the yeticaster broadcaster kit that came with the boom arm shock mount and blackout yeti microphone.I have some very minor complaints but overall it will hold the very heavy yeti mic a pop filter (bought separately) and the shock mount with 0 issues.When you first un-box the thing you will notice that the spring is very strong. All you have to do is loosen it by turning a screw located in the base of the arm. Boom 90% of bad reviews negated by little more than a 4th grade reading skill.Now my genuine complaint and it was relatively minor was that the screw for the c-clamp to mount the the arm to the desk has a rigid and fixed plastic "T" style handle to crank it down. I have a large old school teacher desk so the T handle just smacks against the side of the desk and I can't tighten the clamp whatsoever. I will be contacting blue about a possible replacement of that particular piece.
5,I had a Rode PSA-1 before this and all I can say is that is amateur compared to this arm.This arm does not wobble actually stays in place and and I never have to retighten the bolt on my Electro-Voice shock mount. I actually mount the shock mount horizontally on this boom arm something that I could NEVER even think about doing on the Rode PSA-1 because I would be certain that the mic would come crashing down and slam into the desk and break because of how the bolt constantly loosened and had so many massive problems.This is so good that I ordered a second one to attach my GoPro to to do top-down unboxing / electronics repair / tech review videos.Highly recommended.
1,I don't know what spring they put in these but I'm surprised one of these things hasn't been in the news for flying up and killing someone.  The spring they used is way too strong and there is no way to tension the thing to actually stay where you want it - it will always just spring straight again.I tried my best to use it saw how impossible it was and threw it in a closet angry at myself for spending money on something that was useless.  After a year or so I decided to give it another try.  I tried to crank the knob in the center of the pole as hard as I could with my fingers (leaving them sore and bruised) and I still couldn't get it to stay in place.  So out of frustration I decided I was going to push this thing until it either stayed in place or broke.  And well it broke very quickly. I wrapped some electrical tape around the center knob to try and protect it got a pipe-wrench and started turning the knob and after a few rotations it broke clean off (see photo).So in the end there was literally no physical way to tighten the knobs on this thing to get it to stay in place.  I feel bad but I just ended up throwing it in trash where it belonged.
4,great but occassionally needs to be retightened if moved a lot....
1,Bruh......Let me begin by saying I deadlift 400 pounds bench 350 and squat 405.  I'm literally sweating trying to get this UNBENDABLE stick into ANY useable position. I have no clue what they tested this HULK ARM on but this is ridiculous. Like seriously this thing is crazy strong for no reason. It's like they put a boulder on the end of it and was like "BOOM BATTLE READY". Only buy this thing if you're  Dwayne The Rock Johnson. He's probably the only man alive who can bend this thing. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY.FIVE stars for the sturdiness no doubt. This mofo so sturdy. The quality is nice but dang.... I CAN'T BEND THE MOFO.Value for the money.. I guess it depends on what you're using it for. You could probably tie hundred together and use them as a battering ram. Or maybe sell them to the police to use as billy clubs. I'm gonna give it one star. Due to the fact that I can't use the mofo. I hate this thing. I wish I'd returned it.This is the only review I've ever written.
1,It all makes sense why you don't see any content creators using this boom arm.I'll start with the one good thing about this boom arm. It has a built in spot to run your cable up the arm that's it. I assume it's $100 because it's sturdy and definitely built out of good materials but everything about this boom arm is a pain in the butt.This boom arm works well enough if you have the boom arm set to higher than your head so that you mic is hanging down towards your face but still refuses to keep the mic low enough to where I want it. But if you try to sit the mic on top of the arm and have it positioned below your face it's just springs up. I've tried turning the tension screw on the base as far as i can go before I think I'll break it which btw is a pain to twist to the right and hurts your hand and yet it still springs back up above my head.Definitely wish I had gone with the Rode PSA 1 boom arm but since I was given this boom arm I can't refund it and get that one instead.  Don't waste your time or money on this boom arm and get the Rode PSA 1 instead.PS in the time it's take me to write this review the mic has gone from my mouth to above my head :/
1,Purchased this boom arm and within 2 years one night the boom arm came crashing down on my desk with my SM7b slamming into the desk. Absolute garbage for a $100+ arm.I now have to find a new boom arm and this one was purchased with my old Amazon account so no idea what the warranty would be. Also adjusting this thing has always been a pain and the knobs to tighten it sucks.
1,This $100 waste of money doesnt stay up. No matter how much adjusting ive done to the tention knob or the plasic locks it just falls down every time. I feel bad to tell the gifter what happened but I would NEVER recommend this peice of junk to anyone. I can almost guarantee the company wont bother reaching out to replace it either. Stay away.
1,Extreme tension even if you use the tension screw at the bottom it's useless and even with that excessive tension the joints break super easily it didn't even last 3 months and during that time the usability was the worst I have experienced you will get a better experience with any $15 boom arm.
1,Didn’t last 5 minutes. . . Have never had any issues with my equipment breaking. It was all user error but let me elaborate.I took the mic stand out of the packaging and the stand was straight the sticker side that says “this direction only” was facing the opposite side of me so I try to bend it like a normal mic stand it had a little give so I though hmm this is probably just tension and im going to have to adjust later once my equipment is on but SNAP!!! It breaks straight out the box. Yes it’s my fault but all my other mic stands and monitor mounts come out the box already bent so I don’t have to guess what way it bends the little sticker on the side obviously didn’t help.Initial thoughts on the product compared to my heil that I also bought from amazon for a cheap price then the blue compass is a lot longer and nicer in quality I purchased the blue compass for the sleek design and was very excited to receive the product since it’s usually sold out though it would be nice with my setup.Unfortunately will not get to use please don’t be a dummy like me and be careful!
1,this arm is really hard to use because it doesn't actually hold the position you need it to. it's great if you don't need to use your camera otherwise it takes up half your screen unless you position the mic on your hands or something. really hard to tighten. save your money and buy one of those cheaper arms. That works 1000% better and takes up way less space.
1,I'm absolutely stunned this has so many good reviews and it makes me think I maybe got a defective one. The bottom hinge that keeps the lowest joint in place where you want it simply had too much slack and could not carry the weight of Blue's own microphone (Yeti X). I tried twisting it with my fingers which were literally bleeding by the time it was done. I tried to put it back up after that and it was still slacking. I tried to make it work but within two minutes the entire bottom hinge snapped and broke into about five pieces dropping the mic on my desk. And now the stand is completely broken.I didn't do anything unusual here and it was with Blue's own mic so there's no excuse in my opinion. Basically the bottom hinge just drifted under the weight of the mic until I tightened it so much it broke into pieces. It never actually carried the mic's weight and now I'm out $100.They make great mics but this stand is absolute garbage.
1,I was excited when I ordered the Blue Telecaster kit which includes this boom arm but the excitement was short lived.  This has been the worst piece of equipment I have ever bought.  I followed the instructions to a T and still the mic never holds and I always have to have it in positions that don't benefit quality because I need to keep it further away and up high from me.  Whenever I move the arm back and forward (to bring it closer to me or move it away from me) I hear a snapping sound.  Just took it apart as far as I could and discovered that the cable inside used for the tension is coming out of it's track and a lot of plastic components inside are chipped severely disfigured and chunks falling out of it.  I'm glad I didn't waste too much money because the Telecaster kit comes with the mic a shock mount and this pile of wasted materials.  Luckily when factored together this arm only cost me roughly $20 which is more than anyone should pay for it let alone the $100 stand alone price.  I'll be finding another boom arm that can actually perform it's task.
1,the middle joint tension which causes the damn thing to snap straight up. don't buy it
1,While the Blue Yeti is a decent Microphone but this Bundle offer of Microphone+Compass Arm is something that has been nothing but an utmost disappointment.There are other boom arms at 1/5th price available that might potentially be better options. Its simply not worth paying $ 100 for the flimsy poor quality arm. Buyers- pl research a bit on similar complaints and take a call.
2,Seriously why is this tension so high? I loosened the tension screw *all the way* and I *still* cannot get the thing into the positions I want. I'm a fairly strong dude and just trying to rotate it into positions against the tension is extremely difficult. Even if you have the strength to move the joints into the place you want them the friction screws to lock it into place aren't strong enough to combat the extreme amount of tension. Why the heck did they make this thing so powerful? It's incredibly frustrating to work with.I just don't get it. Why is it like this?
1,I read review after review watched video after video proclaiming this desk mounted boom stand to be one of the best on the market. SAVE YOUR MONEY. This thing has been a complete pain in my butt since the day I bought it. First of all the BIGGEST problem is it is a HUGE pain to get this thing to sit how you want it unless the bottom section is as close to 90 degrees as possible. I have spent SO MANY HOURS over the last year trying to set the tension properly and once I'm able to get the thing to stay put I better not touch it or it drops right back down. And I'm using one of THEIR MICS (Blue Amber)!Blue you guys need to step up your game and make this right if you want me to EVER purchase or recommend one of your products again cause at this point NEVER gonna happen.
1,When you look at it looking sturdy and slick especially comboed with the blue yeti it seems like an alright deal. Couldn't be far from the truth. The major fault of the product is the retention screws located at the pivot points. You will tighten them to keep your mic in the position you want it and it will not stay in place. It is not your fault. This is a design flaw. Keep tightening it (which will require vice grip pliers) will not keep your mic in place once again at least not to an acceptable degree. Now if you've gotten this far do not continue. Return this if your within the time allotted because it will break. I'll feel I've been even more helpful if you've avoided it all together. This piece of garbage should be discontinued. I believe to each their own but I am.... baffled how anyone has had success/pleased with this blight on good paying customers. Now this could have just been this particular one. Bad batch maybe? Either way it's not worth trying again. Your money and energy will be wasted here. Please I urge you for $100? Spend it else where.
1,In most ways this unit is solid and well-engineered. But here's the thing. It can't be adjusted to handle lightweight microphones. It's all fine if you're using a Yeti or a heavy studio mic like a U-87 or CU-29. But if you're using this boom stand on something lightweight like a MHK-416 (as I am) you will need to use gaff tape to hold it in place. Otherwise it will slowly extend over the course of five or ten minutes till it's at full length. THere is an adjustment screw that supposedly controls this but it does not adjust light enough for lightweight mics.If you DO get one of these or already have one take my advice don't even try to adjust it. Just put gaff tape on it and leave the springs as they are. You'll just end up twisting the plastic adjustment screw head off like I did. If you DON'T have one of these great. Check out the ones from Rode. They're the business I have one at work. Looks like pretty soon here I'll have one at home too after I run out of blue tape.
5,I received the item in good conditions and very quickly.
1,I have this microphone stand with a Rode Procaster (1.6 Lbs). When fully extended the arm falls flat down. The only way to keep the microphone from falling on the desk is to put the arms at an angle which I don't want.Yes. I have tighten the bottom screw. I'm worried about striping the head of the screw if I continue. I've even went to the degree of loosening all the other joints and then tightening the tension screw. I have another arm coming in the mail. I'm so disappointed by my first choice.That said The arm looks wonderful. It's clean looking and the cable routing is very nice.The setup is real pain. I can't tighten these screws tight enough so I have to use pliers to remotely get them tight. It looks real clean but the setup may not be worth it.
5,Really like this
1,I purchased directly from Blue and am using with a Yeti. The arm is not capable of holding up the weight of the Yeti it just flops over. The tension screw is not capable of being tightened enough--and when you try to tighten you can literally break arm. The unit looks great and seemingly has quality materials but it is a terrible product since it does not accomplish what it was designed to do. EDIT: Blue replaced the product it was a simple process to do so. I do not believe my first one was defective it is simply a poor design that is easy to break and you won't know the limits how far to stretch the boom until it is too late. Now that I know the limit it is serviceable but I always seem to have to adjust knobs to get it to stay put.
2,Within 6 months it snapped in half because I had to constantly tighten the arm so that it would stay in place. If it weren't for that this arm would be great. The quality of the arm itself is good just the plastic used to tighten and adjust the arm is weak and overall lead to it breaking.
1,I am extremely disappointed with this mic boom. I have gone thru 4 of these now in the past 2 months. They last about a week and the lower hinge fails to support the weight of the mic and the thing just drops to the table.I am using their Yeti Mic and Their isolation ring.Its not as if I am using some crazy heavy mic on this.Aside from this lower hinge constantly failing this thing is very nice indeed. Over all it looks very pleasing. Sadly this sort of defect ruins the whole thing.I would give this 5 stars if they would perfect the lower hinge to support the weight of their own products but with 4 out of 4 failing inside of a week I cannot give this any more than 1 star. Would give 0 if I could.I would definitely not recommend this until they fix this defect.If you want to take a chance its probably guaranteed to break but there is a fix for it on thingiverse just search thingiverse for the name of his item.
1,Video recorder/streamer without a lot of microphone experience for the record.Messed with tension spring extensively tweaked all the joints nothing. Could barely get it set up and only when the mic was on it did it sit even remotely normal. Even after all that it was super short and very cheap plastic. The joints use a terrible design (these plastic screw cap things) that don't tighten enough to stop it from moving and are really really hard on your hands to use even if you lower the tension of the spring all the way. It also did not want to attach to my desk at all I've gotten much higher quality clamps from cheap desk lamps I've purchased.Just all around a disappointment which sucks because I was really excited to get it.Proof that a name brand does not a good product make.
2,No matter how you fool with the tension screw and the tension knobs the thing is so tight that it the range of possible angles for the arm is extremely narrow. If you don't have quite a bit of room behind the C clamp mount for the elbow of the boom you can't use this arm. Super frustrating.
1,This doesn't work for lighter microphones and no amount of adjustment will prevent the arm from floating out of position
5,This mic boom is the bomb.  Clean and sturdy.  Pairs well with my Blue Yeti mic.  Cleanest mount for any clamp on desk accessory I have ever used.
1,Do not buy this!!I have a Yeti mic and my fiancé brought me this mic stand. The weight of my mic is not heavy enough to keep the mic down no matter how hard I turned the dial to keep it from moving. Whenever I used this arm with the my mic under my mouth this arm was CONSTANTLY moving the mic higher and won’t stay down!After 8 months it’s broken. Absolute TRASH.
1,I need to move the mic around a lot. I especially need to tuck it away for long periods so that it's not between me and my computer screen. I also use my mic at an adjustable desk for videoconferencing throughout the day and need to change angles all the time.The Blue Compass is terrible for this. I cannot get the Compass adjusted properly - it seems to creep (mainly droop) no matter how I have it set. I have tightened the adjustment screw like a gorilla and pinched the heck out of my fingers trying to tighten the external knobs.Now it just sits in my closet gathering dust.
1,I just got this boom arm and was excited to get it installed. However after loosening up the tension screw and tightening all the 3 thumb screws the arm is not able to hold its position and reverted to its original position. the problem is with the middle thumb screw. Wasted 1 hour to research how to fix this but there is no resolution available. Seems like there are different tension in different arms and some people have luck with them... I am not wasting more time on this. Returning for sure.
1,I do not like the boom arm! It doesn't stay in a place where I put it no matter how much I tighten the tension screws. I was trying to get the second bend to stay at a slight bend but it would not stay. I wound up breaking the plastic screw so now it definitely won't stay now. Get the PSA1 from Rhode instead!
1,I received the boom are today with high expectations ready to use on stream. However I cannot even use my 100$ boom arm because i received it missing the clamp necessary to attach it to my desk and it seems that I am the first person in the world to have this problem.
2,I have owned this for about two or three years doesn’t like to hold a single position for a long amount of time... way too expensive and barely does its job
1,I would like to clarify that I bought this from another store. I have had this arm for less than half an hour and have already decided to return it. I read all the reviews watched all the videos but it will NOT stay put. I tightened the screw at the base as hard as I could and I tightened the the hinges as hard as I could. No joke this actually CATAPULTED my microphone (which is fairly hefty). DO NOT BUY THIS BOOM ARM.
1,This was so bad I am returning the entire bundle from Blue and getting another mic. It's sad that they would even put their name on this product. They lost me as a customer because of it. $100 is an absolute joke of a price for this thing. DO NOT BUY!!!
1,This boom arm uses ridiculously strong internal springs in the arm. It is impossible to get this damn thing to stay in one position no matter how much you tighten the adjustment screws. Materials are nice but the arm just sticks straight up off my desk. Good design terrible execution.
1,For a 100 dollars it's a pretty looking paper weight even after adjusting the tension at the base of the arm to the point if I screwed it to the left anymore the screw simply fell out the tension was too much even with the blue yeti and shock mount attached it slowly goes back straight up I really wanted this to work but no matter how hard I tightened the tension screws and how loose I made the tension it just wouldn't stay in place don't even bother with this item to many other options out there
1,Like many other reviews this arm didn't hold the weight of my mic sad that im pairing a BLUE microphone with a BLUE microphone arm... tightened the middle hinge joint as much as possible and the arm just raises upward. ended up over-tightening it and the hinge popped out.. Overall terrible arm
1,I got this as part of the Yetti Caster set and this stand is awful. It doesn't tighten no matter what and ended up breaking because I tightened it too hard. I do not recommend this product DO NOT BUY.
1,Drifts while recording content. Unfortunately I opened the box after 30 days of purchase and Amazon won’t refund me. Oh well... $100 lost for me
1,Way too much tension in the arm and even the screw at the bottom does not adjust it enough. I had to take the top off and disconnect the tension wire to make it kinda work. Not worth it....stay away.
1,Loosened the tension screw to point where it raddled like it was about to fall out. Tried every possible configuration and still couldn't get it to stay put. No matter how tight I could get the  nobs it wants to spring straight. Blue needs to stick to mics because this clearly isn't their strong suit.
2,the top half of the stand will not hold in place! no matter how tight
1,This is such a horrible mic arm. Even after reading the booklet to see that there is a tension screw at the bottom the thing still springs back to the position it wants to be in. I tried to ignore the reviews and give Yeti a chance but I was wrong. Moving on to Rode. This was such a mistake!
1,As everyone else who bought it... can t seem to get the arm to keep any position.  Just goes wherever it wants. Worthless
1,Do not buy this item. Broke first time I pulled it out of the box. The springs are way too strong. Terrible product.
1,Stick with other boom arms it broke in 8 months of very light use. Fit and finish is decent but is let down by poor components.
1,Purchased this item as a "yeticast" bundle that comes with the blue yeti but it was unuseable out of the box. The arm can't support the weight of the yeti so the arm just droops down until it is hanging all the way down no matter how much you tighten the joints.Totally useless. Why sell a bundle if the products don't work together?
1,I currently have it bungee corded...
1,Broke within a month if purchase after many issues with overly powerful springs. Out $100 and very bruised fingers. Buyer beware there are better arms for cheaper.
1,Spring broke after little use. Will not be buying another Blue product after using this boom arm as well as their Mo-Fi headphones which are also shoddy garbage.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I chose this arm because I had good experiences with Blue in the past It had a cleaner look than most arms and it also looked easily transportable (which I needed).  I can confidently say this arm was a terrible choice.  It came out of the box with this weird clicking in the base joint that you can see in the vid.  The tension screw seemed to do nothing in the bottom and the joint tension screws have to be tightened to a ridiculous amount to do anything.  It is also very difficult to find a medium ground that is comfortable for your mic because it will fall down when you need it to raise  and raising up when you need it to lower.Not to big of a problem since it comes with a warrenty.  Problem is that Blue's customer service is really not great.  I am currently in a 40+ email chain to get it replaced that has me going around in circles with what I am pretty sure is auto-responses.  I have to keep repeating things I have said in previous emails and remind them to reply to me over and over.  I am going to try and call next but it's been 2+ months since I have had this thing and it has yet to work properly since day one.  I wish I could get a refund.  GO FOR RODE INSTEAD!!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The entire time I've owned it it's been nothing but a pain in the ass to keep in place. I spent the extra money on this boom because I figured might as well go for a quality arm that will last long sense I stream a lot. It lasted just about a year until the middle joint just broke on its own swinging down on my case. LUCKILY it didn't break the glass or I'd be out another 100$!
5,one of the elbows arrived with small cracks but they are small and not really noticeable and don't affect how the arm works. I am not really bothered by something like this but others might. This arm was sold out/back ordered everywhere i looked. Its a very nice looking arm and works  well.Edit Arm broke from the same area it arrived damaged from. the tension flipped and almost broke my microphone.contacted through amazon and I sent various pictures. I was asked me to return the arm to receive a replacement and I was told that I was sent a usps label and it has been two weeks since that and I have not received anything.I then contacted  the company directly with no reply.Frustrating.Edit: After getting a reply  from the company the arm was replaced without a problem.
1,I bought the boom arm twice and it broke the same way both times. The parts inside are not well made the metal clamps holding the wire have now broke off again. It wasn't even in use and in a resting position. I am not rough with my boom at all and hardly ever touch it. I am just disappointed with the quality for the price. FYI I was using a Blue Yeti mic (like it says it can handle).
5,It has a Nice Aluminum finish too it which symbols a Strong Arm. I got this primarily for usage on my camera for Overhead shots.
5,Not the sturdiness as adjustments require some loosening BUT the wire management is phenomenal. Its so clean and works great.
5,it is very smooth it moves easily you feel this boom interact with you knows where you want it to stay no noise sound while moving unlike metal boom
4,I only have one issue and it's a relatively minor one - but when the rest of the product is perfect even the slightest imperfection stands out.It's too strong for me. Yep. Mics nowadays are getting lighter and lighter and boom arms need to support a wild range - between the ultralight mics and the heavy duty rigs.This boom arm is sleek it's functional it's out-of-the-way when you want it to be and when you want it in your face it does so smoothly and taking up as little space as possible. It's nigh perfect.But for my Shure MV7 plus a shock absorber it's too strong. It will constantly drift around in an attempt to straight up unless I tighten the hinges enough that moving it around is a bit of a chore. It's certainly not *hard* to readjust but I was hoping it would be silky smooth. You can loosen the spring via a hidden tightening screw but I loosened it to the point of the screw itself about to fall off and that was still too strong for me.If you have a heavier mic this boom arm is actually perfect. You will not find even a single complaint no matter how small.
2,after about a year of ownership the boom became unusable  as the middle tightening screw is stripped and not keeping anything tight so my microphone can not be angled where I need it to stay.
1,I'd like to start this review with the good aspects ofnthis boom arm. First of all it is beautiful. I use a Blue a Blue Yeti X for streaming and needed a solid boom arm to hold that monster. This is obviously a Blue product made for such a thing so easy choice. The desk clamp is perfectly functional the tension on the arm is very tight and adjustable (read the instructions) it swings along the base at 360° and has a super nice cable management system that hudes you unsightly cable perfectly.Now here comes my issue with a 99 premium boom arm. The friction adjusters/holders. They are garbage. I move my mic once or twice during a 6 hour game session depending on how I am seated. Sometimes I need to raise or lower the arm meaning I need to spin the friction dial to move it and again to tighten it. I have used this arm for about 10 days and have maybe adjusted the arm a dozen times. The last time I tightened it the entire plastic screw popped off as well as the metal interior screw pushing all the way through the joint. This cause the black plastic piece with the beautiful "Blue" logo on it to also pop off. I have not been able to get the screw back in so now I have a 99 dollar blunt weapon. It is now completely useless. I am NOT an engineer but the entire plastic mechanism seems very weekly designed/made.Now I love Blue and their products. I have used them for years and their mics are awesome and a great value in my opinion. However I treat all of my audio equipment with respect and I never try to muscle nor force anything so I am at a loss for words that such a seemingly well made and expensive product has such an obvious flaw. Very very dissapointed that I paid a hundred bucks to rent a boom arm for less than 2 weeks.
5,works well no complaint.
5,Replaced a cheap $25 Amazon boom arm with this beast because I upgraded my mic to an Electro Voice RE20. Hold the RE20 Nicely you just have to adjust the tension screw on the base and you're good! I don't get the negative reviews this is the nicest boom arm I've ever used.
1,This really is bad design! The cable tension really is too strong and will not hold a typical broadcast mic in place. I can lift a 50# kayak on top of my truck but I am not able to get the friction knobs tight enough to stop the boom from going straight up in the air!
3,So I like the stand it does the job very sturdy I feel like the part that actually connects to the desk could be done a little better basically a 4 inch screw with a punched blank it works and you won't even see it again after you install it so take it as it is.
1,I have the whole set up from blue. A Yeti shock mount and recently got the arm to match. The build is quite nice everywhere except the small tabs which hold your cable in the trench these feel like they will break and are very annoying to open. Otherwise the build is great. I was using this arm to my left and fully extending it essentially and it worked great for about two weeks before the base tilt just snapped? It lost all tension and slowly dropped my mic (better than flinging it across the room I suppose).I almost immediately filed for a return and asked to get a replacement because other than that the arm has been great. Once you get it set up properly and tensioned it's very smooth to operate a shame mine broke so fast. Regardless for this break and the weak cord clips (for $100 I expect more even rubber hooks would have felt more sturdy) I knock a star but I don't think there is much better you can do especially if you want it too look good.Edit: My replacement broke in near identical fashion
5,Felt cheap out of the box but once I installed it blew my mind I totally recommend this product I put it on my isolation booth and it looks and sounds Bitchin
5,Definitely would love for it to be longer as I do plan on upgrading all my monitors to 32” but it fits over my 27” (right one in picture) perfectly. It look really nice for streaming set-ups and improves the look of my gaming set-up. I recommend the blue radius to be purchased with this mount but I feel together they are overpriced. Maybe $99.99 for a bundle would be a more reasonable and fitting price.
4,El plástico en las uniones no es tan resistente pero las demás partes están bien.Si tu micro no pesa lo suficiente el brazo se regresara por mucho que lo ajustes al máximo.Cuidado con forzar o sobrepasar el tope que tienen los brazos o doblaras las uniones que son de un plástico muy endeble.Teniendo en cuenta lo anterior queda muy bien y cómodo para muchas posiciones.
5,Bought the arm for my Blue Yeti mic.  Works great and is a quality arm.  No complaints here.
5,It is just amazing.
4,In short once you get this arm functioning with the right tension in relation to the weight of the microphone it looks very good and feels very sturdy. But my god is it a hassle to set-up.It took me about a hour wrestling with the boom arm. Repeatedly tensing up and releasing tension on the arm via a screw on the bottom. It was extremely confusing how to find the right balance of tension but once I attached the microphone and wrestled with it a bit more it finally worked out.There's a severe lack of instructions on how to tackle this which is super disappointing. I don't want to have a set-up take a hour on something so simple. Be prepared to spend some time setting this up.What's redeeming this for a 4 a star is that once functioning I wouldn't see myself use anything else. The boom arm is extremely sturdy flexible while still holding steady once you stop moving it. It allows for a lot of flexibility for my Shure SM7B that needs to be close to your mouth when your talking; no matter how I'm seated this boom arm matches my location very well while staying in place.If this worked within 10 mins of set-up this would've been an easy 5 stars.
5,Best boom stand fir the money. Sturdy works great. I have four of these booms in our stations studio
5,It fits and holds my Blue Bird with its shock mount perfectly.I can adjust it easily and it holds well so far. Only concern is how long it may endure.I will try to update if anything happens.
5,If you purchase this you will almost forget about it. You pull it closer when you need it push it away when finished. It always gracefully settles itself and I rarely have to worry about it or put too many effort on adjusting it. The real exceptional product makes you forget about it.
5,Heavy duty perfect for my rode microphone
5,Product is super simple to set up and get going. Clears up so much space and just overall looks incredible. Really happy with it.
5,Exactly what we needed. Sturdy yet adjusts easily.
5,I have this boom arm set up with the Blue Yeti microphone and it works great. I really like how it hides the cable. The springs in the arm are a little finicky but I was able to get them set up in a way that works. One of the biggest features for me is being able to rotate my microphone out of my face when I need the extra room on my desk. Whenever I'm not using it I just swing it over and it sits on the side of my desk. It's a great product. Some other reviewers didn't seem to understand that you need to adjust the arms but Blue makes it really easy to do so with the  knobs on the side of each joint.
5,Ya that is pretty much it.  It is sleek functional and works quite well with my Blue Mic.  And my wife contends I have built out a "radio studio" in my office...
5,I am incredibly pleased with how sturdy it feels and the quiet movement is a huge improvement from my previous arm. The cable management and tension screw are very nice features as well.
5,It is sturdy well constructed and IT'S QUIET!! No spring noise or squeaks from adjusting the mic location. The height and reach is perfect! Great investment because there won't be a need for another mic arm unless you need a second one!
4,The boom arm is nice material just like their Yeti mics Blue makes quality parts and they don't feel chintzy at all. That being said you pay for the premium and at $99 I think they could include the Radius III shock mount which they of course advertise with it in all the pictures here on Amazon. But it's sold separate or you can go with a third party on like from AUPHONIX.I have read many many reviews on these Compass boom arms saying the tensions break after a short while so really we'll see how long they last for the $99 price tag but if it's a shot in the dark you want to take you can get the Rode PSA1 instead. That's the only other desk mount arm I would consider and it's the same price so I stuck with same branding as my mic. Side note: The AUPHONIX Pop Filter does fit on the Compass's arm real nice so that's a plus.
5,I actually like this boom arm. It is very strudy and easy to mount onto the desk. I use this for my Elgato Wave 3 and I also love where you can just hide the wires into the boom arm so it doesn't get in the way.
5,I had the issue that alot of people had have with this boom arm the tension was too tight even when loosening the tension screw at the base. Arm would always go back up however a few weeks go by and the issue went away. So either wait it out and if that doesn't work I heard you just need to get another one because you could have a defective product. Other than that it's a beautiful and high quality boom arm!
5,This is a great boom arm. The cable channel easily supports a thick XLR cable or two normal USB cables. Takes a little dialing in but can accommodate a variety of weight loads.I have 3 on desk mounts with semiprofessional mics and pop filters. There is a screw in the to adjust the tension which controls the height. Supports desk clamp or grommet mount. First time setting it up took about an hour second one took me about 15m.
1,I got this for my birthday in January and was really looking forward to using it in my new setup once I got all my parts. I started working on my setup yesterday and started to do the boom arm and one problem Lead to another first I was tightening a microphone when it wasn’t fully straight and got stuck screwing it in it took me literally 4 hours of non stop trying to get it out and looking at YouTube videos while using every tool I had to try and get it out when someone else got lucky and got  it out with a wrench I already tried. Then it wouldn’t stay down I tried tightening all the parts it said to and literally trying every combination to try and make it stay down with the microphone on and it wouldn’t it was working better than before when I tightened it a lot but was still going up over time. Keep in mind this is like 8 hours total of trying to get this to work and now it’s almost midnight I started working on this at 5:20. Then I started to loosen it a bit to see if it would stay down and then the mid point completely snapped and broke apart and I tried to fix it but it wouldn’t stay and kept coming apart and I tried getting the microphone out and it can’t come out now it’s stuck in there and after 9 hours of dealing with a boom arm in 1 day I decided to go to bed and in the morning I tried to reach out to customer service on their website and I still haven’t heard back from them at all since then. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed with the quality and performance of this product considering how much it cost you can get a better boom arm for like 30 bucks that won’t break on you the first 12 hours of using it I still haven’t heard back from customer service but would like a refund to get my money back or a new one to be sent out for it being broke when trying to assemble it.
1,This could’ve been a quality product. It was poorly engineered. The friction hinges cannot resist the spring tension. They should have teeth.  There is a supposed spring tension adjustment but it is useless.  Unless your microphone weighs 25 pounds or more you should find another boom. I have several other brand booms and they all work fine. This is just not properly manufactured or engineered.
5,This is the best stand I’ve ever had
2,I'm using a HyperX Quadcast S microphone and after multiple attempts at adjusting I cant seem to get this to stay in a lower position I'm left to assume that it doesn't weigh enough to place in multiple positionspros-looks nice-sturdy-great for a 90 degree angle or anything over your headcons-wont stay in certain positions (pulls back) and swivels on its own (I added a small piece of rubber on the mount to stop this)
4,It's a decent functional device.
5,I absolutely LOVE this microphone arm. It is attached to my standing desk. It did take me a short time to get used to how it moves but otherwise this has been a great addition to my Yeti microphone.
5,When you get into this type of field audio/video you really get what you pay for. DO NOT "CHEAP OUT" ON MIC STANDS CABLES AND EVEN MICROPHONES. You will regret it if you go the cheap route. You don't have to get the most expensive mic stand either. Just do your research and watch some review videos. That helps a lot. ✌
5,Works great glad I went for this one as the mount is great and compact. I didn't have any issues with the arm tention and following the instructions to set the correct tention on the screw at the bottom of the mount was easy and straight forward. Holds my Yeti and Radius III mount great. Cable management works great for a standard USB cable but if you have a thicker cable it might bulge a bit but should work fine I think.
5,I originally bought this for occasional recording sessions. I never planned on using it more than a few times a month--then coronavirus hit and suddenly I'm using it every single day. I love how I can just push my blue yeti mic out if the way when I'm not using it then swing it into place in seconds when I need it. I have the yeti mounted on an off-brand shock mount and occasionally use a pop filter as well and I have no issues with tension. I do agree with some reviews that say this arm is really powerful--almost too powerful at times--but it's just a matter of managing tension in each of the arm's joints as its design intended. The yeti mic is heavy so you will probably have to tighten it farther than you think you need to but once you get the settings the way you like them you should be able to extend the arm almost completely straight with the heavy mic and accessories dangling off the end of it. Its seemingly overpowered design is what makes this possible. Good stuff. It looks so clean and professional on my desk and I'm not afraid of getting pinched. I highly recommend this arm especially in coronatimes where you might find yourself video chatting more than usual.
5,We love the Blue Compass boom arm to us it's the best value out there and it just looks classy and inviting for conversation!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This Boom Arm is so worth the extra money. I have had 0 issues so far and have had it for about 3 months now. Its super sturdy looks super professional and works great. Do yourself a favor and get this bad boy.
4,The mic stand is good quality and I would have given It 5 stars but the clamp did not fit my desk. The clamp does not open far enough if your desk has an edge on the underside that is over about an inch and a half.
5,My son really likes this for his computering. Could be a tab more sturdy.
5,Works great very sturdy you might have to watch a video or two to get the tension just right for your mic.
4,The construction of this boom arm is nice similar in style to the Yellowtec Mika. It is designed to support the Blue microphone which is large and heavy and the tension of the arm is set accordingly. But if you mount a lighter microphone (which is most other microphones!) the arm will tend to rise. A tension screw in the base can adjust tension slightly but it can't be set low enough for a sturdy lighter microphone like a Shure SM58.I've found the best solution is to add some weight to the microphone by attaching a ball head for a camera tripod (I used the Neewer Panoramic Ball head). The 3/8" base will fit the smaller screw on the Blue Compass. You'll need a 1/4" to 5/8" adapter to attach the microphone to the ball head. This along with some adjustments to the tension screw in the base of the boom should keep the microphone position stable.This is an attractive mic arm. The main sections are black-painted aluminum attached by plastic joints which can be individually adjusted to be stiffer or looser (they're not meant to lock the arm in place and won't compensate for an overly light microphone). The swivel base is compact and works well. Unlike the Yellowtec it resembles there's no internal cable. You insert your own standard cable which fits neatly in a channel along the top with clips to hold it in place. This keeps the cable hidden except for a loop at the elbow of the boom.The main competition for this boom arm is the Rode PSA1 which is also sprung for a heavy microphone. On the Rode the cable is entirely external and is fastened with Velcro straps. The Compass arrangement is much neater. One Rode feature that the Compass lacks is the ability to rotate the mic freely. The top segment of the Compass doesn't rotate at all – if you turn the mic you'll start to unscrew it. Again though if you add a tripod ball head you can make adjustments more easily. Moreover the head of the Compass can be flipped upwards so you could use it as a mount for a small- to medium-weight camera.
4,Es un brazo para micrófono muy bueno y de calidad. Tiene una canaleta para la organización de los cables así queda todo más ordenado. La estética me parece mejor que la del típico Røde l similares.La pinza abre muchísimo en mi mesa de 6cm de espesor no ha habido ningún problema.Aguante perfectamente micro de condensador con araña y antipop si quieres. Solo hay que ponerlo en una posición lógica en la que la estructura tenga un poco de fuerza.El único aspecto negativo son las piezas de apriete para las dos partes que forman el brazo en sí. Son de plástico y seguramente haya que tener un poco de cuidado para que no haya problemas.
4,Great pro mic arm for the money. However the spring tension is rather high so if you don’t have a heavy mic it won’t stay bent.My solution was to take it apart and add a link between the spring and the swaged cable in the lower arm section to relieve some of the tension. It’s easy to take apart just make note that the tension bolts have a circlip on the ends so gently pry the caps off to reveal them and remove the lower tension adjuster screw. After that I cut the heatshrink just enough to pull it back. Put it all back together and now it’s perfect. Would be even better if they offered a couple of different tension springs to you could really adjust it to your liking.
1,I was 99.9% through the whole “get new stuff and set it up process” and the cheap bottom part of the arm broke . Then when I tried to place the arm with the mic on the ground for safety  the arm straightened due to the sling shot mechanism of this device and my mic kinda hit the wall . This is a 130$ mic . I’m hoping I can speak to amazon about this . Very unhappy I have to return the arm and the shock mount now . Great ! This was suposto be fun.
5,I bought a used unit to save a bit and I was scared of other reviews that said that the arm wouldn't stay in position. I tried to flex the arm without the mic attached and it indeed wouldn't stay in position. However after unscrewing all the joints and screwing them back in. I attached the Mic with the mount clamped to the table and it finally stayed in position. A little scare but all was worth it!
4,The things I love about this mic boom arm:  can mount the clamp between my wall and the end of my desk with almost no gap due to the design of the clamp and base.  Still able to rotate the arm without bumping the wall.  Gorgeous - satin finish cable management hidden springs.  Totally silent.By tightening the screw at the bottom (see instructions) I was able to adjust the tension so that my Samson C01U mic and shockmount were at "neutral" that is the mount neither sagged nor rose on its own.  That was the desired state but after an hour or two there was a click and the whole arm sagged to horizontal.  Nothing I could do after that would get the arm to hold an upright position from the bottom joint.  Sad to have to return this beauty.One other thing - I had to buy an extender tube because my pop filter didn't fit around the chunky boom frame. This was fine with me but something you may want to keep in mind. https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0006NMSWO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
1,I have been struggling for over an hour trying to get this to stay in place but it just slowly goes back to it's natural position. I cannot even get it to be in the same position in the photos. The thumb screws are useless no matter how tight I make them. I may not be the strongest person but surely it should work if  you tightening it you the point that you have white knuckles and feel shooting pains in your fingers  afterwards. The internal springs are too tight.
4,So here it goes!I purchased this mic stand after doing a lot of research. From YouTube to online to asking other friends who have purchased it.The common response I got was it's a hit or miss purchase.For example the stand is very hard to keep in place even with the tighten screws. My blue yeti mic sometimes Waze the mic stand down.Sometimes the mic boom arm seems to work great. I know it's a lot to do with adjusting and readjusting the screws/ knobs on the stand. Overall when it is working and functional I love the product.Search YouTube before buying this.
5,This is an amazing product! Well designed performs extremely well and looks awesome. Cable management is neat. The spring has adjustable tension for microphones of different weights (I had to release mine all the way down for NT5 mic). Even packaging is well thought through. It had been awhile since I had a product that I was 100% satisfied with (I even thought they dont make them anymore) and this is one of those rare jewels. Love it!
2,I was very excited to get this great-looking boom arm to go with my Blue Yeti. You'd think it would just work out-of-the-box with the Yeti but what wasn't my experience.  The manual tells you that you will screw in your mic (I do not have the shock mount -- it's not necessary to use this) and to "Adjust Compass so that it makes a 90-degree angle at the middle pivot point".  This proved to be impossible the spring of the arm is just too strong and it always went upwards. There is an important screw underneath the to adjust the tension of the arm and many people online do not know that this setting exists but I read the manual and labels. My screw was totally unscrewed already when it came and I could do nothing with it to loosen the tension.  Maybe mine was broken but I do not trust this design and I've returned it.
5,This is much better than my previous arm!  Quiet stable and thick. I’ve read many reviews before buying this one no complaints except the price. But if I knew it’s fits perfectly to my sm7b(which is a heavy mic) I would  have bought at the first place.
5,I have my Blue Yeti X on the SUNMON shock mount here: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B085ZT69PQIt works great.  Every joint can have its tension adjusted and I would guess that the problems that people describe with it is because they didn't fiddle with it enough.  You should be careful with the setup until you get everything adjusted because the arm will naturally snap to straight.The joint right where the shock mount is installed doesn't seem to have enough tension to allow much deviation from vertical but it's enough for my setup.  The shock mount also can't be made to swivel side-to-side on that joint because that will just screw/unscrew it.  However you can tighten it so that part stays fixed in one position if you don't need to change it often.  The other two joints move very nicely and stay firmly in place.
4,La construcción estética movilidad y funcionalidad general de este brazo es sin duda un 10/10 sin embargo toma en consideración lo siguiente si vas a montar un QuadCast o micrófono de peso similar.De fábrica los soportes internos del brazo están ajustados para sostener micrófonos pesados por lo que tendrás que ajustar esto hasta el mínimo con el tornillo ubicado en la base del brazo (gira un poco antes de que el tornillo se sienta flojo) y aun asi cada que necesites poner en una nueva posición el microfono tendras que apretar las otras perillas repartidas en el brazo para que este quede fijo y el poco peso del mic no lo haga regresar a su posición original.Por supuesto lo recomiendo a pesar de esos detalles ya que es una inversión que te va a durar prácticamente de por vida en comparación de los brazos más económicos la diferencia entre esos modelos y el compass es como la noche y el dia.
4,It used to be the Rode PSA-1 was the best boom arm around. But now this is it. I got it for 139$ and that's about how much it's worth... If you see it for more it's a scam. It's nice not to see the springs. On the bad sides the joint tightness handles seem a bit flimsy and there isn't one for the base swivel. The cable management is nice but it feels like the little clasps would break after a bunch of uses. It's very stable once setup and can hold the Yeti and the AT-2020. Comes with a handy 3/8 to 5/8" adapter.
1,Overall product quality appears good. Unfortunately it arrived unusable right out of the box. The adjustable arm will not hold it's position because the tension in the arm is so tight that the "lock" is not strong enough to hold it in position. So disappointing. Unfortunately I can not recommend this product and suggest buying another similar product.
5,Excelente un consejo para los que lo instalen por primera vez aflojen el tornillo debajo de la base (yo le di como 30 vueltas para un mic blue y su amortiguador) y pongan el micrófono el sistema se balancea con el peso si no se lo pones se eleva solo una vez calibrado es una maravilla el micrófono lo pones donde quieras y queda fijo sin esfuerzo
4,You're buying the official Yeti Microphone arm so the fit is solid. Installation was simple you attach the base to your desk and drop the arm into the base...nice little channel for cables.WARNING: The screw used to fasten the clamp to your desk is very soft. On my 1st attempt to adjust the desk clamp I stripped the retainer clip from fastening screw. Upon closer inspection the retainer clip bent the end off the screw (It's very very thin...maybe less than .02 inches of material there) Once this piece breaks off you'll never get the retainer clip back on. Luckily it's not really needed once the clamp is in place but for the price you're paying it's a bit of a bummer.Also: The package only contains the desk clamp mount...if you want to drill a mount into your desk you'll have to buy that separately from Blue.
5,It took a while to set it up because of the particularities of my table. I set up the stand but the arm kept moving horizontally. I could not get the mike to stay were i wanted. Then I realized why. The base was installed on the far side of the table on an extension wing. But because of the weight of a shelf of books on my table the extension had bent a bit under the weight. Just a tiny angle but enough for the Blue Compass mike to notice. So I had to level the base with folded thick paper and now the boom arm stays exactly where I want it. So lesson learned. Make sure wherever you place the base of the Blue Compass is level!
3,- I got this stand with the Blue Ember (and maybe this stand was meant for the Blue yeti) so the arm kept floating upwards if I had the arm come across my desk instead of over my monitor. If I dangle it over the monitor it could stay in place ok but i still had to REALLY tighten it.- Also the tightening knobs were plastic and small to grasp I felt like I was going to break them but it just wouldn't tighten properly.- Everything else was good though and it looked greatI ended up returning it cause it was causing way too much fussing for just a mic stand
3,As others have mentioned the boom has a very high tension setting that only adjusts minimally with the tension screw.  Tension is also constant through the boom not separated and independant at the hinges;  so when one adjust the angle of one hinge tension is transferred to another.  The hand-tightened hinge will also not lock off the boom  regardless how much one twists; inevitably lighter mics (I’m using the Shure MV7) will rise or you’ll have to adjust strange boom angles. .  It’s essentially pre weighted for the Blue and does not play well with other mics.  Sure just find some weight to balance out light mics (search Amazon for “counterweights” with  5/8” threads).  Yes it is sturdy well built and attractive with good cable management (Though thicker xlr cable could be a problem).  But at this “pro” price point there are options for true “floating” booms just as pretty that professionals would expect.
5,Great arm for supporting the weight of the Blue Yeti microphone. Keeps it off the desk and out of the way while the ingenious design of the arm makes it easy to reposition your mic when you need to. The ability to adjust the balance to make those adjustments is really cool. A little finicky to set up but you can find good videos online to assist with the set up. Did I mention it looks really cool as well? Because it does.
4,Lo usaba con mi micrófono Blue Yeti y no puedo pedir más aunque en un tirón que dio al momento de ajustarlo se rompió de una esquina así que eso de muy buena calidad pues no tanto pero buen creo que es muy caro para lo que ofrece es bueno para micrófonos pesados pero ten cuidado al manipularlo.
5,Upgraded from one of the cheaper Newer arms because it wasn't holding great and creaked so loud when adjusting.Aesthetics alone is enough of a reason to purchase this mount.I use it with the Rode Podmic which is decently heavy and it holds this mic perfectly. It so easily can be swung out of the way when you aren't using it and when you adjust it to where you like it - it stays.Only have had it for a week but highly recommend.
2,Well built and great quality material.... however I think the price point is way high for what it’s user friendliness.  I would suggest you are better off going with a generic boom arm with compatible Blue Yeti connection.The biggest frustration is that the arm has an inconsistent stiffness and rigidity in the springs at either joint.  It is difficult to tweak and calibrate the spring tension to work easily and efficiently.  One join remains stiff while the other is too relaxed - I don’t know maybe I’m missing something and it’s just me?It’s like they spend all their time designing the look but completely omitted user friendly operation and logistics.If it had cost $50-70 I might have a different opinion - but this arm cost the same as the microphone did!! WTF?
1,Sleek looking boom arm swivel is great but completely useless unless you plan on using it to launch your mic to the moon. The spring in this thing is cranked to tight that I basically need to tie two bricks to the end of the boom arm to hold it down.I've watched videos on loosening the spring by unscrewing the screw beneath which brought me down to only needing one brick now.The arm has three pivot points you can tighten to make the hold more secure which basically do nothing if use more than two. The bottom one seems to cancel the middle pivot and thus making it useless but the one nearest the mic actually works.
1,Bought this to support my Blue Yeti Mic. even after watching all the tutorials online showing how to tighten the tension and adjusting the bolt on bottom and the small plastic screw on the joint it would still spring BACK UPWARDS. I tried every possible tension setting with no luck. Returned and bought Rode PSA1 which worked flawless and perfect out of the box and have been using for a month ever since.
1,The good:- looks great with sleek cable managementThe bad:- the joint in mine failed on me and the metal cable moving the arm sheared off the plastic in the joint. When I opened the arm up to see if I could fix this I noticed that the interior of the joint is plastic including the piece that guides the cable in the joint. Mind that I had added no extra tension. This was the default set up and the plastic failed to hold against the metal cable. This arm is set up to fail.Buy the Rode PSA1 instead. Avoid this arm unless cable management is absolutely vital to your set up. I thought that Blue would have done well considering how well built the Blue Yeti microphone is.  This is a disappointment.
2,I keep seeing that it's good for "heavy" microphones so I got a samson g-track pro to put on it and it kept drooping so I kept tightening it then the tightening point on the base of the stand and it just broke off.
5,I had gotten a cheap $30 boom arm for my desk and it sucked insta-return.. Finally decided to spend the 'big bucks' to get this thing.. Really great build quality happy I got it but the price is stupid. Costs as much as the Yeti mic makes no sense.
5,Incredible for my blue yeti! Had the cheap one that said I could use it with my mic and couldn't hold it with shock mount(good for the smaller standard mic). But this stand! Wow! Holds my headset my blue yeti plus shock mount 360 swivel cable manager on arm and can attach on tables that are larger with the clip! Nothing bad to say! Premium build!
2,The boom doesn't stay where you put it no matter how tight you screw the joints.  It will stay close to 90 degrees but no lower the springs just push it back up.  Definitely not worth 150$ maybe 60-80.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Au moment du déballage je me rends compte que la ‘’visse’’ au milieu du bras fait un drôle de bruit je le bouge de tous les côtés et semble déjà brisé. Par la suite j’installe le bras incapable de faire tenir un angle précis. De plus  la ‘’visse’’ du bas est très très rédige difficile à tourner malgré que la visse soit au plus lousse.
5,This is a very expensive boom arm. I bought a cheap one a couple months ago it worked for about a month but the weight of the blue yeti was just too much for it and it broke I decided to pay the extra money for this and I don't regret it. Yes it's expensive but at least my mic is safe and everything stays where I want it to stay.
5,Muy recomendable es resistente no como otras marcas que tienden a doblarse esté en cambio se mantiene firme y cumple su función.
1,This boom arm has attractive styling and is reasonably easy to setup and use.  I originally set it up on my desk for use in my home office where it was moved very little and worked fine.Last week I dismantled the arm and packed it (carefully) for transport by car to another location where I was recording a video by a student.  First the round disk that is part of the clamp attaching to the desk cracked right off.  Then while moving the mic into position the large joint in the arm suddenly gave way and separated.  It was clear the thing could collapse at any moment and it wound up in the garbage.  Nearly $200 bucks down the drain.
5,Very happy with the boom arm from Blue. The compass is far better than those creeky external spring loaded cheapies. It's not cheap but it is made of quality materials.The stiffness of the joints is really nice I can place it in about any position I want. I love the clean look with the cable routing management. Attaches to the desk in a clean way too.Very happy saving up now for a better mic to go with it. Want to upgrade from the Blue snowball to the Yetti.
4,I really love the appearance and build quality.  It works well enough with a heavy mix like the Blue Yeti mic.  The  tension adjustment isn’t great though.  There are spots where it just won’t stay and it will creep upwards a little.
1,Materials feel and look premium but it's completely awful. It kept sagging up. I tried setting everything as mentioned on their tutorials. My arm just ended up falling apart and is now unusable. It's not even been a day. This is trash. Avoid it and get something better.
1,It literally would not stay still every time I tried tightening it (yes I know there is a screw on the bottom that allows you to balance it). It would not stay where I wanted it to probably the worst boomarm I have ever used. RODE will always be a better option than this piece of garbage.
4,Took me some time to figure out how to release / adjust the tightness of the arm (joints). After that it is quite a good experience so far. I am a broadcaster and this Blue arm at home may not 100% replicate my experience in radio stations but it is definitely not average. I would give it an 85% mark for now.Would I recommend it to someone? Yes.
4,My Grandson says: ‘I can’t bring it in front of my face without it rising up. It is a bit annoying. Very easy to clamp put it to the side and manage the wires. It is very sturdy.’
1,The adjustment in the elbow is done using a plastic cap that turns an internal metal screw (so plastic turning a peice of metal - what could possibly go wrong?). The plastic thread in the cap stripped after minimal use in a home office.The rest of the product is constructed to a much higher quality so its a shame this one critical component was not of the same standard.
5,The stand is fantastic!  If people would open a book and read the instructions they'd figure out there is a tension screw in the bottom of the arm that you need to loosen or tighten.  I actually had to loosen the tension to get my yeti to stay in proper place now its completely fine.  Learn to read or don't write hateful reviews people.  COMPLETE human error the stand is awesome! Buy 2!
4,Sturdy and well designed. It has a lot of flexibility in regards to positioning. I wish they made each arm a tad longer. It's a bit pricey as well.Using it with the blue yeti mic on the blue yeti shock mount.
1,This only works if you intend to never touch the mic. The desk clamp shaped such that it will only work with a desk doesn't have a support bar near the edge (most desks); it needs a flat table top with at least a 3" edge underneath.Avoid!
5,Best boom arm i ever used. Very sturdy and does the job. I do streams and use it for online gaming with my friends and had no problems. I bought a Neewer boom arm which was way cheaper and it broke within a month. You get what you pay for!
4,After wanting to move my Blue Yeti Nano off of my desk I decided to go with this microphone arm since it seemed like a nicely designed one. Although it can be difficult to manoeuvre once you get it in the right position and tighten everything up it works just fine. Being able to run the cable down the inside channel also helps give it a more minimalist look.
4,Very Expensive but built very well zero noise takes almost no desk space and is very large and well built. The clips on the wire channel are the only things that are not high quality metal.
5,El brazo se siente muy sólido y de buena manufactura casi nada de esfuerzo para acomodarlo ya que ajustas bien los tornillos que hacen esa funcion
5,proporciona una sujeción muy firme lo compre para un yeti realmente quedo muy bien el acabado es muy bueno y la guía de cables ayuda a una instalación muy limpia
5,After fighting with a few cheaper boom arms I decided to just buy a good one. It does exactly what it's supposed to do and does it perfect. Please don't waste your money on the cheap alternatives you'll be disappointed. If your using the Blue Yeti mike you need this one.
3,I had it for less than a year and the middle dial broke due to tightening the resistance to stop the arm from continuing moving up.  the mechanism is not that strong matching the overall quality of the arm. it simply broke while tightening the middle dial .
5,Bought this for the blue yeti and it works great. My yeti though has died so I’m now using the hyperx quadcast S which also works great with the boom arm.I like the tabs that hold the cables into a channel very neat.Would definitely recommend
4,$100 would be the sweet spot for this stand. PSA1 is more functional and far better bang for buck but the Blue looks nicer and probably holds up heavier mics.
5,Je me sers de cet article pour mon studio. C’est de top qualité ...j’adore. La plupart des mauvais reviews que j’ai vu parlaient de l’incapacité à ajuster la tension du bras ce qui est faux si vous n'oubliez pas bien sur de desserrer la petite vice à sa base ...
4,Great mic stand that spins and bends quite easily. Only complaint is I paired this with the Rode Procaster and it sags when fully extended
5,Very well built solid mic stand. Moves effortlessly and stays where it needs to be. Make sure that your mic is heavy enough as it will retract upright if it is too light. Works great with a Yeti X!
4,Works with the Yeti as designed. Cable compartment however is not designed for multiple XLR cables whilest the Yeti is a stereo microphone so the stand forces you to improvise or use mono only. Tension is also quite tight if used in a folded orientation making fine adjustment difficult. Extended orientations don't have this minor issue.
4,I have very high ceilings and old fashions wiring so this lamp was just what I was looking for.
5,Great boom arm! I tried a lesser brand that did not hold up but this one works very well with a basket that you must purchase seperatley. Very happy with it wish I got it ages ago.
5,I had a Roode microphone arm before this one it was the a nightmare with 10 days of use the rode arm started squeaking like crazy  so I returned and got the yeti one and oohhh boy what a difference and quality and design  you won't regret buying this arm ever I guarantee!
4,I add a microphone arm extensions to my Blue Arms to get a longer reach and its perfect!
1,DON'T buy this the arm will not stay in place if I can give less than 1 star I would imo ... the material (plastic) quality is fine but the product design is (*#&@)
5,I had purchased a handful of boom arms in the past and none were strong enough to hold the weight of a blue yeti mic mounted in a shock mount. This arm however is incredibly sturdy and supports the weight of my mic set up with ease.Rock Solid!
5,Okok wish it was a little more compactable lol just made that word but yah so it can go in small place but other than that isss littt
4,I really love this boom arm. The cable management is great and keeps it very clean. The one challenge is I wish Blue would provide better instructions on how to loosen the tension of the arm for different microphones.
5,This boom arm is a piece of art! Looks great on my desk
3,I bought this arm thinking it would be top of the line. Well i was wrong the arm is way to stiff and even when you slack the nut under the arm. As i tighten the knobs on the side it stayed in my hands and parts went flying all over.Arm looks sick and wish it would have worked but and the end of the day im sad i have to go elsewhere.
4,Hard to prevent it from lifting.  You have t o be oh so gentleIt is sometimes hard to adjust as it wants to swing up despite the weight of the mic
2,It's a well constructed unit but the tension in the movable joints seems to be too much for the retaining dial.Perhaps this is an isolated incident? The product would have otherwise received a 5 star.
5,High quality and nice product overall.  Strong hold and easy to adjust.
5,Easy to setup clean look and well balanced. just works!
5,More expensive but offers a huge quality increase and experience
5,Easy to install very well made components. I really like this mic stand.
5,Great product. My mic was a little heavier then the recommended and it's still holding it up fine.
4,Great stand handles my heavy Mic with no problems! Deducting a star because the permanent mounting hardware is sold separately.
5,I love it must have
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               J’adore ce produit!  Très simple d’utilisation et discret!  Robuste solide et très chic!  Livraison rapide!  Je recommande!
2,It’s lopsided due to the way the joints are designed
5,quiet smooth and almost infinitely adjustable
5,Definitely worth the purchase. I purchased numerous other mic stands but this has to be the sturdiest one. Others would occasionally not hold weight well but the blue compass is sturdy af.
4,Very well built and sure it would be great for a Yeti. Did not work for my Audio Technica as the mic was too light for the springs.
5,I’m soo happy with this thing. Works exactly the way it’s expected to. It’s easy on the eyes and functions great!
5,Good
5,Très bien
5,At first I could not let it stay in position but when I release it and  tighten it then it work
1,dont buy if u have the hyperx or any other mic i did every thing and it goes back up i dont get it just do not buy i ordered 2 and they both do not work
5,Out of the box the tension on the arm makes it really hard to bend so you might need to back off the tension screw a couple turns like I did until it was good.
5,I am still amazed at how much real estate this product has provided me since installation. I would never go back to a crappy boom again.
5,I previously owned a cheap newer arm and im telling you upgrading to this arm is a must!You can freely moove the mic anywhere you want and it is gorgeous! ^_^
5,Very impressed with the quality.
1,This is just ridiculous. Nowhere near as versatile as rode. super stiff and if you're not careful with the tightening you'll hurt yourself. Almost really hurt me even while being cautious.
5,Excellent rapport qualité. Bien conçu léger  précis et silencieux. Et quel look. J’adore cet achat.
5,You won't find a better mic boom arm at this price. Very good quality.
5,Beautiful boom arm that can hold a heavy mic
1,the grooves for the blue yeti dont fit the boom arm metal socket! this is the 3rd boom arm i bought and none fit the socket! its too losse!
1,It won’t balance at 90 degree because spring is too strong even with tension adjustment screw turned down to lowest
5,lucen de gran estética y son de muy buena calidad para las cabinas de radio que se utilizaron.
1,micro remonte toute seul meme si je l ajuste impossible de faire un angle de 90 degreje deteste se boom arm
5,It works!
4,Fantastic boom arm.
5,Amazing articulation and control don't be afraid to loosen the spring tension screw at the base for easier movement.
5,Good built solid exactly what I was looking for.
5,Very nice boom arm good quality easy to work with but maybe a bit expensive $$$. ;)
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Great value.
1,This thing is awful. A huge waste of money. I have a at2020 and it doesnt help it.
5,The arm is built to support the weight of the Yeti Blue mic. Fully positionable and stable.
5,Great productWorth the priceEasy to Use and Set Up
5,its a bit hard to set up but once its done its great. it will stay in place.
1,Does not come with extra screws or anything to help secure its own product YETI NANO with it.
5,Perfect
5,Thanks
1,The arm did adjust as it should have been and it finally broke. I don't recommend purchasing. What is worst I can't return the product in spite of the fact that I have owned the product only for two months. This is not a Premium product at all.
5,Awesome product. Holds my yeti great! Sleek and clean design really adds to it. Good for a great mic arm
1,Rien d'autre a dire a part que j'ai reçu le tout cassé dans la boite
3,I bought this as a gift for my daughter. It didn’t come with a clip to attach it to her desk. Don’t know how she is supposed to use it.
5,Anchored well onto computer desk very stable with large mike attached
5,J'utilise le blue yeti et ça fonctionne A1 avec l'ensemble. Je recommande
5,It’s a very good mic stand but a bit overpriced
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This item came broken how do I get my money back
4,Je l'ai installé à l'envers au début mais il est parfait supporte le poid de mon micro et reste fixe
5,Good
5,The quality is high grade!
5,great product can be adjusted at 3 angles has an area to tuck xlr cord  fastens to desk/table  adjustable
5,Easy to work with
5,stays where you set it.
5,Absolutely solid
1,The item arrived broken .part of it fell out .
4,Works perfectly the tension points are a bit hard to turn.
5,Excellent boom arm  !!
5,solid
5,product was as promised works great on my mic
5,It’s great
2,Positives - clean simple and robust looking.  Will look good when streaming with a smaller desk and set-up.Negatives - not good value for money.  Not practical for those with larger desks and/or multiple larger screens.There has been a trade off in this product between functionality and looks.  There are no cables springs or double arms present and a neat cable tidy.  However the base and the boom arm are connected by a metal tube which allows for free movement and is not lockable.  In certain positions i assume where the centre of gravity is not even due to the position of the arms the arm moves.  I used this to attach the Blue Yeti a big big of kit along with the shock mount.  This meant tightening the plastic screws on each joint with a lot of force to the point it hurt my fingers.. and it would still move with just a little jolt.I have a very wide and deep desk with 3 large monitor meaning the only place to clamp the base is on the front.  The arms therefore obstructed my view of the side monitor.  Finally the microphone screw attachment is a simple design that only allows for rotation of the mike by loosening the screw and taking up the slack with a washer... again not what i would expect from a premium product.For the price i would have expected a heavy stand or a base that can be screwed into the table or a bit more reach.  I would also expect a more functional method of tightening the arms.
4,Decent mic arm with great looks but has a disappointing range of movement.Be absolutely certain that this will fit your desk or setup in the way you need it to as it is not forgiving - especially as an impulse buy. I was fortunate.Pros: Looks great. Stylish with smart cable management and an easy way to adjust the tension in each arm - simply turn the tighteners and if you need to adjust the tension in the base. Simple right?Cons:  Stiff and awkward to manoeuvre can really only be used in a top-down position. If you have a wide desk the arm isn't long enough to keep a good height. Look at the marketing picture! It shows a guy looking at his monitor but the mic is blocking!You can flip the mic up but not all the way (more like an angle) creating some awkward re-positioning similar to adjusting a monitor arm.Be aware: Many are reporting that their mic isn't heavy enough or is too heavy for this boom. Sometimes the increase in tension is not enough or there is too much for lighter mics.Should ideally be used with Blue Mics - or find weight equivalent. To note is that not until I installed the stabiliser did this arm work correctly for me.Conclusion: Finicky item that is made up for in the looks department but do your research and check if it's right for you!Lastly: I have the Rode PSA1 and while it looks bad and has a loose connection at the base - it is by far more functional and it just works.
5,Ce bras de micro est formidable je l'utilise pour un SM7B qui est très lourd et il fait le travail.Il n'y a pas a réfléchir si vous souhaitez acheter un bras de micro.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Did I get the refurbish from the other reviewer here? Had exactly the same issue as him: impossible to hold the position even after trying to get tight utill my fingers hurt it move slowly back in original position.
4,Un peu cher mais matériel de qualité.Si vous avez un SM7B sachez que l'orientation est limitée par la fixation du micro et un connecteur XLR trop long.
4,J'ai pas mal ragé sur le prix de ce produit mais comme j'avais besoin d'un bras de qualité j'ai fini par l'acheter. Et finalement je pense qu'il vaut bien son prix car ça n'a absolument rien à voir avec le bras à 12€ que j'avais avant. Il existe cependant des modèles d'apparence similaire sur les sites spécialisés mais ils font tous plus de... 300€.Bref l'apparence du bras fait beaucoup plus propre que la plupart des modèles bon marché la fixation est extrêmement qualitative et ne bouge absolument pas même en ne serrant pas comme un bourrin (donc celle ci n'abimera pas votre bureau). Elle est d'ailleurs pourvue d'une matière caoutchouc plutôt adhésive sur la partie qui se pose sur le bureau pratique pour mieux stabiliser mais aussi pour ne pas abimer la surface après avoir serré.Les gens lui reproche de remonter tout seul si le micro n'est pas assez lourd: c'est effectivement le cas (et je me suis bien cassé les doigts pour serrer les articulations). Mais pour ma part j'utilise un Beyerdynamic Fox (plutôt léger donc aussi léger qu'un AT2020 ou que le Rode) et je n'ai aucun problème. La partie supérieur remonte toute seule seulement si je la baisse presque contre le bureau et s'arrête pile devant ma bouche pour que je puisse y parler dedans (d'ailleurs le micro se visse à fond avec une légère orientation encore une fois pile devant la bouche). Du coup je pense pas que le bras ait été conçu dans l'optique de supporter le poids du Yeti mais que le bras a surtout été étudié pour se mettre en positions optimales automatiquement car il n'utilise pas les même ressors que les bras bon marché. Je note aussi que le bras se pousse tout seul en arrière lorsque que j'éloigne le micro.Un adaptateur pour le Yeti est vissé dessus retirez-le et vous pourrez visser n'importe quel micro dessus.Pour moi le défaut ce sont ses parties en plastique (les articulations) qui sont irrégulières dans leur forme je sais pas si je suis le seul à avoir ce "problème" mais du coup le bras penche à 2° sur la droite. C'est pas vraiment visible c'est juste que je vois tout.En conclusion: ce léger défaut de finition est assez dommage (à moins que je sois le seul dans ce cas) mais le produit est tellement qualitatif et bien pensé pour le prix que on le lui pardonnera.
4,Blue est une marque sure. Vous pouvez y aller.Les + :- Il est vraiment beau et fait très classe sur mon setup- Il marche super bien avec mon Blue Yeti (petite frayeur au début quand je n'arrivais pas à le laisser plié... En fait il ne marche correctement que lorsqu'un poids comme le Blue Yeti est ajouté en son extrémité pour le tenir). En bref si vous comptez brancher un micro plus léger que le Blue Yeti renseignez vous bien afin de savoir si c'est possible ou non.- Il est haut (peut passez par dessus un écran sans soucis grâce à sa base surélevée et la taille des deux parties du bras.- La poignée pour visser est étroite (jadis j'avais un bureau qui empêchait de visser un bras de microphone car la poignée était trop grosse). Ici pas de soucis le micro peut être mis quasiment partout.Les - :- Son rapport qualité/prix (il est beau il est esthétique il fait le job mais 100€ pour ce bras reste excessivement cher). Si vous avez le budget à mettre dedans allez-y mais je pense qu'il vous serait possible de faire de belles économies pour le même rendu.- Sa faible adaptation.Comme je l'ai dit plus tôt quand il n'y a pas de micros fixés à son extrémité les ressorts du bras le tendent verticalement. Il vous sera impossible de l'utiliser avec des microphones plus légers comme le Bird UM1 par exemple.Je ne regrette pas mon achat.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                           Im Rahmen des Vine-Programms durfte ich das Kondensatormikrofon Blue Baby Bottle SL XLR testen. Da ich bislang nur USB-Mikrophone genutzt habe benötigte ich einen passenden Schwenkarm. Ich schwanke dabei zunächst zwischen dem Røde PSA1 und dem Compass von Blue. Letztendlich entschied ich mich trotz des höheren Preises für den Schwenkarm von Blue da er mir optisch besser gefällt.Der Aufbau war sehr schnell erledigt. Da der Schwenkarm hinter meinen PC-Monitoren stehen sollte habe ich ihn mittels der Klemme an der Rückseite des Tisches montiert den ich dafür kurzzeitig vorziehen musste. Da die Klemme angebracht werden kann ohne dass der Schwenkarm bereits eingesetzt ist stellte dies kein Problem dar.Der Schwenkarm wird einfach in den Fuß eingesteckt und steht dann sehr stabil. Die Anbringung der Mikrofon-Spinne ist ebenfalls kein Problem. Sehr praktisch ist die Kabelführung in den beiden Armteilen in denen das Kabel gut eingelegt werden kann und durch einfache Clips gesichert wird.Ich habe bislang keine Probleme beim Verstellen der Mikrofonarme festgestellt. Das Mikrofon verharrt in der eingestellten Position lässt sich aber dennoch ohne Lösen der Stellschrauben leicht verstellen was ich sehr praktisch finde.Bei der Verarbeitung konnte ich keine Schwächen feststellen. Die Metallarme wirken wertig und sauber verarbeitet. Die Griffe der Stellschrauben bestehen allerdings aus Kunststoff. Ob es möglich ist diese zu überdrehen kann ich nicht beurteilen.Bisher bin ich mit diesem Schwenkarm sehr zufrieden. Bei Nichtgebrauch des Mikrofons kann ich dieses hinter den Monitoren verstecken es aber innerhalb von Sekunden ohne großen Aufwand nach vorne ziehen und damit arbeiten. Ob der Preis gerechtfertigt ist liegt im Auge des Betrachters. Für meinen Geschmack ist er etwas zu hoch aber nicht so dass ich dafür einen Stern abziehen würde.5 von 5 Sternen
4,L' unico difetto è il prezzo molto costoso rispetto alla concorrenza ma ne vale la pena. Non ne faccio un uso professionale ma potrebbe benissimo essere usato in studi di registrazione date le mille possibilità che offre. Le braccia sono fatte di alluminio molto resistente con alle estremità gli snodi in ottima plastica questo dovuto al fatto che è possibile o meno stringere o allentare lo snodo per posizionare il tutto come si vuole (non ho avuto problemi di peso con microfoni pesanti come il podmic da 1kg). Molto importante è l'altezza del braccio fino al primo snodo che misura precisamente 59 cm (misura presa a partire dal tavolo con braccio in verticale compresa di base) e la lunghezza molto importante di tutto il braccio in orizzontale di 91 cm (fino alla vite del mic). Per agganciare il microfono vi è la classica vite con ring (con adattatore già incluso in confezione) per poter utilizzare qualsiasi tipo di shockmount o microfono si voglia ed è bellissima la rifinitura dorata invece del classico argento che molti della concorrenza montano. La morsa per l'aggancio al tavolo è ben fatta ha un pad antiscivolo che assicura una presa salda anche se la vite che va a far pressione sotto il tavolo è in ferro non rivestito e mio avviso un po' piccola.Ottima chicca il passacavo veramente utilissimo per non avere fili pendolanti o essere costretti ad usare fascette antiestetiche.Al momento dell'acquisto ero indeciso tra questo e il psa1 della rode ma l'altezza maggiore il passacavi nascosto e la forma in generale ho preferito spendere qualcosa in più. Ottimo sconto invece per chi volesse prendere tutto il kit con il microfono blueyeti è un affarone per chi non ha grandi esigenze di audio.
5,Cela fait quelques mois depuis l'installation du bras articulé pour mon microphone Blue yeti et j'en suis très satisfaite. Ce bras est fait pour les microphones lourds. La tenu et l'angle sont toujours au top. D'ailleurs il est très facile de pivoter le bras étant donner qu'il est emboité sur la base (qui est accroché au bureau). Je recommande ce produit !
4,Combinazione in uso: BlueYeti Compass + Rode NT/USBSono stato titubante a causa di diverse recensioni che indicavano la poca stabilità del braccio nel mantenimento della posizione voluta.Capisco il motivo per cui tanti si sono trovati male perchè il secondo snodo quello centrale tende effettivamente a tornare alla posizione originale ma nel mio caso una volta montato il microfono e stretto lo snodo il braccio sta lì dove l'ho messo. Anche facendolo ruotare a dx/sx per averlo vicino al viso durante le call oppure lontano se non mi serve. Anche in altezza riesco ad adattarlo senza problemi.Penso che il problema riscontrato da molti possa dipendere molto dal peso del microfono e da quanto ci sia la necessità di cambiargli la posizione durante l'uso.Lato materiali è molto bello e comodo. Lo slot per il cavo è perfetto nascosto completamente. Facile da montare se non il morsetto che da foto mi sembrava poco ingombrante ma purtroppo (come altri supporti che ho) cozza con il mio porta cavi sotto la scrivania che ho dovuto adattare. Sarebbe stato molto meglio uno morsetto con l'asticella mobile così da fare mezzi giri di volta in volta.Ad ogni modo una volta montato nessun problema e molto meglio del braccio originale Rode che avevo e che ho restituito tempo fa poiché quando lo inclinavo andava a toccare con il "gomito" la parete dietro alla scrivania. Questo della Blue è perfetto e non sporge assolutamente.Quindi per ora mi sento di consigliarlo.
5,Utilizzato sia con Blue Yeti e attualmente in uso con Shure MV7.Il braccio rimane in qualsiasi posizione lo mettiate ovviamente se seguite le istruzioni e utilizzate la vite di regolazione della molla (e quindi del peso del microfono)Purtroppo le cattive recensioni che ho letto derivano tutte da questo piccolo dettaglio sfuggito… quindi se la comprate e vi trovate in difficoltà guardate sotto (dove si infila il braccio nel supporto a scrivania) e troverete la vita di regolazione come indicato nelle istruzioni…
4,Leider hat der Arm schon nach kurzer Zeit schlapp gemschtundfunktioniert nicht mehr wie er sollte. Das feststellen des Armes in der passenden Position ist mir zudem nie gelungen weil sich die Feststellschauben trotz enorme Kraft nicht wirkluc feststellen lasse.
5,Franchement c'est l'un des bras de micro le plus cher MAIS ! Il est incroyable ça n'a rien avoir un bras de micro "classique" comme neewer.Si vous êtes à l'aise niveau argent foncé sans hésiter.
4,Acheté séparément du micro je trouve que cette perche est un indispensable pour celles et ceux qui ont un setup bien fourni (multi-écrans webcam ...).De bonne qualité avec une armature composée de bras métalliques et de rotules PVC résistantes elle s'équilibre relativement bien.La fixation au bureau est commune à ses concurrentes et les bagues d'ajustement de tension sur chaque rotule ont une bonne ergonomie et son manipulable facilement à la volée (pas besoin d'une clé ou d'un outil quelconque).A l'utilisation au quotidien j'y trouve un seul bémol malgré l'acharnement sur les bagues d'ajustement vous ne pourrez pas régler la position du micro à l'exactitude de votre envie. Entre l'équilibre du bras le léger manque de précision sur les bagues de serrage il y aura potentiellement un battement de quelques cm entre le choix de votre positionnement et celui pris par la perche. Attention ce battement se fera ressentir uniquement sur quelques postions bien particulières. Dans la grande majorité vous ne sentirez aucune gêne.
5,I have Custom Van den Hull cables and was not sure if they would fit with this arm they do!There are some negative reviews for this arm that I just don't see with mine ether people didn't take the time to adjust it before reviewing. who knows!Its solid very well built indeed!I found that if you tighten up the arm to the point where it only just not straightening up on you then you get a really light to move arm. way better than some of the others I have had.I have had the innogear arm for $50 is good and longer than this one so say better behind the monitors.I have had a cheap unbranded arm for $15 and this is by far the lightest thing to move and I still love it.Getting this blue had to compete with the cheap one I love so much and the innogear that was perfect for keeping the studio clean.The Blue Compass apart from not being long enough to reach over the monitors it has exceeded my expectations.It has taken a while to get it adjusted right as I had things over tightened to begin with.  now its set right its light to move solid as a rock. and I'm very happy it takes a bit of time to get it set just right.I am using an Audio Technical AT4047 with mine so not the most heavy mic!Nothing more than fantastic.It cost quite a bit so for the home user it may be overkill unless you have the cash and need the look!if I was not a Streamer then I would not have brought this as the cheap one is amazing in function and really really did the trick with my AT3035.
3,Preferez lui le RODE PSA1 solide mais ne tiens pas l'orientation du micro. Le serrage maximum des axes est encore beaucoup trop faible et il n'est pas possible de "soulever" le micro le bras va d'abortd se déplier puis ensuite lever le microphone bras tendu
5,excellent
3,il et très difficile de le manipulé en plus il remonte souvent tous seul même en serrant ou la desserrant la vis en dessous du pied ou au articulation très imposant lourd
5,Must have if you love comfort when using your PC and want to design your place. Absolutely recommend 👌
5,One of the things that sets a studio apart from others is the quality of the equipment and mic boom arms are almost ten a penny. Unless you go for the really expensive Yellowtec stuff of course. this arm from Blue is a suitable halfway measure - not massively expensive (comparable to Rode and others in price) and a style reminiscent of the Yellowtec gear.I'd prefer to have the XLR cable fully enclosed for aesthetic reasons but otherwise this arm looks and performs well. The desk mount is strong and of you're at all handy with DIY you could theoretically mount it through the desk quite easily with the right nut bolt and washer. Of course it works pretty well as designed.Support for it from Blue is not good - things like desk mounts are available but only to the US customers. I wrote asking Blue about that and still have no response from them. I wouldn't hold your breath on that! Just get a US postal box and have a desk mount sent over.Overall I am very pleased - I bought two. They are sturdy easy to set up no external springs all the friction brakes and dampers work well... it's also remarkably smooth to swivel and the mic attachment is very good - locks perfectly and makes a big difference compared to the cheaper alternatives.Yes you can buy a scissor style angle-poise design for a tenth of the price. You get what you pay for - having been through 5 such arms I am pleased with the quality and workmanship of this arm... now... if only the XLR was internal ;)
4,Questa asta per microfono è bellissima e comodissima da utilizzare... il suo unico difetto come avevo anche visto su YouTube è che è tarata per essere utilizzata con un microfono molto pesante (Come il blue yeti ad esempio). Questo fa si che se utilizzata con un microfono più leggero (come il mio Shure MV7) non rimane precisamente in posizione. La tensione esercitata sul braccio infatti per quanto sia regolabile è sempre eccessiva. Per il resto è davvero TOP!
4,Sto usando questa asta con un Røde PodMic e devo ammettere che sono un pò deluso. non sempre il microfono rimane nella giusta posizione ma tende sempre al alzarsi o spostarsi. per il prezzo che ha mi sarei aspettato di più
3,It works for me. No issues it just works.
3,It does the job looks good cable tidy I just find it too tight not enough flexibility. I wonder if the do an underarm version? Might be a better option if your looking for something that doesn't want to stick in front of your face all the time. More suited for angle shots if vlogging.
5,Als ich die Packung öffnete schauten mich alle Teile direkt an: Der Arm in der Mitte außen noch die Tischklemme und eine Betriebsanleitung.Der Compass wirkt sehr hochwertig und ist auch schön anzufassen. Es sieht unglaublich elegant aus und besteht aus Aluminium. Die Schrauben-ähnliche Teile zum Einrasten der Gelenke sind aber aus Plastik. Der Arm ist auch noch sehr dünn! Das hat mich stark beeindruckt.Das Anschrauben war genauso einfach wie bei anderen Gelenkarmen. Klemme an den Tisch Ding rein fertig. Der Blue Compass ist einsatzbereit. Dabei ist die Tischklemme im Gegensatz zu anderen Armen so dick wie der Arm selber. Sie ist also sehr praktisch und nimmt kaum Platz weg.Vorne befindet sich eine 3/8" Schraube welche mit einem 5/8" Adapter kommt aber auch mit einer anderen Art Scheibe um das Mikrofon so zu befestigen dass es in einer gewünschten Position verschraubt wird ohne komplett eingedreht werden zu müssen.Außerdem gibt Blue Microphones noch eine Möglichkeit das Kabel am Arm "unsichtbar" an das Mikro zu bringen. Dabei wurde das mit Klips-Teilen gelöst welche am Arm von der Basis bis zum Mikrofon das Kabel leiten. Die Klipse werden einfach geöffnet oder geschlossen.An der Basis kann eine Schraube gedreht werden um die Härte der Federn einstellen zu können. Das ist von Vorteil wenn man ein schweres Mikrofon hat. Ab Werk dürfte jedoch alles stimmen.Beim Anschließen war ich geschockt: Das Befestigen meines knapp 15kg schweren Mikrofones von unten war zum Scheitern verurteilt. Das letzte Gelenk hat trotz festgedrehter Schrauben immer nachgelassen.Das Befestigen vom Mikrofon von oben war allerdings komplett anders: Null Probleme die Gelenke rasten ein selbst ohne festmachen der Schrauben an der Seite.Beim Rode PSA-1 hatte ich ein lautes mechanisches Geräusch beim Bewegen der Gelenke. Das ist hier überhaupt nicht der Fall. Der Arm ist sehr ruhig.Der Preis? Nun ja vielleicht etwas überteuert. Das muss jedoch jeder selbst entscheiden. Vom Aussehen her und der Tatsache dass der Arm durch seine Form sehr praktisch ist hebt er sich allerdings deutlich von anderen Armen ab.Ich werde den Compass im Alltag nun testen und dann die Bewertung ggf. anpassen.
5,J'ai décider d'investir dans plus qu'un bras articulé à 30€ trop faiblard ou qui casse au bout de 3 mois je me suis donc diriger vers Blue cette marque de microphones entre autres.Et je en suis pas déçu du tout la qualité est au rendez vous ainsi que la solidité. Extrêmement facile à mettre en place ce bras permet de mouvoir facilement son micro.C'est vrai que ça peut paraître cher juste pour un bras articulé mais c'est amorti par la qualité et la robustesse de ce produit. De plus il possède un "cache câble" vraiment pratique !Je recommande fortement ce produit !
2,It looks ok BUT it doesn’t hold the mic in the desired position. It always goes up 10-15 cm and it doesn’t matter how tight the stand was fixed. I could understand if I had some 3rd party microphone BUT it is Yeti microphone… unfortunately I can’t return it because I had a long vacation and it is too late already to return
4,Die Qualität und die Herstellung sehen Top aus  aber für mein Shure Mv7 leider ungeeignet das es nicht in der Position bleibt sondern sich immer bewegt.
2,When it comes to designing a useful product the way the product is used is essential. Blue Compass fails in an unexpected way here.I bought this to replace my £23 boom arm that broke. I use it mostly for work and I need to be able to set it aside while not needed.This boom arm can only collapse in one way actually even that is crippled by its design. To have only one internal spring that allows you to place the microphone where you needed.Yes but for me the most important part was what do I do when I don't need the microphone. And this is where Compass Premium etc fails. You can't just put it away. It will lift your microphone quite high and if you have a setup like mine where the desk can be raised it looks super weird.As a conclusion the inability to collapse in a different way makes this arm usable in setups where the microphone will always stay in one place.I ended up using only the clamp with my old microphone arm.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 First of all its a second hand product delivered to without any manual inside it and the seal was broken already and the main thing is the rotating knob mechanism not working
5,Me parece un brazo elegante estético que no produce ningún tipo de ruido al moverse. Su resistencia es ajustable y su agarre es excepcional!Sin dudas lo volvería a comprar de nuevo!
4,Excellent build stable sleek clean and sturdy keeps the cable tidily away and is extremely silent when moved. Only gripe is that compared with spring based systems the orientation of the last articulated segment holding the mic is not kept fixed but it has to be corrected independently of the rest after each repositioning of the arm unlike PSA-1 and cheaper alternatives where it is kept level. A minor issue that may become a nuisance for those that tend to reposition the mic continuously as you'd have to handle the shock mount to do this possibly generating some noise while recording. Also you need to tighten the friction screws quite hard to set it in position... otherwise there is a little droop or upward drift over time but I read this can be calibrated tightening a tension key at the base.Also I would check out the yeticaster bundle just 25 pounds more and you also get a yeti mic which has a unique serial number and therefore can be used in conjunction with another yeti if you already have one.
2,Ich habe den Arm mit dem HyperX Quadcast verwendet ein recht leichtes USB Mikrofon.Das mittlere Gelenk im Arm tendiert sich immer mit viel Spannung zu strecken deswegen musste ich das mittlere Gelenk auch ziemlich stark mit dem Anpassungsrad fixieren. Und trotzdem streckte der Arm sich dann über eine längere Zeit wieder langsam etwas aus.Und nach fast einen Monat hat das Anpassungsrad einfach aufgegeben. es kam lose und ich konnte direkt sehen dass das Rad überhaupt nicht gut durchdacht mit der spannungsschraube verbunden war.Diese Konstruktion inspiriert nicht wirklich Vertrauen (siehe Foto) weswegen ich eine Rücksendung und Erstattung eingeleitet habe.Abgesehen von das mittlere Anpassungsrad ist die restliche Konstruktion sehr hochwertig schlicht und designtechnisch schön weswegen das hier kein Bewertung mit nur einen Stern ist.Falls du ein ziemlich schweres Mikrofon hast oder vielleicht auch bereit bist weiteres Gewicht am Ende des Armes zu montieren könnte es sein dass man das mittlere Rad nicht so stark anspannen muss und dass es dann einigermaßen funktioniert.
5,Does the job well and in style. Better reach than most other boom arms. I was looking for a pro looking boom arm for my AKG P220 and was considering the BLUE and the RODE PSA. I liked the pro look of the BLUE the provision for concealing the XLR cable and the smooth movements with ZERO noise. If you have a desk setup that you can mount this arm on considering its dimensions and desk space available just go for it. Sturdy build nicely heavy - enough to feel good and inspire confidence that it is not going to drop your expensive mic. Will last a whole lifetime.
4,Au final il y a toujours un mais il est excellent on sent qu'il va tenir dans le temps par contre la tension n'est pas excellente et ne permet pas de mettre le micro dans toutes les positions que l'on veut (si le condo est léger.). Le bras aura tendance à se déplier même avec les bloqueurs à fond et la tension au minimum.
3,Also das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt hier eigentlich. Man kriegt einen wirklich ordentlichen und stabilen Mikrofonarm welcher wirklich hochwertig aussieht und einem 400€ Arm sehr ähnelt. Von der Qualität bin ich sehr begeistert eine tolle Farbe und die Stabilität macht auf mich einen soliden Eindruck. Dennoch ist er eventuell ein bisschen zu stark für den normalen Markt ich kann diesen gerade so nutzen obwohl ich ein 780g schweres Mikrofon benutze. Ich musste sowohl die Schraube unten weit lockern als auch die obere linke Drehschraube fest anziehen sodass das Mikrofon nicht nach oben fliegt. Das funktioniert jetzt auch so ist meiner Meinung nach aber eher für Mikrofone ab 1kg richtig gut. Optisch muss sich der Arm wirklich nicht verstecken eine tolle Kabelführung lässt Ihn im Vergleich zur Konkurrenz noch einmal deutlich hochwertiger wirken und auch die stabilen massiven Elemente ohne Luftdurchlass wirken Klasse. Die Schraube und Rotierung ist definitiv auch besser als bei der Konkurrenz verbraucht weniger Platz sieht optisch besser aus und ist auch noch leichter zu bedienen 360 Grad komplett drehbar. Warum der Mikrofonarm von mir trotzdem nur 3 Sterne bekommt ist dem hohen Preis zu Schulden und der Tatsache dass man diesen wirklich nur mit sehr hochwertigen und schweren Mikrofonen benutzen kann. Bei meinem mit 780g bin ich wirklich an der unteren Grenze um diesen zu nutzen und das mit einem verhältnismäßig schweren Mikrofon. Die meisten wiegen knapp 350-600. Dennoch kann ich diesen Mikrofonarm jedem empfehlen der auf Optik wert legt ein schweres Mikrofon und das nötige Kleingeld hat.
5,I've been doing online teaching of late and got a Blue Yeti microphone. Soon after getting it I realised that the microphone needs to be pretty close to one's mouth to get the best results. I looked at adjustable desktop stands and cheaper boom arms but they didn't look quite right. They either looked cheap or like they wouldn't last. Some even required drilling a hole into a desk to fit them which sounded pretty unappealing! This one was under £100 from Amazon Warehouse and makes my Yeti really easy to position. It feels well made and seems like an excellent product.
4,Make sure your microphone fits the weight requirements. In my case I did attach an AT2020 (lighweight microphone) to the arm. In fact even at the lowest tension the microphone is still pulled up and therefore I cannot use that arm.In general I could say the arm is pretty strong made of good materials and has a good stand base. However you definitely need to check if your microphone has approximatively the same weight as the Blue Yeti because is arm is built for this microphone.In conclusion 5 stars because it is well made minus one star because it doesn't support my AT2020 microphone.
5,
5,Acheter récemment avec le Blue Yeti X et le support "Radius III" pas présent sur la photo je trouve ce bras de très très bonne qualité mais quand même vraiment chère pour un bras micro de ce type... de plus il faut rajouter 70 euros pour le support car sinon vos interlocuteurs peuvent entendre quelques vibrations lorsque vous écrivez sur votre clavier...
4,Aufgrund der cleanen Optik habe ich mich für den Compass entschieden obwohl es günstigere und qualitativ gleichwertige Alternativen gibt.Ich benutze den Arm für das Blue Yeti und das einstellen der Spannung über die Schraube an der Base ging sehr schnell und unkompliziert.Das Mikro hängt stabil und die Clips zum Kabelmanagement sorgen für einen cleanen Look ohne Kabelsalat.Wie er sich mit anderen Mikrofonen verhält kann ich nicht beurteilen aber für das Blue Yeti kann ich den Compass empfehlen.Daumen hoch!
1,I tried posing it but it always moved slowly upwards. When I tried to tighten it the plastic knob snapped and the arm slammed into me like a whip. I'm not sure if it was defective but it appears to be a low-quality potentially dangerous product.
5,A ver como describo este brazo. He tenido algunos sentimientos desencontrados con este soporte. Primero que es muy fuerte y robusto soporta bien los pesos de los micros que le he puesto.  Hay que tener en cuenta que estos brazos no son como los articulados con un muelle son menos flexibles y no sirven en todas las situaciones. Ademas se mueve mucho hacia un lado por el peso del micro. No se mantiene mucho en su posicion  suele bajar mucho  hay que hacer mucha fuerza en las tuercas laterales para que se mantenga en su sitio y aun asi es dificil que lo mantenga. No he visto tampoco opcion a que se fije directamente en una mesa como otros brazos. En cualquier caso no creo que lo comprara si no fuera por estar en la seccion de Amazon Wharehouse Deals.
3,Der Arm ist nur für schwere Mikrofone geeignet! Bei leichteren Mikrofonen hält die extrem starke Spannung im Arm das Mikrofon nicht unten - es rutscht immer wieder hoch. Der Arm macht zudem nicht den Eindruck als wäre er das Geld wert. Hatte hier mehr erhofft im Vergleich zur günstigen Konkurrenz.
2,Recientemente he pedido 2.El primero que he abierto estaba en perfectas condiciones e incluía todas las piezas perfectamente embaladas.El segundo sin embargo no venía en buenas condiciones:- Al abrir la caja las espumas protectoras estaban desplazadas y la bolsa de plástico que se supone contiene el brazo estaba abierta y separada del brazo- El brazo venía con roturas en el plástico (ver fotos)- No venía con el adaptador de 3/8” a 5/8”Da la sensación de ser un producto de segunda mano que se ha vuelto a embalar.Para un producto relativamente caro no creo que sea aceptable.
3,Il remplit sa fonction première à merveille il tient mon SM7B comme si de rien n'était toutefois impossible de le maintenir en position repliée même avec la vis de tension déserrée au maximum. Dommage... C'était presque parfait !
3,While it has good build quality and easy setup BY GOD the spring is way too tight. Even after adjusting it using the screw as loose as it can go and overtightening the thumb screws my Blue Yeti (the mic this arm is designed for) still climbs.
3,The product seems a great quality and looks solid but when assembled its stiffness blocks the arm to be positioned in a bent states - it stretches back to its initial state. The arm offers to adjust the stiffness but I loosened up it as much as it allowed and it still fails to be controlled as cheaper brands can.
3,Su diseño es muy bonito y estético pero para que no se levante o quede fijo hay que apretar cada vez. Incómodo por su precio.
5,I love the quality and material. It’s sturdy and makes no noise at all.
5,Acheter 86€ j'ai sauter sur l'occasion et je ne le regrette pas il respire la solidité et on sent tout de suite qu'on a pas à faire à de la camelote. Sa fixation est bien orientable et se fixe parfaitement (même sur un bureau en verre) le bras dispose d'un passe câble plutôt bien fait et la fixation pour le micro est standard il me semble je n'ai pas eu de mal à y fixé mon AudioTechnica AT2020 en tout cas.Le seul bémol pour moi est son prix par rapport au bras de chez Rode à acheté quand le prix est en baisse donc.
4,Solides Teil erfüllt seine Funktion. Die Gelenke muss man von Hand ziemlich fest ziehen was relativ anstrengend ist und wenn man den Arm ruckartig bewegt bigt sich die am Tisch befestigte Base etwas was ungesund aussieht aber im großen und ganzen ein solides Teil mit Kaufempfehlung.
5,Da ich eine Halterung benötigte mit der es möglich ist selbst von der Montage hinter meinen Bildschirmen ohne Probleme an das entsprechende Mikrofon zu kommen und dennoch weiterhin die vollen Freiheiten mit nutzen kann habe ich mich für diese entschieden.Durch die kompakte Bauform und der sehr stabilen Tischhalterung ist kein wackeln auf dem Tisch selbst möglich die Halterung für nur einfach auf das Tischmodul gesteckt und schon kann man direkt sein Mikrofon montieren.Da ich das Suhre SM7B verwende musste es eine Halterung sein die auch schwerere Mikrofone aushalten kann auch hier wieder gar kein Problem.Durch die Kabelclips ist es zudem möglich das XLR-Kabel innerhalb der Halterung zu verstecken wodurch es nur am oberen und unteren Teil der Halterung sichtbar ist.Ist kann daher die Halterung nur wärmstens weiterempfehlen!
2,I was waiting to get the RODE PSA1 Mic Arm due to it being out of stock for a few months. When it was back in stock I planned to get it immediately but then saw this new Blue Compass Arm had been released. They were the same price and after watching some reviews I decided to give this one a try instead.This stand is simply not easy to use. It is stiff the thumbscrews at the joints don't do a good job of holding the arm in the position you want it it is relatively short (a problem that is amplified by its lack of flexibility) and after a month of use it stopped being able to support the weight of my microphone (an Audio Technica AT2020 XLR). I honestly had a better experience using my much cheaper Neewer Mic Arm.The only positives I can give this are that it feels really high quality and I like the clips it has to hold the microphone cable in place. It's a really neat and stylish mic arm but functionality is more important than aesthetics to me.I eventually bought the RODE PSA1 to replace it and the experience has been so much better - it's essentially a more premium Neewer Mic Arm which is pretty much all I wanted.I'd recommend to just get the RODE over this one since they are the same price.Edit: Just noticed that the price has jumped from £60 to £100. Now it is absolutely not worth getting. Avoid this one!
5,Produit de bonne facture à l'apparence robuste et ergonomique.La gouttière passe-câble est la bienvenue. Son côté tubulaire plein est très esthétique.Cependant les articulations (qui remontent seule à l'aide d'un ressort) sont tellement dure à serrer qu'il m'a fallut quelques jours d'usure pour que le bras devienne moins résistant et que je puisse enfin le mettre dans la position souhaitée. Sans micro n'y comptez pas trop mais le poids du mien a suffit a le maintenir en place. Étrangement le bras devient bien plus maniable il devient possible de déplacer le micro vers le haut et vers le bas sans problème.Bref sans ce léger contretemps que Blue nous impose à l'achat c'est un bon produit.
4,I finally took the plunge and bought it and unfortunately I had to send it back.It is well made but my microphone was too light and I had to stiffen it so much that I could not move it.If you have a microphone with some weight then this would do the job perfectly. It looks good well made and looks the part when recording video.
5,Installé depuis quelques semaine pour un Shure SM7B. J’ai pris en plus le A26X Tube d’extension afin d’avoir une aisance pour la connectivité XLR et pouvoir tourner le micro à la guise. Sinon le XLR du micro « tape » sur le support du Compass quand on veut le tourner. Réglable grâce à une vis de force il convient parfaitement après quelques minutes de tests et de réglages.
3,Der Arm hält mein SM7Bnicht wirklich wenn er etwas gestreckt ist egal wie fest man die Schrauben dreht.Mit dem NT1A hat er weniger Probleme aber auch da muss man die Schrauben echt fest ziehen!Und da ich schon so oft gehört habe dass da wohl keine Federn drin sind... doch! Der Arm "schießt" nach oben wenn man ihn beim Mic abschrauben nicht festhält. Die Federn sind nicht so stark wie beim PSA1 doch trotzdem deutlich spürbar.Jetzt zum positiven:Der Compass ist ziemlich gut verarbeitet (3 Sterne bei Qualität/Haltbarkeit wegen der schlechten Tragfähigkeit) und größtenteils aus Metall... nur die Schrauben nicht!Er hat einen Kabelkanal worin man das entsprechende Kabel wunderbar verstecken kann sofern der Input am Mic auch in der nähe des Kanals liegt. Zum Bespiel mein NT1A hat den XLR Port an der Unterseite was dazu führt dass über 40cm (ja nachgemessen) Kabel frei liegen.Alles in allem ein super Arm wenn man entweder ein sehr leichtes Mic hat oder den Arm nicht besonders weit ausstreckt.
4,Clairement je l’adore.Il est robuste on peut ajuster et bloquer le bras du micro comme on le souhaite et il y’a même une gouttière pour passer le câble du micro. Je le préfère au rode.Il est toutefois un peu (trop) cher à son tarif habituel ..
5,Nikel çà passe correctement au dessus de mes écran du coup je peux le fixer derrière eux avec les pieds qui supporte déjà mes trois screen et avec un bureau d'un profondeur de 90 cm le micro arrive juste devant moi c'est juste OP du coup rien n'a redire si ce n'est que le véritable prix neuf est de 109euros et pas 129 moi je l'ai chopé a 109 avec une promo mais si vous vous renseigner bien vous verrez que vous pouvez le chopé a 109€ après a vous de voir.
3,The base of the unit should include a support plate instead of a hollow circular stem. The hollow circular stem causes damage to any surface.The twist knob to secure a mic or shock mount in place is just ridiculous and will force you to keep it in a set position because of the screw and thumb-lock length.  This would have been easily fixed with two counter thumb-locks.Poor design for a overpriced piece of equipment really expected better from Blue.Does not Stand straight and will lead to one side cause of the lack of base support.Really should give it a awful rating but it does have a thick arm. Just needs a couple of fixes.
5,Everything about this is excellent with the exception of the neck being sold separately and the overall price but there is no denying that this is a very sturdy bit of kit.
3,Oui je trouve que le produit est de bonne qualité et très beau esthétiquement parlant mais concernant le systeme de serrage je suis sceptique. J'ai un blue Yeti en micro et il faut serrer comme une brute la partie du milieu pour tenter de le bloquer a la bonne position.Quand on voit les vidéos en ligne avec ce meme micro le serrage ne semble pas si dure et les personnes le positionne ou ils veulent...Meme avec la vis de serrage en dessous ca ne change rien...Donc si quelqu'un a l'astuce je suis preneur mais il semble vouloir se mettre à une position optimal et hauteur minimum.
3,Nachdem ich mir vor geraumer Zeit ein Blue Yeti Mikrofon zugelegt hatte war es nun an der Zeit mir noch einen Schwenkarm zu zulegen.Da ich vom BlueYeti-Produkt überzeugt war viel die Entscheidung nicht schwer.Nach kurzem Versand war der Arm dann auch vor Ort. Positiv aufgefallen ist mir vor allem das schlichte und doch moderne Design des Schwenkarms sowie der Kabelschacht zum verlegen des USB-Kabels.Die Montage der Tischklemme und des Mikrofons war allerdings schon das einfachere Anliegen.Kommen wir nun zum negativen Aspekt an diesem Arm.Die Feststellschrauben können bis zu einem gewissen Grad festgeschraubt werden. Danach müssten Bodybuilder mit Feingefühl ran. Den versprochenen 90° Winkel konnte ich nicht herstellen da der Arm sich immer wieder um ein paar Grad nach oben verstellte.Außerdem kann es dazu kommen z.B. wie bei mir der Fall dass die Feststellschraube/feder am oberen Gelenk durchdreht und man auf einmal keinen Widerstand und somit auch keine Feststellwirkung mehr hat.Das neu gelieferte Produkt funktioniert aber definitv besser als das Alte obwohl der 90°-Winkel noch immer nicht bleibt wie er eigentlich sollte.Dennoch ist dieser Schwenkarm eine gute Anschaffung. Sollte sich dieser Mangel noch einmal wiederholen muss ich leider meine Rezension nochmals anpassen.
5,Ce bras est vraiment simple d'installation et très quali !
5,I like the sturdiness and strength of this arm it can hold any of my mic's comfortable. After adjsting and training it at the start it is now in the ideal location and can swing positions for different circumstances at a touch. A touch too expensive in my opinion but overall very pleased with the stand and would recommend it to others.
4,Robuster Kamera/Mikrofonarm schafft viel Platz auf dem Schreibtisch.  Gelenke sind etwas schwergängig. Sehr gut der USB-Kabelkanal.
5,Für mein RODE NT-USB Mikrofon brauchte ich noch einen passenden Boom Arm.Dieser hier passt hervorragend und ist absolut edel vom Aussehen/Material herdas rechtfertigt den Preis allemal.Es knarzt nichts er hält seine Position und sieht schön kompakt aus dank derKabelführung und des einzelnen dicken Arms.Die Feststellknöpfe sind zwar aus Kunststoff fühlen sich aber nicht billig an.Das sie überdrehen könnten glaube ich eher nicht allerdings habe ich dasGlück jetzt auch nicht herausgefordert und beim Festziehen sofort aufgehörtwenn der Widerstand zu hoch wurde.
1,Reçu ce matin même pour soutenir un Shure SMB7Autant dire que j'aurai mieux fait de m'abstenir. ce bras est certes solide mais c'est une véritable plaie lorsqu'il s'agit de faire les différents réglages qui dans mon cas se sont avérés infructueux car peu importe à quel point la vis de tension du ressors est dévissé le bras remonte TOUJOURS à son maximum à se demander si ce n'est pas un défaut sur mon produit mais à ce prix je ne m'attends pas à avoir un défaut aussi impactant sur l'utilisation finale. Dans le doute à éviter.
2,I bought this as a replacement for my Rode Arm which is a bit ugly and loud with the spring noises.This arm claims to be very flexible and toolless.However I've found that the hand tightening screws completely fail to keep the arm in place. This is especially true for lighter microphones- the arm always tends to rise up no matter how hard you tighten the middle joint.The hidden screw at the bottom doesn't do much to alleviate the issue unfortunately.Does it look better than the Rode? Yes!Does it work better- unfortunately no- I find this design to be much more cumbersome. And with a good shock mount on the Rode the results are great.Blue need to re-think their design in my opinion.
4,Difícil de usar y duro de manipular.
4,vraiment super qualité je trouve juste dommage qu'il n'y ait pas de joint en caoutchouc sur la base
5,Brilliant mic stand for vlogging.
5,Es un gasto superior a otros brazos que realizan la misma función. En mi caso presenta estás características positivas que convencen calidad-precio:-Sujeción a modo de gato. No precisa de agujeros en la mesa.-Permite configuraciones varias para tener el micrófono al gusto. Más práctico.-Muy estético en comparación con los que muestran su mecanismo interno (muelles etc.) Además el cable del micrófono se puede esconder en una pasarela interna del brazo.
4,… er nicht schon defekt angekommen wäre. Kann passieren (Transportschaden) habe dann aber den Tonor gekauft.
1,The tension on this product is handled with "hand screws" so to speak. This keeps the tension when you move it about so you can place it where you want it to be. I put the mic up and down a few times a week. It took a year for the bottom tension to breaks so now it just to the desk.Workable. but absolutely broken.A friend of mine showed me one he bought for 20 quid and it had a much better range of motion so... I think save your money.
5,Now it did take a bit of understanding to work tge adjustment mechanism but now it works great and can easily move out of the way.
4,C'est un très bon produit mais au niveau du prix je suis un peu déçu par le serrage de ce matériel qui a tendance même serré dès qu'il y a du poids où dès qu'on les touche ah ne pas tenir sa position donc pour ça que je la mets dans cette positions là
3,I want a mic stand that will hold a mic wherever I put itThis doesn't do thatThe stand is either lifting or dropping depending on the lateral extension of the armYes of course I have adjusted the screw adjuster in the base and the friction knobs on the jointsIt still drifts up or downI use a Blue yeti (heavy) mic it might work with lighter mics
4,Costoso e non è il massimo della resistenza. Mi tocca usarlo con un microfono di max 300g. Per non farlo inclinare verso terra
3,Mediocre because the tightening doesn’t quite work as well and I even went thru 2 of them because I thought I’d gotten a defective one but no they’re all like that. The mic needs to be attached for the arm to barely hold position contrary to what the instructions say.
5,wenn der arm unter (geschätzt) 160 Grad in der Mitte hat geht der arm nicht runter.wenn man aber die ganze länge verwenden möchte ist der arm nichts. (in Benutzung mit Rode PodMic)durch die untere schraube und dann durch die seitlichen Leicht! festziehen (sonst könnte es durch abrieb kaputt gehen) bis man die perfekt eingestellt hat braucht man eine weile.Kabel lässt sich schön verlegen sieht clean aus.
5,The media could not be loaded.
4,Este brazo es de muy buena calidad y es el mejor complemento para el micrófono blue yeti  junto con el soporte tipo araña "Radius" 100% compatible aunque su precio es elevado.Te permite muchos movimientos pudiendo colocar el micro en cualquier posicion no hay nada mejor.Existe la opción de comprarlo en kit (micro soporte y brazo) que en relación es más económico y altamente interesante...................................................Valora como "util" esta reseña me ayudaria mucho.GRACIAS.By MikiMaister...
5,Troppo duro
3,So it's really really hard. Can't stay at same position and will become straight by itselfs. Not recommended. I actually asked for refund but itvwas replaced instead.
2,Schade der Boom Arm gefällt mir vom Design her wirklich gut aber für mich ist er eine Fehlkonstruktion. Das mittlere Gelenk hat viel zu viel Spannung und egal wie sehr ich mich bemühe es war für mich nicht möglich ihn passend einzustellen.Angeblich kommt er voreingestellt für ein Blue Yeti. Ich habe ein Blue Yeti X das nochmal schwerer ist und der Boom Arm war wirklich nicht zu gebrauchen.Auch mit Anleitung und YouTube Tutorials habe ich es nicht hinbekommen dass der Boom Arm vernünftig eingestellt ist. Auf dem mittleren Gelenk war immer viel zu viel Spannung. Wer es schafft ihn einzustellen bekommt einen stylischer Boom Arm. Für die Preisklasse erwarte ich da aber mehr Komfort und Einfachheit.Bevor ich eines der Gelenke zerstöre (die wegen des Plastiks nicht wirklich haltbar wirken) geht er deshalb zurück und ich werde wohl doch zum PSA1 von Rode greifen. Schade der ist einfach nicht so chick wie der Compass.
5,Good and sturdy i have a pretty weighty microphone (Samson q9u) and this comfortably holds it in place. Good buy could be cheaper but personally worth it for the aesthetics
4,I upgraded to this from a much cheaper and less quality mount. Was very happy with its studyness and the cable track management
5,Looks incredible. Love the cable channel down the back of the arm keeps everything looking visually very clean.Mine came set up to support a very heavy microphone (probably the Blue Yeti). I use the much lighter MXL 770 so had to slacken off the spring-tension screw set into the base many many rotations to allow the friction clamps at the hinges to set its position. Now that's done it raises and rotates smoothly.One improvement they could make would be a built-in axial swivel after the final joint but that's a small thing.
5,Il miglior braccio per microfono in circolazione costruito con materiali ottimi. Caratteristica fondamentale la possibilità di poter passare il cavo dentro guide presenti. Il prezzo è alto rispetto alla concorrenza ma ne vale assolutamente la pena perchè il livello è superiore alla media.
2,Déçu par cet achat. Je pensais que la renommée de la marque méritait d'investir dans ce bras pour sa qualité de finition et sa robustesse mais je suis déçu. J'aurais su j'aurais pris un Oplite ou un RODE psa1 car le produit parait épais mais est fragile avec des imperfections et pliures/chevauchements dès le déballage qui ne méritent pas un tel prix. J'espère qu'il durera dans le temps mais je ne racheterais pas auprès de cette marque. Comparez-bien... un rode psa-01 me parait rétrospectivement parlant être un meilleur achat rapport qualité/prix.
5,Very good
5,Simple to use highly versatile beautifully made solid and works perfectly with most microphones. I have a large Shure SM7B; if you have this mic you will also need the Shure A26X extension tube. It will work without it but mic movement is limited. It looks really cool too.
5,Top
5,Den ersten Ausleger-Arm hatte ich zurückgeschickt weil er sicht - auf den ersten Blick - gar nicht einstellen lässt und sich die Gelenke nicht vernünftig einstellen lassen. Tatsächlich funktioniert aber alles großartig wenn man das schwere Yeti X anschraubt. Gut dass ich das nocht gemacht habe bevor ich alles zurück geschickt habe :-)So wurde auf den zweiten Blick alles gut ein hervorragendes Gelenk.
1,Kompatibilität der eigenen Produkte nicht gegeben:- Stecker kollidiert mit Kontermutter vom Adapter- Arm ist viel zu stark für die kleinen MikrofoneKompatibilität wird aber angepriesenauch Kontakt mit Support ist nur Mäßig (ACHTUNG: LOGITECH Konto nötig... -.-)ich solle das Mikrofon doch drehen.... -.--> Einstellung der Federkraft ist ein Witz -> war auf locker noch viel zu stark (Hinweis an den Hersteller: es gibt Kreuzschlitz schrauben und Pozidrive Schrauben -> man sollte nicht mit dem falschen Bit in der falschen Schraube rumrühren.... -.-)
1,Eigentlich habe ich mich sehr auf den Arm gefreut - Er sieht cool aus es gibt unzählige zolle Youtube Videos die ihn hypen leider musste ich der Realität ins Auge sehen: Handling: Ausgepackt Spannnungsschraube gelockert montiert und es ging los: Es ist ein auf den ersten Blick toll aussehendes Katapult - nach maximaler lockerung und diversen versuchen die plastikgelenkschrauben zu adjusten gab es keine möhlichkeit den Arm zuverlässig in verschiedenen positionen zu nutzen - evtl ist es besser mit einem schwereren mic ( ad hyper X war auf jedenfall zu leicht - aber selbst mit einem schwereren Mic erwarte ich hier probleme. Quality: Nach kurzem hinschauen schwindet der erste Style eindruck: Plastik von oben bis unten gelenke die unter druck aufgehen plastik dass sich dehnt - mir war klar wenn ich diese. arm behalte ist er in 3-4monaten kaputt... Ich habe ihn zurückgeschickt und durch den günstigeren Rode PSA1 ersetzt: und siehe da - Rode macht alles was man vom teureren Compass erwartet hätte perfekt!!! Ich hoffe ich kann jemandem hiermit doe Frustration ersparen und kann Blue dazu einladen das Produkt zu verbessern 😋✌🏼
5,Bombenfest sage ich nur hält seit nem jahr so und man musste nicht mal nachspannen bissher nicht besseres gesehen rate jedem zum kauf der sich ein home studio bauen will sei es für musik oder streaming oder nur zum unterhalten mit dem mikro dieser arm ist gut für alle mikros die ich hatte
5,Das Produkt kam wie gewohnt schnell und zuverlässig an. Geschützt verpackt merkt man beim Auspacken schon die Qualität des Produktes. Montage und Einstellung sind kinderleicht. Genau das richtige für mein Setup. Kann dieses Produkt jedem empfehlen.
5,Nutze den Arm beim Livestreaming und wollte etwas hübscheres als den Standardarm PS1A von Rode. Dieser hier von BLUE sieht in der Cam einfach elegant aus die Kabelführung ist super und der Arm selbst macht einen sehr robusten Eindruck. Mittels 3 Kunststoffschrauben kann man die Stärke/Stabilität einstellen. Bei mir werden Problemlos die schweren Mikrofone Rode Procaster und Sure SM7B gehalten.
5,This stand is so well made and perfect for a home/podcast/radio studio!It has a tension adjustment screw to help counterweight any microphone you put on the end of it. Extremely easy to manoeuvre and adjust.I had it unboxed and setup on my desk with a mic within 5minutes of receiving it
5,Muy buena calidad y diseño es robusto y muy sencillo de colocar buen soporte de sujeción. Es el segundo que compro esta vez para regalar
1,all plastic and impossible to keep fix position !
5,Blue Compass microphone stand true value and quality for money and so much better than my last tabletop stand.  5 out of 5.  Not the cheapest but certainly the best designed for the money.
5,Ein wenig teuer für einen Mikrofonarm in meinen augen (fast so teuer wie das Mikrofon) aber dafür ist er auch extrem gut. Variabler Widerstand viele einstellungsmöglichkeiten und extrem robust
5,Après avoir utilisé des bras type architecte celui-ci est vraiment remarquable tant par sa qualité de fabrication que par l'intelligence de sa conception.
5,rien à dire c’est parfait
5,Bras Blue Compass / Qualité Professionnelle !!!Prix justifié
4,takes time to get the right for lighter micscosts a lot for what it is
5,Produit de très bonne qualité comparé au RODE PSA1 on observe clairement une différence de qualité (bien que ce dernier soit très bien l'ayant bien testé auparavant). Plus solide on a pas l'air d'avoir un produit relativement fragile entre les mains.Certes plus lourd mais assez maniable nécessite un bon bureau solide tout de même silencieux qui plus est.
3,Non tiene la posizione desiderata tende alzarsi da solo anche aggiustando la vite in basso...lo stesso problema. Per me è sconsigliato! Se avete da mettere il microfono in alto con angolo 90* ok ma se volete avvicinarlo alla boca magari stirando un po verso di voi-nulla da fare ritornerà alla posizione di prima.
5,Tough Product
5,The design of this product is miles ahead of anything else in the same category. Very please with the practical usage
5,…en tods los sentidos para mi Yeti X
5,it dose what it should do
5,Super enfin un support solide qui ne se dérègle pas. Très content
1,...ich habe nur ein leichtes Mikrophone. Jetzt habe ich das Problem das die Gelenke sich nicht einstellen lassen. Die Feder intern ist so stark das diese nicht in der gewünschten Richtung bleibt. Egal ob ich die Stellschraube unten locker stelle oder fest wie möglich die Gelnkstopper zu ziehe. Es hält einfach nicht.Ansonsten ist die Verarbeitung gut und sieht alles Robust aus. Kabelkanal ist gut und Halterung an dem Schreibtisch auch.Leider nur wegen dem nicht einstellbaren Schwenkungen total unbrauchbar....Edit: Gelenk ist komplett auseinander gebröselt. Nach fest kommt ab. Leider...
1,Ein Teil des Arms ist durch den Druck der Feder immer wieder nach oben gegangen. Auch bei maximalem Kraftaufwand an der Klemme war das Problem nicht zu lösen. Die Klemme ist dann sogar noch gebrochen obwohl nur mit den Fingern angezogen. Absolut unbefriedigend und ging daher wieder zurück. Habe dann den Elgato Wave Mic Arm gekauft und der funktioniert einwandfrei.
5,As expected great arm
5,Aussitôt acheté aussitôt adopté. Ce bras est à la fois très élégant et très pratique.Son cache câble est très pratique les articulations du bras sont de qualités mais ce bras est fait pour mettre un micro pointant vers le bas. Il n'est pas possible de le faire tenir debout sinon votre bras remonte trop haut et vous n'êtes plus en face de celui-ci.Bon achat je regrette pas.
3,Acheté et installé depuis peu j'ai aperçu un problème sur la deuxième partie du brasQui remontait tout seul même en vissant très fort aucun moyen de le faire tenir comme on le souhaite.Peut t'être avec le temps le problème se réglera mais pour l'instant c'est un problème.Sinon le design est à la hauteur la qualité également mais sont problème casse tout sont charme et sont utilité.Vu le prix de l'article je suis déçus.
5,ich finde es super sehr gute Qualität ich bin voll zufrieden und danke an Amazon Lieferung ging schnellempfehlungswert auf jedenfalls bessere Mikrofon arm bekommt ihr
3,Nicht sehr flexibel dazu sind die Schrauben wirklich extrem schwergängig. Dachte beim original zum blue yeti wäre es perfekt dem ist leider nicht so.
5,Stabil und man hört die Geräusche vom Tisch (Mouse etc.) nicht mehr ! Mehr Platz auf dem Tisch
5,Sans doute le meilleur il est cher mais ça le vaut
5,Tried a few arms this one holds my mic steady and repsonds well when I reposition it and unlike other arms the mic does not drift (moved on its own)
2,Der Mikrofonarm sah beim ersten Eindruck gut aus.Allerdings fing es an das der Arm mit den Federn nicht gerade benutzerfreundlich ist und macht was er will.Dann passte das Kabel nicht mehr an mein SM7B mit diesem Arm!
5,Top
5,Habe die Halterung für mein Blue-Yeti Mikrofon gekauft. Sehr wertig und stabil. In ein paar Sekunden an den Tisch geklemmt und angepasst. Klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,Excellent product well worth the extra money over a rode psa1 and the design is fantastic
4,It’s okay but the friction screws don’t provide any feedback so longevity might be an issue.
1,Lo tengo con un BLUE YETI y su araña oficial todo de la misma marca BLUE y qué queréis que os diga esperaba mucho más de este brazo he esperado unos meses para hacer la review pero es que no me termina de convencer ha probado a ajustar el muelle que tiene con el tornillo de abajo y nada no me parece que funcione como un reloj suizo como decían por ahí arriba ni nada parecido....Me parece CARO y MALO sobretodo la relación calidad - precio es un CUADRO. No lo recomendaría ahora porque ya lo tengo hace bastante y me da pereza pero si tuviera que comprar uno por primera vez probaría otro primero :SNo me resulta muy cómodo para hacer stream en Twitch que es para lo que más lo uso...
5,I'm absolutely satisfied with the product. High quality materials cable management is perfect adjustable friction hinges for each of the pivot points and If by any chance you have problem with the fine tuning you can always tweak tension screw that is placed inside the base of the Compass.
5,Teuer aber schick und richtig gut. Kein Gewackel daubere Bewegung. Top.
5,Hyper solide le câble management au top.Par contre il réside un peu trop à mon goût pour la maniabilité heureusement que mon micro est lourd.
2,I just couldn’t get this to stay in place after tightening always springs back a few inches. Also wanted to mount behind my monitor so the mic would come over my head not possible.  Not that impressed so have returned it.
5,Nach vier Wochen Nutzung sehr zufrieden! Kann den Mikrofonarm empfehlen.
5,Sehr stabil
5,J’adore il est vraiment très robuste.
5,this is an excellent mic boom arm  works very well
1,It is a highly impractical design.Too much work to adjust it.Better go for Rode PSA1
3,It's really hard to position and even then it dips a bit but other than that it's great.
1,I received a used product even tho I ordered "New". The packaging inside was ripped open there was a line of blue markers at the bottom and the screws to adjust the mics positioning were on so tight i tried to loosen them with pliers but even those did not get the job done lol.
5,Vraiment le top du top !!! Cher mais tellement efficace je recommande a 100%
1,HelloMalgré tous les avis allant dans le même sens que le mien j'ai pris le risque.J'ai en ma possession un Shure MV7 j'ai vendu mon RODE PSA1 pour prendre ce bras articulé que je trouvais plus esthétique mais malheureusement grosse déception.Comme beaucoup il m'a été impossible malgré tous les réglages de régler le bras pour que le micro soit devant ma bouche. Le micro remontait peu importe à quel point je serrais.Je ne recommande évidemment donc pas ce micro qui ne semble finalement adapté que pour le poids monstrueux du Blue Yeti.Passez votre tour si vous avez un autre micro le PSA1 est une référence incontournable et parfaite même si moins esthétique.
5,Amazing build quality. And much prefer it to rode's offering even though this is more.Can't ask for a better arm.
1,Come prodotto è molto figo peccato che ci sia l ingranaggio centrale difettoso per via di questo mal funzionamento non posso regolare la posizione in cui mettere il microfono.
5,très bon produit cependant attention si le micro trop lègé le bras ne va pas se régler correctement
1,No not buyThere are two major design flaws with this boom arm.1. The adjustable tensioner is ether on or very on there is no soft adjustment so your mic catapults up all the time. the only way to stop this happening is tighten the arm pivot screw ridiculously tight.2. If your desk it not perfectly level then the boom arm will swing out to the lowest side. This is because there is no lock screw on the swivel base to hold the arm in place.
4,Bonne qualité  seul bémol il faut visser fort les articulation pour que cela ne bouge pas.
5,Lo uso con el SM7B de Shure va muy bien has de vigilar que la mesa esté recta se que es una tonería pero creeme yo le puse una segunda pata a la mesa y ahora no se mueve el micro hacia un lado! enserio es útil!
2,Después de montarlo sinceramente los frenos por llamarlo de alguna manera los fijadores que se tienen que apretar llegando hacer tanta fuerza que hasta daño te puedes hacer sin llegar a fijar realmente las articulaciones por el precio que tiene me lo esperaba 100 veces mejor ... por eso le pongo dos estrellas.
4,ras
1,Designed by Blue themselves and yet this arm can not even handle the weight of the Yeti properly; did you know that Blue also make the Yeti so this is an embarrassing problem for them. It's large cumbersome and in my opinion (obviously) it's ugly to look at. The tension system doesn't work properly which links back to why it can not hold the weight of the Yeti. When you can buy third-party/aftermarket arms for like £10 that do the job BETTER save your money and buy one of them; I'd recommend https://www.amazon.co.uk/Neewer-Adjustable-Microphone-Suspension-Broadcasting/dp/B00DY1F2CS/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=mic+boom+arm&qid=1553648199&s=gateway&sr=8-7 -- I owned this before the Compass Premium and had no problems then and going back to it I'm annoyed that I wasted my money on the Compass arm.**Purchased on August 20th 2018**
1,Gewinde für Micro defekt zurück gesandt Ersatzlieferung erhalten Arretierung für Micro funktioniert leider nicht. Wieder zurück gesandt. Schade.
1,le bras descend sans arrêt tout seul même en serrant le vis de réglage dans l'embase de celui ci  le micro se retrouve a toucher le bureau après quelques seconde  c'est très mauvais pour un produit a ce prix  il aura tenu seulement 3 mois avant d'avoir ce défaut
5,This boom arm looks so nice and feels like really quality. The adjustment knuckles are plastic which is a bit of a shame but other than that this is a real nice piece of kit!
1,nulle à chier avec un micro léger le support ne tient pas une position exacte c'est fait pour les micros lourds.
5,Nur für Mikrofone dir etwas mehr wiegen.
1,Received a defective product and the return policy doesn't allow me to proceed with return or replacement. Kindly help with resolving the issue.
2,If your intention is to have this mic boom in any other position but above you with the mic upside down STAY CLEAR. The tensioners on each joint together with the bottom phillips screw wont be enough to keep this damn thing in place. It does have a solid build its very silent and you can easily cable manage using the grove but my cheap 15€ mic boom does a better job for what I needed.
5,Didn't keep sent back I purchased wrong one
1,I bought this item for my Blue Yeti when I opened it something didn't seem right from the off I tried to put it together but it looked like it had been used previously I clamped the table mount to the table and put arm on to the clamp at which point the front of the arm completely collapsed and fell to the floor at this point I didn't have my mic on if I had it would have smashed on to the floor. now if this is a previously used one and returned this has clearly not been checked and just sent out to me. would not recommend this product.
1,J'avais grand espoir à la réception du produit en question. Le déballage se passe sans problème au moment du réglage le pas de vis de serrage du bras articulé en son milieu nous reste dans la main et impossible de le remettre! Il semble qu'il soit cassé tout bonnement. Nous sommes réellement déçu du problème rencontré même si le matériaux principal est de bonne facture les pas de vis de serrages sont en plastique de piètre qualité.Venons de prendre contact avec le vendeur pour un retour .....Reviendrai pour ajouter au présent message le contenu du feedback avec le vendeur.
1,Bello da vedere sembra efficiente ma fa schifo.Peggior acquisto mai fatto in vita mia.Basta guardare il punteggio delle recensioni per capire quante persone si siano trovate male con questo prodotto.Perché fa schifo?Perché è difficile da montare non sta mai fermo e non prende assolutamente le posizioni che vuoi.E' difficile anche rimetterlo nella scatola visto che lo sto rendendo immediatamente.E questa povertà di prodotto costa pure tantissimo.Ho comprato subito questo articolo perché ho pensato: "se costa di più sarà di un'ottima qualità".Mi sbagliavo.Questi si fanno pagare molto il marchio ma di qualità non ne sanno un granché.Molto meglio un rode psa1 o il Master Mount Elgato
5,He probado otros soportes pero directamente os digo que este es el mejor sin más. Sencillo con un diseño minimalista pero totalmente práctico y funcional. Sin ningíun tipo de duda este es el mejor soporte que puedes comprar. Cierto es que vale un dinero importante pero no dudéis que es el mejor que podéis encontrar.
5,The frame feels really good quality metal and it also looks highly professional.Would definitely recommend to go with the blue yeti pro as the colours match well.
5,besser geht's  nicht
5,ich empfehlen würde.
5,Really pleased with it
1,Hatte mich sehr auf Blue Microphones Radius III  gefreut leider war es nicht möglich die Arme in die gewünschte Stellung fest zu justieren. Obwohl ich das Microfon noch nicht mal befestigte sanken die Greifarme wieder zusammen. Man kann laut Handbuch am unteren Teil der Halterung zwar mit einer Schraube den inneren Seilzug lösen bzw. feststellen aber egal was man da unten drehte der Arm fällt immer wieder zusammen. Halterung zurückgeschickt.
1,Not worth teh money at all. The arm looks string and robust but the tightening of the joint does not work so it will keep moving - terrible if you have to make adjustments
1,tried to ajust the middle joint and it didnt stay stay in the correct position then i didn it up tighter and it broke making it so the screw had it went limp and i am yet to fix it
5,Tres bon bras bonne qualité
5,Buenísimo me encanta. Tenía uno de esos baratos y se nota la diferencia de forma bestial con este brazo de Blue. Perfecto para usar con el micrófono Blue Yeti. Vale lo que cuesta.
1,What a disappointment. As I opened the  product from the packaging the item was clearly set at the wrong tension as the product twisted the wrong way and show marks it was broke. I have attempted a 00 different types of tension but the mic would never stay still. This is truly disappointing as the mic I am using is the blue yeti mic!!!! So disappointing.
1,Dieses Produkt taugt nichts. Überteuerter Mist.Die Feststellschrauben an den Gelenken haben nicht genug Kraft um den Arm zu fixieren.Die ausgeübte Kraft der Federn ist viel zu groß der Arm weicht ständig aus seiner Soll-Positionund läßt sich nicht bequem verstellen. Für >100 EUR ist dies überteuerter Mist.Geht sofort zurück. Bin sehr enttäuscht.
1,This is too stiff to use it's impossible to get it to stay in the place you want.  The internal spring is too tough and you try and vary the strength with the screw provided inside but that makes no difference.Poor design don't waste your money on this.
4,Excelente producto  pero para mi excesivamente caro .
5,Die Federn sind für meinen Geschmack zu stark aber da gewöhnt man sich dran.
1,The arm is made of sturdy material and looks good.However the tension inside the arm makes it impossible for it to be positioned in the required manner.  The small adjustment Phillips screw in the base of the arm didn’t seem to make any difference to the situation despite many attempts. Not sure that I will be able to use this. A waste of money.
5,Le meilleur bras pour microphone rien d’autre a rajouter. Acheter le bras Blue Compass c’est une valeur sur !
5,Brilliant and perfect for the job. High cost but absolutely worth it
2,Viele kleine Details die aus Plastik sind und schnell kaputt gehen! Nicht zu empfehlen für das Shure SM7B! Finde den Rode Gelenkarm viel besser
5,gran brazo para micro blue  es increible la calidad del producto  se puede abrir totalmente y en espacios pequeños se recoge muy bien  una buena inversion para los amantes de streaming
5,As expected
5,Vraiment un beau produit je le recommande.
5,This arm is perfect for Yeti mics
1,The Compass is a hefty boom arm. However it arrived broken with the central joint cracked wide open and no way of properly manipulating the arm. Complete waste of money from a company that I am rapidly realising is all about style over substance. Not impressed.
5,es un poco caro pero sinceramente merece la pena lo recomiendo 100x100  una base firme y que se adapta muy facilmente la recomiendo
5,good
1,Me esperaba mejor calidad y mejor funcionalidad. Esta demasiado duro como para maniobrar bien y conseguir diferentes posturas.
1,Complete waste of time. The fact that you need thumbscrews already tells you that the spring mechanism is a failure. Cannot support any position and lifts the mic up randomly. Black grease is on the joints which gets everywhere and smells terrible. Can’t even fit it back in the box it came with.
5,EXCELLENT PRODUIT - TRES SATISFAIT
1,The 'screws' to adjust this stand don't work no matter how tight you screw them. It's a total pain in the ass to try to set up. I'm having to use it upside down just waiting for the whole thing to collapse. Definitely do not recommend.
5,Un brazo muy firme ideal para micros de peso como el Yeti para el que está construido. Además aguanta cualquier otro micro. Bonito buen diseño y buenos materiales. Recomendado.
5,Great
1,Die Federn sind tatsächlich für Bodybuilder gemacht ich hab keine Chance das Teil irgendwie sinnvoll einzustellen. Was sehr schade ist denn das schlichte elegante Design gefällt mir wirklich sehr gut.Geht also retour...
1,Very disappointed with the product..
5,Best boom arm ever.
1,I put a Rode Procaster on the end and the arm literally can't support the weight it keeps sinking despite the screws being locked tight.
5,Worth it
1,Je l'ai utiliser pendant 1 semaine. Ce bras est impossible à régler je pense fortement qu'il est adapté à leur micros qui sont assez lourd. Après une semaine à serrer sans forcé il c'est détruit lui même même eu peur que mon micro prenne avec la chut.. Bref J'ai mit plus de 100€ dans un produit de mauvais qualité JUSTE POUR LA MARQUE. Go chez un concurrent.
1,trattasi di un supporto del tutto inutile e costosissimo acquistato per sorreggere un microfono Sennheiser 441 del peso di 450 grammi (viene assicurata la portata di in chilo) si è immediatamente piegato non sorregge neppure il suo stesso peso; assolutamente da da evitare
1,Malísimo producto . No me imaginaba que por el precio fuese tan nefasto. Imposible fijar los ángulos . Se parten las llaves de plástico . Al final con cinta americana. El brazo tiende a estar recto y es imposible fijar los ángulos. Es carísimo para la pésima calidad . El producto más nefasto comprado en Armazón.
5,Es muy bonito ... me gusta
1,Produit incomplet. Réglage du bras impossible. On le plis et il remonte tout seul alors que les serrage est à fond
1,le bras n'arrête pas de remonter même avec un micro lourd.
1,Je suis très déçue de ce produit j'ai acheté un micro fait pour ça et la 2 ème partie de bras remonte tous seul et aussi il recule en arrière
1,Bras qui a l'apparence robuste et agréable mais quand on veut bloquer le deuxième morceau de bras même la vis serrez a fond le bras remonte tous seul ...
1,102€ et le produit se casse à la première utilisation...
1,I got a Blue Yeti. So obviously I thought this arm would work.It looks good and cable management is a big plus (it hides the cables).It "kind of works" but unfortunately even if I tighten the arm screws as much as I can without breaking it it's still extending itself.I wonder if I got an used one even though I never order used ones.Sorry but I cannot recommend this product if it's just going to continuously extend my mic over my headwhen I want it in front of my mouth.Truly a shame considering the big investment which just turns out to be a faulty product that is "supposed" to work with Blue Yeti.
2,Right from the beginning the arm would not stay exactly where I wanted it to but I decided to live with it constantly adjusting it as it would drift out of position. I had to keep tightening the middle joint until it eventually failed on me after about 8 months. The middle joint has a plastic fastener to a metal bolt seems from all of the tightening the plastic has worn down and broke. if joints were metal it most likely would not have happened. Odd design to have the arm that carries the wire to be metal and the tightening joints plastic.
1,Joints in plastic and poor overall engineering and quality plus it won’t fit 99% of mic’s
4,The stand looks great and feels good to move around.
5,Very gd quality. Design is beautiful. Please read the installation booklet when you install. You need to add in the microphone and uses it’s weight to make the angle lower. If not it will be higher and you will think it is a design flaw. Take note.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Le bras Blue compass est d’une qualité sans pareil rigide un des plus beau bras pour micro qui existe grand et surtout silencieux.
5,Always went with cheap one that broke down and where bad since the start.This is the kind of thing I wish I would have bought earlier in my life.

1,I've had this unit for 2 months and it has already broken I saw others with these same issues but I bought this anyway because I like the way it looked. It's almost impossible to position correctly during my meetings and all locking connections are plastic. I've reached out to blue mic for warranty and have heard nothing back.Go for quality over looks buy the RODE arm
1,I bought this product because of its sturdiness and great reviews. Unfortunately when I did buy it I left it unopened and lost my window for returns and now am stuck with a long metal stick that doesn't bend properly and stay in place when a mic is attached. Very disappointed if it just worked I would have given top review as it is made from good materials and hypothetically could be very good.. if it worked
2,Bought this mic stand with the thought for the price it would be worth it but since I received this the center elbow of the arm never really tightened that well and would always slowly rise. Very frustrating always having to try to find that sweet spot. Today while trying to adjust slightly I heard a click and the center elbow tension suddenly released and broke. They don't make it where you can use tools around the house to fix too. Also very frustrating.
5,bonne qualite
5,Works great with mike
2,Unless you’re using a Yeti which is a 3.5 lb mic you’ll struggle to use this boom arm.  The spring tension is very stiff and not adjustable enough to use with a Shure MV7 or similar lighter microphone.  Look elsewhere.
5,Ordered this one to be able to use my blue yeti mic in my studio. It holds nice and tight the yeti and does not collapse.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My rode podmic is compatible and its fit great but.......
1,Spring completely gave up after a few weeks of light use... That coupled with the fact that it is basically the most expensive option for a boom arm left me quite sour. I have since returned it... and unfortunately wound up with another one in the Yeticaster package...No problems with the new one yet but I did opt for the extended warranty coverage in anticipation of it failing again... This time I have tightened the screws at the joints to maximum to try and take some pressure off the spring which makes it much more difficult to adjust but should theoretically keep it from breaking again.
1,L purchase
5,I've been using this now for 5 months its great just make sure you have the right mic for it do your research YouTube is your best friend
1,This product did not bend I bought it for my setup so I can stream but the arm did not bend I regret buying this and have returned it today I’m very unhappy with this Buy 😡❌
5,This arm was so expensive. It actually cost more than my mic I use. However this thing is dripping with quality. I highly recommend. It's strong has strong connections and looks hecking cool.
5,I have the Samsson G Track Pro and this boom arm is able to support the weight of the mic and shockmount which is great
5,Fantastic quality product. I would buy this again for sure.
2,Costs too much doesn't stay where you put it and the plastic nobs are flimsy
2,Product was great until recently when the swivel arm mechanism broke. It was never perfectly tight and needed constant tightening which is fine but then suddenly broke and can no longer be tightened. The quality of the materials for an arm at this price point is disappointing. I imagine it can be fixed but no idea what that process will look like. Terribly disappointed.
1,The arm looks great but it doesn't hold any position except straight. As you tighten the screws it sounds like it is going to break and you can see it going back to a straight position.

5,With the money of you have the extra cash and want a clean looking arm
5,like it well worth the money
2,This boom arm seemed to have everything I wanted. But appearances and reality are very different. I attached my Shure SM7B to it and the arm wouldn't hold it up. I tightened the connectors but nothing really changed. There were a couple of spots within the arm's range where it did hold the mic up but over time it sagged. Eventually I tightened it so much that the tightening knob just came right off. I returned this arm and bought one from Rode at the same price point. It works brilliantly at every millimeter in its entire range of motion and never sags. Save yourself time and frustration and avoid this product.
2,i literally cant make the arm stay at an angle without it shooting up without almsot breaking the knob. my mic is heavy enough but i genuinly had to add a weight to it and it ruins the "sleek" look
1,Bad quality not working with HyperX QuadCast the arm was BROKEN and always going up.Thanks to amazon to give my money back I ll buy a RODE PSA1.
5,Holding my Blue Yeti mic with no problems at all. Looks slick and holds the wire too.Install was as easy as operating a clamp. Slide the arm in and adjust to where you want the mic.Great product very good quality.
1,Arm had never stayed still at 45 degres. It would always go up by itself even if I would screw the elbow mechanism tensr’ion. It ended up breaking and now as per the photo It cannot use it anymore. Total waste of money and over priced for the quality. Do not buy!
5,Amazing quality and quick shipping - sturdy and genuine product.
4,High quality fonish and materials but as has been commented on elsewhere if you have anything other than a very heavy microphone the tension in the arm will make it very difficult to use. My Blue Yeti Nano is right on the borderline of being too light to effectively use the mic arm. Even with adjusting the tension to the minimum it's always just on the edge of moving upwards just when you don't want it to. Such a shame because it looks beautiful and is made of quality materials.
2,I have a blue yeti x and followed the instructions to a 't' including using the screw at the bottom of the base to adjust tension for weight. But even that wasn't enough to get this mic stand to behave in a way that was useful at all. In fact the only time it behaved as it should I had used the base stand that came with the mic as added weight on the mic and that required clever set up in itself.Much like an eager lover this stand will rise to attention regardless of position placed.I thought it couldn't be as bad as the comments suggested here or on YouTube. I was incorrect.Good luck to anyone who chances it for themselves.
3,The blue yeti is a heavy mic so i was not taking a chance and got the blue yeti mount arm. Its great it really is however the first elbow never works. Doesnt matter how tight or where you have it when setting it just doesn't work well. The arm is also fairly short with only 1 real elbow leaving it hard to place on a desk setup.
4,Mount looks amazing but I guess the nano isn't Heavey enough you can't freely adjust. Maybe it's just too new but I only get a few positions. Also a but expensive for what you get
5,Have to be careful when setting up highly recommended watching the setup video first. It has its own sorta twist to it
5,Tried some of the Neweer with the Blue Yeti mic... They were always too weak to hold the mic. This thing is a beast it's so easy to set up hide the cable and is impressively strong. Definitely recommended
1,Beaucoup trop de tension et impossible de l'ajuster correctement.
1,i have a blue yeti and can not get the arm to stay where i want it. I spent 150 to buy this not worth it do not buy it bad.
2,Don’t buy this if your mic is lighter than like 7 pounds IMO. Actually I don’t know if thats an excat weight but if you got a light microphone get the Rode mic arm
2,I use this arm with the blue yeti you know the mic that this arm is meant for. It doesn't sit still it always returns to the default position. Incredibly frustrating. I have torqued the stabilizing fingers screws all the way in and beyond using a wrench to really tighten it down beyond what it is intended and still it doesn't sit properly. The base joint and the top joint work as intended the issue is with the middle joint.Heed the reviews everyone says the same thing and this is NOT a good product.
5,It's a great boom arm and does what it needs to do. I have a Yeti mic and it works perfectly with this. The tension is pretty high on this which is probably to account for the heftiness of the Blue Yeti mic. I had to adjust the tension pretty tightly to get it to move and stay where I wanted it.
2,Don’t buy this if your mic is lighter than like 7 pounds IMO. Actually I don’t know if thats an excat weight but if you got a light microphone get the Rode mic arm
1,I'm really not sure why this mic stand is rated so high. This shows the lack of alternatives on the market. My 1st one broke (screws are plastic) then the 2nd one just broke again. I have a Shure SM7B mic and it won't hold it properly. I tightened the scree under the base but still not holding it 80% extended.  It has to sit on my desk.This is a mediocre product at best. It's too bad because it looks great but does a poor job. Not worth the money.
1,Turned knob once and it exploded. Only glued on. Huge waste of money.
4,First off if you aren’t using a mic as heavy as the Blue Yeti or Shure SM7b DO NOT BUY THIS! As it is not built for those mics and will not stay in the position you desireIf you do have a heavier microphone (in my case Shure SM7b) this thing while still difficult to keep in certain positions is made of very high quality materials for a boom. It stays on the table securely with zero concerns and even manages the wires in the top of the boom.My complaints are the tension and the price would be perfect for $100.
4,I use it with a Shure PGA181 which isn't a featherweight by any means but isn't as heavy as a Yeti. Zip-tied a sway bar drop block (lol) to it in order to have it stay in place. Works great now but out of the box that spring tension adjuster seriously needs a redesign.
1,Broke first month in
1,this piece of junk fell apart after a month
4,Its good but lord I paid more for the boom arm then I did the Blue Yeti mic. Anyways its good will last for years probably a lifetime.
1,I used this for my blue yeti for about 2 months and I loved it. It worked perfectly I could always adjust it to where I wanted it and it just worked how it was supposed to.That's was until it broke. I was gaming one day and realized it was higher than it usually sits (which it never did before) so naturally I tightened it. Well the inside of the tightening mechanism stripped and snapped off so now the arm won't tighten at all and just stands straight up. Can't use it at all now. I would understand if this happened a year or so down the line or if I was constantly changing it but I had left it in the same spot with the same adjustments since I got it.
5,After 4 months of light use. The head bracket kept coming loose. After having to tighten it multiple times a day the adjustment knob (which is plastic) stripped off the bolt inside. I glued it back on and it seemed to fix the problem for a few days; until the actual plastic mount that connects to the Mic itself broke off randomly. The product itself is great! I just wish they made the whole thing metal. Not just the arm itself; that would have prevented this incident and saved me another $130 to replace it
5,Very impressed with this purchase. The item arrived earlier than expected. Easy to assemble sturdy stand for my sons microphone. Great quality for a great price :)
5,It's sturdy good quality. Just mind to unscrew the bottom bolt so you can adjust it no instructions about it on the manual
5,can be a little difficult to get it to sit right but does it’s job much worth having to keep mic out of the way
5,Works a treat with my Razer Siren Elite. It's very sturdy and swings well.
5,Got this Blue Compass 989000517 Premium Microphone Boom Arm today and am supa impressed with its strength build quality and over all function. the extra nice thing on this is the cable management channel built into the neck keeping your cables off the floor or hanging loose so you don't bend you cables USB/Pins. Highly recommended.
5,Perfect for my set up and attached well to my desk. Sturdy product
1,If you use any other mics (hyperx QuadCast etc) except the Blue mic this might not work as it will just lift your mic to the sky. The construction is very cheap - it looks nice but the joins are plastic and will wear. I regret this purchase so much.
5,For those who bend this arm you are officially the strongest thing on the planet.. and also you own a microphone arm. It is a very good arm came quicker than expected and the box was good fire fuel. 10/10
5,good
1,I bought this for a Yeti X Pro microphone which is quite heavy (1.14 lbs) and the thing would NEVER STAY PUT. The arm always fully extent back straight up. I loosened the tension screw as much as possible and tightened the friction disks as much as humanly possible. And again it would NEVER stay bent. And YES I DID HAVE THE MICROPHONE ATTACHED.Wasted my time energy patience and money.
1,It really doesn't hold your mic... it keeps going up and up and its impossible to adjust with my SHURE MV7.Keep looking guys trust the reviews
5,This works perfectly for me and the SM7B. After playing with tension knobs I can pretty much move the arm however I want without issue. Very happy with this and really like how you can run the mic cable through the arm for a clean look.
3,It more was complicated than expected - had to disassemble and put it back together to get it to fit onto my desk took quite awhile to assemble
2,The adjustments for this boom arm are horrible.The friction plate in the middle hinge pulled itself out of the knob trying to tighten it in the correct position.I really miss my O.C. White Podcast Pro by Accu-Lite Mic Boom. But I needed a new tube style arm for a USB C mic.  The Blue Compass does not even compare...
5,Great product highly recommend if you have the budget to spend it on this arm. It’s sturdy and moves very fluidly when needed
4,After reading the reviews I decided to risk it.  It is sturdy and moves silently.  The resistance is really high and I used a weight to keep it in place or it would rise up - just like so many others stated but when my shock mount showed up - it was perfect - I must have hit the sweet spot for weight.
1,Cant not pose into a usable position Thumbscrews can never lock down position........ NEVER do you understand me? NEVER no matter what.  Un huh sorry not even likely. This would be a main goal of thumb screws and this does not accomplish it.
1,I have a blue yeti mic so presumably a blue yeti boom arm would be a perfect match right? This thing is wound way to tight internally. It says in the guide that the middle joint should be at a 90 degree angle. I've loosened the tension screw at the base to the point the whole screw came out and this thing still keeps snapping back into a straight line. Even with the mic attached.
1,This think is driving me crazy because it refuses to stay in place. I have tightened as much as I can but it just springs back to where it wants to go. I have a Blue which is what this product is supposed to be for but it I am likely sending this thing back. For such a high price I expected something that meets the basic requirement of staying stationary - which it should do according to the description and pictures.
5,I use it with my RODE  PODMIC. It works awesome no more dropping boom. internal tension only had to be tweaked a little.
4,Honestly I buy it because it had the cleanest design use it with my HyperX QuadCast some position are hard to set since the microphone seem lighter than Blue Yeti one I'll probably try to losen the spring again or found a way to add some more weight.Seem good quality clean design expensive for Blue Yeti microphone primarily.
5,Blue's Boom Arm is one the nicest looking boom arms on the market as of right now and it's made out of quality materials unlike the more inexpensive options. Since this is a fair review of the product I do just want to put a disclaimer that this boom arm isn't for everyone or the best option for every mic setup. This arm is mainly for heavier mics and worked really well for my Blue Yeti X.Pros:-Standard sturdy desk mount (clamp)-Free almost frictionless design for the swing motion of the arm.-Has little diagrams on the arm itself in a form of a sticker for basic info-Matte black paint job-Feels like they put some premium materials into it-Tension is highly adjustable.-Cable management routing systemCons:-The cable routing system won't fit thick cables as it seems very narrow.-Expensive-The value for this mic is only achieved for a certain amount of microphones-Branding on the arm. (Don't mind it but I know some people do)
5,Fait ce qu'il doit.. tenir le micro!
3,The Blue Compass arm started out very good. But after 6 months of use the middle connection area where one of the tension knobs are completely broke while tightening. This is an issue of over tightening but I wouldn't have thought I would have been able to push it that far before it would have stopped me from trying. This is a pretty big design flaw in my opinion. And I wasn't using any kind of tools to assist in tightening. This was all with my own hands. I am very disappointed this happened. This was the second microphone arm I had ever purchased (first being from a different brand).Be careful about how much you increase the tension to tighten the arm for your needs.
3,The boom works pretty good adjusting the tension is a bit of a process to get just right but when it is all set it works pretty well. The issue I have with it is that it is bulky I run 4 monitors (work/life 50/50 split) and the boom is always in the way of at least one screen no matter where it is placed. Anyone running a normal setup would be happy with this but I don't think it is a great solution for a multi monitor setup.
5,I really like this boom arm.I had the Neewer( ok for a tiny mic) too expensive for the quality.Rode good it does what one needs heavy mics good.The Blue Compass very sturdy great materials looks professional bettercable management and just perfect.
1,I was looking for an upgrade from my cheap 30$ boom arm and the Blue compass seemed perfect. The design looked great with hidden cable management no pinching the fingers due to the hidden springs and great flexibility.Unfortunately after receiving it I was very disappointed:1) Even on the lowest tension setting the arm does not stay in place. I have the ShureMV7. This might work with heavier mics but does not work with lighter ones.2) The second piece of the arm can only be bent in one direction. The final bendable piece on the arm that connects to the mic adapter has a limited range as well. This can be a problem if you are intending to use the arm coming from the bottom up and having the mic sit upwards on it facing you. In my case this led to the mic not being straight.3) The mic adapter is not movable 360 degrees. Not sure if that was just my arm and I got unlucky or if that’s always the case. Trying to screw the mic on and having it end up in the right position was a nightmare.4) The foundation of the arm sits quite high. So if you are intending to have the arm come from the bottom to your mouth (not from the top) you’ll have to bend the arm quite a bit and even then it might still not be in the right position.Conclusion: If you don’t have a heavy Yeti mic and don’t intend to use the arm as shown in the pictures I do not recommend it. Not worth the money and creates more problems then it solves.
1,I got this boom arm for my blue yeti microphone expecting it to support its weight. But apparently the blue yeti microphone weights too little for this boom arm to work so instead of being pulled down the boom arm goes straight up to the roof like a (you know what). After adjusting the screws in the boom arm as shown in the manual the screw got stuck and the handle you use to maneuver the arms strength fell off.Then I had a fix to this by applying weights on the microphone such as the microphone stand that the mic comes with making it look really ugly. 1 week later the screw inside the boom arm where the handle popped out broke out of it making the boom arm cut in half (kinda).Would I recommend it? no lol
5,love it but a little pricey own three
3,I got it.. haven't had a chance to try it.. I'm missing parts though..
1,For how much this thing cost you think it would be a good product. This thing tension is so tight it wont stay to the way you adjust it too it just goes back to being erect no matter how hard you tighten it. I've loosen the tension to the point the screw fell of and the tension is still way to high. Avoid this thing at all cost. waste of money.
5,Mic: Blue Yeti Pro (OG Black one)Blue Yeti X (newest mic) (this is my daily)Both mounted on a shock mount.As many of the other reviews state the tensioning is super high on this arm. Which is a shame because other wise this feels like its a $200 arm. Crazy smooth and feels solid.Neither of my mics could tension this arm correctly. I loosened the spring tension at the base but that didn't help. Its literally unusable. This is not an exaggeration. Neither of my mics could even remotely bend this arm.If only my mics were a few pounds heavier.....Then I had a big brain moment and purchased leg weights. That come in tiny bags of 2 pounds each. There is plenty on amazon. I purchased a 10 pound set and strapped 1 bag (2pounds) the the arm using xl tip ties.Amazon has a solution for all your problems. Hire me.I actually had to engage the tensioning system at the base of the arm slightly. Now the arm is perfect. It behaves like its floating no matter where I put it it stays.10/10I would still buy this arm again because I have tried the others and this is higher quality material. Also I don't need a XLR socket so I didn't but the gator works. If you need XLR go buy that its double the price but has XLR line in and wont need to screw around with weights.
3,The item is amazing and lacks instructions I had to google around to understand how it works. The only thing is that you need to make sure the mic has a good weight to balance it up. I had the Blue Yeti Nano mic and apparently the weight was not heavy enough so I got the Radius III and it worked well with it. So item mounted including the shock mount is not heavier than 800g then you will have balance issues.
4,This is like the only clamp I could find that was longer than 2.5 inches! It sucks that it's double the price of regular mics just because I have a slightly thicker desk but at least this exists - I almost gave up looking.Also I didn't have any issues with the boom arm going up like ppl said. Just buy a shock mount to add with your mic and it can pull down the arm with enough weight. I use a Fifine K678 microphone.
3,the tension in the middle joint is way to high even at the lowest setting. Unless you have a heavy microphone it will spring up. (mine weighs 386 grams)
4,This boom arm is great for my blue yeti. It works exactly as advertised and is really solid construction. My only qualm is that I wish there was a "storage" setting to collapse the arm when I'm not using it. Everything is internal so there's no springs or anything to accidentally squish your cords. Even works with off brand shock mounts. Really happy with my purchase. It's a bit expensive but considering the expense of the mic itself it's a worthy investment.
1,Garbage. Would not recommend it.
5,EDIT 3/8/21 - updated to 5 starBlue sent me a replacement unit when I raised the support ticket. It came fast and I;m happy with their support. I took a little more time to setup the boom arm this time.  I adjusted the tention looser so I didnt have to tighten the arm joints as hard.  Hoping this helps prevent the plastic parts that I think should be metal from breaking.I think if you set this up with the correct tention from the start you will have better luck than I did.  Its looking good and working well right now!Orginal review: I had as 3 starsI bought a cheaper arm that lasted about a year then I saw this option directly from Blue (I have a blue Yeti) and thought this would be perfect and high quality.  I think the design is great the engineering and materials is poor and if this hasn’t broken for you yet it likely will.I'd save money and look at other options.
4,I just bought this arm 2 weeks ago and it’s pretty good. I’m using the Shure MV7 mounted to the arm. Every time I use the mic it starts to slowly move away from me and go back up to the normal position it was in when purchased. This doesn’t really bother me as it has great built in cable management and if I have it placed in a good spot it doesn’t move at all. Definitely buy this if you have the money it’s worth it 100% although if you have a different mic such as blue yeti or something else you may need to add extra weight to help hold it down into position.
4,Bit of an expensive offering took a little fiddling to get the tension settings just right but now it's all correct its a rather pleasant boom to use.
2,I bought 2 of these and read the reviews online. It said some of the arms are defective and dont work so it will stay stiff and stuck in one position. thats what happend with me completely stuck. waste of time and 2 trips to post office
5,Replaced my RØDE PSA-1 arm that broke after around 5 years of use and a few small features I like compared to it:- Easier to adjust the tension in the 3 hinges- Included cable channel that hides the cable rather than some reusable cable ties that you seeCons:- The clamp isn't as well made as the PSA-1 specifically the padding seems much less thick and more prone to damaging the underside of the desk- Took quite a while to adjust my mic properly on this arm compared to the PSA-1 (I use an SM7BOverall a great option we'll see how long it lasts.
5,Se nota que es muy resistente y se ve muy bien.Sin duda está diseñado para micrófonos pesados y grandes en mi caso particular el micrófono que uso es más bien ligero (Samson Meteor) y tuve que disminuir al mínimo la tensión para lograr que se mantuviera en la posición que necesito e incluso así no pude lograrlo sino hasta que le agregué el peso del filtro pop pero muy apenas y después de múltiples reajustes. Me quedó más cómodo que el soporte de gama baja que tenía antes pero no tanto como hubiera querido.
1,the product just snapped out of the blue when it wasn't even in motion gi was able to put back all the parts but that shouldn't happen on a 100$ boom arm it also won't stay in play yes i have loosend the screw and still doesn't work
