5,This product is really easy to install and the instructions the came with explained everything in a easy to understand way. I've been putting screen protectors on my devices since the first Android phone and This was probably my most favorite. The device is really neat in how it works to put the screen protector on and it's very aesthetically pleasing to press the pressure points and see the screen protector seal onto the screen. I highly recommend this product to people who have difficulty aligning their screen protector. How every I'm not sure if it's elderly friendly so if your elderly you may want to have a younger person install it. Again I highly recommend this product!!
5,I just received and installed this on my iPad Pro and it was fast and easy. The easiest install I have probably done to date. Not sure how well the screen will hold up from wear and tear yet. I does look and feel great.
5,Can‚Äôt find anything to dislike. I like the texture not too rough and not too smooth. My Apple Pencil responds with no problems. This makes using my iPad as a notepad extremely easy and I have enjoyed using it because of this screen protector. Almost zero glare and because of the texture you don‚Äôt notice any smudges or finger prints.
5,The screen feels like paper and it‚Äôs a pleasure to use with the apple pen. It also hides smudges and small scratches better.
5,Easily helps to align it perfectly and evenly.  Good feel.
5,Way better for note taking journaling and drawing. Love it!
5,I have bought a couple different screen protectors for My iPad and this one by far was the easiest to install. No bubbles! It came with all the necessities for installation and more. You wouldn't believe some don't come with tools. I havent needed to replace a screen protector too often since I purchased this iPad so spending $15 is worth it for what you get. Works well with the pen seems to be precise. I write in cursive and it picks up my handwriting more accurately
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I like how easy it was so install the screen! The blue guide will definitely make sure that the screen is in the perfect position. I like the thickness and paperfeel feature is smoother than the last product that I used. So I give it a 10/10
5,Having the template made this application of the screen saver the easiest ever.
5,Only thing I don‚Äôt like is that it does make it a TOLBit more difficult to for the applePencilTo read the screen
4,Maybe I‚Äôm new to the paper texture screen protectors but I definitely didn‚Äôt expect the screen quality to go down that much I think it does excellent in its intended purpose it‚Äôs just not for me and thought I‚Äôd let people know if you‚Äôre not a huge artist this might not be for you like it‚Äôs not for me. Also the install guide is probably the best even spigen doesn‚Äôt have as neat a set up as this
3,I didn‚Äôt like it as much because the whole reason I got a paper feel is for notes and drawing it it feels very weird to write on but other than that it was very easy to install and no air bubbles which I really liked.
5,I loved everything about this screen protector except one thing. You do have to press kinda hard now when tapping or using the Apple Pencil. Nothing super huge but still will take some time to get used too. I was extremely happy with how easy it was to install. I almost didn't believe it was on there at first I kept pressing the thing over and over lol
5,Let's be frank and honest. I followed direction but i still got a stubborn bubble that wouldnt come off. But customer service was amazing they assessed my concerns and even sent a replacement. Now to the actual quality of the protector. It is amazing for writing and sketching. But if you use both the pen and touch screen to get around your iPad it gets tricky. All pen time works perfect but when it comes to using it without the pen it does reduces the touch screen sensitivity maybe I have to adjust it somehow in the settings but have yet to tried that.
5,This screen protector was not only super easy to install but it feels like paper and the glare is non-existent!!
5,Easy to install
5,
5,I use my iPad Pro for various tasks everyday and my biggest issue is greasy fingerprints all over the screen.  Ive tried several screen protectors that are supposed to reduce greasy fingerprints but they really don't seem to work as well as this paper like screen protector.  I found it is an awesome value for the price!
3,The installation frame has small lips on all four sides that are not noticeable but are large enough to cause misalignment. Mine misaligned vertically so the top edge of the protector is on the frame and won't seal to the glass of my iPad.The texture is great and using the Apple Pencil for writing and note-taking is very much improved with this screen protector. It does have a matte finish but doesn't seem to cause any problems with image quality.I hope they can make changes to the installation frame to prevent the misalignment issue.
3,I‚Äôve put on multiple screen protectors on and this one wasn‚Äôt the greatest. Idk if I just did it wrong but there were so many bubbles after pressing on the sticker. I pretty much had to do it manually because I couldn‚Äôt get the bubbles out. One of my corners also didn‚Äôt stay on the screen so it‚Äôs just a bubble forever. Aside from that there is no sticker that comes with it to take off hairs and small things just an alcohol wipe and a dry wipe that I didn‚Äôt even use. Like the feeling of it but probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend especially for one screen protector.
5,Bought this for my iPad Pro and was so glad that there was this product that has BOTH tempered glass and the paper like texture.It was super easy to install the screen protector on the ipad with the plastic applicator that comes with the package it was a little difficult to get some of the air bubbles out but they came out eventually!
2,I am not at all impressed with this screen protector.  Applying it was easy until you lift the plastic form and see the bubbles all over some on the edges will not go out and the one on the corner allowed it to lift. It is very thick and very opaque I have had 3 paper feel screen protectors but none of them distorted images like this does and hinders the Apple Pencil from having equal good contact on the whole screen.  I will be finding a better one as soon as possible.
3,It is indeed nice I love it. But for practical use daily it has worn down my pencils tips in One month currently on about to change onto my 3rd since using the protector. If you‚Äôre a casual drawer it‚Äôs amazing
1,this looked so easy right! NOOOOOO I made sure I ordered the correct size for the new iPad. Watched the video 10 times (really that many times) be for I started to install. followed directions and it was off center by 1/2 inch.  Which means 1/2 of the side of the iPad was not covered.  also there were many bubbles that would not come out. So I contacted there service info and guess what they are in China and left me a thank you message for buying. No help the phone number called is disconnected. It is awful! Doing not buy this product. I am returning it to amazon for refund. Lets see if I get it.  I just want other people to know this is not a good product and do not buy it .  It is a piece of junk!  It does not work. and there is only like 130 buyers for this product.  I should have know with only that many small amount of buyers.  I usually look at the reviews !
2,The sticker used to removed dust only got stuck to the screen and made the screen harder to clean. Had to remove the sticky part off and throw the stickers away. Wasted money on this product. Came with a few small scratches as well.
2,I like the feel of it to draw on but unfortunately it is peeling off in two corners. The pencil won't draw in the areas where it is peeling off so I'm always turning the ipad to be able to draw in an area where the protector is well attached. Looks like this will have been a waste of money since I'll have to replace it.I updated this to two stars because the company replaced the protector for free. However the new one already has bubbles so I'm sure the same thing will happen. I'm bummed although they were very nice about it.
5,I tried multiple iPad screen covers and hated them all until this one. It‚Äôs quick and easy to install and align. I love it.
5,Alignment device was great addition üëç
2,The product cake with a squeegee and it scratched the screen protector.
2,I like the feel of the glass but the application frame does not fit on my iPad Pro A2377 leaving me to have to remove and reposition it leaving large bubbles. Not happy
5,This is perfect. I had no issues with getting it on looks good. Paper feel is nice. Great product.
1,Installation was a nightmare and ultimately failed. I use something similar to this on my phone however it‚Äôs made by a much better known brand. This came with a plastic alignment tray (so far so good) and but actually getting the screen protector to stay on the iPad after peeling proved impossible. There are two plastic film protectors over the glass plate you‚Äôre supposed to peel off one before and one after fitting the protector over the iPad screen. The first film peeled off easily but the second one took was on the wrong side of the protector and sandwiched between it and the iPad screen. It looks like it was put on wrong from the factory. I‚Äôd recommend finding another screen solution.
2,'I really wanted to love this screen protector but I actually hate it. The actual iPad image quality downgrades significantly!! The ‚Äúpaper like‚Äù just gets dirty and dusty for no reason.I‚Äôve installed a LOT of other screen protectors and this one just had a lot of extra steps and still got bubbles which usually with other brands don‚Äôt get them.There are much better and cheaper  options out there.
1,The item that was sent was not like the one that is in the photo. The instructions for application are for a different product in the listing and in the video of the QR code.I essentially wasted this money because it also did not come with an applicator like described.
2,Install is easy and the feel is great but there is an unfortunate fuzzy discoloring issue (photo is what should be a pure white background). There is also a major reduction in contrast which I believe is not completely uncommon for a matte surface. I‚Äôm going to try a more established brand in hopes of finding something with color accuracy and better contrast.
5,Best I ever used
1,The screen protector comes sealed to the ‚Äúalignment help tool‚Äù off quilter and part of the inner screen was curled so it would apply off set and wouldn‚Äôt seal to the screen. If your going to give us a tool for easy alignment actually do your job of setting it up to not be off and unsealable
1,The screen protector made the screen look very cloudy and fuzzy. Hard to focus when the glare of the ‚Äúpaper-like‚Äù screen is just like staring at snow on a tv. There are definitely better options out there
1,Sorry but simply it‚Äôs a garbage. Will return it tomorrow.
1,I feel like I wasted my money‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a constant film on it that will not go away no matter what you clean it with
1,The quality of the screen goes down becomes very fuzzy horrible
4,I have never had a paper-feel protector before o when I got a new iPad I decided to see how different it s vs. the glossy ones.There are pros and cons.Pros- fantastic install kit and instructions. Everything is provided for a flawless install and that is what I got. I had just the day before installed a different brand protector on my wife‚Äôs iPad and its tiny cleaning pad and cleaning cloth plus no squeeze tool to remove air bubbles meant I ruined one of the two protectors. I recommend this kit just because they provide quality tools.- no reflections. This is not ‚Äúanti-glare‚Äù but non-reflective. If you hold this against a light source you won‚Äôt be able to see what‚Äôs on the screen but if there is a lamp above and in front it won‚Äôt cause. Reflection in the screen. Overall I think I prefer this type of ‚Äúmatte‚Äù screen over a glossy one.- nice feel for paper kind-of. See ‚Äúcons‚Äù next.Cons- ‚Äúpaper-feel‚Äù turns out to be subjective. Paper can feel almost as smooth as glass - think coated bond or it can be very rough like charcoal drawing paper or anything in between. This is not a smooth surface. If you run your finger over a paper grocery bag that will give you a good idea of what this feels like. I wish it were smoother.- more mistakes because it takes more pressure. Note the ‚Äús‚Äù in the first sentence? The screen didn‚Äôt sense my press of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù key. I find I have to press harder when writing with fingers than with no or a glossy protector.-feels a bit rough with a stylus. I feel more like I‚Äôm using that charcoal paper than nice bond.Whether you like the feel of this will be subjective. Hopefully I have provided some context to decide if you want to try this.
3,It‚Äôs okay. Easy to install once you watch the video. My problem is the iPad screen (with the screen protector put on) feels quite weird. I prefer the screen feel like glass but instead it feels grainy/paper like. Since it‚Äôs supposed to be tempered glass I thought it was supposed to feel like glass but it doesn‚Äôt. I realize though once I came back on Amazon after the purchase and putting the screen protector on my iPad that the screen protector is supposed to feel like paper. So it is kind of my fault. Still don‚Äôt like the screen protector though.
5,Easy to instal! And this is coming from someone who can‚Äôt put on a screen protector to save a life!If you have bubbles after the installing the screen protector you can try to remove them with the tool they provide if that doesn‚Äôt work give it 2-3 days and the bubbles should disappear as it did to me.Overall great screen screen protector I highly recommend to anyone who wants to takes notes with their IPad!
5,F√°cil de instalar
