5,I picked up this mouse as it was the latest and greatest at the time of this review. Work paid for me to get a desktop setup similar to what I have in the office so I figured I would see what this mouse was all about.There are many that say it is too heavy and will not be comfortable for long sessions at the desk but I do not find that to be the case at all. I really like the form factor of the mouse and do not notice the weight being an issue at all even after 8-10 hours of work a day.The lighting is cool but I have to have the software open in the background. I thought there was some on board memory that would keep my settings but so far I have not found it although I have not spent a lot of time looking for it.The scroll wheel has good feedback when scrolling line by line. There is also a button that unlocks the wheel for an infinite scroll function that lets you spin the wheel once and scroll until it stops. This is great for long web pages or spreadsheets with many rows.The size of the mouse is great too. I have an average sized hand I would say and I have no issues gripping the mouse or reaching any of the buttons. I was looking for something with a little bit more symmetry but the shape is iconic to the brand and has grown on me since I got it out of the box.I have the mouse paired with the new wireless keyboard that Razer has out and am currently waiting for the wireless charging dock to be delivered but that will allow me to easily charge the mouse at lunch and overnight when I am not using it as well as act as a hub that both the mouse and keyboard can pair to. I know that is not directly related to the mouse but it is compatable with it so I felt it was worth the mention.At the end of the day this mouse is a lot like  many of the other flagship gaming mice that I have used from many other manufactures but I really like it and will not be in any hurry to replace it!
4,So my first experience with this mouse wasn't the greatest. The Bluetooth function and the 2.4Ghz dongle didn't work with connecting the mouse to my computer so I had to get a replacement. The replacement works perfectly though so no complaints there and really glad Amazon was so quick to send a replacement for me! Since getting the replacement I have loved using this mouse for productivity and work. The ergo shape feels great and having the 4 way scroll wheel is a game changer for work. I gave this 4 stars though because of a few things. First being the price. $160 is a lot to charge for a mouse but I do realize that other mice in this category are around the same price but I still don't see why. Second is the fact that Razer made an extra wireless puck to go in the bottom of this mouse but they sell it separately along with the wireless dock. I understand selling the dock separately but not the wireless puck; why not just include the puck in this package instead? Otherwise I really enjoy using this mouse but not sure I would recommend it for gaming unless you like a heavier mouse.
4,I've been using an anodised aluminium mouse mat for a couple of years with G502 but the thing has always been making a lot of noise (the same sort of noise as you would get from sliding G502 down on finely polished wooden surface). These teflon feet actually make the thing slide silently.The mouse comes bundled with Razer's new super-ultra-extra-speed-flex cable. The cable is not just a marketing nonsense it indeed has barely noticeable drag.The build quality is spotless. Even the mouse wheel that generally makes Razer products look low-quality has fairly nice feel.About the Synapse software. Right after installation I discovered a bug with using on-the-flight DPI feature (i. e. you hold a button and use the scroll wheel to adjust the DPI). When coupled with free spinning wheel the the DPI keeps increasing even after the wheel has stopped. The bug has been reported but the very fact that I encountered a bug almost immediately after installation is concerning. Apparently the rumors about Razer Synapse are also true. Which is bad. Very bad if that is their attitude.
5,INITIAL IMPRESSIONS :* phenomenal daily driver work casual mmo but not the best for FPS [slippiness of pointer finger]* gorgeous RBG - I could care less if it had it or not but the current gen RBG is tolerable for adults* aesthetically not over the top -  turn the RBG off and would go unnoticed* comfortable* slippery [pointer & middle] grippy [thumb & ring/pinky]* clicky not clacky[Logitech Pro Wireless]* overall it's not a heavy mouse but it's not light either || back heavy [current limitations of Bluetooth enabled mice]*probably the best scroll-wheel on the market Logitech is going to need to catch-up
4,I'm not sure if I need to turn off RGB completely since after having it at 10% brightness it will deplete to nearly 20% in the 2.4g wireless mode. The wireless charger also doesn't charge the mouse completely overnight. I will have to test this perhaps with a fast charger as the mouse itself charges fast when connected to a fast charger.Mouse is great otherwise!
4,Just like the Basilisk mice that came before it it is one of the most comfortable mouse shapes you can find (if you are right handed).  The Logitech like free spinning mouse wheel is great the RGB accents are subtle but beautiful and the buttons are mostly in a good place if you have big hands.  But strangely the option to swap the “sniper” button for different lengths have been removed and the default length isn’t nearly long enough for my thumb to reach.
5,As a true fan of this line of gaming mice and a staple in my daily gaming rotation the Basilisk v3 pro is the new bar raised from a history of quality form function and the pursuit of mouse perfection. This mouse spends more time in my hand than anything else in my entire pathetic life!…and that’s saying a lot for a single middle aged guy with a porn addiction. Just kidding!!! maybe…
1,Great mouse plagued with connectivity issues. After exchanging between several mouses none of the 2.4Ghz dongles worked out of the box. The only option to connect then is bluetooth which is absolutely awful with this mouse. It goes to sleep after about 30 seconds of inactivity and then takes several seconds to wake up. Considerable amount of lag as well over bluetooth. Save yourself half the money and buy the wired version. If you need wireless look elsewhere.
1,El dongle de 2.4 GHz no es reconocido por la computadora simplemente me vino defectuoso. No ofrecen la posibilidad de hacer un reemplazo de producto solo reembolso. Si tan solo el dongle inalámbrico me vino defectuoso. Espero que no sea el caso de otros. Fuera de eso el mouse es un 10/10.
5,I have talked about my love about the ultralight Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse and to be truthful I have not wanted to use a new mouse since I really enjoyed this mouse so much.But I had to try another Razer mouse and this time it's the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro Customizable Wireless Gaming Mouse.And I know there are comparisons to another major brand mouse with a similar price tag and also being known as one of the more expensive gaming mice available in the market.But because it's nearly $160 does it make it an awesome mouse?  Considering the ultralight Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse has already won me over?Let's give it a try!I have been using the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro Customizable Wireless Gaming Mouse for the past month.  And before I go on with my review the other expensive mouse comes with a docking station and costs around $170.  This version without a docking station is nearly $160 but if you want the Mouse Dock Pro that is $230 and if you want a wireless charging puck that is about $180.  So there are pricier options.For those who are not familiar with the Razer Basilisk gaming mouse the gaming mouse is known for its multi-button designit's ergonomic feel and also having 11 programmable butotns which can be mapped through Razer Hypershift.  Also having customizable Scroll Wheel Resistance of choosing Smooth Scroll Wheel or Tactile Scroll Wheel and the V2 had 20000 DPI Sensitivity and 650 IPS tracking speed.Now that was the V2 Pro I am reviewing the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro Customizable Wireless Gaming Mouse which the company has raised the bar.10+1 programmable buttons its Razer Hyperscroll Tilt Wheel and Razer Focus Pro 30K DPI Optical Sensor.   You still have the choice of Tactile Scroll Wheel Smart-Reel Mode and Free-Spin Scrolling Mode.As for these modes tactile when you scroll with the center scroll wheel you can feel it click.  The Free-Spin is literally no click and it's a bit of a trip to scroll with no click and you feel the wheel become free spinning. The Smart-Reel is a way to activate from Tactile to Free-Spin easily by flicking the wheel.You have 13-Zone Chroma Lighting with full underglow powered by Razer Chroma RGB and utilizes the Razer Optical Gen-3 Switches.  According to Razer "From an improved 90-million click lifecycle with zero double-clicking issues to a blistering 0.2ms actuation with no debounce delay enjoy reliability and speed that outshines all others".It also is known for low-latency gaming.  As for the wireless Razer has said of the product "Razer HyperSpeed Wireless: Enjoy ultra-responsive gaming with speeds 25% faster than other wireless tech. Upgrade to true 4KHz polling rate with the Razer Mouse Dock Pro or HyperPolling Wireless Dongle (both sold separately)".Granted it's $20 more than the awesome Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse both are pricey and of course the DeathAdder being the lightest of the two.  But by no means does it mean the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro Customizable Wireless Gaming Mouse is less of a mouse.If anything gamers want the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro because it's super light.  But the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is not heavy at all and its light just not ultralight compared to the DeathAdder V3.As for the Synapse software you have numerous options to customize the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro.  it's easy to enable and disable modes and customize the buttons and 13-Zone Chroma RGB lighting.And with it being so easy to customize and also the ergonomic feel of the mouse It is no doubt a comfortable mouse and I do like the 10+1 dedicated buttons plus the customizable scroll wheel.So this begs to ask the question is it worth the under $160 price tag?  While it's big gaming brand competitor does include a docking station which is a plus for $10 more.  This one you have to pay $20 more for the charging puck and even more for the docking station.But for Razer products you're going to be paying a premium no matter what.I’ve said it many times on my reviews of big brand gaming hardware and you pay a premium for a gaming brand’s hardware/accessories. It’s just how it is. If you don’t like it there are third party gaming companies that offer their products much cheaper.But the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro Customizable Wireless Gaming Mouse is no doubt a wonderful mouse that is expensive but the standalone is much cheaper but if you want to charge your mouse the docking station or the wireless charge puck is expensive.But for those who are dedicated to gaming especially for competitive eSports it’s a dependable mouse and the fact that Razer is a company that is dedicated to putting out quality products and has its strong following of gamers who stand by the product.But which to choose?.... the Basilisk V3 Pro vs. DeathAdder V3 Pro?  If you want the lightest mouse from Razer then the DeathAdder V3 Pro definitely.  But don't count out the Basilisk V3 Pro as it's light but also ergonomic and it just feels good in your hand.  Again I love the DeathAdder V3 Pro but having used this for a month I found that I like how this feels much better.  It may not be as light but I just feel that the customization and bells and whistles of the Basilisk V3 Pro is much more to my liking.  But again this is subjective to what kind of gamer you are and what your needs are.  If you can go for both go for both.  But if you choose one it's up to you what is more important?The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro Customizable Wireless Gaming Mouse is highly recommended!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I've been using the Basilisk since v1. I currently have the v2 Ultimate. When I saw that Razer released the v3 wired I wished for a wireless version. Well here it is! Being a Razer fan I had high hopes. This is a comparison between v2 Ultimate and v3. I have the base version for $159.99 which I think is ridiculously high especially for including no charging base.Physically the v2 and v3 look near identical. The only way to tell the difference by looking face down is that the v3 has a textured finish whereas the v2 is smooth.Scroll wheel:The main difference in functionally however is the new infinite scroll wheel. You can turn this feature on and off via the button on top. When you do switch it on and off there's a mechanical sound. You can also set it to automatic via the synapse software. The infinite scroll feels just like Logitech which I love.Left bottom trigger:Known as the gun trigger for first person shooters. On v2 you could change out the trigger with the included different lengths. Not so on the v3. What you get is what you get. That said the one it comes with is a middle length and suitable for most gaming situations.Charging:The v2 must be charged with the proprietary micro usb cable. It's not the input portion but rather the shape of the cable head that prevents you from using any regular micro usb cable. The v2 ultimate also includes a charging stand you place on it to charge. Basically if you lose the cable you're screwed. On the v3 base it's usb-c and works with any usb-3 cable which is infinitely more convenient. Charging upgrade options (sold separately) for the v3 include a wireless charging puck that you screw underneath the mouse allowing you to wirelessly charge it with any wireless qi charger. Also sold separately is the charging stand. For the v2 ultimate people have been having issues with the connection between the charging stand and the mouse. After a year or two it becomes loose so it no longer charges. For the v3 it's magnetic so you won't have that issue.Verdict:The upgrades on v3 are great actually especially the infinite scroll. But I don't understand why Razer made a base model priced so high? It's currently as of 9/18/22 $159.99 without any other charging options beside the usb-c cable. The full upgrade with the wireless charging puck and magnetic stand is $229.98! While the v2 Ultimate was $159.99 and is currently on Amazon for $100+ and I've seem it on sale for $79.99. IMHO even though the v3 is a great mouse I honestly don't feel that the cost justifies the upgrade.
4,The Razer Basilisk V3Pro is the most advanced mouse Razer has released to date. It has 30K DPI Optical Sensor which is a little overkill but it's definitely the most advanced among mouses. My favorite thing about the mouse is the tactile vs free spin hyper scroll. You can switch between individual clicks and to infinite spin in the click of a button. Don't bother testing it when it's not connected it only works when you are connected via cord Bluetooth or dongle. The mouse click is extra tactile and feels great it has buttons in very convenient places to make it a dream for gamers. I love the ergonomic feel of it the thumb rest is something I never knew I needed. RGB is a big part of this mouse with 13 Zone Chroma Lighting and the chance to customize up to 11 buttons. It's a beautiful experience and goes with the modern day gaming experience. When using it in gaming it's highly accurate and versatile and casual users or power users can also benefit from its comfort and the hyper scroll features. It connects in 3 different ways-- it connects through the included USB C Cord (which also Charges it) the 2.4Ghz Dongle and Bluetooth. Surprisingly the Bluetooth works quite well but I wouldn't use it for gaming - I'd stick with the dongle which is flawless. It looks amazingly normal when you turn off the RGB if you just want to use it for a casual ergonomic experience. The battery life is solid and should last you awhile. My biggest con about this mouse is the fact that you can't charge it wirelessly without buying a puck and wireless accessory. I think this is low for Razer since it is already an extremely pricey mouse.
5,Having been using "gaming" mice for over 20 years starting with the Boomslang in 2000 this Basilisk will be my new go to for daily and gaming. I can sell my excess mice like the several finalmouse and Razer  easily with no regrets. Besides things like the g502 and finalmouse copying razer in the past to outrageous degree the Basilisk does things they WON'T do but those companies will market it to you as if you are getting the benefit. My first boot up with 2.4ghz was like I had used it for years getting a few wins in Apex before testing BT and wired mode. It might be a bit lighter/smaller than I expected but after a week of use it is normal and the battery just keeps on going. Using on a glass infused mouse pad.I repeat. I will use this over my favorite three finalmouse anything Logitech makes (the g502 is even worse looking now) my other Razer mice and even a few others I have laying around.In the box-Basilisk Mouse 2.4ghz dongle adapter for dongle usba to usbc cable stickers instructions.Pros--Software is better than elsewhere. It is leagues better than competitors-Can swap between smooth and tactile scroll instantly-Three connection modes with BT/wired/dongle to work with literally any device I have tested (even messed around on Mac but... who would use this on mac?)-Light weight and could be weighted if you desperately wanted (changing weights is marketing it doesn't matter and won't make you better)-Glides on there are top tier-Sensor is overkill. Honestly can't wait until Finalmouse and Logitech take it and pretend it is needed. Not sure even why razer has it.-More buttons than needed for most gaming these days in easy to use locations-Very clicky L/R.-Wireless works perfect as does wired-Battery lasts all weekCons--Sensor is overkill. It really is too good and no one needs one this good-Some things would need to be setup before you use it on something like a Mac or Android device. It will work but specific specialty features would be set to 'default'-BT mode is just great not perfect. It is the fault of BT. More than adequate for android and similar use but at high ranking fps play??? I don't know if I would trust it over wired.-Right handed-Price might be too high for a mouse if you don't keep it for long-I think mmo heavy people might want more buttons if they are used to itI could flesh this out but honestly if you are reading up on this a bunch maybe it isn't for you? Or maybe you are on the fence.... if you are get it. I really can't say enough good things about it.
4,I wouldn't say this is the perfect mouse due to it's lower polling rate on average but it's pretty close if you can get past that. The ergo is great. It's light and feature rich. All in all it's a solid mouse.
5,I have always strayed away from wireless mice. Mainly because of the bad experiences when they first hit the market. Razer has proven that it has come a long way.It just feels good in the hand. It molds to your hand for a comfortable grip leading to a more relaxed grip.The RGB is a great touch for those that enjoy RGB lighting. It is at the perfect brightness to not distract but give a nice ambiance to your setup.The adjustable scroll wheel was more helpful that I thought it would be. It goes from free wheeling to a single click with the press of a button. Depending on your game it could be very helpful. I generally use the freewheeling for scrolling webpages and swap to single for gaming.The battery life is excellent. In over a month of use not once did it die mid game on me. This is due to the automatic downscaling when the battery is getting low. As a casual gamer I never really noticed. On a competitive gaming field this may be more noticeable but chances are you are charging the mouse any time you are not at the computer. My main complaint is the ability to wirelessly charge the mouse but having to buy extras to be able to do so. It's like DLC for a mouse...  You need to spend an additional $20 to buy the wireless charging puck and then buy the wireless charger on top of that. I am not sure if a "wireless charging mousepad" will work with this but not including at least the wireless puck is a lame move.I would have preferred a button to increase and decrease the DPI on the fly instead of having to cycle through all the DPI settings. I did find in razers defense that the razer app allows you to set custom DPI settings on the mouse so once you find what you like you can add only those settings. I found myself only using 2 different DPI settings so switching was easy.Overall this is a great mouse for both competitive and casual gamers alike. The app gives a lot of control over the mouse. It is a bit pricey but you can tell that there was a lot of thought and time put into the mouse development.
5,First off let me say I was a long time Razer mouse user of the DeathAdder line but started having issues with them and the right mouse button not working or random double clicks after a while so I changed over to the Logitech G502 Hero mouse a few years ago and have been using it so I will do my comparison between those 2 mice.The Logitech Hero is a little heaver and doesn't slide as easily as the Razer Basilisk on my large full desk mousepad.  Love the RGB under glow on the Basilisk that gives it an almost floating effect to the mouse.  Braided charging cable is durable and LOVE that its USB-C so it should last a lot longer then micro USB as well as its easier to plug in.  Also love that they give you an easy option of adding a charging puck to the bottom of the mouse to allow for full wireless charging on the same chargers as your standard phone (Qi charger).Battery life so far has been about 4 days or so on a full charge playing World of Warcraft Call of Duty  CS:Go and Diablo. This is with about 4-5 hour gaming sessions on week nights.  Mouse is easy to configure with the Razer Synapse software and you can even make some power changes to make the mouse last even longer including turning off some RGBs sleep mode sooner etc.Ergonomics of this mouse is great. Thumb rest is nice and perfect size for a mid to larger hand.  Love that you can use it either USB dongle OR Bluetooth and the dongle will plug into the bottom of the mouse for storage in case you need to take this mouse with you on the go using a gaming laptop or to a LAN event.Overall this is a fantastic upgrade and very happy with the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro!
5,I've had several Razer products over many years and have been happy with all of them. I'm a casual gamer so I use all my gaming peripherals casually. If you're looking for a hardcore review this is not it I'm sorry! :(I enjoy mice that offer that "free scroll" option so I can spin that sucker like there's no tomorrow (responsibly of course). I also appreciate the more tactile and precise scroll that's normally found on mice. Lo and behold this mouse you can actually choose between the two feelings…similar to an ACER keyboard I reviewed some months ago that you could choose between clicky or linear key "feelings" or tactile feedback. Basically I love options and this mouse gives you many options.I also love the RGBs and am not afraid to be booed or eye-rolled at. I love stuff that lights up and I love colorful stuff so loving RGBs is a no-brainer for me. This mouse has all that and a bag of customizable chips (ha). I REALLY love the underglow lighting it has. I have a headphone stand that does this too and it looks neat on my white computer desk (as I'm sure it'd look awesome on any color desk but for example mine is white).You also have the option to use this thing three ways - wired wireless or bluetooth. Again I like the options. :)The Basilisk V3 Pro slides around on my desk and mousepad flawlessly and tracks like a dream for my casually gaming self.Overall happy with this purchase and would most definitely buy again. The battery is great and there are several programmable clicky buttons that I think will last a good long while. I don't think I'd pay full price though…I'd wait for it to go on sale like I do most things. It's a wonderful mouse though and a joy to game with.
5,I am someone that has a mouse purchasing problem. I currently own over 30 mice and have sold many many more. If have probably tried every single mouse that is out on the market today. That being said I don't buy into the mouse reviewers' opinion that you need to give yourself 2 weeks to adapt to a mouse to know if it will "work" for you. If it is a good mouse (good for you personally) you should be able to pick it up and use it right away with no adjustment period or having to invent a new grip to be able to use the mouse.The Basilisk V3 Pro is a great mouse because I could pick it up and use it instantly I can use it in claw fingertip and palm. I have kind of large hands at 21.5x11 and the basilisk is just big enough for me that my fingers won't overlap when I palm it. Thou I prefer to use it with a claw grip over palm. Let's get some details out of the way its heavy at 113g and being a fingertip grip player its way too heavy for me to fingertip it. But for palm and claw its fine. The mouse is built solid like a tank no rattles side flex button movement good clicks (not great) but good the scroll wheel is amazing it tilts both ways and has the infinity scroll option like the g502. Side buttons are placed in a great spot and both work great. Skates are fine I won't change them and I change the skates on almost every mouse I own. And I love the rubber molded sides I put grips on every mouse I own and it's a nice addition when razer puts the rubber side grips on will they hold up over time? Overall it's a solid mouse if you don't mind the weight and the shape is safe with the flat sides.The main question I ask myself about every mouse I try is will I keep it? Is it worth the money? Will I even use it or will it just sit on a shelf collecting dust. So the Basilisk V3 Pro will most likely not be my main for fps games but for a desktop mouse browsing rpg games etc... yes I will def keep it and use it for those things. No need to wear and tear on my starlight 12.
5,I had a love/hate relationship with the original Basilisk.  I actually bought that mouse 3 times (and returned it twice).  I loved the feel of it - since my favorite mouse is the G502 I own 6 of them for all the computers/laptops I use the Lightspeed is my daily driver on my main computer.  However there were a few things I hated about it.  I hated the scroll wheel since it was very hard to press and personally the adjustable resistance for it never felt good no matter what I adjusted it to.  I also never realized how much I used the free scrolling on the G502 until it was gone.  This was the main reason I kept sending it back. The other reason is because at the time I was really big into Apex Legends.  I had the G7 and G8 programmed for my abilities and losing those buttons was very hard on me.I had packed up my last purchase of the Basilisk and tucked it away in my basement never to really be thought of again.  I did try breaking it out 1 more time but ultimately I went back to my G502 Lightspeed due to the fact it always is charged via the charging mousepad.  Let's face it the dock on the Basilisk kind of was a bad design since it didn't always line up perfectly when placing it on there.So when I had the opportunity to try out the Basilisk V3 I hopped on it.  Hoping there was some saving grace to a mouse that I had a love/hate relationship for.  Well it turns out that hate has almost diminished and it's full of love.  Some quick things:  left and right mouse buttons have a textured surface instead of smooth the RGB lighting is a bit different and it does not have a removable paddle on the side for the thumb.  Other than that externally I don't see a big difference.First off the wheel feels amazing on this.  The resistance is just in that right spot so if you want to scroll fast while it is tactical (a hard spin will make it go a few extra scrolls).  The wheel click is so much softer now.  I no longer felt like I had to fight with my mouse and grip in order to push it in (in Apex Legends a fast double wheel click was to ping which was almost impossible for me with the previous).  And it introduces a free spin.  If you buy this you may be confused like me.  I took it out of the box and couldn't for the life of me figure out how to enable free spin.  Turns out the mouse has to be turned on to either of the wireless modes on the bottom or plugged in via the included cable which is also used for charging.  The mechanic to enable it needs an electrical signal. When it is plugged in and you hit the button you hear a little "click" enabling or disabling it.  I am worried a little about the durability of that but I guess that is what warranties are for.The only thing they didn't address is the 2 extra buttons from the G502 that they didn't copy over.  I still don't understand the reasoning for this since they literally copied the exact same design.  However I am not docking any points for that since not everyone uses them and maybe that is why they didn't include them. I tend to use them in almost every game I play but since life has gotten busier I am gaming far less.I can't comment on any of the wireless charging features since I just got the plain mouse with none of those features however as long as you don't go crazy on the RGB colors and brightness the battery lasts a good while.  I will probably invest in a dock in the future.Will this replace my G502 Lightspeed as a daily driver? No however this will replace my G502 in my laptop bag or on my gaming/media computer hooked up to my TV since it is wireless and would make it much easier.  I haven't fully decided that yet.  Overall Razer made a really good mouse that I actually won't mind using.  Also Synapse blows G-Hub out of the water and if they did include those 2 extra buttons it would have been goodbye Logitech.  In my photos the V3 is on the left the original is on the right.
5,I am VERY impressed with this mouse. It's very comfortable for my claw grip has great battery life feels great to use and has a number of features I never even THOUGHT to ask for. I have no criticism for this mouse and if you look at my other reviews you'll know that this is high praise.Notable features:* Button for sensitivity clutch. Ever wish you could quickly reduce sensitivity on your mouse while trying to get better precision? Razer thought you might and has included a button that will reduce mouse sensitivity while it's held slowing the travel of your mouse for mine fine aiming. Never miss another shot with a sniper rifle.* "Smart-reel". This feature will detect when you quickly flick the mouse wheel and enables free scrolling (infinite scroll) until it slows down at which point the scroll mechanism re-engages and it becomes a clicky scroll again like a standard mouse wheel. Sometimes I just roll the mouse and feel it click back into place because it feels very satisfying.* The wrap-around RGB lighting is a treat to look at. It's nestled near the base of the mouse gently illuminating the mousepad below in whatever settings you choose in Chroma Studio. I have some words for Synapse as a software package overall but Chroma Studio is easy to use and offers lots of customizability.There are a number of other features on this mouse I haven't used but they all seem very handy. It has profiles that can be cycled through using a hardware button on the bottom or linked to games it has a feature called "hypershift" which lets you hold a hotkey to make your mouse do entirely different stuff than usual like the normal shift button on a keyboard. There's probably a bunch of other stuff too.
5,This wireless mouse is blinged and large. All the bells and whistles of a top end wired mouse with a wireless 90hr battery span. It comes at a cost. This mouse is heavy at 3.8 ounces. That is the only real fault. It obviously needs a big battery for the 90hr run. The materials are top notch. Ergonomically it is wonderful. More comfortable than anyother mouse I have used. It is also feature rich. With Razers software you can easily change the rgb dpi change button layout. The rgb is well designed. The entire unit is well designed. The mouse has excellent button layout. Then the Basilisk V3 Pro can connect via dongle or Bluetooth. This is also the top end of wireless mice in every direction. Response time is as good as it gets. I have recently reviewed the Razer Death Adder v3 pro. Both mice are similarly priced but for very different reasons. This is a difficult decision if you're deciding on these highend mice. The Death Adder is a zero nonsense mouse. All go and no show. The Death Adder v3 pro and the Basilisk v3 pro are identical in response variety of surfaces they work on and dpi are all the same. However unlike the DeathAdder the Basilisk does make useful use of the software. The DeathAdder pro v3 is about half the weight  of the Basilisk pro v3. It is light as the feather and equally well made. The DeathAdder is the mouse of choice for competitive gaming and it has it's own competition. The Basilisk v3 pro is more comfortable and slightly larger. Suitable for competitive gaming but ideal for desktop use and casual gaming with the ability to compete. The Basilisk's heft is also more stable. The big question. Is it worth it? If you want one mouse and the best mouse this might be it for you. It is excellent. If you are into the light weight competitive thing and are short on change the Ninjutso is the most bang for the buck. If you want top quality Razer v3 pro products are as good as it gets. The Basilisk v3 pro is the cream of the crop.
5,If you are a gamer you probably already know Razer and the quality and performance they are known for.  The Basilisk V3 Pro is no exception.  This is an excellent mouse not just for the gamers out there but for creators and productivity power users alike.  Much more suitable as a “daily driver” than the Deathadder line.[TL;DR] Great ergonomics for small to average hands. Smooth good stops incredibly precise and a killer scroll wheel.  Wired or wireless operation (comes with an excellent noodle soft cable).  Everything you would expect from a top-tier peripheral device.  I only wish you could program and swap between multiple devices with a click (which is available from some of the competition).Build and Ergonomics:Excellent.  As far as ergonomics go this thing fits like a glove (if you are right handed) but I could see there being some potential problems for folks with larger hands/fingers.  The buttons are well placed and easily reachable and the rubber sides provide the right amount of grip vs slip.Build quality is top-notch.  The feel of the plastic (up top) is slightly more grainy/textured than what you may be used to if you are coming from the Deathadder.  I like it.  The texture is less susceptible to showing oil from your hands and palm sweat spots dry quicker due to the added surface area. Down below you get a compartment to store the WiFi Wart a button to toggle profiles and a switch to go from Bluetooth to OFF to WiFi modes.  The compartment is replaced by a wireless charging puck if you buy this mouse with the dock or upgrade to the dock at a later time.The USB-C port/receptacle and included cable (works as a wired mouse too) are exceptional.  I really appreciate the attention to detail from the engineering department… PROPER strain relief on the cable and the chassis acts as a mechanical support to relieve the USB-C port from side load/strain.  It’s the little things!The RGB features are nice.  I prefer just a touch if present at all and quickly switched it to reactive mode in the Synapse software.  You can go mild to wild with this mouse as the underglow strip can be adjusted in segments.  I’m not all about the RGB but Razer has always been able to deliver it in a way that can be scaled down to a tasteful level. This device continues on with that philosophy.  Go mild or go wild your choice.Performance:Great scroll wheel!  You can click the button behind the wheel to toggle tactile or free-spin mode or you can go into Synapse and enable “smart-reel” which will flip into free-spin if you flick it with a little authority.  Certainly gives LG’s MX Master a run for it’s money but stop performance is still better on the LG (even my original MX master).  Tactile mode is smoother than LG’s offerings.The folks at Razer gave us elevin (11) programmable buttons plus a “shift” option if 11 just doesn't cut it for you.  I especially enjoy the thumb button (sensitivity clutch) which by default toggles the cursor into a slow precision mode as you hold it down.  Incredibly useful for productivity work.  With the Deathadder I had relied on the DPI toggles for this.  Fantastic touch Razer!The weight is perfect IMO.  This is subjective but my observation is that it’s heavy enough to have good damping but light enough to handle with a finger grip.  My preference is for a heavier mouse (even for gaming).  The Deathadder is lighter and firmly at my limit for mouse lightness.The feet slide well as expected and the stopping performance is excellent.  Not much of a noticeable difference from my Deathadder but notably more precise than the top offerings from LG.  The mouse does work on glass and feel is still fair; good to know you can if you need to.Not much to say about the sensor other than it’s probably overkill for my needs.  I do notice an improvement over my old Deathadder Elite on less than ideal surfaces.Areas that need improvement:-Cant flash settings to the mouse.  This is a problem because it’s an RGB mouse that runs on batteries and both default profiles give you full RGB.  The issue is if you lock your machine it will default to the profiles flashed to the mouse not that which you set up in Synapse.  The mouse can completely discharge (even with the cable plugged in) because it pumps it’s marvelous RGB like it’s been listening to way too much Lionel Ritchie…. all night long.  The work around… let Windows lock itself.  It works but dare I say I am less than pleased with that suggestion from Razer.  Not enough to take away a star but a nuisance nonetheless.-No option to pair to multiple devices.That’s all folks.  This mouse should be on your short list if you are looking for a versatile top-tier mouse that you can use for serious gaming and productivity/creative work.
5,Great quality product and very customization as with anything from Razer. I do like the fact that you can use this either blue tooth 2.4ghz or wired. You can charge with the USB c cable and use the mouse at the same time it is charging. Once ready for the wireless you can disconect and plug into the adapter that is included. The settings are very easy to setup in the software for the configuration you want set for polling up to the DPI for your movement. I turned it all the way up and it is so fast and responsive.Only drawback is the wireless charging if you want to call it that. You have to buy a different charger stand that you get a charging disc with to replace on here. This will allow you to place this on the stand when not in use and charge the mouse. This is not included and comes at an additional cost.Over all great product that feels good in the hand and is easily configured to meet my needs.
3,My daily driver mouse before receiving this one was the Razer Basilik V2. The V2 and V3 are nearly identical which is a good thing. It's just the right size to be usable with claw or palm grip and the thumb rest is something I can't live without now. The main difference for me is the upgraded lighting which looks great on the V3 Pro and the upgraded scroll wheel. Both tactile and free-spin feel great and the smart-reel works really well. The wireless also works well with no detectable lag and the battery life is solid. I have no complaints with the sensor or switches the sensor tracks smoothly and precisely and the switches feel properly clicky and responsive.I do have a big problem with the scrollwheel texture on this mouse though. It has rows of hard rubber spikey nubs which ostensibly are to help it feel more precise but in practice I found it painful to use. After a long day of use my fingertip felt raw. Today I found myself actively avoiding scrolling so I didn't have to touch it. A smooth/rubbery wheel would have been way more comfortable and accomplished the same goal. I will probably end up using some fine grit sandpaper to take the point off the nubs.I also think the wireless charging puck and dock should have been included. $160 for just the mouse is a bit steep and I'm not a fan of having accessories that should be included being withheld and sold at a premium.Overall the fundamentals of the mouse are excellent but I knocked off 1 star for the painful scrollwheel and another for nickel and diming the charging dock.
5,This is the best mouse I have ever used so much so that both me and my husband both have this mouse now. Not only does it work great with if you already have razer products like I do but even if not it comes with its own software so you can fully customize it. It lets you change your buttons to open whatever you like i have mine doing notepad and calculator but your short cut buttons can be whatever. Also you can set up different lightings so you can change from one light setting to another to make it light up the way you want. It lasts awhile even gaming with one full charge and doesn't take but a couple hours to fully charge it and you can use it while it charges as well. Some games have a set up where it has its own rgb color choices that it will flash if you let it too. This is by far the best mouse and for the price I promise you will never need another mouse. What more could you want it has a dpi on it as well so it sets for your custom speed needed with whatever game your playing in. It is comfortable to use for long periods of time and I never had any issues with it in my game play. I say grab this one you won't be sorry and be even great as a gift too.

My current daily work mouse is the Logitech MX Master 3 and this Razer Basilisk V3 Pro mouse is equally if not more comfortable to use due to how light it feels. I've never used an ergonomic gaming mouse that had a thumb rest and didn't realize until now how much better it feels than my usual Logitech G Po (that my husband has taken over lately). I've only used it for work so far because I haven't had much down time for gaming yet this week but so far I am loving it! One of my favorite features of the Basilisk is the Hyperscroll tilt wheel's ability to switch between free spin and tactile cycling.As far as gaming mouses (mice?) go it's not the lightest but also not too heavy either if that makes sense. I've included pictures that show the weight difference between the Basilisk the MX Master 3 and 2 other brand gaming mouses. The Basilisk weighs 115 grams with the USB dongle inside and 113 grams without.The RGB Chroma underglow is very attractive and easily customizable with Synapse (along with all of the programable buttons). I already had Synapse on my computer because I use a RAZER headset so it was incredibly easy to set up this mouse when it arrived.The only and I mean ONLY complaint I have is that the multi-function trigger is a little difficult to reach. Could just be that I have small hands though.Overall given all of the features and the quality of the mouse I would definitely say it's worth the price!
5,I am not a gamer but I appreciate a quality mouse as I’m on the computer for many hours a day.  This mouse has an excellent shape to it it feels very comfortable in the hand.  I’ll often grab the mouse between thumb and pinky and the distance is just right.It tracks well.  You have multiple options for connecting though I found the standard Bluetooth to be plenty responsive and didn’t need to run corded or 2.4ghz.I did find myself accidentally hitting the button on the left default mapped to “back.” Though after using the mouse for a bit I became used to it and it wasn’t a problem.I do have a Razer keyboard and this looks right at home next to it.  If you install the utility you can customize the color of the backlight.This is a high end peripheral with performance to match.
5,Picked this up as a spare mouse for my laptop and over all I have been super happy with it. The mouse has an excellent shape and is feature packed. Combining the mouse with the RAZER software makes for a great experience. One of the things I'm really digging is the ability store up to 5 profiles on deck and it makes it super handy when swapping between devices. This mouse supports both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz (the dongle is included). This mouse would be even better with the dock but can be charged via the USB C cable that's included also making this a wired mouse if you want it configured like that. I haven't played around with remapping the mouse buttons as of yet but looks to be a handy feature. Overall this mouse is feature backed and amazing and I'd happily purchase another one.
5,I love this mouse it’s actually similar to a Logitech g502 hero which is what I had previously. I already use a razer keyboard so this mouse and keyboard are now synced with each other with the hyper wireless feature. Thumb rest on this mouse is definitely something I got used to since owning a g502 Hero so I’m glad that’s there. Overall 5 stars. Very satisfied. And the hyper wireless works very well no lag input comparing to a wired mouse which a lot of ppl would argue about that but so far hasn’t been the issue using the wireless feature with this mouse.
5,Razer is a big name when it comes to computer peripherals. For good reason. They make great hardware. This mouse is no exception.It is wireless using a 2.4GHz dongle. It's just as responsive as a wired mouse. I've experienced no break in signal and no latency.It has a wonderful ergonomic design with a small platform for your thumb and the texture is great!The weight of the mouse is perfect for me. I've used lightweight mice before and they can sometimes be TOO responsive. Sometimes when I clicked it registered as a click and drag. The Basilisk has a little weight to it so it stays put when I click. It's not heavy by any stretch of the imagination. It just feels right.To top it all off the battery life is amazing. You can adjust the brightness of the cool RGB lighting to prolong the battery life through their app.For gaming and my everyday driver this mouse is fantastic! 🖱️👍
5,Overall impression: Having the Basilisk v3 wired version for many years I am happy they have came out with the wireless version! The new v3 Pro as ton of features that makes it a top tier gaming mouse. What I really like is the magnetic charging dock similar to the Apple MagSafe for iPhone. The mouse weight very light and of course full RGB is included in 2022. Would recommend this over the Basilisk Ultimate and the Blackadder V3 Pro.
5,Works as well as my son's Alienware gaming mouse.  He hasn't ever been unhappy with this one.  I use a different Razer myself with similarly positive results.  Definitely recommended!
5,Razer Basilisk V3 Pro.. Been using this in a FPS game and just wow on the accuracy and turning ability. I don't usually use a regular or gaming mouse so this was new to me. Quality is nice and the button placements couldn't be better. Fits my adult hand perfectly. Buttons are very responsive. Like the design and the RGB's. Always Honest Reviews.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The mouse feels good to me. A little on the larger side. So if you have smaller hands or prefer smaller lighter mice I would not recommend it. It tracks smooth has a really good set of pads on the bottom that glide across the mouse pad smoothly. Over all a great mouse. The only downside is it forces you to download razer synapse software so if you do not have any other razer products this will be another software you need.
3,Update 8/29/2022: Finally after a lot of back and fourth with Razer I got my account validated and could finish the registration process. However I am still unable to use the software as it will not open on my M1 Mac. I do not know if it is a compatibility issue or what but without the software my review must remain 3 stars. Maybe when they make the Synapse 3 available for Mac things might work.TL;DR: Razer makes excellent gaming equipment and the Basilisk V3 Pro is no exception. From the ergonomic grip design and 11 programmable buttons to the super smooth glide to the RGB lighting everything feels and looks great. The 30k DPI sensor is extremely accurate with absolutely no lag. The battery life claims 90 hours although I do not let my mice get down to zero before I charge. This mouse is also compatible with the wireless charging dock if you don’t want to deal with plugging it in but the dock is sold separately. Unfortunately this model does not support removable weights to change the weight of the mouse like some of the other competitors. The V3 Pro Synapse 3 software is also not compatible with Mac only Windows. Account creation was not smooth and had to reach out to support before I could use the software. I will update the review once I gain access to the software. This is a solid mouse for beginners to advanced gamers as I would expect from Razer.Pro’s:~Ergonomic design~11 Programable buttons~Very smooth glide~Precise 30k sensor~RGB all over~2.4 HyperSpeed wireless bluetooth and wired connection options~Great tactile feedback from buttons and scroll wheel~Plug ’n play with free software to program~Optional wireless charging dockCon’s:~No weights to add or subtract weight from the mouse like some of the comparable priced competitors~Wireless charging options is expensive~No button to switch from tactile scrolling to free scrolling~Unable to create account and therefore cannot use the software.~Synapse 3 software is only available for Windows not Mac. Mac must use older Synapse 2Review:Traditionally I am a Logitech user. From mice keyboards webcams I historically use Logitech instead of Razer. I bring this up because I believe these two companies are near direct rivals in products and I have the equal model to this Basilisk Pro. I purchased the Basilisk V3 because my Logitech is getting a bit old and I wanted to try something new.What is in the box:In the box you have the mouse the USB HyperSpeed wireless dongle a soft braided USB A to USB C cable to charge or use wired an adapter to extend the USB dongle if you have a desktop pc on the ground and want the dongle on your desk and the instruction manual.Setup:The basic mouse functionality is plug-n-play. The manual advices to charge the mouse completely before using it wirelessly so I plugged the mouse into the computer using the cable and could use it right away. Once the mouse fully charged I simply put the dongle into the USB port on your computer and switch the bottom of the mouse down to the HyperSpeed option. You can also connect your mouse via Bluetooth but I find the HyperSpeed to be much more responsive.Software:As of writing this review I am not able to create a Razer account which is necessary before you can use the software. I submitted a support ticket to Razer for help. The most recent software the Synapse 3 is only compatible with Windows. I use a MacBook Pro M1 Max and have to use the older Synapse 2 which is a little disappointing but assume Razer will update this in the future.Feel and function:The feel of the Razer is great. Comparing it to the Logitech equal the Razer feels better in my hand. The back of the Razer fills my palm better so it is a little bigger than the Logitech. The button placements are all very similar and have very nice click feedback. The scroll wheel is very nice. It too has very nice tactile feedback and can be spun slowly or quickly depending on how hard you push it. One function that I like on the Logitech that the Razer does not have is the option to switch to smooth scroll. The rubber on the left and right side of the mouse is great for maneuvering the mouse around if you need to pick it up and “reset” its position on the mousepad. The thumb support is perfect for my hand relieving any stress my thumb might have while gaming. Finally the pads on the bottom of the mouse provide an extremely smooth glide much smoother than the Logitech. I do wish this model had extra weights to add one more level of customization for the serious gamers.Conclusion:The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is a very high quality gaming mouse. There are so many buttons and with the software so many programmable features. Unfortunately as of writing this review I am unable to comment on the software since I cannot log into it. I will update this review once I hear back from Razer and gain access but until then this review will set at a 3 star since the software is a huge part of the user experience.
2,Base hardware function of the mouse is good. However taking off 3 stars because if you want your profiles with custom RGB lighting you will need to have the Razer Synapse software on every PC you own. If you are also low on USB ports and want to connect via Bluetooth the profiles do not work even if the PC you are working with has Razer Synapse.This is disappointing because I am expecting the onboard memory to remember my custom profile including RGB. Unfortunately it won't remember your RGB lighting profiles with its onboard memory if you set up the profiles on one PC with Razer Synapse save it to the onboard memory and switch to a different PC that does not have the Razer Synapse software.Disappointed considering this is a $200+ mouse.
