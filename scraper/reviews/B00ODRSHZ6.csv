5,I needed a work headset for Team calls and these are perfect. Truly plug and play as soon as I plugged in the USB a teams pop-up started to display helpful tips and connected. Button remote is great for desk doesn't slide around like others I've used. Sound quality is good mic quality is good. Really love the flexibility of the ear pieces and how lightweight the entire headset is. Mic magnet holder is perfect for using as just headphones. Worn 4 hours straight first day for training and no sorness of ears even with my glasses on.
4,The output sound and mic quality are good quality as expected for the price range. The only real issue I have with the headset is that after several hours of wearing it like 4 5 hours it starts to hurt your ears because the headset presses down / clamps on your ears too hard. For me even after taking it off my ears hurt for a few hours after too. If you're not needing to wear these for that long of a period though it's great.Since I do need to wear a headset for long work hours though I'll probably just keep these as a back up and try to get a more comfortable pair somewhere else.
5,Need for work Teams and Zoom from home. Lawn care going on just outside an open window. I apologized to other people and was assured they heard nothing except my voice.Comfortable ear pad although thickness does lead to a bit of heat.
5,I used this headset almost a month on both computer and phone.  I usually used it for meeting and phone conversation.  It is very comfortable and the sound quality is very good.  I like it very much!
4,I've had this headset for 2 years and I'm satisfied with the purchase.  While I'm not on the phone all day long  I do wear them for hours at a time because they do a great job of muffling out the house noise.  I haven't found them uncomfortable at all.  And I haven't had any problem with parts breaking off like other reviewers have said  but at the end of the day I hang them from a hook on the side of my desk so they aren't getting banged around.  The only 'real' issue I have with them is that sometimes when I connect them to my phone  the volume cuts out during the call.  It only happens when I'm on calls however  I can watch movies for hours using the headset and the volume never cuts out.I would recommend them to someone looking for a good headset and I'd probably buy them again  except maybe the bluetooth ones.
4,I recently started a job that requires me to be on a headset about 5 hours a day and I've had good experience with Jabra so I chose this product.There have been a few hiccups but I still think I made the right choice.The pros are simple and quick to list: reasonable price high quality and ease of use.There are several cons but please keep in mind I'm overall more satisfied than not with the product:- After about 2 months the headset just stopped working. It was no longer detected by any computer. I have no idea what I might have done to cause this so it must be a defect.Fortunately due to the holidays Amazon's return window was still open when it stopped working and I got my replacement lightning fast before I even mailed the old one back.(If this hadn't happened I could have gone through Jabra's warranty service which I know from experience is also painless though slightly more work.)- The in-line volume/mute control is a bit awkward. The underside is made up of foam sticky tape so you can presumably stick the control somewhere accessible. I generally like the idea of being able to put the control somewhere permanent and easy to reach/find but I wonder how well this was thought through (I don't know if this is common on other headsets).I don't really want to use this feature because I'm afraid of ruining my desk and don't know where I'd stick it to anyway since the choice would presumably be permanent. Also while I haven't used it it always seems like the cord between the control and the headset is just short enough that using the adhesive would be annoying.Also the foam comes protected by a  thin sheet of clear plastic which you can peel off when you want to stick the control. The problem though is this plastic seems to peel off by itself after a few weeks just from holding the control in my hands during calls. This concerns me because there's no obvious way to remove the foam so I'm not sure how to deal with it inevitably coming off other than by forcibly removing it entirely.- The unit is all light plastic and feels a bit cheap but also means that it's light which is desirable. This isn't really bothersome you once you get over the initial feeling and the performance certainly doesn't match the cheap vibe of the construction.- The adjustments you can make on the unit don't really stay in place. You can pivot the microphone as well as adjust the headpiece to make it longer but neither of these adjustments click into position or anything. At first it seems doubtful that they'll stay in place at all. In the end they actually do seem to but the mic in particular does fall out of place if you so much as brush against it. This is something else that I don't really notice anymore perhaps because it's just a small thing to fix and/or because I've gotten used to repositioning it.Overall I'd buy this unless if you're looking for something with decent quality at a decent price. Don't buy it through if you're expecting you'll get some meticulously crafted high-end equipment. Because you're not.
5,This is a great headset.  I have a big head and it's hard to find a one-eared headset for work that is comfortable.  After wasting money on 3 or 4 cheaper options I decided to spend a little bit more and am so glad that I did.  The "call control unit" makes it so easy to see when I'm muted.  It's so much better for me than the standard tiny on-cord buttons.  The incoming audio is crystal clear and my spoken sound quality is fantastic.  I like that the microphone adjusts so I can move it out of my face when I'm just listening or use the headset over either ear.
5,Comfort is great. Audio quality is great. Good volume. I work from home and if I need real quiet I put on the headphones and no sound.
5,Excellent call quality and easy integration with Microsoft teams.Call quality and volume are good. Comfortable to wear and light. I’ve had some very subtle static but it doesn’t last long and it’s not a big interference.The cord is long enough and the control on it is handy as visual check and to control volume and muting when needed.I’ll hold on to these for a while and upgrade to the next version. This is a good entry pair good for light use.
5,Bought this to replace my other headset that quit working. I work from home so I needed something reliable. Clear sound blocks out the unnecessary. Perfect for a work from home setting.
5,Used this in a large call center went to work from home and new I'd need these. They are comfortable to wear all day and the sound is clear.
4,I've used this headset for about a month during the pandemic to help reduce room sounds (such as dog barking and others speaking) from impinging on my frequent Zoom meetings. The boom mic is helpful as I expected it to be given its classification as a "call center" headset. It requires no batteries and can be directly connected to the headphone jack of a laptop (I have a MacBook Air) or via a supplied adaptor to a USB port (which in my case requires another adaptor). The sound quality is very good both ways. I only hear breathing if I put the mic more or less in my mouth which is a silly thing to do and easily avoided. It is also light and relatively comfortable - relative that is to in-ear and over-ear headphones (Sony) that I also use. I frequently find myself forgetting to remove it after a call and wearing it for hours. It's lightness gives it a cheap feel but the benefit is well lightness - it doesn't feel fragile and it looks well on camera so this really isn't a concern to me. What is a concern is the mechanism that positions the boom mic which has a single axis that enables the boom to swing from below one's chin to about nose height. The height affects how well the mic picks up speech so this matters. I find it easy to adjust and like not having to worry about a second "in/out" axis - BUT IT SLIPS on its axis and I find myself frequently having to raise it up from chin height. It cannot be tightened. This is a relatively serious shortcoming. Less serious but real is the cord - it gets in the way of taking notes sometimes end up tangled around my arm and creates the risk of standing up without remembering to first disconnect...potential catastrophe lurks at the end of every call.In sum I use it but do not love it. I would consider the wireless versions of the same product.
5,its great produt to use no battery needed and use for both side ear.Easy yo mute unmute and volume control no need to change from laptop.
5,I bought two of these refurbished and they were just like new and work great. Good savings! Good product!
5,For a 2-ear headset that is wired I don't think that I have found any others that are as good of quality as this one.
4,It’s a decent headset but not sure why the cord from computer to control disc is so long.Makes it hard to stand/walk and talk.
4,I first bought the Jabra Elite 75t Earbuds as a replacement for my misplaced/lost wired Samsung standard issue Galaxy earbuds (which I liked a lot).  I ignored all the marketing aimed at using the wireless earbuds when jogging or at the gym.  Obviously they're most useful during those activities.  Not what I wanted or needed.  Having read in wirecutter that the Jabra Evolve 40 were a good pair of wired headphones and were especially good for long-conversations etc.  I decided to return the Jabra earbuds and get the wired headset.  It's been a couple of months.  I'm happy with the headset.  I don't miss my Jabra wireless earbuds.  I do miss my Samsung wired earbuds.  I would be hard-pressed to choose between the Jabra wired headset and the Samsung wired earbuds.  Actually the former would be good while sitting at my desk or talking a long time on the phone.  The latter would be good for taking with me while on the go.I'm only giving four stars because I had a difficult time getting the headset to work with Discord once and well I like to give four stars as a way to convey there may be room for improvement.  (I don't do that with Lyft or Uber drivers because anything but a five-star review apparently screws them over and Uber and Lyft are already doing a good job of that according to what I've heard.)
3,Customers are saying they cannot hear me. This is not good for my business.
3,My Microsoft headset had a short in it after nearly two years teaching online.  So I did a little reading and this brand consistently came up as a recommended headset brand.However I think two different teams designed this headset.  Maybe as a COVID response to increased demand.  It just doesn't function well for the price.Senior team (+): the volume button ring lights up when there is an incoming Teams call; sound (ear) is good; recording quality is pretty good; side indicator lights up when you're online/on a call; like the packaging and that the earphones can swivel to pack flat.Junior team (-): the ear phones are covered with this fabric that just slides all over; the headset consistently pulls your hair out; the ear phones are small and fit right on your ears (they hurt and really hurt if you wear glasses); the boom mike feels very cheap and the ratcheting when you move it up and down is really annoying; noise cancellation not that great.So for the money I think there are better headsets out there.  I really can't wear this headset for any extended period of time (like for grading video assignments).  I'm going to try to find another of the same Microsoft model because I'm only going to use this until the end of the fall term.
3,I thought I'd like these but was disappointed having cheapened out on the model. Borrowing my brother in laws for work I got quickly spoiled using his. It was sleek and easy. The noise cancelling was perfect. The mic arm when positioned up automatically muted itself and when reversed back into position took mute off. This one wasn't as great with cancelling out noise and the mic arm is clunky and doesn't have the mute feature. You have to press on and off to mute. The ear covers are ok but again not as nice as the upgrade
5,I felt the need to review because there were wildly varing reviews out there and I almost didn't purchase these.  I own 3 varieties of BOSE headphones and I needed to get a new headset with a USB connection since my work laptop is broken in that I can hear web calls but not speak.  I'll address some conflicting reviews that I found to be bunk:Comfort - I'm usually not a fan of on-ear headsets but these are padded and comfy.  They aren't too light as to slip off nor are they heavy or bulky.  One reviewer said the cord and control circle (volume and mute) was so heavy as to drag the headphones off his head ...  totally untrue.  The cord is very long - you can slide over to your file cabinet or printer - yay.  And the cord is NOT heavy as to feel its weight on that side of the headset.Sound - The sound is excellent and as I mentioned I'm a BOSE girl.  There are so many USB headsets in the $39 - $79 range and I'm glad I spent the extra dollars for this price point.  Working from home in the COVID age means a lot more WebEx and Zoom meetings and sound - and noise cancellation - has to be excellent.  One reviewer said she could hear herself breathing.  That only happens when the mouthpiece is aimed at your nostril - duh.  Move it.I can't comment on longevity as these are new but hopefully these will have a nice long usage life.
5,I bought these for my fiancé as a gift and she loves them. Excellent sound great microphone. She uses them for her business calls and even video conferences on her laptop. When it came time to buy headphones for myself and my iPhone without a plug port I purchased the bluetooth version. If you can swing the extra expense buy the bluetooth wireless if not this is an excellent product. Highly recommend.
2,Mic sounds good audio sounds good.A user complained that the cable gets twisted. Trying to find a solution to this I noticed that the cable to the headset was keyed so you can not just untwist the cable where it plugs into the USB puck. This also means that you can not use standard usb extension cables and you can not use other headsets with the USB puck that comes in this package only Jabra Evolve headsets.If you want standard audio devices do not buy this one. If you just want a decent usb headset that you can also use for your cell phone (with an audio jack) this may work well.But It is not what I need. Fortunately I only bought 2 before I realized this problem not 40.
4,I liked the headset but the mute light stopped working after a couple of weeks. Good sound.
3,With the headset adjusted to the longest length it just barely fits over my ears. If i wear a hat then they wont fit right over my ears. Ideally they should have made these just a little bit longer when fully adjusted.
5,This was a replacement from the previous one I had. Best investment. Volume control is pretty good. Never have issues when answering calls for work.
5,The dual headset presents great sound quality while the noise cancelling microphone blocks out household noises. Not one issue with the other party cutting out or with them not being able to hear me. All around a purchase well worth it.
4,I got mine refurbished and got a great price. I'm remote (like everyone else) working on hardware and virtual machines and was always losing Bluetooth connection so I switched to these. Working good.
3,I don’t hate the Jabra Evolve 40. I also don’t really like it. The only reason I’m still using it all is for some variety. It’s main issue is that it’s just too small for my large head. It was only really usable at all after I broke it in like you would a baseball glove or something like that. I had it wrapped around a large box to stretch it out overnight. Now it fits over my head with popping itself off.Now I accept and acknowledge that I have a large head. It is not however obscene nor am I a mutant with some out of proportioned giant melon. My Bose QC 35 II fits just fine over my noggin. Jabra simply failed to make this thing large enough for folks with large heads. The band is too curved and the ear cups don’t extend out far enough to be long enough to reach my ears comfortably.The other defect is the red LED on the mic mute button. When I join a zoom meeting I join with my audio muted. The headset definitely thinks I’m not though. So the first thing I do when joining a meeting with this thing is hit the mute button twice to get it in sync with the actual mute in Zoom. After that it works fine.Overall the audio quality in my ears is fine. Other people say I sound fine but I haven’t recorded and listened back. The ear pieces actually have a surprising amount of sound isolation. It’s not really sound isolating by definition but still surprising.
3,These seemed to work really well. I would have occasional audio issues however my company uses a soft phone system so I believe that’s where most of my audio issues came from. Restarting the program always worked.The mic worked well. I could hear my dog bark on the recording once (he’s not a barker) but it wasn’t very loud and he was close by. Settings make a difference and it’s possible my settings somehow changed to 80% noise canceling instead of the mute all other sounds setting.I would love to test that better however after having for only 9 months the ear piece broke while I was working. I was careful with my headset and it never left my home office. They hung on my desk every day. I only used them 4 hours a day for part-time work. I’m so disappointed! I really like these headphones.I was looking to upgrade to the Jabra Engage 50 but now I’m not so sure Jabra is a quality product. For the price I need them to last years not months.
5,I got it on 7/09/2022. Thank you.
4,It's good very good in fact. That said this new Jabra headset replaced a similar Jabra headset that I've had in use for 9 years. I'm all for progress but the old one was better - it was much lighter more comfortable and had a snazzy rotary volume dial you could play with during boring meetings and calls.
4,As someone who spends 4-6 hours a day on the phone I've tried just about every headset on the market.  I've been using the same Plantronics Audio 478 for the past few years because it was so comfortable affordable and had great sound quality.  My mute button stopped working so I was forced to try a new headset.I ordered the Jabra Evolve 40 with realistic expectations that I may not love it.  To my surprise this headset turned out much better than I had expected.The good:- Really good mic audio quality- No annoying side tone being looped back into my ears like other manufacturers do (Plantronics)- Good build quality- USB or 3.5mm connectivityThe bad:- The leatherette ear pads block out ambient noise in a way that makes you feel a little claustrophobic.- The way the boom mic is attached to the headset is a little weird.  Also it's really loose and makes a ton of noise if you try to rotate it or adjust it while on a call.- The sound quality of the headset speakers are mediocre at best.  This is common for business related headset and I'm not surprised..but I hope for better.Conclusion:This headset provides a decent value and I'm mostly happy with my purchase.  For the money you can't go wrong.
5,Bought this back in July 2021 and it is now broken.  It is a great headset but it is not one that is long-lasting as it is made with cheap material it seems as the ear piece just broke off
2,Headset works well but the USB dongle failed after a month or two. I still use it but shopping for a new set because without the dongle the wire is only about 3 feet long and this makes it too short for my setup - a real limitation while I am working.
5,I bought one to use on a referal from another in our business.  I liked it so well that we are all three using them and I have an extra for back up.  Sound is not always great on VPN connections and these help.
2,So I purchased this because I work at home and wanted something to show my kids when I’m in the phone and when I’m not. The indicator light on the ear piece stopped working the first day. I didn’t even make it through an 8 hr shift. The headphones still work just not the light. Would not recommend if that is why your getting it!
4,I really needed a new headset for work. Primary focus is conference calls using Skype though I occasionally listen to music or watch videos.I really wanted something lightweight with a reversible mic boom (to use left- or right-sided). I was looking primarily for voice quality and noise cancelling (I hate seeming like a mouth-breather). I wanted something conducive to packing up and traveling. I wanted an actual headset and not an earpiece. I wanted something that approached - or met - these goals while not breaking the bank.These are far from the cheapest and far from the best. However they represent a good intersection of my criteria. They aren't the best sound quality. They come with a case (with a small foam insert to help avoid them breaking) for travel. The boom swings such that it can be left/right. It (bonus) has the headphone jack.I'm pleased and if the description sounds like it will meet your needs you will likely be happy with these headphones. If you require a high performance in any area - sound quality travel/compactness value price point - these probably aren't for you. They're likable middle-ground "my porridge is just right".
4,I got this particular headset because it was recommended by a reviewer as one to use with the Dragon voice recognition software. Although not inexpensive it does the job very well and I’ve been impressed with voice recognition right out of the box perhaps in part due to this good-quality headset.My one criticism is that there is a volume control module roughly halfway up the cord and this bit of weight and bulk is an awkward place. This design would not keep me from buying it again but I do suggest taping (or otherwise affixing) that controller to your desk because it is otherwise constantly tugging and causing physical interference. The court is plenty long enough to allow for this.
5,I've always been and still is a fan of wired products (direct Ethernet connection VS WiFi etc) and my current headsets  were starting to form a crackling/static sound every so often.  I avoid frequency interruptions by sticking to wired products.  I read many reviews on a wired replacement.  Once I connected these headsets I noticed an immediate improvement in performance.  The sound from the headsets was much more pronounced; the sound from my mic was cleaner.  The fit was much better than my previous headset!  The cushioned ear piece is very comfortable.  My exiting Plantronics headsets were uncomfortable after long webex/zoom sessions.  I do not experience that with the Jabra's.  They actually disappear on my head as though I don't have any headset on.  The crazy thing is that I paid double for my prior headsets.  These headsets are a great purchase.
4,These have been fantastic headphones for the last 5 months. Then one day the volume control and mute stopped working. Now I have to unplug them or manually click the mute button on my calls. Not ideal since that feature was used daily.
3,I am borderline deaf in one ear so the sound quality for me was less than ideal.  Unfortunately the headset i received started to malfunction within a week of receipt.  I can hear a ring tone that indicates the sound is dropping like when the chord starts to go back i.e. you have to keep it in a certain position in order for it to work.  Very disappointing.  I will be returning and looking for something else.
5,I am impressed that my laptop recognizes it right away when plugging it in no special settings runs right out of the box.  The controls are easy to use and understand.  I have even been using the headset with my cell phone for hands free talking.  Really great for when you have to talk and type or write notes.  Great in Teams Zoom and other meetings no audio feed back at all to the meetings.
5,The headphones come in super fast and are great! The sound quality is top notch.
5,So I bought these and immediately tried to use Amazon Music to test out the sound quality. My experience was the sound would work well for 20-30 seconds then switch to very low quality with no low-end and flip back and forth between bad and good quality sometimes never switching back to good. I called Jabra support and they were very helpful but we didn't come to a root cause.I sent these back and received a new pair they did the same thing.I noticed in the system tray while testing sound there was a microphone icon that said 'Cisco Webex Meetings is using your microphone'.  Long story short when Cisco Webex Meetings is using your microphone it seems to affect the quality of the headphones.I don't know if this is an issue with the headset or not but I feel like it's a windows issue caused by Webex.
4,These are great.  Even greater for the price.I do At-Home sales work primarily in an open air environment - a porch with open screened windows from top to nearly bottom - so the noise cancelling microphone was my primary concern.  It's flawless.  I constantly have cars noisy golf carts garbage trucks etc. going past me 25 feet away and not once has any caller noticed.Audio quality was less of a concern for me but is superb for phone calls.  I use the USB connection for Skype calls almost exclusively and I couldn't be happier.  The handful of times I have used the headset with my cell the audio quality was also fine and any issues I had were due to an older cell phone model and/or lousy wireless connection not the headset.Two very minor issues prevented me from giving 5 stars.  (1) the wires are very stiff and inflexible.  It sometimes makes it difficult to get the volume/mute button placement just right on a desk or table and the wires do not adjust well to relatively small head and body movements.  It's annoying to reach for a paper and have the volume control fall to the floor.  (2) The adjustable microphone is a little loose and could stay in place better.  It's not bad just an occasional minor nuisance.Overall I am extremely pleased with the purchase.
3,I've been using this headset in my home office for a few months now. Here are my thoughts: - The headband does not stretch out very far. I don't have a large head but I have these things pulled out to the max and they barely fit perfectly.-  The headband is constructed from a hard material so they are fairly uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. The ear pads are really nice though and there is no discomfort from those. It's just that stupid headband.-  I like others here sometimes hear a weird buzzing or popping sound on calls. I call through Gmail and thought that was the problem but it happens on Zoom and other online calling systems.-  They really look nice. The little disk that sits on my desk is heavy enough that it doesn't slide around much. I typically use the call controls from whatever program I'm running (mute volume etc) so the disk is probably not even necessary for me but that's okay.-  If they would have made the band a little longer and given it some decent padding I would say this is a terrific product. Even the buzzing noise occasionally wouldn't ruin that impression.My overall recommendation - if you need a headset that stretches out a little bit or if you don't like pain on the top of your head after a few hours avoid this product. If you can live with either of those things it's a nice design.
4,The headset comes with standard 3.5mm stereo headset jack and USB sound card with volume control and very useful travel pouch.Works really well with and without the USB sound card - in windows 710 and Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 openSuse 15.xThe USB sound card does not need any drivers in Linux - it is completely hassle free.Windows might need to install a driver in my case it happened auto-magically.I wish the cable would be softer and 1" longer - for this alone I would recommend the cheaper Evolve-20 headset.The bad - the headphone 3.5mm jack connector on the USB sound card is mechanically keyed so it does not accept different headphone jack. This is nasty it spoils and reduces value of otherwise excellent product. Who in .. thought that this is good feature for any customer.
4,Overall a nice set of headphones. Don’t really get a big noise canceling reduction with them on. What I like least about these headphones is the hard plastic for the microphone. I wish it was able to bend and be manipulated to where you want your microphone to sit.
2,They work but they sit poorly on top of my ears. There is nothing form fitting about them. I looked like a fool wearing them on a zoom call. Hard pass.
4,This headset was very comfortable and headband was not too tight or too loose. The sound was good for the short time I used it. The issue I had was it caused my camera to have feedback when I used the USB plug in. The bottom half of my image was distorted the whole time. I tried using just with the 3.5mm plugin but the mic was loud enough. Since I wanted to use this for Teams and WebEx meetings they will not serve the purpose. Shame as they were very comfortable and perfect otherwise.
5,I use my headset exclusively for Skype and WebEx calls through my Windows 10 laptop.I've tried at least five other headsets and it's always the same: sound quality sucks. Not with this one! Everybody I talk to can hear me crystal clear I can hear them without any sort of distortion or muffling or whatever. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that I can hear myself in the earpieces with zero delay. Most other headsets I've tried use VOIP through the earpiece so it's like calling into a radio show and leaving your radio volume turned up.Things I like:1. The microphone sits far enough away from my mouth that other callers don't hear me breathing.2. The control pad for volume/mute/answer/hang up sits flat on the desk in easy reach. A short tone plays for each button press.3. Integration with my Windows 10 laptop was plug & play no downloads or installs.4. Switching between "listen through the laptop speakers" and "listen through the headset" is a simple mouseclick on the volume icon in the system tray.5. Headset itself is comfortable. Time will tell if it hurts my ears during long calls (my expectation is that it will but I'm ready for that.Thanks Jabra!!!
4,The Jabra Evolve 40 UC is a wired headset basic yet better quality. I use quite a few different types of Jabra products so I know this headset will be pretty good. The Evolve 40 is perfect for Microsoft Teams and Zoom meetings. The MIC is useable picks up echo at times. However even the best headsets do that.I would only use this for business use nothing more! The ear cups are reasonably comfortable for long periods of use but not all day in one sitting.  The price is tad high but again its backed by a good manufacturer.
5,am purchasing for all my staff
3,This headset was great while it workred. Unfortunately it died 2 monthhs after purchasing and I could not return to MAazon. $80 down the drain.
5,I've been working from home since March and am on the phone throughout the day. In the past when working remotely for a day or two I've just used my laptop's built-in mic and speakers but for long-term use I wanted something better. This has worked great with 8x8 letting me answer calls or hang up with the push of a button. If I put a call on hold the dongle flashes while they're on hold. It works great with Zoom also. If I mute my mic in the Zoom app it activates the mute light on the dongle as well. Sound quality has been great (listening and microphone) and even when we had work on the exterior of the house it wasn't picking up the outside noise. It's also been comfortable to wear all day (did take me a day or two to get used to it).
5,I noticed a colleague had a headset that was easy to hear her and limited her background noise (dogs and babies) - so asked about the comfort and if she would recommend it - yes.  Especially for the cost it is simply perfect for my needs.  I host meetings for work as well as provide trainings so hearing me and keeping outside noise for me out has been a 'gamechanger'.  For the price the ear pieces are very comfortable the boom mic can be switched from right to left side (important for me) and you can turn up or down the volume easily from the cord (so no need to reach forward for the keyboard-mouse to turn down or up volume from the computer's settings).
2,I did quite a bit of research before deciding which headset to purchase for use with Zoom calls. This Jabra Evolve 40 UC was highly rated by multiple sources including the NY Times Wirecutter whom have never steered me wrong. At about $100 this product seemed a bit pricey but I am on Zoom calls all day for work at home and felt it was worth the investment. As soon as I unpacked the headset plugged it in and made a phone call I heard static noise. I checked to make sure the 3.5 mm jack was fully inserted and when I moved the wire attached to the jack the noise changed or went away. It appears there is a defect in the way the wire attaches to the 3.5 mm jack (please view attached image). In addition to this defect right out of the box (poor quality control in my opinion does Jabra test these at the factory?) the entire headset has a low quality 'cheap' feel to it. In this age of technology we've all had many electronic products and accessories. This Jabra Evolve 40 UC feels substandard to me just does not have the look or feel of a high quality electronic product. Frankly I don't hear much difference between this $103 item and my Samsung earbuds that came with my S10 smartphone as far as quality of sound when used on a call. I'm going to have to rethink what is the best way to go with a headset for Zoom calls.
5,I bought this headset for use in my work-from-home setup. My main interest was in blocking out noise so people on the other end wouldn't hear the random background sounds in my home. I just tested it out with a loud jackhammer being used outside and with my computer's sound recorder. When I played it back I couldn't hear the jackhammer at all. I haven't tested it with different kinds of sounds and I assume it doesn't do as well with treble-heavy noise (noise-rejection mics tend to do best with bass) but I have tried a lot of different microphones and this is one of the best.
5,These are amazing! I’ve bought so many headphones over this last year since I work from home now and couldn’t find one that works for what I need either they couldn’t hear me there was so much static or I sounded like a robot. I finally did my research and found that these were rated #1 top of the line headphones for working from home! I literally just for them today and I didn’t want to clock out lol I wanted to keep working. They are amazing! I absolutely love how small they are too! Most of my headsets are huge and bulky which I don’t like. It’s definitely worth the price point!
5,I have worked from home for the past 7 years and find Jabra to be the best noise cancellation headphones.  The sound quality is perfect and the volume controls is comfortable to useThey are very comfortable to wear and don't cause pressure on my ears. This is my second set. I love the magnetic microphone holder that keeps the boom out of the way when I am charting.The orange cord detaches from the controller and can be used with any cell phone which is a nice feature. I would definitely recommend these headphones.
5,Works great with gaming!
2,Comfortable headset and microphone works great but the ear piece is not loud enough. Even with all volumes on high I still struggled to hear customers.  Great noise cancelation though. I live on a farm and customers couldn't hear the critters.
2,I bought this headset only a year ago and took good care of it but it started to randomly disconnect during crucial meetings. I can't have this happening and cannot rely on these headphones anymore. Waste of money for such an expensive headset.
5,Great headset.  Solid build and works with my cordless Polycom D60 handset.
5,I am in video meetings (like most people) all the time.  These are exactly what I wanted: comfortable with great sound quality.
5,Feedback is they can't tell I'm talking on a headset.  I'm on the phone a lot with business and this works perfectly for what I was needing.  I have used several headsets in the past and the overall feedback was the same "it's not too bad but I can tell you're on a headset" not so with this one.  I went with just the one ear so I could still hear things around me if I needed to.  I highly recommend this headset to anyone who spends a lot of time on the phone it's comfortable and your ear does not get hot if you wear it for long periods of time
3,I bought these headsets 3 weeks ago and I got disappointed. I chose them because of their brand I really expected more from Jabra. The first thing I disliked was the poor audio quality when I connected them to my computer by using the USB connection even at the highest volume level so I definitely decided don't use that USB connector and that means to lose the functionality of change volume or mute the microphone by using the USB control buttons (busy light functionality lost as well).  Even connecting the headsets by using the 3.5 millimeter jack the audio quality is still poor it's better than the USB connector but I need to use them at the highest volume level no matter if I am on a call or if I am listening music or watching a video my old phone headsets has a better audio quality than these and I got them for free when I bought my phone 4 years ago!
2,I tried this headset because it was suggested in a list by Interprefy. The microphone sound is better than the other ones  I have but it is muffled and uncomfortable. I need to hear well when interpreting but also hear myself and feel comfortable wearing the headset for long periods of time. I had a couple of RSI assignments and tested the product. Unfortunately it was disappointing. I had to switch back to one that cost a third of the price and worked better. I have to add that my voice sounded clearer to the client so that would be a plus if I could wear it.
5,Alright so I'm headed out to travel and need to be on conference calls. I did research to look for a high quality headphone and microphone combination (since I use a Blue Yeti USB mic at home which sits on my desk). Didn't feel like breaking the bank and wanted something that had great audio quality on the mic. I didn't care as much about the headphone quality...Anyway that's exactly what I got with these Jabra Evolve 40 Headphones. I watched a YouTube video that showed how well they cancel out environment noise (does a really great job) and the voice quality is pretty dang good. Not Blue Yeti dynamic quality but it picks up voice great and has a nice range.Honestly the headphones are better than I expected though. Think high quality earbuds but they're over the ear ones. Like other reviews mention they don't cancel noise at all. I don't mind that at all though. Just turn your volume up and don't worry about it is my take on that. They're also not that comfortable. Although it's more important to me that the mic quality is good and helps cut down on environment noise. This is the perfect package to accomplish that and still be mobile.Any questions please post a comment. Thanks!
4,These work great for the cost. The sound quality and noise cancellation is good. I like the integration with MS Teams for quickly muting and answering calls.
1,Bought these on a NYT Wirecutter rec and deeply regret. They physically fell apart a few months shy of 2 years of light office use. Since both earpieces are on a swivel the point of connection is a very small circle of plastic. This broke on one side and shortly thereafter broke on the right side while I inspected it to figure out how to fix. Worse I couldn't even super glue or tape them back together since the point of contact is tiny and raised away from larger pieces.Secondly the over the ear style was painful after hours of Zoom sessions. The microphone would swing down when I didn't want it to (a weak magnet is supposed to keep it up when not in use). The USB mute/volume controller would only work with Windows 10 and Zoom half the time. And the audio quality was middling.
5,This is exactly what we've been looking for. It is used at a home business/job. It works better than any other we've used over the years.
4,Good but definitely expensive. Cable length is a bit too long.
5,I think this is a solid buy for the price. It does everything “well” but not extremely well. Ergonomics are certainly acceptable and I don’t have issues with ear pain as some have mentioned even after two hours. The microphone can be swung up and out of the way so you can eat or drink while wearing them a nice feature for anyone who works during lunch.The in-line remote is actually very handy and I like how it has non-skid foam on the bottom. The functions on the remote work perfectly with Skype — hoping that Teams gets updated to use them too.I didn’t really buy these for music so I can’t comment on sound quality but voices are clear and crisp. The passive noise canceling is kinda BS...they block noise by simply pressing against your ear which any headphone does. Still the microphone is positioned well to not pick up a ton of background noise.
2,I had a Lenovo set that looks exactly the same as these.  And even on the Lenovo's headset it says sound by Jabra.  So one of the ear pieces fell off the Lenovo's and I need it for work so I went with these expecting to find the same quality.  I did not.  Sound quality for listening to Music is worthless while the Lenovo ones are perfect.  I only went with these because the Lenovo's is on back order at the moment.  For work they get the job done.  But even my team I talk with noticed my voice sounded completely different and the Noise Cancellation is not as good.  These are being returned.
3,Doesn’t cancel out any noise. Everything else is fine.
5,I use a computer at work and can easily field phone calls with this headset by pressing the phone button on the round part of the connection cable.  It is very clear and makes my job easier.
5,Price and audio quality are great.
3,For the price quality is bad it feels like a cheap 1dollar….. headset I wish the sound was louder  Can’t  turn volume up to high the mic drops feels like cheap plastic afraid I’m going to brake it other then that it clear and works and can hear back rounds for home office
5,Great mircophone quality which does not pickup background noise. You will sound like a radio presenter on all your calls. The headphones sound good on calls and are very comfortable for all day use. The headphones will not compete with top end HiFI headphones but that is not their purpose. The USB gadget for muting and volume control is really well done and easy to use.The only problem with them is if you leave them in the office and then work from home for a week.
5,I've been using a Microsoft Lifechat and a similar Logitech model at home and at work and they were fine.  When one of them broke I decided to buy this is a replacement.  I was hesitant because it is so much more expensive than other models.  I've been using it for a week now and I'm glad I got this it's a big improvement over what I was using.  Here's why:- The headset is lightweight and very comfortable.- The audio quality is great much better than what I was using both for me and for the people I'm talking to.- The headset has both a USB and an audio connector so I can use it both with my laptop and with my phone.- I use this with Skype for Business a lot.  With my previous headsets the mute button on the headset worked independently of the Skype app.  With this headset the mute button on the headset controller integrates with Skype which I find to be extremely convenient.
5,I use the headphone 8 hours a day and they are comfortable these are my second pair the first pair lasted me 4 years but the leather started to come apart so I had to get some new ones. The sound is crystal clear and I never had an issue with customers not being able to hear me.
4,I buy a lot of these for the users in our open office. Overall they are excellent good sound quality both transmitting and receiving easy to use (just enough controls to be useful) and comfortable. A very good value at around $90 and sometimes cheaper. The ability to connect via USB OR 3.5mm has been very useful in our environment where people switch from the laptop to a cell phone frequently. However new androids and iPhones no longer have a 3.5mm port which forces us to use adapters. There is a relatively high percentage of users who simply can't seem to keep track of small connectors.Would love to see a version of this with a USB type-C connector (at the same price point).
5,I bought these to use while teaching my “hybrid” high school classes through Google Meet. Google included this model on a list of headphones that work best with Meet. My students were thrilled with the improvement in the quality of my voice and the canceling of the noise from air cleaners in my classroom. I can hear them much more clearly too. These are comfortable even after hours of wearing. I’ve started using them with other videoconferencing platforms and the experience is similarly excellent.
2,I connect the USB and press the buttons but audio does not come through or mic.
4,The volume can’t be turned up higher than a certain limit. I wish you could
2,No need to add a photo.  It looks like it came out of the box.  Used for at home job.  Bought in Feb.  began work mid March.  Dead on April 26 the same year.  May want to try something else beside Jabra.  Also some customers complained they couldn’t hear at times and sounded faint.
4,A solid headset. Does the job. A bit in the pricey side. Better than my old plant Ronice with foam earphones that disintegrated.
5,Bought these for my husband after trying multiple other brands/types. Cordless and/or Bluetooth always seem to give issues so went with the good ol’ corded pair. Sound and comfort are five stars! The mic could be a bit longer so it’s not right in front of my loud husband- he moves it up or down a bit which causes it to be a bit short if that makes sense.
2,I've used this headset for about 3 months and am pretty disappointed.  First the volume is VERY low.  I have the volume set to 100% and still have trouble hearing on some calls.  I really need it to get at least another 20% louder.Second it will occasionally just disconnect from my computer mid call and I have to unplug it from USB and plug it back in to reconnect.  Very annoying.I definitely expected better quality from Jabra.  As a plus it is comfortable to wear for long stretches but not much else to recommend beyond that.
2,I find this headset to be comfortable for all day use. However that would be my only Pro. My patients are constantly says they are unable to hear me. I have the volume on 100. Some of the calls are extremely staticky. These are the required headset of my employer since changing our software. The company did provided me a new pair of Jabra headphones. But they are Not Mono & I can't have both off my ears covered. So I had to invest in my own. I really tried to work with these. But I have to find a better option. I need to have efficient work equipment.
5,The quality is much better than cheap headsets youd get from work. The ear muffs are comfortable and clear. My mic works well but can only move a little bit away from the face or closer to the face so it's not too flexible there. The middle control hub is nice and works well.The only issue is the 3.5 mic connection to the control hub; its loose and if moved will cause a loss of sound. As long as you arent moving or pulling on the cord too much you'll be fine.
5,This product definitely lives up to its description. I am always online and have had a hard time finding a headset that not only provides comfort but clarity. This headset did that and more. I have recommended it to all of my workmates.
2,While the headset fits pretty well for a cheap design there are a couple noticeable problems.1. The dongle is pretty heavy which causes it to pull on one ear.  On my previous model it was much lighter.2. Buttons are not tactile as my previous Jabra was.  You physically have to look at the buttons every time or risk hitting the wrong one.3.  The microphone can only be positioned up and down you can't bend it farther away from your face.4.  The mute light is very hard to see.  The mute on/off beep is reverse of the light.  I.e. mute on = light but a "off" beep.  Takes a little getting used to when you can't see the light well.  But then again since the buttons aren't tactile you'll be looking at it anyway.On the positive side1. The noise cancellation seems pretty good though it does pick up my computer noises still.2. The comments about hearing breathing I find to be easily solved by just putting the mic lower by your chin.  My previous Jabra had a foam cover to the mic which solved the breathing problem a little more foolproof but this one seems fine.3. The wire is of a better quality than my previous Jabra as best I can tell after a full week of use.  That is about the only improvement.  The failure of the wire after 3 years of use is why I had to fine a new headset in the first place.
3,Really light weight sounds and mic are great controls are easy.. then it died. It lasted about 1 hour of use and went dead. Tried several PCs and nothing.Now we will see what ÀLACART's replacement process is like. Their terms don't make it look like this will go well and I wish I would have read them before hand. Will edit once the replacement process plays out.
4,I use this headset frequently for conference calls.  The audio quality is good and the headset is fairly comfortable.  The only problem I have is that at 3ft the headphone cable is way too short.  This is the part that connects the actual headphones to the controller.  It has a proprietary connector (standard stereo plug but with 2 flat sides) which helps prevent accidental disconnects.  But since it's short it gives very limited mobility while on calls and due to the proprietary connector it can't be extended.  Otherwise it's a very good set.
4,Sound is good but it pulls my hair.  My hair gets tangled with this one.  It did not happen with my old dead head set that was the same brand
4,Had difficulty making myself heard with this headset specifically when the client was using the conference call phone. Others (using headsets) for the call could hear me clearly but overall I found myself shouting to be heard in the conference room. The next headset purchased (a Plantronics) seemed to work well and resolve the issue. In general I could hear clearly with the Jabra Evolve and appreciated the long cord. However the headset didn't seem to plug in securely to the USB. Not sure whether that was affecting the headset's performance.
4,Audio and build quality are awesome. Only complaint is that the headband is very smooth plastic which allows them to slip around.
5,The quality of this product surpassed my expectations! Noise  cancellation volume control and sound quality are outstanding. I would definitely recommend it.
1,Without a doubt wearing a pot on my head all day would be more comfortable than these unusual headphones.  It's not possible to wear these for more than a minute until you audibly gasp from the way they slide around your ear and kind of canter themselves out of position every time you move your head.The audio quality is seemingly fine its a comfort thing for me.  The lack of adjustability with the mic and the way these feel on the ear have finally convinced me that I needed to warn the masses.These headphones are 1-star & certified hard-no.
3,The nose cancelation feature in the mic doesn't work as well as it claims. It picks up a lot of background noise that shouldn't be picked up.  It's very comfortable. I wish I would have purchased the flexible mic version. This one tests against my face. I do enjoy how light this model suits on my head though. For the price the product is awesome. Going back  I would have splurged on a bit more expensive mic with some nicer features.  Cause now I've spent money on thisand I'll STILL be buying another mic in the near future.
5,The sound quality excellent. I listen to music between calls. I recorded myself and the mic is really good I sounded cristal clear. And I love the mute button on this thing. And you can connect via USB or 3.5mm Jack. The cable is pretty long so I can move around while talking. I don't fell attached to the desk. 100% reccomended
4,I have been using this for individual Zoom calls as well as volunteer activities on telephone. The sound quality is excellent.  However after a few hours it is less comfortable. Has 2 connections prong and USB.  Definitely a good deal.
3,I have to wear my head phones for a long period of time as much as 5-6 hours at a time.  After about 2 hours these are really hurting my ears.  There is not enough padding on them so you can feel the hard surface under what little padding is there.
5,I love these headphones. They are so comfortable and my clients can hear me clearly and I can hear them with no issues. Headphones plug and play on my Mac and Windows. Will even work on an iPhone with the USB-C to audio jack adapter. This is a must have product if you make calls to clients.
5,I use this every day for work! It works great with both my cell phones (I have an Android for personal use and an iPhone for work use) and I haven't had any issues with call quality. I generally have to repeat myself multiple times over the phone because I have a soft voice but the microphone on the headset is great and since starting to use it I have not had one complaint from anyone not being able to hear me. The headset itself is a little big for me even on the smallest setting but I have a small head so I'm used to that. I love that the microphone folds up and secures to the headset so you can use these as normal headphones when not on a call. I struggle with ear buds (tiny head=tiny ears) so having this cushioned over-the-ear set is a huge relief.
3,Microphone is great: my voice is loud and clear and it doesn't pick up little sounds like typing or my air conditioned blasting behind me.  The position is adjustable but it feel flimsy and I'm expecting it to break someday but I'm not above supergluing things.  Comfort is above average.  They look kinda goofy (maybe it's just me).Biggest problem is that the red cable has a hefty 3mm diameter and is really stiff.  I can NOT get the twists out of it (see pic).  Try to untwist and it warps the other way.  It looks ridiculous and cheap on video calls and is driving me crazy.  So I'm taking one star off for that.
3,The headset sound quality is good but less than 2 months after i received it the cloth cover has started seperating from the plastic on the right ear.  Beyond the return date and vendor has not replied to my email about a possible warranty.
3,i used the product for Zoom. Voice clarity  both hearing and speaking was very good.  The problem is that  the unit kept moving off my ear.  It is too much of a bother to wear. i plan to return it and now have to look for something of similar voice quality that will stay put
1,bought these in April for a work from home job that requires me to be on the phone for long stretches of the day. I'm calling people constantly. Been having sound issues off an on since I starting working and have tried everything under the sun with Vonage with my WiFi with my phone plan but now months later in August I have finally discovered the culprit: this headset.Sound on the other end cuts in and out and I've been told I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Problems are consistent and unrelenting. Sometimes I could make it work but never without hearing at least one sound complaint on the other end. Discussed the issues with my supervisor and she suggested I unplug my headset and try using speakerphone... and BOOM! no sound problems. Not a single one.It's the headset and if you buy it it will negatively affect your work performance and cause you HOURS of unnecessary stress and frustration trying and failing to find the source of your sound woes. I don't know if mine was defective out of the box or it's just a crappy product but I absolutely can't recommend it on my experience and definitely not if you have to rely on it for work. I repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS FOR WORK.
5,Since there are folks around me at work I moved away from using my desk speaker/microphone unit (Jabra 710 - which is great btw) and purchased these to help me with both call privacy and keeping my voice down while on calls.These work great and interact well with Slack Teams and Zoom for muting and volume.  Occasionally Zoom thinks I am muted when these do not but that is very rare.
5,The headset is light and the mute volume and phone and computer connection/control is awesome! I have conducted coaching sessions and been on pod cast using this headset. All participants have commented on how clear my voice sounds. It is amazing on how much clarity is gained when using these headphones. I would highly recommend someone who seeks clarity when being heard to buy these headphones.
2,Purchased March of 2021 and used every workday while working from home. It started to crap out in January 2022 and by April 2022 it won't work anymore. It was great while it lasted it's just that it's really expensive to not work after 1 year.
2,They are comfortable. That’s about it in terms of positives. I have audio issues that require me to reboot or disconnect the headset daily. Did not experience this with other headsets and same computer. It’s like the device goes to sleep becomes unrecognized and audio stops working. Have tried updates and nothing works. Very annoying. The audio for Teams is very different from something else like a recording and I’m constantly having to lower the volume when I switch out of Teams. Cord is also a pain because I’m chained to my desk. Would not buy again.One of the ear pieces has broken off after 4 months. Not worth it.
4,Very happy with my Jabra Evolve 40 UC Stereo Headset.  I use it alternately with my laptop or my smartphone.  Comfortable much easier to hear others and no complaints anymore about volume or clarity of my own voice on the call with attendees (often in WebEx events and equivalent).  Tried many other headsets and mic setups before I invested in these.  Super pleased the conversation has moved past call quality to focus on the discussion at hand.  Can use them for work or leisure (just swing the mic arm up parallel with the band over head and it's out of the way).  Like the reliability in this wired headset; haven't found a wireless solution as consistent.  No regrets.  Would buy them again.
4,I liked the ambient noise cancellation. Not that great but works for me. $100 is worth for the value. I bought 2 one for me and one for my wife. Both are working from home!!
4,Pros.Very good quality in general love the volume control. The audio quality is very good for conversations.Very comfortables.Cons.There is no easy usb connector you must bring all the control in order to connect to USB port.The mute function just moving the microphone in to the up position is no really muting the sound it just reduce the mic volumen but still active.
3,These are high quality headphones - very lightweight comfortable easy to setup and use. BUT there was one BIG problem for me so I am returning them. In short when using the headphones you do not hear your voice through the headphones. In other words you hear a muffled voice.  Strangely when you play a recording back your voice is clear as day through the headphones. I called Jabra and they said it was related to the OS system on the mac and this model. When I checked with a colleague she had the same experience so she bought a higher level Jabra that works the way it should!
4,I purchased the Evolve 40 UC for office use. We're constantly on web conferences where we dial in via voice over IP but we also use our cell phones quite often. The headset works well and provides great sound and noise cancelling especially via the Mic which was critical for us as we have multiple people in close proximity on conference calls. The only issue with this model is that it does not have any controls on the device itself when using the 3.5mm jack. There is a control unit but that's only for when you're using the USB method. That can be an issue when taking a conference call via cell phone and constantly having to unlock screen to mute/un-mute.
5,It is a little more expensive than other unknown products but momey worth. I use it for work and the product is great. Only thing it is a little tight not sure because it is new or my head is big.
5,I am currently working in an office that can get very loud and my Jabra Motion Office bluetooth earpiece wasn't isolating enough to be able to hear properly. This provides FAR better isolation with sound coming in both on-ear pieces. Isolation for both the earphones and the mike is passive and very good. The mike is directional and only picks up on what you're saying. Some people have said that they can't stop the sound of their breathing into it but I can't say I've had that issue yet. The controls work well and the bright orange cord and activity light make it clear that you are busy to even the most obtuse visitor.Also considered a bluetooth version of this from Plantronics but figured it wasn't worth twice the price to me.
5,Excellent—feels substantial but not too heavy and not like all the cheapo headsets I had gotten from work. Works flawlessly and doesn’t hurt my ears after 10 straight hours of work calls. This is my second Jabra purchase and they keep delivering so I’ll keep buying!
5,I use my cell phone quite a bit when working from home.  Over the last year I must have gone through 5 different sets and they all disappointed me.  On some the sound quality through the single or dual head phones was crappy.  On others the head phones were ok but the mike was lousy with people complaining about the sound quality of me speaking.After a year of searching and returning a number of pairs these are ABSOLUTELY the best I've found.  Sound as heard through the headphones in stereo is top notch and people on the other end comment that the sound quality was excellent.  And very comfortable to wear.I would highly highly recommend them for anyone needing a high quality headset.
1,Bought first one in January 2020 was happy with sound and microphone quality but had one of the sides broken in March if 2021. Thought it was an accident and I might have twisted it an intentionally and since overall it worked fine before breaking bought another one if same model right away. And after 14 month having the same exact issue. This time for sure will not blame myself as know that was using it with care. And considering the fact that this is not the chipset price for the set of this type Manufacture should pay close attention to this problem.Not waisting my time and money on this earphones anymore. Very disappointed 😔
4,Works great volume could go a little louder though.
5,Nothing more to say about these then BUY THEM. I have gone through countless headsets for my home office. I work full time at home and conference calls are apart of my daily and hourly routine. I have paid for the cheap ones and bought some higher priced ones and none of them lasted or the quality was so bad that people I was talking to were complaining. I have had these for about a year now and wanted to wait to write the review after I could give them an honest rating. They are extremely good quality. The cord doesn't tangle and is made of a high-quality coating. The microphone pics up crisp and clear and doesn't include background noises. Once these finally die I will be buying another set from Jabra.
3,I bought this model for work where I can carry it in the laptop bag whenever I am at other work locations as we use Zoom and also I have a soft phone. What I am unhappy with is that the device fits too tightly on my head. I had to bend the plastic hoop by prying it open almost to the breaking point and it seems to help a bit with comfort. Audio quality seems okay on the first test I did.
5,I really like the headset for calls.  It's much more engaging than my Jabra 930MS that I use most of the time.  I don't listen to music on these as my main cans are a pair of Beyerdynamic DT770 headphones so why would I?  If you're looking for a fantastic headset for Skype/Skype For Business/Slack/Etc and corded is fine then this is your guy.  If you want wireless look at the Jabra Evolve 75 and if you're in an open plan office look at the Sennheiser MB 660.  If you're wanting to listen to music get something designed for that purpose that doesn't make compromises to become a headset.  Don't get me wrong these aren't terrible for that but they aren't good either...but I may be a little bit in camp Beyerdynamic.
5,Good sound good connection no interference
4,The noise cancelling mic is wonderful. I often use it in the car and it cancels out every bit of the road noise. I do use it for singing as well and when I get to a certain volume level it does overwhelm the mic. I'm sure sound guys out there would have a word for it but on the recording you can hear a kind of distortion if I am singing too loud. It helps somewhat if I point the microphone at my chin and even doing that the noise cancellation remains top notch. If they could fix the distortion at the higher volume would absolutely be 5 stars. Otherwise a very good noise cancellation microphone.
3,Something from the get go didn’t seem right. Product in a zip lock bag no box no instructions and appeared used. Product either a return open box special or generic. Should have shopped around paid premium. Very disappointed.
5,I have used these headphones every day for the last 3-months. They are comfortable; I have had no issues with my ears etc. The controls on the cord (mute volume up/down call connect/disconnect) are very convenient. I use Amazon Chime (like zoom or skype) and the controls work fine. Everyone once and awhile maybe once every two weeks the controls become unresponsive. Restarting the computer corrects this problem.
5,A nice headset upgrade over my old Jabra headset that was a few years old.  The earpiece is really comfortable to wear that I forget they are on.  The mic has a little magnetic part so when you raise it up it locks in.
5,He loved it
1,They work really well but they all break at the same spot. I used one for three years without any problems. Now I have had to replace this one three times just this year. I have to move on to another brand/model.
5,The ear pads could be a little bigger. I like the input arm. I have had problems with others that break easily. This one seems quite strong so far. I use it with VR and the accuracy is excellent.
5,These are great I use them everyday in this virtual world.I down rated the noise cancellation as it is passive but it is so good when you are talking your voice seems unreal. I tend not to use the USB component just straight 3.5mm jack to device.
3,Yeah good thing I got these at this price cuz I would've been disappointed had I paid the full price for em. These are ok but Plantronics Blackwire headsets are much better. These Jabra headsets are not comfortable on one of the ears. The sound quality is good but could be better. Save your money and get the Plantronics Blackwire headsets instead of these
3,Decent quality headphones for meetings but these do not fully integrate with MS Teams. Volume up/down works as does the mute button but one can't accept a call or hang-up with the button on the controller. (Even after installing the Jabra Direct software) This might be a Microsoft issue but the bottom line is that these don't completely work with Teams.
4,I guess this item is one of the many things we need to get adapt to the "new normal". They work fine for web based meetings. Could do worse could do better.
4,Callers say they can't hear me even when they volume is turned up
5,Used for WFH computer connection great sound quality. Easy set up. Would recommend.
1,I love Jabre headsets and I know that any product line can have a dud. Easy to return and will not purchase this exact design again. I have done some more research and have made another Jabre purchase.
5,The sound quality using this headset is way better than the Bluetooth speaker device that I was using and lower in cost to.
2,I bought this headset to use for working remotely. They are comfortable to wear. The sound is good. The volume seems low I have to turn them all the way up to 90% to hear most people I am in meetings with. The microphone works well. After using these once a week for a couple years the plastic Arch over the top is cracked. Kind of disappointing for what I paid for them. Also if you're in a online meeting with the video on. You look kind of geeky wearing them. LOL. I would have given these a four-star rating but the arch failing changed it to a two
3,Likes: Clear sound in headphones nice fit clear sound from mic.Dislikes: Cord between volume switch and computer should be another couple feet longer when you move the mic up and down you can hear loud clicking from the movement and the mic did not come with a windscreen
4,The headset is ok.
3,Although the New York Times rated this product tops - I was disappointed.  The sound quality was fair - but it was hard to hear your own voice - and the voices of other people sounded very deep and muffled.  I have a large head and the headphones didn't adjust sufficiently.  Other people told me that the microphone sound quality was great.Overall I preferred the Ear Pods that came with my Apple computer so I returned the Jabra headset -
5,I originally bought a cheaper headset for teams meetings at work and it never seemed to work all the time.  I purchased these and they are great good sound comfortable and always work.
5,Loved everything about it!
3,I purchased this headset because an audio reviewer that I found named them the best quality wired headset for general use with good noise cancellation and sound quality. In my experience the noise cancellation works pretty well but I suffer from regular unpleasant popping sounds. Other headphones I've tried on the same computer seem to work fine so it has to be something with this set. I also didn't realize there was an analog to USB adapter as part of the hardware. This is likely where the noise is coming from and not as good as a straight USB connection though it does make it more flexible to use with other devices.
5,I have tons of headsets from pretty much every Bose consumer product to other high end Plantronics devices such as the Voyager bluetooth/wireless versions.  I love the simplicity and reliability of these.  The call quality consistency and reliability is awesome.  People I work with around the world comment on the high quality audio.  I wear headsets for 6-8 hours per day at work and these never fail.  I have tried so many bluetooth headsets I never get the quality consistency and reliability of a simple USB/wired headset like these.  I love 'em.
1,The whole point of buying these was to have a headphone with a good mic for conference calls. However people on the other end of my calls can hear themselves talking when I use the microphone. Other than that the headphones themselves are not that loud.No idea why these have such high ratings with 5k reviews...
5,I dont write a lot of product reviews but wanted to for this product which ha surpassed expectations. Especially the sound and speaking quality is excellent!
5,My colleagues and customers all say that I sound very crisp and clear. Love it!
5,I use this  headset for work. Which means I’m wearing it from 20 to 40 hours per week and sometimes as many as 8 to 10 hours in a day.  They were great and are well worth the money.
4,These are some of the better headphones for conference phones.  I also have the Blackwire 735 and they are good as well.  I have tried using other headphones but having the boom makes the conversations clearer for those on the other end.  It also helps when recording videos.  My only caveat is that they tend to hurt my ears after being on for a while during the day but all on the ear headphones seem to do that.
1,The mic quality and mic placement of this headset is very disappointing I just barely missed the refund period but I'm very dissatisfied with how this headset fits functions and how the mic sounds no matter the adjustment.
4,Overall this is a solid product with the exception of the noise in the earpiece stemming from the wire connecting the headset to the device.  If the wire hits ANYTHING or rubs against ANYTHING you hear it in the headset. If you are stationary having a conversation then all is good but if you are moving around it can be very annoying.  I have had other Jabra headsets in the past and have not experienced this annoyance.
5,Noise canceling is great. Looked for a long time for a solution for home office (yes kids running around TV on someone knocking at the door etc).I had to be able to take calls without muting and unmuting the phone all the time. I decided to try the Jabra Evolve. It is great. I tested the headphone taking a call using my computer or phone and asked my kids to play and make noise close to me. The other callers could not tell I was in a noisy environment. I tested at the airport taking calls and the meeting participants can't tell where I am (they believe I'm at the office).
3,For some reason touching the wire from the headphones to the puck is noisy almost like the wire entry point is behind a membrane. This isn't an electrical connection problem it's something physical.Microsoft Teams has screwed up something as simple as the bell hook button - check your favorite search engine this is a Teams problem it broke headphones which used to work.Busy light volume control and mute work perfectly well as expected.
5,I bought this product when we were sent to work from home its been great.  It allows me to connect to my phone and roam around the house without being tied to pc.  Sound is great volume control in junction box is awesome.  I would buy again for my team members.
5,Haven't used for 8 hrs straight yet but it it solidly built but not heavy  can you mic on left or right side headband feels good and the "disc" that has the volume/mute/ and hang up functions is easy to see and use
3,Good sound quality comfortable. Highly recommend spend the extra for cordless set. Cord is confining based on where your USB port is located.
2,Bummed over the quality headset fell apart after after 6 months of use.  My co-workers said my voice sounded as if it was masked and I was going to ask for ransom or that I sounded like a monster.  Had one customer hang up on me because the mic muffled my voice so bad they thought they were getting pranked calls.  For the price I expected much better quality.
5,Bought these for a remote call center team during COVID and they are great. Clear sounds easy to set up. I've always liked Jabra headsets and I think these are a good value for the money. As our team grows we'll definitely be buying more of these
5,Bought these for my husband since he works from home and always on calls. He loves them!  Great quality.
5,Same as everyone-working from home due to COVID and a million and one meetings to go to.  Excellent sound quality and comfort for the price.  I’m not looking to invest in insanely expensive headphones right now (or maybe never) unless I need to.  Excellent product! I’m glad I purchased it.
4,Good headphones that work just fine.  I like the boom mic that gets the element right where it needs to be and stays there (yet folds out of the way easily).  The headphones are not quite audiophile quality sounding a bit muffled when listening to music (while still usable for that) but are great for phone calls and conferencing.  I love that I can use the same headset plugged directly into my phone or plug into a computer using the included USB adapter with controls.
5,Arrived quickly and replaced my current model that was stopped working.  Not great on blocking outside noise. Light weight. I wear it for 12 hr shifts at home.
5,This headset worked great for me. I use it for zoom calls connected with the USB to the computer or for conference calls connected directly to the phone. People have said that I sound much better now than when I used the computer microphone or the cellphone straight.
5,I just received the headphones today.  All I had to do was plug them in no installation effort at all.  The sound is good.  I was able to bring up zoom and record.
5,Definitely a good purchase. The headset fits well Windows 10 immediately identifies the device when connecting via the USB and loads the driver. Headset comes with quick visual instruction book to show you how to operate the controls. It also comes with a zippered fabric storage pouch. The audio reception is excellent and the audio to the audience is excellent. Definitely straighten the red audio lead before you don the headset; it is heavy and well-constructed but will curl if you don't straighten it beforehand (and a curled cable can be distracting).
5,I use this headset for Skype calls listening to music and movie streaming. Comfortable to wear and very good sound quality. The connection cord does not crimp as my previous Logitech headset cord did.  Detachable cord allows to also use the headset with my Samsung S7 cellphone. UPDATE: After using for several months it remains comfortable to wear for hours. The spongy part around the ear is especially good. As mentioned before the connection cord is round-ish preventing crimping and is plenty long to maneuver around my desk. Recommended highly.
5,Nice
5,Had had other head phones for work that didn't last over a few months.  So far the sound quality and comfort and better than the past ones.
5,I got these to WFH and it cancels out most of the noise. Only downside is if you have trouble Hearing  don't get one sided someone times it's hard to hear.
3,The audio sounds decent on both ends; however the comfort level is not so great.  You need a small head to use these and the way they sit on your ears is weird at best.  I'll keep them but I wish I would have kept looking.
5,Great - clear sounding I can hear the customers pet fish fart in the other room with these-
4,I use this product daily for work out of my house....very happy with them.
5,The sound quality is great for the microphone and the headset.  You can wear it for hours but it helps to take it off ever hour or so to give your ears a break.  I wish the cord was a foot longer.
3,The arm for the mic is loose and with not remain in place. This is after a month of use. Dissatisfied with the quality of assembly.
2,I bought this specifically for two features and it failed on both:1. Compatibility with MS Teams - It's not Teams compatible. for example the simplest functionality of being able to mute myself through the headset's mute button does NOT work on Team calls.2. Noise cancelling microphone. There's a review saying that while wearing the headset others on the call can't hear the children in the background. That is not true. my team members hear what's happening in the room and it's distracting.I have tried this for over 30 days. Unfortunately I cannot return it so hoping you won't make the same mistake I made. If you are looking for a headset with the above features this is NOT the one.
3,I got these because reviews say the noise cancelation was great and nope ppl on the other end can hear.  No better than the less expensive pair I bought before
5,I work in customer service and the noise cancellation feature is the reason I bought them and also they were recommended by a friend.
5,This has a usb connector that plugs into my laptop - I use it with WebEx Skype and Team Meetings.  Clear sound made well comfortable plug and play.  Great headphones - which is so necessary while working from home during this pandemic.
3,Got the impression that these are over-the-ear headphones when in fact for me they are on-the-ear. As an individual who wears hearing aids and glasses they proved to be uncomfortable.  Gave them to my daughter who found them to be a perfect fit. She is using them to produce her podcast. Working great for her needs.
5,This headset was purchased to operate on a VoIP phone and a computer too (with a cool USB switch between them). This is a very nice headset but its power draw is too much for the particular VoIP phone here. I almost sent it back because it didn't work with the phone (flawless on the computer!) but it's too nice to toss back. I'm currently using an older Jabra headset (almost as nice) until this phone eventually goes away...
1,If you are looking for a quality headset look somewhere else.  I am extremely disappointed with the quality of this headset.Audio:While using the USB I had to have the volume turned up to 100% in order to hear my call.  Adjusting the gain in my sound driver booted it somewhat but there was a predictable drop in sound quality.  I could plug it directly using the headphone jack and the volume issues got better (the sound quality was still bad) but then I couldn't use the controls which were the main reason why I wanted this particular head set.Recording:The mic quality is absolute rubbish.  I attempted to record myself several times using the USB and directly into the headphone jack and it sounded terrible.  When I used it in teams others on my call could barely understand me.  Playing around with the mic setting on my PC seemed to make little difference.Overall:I am returning this headset. I honestly can not believe that they think product is worth what they are asking for it. It is a ripoff at half the price.
5,Nothing NOT to like about this - it works in all conditons and remotely is one of the best Jabra has out there.  My staff at UMN love this headset.
2,I purchased these exactly a year ago today. I purchased these because my company provided me with a pair and the headphone fell off...I figured it was because maybe they sent a "cheaper" version...so I splurged. Well don't you know....after exactly ONE YEAR my headphone fell off...like clockwork!I expected more out of these. I do love them they are great for noise cancelling. I don't need to yell into the mic to be heard and provide me enough volume without bursting my eardrums...but I can't see spending this much money every year.
4,It works great. I love being able to plug in to either an audio port or a usb port. However I wish the microphone was bendable. Even with that issue I am happy to recommend this product.
4,Likes:Good packaging.Smaller compact and lighter.The foam pads are actually very small but comfortable. It's coming with the control puck so you can light up the left ear cup to show you are busy on a call.Good job of cleanup up noise and background sounds.Ideal for use in the office.Good microphone.Dislikes:Not for audiophiles.
5,Great purchase
5,Love these for working from home. So easy to mute and unmute as well as control volume and end meeting.
5,Great sound and feel very comfortable while wearing them.
5,the headset itself is a bit heavy on my head but otherwise it all works grate
5,It really does cancel out noise. Both my husband & I work from home I don’t hear him talking with these on !
3,The pressure on my ear after using most of the day is too much. Took a while for me to realize I need a different kind of Headphone. Going to have to buy another set that’s over the ear because extended wear just ends up being too painful
5,I ordered this to run my home based business from a cellphone and I have to say that I am blown away at the quality and clarity that this headset offers. I speak in my normal voice and the other person I'm talking to has no problem hearing me.  I have tried Bluetooth headsets only to put them in a drawer to collect dust.  I assure you this headset will never be in a drawer.  It is top shelf for sure.
3,It works ok connected easily to my laptop and is more noise canceling (or at least reducing) than I was expecting after seeing what the earpads looked like. Unfortunately the speakers are extremely quiet; I have to keep my computer's volume around 90% just to be able to hear someone speaking at a normal level. I'm not sure if this is normal or if mine is just slightly defective but it's incredibly inconvenient. Also I find the headband to be uncomfortable to wear after a while; I wish there was cushioning where the headset rests on the top of your head.
4,It is very clear sound
3,Compared to a $20 Logitech or other headset it's far superior. But for the same price the Plantronics Blackwire 5200 is MUCH better. I highly recommend the 5200. (currently only avail on the Plantronics website) More comfortable better sound and people on the other end of the line say they can hear me better. Details such as the size of the wire (the Jabra is large and stiff and when you move it rubs creating noise in the headset vs the Plantronics which is small and flexible and you don't even notice it). The Plantronics 5200 feels like it's part of my head. The Jabra feels like it's sitting on top and it slowly slips off especially if I move around at all.
1,Video on youtube of guy running blender in background is obviously a paid endorsement. They pick up background noise as much as any other headset microphone. Did not work with the Avaya phone system I use at work.
5,So far I love these.  I find them comfortable (I do have a small head)..the sound is great and I'm told my voice to others is very good.  I LOVE the fact I can use them with USB and my PCs or with 3mm jack on smartphone.  Hand control within the wiring is also very nice.  I've loved everything I've had fro Jabra!  Can't even count how many headphones I've gone through due to nature of my work.
5,Jabra continues to be the best.  I've purchase five now for these for the business.  Well worth it.
5,I had gotten one and it broke and the. I got my replacement and so far so good. Next it will be wireless.
5,I spend hours per day on international conference calls and I sometimes need to type at the same time which means I must use a headset.  I tried a number of different options before landing on this Jabra set - and it has been just about perfect!  I love that you can rotate the boom microphone to either side so it can be worn on either ear.
4,I use this every day.  I put it in its carrying case and throw it in my backpack with other heavy things and it survives very very well. I have noticed the material of the ear pads slightly degrading perhaps this is just the nature of the material.  However it would be nice to have easily replaceable ear covers.
2,29 Jan. 2021I bought this Jabra headset in May 2020 after reading a review on NYT's Wirecutter.  It is falling apart already.The mechanism to adjust them over one's head gets stuck and gets caught on and pulls out my hair.  The headset has lost its ability to be snug against my head -- leading to it falling down or off during Zoom meetings.  The sound quality is good but they are almost unusable now.They cost almost $100 and I think should have lasted longer.  I will not buy them again.
3,Even though it’s advertised as USB it still uses 3mm connections to volume control
1,This was second order first order the ear muff fell off and 2 wires were disconnected and today not even 3 months again I should have purchased a cheaper headset
3,Poor tinny sound quality
3,For a basic headset it probably does it's job. But the description of this product is misleading as flipping hell which is why I am returning it!!  It says "Get easy access to the most used functions like volume and mute. You can also answer and end calls directly from the control unit."  what they did NOT say is that said functions are USB only and obviously will not work with your phone! You can NOT pick up and end calls on your phone because there are no controls on the headset or the 3.5 mm cable. If this is the function you are looking for with a decent headset look elsewhere cause this isn't it!
5,I'm very impressed with this headset. I can still hear some ambient noise but it is quiet in the background and the volume of the headset is more than sufficient to overcome what noise filters in. I'm not at all distracted by the background noise. Also callers consistently report not being able to tell I'm in a room that has significant street noise. This headset is comfortable to wear and the cord has substantial heft to it so I'm guessing it won't be damaged any time soon. I haven't used it with my computer yet but it has been an ideal solution for work calls from my cellphone.
5,I love this headset. Works great with Teams Google Skype.  I work from home and this has been perfect for handling meetings while screen sharing.
1,Stopped working after a month. Customers complain I go in and out all the time. Very uncomfortable after wearing long periods
2,Sounded great and the mic was decent but both sets started cracking after a few months of use in the same spot. Not a reliable product.
4,I purchased this headset for use with my iPhone for work from home.  I've found it to be very comfortable during extended use and voice clarity to be excellent.  Since I plug the headphone directly into my phone I am not able to use the included control device (volume/call disconnect) as it only has a USB plug.  This was not clear in the product description and is certainly inconvenient  but not a deal breaker.
5,Good sound quality easy to wear for long periods no feedback!
5,I use this Stereo Headset for Microsoft Teams at work and it's great - audio quality is decent and the controls are very easy to use. I really like the "don't disturb me" light which can be turned on and off from the controller. I find these are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time - much better than my old Plantronics USB headset.
5,I've been using this pair for a year. They are so very comfortable. The only issues I've had is the microphone sometimes swivels down when I don't want it to move. The volume controls have been having trouble responding also. I'm happy they're comfortable that's why I bought them.
3,$100.00 for basic headphones that are beat by $10.00 best buy ones. guess you have to spend money to make money
5,Great headset! MS Team's Zoom Google and connect it to my mobile phone.
5,I use this daily with Bria 5 software.  Works flawless.  Comfortable fit.  USB connection
5,Great sound and noise cancellation. I had some construction going on outside and no one could hear it on the call. I like how the 1/8” AUX cable works with my phone.
1,I cannot rate the  quality of the product but the description says the product is new.  There is no indication that it is frustration free packaging.The Jabra Evolve 40 was packaged in a zip lock bag.  No box.  Instructions are look to be usedOther than some cables I usually never see items package in a zip lock bag as its primary packaging.This occurred twice.  The original order and the replacement.  Return for refund will try another model.
4,The sound is unsurpassable and the noise reduction as well. My only complaint is they don't stay on my head. I battle with them every time I want to move. I teach online and I have to reach for things. They fall off easily.
1,If it were reliable this product would be great however an 80% failure rate in the first two years is terrible.  There is obviously a fatal design or manufacturing flaw in these.  Since I bought the five of these over a period of about 6 months it isn't just one bad batch.  Otherwise the headphone is quite nice and it's great having a separate USB adapter you can unplug the headphone from so you can plug the headphone into your phone.  The sound quality and comfort are very good and it picks up fairly little background noise.  But there's no point in buying them if they just fail over and over  And the failures were in different PCs so it's not one PC with a rogue USB port that zaps them.  UPDATED 2021-03-15: The 5th of 5 USB adapters just died so it is now a 100% failure rate.  Ridiculously bad.  But I found a $12.99 USB adapter from KOOPAO on Amazon so hopefully I can still use the headphones.
5,Ear cushions money's worth
3,Good headset until it broke (lasted about 3-1/2 months). Right cup snapped off and then wire disconnected. Used while WFH left in my office. I own several headphones by Bose and have never broken any. These aren’t as expensive but they do cost $100+
5,The sound quality is exceptional. I bought these to use with ZOOM  conference calls and they work great.
1,I liked these headphones while they worked. I even bought a second pair for my wife. First one of the ear pieces had a piece of plastic that made the headphone detach but it was covered by warranty. However it took 2 months to get a replacement after shipping the headphones back to them.Now I have a pair that have the leatherette coming undone and exposing the foam under it. This has happened with other Jabra products but other ones have been easy to find a replacement earpiece on the open market. Not so with Jabra. They will only sell 10 of these (5 pair) at a time for nearly the cost of the headphones. Now I just have trash and no headphones.
4,The microphone was designed to "filter" out external sounds other than the speaker's voice.  This may seem like a good feature but it also requires the microphone to be placed perfectly in front of your mouth.  Nobody wants to hear breathing.  The boom is adjustable but does not firmly stay in place and can be easily knock out of "perfect placement".
5,They work as expected onmh phone and my laptop.
4,It works as good as advertised and it’s very useful. It has the matte finish which makes it look nicer and the microphone has a magnet so you can put it on the band while you’re not using it.
3,So so performance
3,This head phone works well with Zoom.  When using WebEx outgoing voice works but not the ear piece.  Contacted the customer service several time.  Very unhelpful.
2,I bought this headset on the strength of reviews on Wirecutter and amazon. the headset is touted as being extremely comfortable great fo rall-day use. Well it isn't. The one earcup fits tightly on my ear causing a lot of pressure. The circular controller module is heavy and causes the cord to "droop" making it difficult to position. And for some reason every time I touch the cord I can hear it through the headset. The sound quality of the headset is good as is the microphone positioning and quality. If I hadn't thrown away some of the packaging I'd return it and get my money back. Don't buy this headset.
5,These things rock for music and zoom calls lightweight comfortable and good quality sound. I would buy again.
1,may be because this was a reverbush (sp) item
5,My employees loved this thing. Great quality and it canceled a lot of background noise.
5,I needed a good headset for teaching on line and this is the best!! Whether I am listening to music or teaching a class in a webinar... it's works perfect! Great price great seller too!
5,Great sound comfortable ease of use simple to begin using right away. They came highly recommended and I can see why.
4,These sound great and everyone can hear me fine. They get a little uncomfortable after an hour or so. Next time I would consider wireless.
4,no doubt a bit pricey for a corded pc telephone / jabber headset.  but tis top quality.  had a logitech - it fell apart after 3 weeks.  am sure the bluetooh jabra is excellet but $190.00.  in the end - no regrets - excellent for pc phone use
5,Good sound but the ear pad is too bulky
5,Working excellent with out any distortion
2,Update 10/17/16It's been 8 months since I purchased these headset. Worked great for about 6 month. Around then I noticed a small crack where the right side can slides back into the band.  After a couple of days the can would slide all the way out.  In the past few days the other side started to crack.  I have 2 dangling cans that I have to constantly fiddle with the stay on my head.  Too much plastic in the build.These headsets are awesome.  I'm a musician and have some issues with hearing on one side so my original mono headsets were not cutting it.  I got these for google voice and I can hear my customer clearly and they can hear me clearly as well.  Great product.  I also like the mute and volume feature on the USB dongle.  Seems to be pretty good build without losing flexibility.  I also have a big head but the headset fits well for my melon.
2,I purchased this headset to use in my home office for work and play. I wanted a headset that was comfortable enough to wear all day had good audio quality for both the input and output was lightweight and had some style.This headset met all of those requirements but one the most important one audio quality. Output quality is just fine until you open a communications related application. Anything that seems to grab the windows microphone device causes the Jabra headset to go into a *significantly* lower bitrate mode. You lose all bass effects midrange is squashed and treble is amplified. It's literally like going from a theater to a small bathroom as far as acoustics are concerned.I contacted Jabra support and was told this is a function of the headset a "feature" and that it cannot be disabled. It makes the headset useless for anything but communications.If you don't care at all about audio quality might be a good headset for you. I'm returning mine.
5,Very comfortable and easy to use product integrated well into me teams
1,Did not cancel out any noise on either end. Product came as pictured nothing broken but it didn't do what it says it's supposed to do.
2,This headset is advertised with HD stereo sound and the ability to rotate the microphone for use on either the right or the left side. However when the microphone is rotated for use on the left side and the headset is accordingly rotated on the head the speakers do not switch from left to right and vice versa to maintain correct stereo sound. For correct left/right stereo sound the microphone must be positioned on the right side only not the left.
5,Great improvement over my old Jabra headset.  I can hear so much better now with stereo and others commented how much clearer I sound on calls.  Plug and play for Skype at least for me.
5,Works really well.
5,As advertised this headset/microphone set works great.  Excellent sound quality and mic volume works well in Windows 10.
5,I have been searching for a head set with good mic. This one found to be perfect fit for me.
5,This headset rocks! Definitely upped my teams experience. Comfortable and easy to use.
4,High quality professional headset. Very good sound quality over mic... a few people in my office have tried them and they perform perfectly on calls. They aren’t super comfortable after multiple hours however and don’t really block out other office sounds.
5,Comfortable good mic light weight easy setup. If using a docking station make sure to connect it directly to laptop; otherwise there may be interference noise.
5,I’m so impressed with the quality! Get it!
1,Straight up junk.
5,Very clear to hear the person on the other end. I love the access to the mute button and the option to use as simply headphones to listen to music on other devices by detaching the USB port. The headset also comes with travel bag and it's height can be adjusted reasonably. It was worth every penny! So far so good...I've been using this headset for a few weeks.
2,I have a Lenovo X1 Carbon 6th gen and this headset sounds great when I plug it in to the laptop directly. When I connect it to a USB 3.1 dock station either with a USB-A or USB-C plug there are intermittent pops and clicks in the audio signal. Most of the time the quality is poor enough to be a distraction. Jabra's answer to this was "well it happens with dock stations sometimes" but there should be a compatibility list even if incomplete. Additionally something as simple as 2 channel audio I/O should be able to be carried through a dock station. This isn't gigabytes per second we're talking about.Also when I removed the Evolve LINK dongle and connected directly to the dock station's audio port it worked fine.Amazon has granted a refund and I'll be getting something whose features I can take advantage of fully.
5,So it is so important for me a salesman in a loud office to have headphones with a mic that only picks up my voice and nothing else. I don’t want my potential prospects thinking I’m in a loud grimey call center. It was hard to find a pair of headphones that does it as well as These headphones do. Highly recommend
5,This is a comfortable headset for anyone that has to use one for extended periods of time. The cord is a good length but I don't care for the in-cord volume/mute control. It tends to pull the cord off the desk.
3,It was great at the beginning but stopped working after 2 days
4,Great build quality  not so great sound for music. I also have the Plaintronics C520. The bass on the Jabra was a bit 'tinny'  with avereage quality. For teleconferencing it works great.
5,The best at a great  value
3,The sound is inconsistent. Read the description thoroughly. I thought I was getting a two ear headset. What came was a one ear set. I was in a bind and needed it for work so didn't return it.
5,Excellent sound quality and comfy cushiony headphones.
5,Not great for music but great for business and comfortable
5,These are perfect using them for extended periods. I work from home via the internet and use them for 6+ hours a day. Very comfortable even at the end of the day and the sound quality is great. Good quality feel in your hand too.These are not bluetooth but Jabra makes them. I needed usb connected ones for work.
1,I loved this headset and used it for about a month.  All of a sudden I can no longer hear the other person unless I turn it up to 100% and even then barely hear them.  Very frustrating hoping that is covered under warranty as my return window closed 24 days ago.
1,the mic boom is adjustable except moving it causes huge amounts of audible noise.  a friend referred to it as "cartoon farting".  so if you want to move the mic away from your mouth to take a drink then you have to remember to mute first before moving the mic.  this is pretty intolerable.in theory the device is supposed to switch left/right according to the position of the mic:  i could not get this to work it insisted on having left/right in one fixed orientation (not the one i want).  even if i could get it to work what would its default be with the mic boom in the upright position?  i don't always have the mic at my mouth i prefer to move it out of the way.
5,Needed something with excellent clarity for Zoom court appearances.  Works great.
1,I have used USB headsets for years day-in day-out for many years at work and home.  I have never had a failure.  I bought this unit and plugged it into my PC in place of my old USB headset.  After about two weeks it died.  Amazon was really great in shipping a replacement headset the next day.  The new headset lasted almost three weeks.  The unit is two components a headset with mic that uses the standard 4 conductor mini-plug and a base that the mini-plug goes into and has a cable that plugs in to the USB port.  The base has buttons to physically mute and increase/decrease volume and has LEDs to indicate status.  Two different bases have failed on their own plugged into the same USB port on my PC where my old headset is now plugged into (again).I like the sound and comfort of the new headset.  So using a mic/headset splitter cable I will attempt to continue to use the headset plugged directly into the headphone and microphone jacks on my PC.  Thus the one star.Really disappointing from a company named Jabra.
3,The product worked for about a week then volume kept cutting out.  I’m returning.
5,I had no idea my computer's internal microphone was so bad until I bought this.  Have received three compliments on my teleconference audio in the past week alone.
5,Works great and sound quality is excellent
5,So far I tested the sound cancellation as I work from home and I love having my fan full blast I needed something to block out the noise and it seems to work I made a call and they couldn't hear the fan or basic background noise.. I'm excited to work with them.
3,Ears hurt after using for about an hour. Sent back.
4,Great set of headphones.  Look and sound great.  One item for me personally is the ear pad could be a little larger.Headphones work perfectly with my iphone.
5,Good controls. Good noise cancellation
5,Great headset. I am on conference calls most of the day they dont hurt your ears and dound quality is wonderful.  Love that i can also plug into my phone and use for calls there.Great forvmusic on my pc while working
4,Quality and usability of product are great. Nice feel and lightweight too. Works well overall
5,In the world of conference calls this item has become an essential part of my office equipment. Performs exactly to the description. Lightweight good audio and mic.
1,I've been a long time and stead fast Jabra headset user and proponent.  That ended with my first and last eperience with their suporrt team.  One of my first headset purchases I have purchased numersous wired and wireless sets has no failed - will no longer charge - I fully expect that I will begin to see more of my Jabra products fail for the same or similar reason; based upon their feedback and attitude when 'helping' me with these buds.  It seems that once you reach warranty period no matter how well you take care of your electronics nor the reason for failure (quality design other) who knows as Jabra just says sorry we have no further details but look forward to your future business.... hmmm well I for one will be looking for another headset company
5,I use this in my home office for work calls on my mobile phone to free up my hands.  I have asked numerous people how it sounds and so far there are no complaints.  The headset feels sturdy and I have packed it in my laptop bag on a few flights with no issues.  I have had this for several weeks and it is MUCH better sounding than any of the Bluetooth devices I used previously.  I would buy this again knowing what I know now.
5,Great headset.  Was mainly looking for a headset that preserved my voice in good quality while blocking out all other ambient noise.  This one performs superbly on. Overall quality of sound is great and very comfortable for wearing all day.  If you work from home or in an otherwise noisy environment you won’t be disappointed!
5,Great value for meetings
5,Great work headphones for the nonstop virtual meetings
5,I've tried several less expensive options.  Don't waste your time or money.  This headset is great.  I get compliments on the sound quality.  I use WebEx (Skype on rare occasion).  Works great with any app where you use your computer/laptop speakers.
1,I have literally got better sound quality from the dollar store headphones. And unfortunately I'm stuck with them because the customer service sucks worse than the actual product and that's saying a lot. Save your money go to family dollar and buy a pair at least when you get home with and you can't hear sound from them you can simply take them back for a refund. Unlike Jabra who must know how bad their product is because they simply don't offer the option of a refund. (I don't blame you guys I wouldn't want them back either once they left)
5,Works great for work calls
3,Good product  but first pair broke before I got to use itSecond pair just melted in the sun in my room and left a sticky mess
5,This little bugger is expensive but OMG... I got what I paid for. This headset not only works great it's versatile. I can USB it to my laptop for video calls and listening online or I can separate the cord and plug it into my phone for hands-free calling. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
5,Great mobile set to have at the office or in your briefcase.  Easy setup for meetings with nice controls for volume and muting.  Very clear reception for meetings.
5,Sound is clear and very comfortable
3,The sound audio and mic quality is simply amazing. In the office I have literally no complaints.But as a whole it is entirely too breakable. After the first one I bought broke around the left ear I bought another and was extra careful but this time the wire broke around the plug.I would buy these for the rest of my life if they didn't break every 6-10 months.
2,This item was marketed as having a noise canceling/reducing microphone.  It has proven to not filter out extra noise at all.  It is picking up the TV that is located on the next floor down.  I might as well use the microphone on my laptop I don't understand why this is a $100 item.
3,Product is in a good condition and everything works well.. But the Noise cancelation ist not that what i expected.. when people talking around me or when people dropping the glasses in the sink the mic record it.... when you work in a co working Space like me ( digital nomad ) i can't recommended but when you use it at home in a separated room the headset works perfect.
4,Well made. indifferent sound works well with Windows10/Skype earpieces are warm; noise cancellation is nothing to write home about.
1,I got these headphones hoping for something pretty great. They are MEH. I recently got the $20 Logitech H390 and got these looking for a next level. These are the equivalent and I will be returning them. If you don’t need noise blocking they’re ok my clients can’t hear the people around me- but it’s the exact same result as the $20 Logitech ones. There’s no difference. Save $50 and stick with those. I’m returning them.
5,Right out of the box these headphones offer extremely crisp performance. I enjoy my music but also needed something to use with my Dragon Speak so this is a very good choice to accomplish that. The mic portion functioned flawlessly with 0 missed words during dictation. My rating is actually 4.5 stars because I would make them more over the ears given a choice for better comfort.
5,Very comfortable for daily and long term use.  I use this headset daily for Skype meetings that can go on for a long time.  I had a more expensive unit for years and it finally wore out.  I don't expect any less from this headset.
4,Great for intended purpose of conference calls but not at all good for music. I would give it five stars for conference calls and two stars as a stereo headset for music.
5,Nothing to dislike
5,Have been using Plantronics V5200 Bluetooth headset for 7 months connecting laptop which is good for speaking but introduces quite bad sound quality.  This one introduces me quite awesome noise cancellation & sound quality at the same time.  I am quite satisfied.
4,Plastic square that attaches to the ear speaker broke and is not covered by warranties. Had to apoxie but works amazing for professional environment and noise cancelling
5,Perfect for Zoom
5,Work
4,Worked ok. Expensive for use.
5,Fantastic headset.  Versatile with great sound and microphone.  I use these for Skype calls GoToMeeting and Rosetta Stone. They have not failed me yet! Installed instantly on Windows 7 and 10. Lightweight and comfortable.
5,Works very well
5,I work from home.
2,I use this headset as a replacement for my company-issued Jabra earpiece. Had it two months and the audio quality has declined significantly and I'm receiving nonstop static over the headset with regular usage. Customers can hear the static and is not conducive to effective calls.
5,Since getting this headset I've had people asking me what headset I'm using because it sounds so amazing on the other end.I use it on my Mac and have no problems with it at all as far as compatibility goes. I've used it with FaceTime Skype Google Hangouts Google Meet and Slack and it works perfect with all of them.
1,I bought these headphones as the Vonage platform requires either plantronics or Jabra headsets for integrated desktop calling...Seriously disappointed. The sounds quality is terrible. I have difficulty hearing the person I'm speaking with and the volume controls are out of sync with the volume settings on my computer so going from listening to music at standard volume to receiving a call is an excellent way to blow out your eardrums. The integration with the software on the computer in anything but intuitive and it took thirty minutes plus just to get it working while other headsets work properly as soon as they are plugged in.The headphones themselves hut my ears after about thirty minutes as well so they are completely impractical for a business application where I am talking with clients all day long. Additionally you can hear eveything going on around you in the office so the level of distraction is high. Again Highly disappointed with the Jabra headset and the vonage platform for forcing me to put these pieces of garbage on my head.Fail.
5,Microphone is loud and clear.
5,This is a nice unit. The bi-aural sound is great. Feels durable and is easy to use. Has a nice "weight to it". The boom is flexible and you can spin around so you can have the boom coming from the left or right side. Crystal clear mike.
2,I purchased this specifically because I wanted good noise canceling which this set specifically claims to have. I was skeptical that headphones that sit on the ears could work well but I bought them anyway. Unfortunately there is no ambient noise canceling from the headphones. Every over-the-ear headphones I've ever used do a better job of blocking ambient noise than this set. Maybe they only meant that the microphone is helped by the tech but the description should make that more clear.Quality of the sound is decent as long as you stick to voice and I've been told that the microphone sounds good. The included base is a little confusing but it's nice to have volume and mute buttons within reach.
3,The product looks great feels great and works great but not with my Macbook Air. None has been able to help me out. My clients complaint that my audio is cutting off but on my end the audio is great. So frustrating after spending so much money I cant use it with my laptop. I contacted them downloaded their different updating program etc .... but no results.
2,I purchased this headset on August 13 2020 & they failed on August 3 2021. Very comfortable headset with a pretty good sound. No issues with comfort just the dang design is such that it makes the swivel on the earpads VERY delicate.
5,Bought to use for meetings and have been very happy with it.
3,Be warned - this headset does not play nice with FaceTime. I ordered it to use for video conferencing on my MacBook Pro and had difficulty getting the output to come through the headset when using the USB connector. This isn't a problem with the headset so much as it is a problem with how FaceTime handles the input from the USB. You can use it with the headphone jack only but then you lose the ability to use the USB controller for volume and mute.
4,They are great!
2,We have purchased this twice in the last year but it seems to only have a life of about 4-5 months  Both times the set has broken on us at the same spot at the switch that resides on the line for muting and other options on the headset.  This was a big plus for getting this set and the first time we chalked it up to just bad luck or such and since my husband loved it for work we ordered it again only to have the same piece break again.  We will look for another one and probably not a Jabra.  Too expensive to have to be replacing it twice a year.
1,When I used this unit on both my PC and my Mac both microphone and speaker volumes were extremely low.  None of the controls would improve the situation.Also once I was able to run a test through Webex and Zoom on both PC and Mac the quality was extremely "boxy" and sounded no better than a $30 headset I bought from Amazon at the beginning of the pandemic.The unit I received was supposedly new but it came in a plastic ziploc bag not in a box.  I suspect this was a return that made it back into the "new" inventory stream.I bought this unit after seeing it was the top-rated headset on Wirecutter.Very disappointed in Jabra.
1,I had a Jabra headset below that I loved.  Unfortunately my little guy broke it and I bought this as a replacement.  Definitely easy to plug-and-play but the wiring is bad and the output changes throughout the call.  At times sounds like they are in a tunnel and other times it's very clear.  Wouldn't purchase again as that sound change drives me crazy.
4,I have a very loud co-worker and it does a great job of eliminating the background noise in my office for the recipient of my call. I wish the noise cancelation would also reduce what I'm hearing in my office.
2,This item is great for people like me that work at home and care about what people on the other side hears. No one can tell that I work from home when I'm using this. I can join online meetings using the USB connection and I can join phone conferences using my cell phone. I have a baby daughter that makes a lot of noise but as long as I have the door closed no one can tell.-updateThe mic picks up your breathing which is annoying. Good mic but there are better choices out there. My daily driver is the plantronics voyager legend. Noise cancelling on the mic is better on the voyager.
5,The Jabra exceeded my expectations in all respects; comfort volume and sound quality.  My old headset from the 1970's would not work with the new wireless phones but the Jabra was super in all respects.
5,Is a great product.  Relied upon the review by Wirecutter.
5,Great product - wired and secure.
5,am using it for cisco jabber. excellent.  much better than the basic logitech headset. use it for mic for pc gaming as well.
4,Excellent less expensive wired headset. I'd like it more if it could extend a bit farther (it barely reaches both ears at full extension) but this headset is comfortable provides good noise isolation and works well.
5,great product
5,Worth the money.  Great quality!  Love this headset
5,I work from home and needed a great pair of headphones and I'm so glad I purchased these. I have previously brought other headphones and ultimately ended up returning them. I no longer struggle with being heard while talking to clients it's great.
5,got this originally from my job.  when the old one finally broke I ordered a replacement immediately.  it lasted about 4 years pretty good for something I use multiple times per day and pack in  my backpack to travel with most weeks.
5,This is a great product at a great price.  I don't use a headset a lot  but I need a reliable one with with great sound.  This one fits what I need.
2,The only thing these share in common with other $100 headphones is the cord quality. The actual headset is all plastic and very cheap quality. Like those early headsets that came with a Sony walkman type quality. Flimsy garbage returning.
1,I bought this for a job that lasted around a month. After that I used it to play games on my switch. I went to play a game one day and the microphone stopped working. I noticed that the microphone piece was removable (why?) so I thought that it had just fallen a bit and so I used something small to move it up a bit and it just pops out. For 90 bucks I expected maybe a year of use not maybe 4 months.
5,Great headphones for leading conference calls and for chilling out afterwards.  I can hear my colleagues much more clearly than on the bluetooth headset I had used before.  They work well with Skype on my laptop.
2,The Jabra Evolve was highly rated on many sites and recommended on serveral "Best of" lists.  Not sure if mine is defective but it feels very tight and uncomfortabe.  Very little adjustment capabilities.
5,By far the best I have used. Great sound quality and easy set up.
5,So far so good. I am a remote employee and have used plantronics for years. Was looking for more noise cancelation capabilities. These do not disappoint. Very comfortable and sound quality is excellent.
2,I can only wear the headphones for a short time before it begins digging into the top of my head giving me a headache. Also the connection works intermittently with my MacBook Air (no such problem with a Chromebook so the problem is probably with my Mac).
3,Good sound and I like the inline controls.  With a USB-C adapter it works with my OnePlus 7T.  Downside: seriously uncomfortable.
2,Call quality and noise cancelling was good for a home office.  Lasted 2 years before the USB link ENC010 suddenly died while on a call.  Same results on two different Win10 machines so it's pretty much confirmed.
5,This is a great pair of compute headphones for business calls or listening to music.
2,I bought these because all the reviews said they were high quality and comfortable to wear all day. I spend 12 hours per day with my headset on and could only wear these for 2 hours before my ears hurt. The quality from my mic was not great either. I returned them. I previously had the Plantronics Audio .678  and loved them could wear them 20 hours per day if I needed to but sadly they no longer make them. Tried the Plantronics Blackwire 325 and although I can wear them for longer they do hurt my ears.
4,Headphones work great for online calls
1,Pros: Great sound quality good looking pair of headphones easy to use.Cons: Pricey uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour and poor design causes them to fall apart.I bought these headphones in March 2020 and they were good quality at first but within 6 months the headband began to separate and now (August 2021) one of the headphones has completely separated from  the headphones leaving it dangling by a thin wire. Both sides of the headband have also separated. This is the second pair of these that I've had and both have fallen apart in the same way in about a year's time. They were great initially but I want to warn people about what happens within 6 - 12 months of owning these headphones even with gentle use.
5,I use this headset with my laptop for calling customers hands free. It's great quality and everyone seems to hear well on both ends of the line. Love it!
2,Cannot recommend. They were great for 6 months then the headset with the mic broke clean off. These are just another expensive throw away item that fills up landfills with wasted resources.
1,It didn't take more than two days of work use and the mic drops to the lowest position and will cannot hold its' own weight in any position. - Would NOT purchase again this is a very real issue that has (for the most part) gone unmentioned. - Follow up. - The earpiece broke from the frame and just short of superglue no real options to repair. - I do think this will kill the brand for me. - Within a few months the connection became prone to static in the line to the pc USB. - Stay away and put money toward a much better brand.
5,I just received the package today and quickly tested it. Great quality the sound quality you won't hear the noise background at all. Quality of the material is also good. I love all of it. Thank you very much!
2,My biggest issue is comfort. The moment I placed the headphones on my head I knew I had just wasted $100. Sooo uncomfortable! The headband literally presses down on the top of my head. Uuuggghhh!!!!
5,Just what I needed. I had a $300 set of noise cancelling headset that simply didn't work and the Jabra at a fraction of the price delivers on quality for the price. The noise reducing microphone is what I was really after and it's perfect in my very noisy office area!
5,Just what I needed.
2,Generally a good product but after about 5 months of use it occasionally stops working for 15 seconds in the middle of calls.  It is defective and should be covered by warranty.
5,The product arrived quickly and in new condition. I've already used it for a podcast interview and it worked well.
5,I purchased this headset for business calls made from my house where there can be a noisy environment.  Thus far the headphones are working as advertised as my associates can hear very little of the background noise even when there is a lot of noise.
1,Got this based on the glowing reviews from many sources including wirecutter. Unfortunately  the headphone looks like it was cheaply built. There is a lot of static if the wire connection is even touched slightly making this unusable. I paid $100 for this expecting it to last a while. I have contacted Jabra for warranty service through their website and will update the review if and when the problem is resolved. Guess wirecutter cannot be trusted anymore.Not a happy camper !
4,Not travel friendly however a great headphone set the boom could be longer
3,Works well for zoom and other video/audio calls on my laptop. Wish it was more comfortable. After 30 minutes on a call my ears are tired.
5,I've been using this for a few months now.Very very good product. I have owned a few Jabra products and all have been good.This one is definitely one I'd recommend to others.
4,Very comfortable and features are awesome would definetly recommend great buy worth the money for sure
5,Buen headset
5,Great
5,Absolutely great headphones.  I bought them for my wife who does customer service at home.  It cancels out the surrounding noise is light and the sound quality is excellent.
2,In terms of working with Skype it's done very well.  The physical construction however isn't great.  The two silver pieces at the base of the headband broke and the unit won't stay in position.  This is surprising because I've treated the unit very gently.Because it's under warranty the company will try to fix/replace it but I've got to return the original unit (at my expense unfortunately).Since I use this for work I guess I will be without a headset for several weeks?!  Mmmh... a pain.
4,Very clear would recommend highly.  A bit bulky which is why I did not give it a 5 star.
2,Overpriced for their quality.  Adequate at best.
1,This is way overpriced and not worth the cost. The audio is too low and I am constantly having to reboot my computer because my audio is always going out now. I am losing productivity at my job losing customer calls and this also affects my work. My old Jabra headset I paid 65 bucks for works way better than this I am returning this I would not recommend purchasing it
1,I had to purchase a second pair since WFH because the first pair given to my by my office broke when they fell on the carpet. I just had the earpiece break again just from picking up the headphones with it. The earpieces are attached with a small plastic piece about the size of the point of a marker and that's it! If you pick it up without any force it breaks. I won't buy another set I don't care about the sound quality at this point.
3,I was hoping that for the price the notion of cutting in and out would be reduced or go away completely! No such luck.  Oh and it drives me crazy that i have to adjust the volume EACH time i use it!
5,Great sound. Use it for conference calls and music
4,would like more volume control but the headset is comfortable.
1,Bought these for someone who likes to move when they're on the phone. The person on the other end couldn't hear what you were saying. Kind of defeated the purpose. This was returned.
2,This product is no longer working after a year. Only because the cord at the bottom is now not connecting as well with sound. Should last longer!
4,Wish the microphone extended out further
1,I bought these expecting to finally get a decent headset for video calls.  Nope!  They didn't bother including a filter for the mic the headphones don't fit nicely and as a result the sound quality suffers.  Just get an actual external mic with a boom and call it a day instead of trying to find the perfect headset.  Don't even bother.
1,I wouldn't recommend this product. I purchased 2 of these headsets and the sounds stopped coming out of one ear side 5 months later and the other headset ear stopped about 2 months after. I didn't wrap the cord up or misuse these $100 headsets in any way so it's upsetting they both failed to work.
1,Bought based on a good reviews here. But unfortunately the product i received has sound quality issue and some additional noise.  Tried with my laptop and phone - still the same.  So requested for return. But there is no near-by return locations.  Have to plan a trip to lurinberg to retuen. Sigh...
1,The mute button on the USB adapter no longer works. When you press it the mute light flashes for a couple of seconds and it then remains off. The button no longer works for muting or unmuting the headset's microphone. You have to use the software button on Teams to mute/unmute the headet mic.
5,It's changed the way I work.  The cable is long too so I can turn and use my second desk without getting yanked out of the call.
5,I've gone through a bunch of headsets until I got this one.  Have the larger set for work.  Really comfortable and crystal clear.  Should have bought this in the first place.
5,It works just fine nothing fancy about it
4,Excellent sound quality input/output. A bit uncomfortable on the ear after 30 minutes or so. Pressure on the ears is not adjustable to different head sizes.
2,Microphone is too loud yet if I turn down volume I cant hear others. Plus there is feedback. Works okay. Not great
5,I use this for work as I need to deal with phone calls with clients. This is the best headset ever!
2,I bought this to use a work for meetings via Zoom or Cisco Jabber. I found this headset to be bulky plus the speakers in particular didn't sound very good and the volume didn't go high enough. I returned this and bought the Jabra Biz 2400 Stereo instead. Even though the price of the Biz was much higher it was dramatically better in every way comfort weight and sound quality.
1,The headset is a very very cheap headset that will give you a headache during your workday. The USB link thing is awesome but if you try to plug in your own headset the thing self destructs. It forgets it's Teams certified and you can use any of the buttons.
2,I've had this headset for a year now and the right earpiece has detached from its housing. I'm a moderate to heavy user using it more for phone conversations than for music. The sound quality is fair at best. I would frequently get complaints from people that they could hear an echo whenever I was on. Can't recommend.
5,I'm very surprised by the call clarity and like that I can actually use these with a phone jack when needed.  Very comfy to use for hours too.
5,Very nice sound quality and fits properly for me
1,I used this product for 6 month and the quality of the sound deteriorated other people did not hear me well and stopped working at 6 month mark.The replacement took me several months and I had to pay for the shipment. The replacement product is having similar uses people cannot hear me well.overall BIG NO NO NO NO BUYING THIS!
1,I received these with no box just wrapped in a plastic poly bag. They were broken and the ear piece was covered in what looked to be women’s face foundation makeup.
2,Work OK with Skype for business in our office but they are way overpriced and poor quality. After less then a year the plastic starts falling apart. We originally bought quite a few for our office after a year or so they are all in the bin replaced with a variety of much much cheaper alternatives that seem to work just as well.
5,My customers report consistently good audio quality when I’m on calls. A real step up from regular music headphones for conference calls
5,This has worked well for listening and recording.  I got it to use with dragon naturally speaking and it has done all that I wanted to do without issues with light background noise.
3,Sound and functions as advertised. Not comfortable for extended period of time. Especially with hard frames glasses.
2,The headset is fine but Amazon appears to have sold me a refurbished model as if it were new. The original box was not included and the paperwork was wrinkled. Buyer beware.
4,Some firmware hiccups with the Cisco 8851 but otherwise a great product. Highly recommend.
5,Great product. Makes it very easy to engage and communicate online
5,Great headset. Doesn't put much pressure on your head so it's great to use for an 8 hour call center shift.
5,Great for work!
5,love my wireless lync headset but the batter has limits. Decided to get a wired headset too. Love the unit. good sound (calls and music) and works great with Lync
5,I really love the sound clarity and the long cord
5,helps if you are in sales and make lots of calls from a comp
5,Simply love it. More expensive than other headsets I had but very comfortable well built convenient control pack with mute/unmute.
1,I had to crank up volume to 80-90 while another Logitech I use needs only 20-25. This one is heading back to Amazon. Found online that people experience same thing with this. Contacted Jabra they said the product is out of warranty according to serial number. I might have gotten one sitting at shelf for a long time. Who knows…
5,Son de muy buena calidad y los adquirí a buen precio
5,These work wonders and are great quality.  I just wish they were wireless!
5,Great noise cancellation people on conference calls do not hear back ground noise.
5,We ship these to guests. Easy to use sound quality is good durable. Great value.
5,I love these!  They work great.  Large sound range comfortable on the ears for long periods of time.
5,Clearest headset I have bought in two years.  It is very easy to use during meetings.  Great headset!
1,So we had over 100 of these.  The USB controller is absolute garbage and we've not lost about 40 of them.  They are contact center use and for the price I'm disgusted.  We went to Plantronics and have not looked back.  We have the headsets out as gifts without the controllers since they still sound good but no longer have the ease of use required for all day calling.
5,Comfortable feeling lite weight THE BEST PRODUCT EVER JUST ORDER MORE FOR MY CALL CENTER HOPE THE OTHERS HAVE THE SAME AFFECTED.
1,Try to use it once you receive itin case you need to return
5,Easy to wear
5,I wear these for hours. They are very comfortable
5,Great sound quality for phone and music usage. Decent noise reduction for a non powered headset.
1,This headset stopped working after only three weeks of usage. Others can no longer hear me on a call as the headset goes in and out consistently. They have become useless. Other headsets work fine so not an issue with the computer or port. Look elsewhere for a product that will last a reasonable period of time.
1,I expected this headset to be amazing since I’ve been loyal to Jabra but I was very disappointed. Headset wire came tangled and is already folded. Overpriced and should not be part of the Jabra family.
1,I sent my Jabra headset in for warranty repair. For almost 2 months I still do not have my repaired Jabra headset. I sent Jabra multiple emails - - no response. If you are looking for quality product and good customer service. Jabra is not for you. Caveat Emptor.
5,Clear communication comfortable. I like over the ear headphones for long time use.
5,Excellent  quality
2,These were great for the first six months then they stopped working and now only ork off and on.
5,It is a great headset for conference and video calls.
1,I am sure if it's this particular model or this piece the Mic piece broke in less than a month. I was on the call and tried to move the piece little bit down and it broke. I bought this piece on 2/21 and it broke around 3/15 or 3/16.
2,Had decent sound and I really liked having a call light indicator so my co-workers knew when I was on the phone.  But the audio seemed to go to sleep whenever there wasn't a constant stream of music so not really feasible as a communications device as well as receiving computer notifications.  Plus I could still hear everything going on in the background which was really distracting.
5,This headset is made well and will stand up to everyday usage
3,Not totally noise cancelling
5,I work from home and feel like these have saved me my job.  The microphone noise cancellation is amazing.
5,Works great in low-mid noise workplace environments. Call clarity is very clear and the microphone quality is solid. The buttons built onto the input line work well with Cisco Webex.
5,Great quality and excellent sound.
1,Stops working for various apps--Camtaisia recording Zoom meetings when sharing screen.  Maybe a Windows problem but my other USB headsets all work so in the end it's Jabra failing for me.
1,Really bad for voice calls and even worse for listening to music.  Then last week the plastic connecter/swivel between ear piece and hand hand snapped.  I tried to super glue it back but despite using highest quality adhesive compound the rescue failed.  So out ~$110 (price now is closer to ~$80.  Then today I had to re-order something so gave Jabra a 2nd/last chance and upgraded to Jabra 75.  I'm hopeful that: 1) Sound quality for voice calls improved; 2) That music improves and 3) That build quality is far better than the Model 40.  If not I will return it the next day and never go back to Jabra.
1,1. Mute button did not  work. 2. People on the conference call could hear my typing. 3. I was told that I sounded like I was in a tunnel. 4. My kids told me that the headphones looked like I bought them at the dollar store.
1,It stopped to work as well as the mic is not getting recognized by any OS(Mac/windows) and on any. Software. I am now using it as headphone speaker alone
1,Too small for an adult and my son 12 years old can't fit them. I returned them.
1,Unfortunately they cause high static and clicking boom sounds on the other end. I teach classes on zoom and they are constantly complaining about the sound.I thought Jabra was supposed to be the best. I paid extra to make sure to have good quality but they are junk. They look pretty but they just don't work :(
2,There are so many better mics.  This sounds tin-like.  Hurts top of my head too.  Regret it.
1,Bought these headphones based on reviews that I read. I purchased for my 8 yr old to use for her virtual class. After 2 months of use the right side of the headphones went dead. Only audio comes from one side now. Not worth the $100 for this to happen so fast. Unfortunate =/
1,I was sent a defective Jabra Headset but unfortunately did not use it until after the allowed return date !! So I cannot return to Amazon apparently... But it is hoped Jabra makes this right and sends a replacement. Waiting their reply. I have a separate set for work that functions just fine and that was the reason I purchased this set.
5,Made audio quality MUCH better than previous equipment
5,So comfortable and great sound! Very good value!
3,usb failed within a couple weeks
2,I really only wanted these for the noise cancelling feature which is nonexistent. I work from home and it doesn't help with any background noise. They are comfortable at least but not what I was looking for.
2,Product worked great for 6 months and is failing both on the mike and speakers.
1,It broke after 6 months  I reached out to jabra for warranty and never answered.  It doesn’t worth the money even though sound and volume were ok
5,Love it!
4,Happy I got them.
4,The headphones are great but after a litte time using them they warm up my earns a little too much. Luckily I don't use them all day long like others may do.
1,Acceptable sound and microphone quality for office use but components of the 3.5mm jack separated within 4 months (fortunately not leaving part of the jack inside a device with which it has been used). Since the other end of the wire is integrated into the headset (i.e. not detachable) the headset is now junk (and my wife who bought it for me as a gift is annoyed).
5,Comfortable and great sound
5,Better than expected when ordered!!!!! Ideal for constant use... Highly reliable
1,I've ordered 10 of these for a call center I run and they consistently fail on Windows 10/Mac machines. The USB puck seems to short out after about 3-4 months of use and it becomes a brick...they only part that works at this point is the Headset with the 3.5 standard audio jack connection - our hosted VOIP system requires a USB headset on windows machines. Will be attempting a return on these items.
1,Can't recommend a product that doens't last more than 10 monthes
2,I love the flexibility of a single headset for 3.5mm and USB calls when I travel but after an hour of use they are too painful to keep. The ear pads don't have enough padding but they sounded great and folks on the call said I sounded fine.Returning.
3,They are nice. I expected a little better quality and noise canceling. Easy to use
5,Used it in the office and it has no disappointments so far.
1,Did not come with usb connector.  Had to order this elsewhere and in end cost much more.  Listing was deceiving and did not state this at top and had pictures of usb remote.  Beware and search the listing carefully.  I was going to use this for medical dictation.  Thanks for creating more work for me middle of a pandemic.
5,Wow.  Plugin and start making crystal clear calls.  Comfortable and great quality.
5,Got 2 and every in our office has one. They work well.
1,I just received this and my headset is NOT NEW. I received a used one you can see the where on both pieces that touch the head are worn in and clear use. Disgusting... returning it ASAP!
1,I loved this format with both a USB and audio mini-plug. However the usb dongle suddenly died about a week ago. I've tried contacting customer support via phone and email without success. Still hoping to get warranty support and add stars to my review.A couple of other comments: The ear pad is not terribly comfortably for me but not unbearable. Also a nice addition would be a lapel clip for the headset cable.
1,Purchased for home office use primarily plugged into iPhone. I had the same problem as others that when you move the cord at all it makes a noise in the headpiece.  Jack also caused cracking noise every time it moved in phone.  Also is much heavier than other headsets on the market.  Warranty claim with Jabra was referred back to Amazon which thankfully provided a full refund.
5,Sounds good looks abit different then expected
1,Horrible voice quality. For others it sounds like I am yelling into a fan. I can’t use for Zoom or Skype because others can’t understand me.
1,Product did not work properly after use of 31 days.  Amazon then would not help me to replace because it was over 30 days.  Really 1 day....it is not my fault the headset stopped working 1 day after.  Very disappointed with Amazon.
5,Awesome device I am in sales a lot of calls
1,I read the previous reviews and purchased based on a recommendation from a friend. It did not work for me. I had too many clients say they couldn't hear me clearly or I was struggling to hear. Finally had to return them as I was spending more time either repeating myself or using a different set of headsets.
3,Heavy and bulky.  Wrong size jack for my phone.
5,Great product.
5,Great headphones!
5,Crystal Clear!
1,if i could give this zero stars I would these are expensive and it is impossible to just the mike. the wire breaks easily.
5,So far so good
1,It was painful to wear for more than 30 min. There isn't any padding on the top part and it presses tight. I returned it.
1,Got mine in December for my WFH job. Today the left ear went out. This was the most expensive pair of headphones I have gotten. This is very frustrating.
1,Was attracted to the flexibility of both a USB connection for the computer plus the 3.5 jack for tablets/phone use.  USB connector failed in the middle of a call less than 60 days after purchase and now won't work on any other computer or USB port.  Seller won't take the return so I'm left with an expensive 3.5mm headset.
1,Mic sounds very muffled. Others not able to hear when speaking. Background noise is prevalent in the sound quality.
5,It's a great headset very happy with the product
1,Excellent sound quality until it wasn’t. Use for work so on Monday the 22nd I discovered I could no longer hear the other person. Return period ended on Saturday the 20th. Not a user issue as fails on two laptops and multiple calls and meetings. Did not travel with this and only used in office.
2,sound quality was decent but people on the other end of the phone said my voice sounded like I was under water. also said my voice would sound stretchy at times
1,Not even 6 months the ear pc already broken apart. Disappointed!!!
1,The sound fades in and out. Returning item.
5,Very Good
1,I had it for one month  broke already called customer service didn’t get my Email  correctly  disappointed of the product
3,I really do love these headsets but they don’t stay on your head and as close to your ears as they should I’m constantly adjusting and putting it straight on my head when I have to move
1,USB portion that controls the call such as mute and allow you to hang up stopped working. Worthless
1,This is not a new item! I paid for new not a refurbished headset - will be looking elsewhere for my electronic needs.
5,Bueno
5,Clear for my meetings considering I work remotely and do a lot of meetings
5,Best headset out there
5,Great microphone really reduces surrounding noise for person on the other end of the call.
1,I received the unit in a small pouch. However there was no box housing the product and there were no instructions either. It is hard to tell if the product is new or used. Very disappointing.
5,Great sound and comfort
1,Really disappointing.  I bought these at the end of January and I am extremely careful with them.  They broke already by June!  I would have expected better quality for the price.  Since it has been 5 months since purchase Amazon won't let me return.  Very disappointing!
1,DON'T ORDER THIS ONE!!!!!....There is another one that is Jabra Elite 85h  instead!!!
5,Great product
5,Awwww bummer. I bought this headset in October 2017 when I started a new job. I've worn 'em nearly every working day for close to five years and they've been great. They've been tossed into backpacks time and time again usually inside the carry pouch but not always. Recently I got a bit lazy and a bit careless and the cover has torn free.They still work just fine it's mostly a cosmetic issue at this point and it's only $10 to buy some replacement covers. So despite a few people showing pics of broken head bands and stuff and my own photo with a torn cover I'd buy 'em again and I highly recommend them. If you treat 'em right they'll treat you right.
1,There is no box no manual and no warranty card. This thing came in a bag.
5,as advertised can make your ears hot when worn for an extended period of time
5,Great sound!
1,Broke with in a few months. Just stopped working.
1,System came in a ziplock baggie and no box. Set is only usb and does not have a 3mm jack as advertised. Will not buy again from this vendor.
1,It worked great until it didn’t. I had it for 3months and the USB dongle died in the middle of a call.  It works with just the plain headphone jack but that makes the cord too short.
1,The headset is garbage.  You have to continue to monitor the sound settings so the input doesn't take in the office noise.
1,Answering phone and doing e-learning
5,great for use on a cell phone much better than using the speaker phone all the time
1,Was sent a refurbished headset and paid for a new one.
2,Item did not work on arrival got a replacement.
5,Great headset and meets all my needs.
5,Product delivered as expected and works perfectly.
5,love my headset
1,really bad quality sound. within couple of days of use I am hearing squeaking sound .didn't expect this from jabra
1,No commercial packaging headphone coming in Ziploc bag.The volume control button brings in noises. There're better choices around.
1,Durante algunas llamadas me reportaban que mi audio se iba o era intermitente... procedi a solicitar un reembolso!
2,Quality is great except the ear pieces crack off them after a few months. We have bought dozens of these and they're always breaking.
1,Really cheaply made which is surprising for how expensive these are. Plenty of other brands with much higher quality for cheaper.
1,Disconnects from calls all the time when using the transponder (usb) it sounds like your underwater. Would not recommend for Mac users
5,Great noise cancelling feature!
1,Was great for the few days it worked. Then it just stopped. Support was no help. So easy to return so that was good. A shame.
1,During normal use out of nowhere it stops working randomly during calls.
1,Under 2 years it's broken. I am very frustrated.
1,Only last a little while had to purchase a new on
5,Great headset!
1,DO NOT BUY.  It will not last.  Item broke after only 9 months of gentle use.
1,The headphones have already started to quit. Statically when taking calls on Avaya.
1,It doesn't work with MS teams.  I'm still struggling finding something that does work well with teams.
1,Worked only for a couple of months. Really disappointed after reading all the stellar reviews.
1,Quality. Shorts out. Plug loose.
1,Too bad they fall apart in 30 days
5,works fantastic.  very clear voice
2,Headset broke apart. I used it for 7 weeks. Extremely disappointed.
5,I like the clarity and high quality audio that this product delivers. I do not have a hard time hearing anything and people on the other end can hear me speaking more clearly. I have tried a couple different headsets and these definitely are my favorite yet. They are light weight and simple exactly what I wanted.
5,Works well.
1,Less than 1 star if I could
2,I’ve had a few pairs of these headphones provided through work. They sound quality is great on these - can’t argue that. However like clockwork every 6-8 months the right ear snaps off. I’ve been through four pairs of them at this point. For the price point I would be very unhappy if I were paying out of pocket for these headsets.Looking for a different pair that won’t break on me in six months. It’s cheaper to splurge on a better quality pair than repurchase every 6 months.
5,perfect
5,Great for sound cancelling.
5,Nice
1,Good noise reduction but no mic feedback in headset. You cannot hear yourself when talking
5,Wonderful
3,-If you place the microphone directly in front of your mouth you will get breath pops (plosives). If you position it between your upper lip and nostrils sound quality will be great. The mic does do a good job of rejecting background noise.-If you move the mic up or down while unmuted it will send an annoying crackling sound to the far end.-100% volume is still not that loud. I have the one-eared versions as well and 100% on that is barely usable.-Your audio gets down sampled when using the USB adapter. I don't know to what rate but it feels around 64k. If you are listening to music there is a huge quality dip when using the USB adapter versus plugging right into a headphone jack.
1,My biggest complaint with this headset is that you can't hear your own voice in the speakers.
1,Could not here voice was crackled and delayed..sent it back
5,Excellent product.
1,Microphone stopped working after a six weeks.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             What does this light do?  The volume control I feel like it should be a little louder. And I don’t know if it cancels noise or not.  Other than that the head set is pretty comfortable. I just don’t know what this light does
5,this is what I needed
5,Amazing sound
5,Awesome!!
4,I did not use this exclusively for talking I also use this for a general all-purpose set of headphones. These are not bluetooth enabled but a dedicated USB or mic jack which gives more stars stability to the call and less frequent interference. It is not ideal to just use as a music headset mostly because the microphone would always be there and there are far better ones that are music focused.This one is really designed for business calls or even customer service type of work. There are different levels to this Jabra Evolve set this one for Evolve 40 which gives you the ability to transfer Skype calls to your smartphone and will also give other callers a busy signal. The higher end evolves have more call features so you may need to check the chart to see which one is best for you.I found that using his for calls they were crisp and clear. The microphone picks up my voice without issue and sits in front of my mouth at a comfortable distance and angle. The other person seemed to hear me better than just talking directly through my smartphone. I didn't really play with too many of the features because I dont need to do that just a straight phone call is all I need it for. I also did listen to music with it and was less impressed with the sound but at the same time did not expect the same with it.Overall I like the Jabra Evolve 40 Headset and will continue to use them as when I work on the computer it helps keep my phone free for other purposes.
4,I have used a number of headsets from plantronics and sennheiser but I needed something to work with skype for business which is what led me to the Evolve 40.Comfort: One thing that I do appreciate the most about this headset is the comfort. The pleather ear pads are soft and well-cushioned and do not cause ear pain after a long call.Connectivity: Upon connecting the included USB receiver the headset was immediately recognized by my PC (win 7) and did not need any special drivers. Skype automatically set it as the default device as well. If you want to set it as the default for all applications you will need to adjust this in sound mixer.Sound: This is where I dock the headset one star. I also use it for music occasionally and there is a noticeable lack of bass. It is a communications headset first so I understand but I have never really experienced a headset that cuts bass like this which leads me to think that they have a crossover in place to filter out anything below ~80hz.Microphone: I work in a crowded environment and I have never had issues with noise overtaking my voice. My voice comes through clear and crisp.Functionality: The headset itself can fold flat and has a small magnet that can pull in the microphone to the headband. It comes with a handy carrying case as well for the headset and USB receiver. There are four buttons for initializing a call adjusting volume mute and a toggling the "busy light". This is just an LED indicator on the headset itself to visually show that you are busy.Overall I am satisfied with this headset. It isn't perfect but I imagine they are holding back the sound for the Evolve 80 which seems to be for a hybrid communications/media headset.
4,I recently got a new laptop and given the mobile nature of this machine I wanted to set it up so I plug/unplug as few things as possible every time I take it somewhere.  Eventually I decided I was getting sick of plugging and unplugging from the headphone jack.  Okay it's a first-world problem but what often happened is I forgot to re-plug in the headphones and would end up making unexpected noise.So I wanted a pair of USB headphones the reason being I could just plug them in to the same USB hub that the mouse and keyboard is plugged into.  So now I just have the one plug to attach when I dock my machine.  My machine moves on a daily basis so this is great!These headphones do the job just fine.  They do NOT require any sort of driver install (tested on Windows 7 and OSX).  Audio quality is better than expected I suspect because USB provides power.  The little hand-remote is nice admittedly I rarely use it though since I have the volume controls on my keyboard.  They're also nice and compact.If I had one criticism it's that I cannot find any sort of marking which describes which headphone is left or right.  It's not a big deal after-all this set has a microphone on one side so it's really just a matter of figuring it out once.All in all I dig it and I'm glad to finally be off that headphone jack!
3,I work in an office and use the software Five9 for phone calls which doesn't activate the busy notification like it says it would.  My least favorite thing about them is that they feel cheap they feel like cheap plastic like something I could get for $20 bucks.  They are lightweight and feel flimsy I was really hoping for a sturdier build when paying nearly $100 for a pair of headphones.  They work fine though I can hear clearly and I don't ever have customers complain about not being able to hear me so that is nice. Definitely not noise canceling though I can still hear everyone in the office around me when I have them on my head.
3,I used these three days a week for my work. They were ok but not for the price. They lasted about a year. The junction between the pivotal earpiece and the headband is weak and broke when I put them on.
2,This was given to me so free is good right? Well no. It is one of the more uncomfortable headsets and it continually slides around. There is a sweet spot but I only hit it once or twice a day. As it is used for work I won't spend my time investing in something for work so I'll be living with this. I use other equipment that is more suited for me.I assume people with a lot of hair or very fat heads or round heads will find this comfortable enough. If you wear glasses you may note from time to time discomfort because of your glasses and the way this fits. This isn't for everyone like me but others may enjoy this.
4,I have the wired Evolve 40 set I got at work a while ago to use when my Bluetooth was acting finicky. When I got it at the time it was cheap but I think it's no longer produced and therefore more expensive so probably not worth it now.It's decent enough for what it is. The sound is okay and you can plug it in via USB and it just works.  There's a little control circle at the midpoint of the cord where you can mute or adjust the volume and that's always worked well for me.My biggest complaint however is with the position of this circular control. When I sit at my desk the cord dangles to the floor if I don't put it somewhere and that circular control ends up right on the ground where my foot is. At least once or twice a month I accidentally hang up a call without meaning to because my foot accidentally nudged the hang-up button. I consider this to be an awkward and unfortunate placement for the control and the only thing I really dislike about the unit for what it is.
4,This is nicely designed and works well delivering both decent stereo sound for music listening and good headset capability for phone calls in one package.  The microphone is directional and cancels out background noise well.  The audio is solid (though not as good as a dedicated over ear music headset).Unless you need both in one package I'd probably opt to get better functionality at a lower cost from dedicated music headphones and a dedicated phone headset.  For instance the logitech H390 seems roughly similar for phone calls at a fraction of the price and you can then add a nice over-ear music headset like the mpow for better music sound and the combination is about 60% of the total.At the higher end for a phone headset (not usb) my preference if you want to splurge a little is the plantronics wireless.  Super comfortable (stereo not needed - one ear is less hot) great sound and you can roam around.
5,This is a fantastic headset. Here's what I love about it:1. It fits comfortably on my head. The mouthpiece can be worn on the left or the right and can be adjusted up and down.2. This virtually cancels out the sound that my iPhone usually picks up in the background. This means typing or clicking on my mouse or keyboard and the barking neighbor dog don't come through on my call.3. I used it for a conference call webinar and the quality was great. I plugged it into my Mac mini through the USB port and it worked great with the adapter.4. It also works great on my iPhone. I have been using it for business calls and it is so much easier to take notes or type when I can hear well. And if I need to I can flip the mouthpiece up for a second to speak to someone in the room.5. If this is plugged into my phone and I get a call the ringer chimes on the phone and in the headset. This means that I can still hear the call come in yet leave the headset  plugged in when I am not wearing it.6. The cord is nice and long.7. It includes a padded case.What could use improvement:1. I love that it plugs into a phone headphone jack but without the dongle all volume adjustment has to be done on the computer or phone. It also means you can't answer a call with a button or skip to the next song from the headset. It has to be done from the phone.Other notes: The volume limit was set up on my phone and it actually made it so I couldn't hear anything in the headset. I had to turn this off before it would work. If you plug them in and hear nothing this might be the issue.Overall I am impressed and highly recommend. This has made phone calls and webinars so great for me!
5,These headphones are the most comfortable I have ever owned.  The ear cups sit flat against the ear which feels more natural than the usual headphone with ear cups that surround your ear with a hot and sweaty dome.  I could only handle that style for a while and then my ears needed a cool off to dry out.  If you are using these headphones somewhere loud like a train stop the environment noises will interfere a bit same if you turn the volume up bystanders will hear it.  But the lack of hot and sweaty ears is such a bonus so these other problems are easily avoided.The headphones are instantly compatible with all smartphones with a headphone jack.  I used it on a Google Pixel and on iPhone 5's the sound quality was crystal clear much better than any bluetooth headset I've ever had and I've had plenty.The USB adapter with the call controls worked great for my business calls GoToMeeting Skype for Business and Google Voice.The cord is three feet long perfect for me since I get tired of getting the cord tangled as I pace around during calls but it might be a bit on the short side for some.  For use with the computer the USB adds two feet between the USB port and the controlling buttons.  The cord is round and so far has been resistant to kinks.The volume and mute buttons are on the cord instead of the headset I like this because I don't have to memorize the placement during a call and the indicator light for mute keeps me from forgetting that I have muted a call and no one can hear me because I muted to sneeze cough or shush my cat.The only drawback is that unlike with a bluetooth headset there are no volume or mute controls as part of the headset  or cord when it is plugged into a smart phone.
4,I like the feel and look of the headset it is comfortable clear and easy to use.My issues are:1. The microphone picks up the noise of the locking mechanism when you are adjusting it.2. The mechanism used to adjust the microphone feels a little cheap. Don't get me wrong it works great but for the price of the headset I was expecting it to be a lot smoother.
3,My employer gave me one of these at work. Before the pandemic I used this perhaps 15-20 min at a time occasionally about an hour. Most of the day this just sat on my desk. The sound quality was good—people sounded natural and most importantly there was no discomfort.Fast forward 7+ months working from home and on Teams calls 3-5 hours on an average day my right ear hurts so badly that I actually get a headache (or rather ear ache?) The ear cup presses rather hard on the ear cartilage and it seems it’s just in the side where the microphone stalk is which is on my right ear.In addition the ear cups don’t extend out as far so I have to constantly adjust the down which I think exacerbates the ear pain.Since it plugs into the USB port and the headset itself is a 3.5mm that plugs into the puck I tried another headset. But no the plug where the 3.5mm jack inserts has a rectangular outline that prevents other circular plus from fully inserting.It’s a shame because the sound quality is good for making Teams calls—we all use this headset and people sound as natural as they can get.To help things along I alternate between this headset and using Teams on my phone and using the headset that came with it.
4,If you have a large head these will be a close call.  I just got them and they sound great but the earpiece sits just a little high on the upper part of my ears due to my enormous head.  (My head is just a litter larger than most but I can buy hats its just that most I would pick off the shelf do not fit).  Others should be fine.  FYI - Mine came in a plastic bag but is was all there.  I presume my reseller bought these in bulk for a call center or something like that but its fine as it came with instructions a nice zipper case etc... everything as expected save a pretty box.
5,Convenient carry pouch works with every device in our household....really like the versatility with the removable USB cord for voice music and gaming. The direct cord to hook up to my phone for mobile gaming in privacy or for FaceTiming and Skype comes in quite handy. Very easy to use the USB extension with our gaming consoles. I let my son use it for a little while and he was impressed with the fact that he can use it for phone calls with his dad or keep the boom arm in the up position when he's listening to his music on his phone...he did mentioned that the sound quality is superior to his regular headset. (Enclosed a photo of him using this headset)I think my favorite part of this particular headset versus most others is that it automatically seems to fit my head....not really a need for huge adjustments and it doesn't make my ears itch. I've noticed that with a lot of earbuds they make the insides of my ears itch and become uncomfortable within an hour or so and with a lot of headsets I've tried they either fall out of place or they leave my ears itchy/aching after awhile and these don't have either of those issues. I love them probably the best headset I've ever owned!
4,Headset works great. Very clear audio and having an external volume/mute/hangup pad makes things really easy. Saves hunting for the correct window on the screen to mute and unmute making the conversation flow much easier.The only minor complaint is that the headset wire makes a sound in the right earpiece whenever it is moved. It is not an electrical sound but is almost like a stethoscope where every movement of the wire transmits a physical sound in the right headset where it is attached. I am not sure if people on the other end can hear the wire rubbing on my shirt or collar or the desktop but I sure can.
4,The mic doesn't pick up background noise which is great when you have to WFH with kids.Earpads sit just a bit high even when fully extended. My head is kinda large but I don't usually have a problem with other headsets. Padding on top is almost non-existent it hurts my skull if wearing continuously for over an hour.Sound quality is so-so works fine for video conferencing I wouldn't use these for music.
4,It has the traditional Jabra quality - incredible sound - whether on the computer using USB connection or on the mobile phone using 3.5 mm audio cable. Very comfortable to use.Microphone works very well for speech recognition using Dragon Naturally Speaking. Sound recordings are clear.The volume control and mute button controls work only while connected by USB to the computer; not on the mobile phone on 3.5 mm Jack. That is the main drawback of this headset if you are going to use them with 3.5 audio jack.
4,I work from home and I've been using this headset for about 3 years.  It gets fairly heavy use and I have not had a single problem with it yet.  No one complains that they can hear my breathing the audio is clear no one ever has problems understanding me and they work well plugged into my desk phone (cisco telepresence phone) plugged directly into my laptop or plugged into my iphone.  It's super easy to mute your line or increase/decrease your volume when you are plugged into the little control puck.My daughter steals them to watch youtube kids.  No complaints here.
3,I expected better from Jabra after reading reviews.  I just spent my first day teaching online (video conferencing and internet phone calls) for 5 hours straight and several problems emerged quickly.1. The most annoying issue for me was the location of the microphone boom.  It is literally touching my face and there is no way to adjust the boom in that direction. You can only adjust it up and down. I had to move the boom down by my chin and kept sliding the headphones into an awkward position in an effort to keep the boom off my face.2. If the microphone is close to your mouth loud breathing sounds will be heard.3.  The headset was not comfortable and actually was painful on my ears toward the end of my shift. It's not a good look to be constantly adjusting your headset while on a video conference but that's what was happening between the discomfort and my efforts to keep the mic boom from touching my face.4.  One of the most important features to me is noise cancelling due to fairly loud outside noises in my neighbourhood (loud motorcycles shouting/laughing hammering trucks and dogs barking). Apparently the dogs barking on the street could be heard even though I was in my house on the second floor with all of the windows shut.  Also the alarm on my phone timer could also be heard.
5,This Jabra headset is a super high-end product for the price.  The packaging the neoprene storage sleeve the extra adaptor for USB connection the look and the feel of the unit and the thick rich coating on the wires all add to a super high-end product that is not at a premium price point.  So much attention to tiny detail really impressed me.  Like the click in area for the mic boom when you are not using it it folds up against the head band and then snaps seamlessly into the headband BRILLIANT!The sound is great extra bass picks up all the little extras to make a very rich sound.  Phone calls music or podcasts sound awesome.There is an extra adapter with volume mute and answer all on a round disk attached to the adapter. Round disk has LED indicators to show that you are on the phone.This is my second Jabra headset.  I have an older model one of the first Bluetooth over the ear connection sets and I LOVE that older one.  It still works great after three or four years.I totally trust Jabra and love the way that all the ways you can think of to connect are included.  PC laptop phone or tablet - this will plug right into any device.The fit is customizable and I think it is one of the most comfortable headsets ever.There is also a passive noise cancellation which you don't even notice until you take the headset off.Great product will use these at work for many years to come.
4,The Jabra Evolve 40 UC is a nice package it will work directly with an iPhone/Android phone or through USB to Mac/PC.  The sound is good and the headphones fit over the ear.  The downside seems to be 1) sound is carried to the earphones if you slightly bang the cords around you will hear it in the headset. 2) the microphone has some noise cancelation so it must be positioned directly in front of you mouth not to cut out.I use it daily so it works good with just a few quirks.
5,I tested these using my iPad 5. When I ordered these I was still using iPhone 6 but just upgraded to iPhone 7-plus. Yes I can use the adaptor but I find that inconvenient so am unlikely to use this Jabra Wired Headset with my smartphone.With my iPad though I found the sound quality to be excellent especially while listening to Sons of the Pioneers The Weavers and Wynton Marsalis with his trumpet. Tonal quality superior to the quality experienced through the iPad speakers and generally an improved experience compared to my Amazon Echo.I then listened to an Audible book and was pleased with that quality.The one downside is the feel of the headphones - a bit less comfortable feel than some other headsets except that my ears didn't get quite as overheated with these as with some of the others I've worn.The attached microphone works quite well. I tested it using two free apps downloaded through the Apple Store.I'm between a four and a five star rating. Since I have no good reason to not do so I'm giving the benefit of the doubt to the manufacturer - five stars out of five.I'm planning to soon start a podcast. This should work just fine.Comments regarding your opinion of this book or of my review whether favorable or unfavorable are always welcome. If you buy the book based on my review and become disappointed especially I do want to know that and I want to understand how I can improve as a book reviewer. Just please be polite.Thank you.
3,I overall like this headset.  I use it on my Windows 10 Enterprise Desktop with Bria 4 from CounterPath.  My biggest complaint/issue is with the Jabra Link.  I plug it into my computer and initially it works the Link shows the lights on it and if someone calls it flashes and works as it's supposed to.  However after a short while the Link will stop working.  The lights on it will not light up the mute doesn't work I can't press the button to answer/hangup calls.  I can still control the volume but that's it.  The solution is to unplug the USB and plug it back in again then it works.The other issue is with the volume.  If I go a few minutes of using the headset without any sound or anything being active on my computer it seems that the Link "sleeps" or "turns off" and I can't control the volume.  Then when something on my computer makes sound (like if I decide to start playing Spotify or a call comes in) I'll hear a "clicking" noise in my headset as if the headset/Link is turning on then I can hear the sound fine (although I've literally missed about 1-2 seconds of the beginning of whatever that sound was) and can then control the volume.  I hope this paragraph makes sense.I have updated the firmware/software completely so it's all up-to-date and I adjusted power settings so that the USB ports don't turn off/sleep.  These did not solve the problem.I've tried to contact support regarding this issue and they haven't been very helpful.  They actually have not even responded to my second inquiry at all regarding the Link seemingly going to "sleep" and I put in a support request a week or two ago.  I'll of course try again but their support does not seem to be super responsive.Other than these issues I like the headset.  They are comfortable and work well.  And when it works I like the Link.  I just wish it ALWAYS worked without me having to unplug it and plug it back in again.
5,In Zoom meetings people always say I sound better than people in the room these are excellent for anyone who does a lot of zoom calls (or any other conferencing software)They are also very good for music the audio quality is much better than any other headset my company has ever given me. At home I use some very nice Senheisser Momentum headphones which sound great but honestly these come really close.I never use the controls. I used to use them exclusively on the audio jack but to not get in the way of my mouse I tried the usb connection and it worked great so stuck with that. These headsets work just as well with either the usb option does give a little extra length to the cable for reaching around during meetings.As others have said the mic has good noise cancelling so others can't hear your background but the speakers don't offer any noise cancelling at all - that's someone in the Jabra marketing department getting a little too liberal with the phrase "noise cancelling". They are noise cancelling in the same way that wearing a hat is.
4,Solidly made headset which can be used via USB or 3.5mm jack.  I like how this integrates so well with Skype and I find it very portable and easy to throw in my bag with my laptop.  I have used Jabra products in the past and find they are high quality.**** RECOMMENDED
5,Wow - I just finished a call with this headset sitting in an environment flooded with so much white noise that the people around me have to talk loudly to hear each other... but the people on my call were able to hear me clearly when I talked at a very normal level and I could hear them clearly.I'm using a Samsung Chromebook with the headset plugged into the USB connection.  For communications I'm running Microsoft Teams inside a Chrome browser window.  Was able to use both voice and video over WiFi and it was very clear.The location is one of the tents at Gartner Symposium (by the Dolphin hotel in Orlando) and the white noise is coming from the intense A/C that's being pumped in here to offset the heat and humidity.I've had this headset about a year (got it through work not Amazon) and have only used it a couple of times a month but this is the first time I've used it in a noisy environment and it hugely exceeded my expectations.
3,My work got me this. The band has no padding and somehow the plastic feels super hard. They are not lightweight. They squash my ears (which don't stick out to begin with). Feel lightweight and cheap. Sound and microphone quality are just ok they don't match the price in my opinion. Connection options (usb or aux) are convenient. Red color is kind of distracting IMO. I've never had a problem with headphone bands but I will be adding some padding to this to make it bearable.
4,These are perfect headphones for making calls or for use with voice recognition software.  Comfortable with excellent functionality.  They are not suited for music.  If you're need is voice related then these are highly recommended.
5,It was a nice head set but too big to adjust to my head sorry
5,A breathable wired USB on-ear stereo headset with mic was exactly what i needed and this fit the bill nicely. I didn't expect to be shelling out so little for such good sound quality but the sound is really decent even for listening to music. Noise cancellation isn't much but still makes an appreciable difference. The volume control box on the cord is gimmicky and I have no need to use it but it works fine. I'm an online teacher and the headset looks slick on Zoom calls. It's super light and doesn't collect sweat on long calls. Recommended!
3,This is a good headset for using with voice call software. That is the main advertised feature of the headset. I like how clear the microphone is for voice calls. The headphones are good but they are very low volume. I have to turn the volume up way higher than I normally do for my headphones when I am wearing this headset. The mic is not flexible so the mic goes right up to your face and I often worry that people will hear me breathing when I wear this. The mic arm swivels either way so you can put the mic on either side of your head.The headband does not expand very far so if you have a big head this may be a challenge to fit. The cable for this headphone comes in two parts; there is a 3.5mm part that connects to the controls and then the USB cable comes out from the controls and can be plugged into any USB port. So you can use this with either a USB or 3.5mm connection. The headphones also comes with a carrying case and you can download some drivers from the Jabra website to add modest functionality.I think these headphones are good but the price is very inflated for what you get. I can get much better headphones for a similar price. I would wait until the price goes down to get these
2,I have used this Jabra Evolve 40 stereo unit for a few weeks in a home-office setting after purchasing from Amazon. Initially I was very excited but after some wear I've found I cannot use these.In summary:* Great audio quality* Desktop mute button with volume control is great* High quality build* A complete fail since they are not wearable for more than ~1hrThe audio quality (both sound you hear and microphone that others hear) is amazing and so much better than any other headset I have tried. For that I wish I could give this 6 stars it is exceptional and the reason I originally chose this unit and even reccomended it to others in my office.The desktop button unit is perfect for having handy access to the mute button (for conference calls) and seeing at a glance if I'm currently on mute or not changing volume etc.The cables are all high quality and a little stiff but in the way that makes it clear they won't get easily broken from lots of use. The build of the unit itself is high quality and it feels nice with attention to detail.Even when expanded to maximum size the unit is too uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes without some discomfort. I wear XL hats so my head may be larger than most but the earpads are pushing quite hard on my ears. And when shifting them forward more onto my face in front of my ears it feels like it might fall off. After 2 hours it is painful and I have to take them off the rest of the day. It has made me re-think the "on-ear" design for me as the other headphones I own that I like are mostly "over-the-ear" style noise canceling etc. I will see about returning theseIn summary these are a great choice if you have a smaller head and like "on-ear" earpiece style. If you have a larger head I suggest trying other units.
3,Very nice features but the constant crackling is now on the 2nd pair.  I thought it was isolated but it isn't.  The crackling happens across all applications.  Bummer.
2,We had two of these at home for two adults. Carefully handled but still  both broke at the same place. We never buy again.
2,I've used dozens of headphones headsets and Bluetooth audio devices over the years and I've had good luck with most Jabra products. I use a high end wireless mono Sennheiser headset for work. I also have a cheap USB headset for personal PC calls but I hardly ever use it. When watching videos or listening to music I switch between a variety of corded and wireless headphones that I have in my collection (not headsets). I was excited to try the Jabra Evolve 40 UC headset because I thought it might kill two birds with one stone for me but whereas the headset functionality is good I find the sound quality for music listening to be very poor.First off this is a wired USB stereo headset. The 3.5mm cable on the headset itself attaches and detaches to/from the control puck. The puck has the USB cable permanently attached and basically acts as your sound card when you plug it in. Since the 3.5mm cable can be disconnected you can use it with other devices like your phone. When you connect it via USB to Windows 10 it shows up as a speaker device (Jabra EVOLVE LINK). PC calls sound fine and the mic seems to work well enough. For headset only devices I usually prefer mono headsets so I have a free ear to listen to my surroundings but stereo headsets are nice too so you can focus better on the calls without the distractions from your environment. The Evolve 40 UC can handle that without any complaints from me. The earpads are a little small but comfortable. The control puck is responsive and lets you mute calls easily. It's a versatile USB headset. But with the marketing about how great it's supposed to handle music I was expecting better sound quality.I played music through both my PC and my mobile phone and neither sounded good at all. The Evolve 40 UC sounds about as good as headphones/earbuds that are included with music devices or phones which is to say that they're actually pretty poor. The sound is muffled and lack detail. The low end sounds artificial without any punch. I'm sorry but there's just no way I can say that the Evolve 40 UC sound "amazing" with music. My experience is quite the opposite. I wouldn't be so disappointed about this except that Jabra touts how great they should be and it's priced like a premium-sounding headset. I can't recommend the Evolve 40 UC for music and at over $100 it's not a good value.
3,I've used these headphones for work and the noise cancellation since I work from home.  They work great for that purpose.  I've loved these headphones and the sound quality but the build quality is terrible.  There is a small connection above the ear piece that connects to the over head piece.  This piece breaks easily and renders the ear piece a floppy mess.  If you will travel with this headset or think you'd be hard on it for any reason purchase something else.  I've broken two copies of this headset myself and I'm moving on.
3,Hi  I want to say this is a good headset.  Not sure the $100+ is justified but does things pretty well. The biggest issue i have encountered is with the cord.  While it is a cool red cord (will show dirt in time :( ) the biggest issue is with how stiff it is.  You want the cord to be pretty flexible. That it is not.  Thus gets curled up and gets in the way
5,Love these headphones. First this is a very comfortable headset and it really does a great job cancelling background noise. Which is definitely key when you’re trying to avoid distractions while working. We have a phone integrated skype service for work and this headset works beautifully for skype conferences – much better than the simple (other brand) headset I used to use. Also the microphone is crystal clear when you’re speaking if anything I have to angle it away from my mouth a little to keep the sound of my voice as clear as possible. My latest use for these my favorite use is for voice-overs for some of my videos. Honestly there is nothing else out there that had rivalled this headset and microphone at this price point. This is a truly awesome set.
5,This is what you need if you are spending all day on zoom calls. Much more comfortable than in ear headphones and produces crystal clear sounds
5,I initially utilized these with my cell phone in my home office. I REALLY dislike when someone calls me and places things on speakerphone. The sound quality on their end is just plain terrible. I called my wife with this headset. She stated that it sounded like I was standing next to her. Great.Typically when doing yard work I used earbuds. Still much outside noise turn the volume up the whole way.  Tuesday I was expecting a call yet had to blow the leaves into a pile. Decided to utilize my Jabra 40 to listen to tunes and wait the call. Best choice I could have made. GREAT sound quality on the tunes when the call came in flip off the leaf blowing device flip down the mic I'm in business. I just bought another Jabra 40. Nice stuff.
5,This is more of an anti-bluetooth post but I think that part of the reason people text so much is that cell phone calls are so low quality. Some of the companies are addressing this with HD calling but in general the call quality is terrible. That brings me to Bluetooth. We love the convenience of wireless but at every point you add a step to the cell call process you lose quality and you get a delay. So when you add it all up poor call quality to start with signals bouncing off cell towers bluetooth delay/degradation and even wi-fi delay and you have a mess. It is just hard to communicate much of the time with these miraculous devices we all carry.That leads me to this headset. Wired eliminates an additional wireless delay. The sound quality is excellent and it is very comfortable. If you call the same person from the same place using bluetooth and this this will win hands down and the person on the other end will want you to call with this headset every time. I know this seems like a step backwards but if we all used these we would text less and communicate a whole lot better.
1,I bought the Jabra EVOLVE 40 to replace my Jabra BIZ 2400's I've had for about 6 years now. I figured it was time to upgrade and went with the Jabra EVOLVE 40. I opened the package and immediately they felt cheaply made. I plugged them in put them on and the microphone is pretty much in your mouth with no way to adjust it outward. Then the worst most garbage part was when I used them...the sound quality is worse than... well I don't even know what they're worse than. It's awful. My 6 year old headset sounds 100 times better than these. It's just total garbage. I was so disappointed especially after 6 years of loving my old Jabra headsets. Just sad at how cheap they feel and how horrific the sound quality is all while trying not to choke on the mic that's against your mouth.
5,I didn't buy this from Amazon; as my company paid for it.  The reason was that my voice was very hard to understand.  This headphone does wonder.  Voice comes across clear now.I am in a quiet home office so I don't have a need for noise cancellation.  Nice part is that you can use with the computer or on mobile phone or anything with the 3.5 mm jack.  It is a stereo headphone so you can listen to music.  I don't use the headphone for that. There are cheaper option available that sounds just as good.
5,For long conference calls at home on my cellphone often with international business partners where the connection is poor the Jabra Evolve headphones are great.  They aren't the headphones I reach for when I want to listen to music or to cancel out noise on a plane but for their intended purpose they beat stock earbuds and Bluetooth headsets by a large margin.They are very comfortable for extended conference calls have a good quality microphone and the speakers are well calibrated for voice conversations.  Due to the increased clarity I have a much easier time understanding people through fuzzy connections or difficult speech when using these headphones.  I also appreciate that this corded version does not require pairing or batteries.  Trying to pair your headset when someone calls you or dealing with battery issues during a long call are both just the worst.
3,I bought my Jabra 40 in person at best buy 6 months ago. Yesterday the USB-Connected little pad in which you connect the headphone jack lit up twice and went dark. I lost audio capabilities even though the microphone continued to work. The USB connector is dead. I can still use the headphones without it but I did not expect it to fail.
1,Got this headset from my employer so we could communicate while working from home. I honestly have never heard anything sound so bad that wasn't bundled for free with something. Yes this 100$ headset is on par with the audio quality you could expect from the earphones you used to get with your cellphone. The sound quality is so bad that when I tried to listen to them I couldn't even listen through an entire song. The sound is muddy lacks detail and bass as you can expect from such tiny drivers.I wouldn't say I'm an audiophile but I do enjoy good sound quality and while I do have a dac/amp it only powers entry level headphones (Topping MX3 Philips SHP9500). It's pointless to compare the two even if the SHP9500 is cheaper (~70$) they couldn't be more diametrically opposed. The thing is I have a pair of 13$ Chinese in-ears (Rock Zircon) that are far superior to them as well. I get it these are not meant for music or gaming these are for VOIP and nothing else but why do they cost 100$ then?!The mic could be broadcast level (doubt it). They could be extremely comfortable for long sessions (again highly doubt it). Alas utterly irrelevant with the audio quality they provide. No one should subject their ears to these. If anyone thinks the audio quality on these is good enough well they're wrong but that subjective. What isn't subjective is that they made a bad deal since most 50$ headsets would likely sound far better. If these where in the 30-40$ range I'd give them 5 star but 100$ just no.IF YOU CARE ABOUT SOUND QUALITY - DO NOT BUY THESEIF YOU DON'T - DO NOT BUY THESE BECAUSE THEY ARE OVERPRICED.
5,After a couple of weeks of use the Jabra Evolve has replaced my previous Jabra Revo headset which I have enjoyed but are dying after many years of use.The boom mic of the Evolve picks up better than the integrated mic on the Revo. Sounds quality of the speakers as on par. Not high-end bass-heavy but perfectly adequate for anything you're doing at work.I'm on the fence about the control pod being placed on the desk instead of the headset. It works well enough but it one more thing I have to find a space for. Given a choice I would have placed the controls on the headset. I understand though that in a business/call center environment there is an advantage to having this base station where different users can plug their headphones into.Jabra continues to lead this market and to provide enough variety in their product lines to accommodate varying tastes and budgets.
3,I'm confused at the other rviews. It's a nice small package with a mic that's pretty decent --- however there is almost ZERO noise cancellation. ZERO. Or maybe it just lets 95-99% of sound through. This is fine if you want to still hear/ talk to others while listening to music or whatever. You want noise cancellation though? Look elsewhere.The MIC might be good at blocking ambient sound. The ear cups however do not. You will be doing a favor to those on the other end of the line but not yourself when it comes to drowning out ambient office noise.
5,I didn't expect to love these as much as I do.  I work from home and am on calls most of the day.  The audio is incredibly clear on skype as well as regular cell calls.  The "passive noise cancellation" isn't really a thing in my opinion. You can still hear plenty and I found I just talk a little louder because of it.Beyond that I was expecting so-so to decent quality for music.  I was blown away they really do sound like a nice pair of headphones.  If you spend a lot of time on calls and are looking for a wired headset you should absolutely pick these up.  I have been blown away by them.
1,Very disappointed as my 1st headset -- which altogether was very comfortable and with great sound -- broke within 2 months of use: the right ear part disconnected from the headband part.That's due to a flimsy connection between those 2 parts viz. just a wire which quickly becomes loose and then severs.Jabra only sends out replacements they don't issue refunds and they don't pay for postage to mail the defective unit back.I went through the somewhat involved return process and my replacement headset which took A WHILE to arrive recently broke also within 2 months of use also AT THE VERY SAME SPOT!!!The tech support person acknowledged that there was an issue in the design and that it had been fixed in the next version.But still no offer to refund or replace defecrive headset with a working model.I'm getting my bank to refund me for the purchase and I'm buying somewhere other than Jabra for sure.Conclusion: DO NOT BUY
5,I own the Jabra UC Voice 550 a Plantronics Audio 326 Stereo PC Headset and a hodge podge of other headsets and this is the CLEAR winner. Consistent clear sound with background noise minimization every time. No problem using Skype Hangouts or other web conferencing software. Simple and easy plug and play use. Headphones are very comfortable and feel very lightweight while still providing background noise cancellation.Easy to clean and comes with a handy carry case for travel. Easy to clean and made with quality parts no cheap feel or flimsy plastic anywhere.Don't waste your money on other products like I did. This is a clear winner.
1,My employer bought a bunch of the 2 speaker Evolve 40 UC models for us to use on conference calls late last year. I absolutley LOVED this product as it was super comfortable and worked flawlessly for both business and playing computer games.Then the speaker+microphone assembly broke off where it attaches to the rest of the headset! I looked closely and saw that the design/connector is really weak. I then looked online and saw the the Evolve 65 model had the same flaw and several people mentioned them breaking at the exact same spot (in fact there are at least 2 photos showing the exact same conneciton failure in the Amazon ratings.) It is a real shame because if they had just made this a little tougher/more rugged this headset is a world beater. So far I was able to use some super-glue (a type specifically targeted at platics) and it has worked fine for a couple of days now (and I am REALLY being careful to not put any stress on this set when I take it on and off or move around.) I've tried to find a viable replacement but nothing else I've tried comes close to the performance of these. I wish Jabbra would come up with an improved model where the only thing that changes is a stronger attachment.  :(
3,Great sound quality and comfort poor quality of product.  One ear piece broke out of the head band after about 6 months the other on its way out now.
2,I ordered these headphones for working remotely and Jabra is usually a good brand. However these headphones glitch constantly and it's really annoying. I'll be on a video call or listening to a recording and I will hear a low loud glitchy sound. It's sporadic but happens a few times + each day. Additionally sometimes when I'm on a meeting the headset just mutes up so I can't hear anyone and they can't hear me. I have to unplug the headset from my computer and then plug it back in to get it to work. These are BRAND NEW. I haven't even had them a month. I'm not sure if the quality is just not good or if they are defective.
1,The Jabra Evolve 40 unfortunately stopped working properly after only one month. I’ve received complaints about my voice cutting in and out. Very disappointed with the quality of the product based off price.
2,These do NOT stay on my head.  Every time I look down even slightly they slide off.  I've seen some of the higher end models that look like they probably stay on better and I've read other reviews where people specifically say that these do NOT slide off your head.  I've never previously had this issue with ANY headsets (even old walkman headsets from the 80's) so this seems like a really stupid problem to have.  And not sure what to make of other people who specifically refute the claims of them falling off people's head unless Jabra has some significant discrepancies in their manufacturing materials etc.
1,Sound quality is ok but they are actually painful to wear.  The problem is that there is no padding on the top of the headset.  This means that if you have the top of the headset touching your head you have a hard piece of plastic digging into your head.  10 cents of padding would have made all the difference in the world.  Without it unusable.
5,I plugged this headset into my computer and was then blown away by the sounds I was hearing. These headphones are exceptional. They reproduce sound exceptionally well. There was no setup it was plug and play.
2,This is really uncomfortable. I have never thought of myself as having a small head but even on the smallest setting this sits about 1/8" above my head which means I'm constantly adjusting it. It slides off my ears. I'm going back to ear buds because I can't stand it.
1,We are required to use these in my office.Sound quality is decent. Setup is fairly easy. They are NOT noise cancelling.Bluetooth version is extremely unreliable. Don’t waste your money.Wired version is pretty good.  However I have had to replace mine every month or two because the overall quality is terrible. Within a month sound quality badly deteriorates and they start turning themselves off randomly multiple times per day. This is extremely problematic when in meetings or (worse yet) leading presentations with leadership shareholders or trainees).For this price I would expect far better longevity.Save yourself the trouble buy a cheap pair of headphones or earbuds that include a mic.
5,This is good quality headset. Calls are easy to hear and fit is comfy.
3,This product integrates well with VOIP programs and has quality sound but the construction of the headband is cheap. If you have a large head it will likely break in multiple places.
5,I have this headset for work. I use it with Skype/Microsoft Lync. I love it. It seems to cancel the office noise (co-workers kids etc.) Sound is clear. The receiving end hears me clearly each time. I love using it with Skype as it's our company standard.
2,These are not worth the money. If listening to music the bass sounds terrible and weak. Comfort wise these are pretty nice but make the ears a bit warm. They look better than they are. If you want some good sounding PC headphones for taking calls listening to music or maybe even PC gaming check out these. My company used these before we got the Jabra's and I already miss them.Check these out - - - - - >  Plantronics 204446-01 Blackwire C325-M Headset
2,Ive had 3 pair because they've broken. Also no noise cancellation- pretty annoying working from home but my job provides so what can I say
5,Great UC headphones. Love to use these when I need to concentrate on a call or on work while I listen to music. Really productive products.
3,So these were used awhile ago and I do not think they were that spectacular..  That is the most difficult thing about writing reviews is that if the item does not leave a mark it is just okay.  I have had better headsets.
1,This product has very little noise cancellation.  If you work in a call center any noisy coworkers and bosses will overpower the small Jabra headphones.  The situation is worse if the other on the phone is speaking softly or if it is a soft connection.
1,Our enterprise has hundreds of these.  We have at least 1-2 a week break.  It's to the point that Jabra/Cisco have said it's an issue.  They are so bad Jabra told us to stop sending them back and they just send us new ones.  We have gone through at least 20 this year alone.
5,This headset does a great job of keeping my focus on the call even in super noisy environments like my office.  I can finally stop yelling at everyone to keep it down.  Also without disconnecting the entire device from your computer you can unplug the earphones portion and use them on your mobile phone.  That's great for when people call me on the wrong number.
1,6 months after purchase the ear pads fell apart. Called them and they want $50.00 for new ear pads. That’s for a ten pak. Ya think there’s a problem with the ear pads? Worst customer service ever. I replaced them with the Boise and haven’t looked back since.
1,These are hot garbage. The extremely average mic is the best thing they have to offer. It's very sensitive and will pick up background noise if you work in an open floor plan office but it's clear enough.Sound quality is really terrible. On par with a $5 set of headphones. If you listen to music in addition to making calls you will hate these.Zero noise isolation - you will hear everything going on around you.The moveable ear pieces never sit comfortably on your ears. Moveable ear pieces only really work on headsets where the earpieces completely cover your ears and have something to anchor them not with small ones like this.The in-line control piece is bulky and in a weird place on the line. It falls off my desk if I move at all but doesn't hang comfortably either if I keep it off the desk entirely.
1,This product worked fine until they broke in my work bag. See how one of the headphones just snapped off...Jabra products are not well-built and they are EXPENSIVE. I would return or use the warranty but I can't find the receipt.  Help Jabra!
2,This headset's microphone/speakers work reasonably well and I appreciate the functionality that its controller affords. However The plastic portion of headset band is breaking about a year into its use. I can likely epoxy this band to fix it temporarily while I look for a replacement headset that will not break after a year of use.
2,I found this headset to be quite uncomfortable after using it for only 5-10 minutes.  It is an on ear headphone and my head is average size.  But there is too much pressure on my ears that leads to the discomfort coupled with the padding not being very soft.  In terms of call quality it is pretty good but I just don't want to wear it which is why I do not recommend it.
5,I am very pleased with this product. The noise cancellation is very good. I use it in a shared office and it is comfortable to run calls now. The remote disk makes it very convenient to use. On my laptop with Windows 10 worked immediately after plugging in. Would bu again.
1,Though they have a 3.5mm slot on their USB adapter (that round box). They intentionally designed the standard 3.5mm plug to be squared instead of round. Standard earphone with a mic such as those Bose ones cannot plug into their box due to this design. I would say it is a bad design intention to prevent people using anything rather than Jabra.
5,We use a lot of Jabra product at work and this time I got this one and it has an excellent voice quality and mic noise canceling.I use it for e-meetings during events at show floors and it worked just perfect.
1,it doesn't work on my macbook air
1,This headset gave me TMJ.
1,These are just awful in so many ways.  My company issued these to everyone and I hate them.  First off the volume on my computer needs to be at almost maximum to hear anything with these and I have tried on multiple computers to make sure it wasn't just my laptop.  The headphone jack doesn't work with airline headphone jack ports.  The first time I thought it was just the jack on the plane but no. Noise reduction is minimal.  Oh and my first pair physically broke and I had to get a new one. My $30-$40 logitechs are better.
1,hurts my ears after about 20 minutes of using it and definitely not worth it for the price
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The Jabra Evolve 40 is a fine headset with comfortability  and great sound quality. When plugging it into my computer via usb it provided great sound for broadcast and recordings. Skype calls were great. The on desk controls to mute and control volume and answer calls was convenient. However you can pull your 3.5mm plug from this control and put into most smart phones (I can't without an adaptor to the iPHone 7plus but if you can you lose the ability to control the phone through the headset with the exception of Mute. An unfortunate design in my opinion as this requires you to keep the phone in hand at all times.My ears started hurting after about 20 minutes and this did not happen with the Jabra 75's.
1,Delivery was fine but seriously why did it come in a bag and not the original box? I paid for a brand new item not a used or refurbished item. If that's what I wanted then I would have selected it and gotten a discount right? Now I'm going to have to return it and keep searching for another headset and may even buy elsewhere so that I don't have to risk getting something I didn't pay for.
5,This product includes a junction box that allows you to use it with multiple devices. Sound quality is excellent very clear as I would expect from digital. The junction box also has the sound level adjustment buttons which are convenient to use. Calls to the manufacturer's support department prior to purchase convinced me that this outfit is a first-class manufacturer that fully supports its products.
4,The sound and mic quality are very good.  I replaced a long used and abused USB based head set and this is a good replacement.  I lift and set down my head set probably ten times a day.  I love the feature where the mic folds away as the ear cup rotates to lay flat.  This will definitely extend the life of this head set.My only complaint is fit.  I have a larger head and the fit is acceptable but slightly awkward.  The ear cups shift during calls and I sometime have to adjust them.  I decided to keep the headset nonetheless because the few cheaper alternatives I tried did not work very well with respect to sound or mic quality.  I suspect someone with a smaller head won't experience the challenges I have with fit.
5,I originally had purchased a lesser expense bluetooth headphones but the sound quality was horrible.  I quickly return those and decided on these after reading the reviews.  Not disappointed.  A solid set of headphones.
5,I tried 4 different headsets -starting with the cheap ones and none of them were great. This headset while a little more than the cheap ones is worth it - comfortable clear mic and speakers options as to what kind of plug you use easy to mute all very good!
2,The mic does not have a volume control at least when attached to phone system.  On the phone 90% of my day and have multiple people tell me they can't hear me.  Very disappointed for the money spent.
5,This is a cool headset that integrates well with teams. There’s a do not disturb button on the control puck and also a handy green phone light that pulses when it’s time to join a Teams meeting. Hitting that button launches the meeting entrance window - no more searching around open windows on your desktop to hit Join or missing the notice that someone else has started the meeting. Good purchase.
3,The sound quality is great but they aren’t very sturdy and I am afraid I will break them. Also they made my ears hurt after wearing them for a long period of time.I will stick to around the ear from now on.
4,My head is too big or headset is too small. Mic pokes into my mouth. Lol
5,This headset replaced an older Jabber set and I immediately could tell the difference in hearing callers and my voice being clearer for callers.  Easy to install.  Sturdier than previous models.  Comfortable to wear.  Easier to use.
5,They don't irritate my ears after when wearing them all day but the controls on the "remote" part only work for teams meetings not for phone calls. They do not cancel noise at all.
5,The puck controller is fantastic. The ability to easily mute your self is great. Sound quality is perfect. Would absolutely buy again.
5,Perfect in every way.
5,Great headset with really good sound quality.  Very lightweight and comfortable to wear.
4,Replaced my Logitech headset with these and very happy with the results.
5,It is excellent. Not bulky and has a mute button.  I've been using them for teaching virtual classes while my kids are making noises and it cancels the noise. Highly recommended.
5,Best quality no disturbance..I would highly recommend this headset.
1,Do not order this from Amazon. Mine showed up in a plastic bag. It's pretty obvious it was refurbish or something. I'm returning immediately.
5,Working from home
5,Love the noise cancellation and they are comfortable.
5,I wanted headphones that had excellent sound isolation to me and my voice and that would cut out the noises and voices around me. These do exactly that. The microphone allows my voice to come through loud and clear and it correctly filters out my wife's voice as show talks on another computer behind me. Between the directional mic and the noise canceling it works great. I also like that I can unplug them from the volume and mute controller and then plug them into my telephone. They are pricy but the cheaper ones I have trid just do not isolate my voice adequately. In this case you get what you pay for.
3,After reading reviews about this product and having experience it myself I'm better off with using the general earbud headsets that came with my Samsung Galaxy and Apple iPhone.The story goes I wanted a high-end headset but it had to come with a 3.5mm plug so I can insert it into my laptop's headphone/mic combo jack or my phones. I looked up recommendations for "top headsets" but they often came with USB plugs. However I noticed that the Jabra Evolve 40 can unplug from the USB adapter so I was interested. Found a used one on Amazon ($40) that ONLY came with the headset and not the USB adapter. I thought "perfect". Turns out the USB adapter probably has a built-in preamp so without it the volume on the mic was VERY QUIET even on max volume and max mic boost settings. Everyone on the other side of my conference calls could barely hear me. I only made it "sort of" work by force bending the mic arm right to my mouth (almost eating it) which is another flaw of the headset because the microphone arm is not bendable at all. It just swivels up and down. I didn't want to break the arm so I had to track down a USB adapter on eBay ($25) and waited for that to come in. Now I'm stuck with the very thing I wanted to avoid using. A USB headset.I'm dreading the day the USB adapter fails because that's probably why the vendor that sold me the headset in the first place didn't have it. Not to mention various reviews on Amazon had users mentioning that this is the first piece to go. Also the cable quality at the neck of the plugs could use a revamp because it looks like mine is beginning to break. QA could definitely use some work.Pros:- better than my laptop mic in terms of noise isolation. For those who know about microphone terminology it acts as a "dynamic mic" instead of the laptop's "condenser" mic.-headphone cushions are soft and squishy-the headphone portion sounds great for voice. Takes out the muffle so I can clearly hear someoneCons:-inflexible mic arm (if you move it in front of your mouth you can hear breathing. If you move it below you risk the arm scraping against your chin and they will hear your jaw brushing against the mic arm) they should have included a foam tip-if you use the 3.5mm plug by itself it's near silent. Pretty impossible to use the headset without the USB adapter.-no bass. If you're expecting some "bring down the house" bass with these headphones then you can forget about it. I think these were designed only for conferencing
5,They were fast with delivery.  I actually love them the first pair of headphones that I can plug in and listen to and also hear when someone is speaking with me directly.  I use the for work.
5,I don't understand the negative reviews of this headset. The ear cushions are so comfortable that it doesn't hurt my ears at all. I wear it for 7 hrs a day. Super comfortable fit doesn't hurt or give me a headache. I've tried other headsets before & I fell in love w/this one.
4,I bought the MS certified version I use them with VoIP and over 8hrs at a time. Sound quality is very good as is microphone for others hearing me. The headset definitely cancels you from hearing a lot of background noise or co workers or whatever noise there could be so you do hear other person good.My issues are I have a large but not super large head 7 3/4 size hat the headset fits just  okay but the way the crossbar is that is non bendable there is space on both sides of head that it bows out wasted space and if it would bend would fit much better. Other issue is the volume control that the wires plug into is unnecessarily heavy and I can see with time if you don’t put that on your desk or support it somehow it will cause wire strain and connection issues.Overall even with those 2 faults it feels pretty solid and seems of good quality.EDIT— update the noise cancellation of what others can not hear as far as background ground noise is actually really good providing you position the mic properly I have a radio speaker playing in background granted at only a decent level we record all calls where I work and it was not audible at all very good.Summary if headset was either bigger or fit big heads better and I would like both the callers audio and the mic pic up to be louder this would be 5 stars as is very good.And yes I know how to adjust and do all the levels but even at max both could be better.
5,The sound quality is clear and the mic is great for what I use it for (Dragon voice recognition). Great purchase
5,One of the options on this review asked about Noise Cancellation. This model does not have noise cancellation. It does however have great sound and a great microphone. The photos of the earpieces looked like they were hard and that worried me. They are a very soft cushioned ring around the ear so don't be put off from the pictures. The red light comes on when you press the center button on the wired remote but not automatically. The remote can be removed and used in a normal headphone jack.
4,I’m on my 2nd pair of these headsets - I love them and I’m not at all careful with them. I appreciate the durability. I also appreciate that I don’t have to figure out how to make his work on teams with os software.The main reason for this review is that Amazon used to deliver this in a box. It clearly states on this page “What’s in the box”. As you can see from my photos this does not come in a box.  When I first received it I wondered if it was used / refurbished so I contacted customer service who understood why I seemed to be a little freaked out by receiving my headset in a ziplock type of bag. They arranged for a replacement. The replacement was also not in a box. I’ll return one and keep on me and just hope that I didn’t pay $$$ for used / refurbished headsets
5,Sound great. Mic is clear to the other party. I work at home doing service calls.. these work so well that I recommend them when I speak to other customer service reps that I have to deal with. When I can barely hear them and tell them so.. they're always having to adjust their mic. With these Jabra headphones.. set it and forget it.
5,I use these nearly every day for online meetings. Very comfortable and great sound quality. Like the puck that has the volume control and mute button. Before I got these I was buying gaming headsets and after about 3 months the mic would quit working. After going through two of those cheap headsets I bought this Jabra and now 18 months it's still working great!
5,I work ten hours a day online with a headset...and I can't stand having heavy double ear headsets.  I love this because is a ONE ear headset.  Sound wasn't compromised and I hear fine.  They hear me with no issues too.  I can use right ear one day and left the next.  My headaches at the end of the shift have stopped and I don't lose hearing at the end of the day like I did before.  They are comfortable and easy to use.
5,Easy to work with and crystal clear sound.
5,This is a replacement of what I used to use in the office. Wearing it is comfortable and not too tight on the head. There is no active noise cancellation. But don’t need that for a home office. Works smoothly with both MS Teams and WebEx.
1,Someone else posted the wire issue and I have the same problem. The design for tension relief is hard plastic...that becomes a failure point. Also how the wires are routed internally. The design should use a soft plastic. Next don't buy if your head is larger the design needs at least an additional centimeter. Overall don't recommend paying the price for a fancy looking headset that had design and reliability issues.
5,Excellent
5,I use these for work and they are exceptional for headphones. The quality for the calls I take daily is great and I don't have to repeat myself. Sou d quality good appearance good volume control great and as far as noise canceling goesnone of my clients have complained about hearing any background noises even when my grandkids are playing so that says something.
5,I was a Doctoral Professor and these were my go-to headsets for online teaching. They are comfortable easy to store and pack and always reliable. My son who started his first professional role said he was using his Airpods and no one could hear him - Hello?!?  So of course I bought him a pair. He said they were the best gift I've sent him... I guess mom to the rescue? These are awesome and affordable. If you are a professional online and want to be heard get yourself a pair. I will never go without...
2,For headphones that run close to $300 the noise cancellation stops working for no apparent reason. I have seen others complain of the same thing. Plus it has barely any bass. But the ear pads are great. I can wear all day with no discomfort.
5,Este producto lo usa mi hijo para tomar clases en línea y se siente muy cómodo al usar éstos audífonos
4,Smart tech been told from the receiving team members the noise cancellation is brilliant used in an airport terminal coffee shop i struggled to hear but my online colleages could hear me perfectly and without the background noise. Comfortable head band i prefer a single ear sound to be conscious of the surroundings cabeling is just about right too.
5,Este es el tercer par que compro para usarlos en la oficina. Quizás no sea el mejor en el mercado pero por el precio cumple su función al 100%.- MICRÓFONO - tiene una buena cancelación de sonido no esperes que te cancele por completo el sonido del señor de los camotes pero si te ayuda a cancelar el sonido regular de tu casa u oficina.- SONIDO - La cancelación de sonido de los audífonos como tal es como un 9/10 porque no es tan bueno como otros que he tenido pero funciona perfecto para llamadas por Skype o Zoom o lo que uses.- COMODIDAD - ningún audífono está hecho para estar las 8 horas de trabajo en tus orejas sin que incomode un poco pero la verdad tiene unas gomas bien cómodas que no apretan y te permite estar con ellos un par de horas.
2,I will be returning these.They are easy to connect to your pc or your smartphone comfortable to wear the incoming sound quality is good and the microphone is also clear but... the microphone picks up everything and does not cut out background noise or voices.I got these to get a better background noise reduction than my MPow set but these Jabra’s do not do the job. While on calls with MS Teams my colleagues advised me that my other set up (mpow) was better at cutting out any background noise than these Jabra’s.
4,I purchased this item based on some pro-reviews (NYT Wirecutter blog). Working from home now I haven't used a lot of headsets so I don't have much to compare to but overall I am happy with the purchase and would recommend for the price. If work is paying for it you may want something a bit more fancy.Pros:The sound is great for what I need - I can hear people clearly and they can hear me clearly blocking out most background noise (my home office is quiet so I don't need noise cancellation)The mic boom swings out of the way so you can eat and drink easily or just listen to music.The mute and volume button is perhaps unnecessary but slightly quicker that using the keyboard/mouse for those functions.Cons:They are comfortable enough though after 3-4 hours of wear you start to feel the pressure on your head. I have an average-sized bonce. Would be nice if the width could adjust.The microphone needs a bit of fiddling to get it the right distance from your lips to avoid a popping/puffing noise when you speak.
5,Son mis audífonos favoritos para trabajar. La calidad del sonido del micrófono es muy buena y no permita casi nada el paso del sonido externo. Le doy como un 10/10 en cancelación de sonido del micrófono y como un 9/10 en cancelación de sonido de los auriculares. Son muy cómodos también. Me parecen excelentes audífonos por su precio.
5,Aucune critique à faire pour le moment - fonctionne très bien - simple d'utilisation. Je l'utilise sur mon téléphone portable mais aussi pour prendre des meetings en visioconférence. Le son est vraiment bon - il n'y a pas d'interférence.J'aime le fait qu'il est une extension pour brancher le casque sur un port USB.
2,Bought this since I work a lot from home and was looking for a wired headset to prevent any issue with batteries.The headset was working perfectly... until sound started to be choppy through one ear (and for sure it happened a few days after the return/exchange period ended).It still usable but it can be disturbing when you're on a conference call to go from stereo to mono sound and it's completely annoying when you listen to music.Was expecting better quality from this brand at this price level...
4,Tengo una bocina jabra y por eso fue que decidí comprar la diadema.  Lamentablemente en cuanto al audio esperaba algo mejor pues en su anuncio indicaba que tienen tecnología de cancelaciónd de ruido.  Yo escucho perfectamente lo que mi interlocutor está diciendo sin embargo los auriculares no aislan el sonido/ruido que tengo alrededor escucho todo.  La calidad del micrófono es buena la gente con la que hablo me escucha bien. Ahí parece ser que si aisla el sonido pues he preguntado a los de la reunión si escuchan el ruido que tengo a mi alredor y la respuesta ha sido que no.Son ligeros ergonómicos los cojincitos de los auriculares no son calurosos.  Traen su bolsita para guardos y que se conserven.  Tienen una útil luz roja que se puede activar cuando uno está ocupado en llamada y así la gente alrededor sabe que estoy en teleconferencia.
4,Los audífonos son sólidos no son frágiles y en general la calidad es bastante buena.  Es correcto lo que comenta uno de los usuarios en este mismo foro que los cables son algo tercos para acomodar y también que el volumen puede ser un poco menor al que uno esperaría.  Sin embargo en relación con el precio creo que la calidad es la que podría uno esperar.  El micrófono con cancelación de sonido es muy bueno (yo estuve utilizándolo para llamadas mientras tengo construcción en mi casa) y la calidad del audio (excepto por el tema comentado del volumen) es muy buena también
1,I bought this product because I work at home and make many calls via a Voip software program on my Mac.  The quality of the calls with this headset is absolute crap. All they hear is echo cutting in and out and it picks up every sound from around the room I am in which is the exact opposite of what I wanted.  More than once I have had to apologize to customers because they cant hear me.
5,-Es muy cómodo lo puedo usar todo el dia y como si nada. Siento el volumen algo bajo en mi dispositivo Samsung JRpro 2018 usando mi app del trabajo comparado con el Mpow HC6 - Auricular USB con micrófono (con este ultimo hasta tengo que bajarle pero con el Java hasta tenia que pegarme el auricular a la oreja en algunas llamadas ya que a veces hablo con gente en la calle y es difícil escuchar claro)El micro a mi gusto queda muy cerca de la cara y aunque en el instructivo se indica como alejarlo solo empujándolo lejos de ti a mi se me regresa poco a poco a una posicion muy cercana a mi cara pero acomodándolo queda chido.No aísla bien el sonido pero si trabajas dando clases en otro idioma o donde sea necesario que escuches tu voz este es una opción.
4,Le prix était un peu élevé mais ce produit est de grande qualité.  Confortable et efficace.  On apprécie sa flexibilité car il peut être connecté avec un connecteur audio régulier ou à travers un adaptateur USB.
5,The headset is fairly comfortable and works well! We use it in a broadcast environment for our director and there's no issue at all! Plug and play.In a loud environment you will want a better headset but the mic picks up very well!
5,Couldn't recommend these highly enough for professional dictation or video calls. A huge step up from the basic headsets which often have issues and break after a few months! A worthwhile investment.
5,Para la atención de usuarios con llamadas y videollamadas este producto esta excelente sin duda una excelente herramienta para el Home Office la calidad del audio es excelente así como la del microfono
3,Para lo que cuesta el producto no es muy bueno por ese precio conviene comprar unos audífonos con micrófono más sencillos hará el mismo trabajo.
4,There's a lot of sound pollution from the headphones to the microphone if your headphones are loud. The mic is sensitive. It works though.The buttons integrate with Zoom but not Google Meet. Haven't tried it on a lot of other things.
5,Excelentes para trabajo de oficina nivel de sonido excelente y puede conectar con celular con el conector 3.5 mm
5,Probably the best headset I ever tried.Very comfortable even for long period of time.I love the long wire and the tabletop control panel with visual status light.Perfect for Zoom WebEx and Teams meetings.
5,Para mi excelente producto relación precio y calidad. Sonido súper nítido. Lo recomiendo ampliamente! Lo puedes usar en tu laptop o celular con un adaptador.
4,Puedo usarlo por varias horas y no molesta el audio y el micro excelente. No tiene cancelación de sonido externo; me parece que vale la pena gastar un poco mas para incluir ésta característica.
5,Me hubiera gustado más cancelación de ruido pero no es su función. No encontré una mejor diadema para conferencias que ésta. El hecho que tenga conector 3.5mm es un plus ya que puedes usar la diadema con el celular incluso. He usado el producto con Windows y Mac y ambos funciona perfecto
5,Great product for Skype calls and other listening activities. I love the controls on the wire and the length is good.Carry case is of good quality too.Not great for noise cancellation - the ear cover is not really designed for that. I knew that going in.
5,Súper cómodo gran calidad de sonido. Somos dos utilizándolos en el mismo ambiente. No cruzamos conversaciones.
1,The microphone stopped working 2 weeks after my amazon support expired.This product didn't even last 2 months working properly. I can only hear people. I cannot talk to them as the microphone stopped working. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! What a waste of money I feel robbed.
5,Excelente para Home Office y escuchar música muy contento con la compra y excelente seguimiento de Amazon
2,not a good product for the Jabra Lineup subpar Quality and not too comfortable had to send one back from work that just stopped working
5,Me gusta que se puede usar como audifonos de música y conectar directo a mi celular. Vale mucho la pena :)
5,Essentiellement c'est du Plug and work....bien construit compatibilité immédiate qualité sonore constante
5,Needed a trusty headset that would work with Office365 and Skype for Business found this unit to work well sound is great and the boom mike swings out of the way......
5,The light feature to let others you are on the phone is good.It is comfortable on the ears and light.
5,Idéal pour le télétravail.  Très confortable et coupe les bruits ambiants.  S'adapte aussi bien à mon ordi qu'à mon cell.
5,Awesome sound quality. Only wished if it was wireless. Used it with webex

4,Excellent product I just wished the wireless version would be cheaper then I would have gone for that one.
5,Son muy cómodos y la opción de utilizar otros audifonos es muy buena. Además de que la calidad del audio es increible.
4,Comfortable to wear. Provides the option to connect to PC or mobile phone which is great.
4,Funciona bien con Skype pero de repente como que algo sucede tal que se escucha un pitido y debo reiniciar la computadora . Le doy 4 solo por eso . Es cómoda y la botonera facilita mucho poner en mute  es como un mando a distancia.
5,Excelente producto el único inconveniente es que no cancela el ruido exterior sin embargo cancela perfectamente para que no se filtre en el micrófono y el audio es excelente.
5,Aísla por completo el ruido de los alrededores y tiene una calidad de sonido excelente.
5,gran comodidad y confort en los oídos  se puede tener por muchas horas sin sentir molestia
5,Finalmente encontre unos audifonos que funcionan correctamente oigo y me escuchan sin problemas

4,Great headphones.
5,Simple and easy to use interface
5,Great
5,Répond à mes attentes. Facilite le travail en télé-conférence.
4,Llevo tres meses de uso.La calidad del audio para llamadas es más que excelente (no para música) y para videojuegos es bastante aceptable...El único tema que tengo es el cable del headset es meramente plástico y se enreda pronto mucho y fácil... Estarlo desenredando es un tema bastante molesto y le resta muchos puntos ya que a veces en media llamada se tuerce y no puedes moverte con tanta libertad.El cable se troza fácil por lo mismo delmparrafo anterior así que si no saber cuidar cables este headset te durará poco menos que nada y habrás gastado dinero mal invertido; si eres muy cuidadoso será una medianamente buena inversión.Su cancelación de ruido no es tan maravillosa como la pintan pero es más que aceptable; además es bastante cómodo de usar que ni sudas y hasta olvidas que lo traes puesto.
5,La réduction du bruit ambiant est correcte et surtout le micro est équipé d'un bon filtre (discussion à coté non perçue dans la visio).
2,This is the 2nd time this has happened with this particular headset and on the same side (1 purchased by my employer and 1 purchased by myself).  When putting it on normally and adjusting as needed (regular-sized head - no unique situation) that particular end snaps quite easily.  I'm not pulling by the earpiece as well - again just adjusting slightly for comfort.  This was just from normal regular use for work meetings during a typical workday. Avoiding in the future.
2,I like Jabra products as a rule and was looking forward to using this headset for work.I don't know if it was the phone I was connecting it to or the headset but clients complained they could hardly hear me. I tested it by leaving a message to my voicemail on another phone and I have to say the quality was horrible.In addition for me the comfort was mediocre. I am not sure I could have worn the headset all day like I presently do with my Poly headset from Plantronics.I returned the headset. But as I stated in the beginning I am not sure whether the fault lay in the headset or my phone and its connection. All I do know is that my Poly headset works with the same connection and phone.
3,Over all product is good but price wise its quite high. Noise cancellation is not too good and not too bad decent but compare with other products in price band quite good.Price is too high not value for money. I buyed this bcos my company was paying for this.Mute and pick call functionality not compatible with slack and google meets only work with zoom and teams.Also jabra packaging is worst for delivery they just send the product with out any proper packaging so packaging wise -1 star looks like they are sending product worth 300 rs not 13k rs. Even 300 rs headphones have better packaging than jabra.Overall if you want noise cancellation decent sound and bass( not very heavy) you can go for the product. But for me product is quite high in price.*******Do check plantronics/poly headphones they are also good comparatively
1,El micrófono NO cancela el ruido exterior. No se dejen engañar por los falsos reviews de internet. -El producto es muy frágil y además el micrófono es tan corto que deslizarlo de arriba hacia abajo cuando se traen puestos es imposible.
4,Es un producto IDEAL para hacer llamadas a traves de MS Teams Zoom o Skype entre otros como auriculares de Oficina (de forma comoda se puede hacer mute con el micro subir/bajar el volumen etc.).Y aunque se puede escuchar musica bastante bien no es el producto recomendado en este caso.
4,Feel well made v good sound quality for price microphone only picks up your voice not background noise work perfectly with PC and have the option of 3mm connector for phone. Loses a star because there is no reduction in the outside noise you can hear at all so not great for a noisy office. As i said nearly excellent.
5,Comfortable and decent one with excellent voice clarity!!
3,Great sound while they lasted however ~2 pairs failed with the ear piece breaking off after 3 years.Raising here as I like Jabra and hope they can do a little better with their material choices.
4,Always used at work and needed one for working from home. Good product.
3,Es cómodo suena bien parece que mi voz se transmite bien PERO el botón para silenciar el micrófono ya no sirve. No duró ni un mes. Sigue siendo funcional pero es menos cómodo tener que estar buscando el icono en la pantalla cuando bien podría usar el botón que ya viene con el set. Después de todo no es tan barato como para andar aguantando "fallitas".Llega en sobre de burbuja en su bolsita de tela sin ningún otra protección pudo haber llegado roto o algo afortunadamente llegó entero.
5,Llevo unas semanas con mi diadema y todo ha funcionado muy bien muy cómodas cuando las tengo puestas (soy de cabeza grande) se escucha muy claro me oyen bastante bien y e control para el volumen el mute y contestar la llamada funciona muy bien.Vienen con un estuche para guardarlos lo cual resulto muy practico para que se mantengan en mejores condiciones la mayoría de las llamadas son por skype y utilizo el puerto USB cuando quiero cambiar al celular solo desconecto la mitad del cable del control y lo conecto a mi celular por el puerto de auricular y listo.
1,I just received the product which was sold as NEW however no box just a ziploc bag with the headset inside which looks like a refurbished product.
5,This is the third pair I purchased for the office one for me and two for coworkers. I mostly use them to listen and transcribe recordings for meeting minutes. They’re very light comfortable and have a good clean sound. If other coworkers need a pair of headphones I will purchase these again. Worth the price.
4,Sound quality is OkMicrophone worked fine and there was no drop in the audio as used to occur with my hanging microphoneThe wire seems to be fairly strong and good qualityThe only issue is that the headset ear caps do not completely sit around the entire ear. Wish they had made it cover the ears completely.But otherwise the product seems good.It would be good if the microphone stick was about 10mm longer so that it could be right in front of the mouthReviewed on 23-2-2021. Product just arrived an hour back !Would be good if they sent it in a firm cardboard box instead of a bubble wrapUpdate 15-Mar-2021 after using for about a month========================================Works good on zoom and google meet and youtube. Noticed that on Zoom it works better if the USB adaptor is used via the round jabra HUB.  But on Google Meet etc it works with just the 3.5mm jack without the USB.The Round Jabra HUB is a bit heavy.
5,Work well with Teams mute pick up call adjust volume with the controller. Looks stylish red light lid up while in a call or meeting. Mic is magnetically attached to the headgear. If you prefer the controller can be detached and the headphone can be plug in with audio plug and the mic will still work maybe not as clear. The controller required USB plug so if there's not enough USB slot with your PC you probably need a USB Hub. All functionality work really well just that volume is very soft had to adjust to near 100 to hear clearly.
2,TLDR: Don't buy even if it's recommended and there's a lot of good ratings.Good quality in terms of sound comfort and general use but very poor in terms of actual build as they tend to break exactly at the same place (see screenshot) in just a matter of months/weeks.The first 3 pairs I've had before were paid by the job but the last one was paid directly by me and it once again broke at the same place.This time the wire managed to stay attached and they're currently being held apart with the holy power of tape and thankfully only the busy light function is not working. Currently awaiting another headset of a different model.What doesn't help at all is that the part where the speaker is isn't fixed and can rotate both ways making it even more fragile!
5,Es garantía de escucha perfecto y te escuchan de maravilla
5,Buen  producto buenos materiales.. Lo he usado al menos 1 ves por semana desde hace más de 1 año. . Buen aislante de sonidos a tu alrededor. Micro te escuchan muy bien. Cable un poco “delicado” hay que tener cuidado si lo jalas por error creo que es una mejor compra la versión Bluetooth  aún que estos en términos generales es un buen producto.
1,Ne recommande pas le produit. Le câble s'entremêle tout le temps et après 4 mois le micro ainsi qu'un des deux écouteurs ne fonctionne plus.
3,Bin enttäuscht (und langsam auch verzweifelt). Die Kopfhörer sind von den inzwischen 9 getesteten Headsets die Besten: Sehr guter Klang exzellentes Tragegefühl. Mit dem oft kritisierten Kabel hatte ich keinerlei Probleme. Aber das Mirkofon ist nicht besser als mein aktuelles 20 Euro Headset. Ich finde die Sprachaufnahme platt (ohne Höhen/Tiefenprofil) und metallisch. Auch meine Gesprächspartner empfanden den Ton als komisch und haben auch bestätigt dass mein aktuelles Headset keinesfalls schlechter ist für manche sogar besser. Dazu kommen diverse Störgeräusche (bei einem Laptop entsteht immer wieder Knattern beim anderen Laptop in einem anderen Raum war ständig ein lautes Brummen in meinen Tonaufnahmen obwohl kein anderes Gerät in der Nähe lief). Ich habe verschiedenste Software Rechner und Räume zum Testen genutzt. Große Enttäuschung war auch dass man es nicht per 35 Klinke an einen Laptop anschließen kann. Das geht nur an Smartphones (geklärt mit Jabra-Support). Hier ist die Produktbeschreibung irreführend. Für Unanspruchslose mag die Qualität reichen aber die erreicht auch ein 20 Euro Headset.
5,Merci
5,Great choice super comfortable good sound & noise cancellation. Like the option of having the jack & the USB port as well!
5,Cómodo
5,Purchased it for office use and found it very helpful.
5,Rien à redire c'est du Jabra la qualité est toujours présente.
5,the best one
4,Funktioniert super. Mikro ist gut. Tonqualität ist ebenfalls gut aber wenn neben einem jemand am sprechen ist wünsche ich mir doch das fehlende Noise Canceling.Ansonsten typisch Jabra… Top Qualität
4,Overall pretty good tool for long conferences that a bluetooth headset's batteries wouldn't last for. But the button you can use to switch the headset from muted/unmuted seems to crap out in the middle of meetings. It could be one of the shit ton of different teleconferencing apps one has to use but I feel like the hardware is at least partially to blame here. And if I bypass the on/off switching piece the cable to the 1/8" jack is a bit too short and restricts my motions when I'm using it.
2,Jabra ist mittlerweile ein bekannter Name vor allem für Callcenter und Sales-Agents. Doch gerade dann und vor allem für den Preis habe ich eine deutlich bessere Sprachqualität des Mikrofons erwartet. Das Mikrofon hat die Qualität von gewöhnlichen 10-Euro-Headphones und die Stimme klingt viel zu "flach". Auch die Soundqualität der Kopfhörer könnte für den Preis deutlich besser sein. Konkurrenzprodukte haben hier viel bessere Tonqualität und Sprachqualität für den halben Preis! Lediglich der Tragekomfort das Design und die Transportabilität des Headsets sind sehr gut. Da für mich die Sprachqualität bei Telefonaten und Videokonferenzen entscheidend ist habe ich das Headset wieder zurückgeschickt.
5,For the price and quality I would recommend these headphones ... still pleased with my purchase ....
5,Overall Satisfied.
1,The product quality is pathetic and return has been requested and no delivery executive has came yet to pick up the product. Worst customer service experience. One ear piece is not working product is a bad a quality. I have requested for return and Amazon has not picked up the product yet.
3,- Mic is directional and is pretty sensitive. Adjust mic boost setting on PC to the very lowest for optimal performance.- Headset earpads are decent. I use it 8 hours a day and my ears hurt. Not too much like some of the other headsets though.- Functions on control pad support Zoom and Skype. I use Zoom and muting myself is pretty easy now.- Overall build quality is decent. A bit on the flimsy side though. Sit on it and lose it.- Headset wire has 3.5mm jack control pad has 3.5mm port and a USB jack. You connect the headset to control pad and then the control pad to the PC's USB port. Mac users beware. Jabra site has options for different jacks for the control pad wire. Amazon might not.- Voice quality is decent on the mic. Blocks out most background noise. But only if set to the lowest boost level. Your voice will still be very audible which is good.Won't give 5 stars to this as nothing is mind-blowing here. It's pretty pricey and us Indians pay an extra 25% over the actual price compared to other countries. So no 4 stars either.3/5 - Does its job more or less.This is a "safe" buy for work use. Get your company to pay for it like I did.
4,Bon produit
5,Very good  best headset for wfh  good noice cancellation sometimes even drilling sound is not heard on the other party but sometimes it works not that much effective . Overall if u want to connect with ur client without any disturbance u can go for it  I have analysed more than a month and choosen this. I never write reviews am doing that bcoz it might helpsome who was confused like me whether to go for this since the amount is huge
3,Le casque est globalement OK mais j'avoue que je m'attendais à mieux. J'ai des amis qui me l'avaient recommandé car ils me disaient que ce casque était très bien si on passe beaucoup de temps en call car il est léger le son est bon et isole du bruit. Pour l'avoir essayé j'ai trouvé qu'il était effectivement plutôt léger le son est passable (pas mieux ni moins bien qu'un autre casque) et je ne trouve pas qu'il isole du bruit. De plus lorsque je parle dans le micro on me dit qu'on ne m'entend pas bien (certainement parce que j'ai une petite voix qui ne porte pas).Bref ce casque conviendra certainement pour quelqu'un qui travaille dans un environnement plutôt calme (essayer de participer à une réunion quand les voisins font des trous dans les murs on oublie) et qui parle fort.
5,J'ai acheté ce casque pour les téléconférences au bureau.J'utilisais jusqu'alors un casque de téléphone portable.Le micro étant trop loin de la bouche - il fallait donc le tenir et le protéger car il captait tous les bruits ambiants.C'était souvent gênant pour mes conversations et mes interlocuteurs me le faisaient savoir.Avec ce casque sur la tête le son est bon et le micro filtre bien les bruits alentours.Réglable confortable sur de longues durées (> 2h) je récupère mes 2 mains pendant mes téléconférences.Facile d'utilisation il se branche sur le port USB et est de suite reconnu par Windows 10.Le casque est manifestement optimisé pour Skype Entreprise.Sous Teams les boutons sur le fil sont un peu moins utilisables et il vaut mieux cliquer dans l'application pour l'activation /désactivation du micro notamment.Un coup de main à prendre...
4,Is actually able to cancel the surrounding noise to a great extent.  Helps a lot for situations where surroundings are noisy
5,I used these for a number of years on client sites and really liked the comfort and sound quality.  While working from home I find I can have them on for meetings most of the day and not notice.  The microphone can be pushed up and meeting attendees do not complain that they cannot hear you.  There is a busy light on the right earphone so that anyone coming into the room can see you are on a call.  You can use USB or 3mm connectors.  When using 3mm you don't get to use the useful muting and volume tool that can be attached.  I have done meetings courses and transcription work using these but they also give a good sound experience when listening to music on your phone.
5,Works Straight out the box very clear sound although volume on machine needs to be very high. Love the product
5,オンライン会議用に購入。写真で見るより意外と小さいです。ゲーム用のヘッドセットと比べるとコンパクトで軽いです。また、たためるのもポイント。当方、GoogleのMeetを利用するが、問題なく使えます。デザインも赤と黒の基調でかっこ良く気に入ってます。
4,Sound quality is great but the build feels pretty cheap for the price.
4,Sono stato tratto in inganno nella descrizione cera scritto tecnologia senza fili e che averei preferito.Il prodotto é molto  buono e la consegna rapida.
5,Queste cuffie sono fantastiche; costano un po' di più delle altre ma ne vale la pena.Il collegamento può avvenire sia tramite jack 3.5 (per collegarlo per esempio al cellulare il jack supporta anche la connessione microfono) sia tramite USB. Per l'USB non si fa antro che inserire il jack in una specie di base (quella che si vede in foto) che ha poi un'uscita USB. Dalla base si può controllare direttamente il volume il mute del microfono la risposta alla chiamata ed è molto comodo in ufficio; in alternativa collegate il jack da 3.5 direttamente nel PC e controllate tutto via Windows.Il design è bellissimo c'è anche un tasto sulla base che fa illuminare un dischetto rosso sia sulla base sia sulle cuffie per segnalare "non disturbare".Sul versante comodità: le cuffie non sono pesanti ma neanche proprio leggere. I padiglioni sono comodi e contribuiscono ad isolare dal rumore esterno ma usarle tutti i giorni per 8 ore di seguito può diventare fastidioso (è solo un'impressione io le uso per meno tempo).Qualità audio: chi vi sente beneficia della cancellazione del rumore del microfono quindi in ambienti affollati è un vantaggio; in ricezione la qualità è ottima per la voce ma solo buona per ascoltare musica (non sono pensate per questo utilizzo)
3,Acquistate per lavoro su consigli di colleghi che le utilizzano da anni si sono rilevate un discreto prodotto per quanto riguarda la qualità dell'audio. Poco pratico il dongle usb. Dopo due anni purtroppo hanno dimostrato una scarsa qualità costruttiva in quanto binario del padiglione sx è uscito dalla sede forzando l'arco e rompendo il rivestimento in plastica dell'arco. Forse andrebbero realizzate in una misura un pò piuù grande per chi ha una testa xl.....
4,a good design with the cable connections being much strurdier than many others. the sound quality is very good. the Mic arm is sturdy and the mic works well. the separate USB controller and standard audio jack make it very versatile. The ony weak point in the design is the part where the earpieces connect to the band. this cleverly rotates for comfort but the actual connector is fairly thin and if it breaks there is no way to fix it. This happened to me but to be fair it had had over a year and a half of heavy use (daily) before ths happened if they ever re-design them I hope they make that part metal
4,GOOD PRODUCT. EASY TO USE. BE ADVISED THE PRODUCT DOES NOT COME BOXED. IT COMES IN A POLY BAG.
3,I have now tried this headset for 2 days and although the concept is good and the feedback on the microphone is good from my friends and colleagues I do feel that the headset is a bit too thin for me.It doesn't really isolate you from the outside and it doesn't really sit properly and surely on your head. I was used to having a proper headset and was looking for a microphone in front of my mouth not to have to hold the microphone constantly but this one is feeling a bit to light for me and I think that I will need something being a bit more solid and isolating me more from the outside.Overall not too bad but I wouldn't buy it again.
5,Telefonkonferenzen ohne Scherzen am Ohr - gute Spech- und Höhrqualität. Einfach in der Benutzung und sehr zuverlässig. Mein Homeoffice Tool Nr 1 neben dem Laptop...
4,Good heaphones for Skype Zoom etc and for editing audio.Gets a bit uncomfortable with extended use but nothing serious.The mic could be a tiny bit better but is perfectly fine for Skype etc.  Not good enough for (say) recording a podcast IMHO.Works out of the box on recent macOS (Catalina 10.15) with Skype Audacity etc.The headset mic should go on the right (though nothing says that)!
5,I am using it for last two and half month. It has best sound quality compare with other brand. Noice cancellation is good. Works well with Microsoft Team.cons: It is expensive as compare to other brand.
5,Brilliant mic noise cancelation and high fidelity sound in the earphones.Cuts out the kids screaming in the room next door when I'm on work calls!
4,Good product great sound quality. Main criticism is that the mic doesn’t have any kind of wind guard so your breathing is often transmitted.
5,Audio formidabile leggerissime non le senti addosso.Veramente un prodotto ottimo
4,J'utilise ce casque pour téléphoner et dicter à mon ordinateur. Le branchement USB fonctionne très bien. le branchement au téléphone aussi. Le son est bon mais je ne l'utilise pas pour écouter de la musique donc je ne peux pas trop juger. La réduction du bruit aussi bien qu'inférieure à celle d'un casque qui couvre les oreilles est bonne. Inconvénient: Lorsqu'on le porte longtemps il fait mal aux oreilles.
5,Je suis super content de ce casque. Il est filaire mais du coup il marche tout le temps avec assez de câble pour ne jamais être embêté. Le système de commandes marche avec Microsoft Teams et Webex et il est vraiment trèss pratique. Le voyant rouge pour ne pas être dérangé est aussi une bonne idée dommage qu'il n'y ait pas la lumière sur les deux oreilles. Mais s'il n'y a pas de réduction de bruit il isole pas trop mal de l'extérieur avec de la musique.Le rangement du micro est sympa dommage qu'il soit contradictoire avec la position de rangement.
5,Consegna veloce puntuale. Ottimo prodotto
4,sound quality and comfort are ok
3,Got it mainly for PC based audio calls with team. The team on other side kept saying they could hear the room noise (fan people talking doors etc). The main purpose of buying this was reviews pointing to mic quality but it din't meet our need so returned.Even tried the option of installing the Jabra software to configure the headphones. The office laptop is locked and doesn't allow installing the Jabra software to configure this headphone so had to install Jabra software on a different laptop and try to configure and reuse on the office laptop. That option also din't work (on both laptops heard ambient noise..).The default mic quality in a microsoft surface pro is of such good quality wonder why is it so expensive to even get basic mic quality.
4,Parfait pour faire mon phoning!Même si je trouve le câble un peu trop rigide.Le son lors des appels est excellent et on m'entend très bien et l'on est bien protéger des sons extérieurs. Je l'ai branché directement à mon smartphone via la prise Jack mais possible de le brancher en USB au PC (jamais utilisé dans cette configuration). Jamais utilisé pour écouter de la musique.
2,Qualità costruttiva "ok" non eccezionale il rapporto qualità/prezzo. Molto leggere sono comode da indossare ma appoggiandosi direttamente all'orecchio (e non attorno ad esso) dopo un'intera giornata possono dare un po' di fastidio. Audio e microfono ottime per call non per altro. Noise cancelling di qualità (è capitato che trapanassero i vicini e in call non si sentisse o che i bambini giocassero nella stanza accanto e si sentisse pochissimo) custodia ampia. Utilissima anche la base per il muto e per il volume che ha il fondo antiscivolo e il fatto che si illuminino quando si è in call (solo dal lato del microfono) permette a chi ti è accanto di sapere che non ti deve disturbare. Il microfono si può spostare sia a destra che a sinistra ("sono double face" ma girandole si invertono canale dx con sx e non c'è nell'applicazione modo di invertire i canali).PURTROPPO via USB a volte perdono il collegamento per qualche secondo succede raramente ma per una decina di secondi si resta senza cuffie. Anche quando sono collegate via jack a volte il microfono smette di funzionare tra l'altro senza dare nessuna segnalazione e l'unico modo di ripristinare è scollegare e ricollegare... poco affidabili.
4,El simil piel de los auriculares no me parecen cómodos en la oreja. Hace que suden y se pegan a ella. Mejor un acabado de espuma para muchas horas de trabajo.
5,Great product. Good price.  Bought to have as a second/back up of exact same. Comfortable for hours of use. USB plug in makes a more robust connection than head phone Jack but equally headphone Jack is available too. One-ear suits me so that I can also hear what’s going on in surroundings.  Jabra is not the cheapest but it is a quality product. The price here was good and delivery was speedy and secure.
5,No issues found. Comfortable for the ears and wearing on the head. Recommended for official calls.
4,Well worth spending a little more the difference and quality is unbelievable
5,Excelente calidad de sonido y muy cómodos de llevar.
4,Good audio and mic quality.Noise cancelation is rubbish.
3,The mic is the most flimsy bit of plastic. Really disappointed as it feels really cheaply made. There's no resistance so the slightest touch makes it go up or down although it does stay where you position it so will be okay as long as you don't knock it.Would be such an easy one to put right but as it is it's just ok and seems quite overpriced (I'd have returned it if it was my money but was a work purchase).
5,Awesome noise cancellation. There was building construction noise loud speaker noise which my colleagues could not hear while I was on official calls! Highly recommended worth the investment.
5,Da ich dieses Headset schon länger kenne habe ich auch für zu Hause eines besorgt. Die Vielseitigkeit und Einsetzbarkeit sowohl am PC Notebook Tablet als auch am Hamdy ist nur empfehlenswert.Großteil der Aussengeräusche werden auch abgeschirmt und so kann man auch ungestört an Webinaren bzw. Telefonkonferenzen teilnehmen.Ich kann mich nur wiederholen und weiter empfehlen!
3,Acheté sur Amazon Warehouse. Bon… le produit présente un défaut : le micro n’est tient pas face au visage il tombe très facilement. J’ai accepté de payer moins cher j’accepte le défaut.
5,Good product. Useful for office calls. Mute/unmute button works well with Microsoft Teams
4,This prodcut works very well only reason this isn't a 5 star is that I find I need to turn the volume on the PC up much higher than with previous headsets I've had. really find the usb controller box useful.
5,Im loving it it fits perfectly well. i can remove the usb and turn it to audio port for my phone. i just realised that yesterday. I was so happy so i dont have to spend another money buying another headset for my phone two in one literally.It also comes with a black purse which it very handy to put in my work laptop bag and preserve it from damage.Overall a very good buy and blocks out every external noise.Perfect.
5,I bought these in the hope of something better than a generic Logitech headset and though twice the price of same these are more than twice as nice. If you  a) like to listen to music some times  b) are apt to wear a headset for a long time for whatever reasonthen these are absolutely worth the money. I bought from LiGo and the delivery was really quick.Overall then 10/10 would recommend.
5,very comfortable been wearing Jabra headphones for several hours a day for work and never uncomfortable or tiring.  The sound quality is great and the microphone certainly has no complaints from the listeners at the other end. Well worth the money
4,Ho ordinato il prodotto sabato pomeriggio ed e arrivato domenica con Amazon prime che si conferma sempre super efficiente grazie anche alla disponibilità e professionalità dei suoi corrieri (La Rosa Giuliano - Roma ).Prodotto ottimo per rapporto qualità prezzo. Ottimo suono e cancellazione del rumore sopratutto per uso professionale durante conferenze in open space. La versione wireless è sicuramente più comoda ma questo è un ottimo compromesso rapportato alla qualità
3,Confortable a remplacé un vieux modèle.Bien avec Teams.J’ai retiré une étoile après quelques mois car à l’usage la fixation de l’oreillette au serre-tête se fait par un petit axe en plastique qui est fragile.En remettant le casque dans son étui j’ai fini par le casser. Aujourd’hui après plusieurs décollages et recollages l’ensemble ne fonctionne plus quitte que une oreille …
4,Ich besitze mehrere kabegebundene als auch bluetooth-Headsets und habe einige Probiert. Das Jabra Evolve 40 Duo USB möchte ich allen empfehlen die für ein überschaubares Budget ein gutes Headset suchen. Absolute Kauf-Empfehlung. Kurz zusammengefasst was mit gut gefällt:+ angenehm auf den Ohren nicht zu warm gutes Material an den Hörern+ Mikro: lässt sich hochklappen filtert sehr gut die Anruferstimme heraus guter Klang beim anderen+ Kompatibiliät: via USB Port anschliessen oder mit dem 35 mm Klinkenstecker. Funktioniert beides wunderbar und Headset kann auch am smartphone genutzt werden.+ Bedienelement zum laut/leise/stumm stellen+ langes Kabel wenn man via USB anschliesst (ca. 15 m)- das rote Kabel ist etwas schwer und sperrig.  Also wen nich das Headset am Tisch habe stört es etwas. Kann aber auch nur subjektiv sein.
4,前は子供のSwitch用に購入した物を借りていたのですが、ちゃんとした物にしようとこちらの製品を購入しました。仕事のweb会議での使い心地ですが、非常に聞き取りやすく素晴らしいです。長時間付けても耳が痛くなりにくく、個人差はあると思いますが、私は3時間付けっぱなしでも大丈夫でした。マイクの精度も良く、PCのレコーダー機能を使って前のヘッドセットやPC備え付けのマイクと比較したところ、ダントツで綺麗に録音できてました。ただし、USB接続ではなく直接PCのイヤホンジャックに繋ぐと、私の場合は少しホワイトノイズが入ってしまうようでした。音楽鑑賞での使い心地ですが、こちらは期待外れな感じです。すぐに慣れたので問題はないのですが、最初は楽器の音など明らかに薄っぺらく感じました。UCとの違いがわからずMSを購入しましたが、teams、zoomの通話が始まると赤く光り、skypeやその他の通話では勝手には光らず、手元のリモコンのボタンを押すと赤く光りました。
5,Sound quality is just awesome headphones are very light weighted.
3,Excellent casque pour le confort et la qualité de fabrication sauf qu'il n'y a absolument aucune isolation des chocs et vibrations induites dans le câble (s'il frotte contre une fermeture éclair ou tout autre objet). C'est très inconfortable et vraiment incompréhensible pour un casque à ce prix et de cette notoriété...
4,Good quality product
4,Ist Top. Allerdings zurückgeschickt weil falsch bestellt (nicht kabellos).
5,Super content pour la facilité d'installation et la qualité du son et du micro. Vraiment nickel. Je commence à sentir un léger inconfort avec les écouteurs sur mes oreilles après 15 20 minutes...
5,Si sente bene durante i meeting su Teams
5,I liked it. I was looking for a headset to work and do many remote meetings. It's pretty decent for that as the microphone works very well so my calls got crystal clear from the other side.Construction is solid from the headset to cables and the usb unit.I just don't recommend it if you're buying to listen to music. It's not that good on that topic. It's cushions do not isolate well external environment. This was not a problem for me and I wasn't looking for those features in this product. I was looking for a headset with a good microphone so I could be better heard during working calls. It works fantastically for this purpose and I'm satisfied.
3,Headset wurde für PC/Smartphone Telefonate in geräuschvollem Büro gekauft diesen Zweck erfüllt es auch ganz gut. Besonders das Mikro ist wirklich hervorragend. Gesprächspartner hören so wirklich fast nichts von der Umgebung. Auch dass man es sowohl über USB am Mac/PC als auch via 3.5" Klinke am Smartphone nutzen kann ist eine wirklich clevere Lösung.Es hat aber auch Schwächen die es nicht unbrauchbar machen aber mindestens nerven:- Passive Geräuschunterdrückung wie es Jabra nennt ist de facto nicht vorhanden Headset sitzt stabil auf den Ohren aber alle Umgebungsgeräusche hört man mindestens genau so laut vorher. Ich hab eher das Gefühl dass die Geräuschkulisse unter dem Kopfhörer unangenehmer ist als ohne. Es klingt ein ganz klein wenig so als würde man sich eine Strandmuschel ans Ohr halten.- Das Kabel ist recht starr und damit öfter im Weg weil es nicht einfach auf dem Tisch liegen mag. Zudem hört man mit Headset jede Berührung am Kabel sehr deutlich z.B. wenn es am Tischrand schleift. Für den Gesprächspartner ist das aber nicht hörbar.- Nach max. 1h drückt es mir persönlich recht stark auf den Ohren und ich muss es abnehmen bin aber vom Tragekomfort aber durch meine Beoplay H6 sehr verwöhnt.- Musik klingt ok aber doch etwas flach und Höhen fehlen ist halt auf Sprache optimiert.Mittelgutes Headset mit hervorragendem Mikro mässigem Tragekomfort und einem unnötig starren Kabel für 80 EUR war ich nicht ganz überzeugt.
4,Le pod usb ne fonctionne pas bien avec teams. En jack c’est parfait
4,世の流れに一週遅れでzoomなるものを使ってみようと購入しました。１．音質は人声の再生を重視していて、高域・低域の再生は割り切っています。聴きやすい音質。２．ステレオと書いてありますが、ヘッドフォンユニットの右・左チャンネル表示がありません。自験ではコードとマイクアームが付いているユニットがR、何も付いていないユニットがL でした。３．ヘッドフォンの端子は４極ですが、パソコン(ThinkPad)のイアフォン端子から再生可能です。iPhoneとの接続は「Lightning-3.5mm ヘッドフォンジャックアダプタ」を噛ませることで再生可能です。４．パソコンとのUSB接続には附属のコントローラー(直径5cm位の円形) を使いますが、取説が簡単すぎて困ります。マイクミュート、ヘッドフォン音量の増減までは判りますが、コントローラー中央の「Jabra」ボタンを押すとオンになる「ビジーライト」の機能が書いてありません。５．重量は軽く、長時間使っても疲労は少ないと思います。本社デンマーク、製造はCHINAですが使えそうです。
3,Doesn't feel like a £60 headset. Light flimsy plastic. Also wasn't USB-A.
1,Third time in a row I have received a defected product. Amazon should check if the seller is authentic and provides correct products to the buyer.
4,Good and comfortable to use the mic seems  too brittle and though can be used for connecting to phone the sound quality is decent but not outstanding. A bit overpriced for the overall value of the product.
4,Ich bin sehr überzeugt von diesem Headset!Die Qualität ist astrein das tragegefühl super und die Ausstattung ist gut!Endlich können wir völlig entspannt zu dritt im Büro telefonieren. Ohne Headset und auch mit anderen die wir vorher ausprobiert haben war da nicht dran zu denken!Das 40er kann genau das Selbe wie das 65er ist allerdings Kabelgebunden. Den Mehrpreis zum 65er empfinde ich als lohnende Investition da das das Headset sich gleichzeitig mit Handy und Laptop verbindet und automatisch den richtigen Kanal wählt ohne umstöpseln zu müssen!Klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,Super tolle Kopfhörer. Sehr gute Klangqualität. Würde ich wieder kaufen.
5,Got these early on in the whole COVID thing and they have been great. Comfortable for extended use and sound quality is really good for voice calls on teams webex etc. I would highly recommend them and have done to a number of colleagues who purchased a pair and are also very happy with them.
1,bonjouracheté le 28 novembre 2018 le 7 décembre 2019 l'embase d'écouteur coté micro casse (l'écouteur n'est plus retenu que par le fil audio) donc dans quelques jours le fil sera coupé...prix d'achat 70 euros environ ... quel honte ... je ne peux mettre de cote négative donc une étoile mais comme le casque n'a jamais été maltraité je pense que le nouveau prix (48 euros) montre ce que vaut ce casque en réalité.Professionnel je suis TRES étonné que Jabra fournisse du matériel de cette non qualité ...mon fils (gamer intensif) utilise un hyper X : https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00SAYCVTQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1achat 11 dec 2019il n'arrête pas de démonter le micro pour n'utiliser que le casque ... sur son honor 8 ... je vois que ca se passe plutot bien .. aucune critique et matériel nickelpar contre le casque est un peu plus enveloppant ...mais si on a pas besoin d'entendre le contexte ambiant .. le choix et vite fait .. .j'utilise aussi jabra dans mon boulot c'est beau c'est classe mais c'est fait pour ces dames .. (attentives et délicates)dommage : 10 jours après la période de garantie ... c'est épatant .... merci Jabra
5,Noise cancellation works very well. I have 3 dogs at home and nobody on call recognise my dog barking at all. Highly recommended product.
5,This is mainly for the office calls not intended for music. Still music can be enjoyed of you  are not particular about bass. Best for calls.
5,Écouteur de très bonne qualité léger et très performant pour l’écoute et le micro
5,If you are doing home office. Perfect headphones. perfectly suitable for Teams and Skype even in VDI it works awesome
5,Great headsets good for noise cancellation and the audio quality is good too.I have tried both the single ear muffs and double ear muffs and for the sake of paying a bit extra I would certainly recommend the double ear muffs.
5,Très léger. Très bon son.Rien à redire. Qualité et prix ce casque a tout pour plaire.
5,I am a heavy VoIP user with over 200 calls a day. This headset is the only one handling my needs
3,As a product it looks to be very well made & call quality seemed good - from the limited time I used it.However I had to send back because they were far too tight on my ears and pressed on my glasses; after only 10 minutes I began to get a headache.Such a shame as otherwise they would have been perfect.
4,L'ancien a fait deux ans le fil a fini par présenter des faiblesses rendant les communications difficiles. Idéal si vous ne le déplacez pas trop. Espérons que celui-ci fasse mieux. Son  très correcte pour la téléphonie et écouter un peu de musique depuis l'ordinateur. Le système USB est utile surtout si vous téléphonez depuis l'ordi. J'aurais préféré un double jack à la fois téléphone portable + ordi.
5,Excellent sound quality and integrated well with Skype for Business. Works with Teams too.Cons are I find the head band a bit tight on my ears meaning long meetings require me to take them off and readjust for comfort. This is a minor con but worth knowing if you have a larger hat size.
1,I've given this headset one star for one reason: the plug on the headset that plugs into the USB unit is what looks like a normal 3.5mm 4-pole plug. It looks normal enough until you notice that part of it is flat on 2 sides. It will still plug into most other devices like a phone etc but if it breaks you will never be able to plug any other headset into the USB unit or replace the cable as these plugs are not available. There is no reason whatsoever for Jabra to have designed the plug like this other than to stop you replacing the cable or using any other headset with the USB unit. In other words they want you to throw away and replace the entire package even if just the headset part breaks.Any company that goes out of their way to alter a standard design with a feature that does nothing except lock you in to proprietary parts does not deserve your money. Anti-consumer practices like this mean that I will never buy another Jabra product.Edit: After 8 months the USB dongle has stopped working. Since I only use the dongle/headset once a week for work meetings over Skype this is a pretty poor show. The headset itself is still going and I'm using that with a 4-pole 3.5mm to 2 x 3-pole 3.5mm lead.
5,Should have upgraded a long time ago. Makes my working day so much better. Esp with COVID now spending so much time in virtual meetings a quality headset makes me feel much less frazzled at the end of the day
5,Good quality and work perfectly. They do what they are supposed to.
5,Life saver at work especially with the do not disturb mode. The sound is clear and people have commented on how clear the microphone is. Great to be able to diall in from my laptop direct and not need to enter codes. Would recommend and would love to try the wireless version soon.
5,The headset and connecting control device came neatly packed in a zipped couch making it useful to bundle everything up clean and free from the dust. Easy to use from the get-go. Headphone jack works perfectly with the smartphone. The padding for the ears was comfortable. You could go on for hours wearing the headset. Sound quality was good and balance especially making calls/conference call meeting. Great product all round.
2,I have had 4 of these headsets and 1 of the much more expensive over ears one. The sound quality is good and the microphone is good. However the bag that comes with them is incredibly annoying as it's just too small resulting a a lot of fiddling to get the headphones and lead in usually in a rush at the end of a meeting. This in turn puts a lot of strain on the headphone and as a result ALL the ones I have bought have broken usually where the speaker joins the headband (one was the boom) and Jabra are definitely not helpful in replacing them with basically a "get lost". Not buying anymore and the next order of ten for my tech team went to Platonic.
5,Habe das Headset auf der Arbeit und habe es mir privat auch zugelegt.Man bekommt mit was um einen herum passiert und kann gleichzeitig in guter Qualität an einer Videokonferenz teilnehmen.
5,Use el producto para radioTv y genial el sonido muy comoda sus almohadillasSonido envolvente...Repetiré con el mismo producto inalámbrico!!Buen precio servicio 😃Me lo aconsejo un entendido en la materia y es espectacular
2,Didnt work so returned. Felt good and comfortable though.
5,I have not tried the USB connector yet but the 3.5mm connector works great for my Mac. It is very comfortable to wear for long VoIP calls. The sound quality is superb for both calls and music. The included carry bag makes it very easy to be carried in a computer/travel bag. The ear pieces turn 90 degree so it can be packed flat in the bag. Overall a very good headset. The only thing if I could choose is not to have the bright orange cable! It does not fit in with the rest of my devices on the desk!
3,Poor sound quality. Used it to make calls when in lockdown - could barely hear and understand the callers on the other end.
5,Headset funktioniert eineandfrei und zuverlässig. Hoher Tragekomfort es drückt nicht und rutscht auch nicht vom Kopf. Gute Verarbeitung.
5,Compared to many other headsets that i had purchased this is good. It does not have great noise cancellation but it is better than others. Good for voip calls.
5,Die Tonqualität ist super.Ich verwende das Headset beruflich vor allem für Skype.Es erfüllt voll und ganz die Erwartungen.Auch das telefonieren mit dem Headset an einem Klinkenanschluss am Telefon funktioniert einwandfrei.
4,会社で使うので片耳にしましたが、スピーカー部はもう少し大きく耳を包んでくれてもいいかなと思いました。ふかふかして肌触りはいいです。
5,Nice product. Has decent noise cancellation
2,Faintly audible to the other person. No noise cancellation works
5,Non per niente sono professionali direi che come rapporto qualità prezzo non hanno rivali. Se state tutto il giorno al telefono o in webex sono ideali
5,Conforme à la description et aux photos.
5,Das Headset ist super und ich benutze es sehr gerne. Guter Sound und auch das Mikrofon ist sehr gut.
5,I use this pretty much every day for work on video conferences.  It is great just plug in and play on my Windows 10 PC.  The quality is excellent and the in cable controls are really handy.  Great bit of kit.
5,Exactly what I was looking for. I need to be hands-free to take calls and use the PC on regular basis. I use these mainly on my mobile phone but have also used them on the PC and they're fantastic. I'm told by callers that the call quality is also great on the other end too. Also a bonus that they come with a case and pack down really nicely and the mic clips into the head band meaning they can be used as regular headphones.
5,I own a range of headphones including A&H XONE DJ cans and Sennheiser HD650s. Both of these are perfectly adapted to their desired use as in-fact so is the Jabra Evolves too. I use the Jabra for telecons both when on my iPhone and also when using one of the meeting apps like Slack Zoom or Skype. The cord is long and appears to be overbraided with something indestructible. They are light to wear sound very clear and even fold up into a tiny zippered carry case you can stuff in your laptop case. Perfect.
5,I have been using them for nearly a year now literally every day for 4-8 hours.I would def. buy them again!
5,The Best headset for online discussion very light no feedback brilliant little headset. volume control USB and a small jack so you can use it in your phone they are really great for using on the phone.
2,This expensive product lasted less than 4 months before becoming faulty - unable to recommend. Regret buying.
5,Perfect for work from home
5,Headset arbeitet zuverlässig Bedienung ist auf einem guten Niveau und einfach ohne Schnickschnack
4,BonjourEtant un inconditionnel de la qualité des produits Jabra... je ne m'attendais pas à être déçu ! Je ne le suis pas !Le système de jack 2.5 + base USB rend ce casque super-polyvalent.. le filtrage son du micro est excellent.. la bascule du micro avant-arrière est 1 + pour changer d'oreille ;) La housse fournit est de très bonne facture..Rien à dire parfait !!
5,These are great headphones and have transformed my video calls. Very comfortable to wear and were easy to set up.
5,Super génial. Ce casque isole bien et apporte un confort pour les appels et l’écoute de la musique.
5,Super zufrieden. Damit si d meine Teamsitzungen so viel besser.
5,Bon produit commandé à titre personnel pour offrir (j'ai le même à titre professionnel et il est top).Livraison rapide
5,its ok
5,These headphones are perfect for all day work use. More importantly Jabra's customer service is incredible. My dog ate my headphones... really... and since the headphones were still under warranty Jabra replaced them with a brand new pair no questions asked. Within a week of sending them back (they made getting a shipping label super easy too) I had a brand new pair mailed to me at zero cost. Incredible! Thanks Jabra!
5,Très satisfait
5,Habe ein Headset für's Büro gesucht und bin mit dem Jabra Evolve fündig geworden. Sitzt gut schirmt Außengeräusche zuverlässig ab hat einen guten originalgetreuen Sound (kein blecherner Telefonbandpass-Sound) und das Mikro taugt auch. Beim Gegenüber hört sich die eigene Stimme natürlich und laut an.Das etwas steife Kabel ist gewöhnungsbedürftig. Wirkt zwar super robust und sieht mit seinem Neon-Orange toll aus. Aber stößt man daran hört man das als dumpfes Geräusch im Kopfhörer das kann etwas stören. Das wäre aber auch der einzige Verbesserungsbedarf an diesem Headset.
5,Rien à dire. Bon son et surtout confortable. Pour le prix c’est un excellent achat
5,Does the job easy to set up and use. We are now using these across the organisation.
4,Worth the price easy to use comfortable and clear sound
4,Utilisation professionnelle.Le son semble de bonne qualité bonne réduction des bruits alentours.Le casque est léger il est donc plutôt agréable à porter.
3,Ich habe solch ein Headset von meiner Firma. Das funktioniert prima. Deshalb habe ich mir auch privat eins bestellt. Bei diesem war die Qualität des Mikros schlecht. Der Ton wurde in Skype-Calls immer wieder leise.
1,Nach knapp einem Jahr in Benutzung ist die winzige Befestigung des Bügels auf der Lautsprecherseite gebrochen und der Schaumstoff am Bügel ohne Lautsprecher löst sich. Erbärmliche Hardware Qualität bei dem Preis.Nie wieder.
5,Was man im Homeoffice braucht um Stundenlang Meetings zu halten  angenehmer Sitz kein Druck auf den Ohren hervorragende Tonqualität und Bedienung.
4,Mon fils est très content de son cadeau .
4,片耳タイプにしましたが、イヤパッドが無い方のT字型の金具はゴムで覆われていて長時間付けていても全く快適です。イヤパッド側は4時間くらい連続で付けていると、やっぱり少し痛くなります。オンイヤータイプの宿命でしょう。音質はハッキリ明瞭、マイク感度も問題なし。問題は価格ですね。個人が在宅勤務TV会議で使うには高めです。信頼性は不明ですが、Jabraの小型円形マイクスピーカーを職場で何年も使っていますが耐久性と信頼性はありますので、このヘッドホンも信頼できると想像(期待)しています。
5,Tolles Produkt!!!!
3,Ich bestreite reglmäßig recht lange Telefonkonferenzen und bin dafür auf der Suche nach einem Headset.Mittlerweile bin ich auch echt bereit recht viel Geld dafür auszugeben aber für diesen Preis muss ein Headset auch schon etwas bieten.Das Headset an sich ist wirklich gut und auch solide verarbeitet. Wenn da nicht diese eine Sache wäre: Das Kabel ist dermaßen starr dass es bei jeder Bewegung meines Kopfes Störgeräusche verursacht. Das nervt total und lenkt mich von der Telefonkonferenz ab. Manchmal frage ich mich ob die Ingenieure die so etwas entwickeln ihr Produkt eigentlich auch jemals selbst verwendet haben....Ich werde das Headset daher vermutlich zurückschicken...
5,n/a
5,The headphone is really to good for office use. I have been using the headphone for office n entertainment purpose. Worth the money
5,Le produit fonctionne parfaitement aussi bien en connexion USB qu'en prise jack.Le petit boitier de commande permettant de couper le micro de monter/diminuer le son est très utile.Le son est excellent et le microphone fonctionne aussi très bien.Parfait !
5,Ich finde es sehr praktisch. Ich verstehe nicht warum sich die Leute so sehr darüber beschweren. Absolut zu empfehlen.
5,Alles kam sehr schnell an gut verpackt genau nach meinen Wünschendanke weiter so
5,Exactly what my I needed after my wife who is also working from home decided she wanted to use the poriginal headset.
1,lead too fragile. completely useless sound now and have to move the lead around. cuts out all the time.
3,Had a for over 6 months.  the sound quality is good and very comfortable to wear - I use it for 2 to 3 hours of calls a day comfortably.The issue is the robustness of the headset both extendable arms are now broken and I need a new headset.Overall: Perfect for the desk based users. Not good for those who are travelling types where everything needs to be a bit more robust...
5,GUT
5,Super KLang prima Qualität - genau so wie wir es uns gewünscht hatten!
5,テレワークでスピーカーマイクを使っていましたが、ノイズが入るとのことで、ヘッドセットに移行。音質の観点から、USB接続であることは必須条件だったのですが、Logicoolと悩んだ結果、jabraを選択。値段は一般的なヘッドセットに比べると高いですが、通話品質と使いやすさは間違いないです。専用のポーチも付いていて、たまに出社する時でもコンパクトに持ち運び可能。付け心地も快適です。これは却ってお買い得かもしれません。Windows、Macの両方に対応。おすすめできます。
5,Produit parfait. Pas trop gros facile à installer et excellent son
5,Very usefull for skype meeting or videocallGood Noise réductionClear voice
5,quite amazing indeed. i use Plantrocis at work but when out I use this on my phone and mac.sound is great can be worn for long periods and remains comfortable.removes most background noise but not all.looks great not sure if I feel like a DJ / Pilot.Love the way the mike locks into the headband by magnet when not required.
3,Tonqualität und Sitz perfekt. Leider ist am Gehäuse ein Teil nicht bündig / kraftschlüssig montiert so dass der Kopfhörer links bei bestimmten Frequenzen der Sprache störend „scheppert“.
5,Bought these for my girlfriend and after trying them myself for a couple of Skype and Hangouts calls at work I decided I needed a pair myself. Very comfortable very clear sound plus they block the noise around you and the mic is excellent it does not pic up any background noise.
5,Sono cuffie molto comode e l’audio è buono. Il microfono è ottimo
4,かなり良い。安心のjabra片耳をはじめて使ったが、コールセンターなど以外ではあえて片耳にする必要は無いことが分かった。。
5,Good noise cancelling comfortable and easy to set up (plug in and go)
5,Perfect for use with computer or mobile phone. Good quality product
5,Alles bestens. Die Tochter ist sehr zufrieden damit.
5,good headset. came in a plastic bag as assuming it was from a 3rd party rather than Jabra but worked fine
2,These function fine for a short period of time  however for more than an hour I find them really uncomfortable. They put a lot of pressure in my jaw. I’ve now stopped using them.
3,Audio connection to the USB connector is poor or defective it doesn't seat well and causes constant static.  Returned this item.
5,Parfait pour le télétravail
5,Excellent for use with skype and my mobile phone. It does work with Linux but the driver is probably worst that the windows / OS X version. I have had it now for a couple of months and I use it for over 4 hours every day.
5,Alles super gerne wieder
5,Excellent for work from amidst so much of noise from around. Worth the money
4,Great work really well and are light and comfortable. Ideal for home office use. Docked a star just because the microphone boom feels a little flimsy
5,produit conforme à mes attentes
1,Acheté en remplacement d'un casque professionnel identique qui m'a été subtilisé après 2 ans d'utilisation intensive et satisfaisante.Celui-ci commandé sur Amazon a commencé à partir en morceau au bout de 2 mois dans les mêmes conditions d'utilisation et le module de contrôle USB bug de temps en temps nécessitant une déconnection/reconnexion USB.Celui reçu est donc très certainement une contrefaçon ayant du mal à croire à un exemplaire d'aussi mauvaise qualité pour un casque JABRA de cette gamme.
5,Nice one. Good sound. Noise cancellation.Overall good.
5,Sehr gute Ware.
2,Très bon casque en terme de confort de légèreté et de son.Malheureusement la fonction décrocher/raccrocher ne fonctionne pas dans Teams.C'est justement pour cette fonction que j'avais acheté ce casque.Jabra et Microsoft se renvoie la balle depuis plus d'1 an.Lamentable.
5,Quality is almost too good - the mic pics up everything. Drop a pin in the room and the other party will hear it.Thank goodness the USB connector has a handy mute button. I've had to press that if I need to break win...errr...cough on a call.
5,Super bequemer Tragekomfort. Ich nutze das komfortable Headset quasi täglich und bin von der Qualität aber eben auch von dem preis-leistungsverhältnis mehr als begeistert. Die Klangqualität ist natürlich und gut. Es sitzt angenehm und ich möchte es nicht mehr missen 😊🍀⚓️
5,Ich bin super zufrieden!
5,Gute Qualität und angenehm zu tragen
5,Casque parfait pour de la téléphonielivré avec un connecteur USB qui me permet de switcher entre mon téléphone (jack 35)  et mon mac (il faut déconnecter l'un pour aller sur l'autre)livrée avec une house de transportl'emballage un peu limite car livrer dans une poche en plastique (puis dans le carton Amazon)
5,Auriculares de muy buena calidad valen la pena
5,ottime cuffie per qualità e prezzo
5,Perfect for office use as it allows you to focus on the meeting but not block out the world. Great sound and easy set up for USB or headphone
5,Excellent quality headset and audio.  Very comfortable to wear although I do not wear this all day max is around 2 hours.  Also bought a RJ9 to 3.5mm jack lead and can plug in to use with my work Cisco phone. Recommended.
5,I use these for work. They work well with Skype for Business and for Webex sessions. I like the mute and busy buttons on the controller. Noise cancellation (for the microphone) works well when in noisy environments.
5,J'utilise ce casque exclusivement pour des appels et meeting téléphonique long en open space. Il est très agréable à porter d'une bonne qualité auditive et un micro efficace au dire des personnes que j'ai en contact. Je le branche sur un iPhone 8 plus et cela améliore nettement la qualité des communications.
5,Gute Verarbeitung verwende ich vorwiegend für Skype telefonie und als Lautsprecher. Durch usb und Klinke flexible auch am Handy einsetzbar.
2,Good mic quality. Build quality is average. The headphone came apart in 6 months.  Looking forward to a replacement.
3,評価が良くて見た目も使いやすそうだったので購入しましたが、片耳なのでバランスが悪くてかけづらい！！コードレスではないのは分かってましたがコードが太めで長いのが煩わしい。結局イヤホンタイプか両耳タイプのほうが良かったみたいです。
5,good
5,音がクリアです。
5,Ottime cuffie da videoconferenza buon isolamento del microfono da rumori. Perfetta per uso home office con figli che girano per casa. Comode anche con uso prolungato forse per uso tipo call Center sceglierei un modello senza fili.
5,Consegna rapida buon prodotto.
5,Funciona muy bien y es comodo
5,the quality is great.
5,Just set it up which was a breeze. Voice quality over Skype is simply awesome!! There’s a massive difference between my Plantronics one and this. This aounds very crisp and clear.
4,really good headset
5,コロナの状況で大変役に立っています
5,Ich bin rundum zufrieden und kann dieses Modell ohne Einschränkungen weiterempfehlen.
1,The spectrum analysis of the recorded sound from the mic of Jabra Evolve 40 UC showed that frequencies above 8 kHz are rejected by the mic. This is not acceptable. Sound frequencies above 8 kHz give very good clarity of speech and that is exactly not captured by the mic. I believe that this may be defective. So I have returned the item. Thanks to Amazon for arranging the refund.
5,Ottime cuffie. Buon audio alti e bassi comode e leggere. Molto maneggevoli. Nessun problema di installazione. Le consiglio
5,Quality one.
5,Excellent produit clarté du son tant en enregistrement qu'en écoute.le produit est très bien fini.Jabra est toujours fidèle à lui-même.La possibilité de passer en jack est très appréciable ainsi le casque peut fonctionner en jack comme en USB.
5,ist super :)
5,Very pleased with the quality of this headset and speedy delivery
1,J'ai acheté qq casques de ce modèle en 2019.j'avais le précédent. 2 d'entre eux se sont cassés assez rapidement fil pas solide. Un collaborateur estime qu'ils glissent également un peu sur les oreilles. J'ai eu le plus grand mal a les faire remplacer par jabra qui m'indiquait que les modèles avaient été achetés par le revendeur américain en 2017 et qu'ils n'étaient plus sous garantie !!! Bref l'échange sera fait au final mais ca a été compliqué. Le produit n'est pas solide au final pour un usage professionnel par rapport au modèle précédent puisque 2 casques sur 6 ou 7 se sont cassés après qq semaines.
1,Leider ist ein sehr starker chemischer Geruch am Headset (Ohrmuschel Polsterung). Selbst nach zwei Tagen intensiver Lüftung ist dieser leider noch immer wahrnehmbar und verursacht bei mir Kopfschmerzen. Bisher war ich eigentlich immer sehr zufrieden mit den Produkten von Jabra aber offensichtlich hat sich hier was geändert - sehr schade.
1,Zero noise cancellation...Waste of money.. High priced
5,I have been using for couple of months now  the product is excellent. the noise cancellation mic is great.
5,Nach zahlreichen Versuchen mit anderen Geräten haben wir ca. 30 dieser Headsets im Einsatz. Keine Probleme super Sprachqualität einfach und unkompliziert im Handling.
5,Perfct
5,Perfektes Produkt das Headset bietet einen guten Sound und perfekte Mikro Aufnahmequalität. Unterdrückt Umgebungsgeräusche perfekt.Die Kabel sind sinnvoll und Leicht trennbar.schnelle Lieferung! Gerne wieder.
5,Sounds good voice clear nice and comfortable
1,Le produit est bien mais je n'arrive pas à obtenir de facture en bonne et due forme (avec TVA et numéro de TVA intracommunautaire) pour ce produit. Bien entendu je suis prêt à revoir ma note et mon commentaire en cas de réception de cette facture.Merci
5,Comfortable great sound quality and I can use on my Samsung tablet and phone too
5,Tutto ok!
1,Does not fit properly in your head
1,Sebbene sia un prodotto non proprio economico la qualità del microfono ha sempre lasciato a desiderare fin dal primo giorno di utilizzo con rumori metallici di sottofondo notevoli. Tale problema si è gradualmente accentuato portandomi ad avere a 6 mesi dall'acquisto un microfono inutilizzabile. Provato a contattare l'assistenza clienti Jabra per avere la sostituzione del prodotto ma dopo 40 minuti di attesa ho desistito e mi sono rivolto all'ottima assistenza Amazon che ha provveduto al rimborso.
2,Achtung! Für die Telefonie mit Fritz!Fon C5 nicht geeignet. Der angerufene Teilnehmer empfängt starke Störgeräusche.
1,Le avevo comprate perché al lavoro tre anni fa mi avevano dato delle Jabra simili ed erano eccellenti.Queste invece fanno letteralmente pena come audio. Un auricolare da 5 euro suona meglio. Restituite dopo un minuto.
2,Die Verarbeitungsqualität ist nicht besonders. Nach nur ein paar Jahren löst sich nun das Kunstleder von der Ohrauflage.
1,Here is my detailed review please read.1) Sound quality is good but bit low would be challenging to hear other parties in noisy place.2) Build quality looks good but in 4 weeks left year piece came out of band housing. Hadn't expected this from Jabra.3) It works well with Skype but controlled is quite bulky and provided doesn't break.4) A pouch which is secondary is made of good quality.5) Middle red colour line is made by cheap paint which comes off in 3-4 uses.
2,L'embase d'écouteur coté micro casse (l'écouteur n'est plus retenu que par le fil audio... c'est déjà mon deuxième casque et même problème survient! Maintenant c'est bon je passe dans une autre marque!
1,One side light is not working... This ia the 2nd time i am facing this issue
5,Great product really clear audio directional mic is excellent at cutting out unwanted background noise.
5,Habe mal wieder "Oversized" gekauft da ich den mitgelieferten USB-Adapter auf 35mm-Klinke eigentlich nicht brauche. Das Headset funktioniert am Fritz!Fon C5 sehr gut!
5,Très confortable et performant. La réduction du bruit est très appréciable. Utilisé par 5 personnes dans le service qui passent en moyenne 3 heures par jour au téléphone.
5,Son muy cómodos
5,Cuffie eccellenti suono ottimo avvolgono bene le orecchie (si fa fatica a sentire fuori) e microfono perfetto (non ho ricevuto alcuna lamentela dall'altra parte).In più l'astuccio è molto comodo per portarle on giro.Ottimo acquisto lo consiglio.
5,Ottimo strumento di lavoro.
5,Great headset
5,Wire quality is bad .noise cancellation is BEST..EAR CUSHIONS ARE HARD
1,Keeps ringing post connection and magnetic noises
1,Starker Geruch der Schaumstoffe in Ohrpolstern Ware ging ungebraucht zurück
5,Excellent casque. Le son est de très bonne qualité. Il est confortable et plutôt léger. Le bouton de réglage volume/muet/appel et très utile. Je recommande.
5,Nice built eazy on your ears plug & play.
2,Das Produkt sieht optisch gut ausallerdings hat es nach relativ kurzer Nutzung einen Bruch innerhalb des Bügels gegebenjetzt ist das Ding am ...Für den Preis erwartet jemand schon eine deutlich bessere Verarbeitung.ÜBEL !!!
5,Ottime sia nell'ascolto audio che durante le chiamate.Sono comode anche con un uso prolungato; pur portando occhiali da vista non danno fastidio.Comoda la base di connessione che permette di regolare il volume e mettere in mute il microfono.
1,Mic did not work
1,Habe dieses Headset aufgrund der Bewertungen für unsere Sales Agents gekauft leider halten diese nicht lange aus bereits 3 Headsets sind gebrochen/ Kaputt und das in weniger als einem Jahr bei normalem Gebrauch!Leider ist durch Amazon auch nicht klar wer hier für den Schaden aufkommt da dies eigentlich noch unter Garantie läuft. Ich bitte den Verkäufer sich an ich direkt zu wenden.Vielen Dank
5,overall an excellent product
2,Haptik und Optik sind top. Störend bei der Arbeit ist das sperrige Kabel das ständig im Weg ist und durch Reiben am Körper auch noch Störgeräusche verursacht. Satz mit x ... war wohl nix.
1,Le casque est arrivé en état de dysfonctionnement. L'écouteur droit ne fonctionne pas. C'est manifestement un problème de connecteur. Et avec l'épidémie de coronavirus ne je vais pas m'amuser à le renvoyer. Pour un casque à 84 euros dont j'avais un réel besoin pour le travail ça fait mal... Un ami informaticien m'avait pourtant vanté la marque Jabra.
5,Fantastic headset. Worth the money. Use it daily. No issues. Easy to use Recommended product.
5,Soddisfatto dal acquisto; mi trovo molto bene per cui massima valutazione
1,Pas satisfait fait du bruit quand on fait pivoter le microphone. Renoi Amazon impeccable comme toujours.
3,Como comentaba otro usuario para música horroroso. No sirven y para Voz aparte de tener problemas de compatibilidad no me convencía del todo. Lo he cambiado por un Plantronics C720 . Funciona genial con música y tiene Bluetooth.
5,Ich benutze den jetzt seit einiger zeit im Homeoffice und bin sehr zufrieden. Sitzt gut drückt nicht und sehr gute Audioqualität.
5,Very handy and high quality
2,Au bout de 2 ans les arceaux interne se sont détachés et la protection en simili cuir est décollé.Bon produit pour rester en permanence sur un bureau. Pour les déplacements à éviter.
5,Tres bonne qualite audio et micro
5,Excellent product
5,Es muy cómodo tiene un sonido muy bueno en los cascos y el micrófono debe estar bien  ya que terceras personas así me lo han expresado.
2,Attention contrairement au descriptif fait ce casque est équipé d'une terminaison USB et NON PAS jack. Ce qui ne permet pas de le connecter à un smartphone par exemple.
1,Bonjour après quelques semaines d'utilisation voici qu'un des écouteurs se met à griser le son.C'est extrêmement dérangeant surtout en période de télétravail.
1,El micrófono funciona bastante bien y el sonido no está mal pero estos auriculares duran exactamente un año…He comprado dos y ha pasado lo mismo: al cabo de un año se despega la almohadilla del auricular como puede verse en las fotos.Después de la segunda vez cambio de marca. Para el precio que tienen podían hacerlos un poco más resistentes la verdad.
5,promptly delivered. Works well.
5,Excellent headset
1,Noise cancelling is very bad .... useless
5,Excellent quality!
1,You can hear perfectly clear with this but the sound quality from the other end is dreadful. I returned and got a full refund
1,Prima comprato versione Bluetooth (connessione instabile dopo 2 settimane di uso) e dopo la versione con cavo sperando che è un po' più durevole.... Pero di qualche settimana il microfono genera un rumore metallico che è snervante per l'altra persona
5,all is good
5,I love my new headphone especially the controller piece for turning on and off and volume change is very useful and convenient. It s very easier to use the controller rather than going to software menu for going mute. It is well integrated with both Zoom and MS Teams.
5,Es el segundo que comprp
5,Good quality. Very comfortable. I've been using it for 8-4 job and it never hurt my ears.
5,Merci
5,Cumple muy bien al filtrar ruido en llamadas
5,Excellent product.  Really delivers.
5,Headset looks good works well on Teams/Zoom calls. Great sound
3,Al principio estaba enamorada de este headset era relativamente cómodo el sonido era muy bueno y las personas me escuchaban muy bien.A los 6 meses se rompieron de uno de los altavoces sin hacerles absolutamente nada fue cuando me di cuenta que los altavoces están sostenidos por dos pequeñisimos pedacitos de plastico si llegas a hacer un mal movimiento se rompen. A pesar de esto los altavoces siguieron funcionado por dos veces más hasta que un día de la nada uno dejo de funcionar.No los recomiendo si quieres algo para trabajo diario.Si trabajas con avaya no son compatibles nunca logré que contestaran mis llamadas desde el botón para contestar.
5,Been using this for a few months now with no complaints. Comfortable and does what it should do. People listening to me have commented that they can’t hear any background noise even when my dogs are barking loudly which is great.
5,Excellente qualité
4,Great sound quality but not very comfortable after a few hours. Needs more padding on the top.
1,Son caros bonitos y funcionan bien pero sólo por un tiempo. Son super frágiles  y el precio no vale el gusto de poder usarlo unos 5 meses. No los compren.
4,Great for the price. I do feel the build quality has declined over the last few years. But that might be consistent with manufacturing these days.
5,Love this headset...reliable bullet-proof and crystal clear sound...
5,Una alternativa práctica para estar conectado en el trabajo y para jugar videojuegos
5,Cumple con su función. Están ok
1,Se mueve mucho porque el control que está a la mitad de los cables está muy grande nunca estás cómodo.
5,Son perfectos para reuniones
5,use it for works pretty sweet
5,High quality product that I would recommend anytime.
5,Confortable using with glass frames
5,Have had this for nearly a year. Very comfortable can wear almost all day. Great for working from home. World recommend
1,No Box No warranty card on original and replacement provided by amazon. Manufacturers website includes them as part of what should be "in the box" listing. Items in ziplock bag. For $120 I expect the full boxed new item
5,I tested it for two days loved the sound loved the microphone but the ear cup started to hurt after the end of the second day. Had to return it.
5,Se lo he recomendado a todos mis colegas que al igual que yo están trabajando desde casa. Buena cancelación de sonido. A diferencia del inalámbrico de esta misma marca este cuesta menos de la mitad y también evitas la exposición excesiva a las ondas bluetooth que según algunos estudios pueden llegar a ser dañinas.
5,Lo rápido para conectarse y funcional q es
2,I have used Jabra Evolve 40 and also it’s wireless sibling Jabra Evolve 65.Bluetooth connection in Jabra Evolve 65 is not very stable both with mobile phone and pc using the Jabra link adaptor which comes along. I would any day pick up Evolve 40 over it’s wireless sibling for the stable connection it offers.Excellent comfort audio quality and noise cancelling microphone. However in my case both Evolve 40 and Evolve 65 started breaking at the joint after less than a year of use.
4,Product works as intended.
5,GRAN PRODUCTO DE JABRA Y EL PRECIO ESTUVO GENIAL
5,Perfect for work from home or office for video calls.  This fits over my ears and don’t touch or bother my earrings. I can still wear dangling hoops or stud earrings while using this.
1,Got one because a colleague has had one for some time and his mic always sounds great on Zoom calls.  Mine?  Terrible.  Crackly dull on USB.  Echoey and way over bright on audio jack.  Very limited frequency capture.  Cannot recommend for any usage whatsoever.
5,I purchased these headphones to use with dragon speak-voice recognition and they work great. I can listen to a little bit of light instrumental background music to help keep the office noise from disturbing my concentration. I have had customers comment on how clear I sound when on the telephone. The call and volume button is super convenient. Would highly recommend!
5,I have been using these for nearly 6 months five days a week. I teach - and my students have complimented the sound and quality of my voice. They are comfortable for this price range. They are easy to pack up and take with me when I leave school. They don't feel flimsy and don't look that way either. I enjoy streaming music in the background while I work and the sound works fine at this price point.  I'm happy. No more raising my voice trying to speak into the computer's microphone. It eliminates background noise nicely (no complaints from anyone). I feel more confident doing my job.  I might purchase these again. I may even purchase a higher priced pair as I would like to eliminate more wires and plugs from my working area.  For teaching virtually especially during Covid  this is one of the wisest purchases I have ever made.

5,L'accessibilité du volume du son et le débranchement tout au même endroit est très bien.
5,I’ve used these headphones in settings with dogs barking people coughing and road noise and any call I’ve been on NOBODY can hear the background noise. Epic noise cancellation for working remote. I was originally using these as given by an employer and when I quit and returned them I came on Amazon to purchase my own set for my new job. Best purchase price is decent compared to other online sellers.
5,Kids use for their distance learning.  They enjoy it.
3,Overpriced. But if you want a good commercial grade headset this is probably it. Overpriced. You got the hint!
5,Cómodo
4,Son de qualité casque d'écoute léger et confortable. Utilisation pour les rencontres TEAMS.
4,En general son muy  buenos el volumen es mucho mejor que un Sennheiser. El único problema es que lastiman al usarlos por varias horas (en cuanto a comodidad Sennheiser es mejor). Sin embargo los recomiendo MUCHO para 2-3 horas seguidas.
5,Sound quality is good.  Comfortable.  Price was reasonable.
2,I've used two of these headphones daily and the wire connector to the button/base often becomes detached/frays. This is normal use - just standing around with the headphones on. Eventually it breaks and the unit is uselessEverything else works great - sounds good nice buttons can wear for hours. Just sad about the lack of quality.
5,Sound quality is good.  Comfortable.  Price was reasonable.
5,Excelente producto lo recomiendo
5,Comparado con mis antiguos audifonos estos se escuchan bajos. De todas formas no necesito más vólumen del que ofrece. Me gustó el producto.
5,It worked without hassle
5,Ya lo recibí
4,Great product work well and the speech sound quality is great. Not wonderful for music but then that is not what they are sold for.
