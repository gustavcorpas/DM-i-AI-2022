5,I needed something to plug our hard foam hot tub into. This was great! It had an option where I could hang it and keep it off the floor. It was just what I needed for the space and hot tub.
5,Have used devise for 2weeks outside with no issues yet.  Have experienced at least 2 good downpours (approx. 1/2 hr) with no issues.
5,This has been fantastic to have on our covered deck!  Works well and no issues with the weather.
5,it what i expected
5,This is fantastic I love that I don't have to worry about leaving it outside on my patio
5,I bought a Backyard Discovery gazebo and realized I bought the one without the built in power station. They don't sell it separately so I tried this. It's perfect! Seems very well made and has a ton of inputs.
4,After about one month just a day outside of the return window the USB ports stopped working. I reached out to the seller and they promptly sent me a new unit which is working fine for now. I’m hoping the first one was just a bad unit and I won’t have any trouble out of the new one. The seller was very gracious and I did not have a problem getting a replacement so I appreciate the great customer service.
5,Yes like other reviews the outlets are a little hard to push a plug into at first bit after a few times they work just fine. It's been left out in the rain several times with no ill effects whatsoever. Great product!
5,Perfect for my outdoor application.Solid product and mounting was easy.
5,Perfect for the screened in patio. I load tested it with a plug in amp and watt meter. I ran my 1500-watt patio heater with no problem. After that it mounted nicely to the wall using 3/16” tapcons (used for masonry fastening). Later I plugged in a shop vacuum and it also worked fine without ever tripping the built in breaker. I needed a weather proof power strip because in afternoon thunderstorms in South Florida it can rain sideways at 50 mph (not to mention tropical storms and hurricanes). I would recommend it.
5,I needed some power in my gazebo and this was the perfect fit. Plenty of outlets and even USB ports for charging. The cord has decent length but I wish it longer for my application.It has a slim profile and mounted easily on the post. The color blends in well with my gazebo so you hardly notice it when nothing is plugged in.I would definitely recommend this product.
3,Plugged it in on my deck and stashed it under the table so it had some protection from the elements. I plugged in the minifridge and the pool robot into it.  About an hour later we had a torrential downpour thunder and lightening.  The next day I checked the fridge and found that it was off.  The circuit had tripped.  I know that's what's supposed to happen when an outlet gets wet but I was hoping that this outlet would prevent the tripping when it got wet because the water is supposed to go right through it.  I need to have the fridge on a reliable power source to keep the contents cold and frozen.  If I have to check it every day and reset the circuit I could have any ol' power strip and didn't need to spend $30 for one.
5,Recommended!1. Works Perfectly2. High Quality build and3. The four corner holes/eyelets are a bit small but very useful for tying the unit to my telescope tripod.4. Using two of the three usb ports for dew-heater strips and have had no problem keeping them going!It appears unaffected by the heavy dew we have recently had -and I like the water-resistant feature of this powerstrip.Now let's see how many years of wear I can get from it!  ;-)
5,Good for keeping connections dry…
4,This power strip worked out perfectly
3,I purchased this outdoor power trip because it had USB outlets and I had a lot of weather proof USB lights I wanted to us outside.  The USB outlets stopped working after 3 months.  The electric outlets continue to work perfectly.  I had plans on plugging in red-white-blue lights for Memorial Day to Independence Day.  All 3 pf the USB outlets went bad.  A huge disappointment.
5,Justo lo que buscaba... trabaja tal como lo describen en la portada.
5,I've needed an extra extension cord for a long time since i got a new Ipad and speaker  at last I decided to buy this one - I'm not disappointed thankfully. It has a sturdy plastic case and the switch has a plastic cover to prevent from water going in. although I'm not planning to use it outside but I think it will work well outside too.
5,My husband loves this.  Plus it has slits to mount it.
5,It does what was advertised.
1,Ordered this product to be an outdoor switch for my Christmas lights. It rained one time and the strip no longer powered on. The lights still work when plugged into the outlet. Garbage product and wasted money.
1,I am so frustrated ! My plugs won’t go in - it fits everywhere else but this power strip ! What am I doing wrong ?
1,The extension looks great! But it keeps shutting itself off it says that it’s supposed to only shut off when it exceeds the 1875 watts limits but it doesn’t have any more than 1250 watts on it as a loads. Why would you lie about the wattage in an electric extension?
1,I ordered three of these. They are all being used at an amount under their usage rating. I used one of them in my shed to plug in a small space heater. It melted the plug outlet on the multistrip as well as the cord end of the heater.
1,Advertised as outdoor use and waterproof. Actual packaging states to keep out of water and if exposed to water unplug until it dries out. Wouldn’t work for the outdoor use I had planned on.
1,Power strip stopped working after it was rained on one even though it claims to be water proof.
5,After more than 2 months of use below are my comments on this outdoor power strip.Likes:Build Quality-exposed outdoor for two months in a harsh Texas weather and it continues to work. See bottom line.Color finish -mat black color finish is ideal for my intended use as it doesn’t attract too much attention.Form factor - socket placement and overall size are just right as i was able to easily install it against my brick wall with all the plugs connected.Dislikes:None at the moment but I may have to update this review as needed.Bottom line:I have this installed outdoor and exposed to the usual unforgiving Texas weather. It already experienced a very humid hot day it got wet during a typhoon-like downpour and recently just chilled thru a couple of near freezing dry winter days and just continues to work. That said this is an easy 5-star.
5,Wanted something less industrial looking which was all that was available in box stores.  This is great and the mounting options were ideal for my Gazebo.  Looks sharp without distracting from the looks of the structure.
5,I got this for our patio. we spend alot of time on it. It had a good long cord and its durable and sturdy. I like the usb plugs. its made strong and its water proof. It heavy duty made and it's easy to install where you need it. Worth the price for a well made power strip.
5,This power strip surge protector is great quality in its compact size.
5,As a protector of animals this is perfect for my multiple heating pads for my outdoor critters. We can’t turn away the needy especially cats.Right now there are 6 heated pads plugged into this power strip and it works great. Especially since I only have one outlet in the back so I don’t have to worry about having enough warmth for the critters.It also has a couple of USB ports in case your animals need to charge their phones. Overall it’s a great outdoor power strip.
5,Love it
5,I like its waterproof design.Prevent my drink from spilling.It had a good long cord and its durable and sturdy. the usb plugs very convenient. Its made strong and its water proof.USB is very convenient for charging my watch and Bluetooth headset. I like it so much
5,I use this surge protector to run my wood pellet grill industrial fan and string lights on my screened in covered deck. Everything runs as it should even when the protector gets wet on rainy days. I wish the cord was a couple of feet longer but I'm still able to work with it.
5,Sturdy  plenty of outlets and a perfect accessory for our backup generator.
5,I had a very small area to fit a surge protector power cord. The long ones were too long and this fit perfectly in the space that I needed it too. I want to warn people that last summer I saw bees going into a power strip that I had on my back porch. They were nesting inside of the unused plug areas. I am not using this plug outside if I get one for outside I’ll get one with covers on the plugs. Be warned.
5,This item is out in the rain doing well!
5,Works fine. Very convenient when we're using phones computers bluetooth speakers etc out on the front porch.
5,It replaced the old one around our deck plus has a remote to set it or shut it off from a distance.
