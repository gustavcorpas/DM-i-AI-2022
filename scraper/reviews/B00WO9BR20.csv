4,I ran this from solar panels to battery and only got 8 Watts on full sun.  A shorter/thicker cable 3 foot male to male got 41 Watts.  Some loss is expected due to the length and the fact a coupler had to be used for it.  Probably okay for camera systems.  It does have a picture of a solar panel in the add but not recommended.  I will not give a horrible review but it could be thicker cable due to the length.
5,Perfect length for the security camera
5,It does what it supposed to. The male end was A tad to long but it fit nice and snug and my camera's are working great at A great price also delivery is fast 👌
4,Para extender  el sonido a otro lugar.....
5,Great
5,This was just what I needed to complete my camera install
5,Does the job of getting the power to the camera.
4,Good product and good price.
5,muy bueno como extencion
5,Do you have a security camera and wonder how you are going to get power to your cameras? Freight no more this will fix your security camera installation woes.
5,Fácil de instalar...
4,Used this as the extension to IR light unit.  After a run time of just a few minutes the wire became very hot (probably due to resistance over the long small diameter wire).  Yes:  It works.  But overheating /fire hazard concerns prevent me from implementing this component in a security system that is left unattended most of the time.
3,The picture is great and for the system that was relatively inexpensive that being said.The cloud storage is expensive the tracking is slow it picks up on every little thing on the motion detection even on low sensitivity and the system is not that user friendly I wish there were easier steps for the way you want your cameras to run
5,Muy buen producto
5,There is no dislike about this product handy flexible and good quality
5,I replaced my old Logitech security system with newer equipment over the 4th of July holiday last weekend and knew I needed more than the 10 feet they had for each camera for a few locations.  One in particular was going to be a test farthest run from an outlet.  So I got this one for that camera.Worked great.  The camera plugged into it without issue and I've had no problems with power to that unit.  Plenty of length for me to run through my gutters to keep it out of sight the way I had the POE network cable going to the Logitech.Great price does the job can't ask for more.
5,I don’t think there’s really a whole lot to say about basically a wire. The wire is pretty thin so you don’t need a large hole if you were going to be putting it through a wall and if you don’t used to do that you can also slip it under the door and because it is pretty small it won’t abstract or get caught with the door shuts. I think it’s definitely worth for what I paid for for 30 feet.
4,30 feet is a significant run of power cable for a 12 volt DC system and this cable seems to be able to deliver power to the home security cameras for which the cable is being used.  The camera power supplies are rated at 1 Amp and the camera peak demand is somewhere around 800Ma (8/10ths of an Amp).  I am seeing no problem in the functioning of the camera which would be likely if the unit is starved because the wire is too weak.  Other reviews have noted the size of the wire bigger = more power handling capacity. Without cutting the wire hand measuring the copper there are no markings to say.  But the power cable works.
5,I don’t like paragraphs so here we go:- reach: I needed to run cameras outside of my house and power them through the outlet in my garage. This extension cord made it very easy to do that with plenty of cord left over. So if you are going to be scooting around in the attic and needs more footage get this.- power: no matter if you plug this cord in or plug the camera directly to the AC cord it comes with without this extension the camera will power the same. It just works.- Durability: The cord is in my attic and running threw some small holes to get to where it needs to go. I have not had any problems with it.- Bottom Line: Get this if you are looking at your camera being yards away from your power source.
5,I have bought probably 4 or 5 of this 30 foot CCTV cable for my outdoor cameras. They work great and have held up outdoors and buried in the ground. If you do not have a convient outdoor plug since most cameras have a short power cord you will need to get an extension. I have used in some cases the full 30 feet and other times only 10 feet but it is better to get longer cord then end up short.
5,Good price
5,NEEDED A LONGER CORD FOR OUR SECURITY CAMERAS
5,Plug and play
4,It was compatible with the device and fit perfectly without any problems
4,The price was the best and honestly the product is worth the money! It works!
4,This gave me plenty of extra cord for my cameras. Easy attachment.
5,See above
5,The cable was heavier than I though it would be!  Than is important since its low voltage less voltage drop for the extend power cable..
3,Fácil de ínstalas muy manejable excelente
5,Used it to increase the length of my IR light for my security camera. Normal length was about 18 inches. This short length tied its use to a wall outlet. This wire connected allowed placement anywhere in the 30+ feet from the wall socket and allowed it to be mounted under the eaves outside.No issue worked as expected and connections were firm.
4,Install was fairly simple. Plugs fit tight. Only problem is resistance. I can't run these as an extension off of the original cables. Definitely not in a series. They might be fine if you're running wired cams with RCA or BNC cables but the drop was significant enough that my wifi cams either wouldn't connect or wouldn't start at all.
5,Got this to extend my power supply for my boss me-80...thought I was buying a 10ft extension...I didn't read close enough..it's 10 meters lol..my bad..but it works perfect!!!
5,Good cost
5,It worked for my use.
5,It works
2,It does power but I wouldn't not use on sensitive equipment.. I think the wire gauge may be to thin and you get voltage drop in the line.. it does work but I ran into problems with my camera systems with flickering and weird night vision problems from low voltage.
5,pretty fair cable just a spare in case original gets damaged
5,I used this to power up my outdoor security camera. No issues at all.
4,Worked as described the direction to installation of another camera or to operate other features are of poor explanation I wish they would have someone from the USA write or proof read instructions to give understanding. Wireless cameras set approx. 27ft thru glass window only 2 bars signal no sound capabilities are also downfall but I knew this and for the price of having extra eyes so to speak is cheap insurance. Set up of system was extremely simple and cell phone app no issues.I would give 5 stars if the instructions were better wrote by a  American English speaking writer who understands proper English.
1,These cords should not be used in an outside environment. They will let water in around the connection and short out the wire causing you electrical receptacle to get hot/melt/catch fire. If I could give the cables a minus stars I would.
5,If this doesn't work for you it is likely because your power supply is to weak.  Most power supplies that come with cameras are not capable of handling the additional resistance that naturally comes with a longer cable.  This often is not an issue for stationary cameras but if you have a PTZ camera you may find the camera works but the motors don't.  If this is the case look for a power supply with the same connector and voltage but with a higher wattage.
5,Good
4,Looks like great extension power cable.  I did not need it since the device's power cord was already long enough without this one
5,Great product
5,all good with this article but what I did not like was that the delivery man left it at the door without ringing the bell and falsely notified that I personally received it and signed the delivery.
1,I am very disappointed in them they would not fit my security camera or the plug in cord. I have Cobra that I bought from Harbor Freight. There was no one to contact about them. I ended up cutting both plugs off male and female and then cut my other plugs off and wired them together and taped them. Very expensive product to not work as shown. It is only size they make so I do not know why they would not be compatiable with each other and plug in to each plug. Real let down. I could have just bought a reel of electric wire and saved about $50.00. I do not recommend them at all unless you know for a fact they will fit your product.
5,It did the job
5,It works great for the camera I bought.
5,I used these to extend the length of my HISEEU wireless cameras power supplies... everything works great. Ant the delivery was super fast I ordered them at 3am and they were delivered same day @ 5pm
5,Works well
5,Skeptical but worked great no problems packed well and arrived on time.
5,STILL IN TEH PACKAGE.
5,What you see is what you get
5,Quality
5,Works really well nice and thin so it was easy to hide along my vinyl siding to attach to security cameras. Very pleased with the product.
4,Easy to install
5,Excelente producto y me ahorro mucho tiempo en la instalación de las cámaras.
5,Very nice long cord in Sterling
4,Well built cable and connectors. Have not really used it yet because onboard will access power ok. Being in Amateur Radio for many years I have seen many different cables and connectors. I think it was a good product for the price.
5,It worked well.I use these cables in a photo/video studio as an extension cord connecting my LED rim lights and the 12v power supply.(VILTROX L132T 0.78"/2cm Ultra Thin CRI95 5600K/3300K LED Video Light Dimmable Flat Panel On-camera Light Pad)(EPBOWPT 12V 5A Power Supply AC Adapter for 5050 3528 RGB LED Strip Light Low Voltage Device)It is far lighter than lugging around 60 feet of 120 volt extension cord.I generally have the lights running at 100% for well over an hour and there were no problems with the cords heating up.The plugs stay snugly connected. I would recommend this product.
4,I purchased this to keep the power supply inside and dry
4,This worked well for me but if you are pulling this through a wall or anything be aware you can't put much pressure on it or it will break.
5,Bought this for Couple camera installs and so far is been pretty goodI have no doubts about it
5,Excellent extension cord for 12 volt systems like security cameras and LED light installations. This cable allows you to mount the power supply a long way from the unit that is being powered allowing you to hide the power supply out of the weather or gives you many options on the placement of the powered unit that may not be close to a power outlet. For peeps complaining about the weatherproofing of the connections they do make something called duct tape\electical tape! ;)
5,Great to have so you don’t have to have an extension cord run all the way to within three feet of where you choose  to place your camera.
5,There was nothing to dislike really you may find them cheaper elsewhere but these so far has worked well. I'm using them with outdoor security cameras.
5,Saved my Arse worked fine though dont know if one wasnt working..Could be user error thats why aint takin any star off.
4,We got our cameras which really work well but we see they are 80.00 off you should have told us we would have waited other than that we like them but 80 dollars is a good deal we would like the deal is possible
4,Delivery was quick and product is just what i needed
5,We used this for areas where there was not a plug immediately available for the camera.  Works great!  Exactly as described.
4,Ok
5,I am glad I did buy this  my sons who are engineers liked it
5,Needed to add this to IR Light to get power. Works well. No Issues. Just plug in and run line. No issues.
5,Decent CCTV power extension
5,it was easy to install also a great value
5,This helped extended the power cord to my fiber power supply to an electrical outlet
5,I use this with a portable solar panel and it works great! I can get the panel far enough away to be out in the sun without having to bake my batteries out in the sun as well. Most small portable panels use a 2.1mm x 5.5mm 12v port and that's the case with my panel. Very pleased too that it's 30ft long gives a lot of leeway on where to position the panel.
5,Liked it works great
5,Does what is needed from it to extend power cable up in the attic to a outlet ! Very tight connection fittings for a great seal on both sides !These do fit the Hiseeu cameras !! No stars on tech support because I did not have to talk to anyone...
5,Easy to install
5,Worth the price.
5,I like the length it was just what I needed.
5,Excellent
5,Excellent extension cord for 12v systems like security cameras and LED light installations.  This cable allows you to mount the power supply a long way from the unit that is being powered allowing you to hid the power supply out of the weather or gives you many options on placement of the powered unit that may not be close to a power outlet.  Great product at a great price.  I highly recommend this product and this seller.
5,Lengthy and easy to connect.
4,The cables fit well to most 12 volt items (IP cameras IR lights). There is a bit of loss in power over the length of the cable though. When comparing the output of an IR light to a similar 6 foot cord there is a noticeable loss in brightness. Other than that they work well.
5,This product extended the length for my Smart Camera on the outside
5,Easy to Install and Great Value!
5,Plug and play. No extra hassle besides running the cable but that’s another topic. Definitely worth the price.
5,A Great addition for a Security Camera. No problems hooking it up. Worth the price!
5,Works as described. Used it to install a wireless 1080p wansview cam  (works phenomenal  btw) taped together with a cat 6 network cable. (Wired connection is quicker and doesnt lose connection.  It also works if wireless radio goes bad. Its also a a more secured connection i used these power cord extensions on all of my Wansview IP cameras. And they have never let me down!😁
5,Great length for your money.
5,This power extension cable was perfe6and very easy to install and very easy to fish in wall. I recommend this for all security cameras.
5,very long cord...does the job
4,Use it for one of my WiFi CCTV. No issue with it. The price is a bit high in my opinion.Would I buy another one? hmmmm I think I would see if I could get some better priced option.
5,Looks nicely made. Just used it after sitting on it a long while. I installed a IR spotlight for some extra lamination for a Amcrest PTZ POE cam I have installed under my porch. The cam has IR but does not reach far. This one hits the spot. I'll probably get another and then POE them or try. Adding pics before IR hookup and after.
5,does what its supposed to
5,Gracias súper bueno me gusta este producto
3,IT is good product. Not as a expensive one but does its job
5,Little difficulty on finding numbers to enter . I'm computer challenged .
4,Cable was just how it was described. I receive within a day an a half.  After I put it to work I order another one.
5,I needed this product.looks good.for my security camera.
5,System sets itself up
4,I needed it and it worked
5,Excellent product
5,Worked great perfect and proper extension for your cctv project.
5,Worked as should on my netview security cameras.
5,Easy to setup
5,Couldn't use it body camera that said doesn't need internet to make work. They were wrong. So I just bought something for no reason. And it's it's here on the floor.
4,It works......as it is supposed to!!!
5,Easy to install works at it should.
5,Bought to use with cameras but the cameras were sent back because of poor software. Sent this back too as I didn’t need it the .
4,Good wire. Works well
5,worked perfectly however I thought it was 10 ft it is like 30 ft. (Didnt measure)
5,Use the add lenght to install the camera.
4,Works well with IP Camera
5,Legnth was perfect and just what I was looking for
5,Very good service my package arrived a day early and I was very pleased with it everything was in order and nothing was wrong thank you guys very much
5,Perfect to extend the power cord to my camera
5,I bought it to extend away an IR SPOT light to help out with the weak IR light of a G3 ubiquiti surveillance camera it doesn't get hot or anything it just works
5,La calidad del cable es muy buena y cumple con su cometido. Lo volvería a comprar.
5,Easy to install
5,Como imaginaba
5,extactamente lo ordenado
5,If your installation is a distance from an electrical outlet then this is the perfect choice for an easy install. Priced right and well made.
5,Great product.
5,More than enough cable
5,Excelente
3,I used these to run electrical from the house to a security camera.  I placed them along the driveway touching dirt.  One died after 8 months
5,Definitely purchase with the camera
5,I used this to extend wire so I could reach outlet without using a extension cord. I feel that it will keep my camera working cause I could use outlet that is separate from any that has high loads already on it..
5,They truly care for there customers I had a problem with something and they got back in touch with me. And fixed the problem.
5,Haven’t used it yet but I’m shure it will work
5,It works great and was the perfect length.
5,VERY PLEASED !
5,Connections are solid and even after month of outdoor use no problems.
5,it works so good if you have to move your wifi cameras in places were is no power outlet
5,Just what I needed to hook up security camera
5,All
5,Easy to install. Wish it came in shorter lengths.
5,great price would buy again
5,Great made it so much easier to place cameras where. Wanted them
5,Bought 3 of these for my outdoor cameras and they have held up very well over the past few months of using thus far.  They are perfect in length for what I needed!  Will definitely buy again!
5,Made install easy
3,Pretty thin and when 3 are linked together it didnt have enough power to run one camera so if you plan on linking them together to reach a power supply for each camera then maybe try a thicker wire
5,Totally satisfied
4,Just as described
5,Great replacement product and fit perfectly bout to buy three more to expand my other cameras
5,Exactly what I ordered
5,Good Quality
1,I read about the small gauge wire. I thought that if I was careful running the wire that it would be ok. I was wrong. In under a Month I have had 2 of the 3 I ordered go bad. Now I am just going to order the connectors and make my own.
5,Just what I ordered
5,Great extension cords for adapter. Really long and if it’s not long enough you can buy more and connect them all together!!
5,Muy bueno
5,It is still working for my security camera. Neen used in an outdoor type situation for quite some time with no issues...
5,easy to use good product.
5,This was a very good solid product. I bought this to go with my security camera I bought and wanted to place out side. I did not have a power source close so I bought this to run to it. The length was perfect and the cord was thin and easy to hide.
2,I've purchased about 15 of these cables. While most worked fine six of them were defective at the male (camera) end. Poor (broken) connection inside the case. Manufacturing defect. Every bad cable had the exact same problem in the exact same spot. Test the cable BEFORE you run it especially when running in difficult places like an attic. When testing power up camera then flex cable at camera end. Many of my cables are defective causing the camera to lose power when the cable is moved. Rather than send them back I just purchased some connectors and simply cut off the original bad section of cable.
5,Works as designed
5,Got this for my outdoor cameras and have been very pleased with this purchase
5,I used this cable to supply a security camera with its own dedicated power supply. The video cable ran over 120 feet and was too long to supply adequate voltage to the camera  so I ran this power cable to the camera from an outlet about 25 feet away located above my garage. Now the camera has plenty of power to light the IR lights at night.
5,Worked for me on a 12VDC 4 amp power supply extension. Only think I did was added a toroidto the end that plugged into the device.
5,Great value
5,Easy to install long and steady
5,Didn't need tech support  pretty self explanatory.  But I rated tech support anyway lol.Great product works with my wireless night owl system
5,Love it
5,Exactly what I needed. Seems to be made well. Better than using extension cords.
5,Exactly what I needed. The least expensive and most effective way to extend power to my 12v devices
5,It works and no problem with the product. If you need an extension cord this is it.
5,great  went the entire length of garage  to secure camera to wireless camera to electrical outlet
5,Good description works well
5,A great extension patch for my outdoor pads cameras.
1,This cable was recommended for the Defender security Camara system however the plug ends are different and should not be recommended for the camera system. It now gathers dust in a closet.
5,Reliable product is what I want highly recommended
5,Great
5,It's a simple low voltage extension cord with the right fittings at each end for my purpose.  Works as intended.
5,Used this for my Wansview security camera as our apartment does not have any electrical sockets anywhere near the door. Just make sure you take the time to hide the wire well you won't like looking at it every day.
1,Wrong cord for what I want
5,xcellent xtension for cctv outdoor applications as well as indoor so long as you enclose inside pvc conduit to protect. very low power loss over 30 ft. makes it ideal for covert locations in bushes or discreet locations for surveillance.
5,Needed extra cord to run in order for the surveillance cameras to function...house is pretty big..
5,Works great for me. Now I can plug my security camera in at a more convenient plug.
4,Good
1,I purchased two of these. Ran the first one to my security camera plugged into the wall launched system software and did not power camera. Removed cable from setup and ran power all the way to the camera and it works. So I don’t know why these cables did not power my camera but these did nothing for me. Did not power camera.
5,Worked great extending the power supply line on my cameras.  Prefer POE but the deal was so good I decided to give the cameras a try.  The extension power cable allowed the extra length I need to reach and existing outlet.
5,Easy to install and set up
5,Works as an extension cord for my IR illuminator 850nm night lights
4,Not much to say. Its an extention.  Works for what i need.
4,Quality is as expected works
5,Works as expected. Have it going through an exterior wall and connecting to a security camera.
4,if works as expected.Just wish it came in white.
5,I utilized this extension cable to provide the power to my LED lighting around the pergola in my back yard.  I am going to purchase several more for other projects I have planned this summer.
5,Great quality and price
5,Out door camera power cord too short
5,I bought two lengths of this for our security cameras.  There weren't any issues and it certainly helped with putting in the electrical connections in the attic for the cameras.  These were also a good value too.
5,I was installing video cameras and I needed longer wiring to get the job done and this cable did exactly that.
5,They work as advertised. They arrived quickly.  We ended up sending back the system. The wires were great though!
4,Good
5,Nothing fancy just a Great cable for an affordable price. I used this for an outdoor camera install It has been running a couple of months now and no issues have been reported.
5,It is flexible and feels durable. Plugs are perfect fit. I guess that's all you can say about a cable.
5,Just what I was looking for for my outside cameras.Worked out just great.Would buy again.
4,Great product
5,Got to run power to POE camera but not using an NVR or POE switch. Works great and no limitation or signal drops
5,Just what I needed for my cam! Works great!
5,these work perfectly I have had no problem with these and they've been a life saver.I highly recommend these
3,Good length
5,Its exactly what i needed for my camera over my door.
5,Has a lot of different settings which is nice... Great value for the money...
5,Work perfect and they are exactly 30’ each
5,I bought this to use in my security cam outside. Perfect fit length and no complaints.
3,Well it's only a Power extension cable but it worked as it is suppose to when I hooked it to the camera 2 days ago. Only time will tell if it is decent quality.
5,it works
4,Product works fine seems a little thin.  Better then splicing the power adapter cable!
5,Bought this cable to work with a Zclever Wifi NVR security camera system. This worked great to power a camera that was farther away from the electrical outlet than I needed. I will buy more of these.
5,Gift for my son to extend this 4 camera system to a 6 camera system.  People at this vendor are very helpful and very nice.
5,Works perfect for my security camera im glad i purchased it because the cord that came with it was way too short.
5,I'm happy with the length of the cord. Definitely needed for outdoor placement. Make sure you heat shrink the connections to weatherproof them.
5,This works fine and is inexpensive. It is also quite stiff and hard to roll up when cold out if that is important to you.
5,Perfect extra length then needed
5,I needed to run a longer cable for an LED light to assist my security cameras.  This cable worked great! Would definitely recommend to anyone!
5,this was the ticket for my cameras just enough extra power cord to run security cameras for my camper.
1,Bought it to extend power to my TP-Link Archer router but it doesn't supply enough power to keep it on.
4,just what we need to put a security camera up
5,I am using it to connect cameras
5,Was looking to extend a cctv in my attic to a new power outlet.  This extension worked very well.
5,It does what its suppose to do which is extend the cable. Fine product nothing bad to say about it.
5,I love it.I feel more secure now. I can see whatever it's happening outside without actually going out.
5,Worked perfect to extend my IP camera power cords opposed to using extension cords. I’ve since moved to POE but this is a great alternative!
2,I just open this item has two male ends when I order supposed to have a male and a female  no good to me another saying it's over my return. Date
5,Works great
5,As described good quality fast connection
5,Nice
5,Doing what it's supposed to do and fast shipping
5,Not Bad.
4,Very strong and good to use.
5,Worked perfectly and did exactly what I needed it to do.
5,Functions as described.No problems after 30 days of use.
5,this cord worked out perfectly for my camera. I had mounted my camera outside the house and needed an extension to connect to a power outlet and this fit the bill. Worked really well.
4,ok
5,Just what I needed more like exactly what I needed awesome price great quality
5,We used this to plug in to our sequro camera system so we could have more length to the outlet.
5,Great cord to extend my wansview outdoor camera.
5,Help me a lot to install my cameras 👍
5,Works great for the camera. I bought 4 total
5,Worked perfectly. Connected to camera and ta da. Have had it for some time now and no issues. Packaging was good too.
5,This is a great addition if you have a long way to wire the Wansview camera up. It is small enough to hide in your siding.
5,It works.
5,Nice!
5,Great to use if you don't have an electrical outlet near .
5,I buy everything from amazon-
5,Love the product worked great by my pool
4,nice long cord to help hide wires up in rafters
5,The Firstrend Security wireless camera video is clear and good for remote viewed by phone and the customer services is quick reply and professional.
5,Tested one of these.  I am assuming all the ones I bought work.  Will be convient to run all my security cameras all to one location.
5,Everything looks great just have not had time to install. Going to try to get done this weekend.

5,Great product fast shipping
5,I love it !
4,Turns out I did not need the extension power cord was plenty long enough.
5,Perfect size and thickness. Very inconspicuous hides under the fascia well. White would be better.. I connected to security cameras  using this and a  cable splitter (1 female to 2 males)
5,Who needs tech support to plug in a cord?
5,extension for surveillance camera power supply - good length

1,I as many others got a cord that was not capable of delivering 1A down the cord. You had one job and you blew it Mr. Cord.  Multimeter confirms this.  I was dumb and did not test it first and wired it in my garage.  Now I have to return it and reinstall another cable.Do not buy.  There are numerous other products exactly the same at 30-33 feet that have cable that can delivery the current properly.  Exact same price or sometimes less.  Don't let the Amazon Recommended status fool you.
4,Great item and highly recommend....AAAA++++
5,Great
3,Would have given 4 stars if it was 30 feet and  5 stars if it were 10 meters ( 32 feet 10 inches) sadly was only 28 feet 4.25 inches.
5,A+
4,it works just fine for the cost
5,Its a wire! how much can go wrong. Seriously it worked fine in my application
3,It might work for small loads but it definitely won't work for anything over 500mA.  The cable is thin.  The loop resistance is 5 ohms.
5,Was long enough
5,It works
5,Good product would buy again.
5,It is flawless compaired to the Louwise PTZ 4X zoom camera
5,This power extension is made well and is working for my configuration.  I would have no problem ordering this product again.
5,Great Value
5,Funciono perfecto
5,great power extension to connect my camera
1,I purchased this to power a TP-Link AP500 wifi access point which uses a 12 v 2.5 amp power supply.  When using this cable the access point would only power on for a few seconds and then power off.  This is because the gauge of this cable is too thin.  This causes too much resistance which prevents adequate current from reaching the device. I measured over 5 ohms of resistance in the loop of this wire.I found a different cable made of thicker gauge wire (that is actually longer than this cable) and it measures negligible resistance and powers my device perfectly.
5,Good product work great.
5,Exelente
5,Worked as expected.
3,Thinner cable copared to other brands.
4,Works like it should.
5,Good quality and description.
5,These are great feeders.  Bees and wasps cannot get to the food.
5,Worked gre3
5,Product just as described perfect for my camera system

5,Great
3,good

5,Works great to get camera out further
5,Good product. Great picture easy to setup
5,Works as advertisers
5,as advertized
1,I ordered these not too long ago they decided to stop working and my whole feed went down I thought it was my cameras so I took the extension out and hooked up my cameras directly and they still work fine plug the wire extension back in and my cameras did not come back on.... definitely not worth the money.
5,Theft protection.  Works well clear picture
5,it was as advertised and worked as it was supposed
1,Amazon recommended this item. I ordered the Defender security cameras and it said this was commonly bought together with the camera so I bought it. I wanted it as an extension to the original cord but this recommendation didn’t fit. Now it just sits in my junk drawer. And no I don’t feel like send it back.
5,good product
5,Good price
5,Just like my headline. Great quality and low cost.
5,Todo excelente
5,It' works
5,Its reached it work  I 'am happy
1,Junk.  Voltage and current drop over 30' made camera quit each evening when the IR's kicked in.  12.35 volts at the supply and 11.95 at the camera under load.  Current dropped from 2.02 amps at the supply to 1.65 at the camera under load.  There should be information provided that this will NOT WORK for an IP PTZ camera.  For what ever reason Amazon pointed to this as a "purchased together" item and that led me to believe it would work with my PTZ.  WRONG GUAGE WIRE FOR 30' extension.
5,worked well to extend the power to the camera in the peak of the eves on the garage.
5,Works great
5,Product as described.
5,100% recomendado
3,It shorted my cameras out I ended up having to replace my cameras.

5,Must have extension cord
5,Great cables

5,I'm sure the product works great but I no longer needed it.
5,Works good
5,Fantastic!!
5,Worth the money
5,Great product
5,What can I say it's a power extension cord not much else to say
2,Does not fit well.  The female end fit ok but the male end was too thick to fit into the Phillips hue hub that I bought it for.  I had to cut my adapter's cable and extend it using the wired from this "extender" cable.  The internal wires were also very thin.
5,Awesome product
5,Perfect length
5,Good
5,everything i wanted out of a power extension cable for 12v dc
5,works great
5,Simple
5,Good
5,Great for setting up out door cam
1,When connected to my IP cameras it would cause them to half way turn on then shut off immediately. It kept doing this over and over again. I thought it was my cameras but when I connected their original power supply it turned on immediately.  Not enough power gets to the camera with these extension cords. Need to make it with a thicker gauge or not sell at all. Waste of money but most importantly my time.
5,Needed to hook up cameras
5,excellent good product I am very satisfied
5,Excelente lo recomiendo.
5,hook up system
1,The wire gauge  is so thin that my camera which runs on 5 votes at one amp can't even power up.  I had a cut 15' of cord out  and solder  the plug back on and I still had only 4.5 Volts to the camera.  They shouldn't sell  a 30' cord  Unless they're at least going to give you 22 gauge wire. Junk.
2,This has very small wire in it only use for low power devices.
5,Just what we needed for our EZVIZ Husky security camera.
5,I would recommend
5,Great way to get power to a camera far away.
5,Longer than most
5,Good value

5,Prompt delivery as advertised
5,Works well
5,Love it
1,Bought Defender Phoenix security camera. This item came up as recommended to purchase with the camera. I ordered this to extend the cable. This cable does not fit the end of the camera cable. Useless with this camera!
5,Versatile. Best value.
1,Wire is not capable of current and voltage supply for my 12vdc Hiseeu video surveillance & security cameras.Wire needs to be a larger gauge for its' intended purpose and use !Don't waste your time and money on this item !
5,Exceptional
5,Just what the doctor ordered!
5,Great  Quality of wire .
5,Works great for extending power to my security Cameras.
1,I would like to get a replace new product or refund either one.
5,Just what I wanted.
1,i ordered this at ya'lls suggestion when i ordered my DEFENDER cameras. it WILL NOT FIT MY CAMERAS found this out as i'm trying to install the cameras
5,Great
5,Good
1,Very cheaply made had electrician here to hook up security camera & ordered this wire for extension.  Once the electrician pulled thru the wall the wire broke in half so I had to run out & purchase another one while he was waiting.  Wire could be much more heavy duty.  Would like a refund as I had to purchase another one could not use the broken wire.
5,Great cable to extend the power for security cameras.
5,Nice product used for camera
5,Delivered on time and seems like a nice product.

5,Product is as described and works great.
5,Just what I needed for my outdoor cameras.
2,It's not keeping my camera on. It keeps going on and off as if the power connection is not hooked up right. Any reason why it would do that??? Could it be a bad chord?
5,good product works well
1,This item was recommended for purchase with CCTV light or IR illuminator. It starves the light and reduces output significantly. Will keep looking...I am sure it is great with lower amp items but not effective for IR light.
5,Great buy works great
5,It works as intended.
5,perfect
1,Never got to use it because the camera I bought didn't work.
5,what the heck?? it's an extension cord..
5,Great for my wansview security cameras.
5,great product
1,This power extension cord was nothing but trouble constantly loosing contact until the end finally slipped off making it unusable. Forced to order another as it is badly needed to supply power to a security camera. Does the seller have a warranty against a defective product?
1,The gauge of wire used for this length (30 ft) was too small to pass enough current to run a DC inflation pump.  When I patched this between my power supply and the inflation pump it ran at a fraction of the RPM needed to inflate an air mattress.  I can't imagine it would pass enough current to run many electronic devices either.
5,extedned the power wireless system
1,I returned the item unused and explained why when returned.
5,Perfect
5,Good quality extensions worked well for powering security cameras.
5,Working like a champ

5,Works excellent on my AMCREST ProHD IP3M-943 IP Camera
5,It works as designed no issues.
1,This is the 2nd of these Vanxse®cc'tv 10m(30ft) 2.1x5.5mm Dc 12v Power Extension Cable for Cctv Security Cameras.It just doesn't work.I instead used  large orange extention cord I already had. This worked fine. Have had no problems since.

5,Good product.
5,a must
5,works great
1,this cord does not supply enough power to be useful for anything but the led's on any of my cameras complete waste of money.
5,works well
5,Descent cables
5,Cord is shipped in a plastic bag.  Very neatly coiled molded ends no worries about not wiring it properly.  Am pleased with the quality of the cable.  Order this one for worry free installation.
5,Good product.
5,Was as expected.
5,nice a heavy duty
1,I bought this cable because Amazon listed as "customers also bought together ". This extension cable will not work if you are using it for security cameras with infrared lights for night vision. Don't waist your money.
5,Good product.
1,This cable has far too much resistance to work for most applications.  The voltage drop causes my wireless security camera to drop every 30 to 60 seconds.
5,well  worth the money!
5,works as expected
5,Great extension. Good price. Works well with foscam 12v cameras
5,Good it work
2,worked for a week and then it shorted out
5,as advertised.
5,Works with VSTARCAM C7824WIP.
5,Great product and service.
5,worked great.
5,perfect for long runs
5,Good
5,Nice
5,works fine
1,Out of 4 - 1 item died in 3 months - return window was already closed. Expecting other cables to go soon.
1,This power cable is paper thin. Pulls apart very easily during install. Don't waste you money pay a little more for a much better product.
1,Gauge too small for the length. Does NOT provide the necessary voltage
1,Straight out of the box it did not work very disappointing as this was for my work computer.
1,Rats ate them all. Must be a chemical in the coating that attracts them. They didn’t last a week
2,Itgmy
1,Completely BS. Doesn’t hold the current at all. Bought 8 money down the drain. Cheap crap.
5,cable works.
1,I measured the cable continuity with a tester and it was faulty never worked.
1,Not worth it. Doubt this can handle more than 1 amp if even that.
5,very happy
5,as advertised
1,three of power extension wire were in the second box
1,I ordered camera with power cord. Got cord but no camera.
1,The camera I bought to go with this had a design flaw and couldn't be mounted as advertised. Tricked into combining order with this extension which charges +$5 to return even though I paid $9.50 with no shipping.
1,No
5,Works great.
5,Works as promised.
2,Fine if you're powering something with little draw as Guage is thin otherwise look elsewhere. Fails to power my security camera with spotlight. Runs okay until the camera draws more power for the spotlight and then camera will die from lack of power. Tested this 3x with same results. Purchased a better cable and the camera works fine.
1,This cable was recommended by Amazon on my home page for my Amcrest camera - I bought it it came it doesn't fit!
1,The camera doesn't work with this cable.
1,Male end doesn’t fit into ADT camera
1,Voltage drop  would not power camera.
1,Producto devuelto
1,I bought this for my new cam "Amcrest UltraHD 2K (3MP/2304TVL) WiFi" and it didnt fit!
1,The product didn't work at all
1,Can't use it one of the items needed to use is in back order for now useless
1,Returned

5,Excellent purchase to extend the power cords on wireless security cameras.  They worked perfectly with my Lorex security system.  Thank you.
5,Works perfectly. Meets my needs and the price was right.
5,Works great extended my power cables for security cameras
5,High quality. Very nicely put together.
5,works great with the camera that I purchased.
1,I put all one stars because I've contacted u and I have to put a serial number in to get the system working but I can't find it .. so I've tried to email u and nobody gets back. I want to figure out what needs to be done.. if not ill call amazon for a refund because I don't even have directions.. but online I figured look their and I need to enter in a serial code and to card possibly .. I NEED HELP PLZ I EMAILED U AND ITS BEEN AWHILE SINCE I BOUGHT THIS. I AM HOME ALONE W A 15 YR OLD NEW STATE NOT SO GREAT HERE WAS BEAUTIFUL YRS AGO WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PLACE BUT NOW I NEED A CAMERA. I AM CRIPPLED AND I DONT WANT TO FEAR THINGS HOME OR OUT.. PLZZZZ HELP
2,This cable is very thin.
5,Works great with our outdoor security camera. I was able to tuck the wire into the channel of our siding to hide from view. Fit perfectly and snug on the camera’s cables.
1,had to return
5,Easy to install but no installation required
5,Perfect item perfect seller.
5,Used for installing my security cameras
5,So far so good the cord is working great for me
5,Okay
5,To connect a security device
5,Work perfectly for my wireless cameras
4,Cerre la puerta de mi casa y el cable sin cortarlo quedo en medio de la puerta y la pared y despues de ese leve (machucon) en algunos paises dicen (Majar el cable) y otros dicen contraminarlo contra la puerta y la pared dejo de funcionar y esto que el cable no se corto. Los materiales deben ser mas resistentes.
5,Great
5,Easy to set up and just what I needed to install new cam
5,great
5,This is my second camera extender cable. The first one was just as perfect as this one however because of my own fault I didn't properly staple it and it got caught in the garage door and ripped off.  The length of this extender is amazing for the price. You don't realize how long it is until you actually use it to extend the camera cable. I always say it's better to have a longer extender cable and keep a portion of it rolled up next to the meeting cable then to not have enough cable and have to wait for another one to be delivered. This extender is perfect for security cameras and has plenty cable enough two adjoin the camera and wall outlet cable.  The speed of delivery and quality of this product makes it the obvious purchase.
5,Works as they should
5,Bought this for my new camera set up. But didn't have to use it. But tested n worked as it should.
5,Good
5,Perfect
5,Unwind it and it works.
5,good product for the money
5,Perfect for what I needed
5,Thank you
5,this cable made it easy to plug in my security camera
5,Great extension cable to power my additional camera I installed. Tech support for hiseeu is amazing
5,Does the job.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Dislike nothing about it like the length.
5,perfect long enough and working. Thank you
5,Good deal
5,Buena calidad y es lo. Que se describe
5,Demasiado bueno fácil de instalar
3,My review is this using two extensions on your closed-circuit camera with this type of extension would not operate the camera correctly it's good for one but if you connect to to try to reach the power source that you need to plug into it would not work for that I give it a thumbs down three times for that I give it a thumbs down three times
5,Holds voltage great
5,worked
5,Works well
3,It’s very easy to use but the connector at the end is not well it don’t hold the other end
5,You're going to want to get some tack downs for the cord but works great I ha e 8 cameras and it works great with all of them
5,Perfect fit for my camera hook up!
5,Thinking of ordering more
5,no fuss just works good price fast shipping
5,Good
5,Value for money .
5,Works great as intended. Very good length for the price.
5,I’m glad we ordered the extra wire so we were able to put the camera in the back yard. I think when they sell these products and the cameras they should have a phone number to contact there technicians.
5,It's a good quality material for indoor outdoor use this to replace a wire on my chicken coop that seem to dry rot fingers crossed this holds up better
5,was super easy to hook up and made  insulation very easy it only took me 30 minutes to install
4,Just like oem
5,Added to security cameras on pilings and needed the extra length.  Simple plug ends and you have the extra length.
5,Everything works as it should.
5,Just what I needed
3,Yep
5,Works perfect for what I need. Gave me the extension I needed to reach an outside location. Be sure to keep connection sealed from the weather. Used insulated staples to attach cable to surfaces. Very happy with the product and price.
5,Works exactly as needed for my camera.
5,Todos muy bien 👍
5,It is hard to really review an item like this. It was cheap appeared to be made good enough and worked exactly how I needed it to. I would buy the product again if I had more need of this type of connector/wire.
5,This item came in handy thanks Amazon
5,Works great and does what is needed from it to extend power cable to the outlet.
5,Nice
5,nice long length not a big bulky extension cord glad I ordered it with my camera.
5,Worked wonderful with my dekco security camera.
5,Works great used it as an extension to connect Ring spotlight to solar panel on other side of house
5,small easy to hide or bury.
5,Perfect to run power to my IR light for security camera system.
5,Good
5,WORKS FINE NO ISSUE
5,This is a very good product maid it easy to connect to the camera
4,Just a power cable  works as expected
5,extension that is convenient
5,Easy to use. Works well
5,I purchased this to extend power to my Reolink RL-410W. It works perfect for this application.
3,Made camera install easier
5,Bought twoplenty of wire. Went where my husband wanted them.
5,Buy! Buy! Buy!
5,Really great product for what it is it's exactly as described would have no problem
5,Does what it says!
5,Had issues with old wiring on cameras this one works fine
5,Thanks
5,Not relevant
5,Plenty long enough
5,Returned didn’t use
5,Cord well packaged and fit  well.  No issues. It is an extension cord for an AC adaptor
5,Camera worked fine with it. Very long wire. I think I will buy their shorter wire later. I didn't need so much. Would buy from this company again. Great price and it worked.
5,Good
5,Nothing much to say about this besides it works as designed. It's a 10 foot power extension cable I use for an outside IP camera. I have had no problems with it so far.  I guess the only thing that could be an issue is the thickness of the coating if an animal was to chew it but since it's mounted high and doesn't get near the ground it shouldn't be a problem.
5,SURVEILLANCE CAMERA EXTENSION.
5,Thank you very much Fit like a charm
5,good
5,Easy install
5,works very well. thx
5,Did what it was supposed to do
5,Very long
1,As others have said this this is WAY too thin. Was hoping to use it for a CCTV that has built-in LEDs for illumination. The original power supply was 12v 2 Amps.  I would be surpised if this cable handles much over 500mA.
5,5
5,Great product
5,Cannot say anything bad for this cable. Looks amazing. Works amazing. Priced reasonable.
5,I don't really have a review regarding a cable cord it's a cable cords it works.
5,Long enough to do the job and then some!
5,Very useful and good value for money
5,It did the job making it easy. I totally recommend thos product
5,It's very handy for camera power supply
5,Nice product
