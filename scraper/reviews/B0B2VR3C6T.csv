5,Great lighting with many settings. I got this for recordings for YouTube and it is great. It is sturdy and stays on the floor very well.The light you can use has different shades. It can be warm light and you can adjust it to cold light. It also has colorful setting but I don‚Äôt see how I might be using it from a practical point.I like that stand turns directions and you can place your phone horizontally and vertically easy.I tried taking few pictures and it lights the face very well and definable improves the quality of the end result.My bird likes it too and uses it as a stand to sit on lol.

I always struggle to take good pictures because my lighting is always terrible. I love taking photos but needed something to give me the best lighting possible. I got the  EICAUS 12 inch RGB ring light tripod. This ring light has transformed my photos tremendously. The amount of modes and transitions that are available to change my color or light preferences made me love using it! This ring light is great for selfies photography live streaming and video recording.This ring light is also a tripod to be able to stand at various heights and can also hold your phone to be hands free as well. The tripod is moveable to be able to choose what angle and direction you would like your lighting or video and photos. In addition it comes with a wireless remote and is pocket sized. This ring light can be easily moved from room to room or from one location to another outside the home. Overall I haven‚Äôt taken a photo or video without this ring light since and I definitely recommend it to help elevate your lighting and photos too.
5,This tripod with lighting was absolutely perfect! I used it for a party and the photos came out great! I love how you can change the height and different shades of lighting. You can make it super bright or dim. I also love the remote it is easily linked with bluetooth for android or iphone. This is a must buy!
5,For this price this is a good set up. The tripod is great quality and very sturdy. Holds light and phone perfectly. The light is very bright and has several different color and brightness levels. I wish it came with a remote for changing the colors and light patterns but for the price I can‚Äôt complain.
5,I wasn‚Äôt expecting much for the price but holy crap. It‚Äôs literally nicer and more sturdy than my $200 ring light. And farrrrrr more color options! I look better in red and green light and never even knew! These ring lights have come a long way and this one is no exception.
5,The light is nice and bright I like the touch controls and I can change the hue of the light. Tried it out last night during my stream and all worked perfectly. It's a great ring light and I definitely recommend it.
5,I'm older and I found this ring light and I'm glad I can see better on my computer and I can add my smartphone to the ring light with a screw-in adapter for a good price. highly recommended.
5,My Amazon purchase history is full of Ring lights... I just had to get this because of the rainbow lightning and it's great.On a scale from 1 - 3 I'd rate this a 2 at a very low price. So a great purchase.
5,Nice ring light bright and lightweight. It‚Äôs nice because I can connect it to my portable battery instead of only the wall.

In addition to optional brightness and hue of natural lighting it also has the option for RGB.  Thin includes solids of reds greens and blues but also effects.  Its difficult to capture the effects on camera but imagine a strobe light in a bar and that is what its like.  The tripod has great height range adjusts to 62 inches with its telescoping pole.  Each piece locks in place.  Its very stable and secure which makes the phone holder more useful because Im not concerned it won't hold during use.  It also comes with a bluetooth shutter that will operate your phone remotely.  This makes it great for selfies and videos.
5,For the price you can‚Äôt beat it. It‚Äôs an RGB ring light. What more can you ask for?
5,Works great for what we need.
5,good quality and super cool light colors

Does everything you need great low light and nice high lights. The RGB lights are excellent. Best bang for your buck. Plus you get a Bluetooth remote to set up to your phone for some great selfies without having to set up your timer

5,I was worried this was not going to be sturdy especially with the height of the stand. However it is perfect height for my needs as I am putting it over top of my monitors for when I am streaming. I was hoping for more of a rainbow light as shown in the picture but that's okay. It does have different options that will suit me for the things I am planning on using it for. It is very light weight and made of quality material and super easy to use. I was able to assemble it in minutes. Well packaged and it arrived early so I like that too.

Low key fancy bc it‚Äôs touch sensitive. Thing goes over 6‚Äô high. It‚Äôs literally sturdy as me! And I got it for just over $25 (w/coupon) but even at 35 dollars every bit of worth it! I had a basic white light before but this one is the glow up! So for this price hell get 2! One for home‚Ä¶ 1 for on the go! Never know when you might have to shoot a movie ü´£ü´°üòç y‚Äôall bout to see me every where. Wanna know why?! Bc I got the right lighting! Now say I‚Äôm not a Supa star!!ü§©üòé oh and it came in less than 12 hours. I‚Äôm doing my hair to take pictures nooooowwwww! Yea get 2‚Ä¶
5,No problems at all. The touch buttons control the hue and brightness of the lights which is a great feature. The accompanying tripod is light weight and perfect for indoor applications if you want to use it outdoors I would recommend adding some weight to the feet. The remote control for taking photos and videos is always a bonus.
5,Really good value for the money! Very good for shooting. Excellent lighting for any type of visual artist as well. Arrived quickly and in great condition. Highly recommended!
5,It's easy to assemble and the tripod is sturdy enough for me since it's only for home use. You can lighten or darken multiple colors. Kids love it.
5,Totally worth the money and my pictures and videos are clear and high definition! Especially using my galaxy s22 ultra
5,This light helps with the tone I like to set for my podcast not I can start recording my videos. So many different colors you can dim it and brighten them as well
5,Rugged construction easy to use and great light levels
