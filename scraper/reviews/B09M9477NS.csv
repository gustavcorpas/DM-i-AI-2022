5,At least I hope so. While ASUS does source some production to China ASUS is a Taiwanese company and the sticker on the router states “Made in Vietnam”. I’m inclined to believe that. The product origin on this page states “China” but I doubt and hope that’s not true. You may not think it matters but it does more than you might know.Most consumers only care about speed and affordability when it comes to routers but it should be security at the top of the list. All your data flows through your router including personal and financial data. Security flaws in your network can also affect neighboring networks around you. If you buy a cheap router based on speed capability alone with huge intentional security flaws built in you’re basically paying hackers to hack you or your neighbors or possibly funding attacks on your entire country. It has happened it’s still happening and will continue to happen being partially funded by the victims themselves.Most routers today are produced in China. Even companies based in the US produce there and it’s very hard to find one that’s not made there. The problem with routers made in China is that businesses there are controlled by the CCP government and their stance on hacking seems to be “do it as much as possible when ever possible”. It’s why some of their tech companies like Huawei have been banned in numerous countries. Aside from that routers made in China from brands like Wavlink which are sold in big retail stores like Walmart and even here on Amazon have been found to contain hidden back doors and intentional security holes and vulnerabilities to malware like Mirai. Basically open doors for hackers. Some of these back doors have been used in the past to launch cyber attacks (Mirai botnet) on the US which caused major network outages as well as in other countries. From a cybersecurity perspective these look a lot like “trial runs” to me on a weapon being installed into our very homes. But speculation and paranoia aside why take the chance on inviting that kind of tech into your home? It wasn’t an isolated one time event when these back doors were discovered and it was with various routers and companies out of China.I have tried some routers made in China those from Shenzhen being the most suspect. I could tell they had horrible security just by using the app or during setup. One was capable of remote access yet the option to turn it on or off was non existent. It didn’t even ask during set up and the option was nowhere in the app. Remote access should always be turned off unless you need to access your router from outside your home which is rarely needed for the average user. If it’s on it’s just an unnecessary access point open for hackers to attempt access. It might have been possible to check by connecting directly to it using a browser but instead I just returned it and went on the hunt for non Chinese routers. It took a lot of research since there aren’t many but finally landed on this one.I am much much happier with this ASUS router and it seems very security focused! There are numerous security options available in the app and also asks you about remote access during set up. It has AI Protection by Trend Micro built in (included free of charge) which constantly monitors your network for viruses and intrusions and even blocks harmful websites. You can also monitor all connections and traffic through the app. There are even additional apps you can download for more functionalities. Just awesome.Whether some components of this router are produced in China there’s no way to be sure. But Taiwan is a free and Democratic country and ally to the US. It’s businesses are not controlled by the Communist Party. I’d rather trust ASUS than the Chinese companies any day especially since there’s so much proof of China’s shady tech and ethics.As for speed wifi 6 is awesome. This thing is lightning fast to my previous ISP provided router and much more stable. If you’re not familiar with wifi 6 it’s not really a speed booster. It provides a more stable connection though even in very signal-congested areas such as apartments or offices where there’s numerous routers and networks overlapping and causing interference. This more stable connection will often times yield higher speeds. Your PC and various hardware must be wifi 6 capable to utilize it but there are cheap and affordable USB adapters available to enable it on your PC if it’s not already capable. Aside from that the 5G signal is stable and fast even without wifi 6. There are options in the app to monitor what’s connected at all times and you can even limit bandwidth to certain devices or ban them from connecting completely if you want to streamline your connections.You can also reset the router from the app instead of the monthly power cycling one should do to clear the cache and restore the fastest speeds capable. By that I mean unplugging the router for one minute to clear the cache then plugging it back in. I am not sure if it’s the same but it seems to work the same as far as restoring the fastest speed possible. If so it’s so much more convenient. You can also update the firmware on the router from the app.There are a lot more features to this router which are easily accessed from the app which appears extremely robust compared to the rinky dink apps I used with the Chinese routers. Those seemed like toys compared to this.Completely happy with this router based on speed stability capabilities and most of all security!
4,See update at the bottom of the reviewThe Asus AC66u b1 and Netgear R6700 V3 are the two best under $100 routers you can buy.  I own both and will review them against one another (go to the bottom of the review for quick recap).  Quick history on bothHardwareNetgear R6700 v1 was basically the R7000 minus one USB port and the inability to connect at 600mbps in the 2.4ghz radio channel (pointless unless you have an AC 1900 client).  Netgear then switched factories and used a Mediatek CPU chip instead of the broadcom found in the v1 version this version was labeled the 6700 v2 (also has a sticker on the package stating "dual core CU" rather than "1GHZ dual core" on the V1 & 3) and is often sold in Amazon Warehouse so be careful about purchasing a used R6700 router.  The Mediatek chip is subpar in performance compared to Broadcom.  Netgear switched factories again and the current new V3 version uses a BCM4708C0 CPU chip along with Broadcom radio chips BCM4360 & 4331.The Asus AC66U (no B1) was originally a draft AC router using the same CPU chip and plastic housing as the Asus RT-N66U just with an additional AC radio.  Asus then upgraded the router by using the exact same hardware as in the Asus AC68U 1900 AC router and placed it in the new AC66U B1 router while still using the old plastic housing.  So yes the AC66U B1 is a 1900ac router not a 1750 router.  I know this as I have a 1900AC wifi card in my PC and it will in fact connect at 600mbps on the 2.4 wifi signal.  If you don't have a 1900 client then the point is moot and remember most clients are 2x1 or 2x2 even modern cell phones and laptops.  The Asus AC66u B1 uses the same BCM4708C0 CPU as the Netgear R6700 v3 with the broadcom BCM4360 radio chip.Both routers also use 128mb and 256mb of memory and offer beam forming (you also need a client to support beam forming for it to work)Optional firmware (if interested)both will run ddwrt & tomato the Asus also gets Merlin's version of Asus Firmware.ReviewPros - Netgear R6700Fantastic range on the 2.4ghz and 5ghz signal & Fantastic throughput on the 5ghz signal.  My router is on the main floor; standing in a far corner bedroom upstairs from the router (about 30ft from the router plus floor/walls) I receive 80-85mbps down on 5ghz while standing next to the router I would get 110mbps down on 5ghz.  Signal strength comes in "good" as per my 2x2 AC client laptop.  Upload speeds were also excellent on the 5ghz signal.Stable router and firmware once i set the SSID I've had no issue with the router with no need to reset it.  Setting up the router was about a 4 out of 5.  The software is OK and firmware took a while to update. Setting up network names and passwords was fairly easy through the web page.Router runs cool thanks to its large plastic housing.Cons- Netgear R6700Mediocre throughput on the 2.4ghz signal.  While the signal is strong I received 65-70mbps down regardless if I stood next to the router or in a far of bedroom.  Upload speeds were also mediocre.The router is large compared to the Asus.Netgear seems to have several phone apps and all seem ok or useless.  I would not recommend the Genia app for setup use your PC web browser.Just one USB port (if you are wondering what the point of a USB port is this is a none issue for you)Pros Asus AC66u B1Very good range and throughput on the 2.4ghz and 5ghz signal.  Where the Netgear router was giving me 80-85 mbps down in far corners of the house on 5ghz the Asus was giving me 70-75 mbps down on the 5ghz and 2.4ghz with my latop stating connection as good to fair.  Standing next to the router i received 100-110mbps down on both radio signals.  The range on the Asus is slightly shorter than the netgear but the router does offer better 2.4ghz throughput than Netgear.The firmware offers far more features than netgear and is easier to "play around with".The Asus app is fantastic and can easily be used to set up the router.Offers 600mbps on the 2.4ghz signal if you have a 1900ac client.Smaller housing than the R6700 v3.Two USB ports on the Aus vs just one on the Netgear.Cons Asus AC66u B1small housing means the Asus will get warm to the touch (not hot) but it needs solid ventilationAfter 18 months of no issues I had to start resetting the router I think to help cool it off as we don't have cable and stream constantly (from 7a to 11p non stop) with up to eight different client connections between phones PCs laptops tablets and smart TVs.RecapGet the Netgear router if you just want to set up your router and forget while having most of your clients on the 5ghz signal.  While the range of the 2.4ghz signal is excellent the throughput is mediocre.Get the Asus if you use the 2.4gh signal more than the 5ghz or have and plan to use a AC1900 client.  Range on the Asus is a small step back from the netgear as is throughput on the 5ghz.  The Asus also offers one more USB port (USB 2.0) as well as a better app user software and the ability to run Merlin.  The Asus is also smaller than the Nighthawk housing but will also run warmer.Update; I posted this review two years ago and it has gained a lot of traction especially with the current covid 19 lock down and I appreciate all the votes.  I still recommend both routers but for the money there are better options out there especially for the Netgear 6700 as it was down to $65 two holiday seasons ago and is now at an all time high price.  The asus ac66u has remained steady in price since two years ago.  Investing your money in dated tech that has not dropped in price (or increased in price) is not a wise investment.So what are the best routers for under $100?Note- Avoid AX routers (AKA Wi-fi 6) for now they are all draft AX routers meaning the AX standard is not finalized.  While AX routers are the future these current routers offer A) features that may not be active yet (OFDMA a key AX feature) and may never be active if new firmware is not released and/or updated by the user.  B) many have issues with older 2.4ghz N clients C) are rather expensive for real world use currently the main benefit of an AX router is for 2x more throughput in 2.4Ghz for AX clients (if you don't know if your mobile device is an AX client than most likely it's not). D) Forthcoming 6Ghz will require new hardware in another year or two's time making the current AX routers nothing more then expensive beta testing.For your money I recommend Wave 2 Qualcomm based routers.  The modern Qualcomm SoC perform as well or better than the broadcom equivalent from a few years ago run cool and are offer stability with most mobile clients.  The negative side I find broadcom plays better with older wi-fi clients so something to take note of and stay with Netgaer/Asus if that is the situation.1 - TP-Link A9 1900 ('Ive recently tested this router and was impressed enough to swap it out with my home netgear router)Pros -Uses a Qualcomm QCN5502 SoC (modified IPQ4018)a few bucks less than the netgear 6700 or Asus AC66Ueasy to use mobile app and desktop UI (see youtube video for set up) that is better than any netgear offeringslightly faster 5ghz performance than the netgear 6700almost as fast 2.4ghz performance as the Asus AC66Usmaller housing than the netgear router (equal to the Asus but runs cooler)you can combine the 2.4 & 5ghz radio signals into one SSID name allowing the clients to choose the best signal (AKA smart connect) or have two separate namescan be controlled by Alexa (you can turn this on or off in the UI)guest network for both 2.4 and 5ghzhas four antenna (one internal and three external)consdoes not support third party firmwareUI is limited in optionscan be controlled by Alexa (you can turn this on or off in the UI)some older clients may stick to the slower 2.4ghz signal in smart connect rather than the faster 5ghzone USB port and it's 2.0 (this will be a non-factor for most people)2 - ASUS RT-ACRH17 AC1700 (the update to the ACRH13)Pros -Qualcomm Atheros IPQ4019 SoCAsus AC66U B1 performance for around $20 lessGreat Asus UI firmware and mobile clientUSB 3.0 portfour antennauses same small housing as the AC66U but runs coolerconsfour antenna can be uglyone USB port (if you need more than one)does not support Asus Airmeshdoes not support merlin firmware
4,<<TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS AFTER REVIEW -- TL;DR: MODEL NEEDS FIRMWARE UPGRADE TO MESH>>I give it a bit lower value-for-money rating because I got this on Prime Day and I thought it was the exact same as my other 3 AX55's but it is not. The fact it ran sub-$70 was less of a bargain given that this model is a slightly lower-specced one.Still with all the other Amazon points I got it for free (at least practically so).Unfortunately having read some of the reviews I was led to believe this model will NOT support AiMesh (nice thing to worry about while out-of-state and can't test for 2 weeks) but it does -- however you MUST UPGRADE IT FIRST! The practical upshot of this is that it WILL cover your deadzone or extend your coverage BUT you need to set it up twice: once to get it set up as a regular router connected to Web and then install the firmware upgrade; the SECOND time to change the op mode to AiMesh Node wait for it to blank itself and then add it from your master gateway.I will leave my TS tip because it was NOT straightforward:1) wire it to a PC or laptop2) do the initial setup upgrade and mode switch3) once it completes resetting KEEP IT PLUGGED INTO YOUR DEVICE but activate a SECOND connection over WiFi to your existing mesh. **This MAY not be necessary but since I had the option I chose not to physically disconnect from the AX1800S just in case. You can try without doing that but this DID work for me. YMMV.**4) give it like 3-5 minutes to add and then I recommend rebooting the whole mesh once you are certain it connected.Either way for a theoretically free mesh router I could stick on a side wall upstairs to cover some... roaming IoT devices... can't complain. Does what is advertised. But ASUS may want to clean up their website for its specs and the AiMesh list. Like just say "AiMesh: YES (needs newest firmware first)". Done.So hopefully this will have been helpful to the disgruntled AX1800/RT-AX55 vs AX1800S customers elsewhere in the reviews.> pics related: you can see it is online AND shows up in my node list
5,Edit: I changed the rating to 5 stars from 3 because the router itself is really nice and quite effective in spite of some woeful errors and misleading information in the manual and quick start guide that made it frustrating to get it setup. See added comments below.Wow. Yes so far after spending some hours trying to connect and configure this router--it works well it seems. No I'm not completely set up but things are working for some devices now. What's my quibble? Very little about the "quick startup" and the manual "quick start" instructions matched the actual router well enough to get off the ground. Astonishingly tech support was totally unaware of what was not working and I had to stumble around while they were escalating to get into the setup menu by alternate means.1. The URL for getting into the router's setup failed in Linux with two browsers. The browsers (chrome and firefox) changed the typed URL I gave it to a generic asus url. I could not get them to trigger the router's internal ddns to give me the setup software.2. Chat help gave me a standard baseline IP to login: 192.168.1.1--didn't work. They couldn't understand why. It turned out that the router's internal initial IP was 192.168.1.50. Wow. Heads were spinning at Asus Help Chat.I eventually got into the router's setup (while waiting for the "escalation agent" to arrive on the end of the line. Then the setup menus were not as shown in the pdf manual on the disc that came with the router. It would be really nice if the folks that update the software would update the manuals before releasing it all to the world at large. Really bush league for a first rate hardware company like Asus. I have super Asus products that I think are first rate. I am shocked at how poor the instructions that came with this router were in spite of how good the router seems to be.edit: it continues. There was a one sentence statement in a menu that implied that router login authentication could be more secure by making it via "https" so I clicked on it. Nope locked me out until we agreed to reset to factory status by putting something in the pin-hole reset button. Bingo 4 hours of setup disappeared but I was in again. Grrr. Totally inadequate documentation of what that would do and the inference that it was going to make logging in more secure. Grrr. The documentation of this device is well-intended but grossly out of date and also it seems woefully inaccurate in some places where things get really important.edit 2: I made this 5 stars because the router is really nice now that I've had 2 weeks to use it and tweak things. I should say that I have been dealing with multiple routers as technology has advanced for over 20 years. Overall the menu system is good and reasonably well-documented within the router. The idea that the Quick Start Guide and the manual both failed to give me information that got me logged into the router from Chrome and Firefox within Linux is quite dismaying and a first for me. The idea that even Customer Support did not have the correct IP for logging into the router is astonishing. Logging in from Windows (which I almost never use) worked for the login url and I was then able to change the base IP to a value that fit the static IPs in my system.Customer Support was earnest and polite. I was passed from a first line tech to a supervisor and the latter suggested a couple of things to get past the "https" lockout and then said I'd have to do the "pinhole reset." I assumed all along that I'd have to do that but was hoping not need to start over with setup which I had spent a while doing. However the reset did not affect the firmware upgrade I had performed and I had notes for all the manually defined IPs and their corresponding MAC addresses and so redoing the setup went pretty quickly.Performance: I had purchased the router because it was recommended by Nvidia support that getting a router with MU-MIMO capability was a good idea for enhancing streaming as well as one that was dual band. This router is 3x3 MU-MIMO and in addition it provides stronger signals from the other side of the house to my livingroom where the important wifi devices are located. Greater range would be overkill that only exposed my LAN to more of my neighborhood. Speed is great for streaming to my streaming box and Smart 4K TV. Three walls and about 40 feet of distance between the router and devices is no problem. I am still tinkering with the QoS settings to see how that affects things. I have yet to use the internal VPN and it was suggested by my VPN provider that for maximum speed with VPN I should stick with clients on my computers and individual devices since encryption and decryption may be demanding for router processors.So....I can recommend the router strongly for those who can get past the hiccups imposed by the faulty documentation. I still have not explored what exactly was being suggested in the menu system about using https for better security in accessing the router menus and I doubt I check that box again any time soon. Changing the login username and passwords should be safe enough in my somewhat isolated location and moderately low tech neighborhood.
5,We were having buffering issues with a Sorry router. I saw this at $69.99 and thought I would give it a try because it has Aimesh as a feature.  I plugged it into the Spectrum modem and with 10 minutes it updated it's firmware and set up the entire network. It does not inxrease the network speed but provides excellent network management.  We have no more buffering problems.  It also has parental management options which appear to work excellent.  The app software has a sophisticated futuristic look and if you simply follow the directions it works flawlessly.  Signing into the Asus router web site with a computer is a real pain.  But all you need is the app.  I purchased a second one of these and set up a node for a downstairs weak spot..  The key is to activate it and update the second unit firmware.  Then reset the unit.  Do not hook it up with the Ethernet cable.  Hit the plus button in the upper right corner and the software does the rest.  This is a real and active network management system and is easy to use.  Would highly recommend.
4,The guy who claimed a .25mi range is lying through his teeth ignore his review.The range is ok not bad but not good.  It's processor is generally weak adding 3-4ms to your ping.  The wizard adds requirements that are not requirements just skip it an manually tweak your settings.  The fact that the router configuration redirects to a subdomain of asus generates some security worries for me.aside from that last bit about what I would expect for $60.I dont like the fact that the antennae connect on the back rather than the top or sides so hanging it where the cables are not kinking around the router means the antennae point downwards which feels... just wrong.
5,I was worried that I would be disappointed because it wasn't the AX55 model.  The installation with the app was easy and straight forward no issues. After installation I went back in and set up guest networks and changed the security settings.  I'm happy with the coverage the router is providing I'm getting better signals at the fringes of my house. I am upgrading from an outdated Airport and am getting much faster speeds with the ASUS router. I will update this if my opinion changes due to performance degradation.
5,Use this as an access hub in a separate office at my house. Covers the 1500sqft out building with ease. In fact all my neighbors for a few houses probably know my network name. Fast speeds even faster than my Orbi mesh inside my house. Phone ap is very helpful once you learn the navigation.
5,This is great.  The only thing that was not great was that to use some of the security features you have to agree that Trend Micro can collect all of your internet usage data and it was unclear to me if that data was secure or how it would be used.  Something to think about or at least research.  You can use it without the Ai security features enabled. It has all the typical security features otherwise.
5,Used it to extend my ASUS AX6000 WiFi 6 Gaming Router (RT-AX89X) using the AiMESH feature.  Its not easy out of the box.  Had to follow the Asus Youtube video to setup but here is the quick 1-2-3 to use as AiMESH.1.  Boot router and get it on the internet.  I plugged a switch port out on my main Asus Router to the WAN port on this one.2. Setup the AX1800 just enough to update with the latest firmware.3. After update log back in then on or around the firmware page click preform factory reset.4. While it is reseting unplug everything BUT power.5. Login to your main ASUS router and run the AiMESH wizard.Do not use the phone app I never got it to find the XAX1800 but the wizard on the router did in seconds. after the firmware and factory reset per ASUS's YT video. Was up and running about 10 more seconds after that.
5,I bought this specific model to tether a USB hotspot and it works great for that purpose. The range is fantastic and it has been stable without any resets.
4,Increased wifi speed. So very happy. Pretty easy setup but did have to call support for one thing. The had me fixed and off the phone in no time.
4,Capable 2x2 80mhz ax mesh unit for not much money.  Not Merlin-capable.  No USB port so no Entware addons even then so not as good choice for a primary router. Wireguard for example would have to wait until it is native in Asus firmware.
5,Great little wifi router. Does everything I needed. Dual band so everyone on 2.5ghz while I'm on 5ghz.
5,I HAVE 16 WIFI DEVICES ON THIS AND IT IS FAR END OF HOUSE AND WORKS FINE. NEED A CELL PHONE THOUGH TO HOOK IT UP.  CAME WITH SECURITY SO ALL IS FINE. 5 G TOO
5,I needed a router that could send a strong signal from one floor of the building to the one below through 6inches of rockwool to reach the repeater so that I could plug in a PC via ethernet.To my surprise not only does the signal reach but it actually does so with a strong signal. The Netgear wifi router reached the repeater but would only download about 10mb/s. With this one we have about the same signal strength and down/up-load speed on both floors.If I had to do it over again I'd pick another ASUS AX1800 wifi6 router
5,Just received this and set it up with no problems. The easiest router I have ever connected.  And fast!! Oh my.  So glad I traded my 10 yr old router in for this.  Highly recommend.
5,I'll keep it simple. After owning several Netgear and Linksys routers I saw this one and purchased it. It's a newer router than I'm used to but its performance has been flawless. It covers much more area than my previous routers (check the specs for details). The added extra security is a definite plus. It gives the ability to filter content per device for your kids. Firmware update have been easy to do. The only things I can pick out to complain about is that it's not as easy as it should be to add devices to your MAC filter and I would like to see a better alert/indicator system if the internet is unreachable. It would be easy to do via the app or at least have a light that indicates that it does. The light seems to just indicate that your modem is reachable even when the internet is not. The app will tell you that it is unreachable after you load it and wait for a status.
4,I bought this after a failed attempt at using a cheaper unit by another brand for a repeater. What I really needed was a way to use an old rooted cell phone as a modem and a router to manage the connections taking some of the heavy lifting off the phone. After some research I settled on this unit.It is not short of features. I love the fact that it still offers a Repeater mode instead of WDS which gave me a fall back if my USB tethering didn't work for some reason. It does have the AiMesh option though if you want a WDS-like setup. I wasn't even shopping for the repeater option but given my success with it in the past I was happy to see it.When it arrived I plugged it in connected to the default 5G network and went to the web page described in the quick start manual. I started the quick setup process but it did not work for me. Not a big deal I simply chose manual setup. I plugged my old phone in to the USB 3.0 port and went to the USB Application tab chose 3G/4G turned USB Mode to "On" and selected "Android Phone" from the drop down list. Applied and after the router restarted I was online.I then moved on to installing a network printer. I plugged the printer in to the USB 2.0 port chose the USB Application tab again and selected Network Printer Server. I downloaded the utility to autodetect the IP address then followed the directions for Windows LPR. My printer was working on two computers.I then started testing things by powering off the printer and turning it back on. Well the router wouldn't auto-detect the printer after this. If I unplugged the USB cable and plugged it back in it would. So I figured it was a firmware issue or configuration issue in my router settings. The first thing I did was back up my configuration and then upgraded the firmware. This did not help even after restoring my settings.What did help was to go to the Administration tab click on System and then under USB Mode choose "3.0". After this I could power the printer on and off and the router would automatically detect it. I had one random crash of the router when I restarted the printer. Hoping it's just a fluke or a minor bug that will get worked out in a future firmware update.Because of the hurdles in getting the printer installed and also the long boot times of the router and additional wait time until tethering can be re-enabled and my internet is active  I decided to dock it one star. Bottom line is I WOULD recommend it to friends and family but would have to ensure they have the information above so they don't have the issues I had. Now that it's running it's working very well though and I can't complain.
5,I know very little about any tech. bought this to upgrade my older router. was highly rated in tech magazine.  so far working perfectly.
4,This router allows you to micromanage practically everything a consumer would reasonably want to control such as white listing MAC addresses (wireless MAC filter) redundant USB/Ethernet WAN setup client lists dual USB ports with file sharing and etc.*HOWEVER* I personally found set up of the features I mentioned to be much more difficult than I expected.- The MAC filter is toggleable between both 2.4ghz and 5.0ghz modes and you have to set up the MAC addresses on both lists individually; if you have a lot of devices this is super annoying. Also you have to "add to list" and then also "apply" before switching between the list for 2.4ghz and 5.0ghz or once you switch you will lose all the progress on the list you started with! Also about 50% of the time when you label the MACs you put on the list the interface will not display your label instead just display "new device" and you have to refresh multiple times before the label comes back and the next refresh it could disappear again until you refresh again.- The "convenient" USB/Ethernet dual WAN set up is AWFUL. The interface did not match any of the documentation that I could find in the end the only way I could reliably get it to "work" was totally counterintuitive. I went to use a tethered cellular phone and though tethered cellular phone is an option... in my case I had to use tethered modem as the option AND in order to get it to work instead of using the USB as the secondary device I actually had to use USB as PRIMARY and then just let the router use the ethernet port as backup when I unplugged the phone. Again the documentation lays out how to do it but none of the steps in the documentation I found applies the controls mentioned in the documentation don't even exist in the UI in some cases.- I never even managed to get file sharing to work.Overall it's a decent router especially for the price. It's just not a whole lot of fun to set up.
5,I love this router.  I was a long time WRT54G user but then I was having throughput issues with my internet connection and that old router.  I upgraded my connection from 25 Mb to 100 Mb but was still only getting 25 Mb through the router.  It turns out the old WRTG54G was hitting it's throughput limit so it was time to get a new router.  What I liked with the old router was the ability for the community to choose a 3rd party firmware that could potentially be still in development after the manufacture has abandoned it.  I wanted this in my next router so I looked for some current offerings with this ability.The Asus RT-AC66U_B1 seemed to fit all my needs;1) something that would handle higher throughput speeds from my ISP2) gigabit interfaces3) affordability (there are $400 routers out there wtf?)4) a good CPU capacity dual core5) an open platform supported by the user communityIn order to save some money I ordered the router from Amazon Warehouse.  It came in a timely manner and in the condition stated in the listing description.  I powered the device up and promptly performed a hardware reset in case the previous owner had not.  I then loaded a third party firmware for AsusWRT-Merlin which does some backend patching and UI polishing.I'm very impressed with what I'm able to do with this router.  The performance is also worlds apart from my previous device.  I have the router in a far corner of my ~2500 sq ft 2 story house.  The 2.4 Ghz signal is reachable everywhere the 5 Ghz signal isn't reachable in the farthest point of the house.  This doesn't bother me as that location is the guest room  If I were to move the router to a more centralized portion of the house the 5 Ghz would be reachable everywhere.I now have a 150 Mb link from my ISP and there are no issues hitting that from the wifi connection.  I don't foresee needing more bandwidth for quite some time and outside of some sort of hardware failure I envision this router lasting me the better part of a decade.I haven't had a need to get into some of the more advanced features like QoS and parental filtering but I like these being here as the household grows up and my internet traffic needs some more shaping/restrictions.  I am very pleased with the built in AiProtection it's very impressive this type of network monitoring and intrusion prevention are in a sub $100 device.  Generally speaking the feature set in this router leave a lot of headroom for needs of mine that may arise in the future.Overall this router is more than suitable for the vast majority of the population and has exceeded my every expectation.  I am very happy with the RT-AC66U_B1 and only wish I would have ditched the old WRT54G awhile ago.  Highly recommended to anyone reading this in consideration of this product.
5,This product is extremely well built and has a ton of features. My only complaint is the range can be a little bit short at times but given its price point this is totally acceptable and it still adequately covers my entire house. Far better than what my ISP provided me.
5,I replaced my $250 Tri Band Netgear router (a piece of ____) with this one easy set up and it actually boosted my speed through out the house. I use the old router as a bridge.Buy this!
4,Everything seems good except something is wrong with my dual band.  The interface allows definition of both 2.4Ghz SSID and a 5Ghz SSID.  But when set up the 2.4 ssid only works on 5G band and the 5G SSID is not working at all.  Even turning off 5G didn't allow 2.4G to work.  The 2.4Ghz SSID definition is locked to 5G channel selections and the 5G SSID always says channel 0 and fails to broadcast.  What I tried to fix:- flashed firmware to latest then factory reset:  same problem- multiple configurations no 2.4Ghz ever worked including trying it as Guest network without 5Ghz- flashed the firmware with 3rd party "Merlin" firmware then factory reset - exact same problem.Other than the one requirement for 2.4Ghz we have (an old printer) this would be a fine router.  The 5G works great and I'm getting nice throughput with my wifi 6 phone.  I have to assume there is a hardware issue if both firmwares have the same problem.  I followed an asus support person's recommendations including the firmware upgrade and factory reset.  But after testing with Merlin firmware and seeing the same problem I assume it cannot be solved other then sending it back and I didn't have the patience to continue waiting for a support response.  I am just purchasing an alternative router and will write this one off as bad luck.  Unfortunately I see a number of people with the exact same problem reporting about it online with various asus routers of this era.  So whatever the problem is it is not super rare.  Some said firmware fixed others said Merlin fixed.  For me nothing fixed it.  I guess my local second hand store will be getting a free 5Ghz router with a note attached about 2G not working.  I'm sure many don't need 2.4Ghz and can use it.
5,Moved from an older router and the speed difference is dramatic. We have 1GB Google Fiber and are now enjoying the full speed. For the kids we use Cisco OpenDNS to control site access and setting up the DNS for that is easy on their computer - and it also allows for IPv6 - and no downgrade in speed.Setup was very easy:  minor IP conflict with our Ooma but quickly resolved. (My issue not due to the router.) Good mobile app:  can do most everything we need to on the app except it is a bit buggy. Still worth downloading.Great value!
5,I bought this to extend my other ASUS router out to the garage.  Paired with the main router and works beautifully.
5,Strong signal and fast speed
5,Use this cheap AX router as a node for your room computer and connect your computer with ethernet cable.  This way better with AX wifi card.
3,I have bought many ASUS products over the years and have been very happy with them.  Overall this is a very solid wireless router.  Having said that I have to say I am very disappointed that you have to give up your privacy to use a number of the "advanced" features such as QoS or the traffic analyzer.  It seems that ASUS outsourced many of these features to Trend Micro.  Which is fine except that in order to use them you have to share your data with Trend Micro.  When you go to enable one of these functions you get a pop up window that says:By using AiProtection Traffic analyzer Apps analyzer Adaptive QoS/Game boost Web history you agree to the Trend Micro End User License Agreement.Please note that your information will be collected by Trend Micro through AiProtection Traffic analyzer Apps analyzer Adaptive QoS and web history. You also acknowledge and agree that ASUS is not responsible for neither the agreement between you and Trend Micro nor any content of the service provided by Trend Micro. If you may have any inquires about how Trend Micro collects processes and uses your above information please refer to the privacy- related statement issued by Trend Micro or contact Trend Micro for more details.TrendMicro Privacy PolicyPrivacy and Personal Data Collection DisclosureIf you would like to disable sharing your information with Trend Micro through the above functions please go to: Router web GUI > Advanced settings > Administration > Privacy.If you follow the links one will go the their privacy statement and the other to an unrelated webpage.  Their privacy statement is long and complex so plan to spend 30 - 90 minutes to read and fully understand it.  So you figure ok I can opt out over in the Privacy section no big deal.  Except that it says:Administration - ASUS NOTICE( for privacy )Please note that users are required to agree to share their information before using DDNS Remote Connection (ASUS Router APP、Lyra APP、AiCloud、AiDisk) AiProtection Traffic analyzer Apps analyzer Adaptive QoS Game Boost and Web history. At any time users can search the contents of the terms at this page or stop sharing their information with other parties by choosing Withdraw.If you turn on the feature then use the Withdraw option the feature is then disabled.  So because of the privacy issues I had to take 2 stars off.
5,One review stated that this router will not work as an Aimesh node. I have one integrated into my 4-node Aimesh system right now BUT I did have to perform a firmware upgrade first toversion 3.0.0.4.386_67593.
4,The single biggest reason that I purchased this router was the ASUS ability to be an OpenVPN Client and I just can’t get that to work. Part of the reason might be that the router on the other side is a TP-Link router and that is upsetting the balance but it shouldn’t. I can use the same certificate on the laptop to connect seamlessly every time. I just can’t get the router to work as a VPN the entire time.The security features are great. I’m in an area that I’m concerned about the possibility of nefarious types breaking into my router. After going through the different security recommendations I feel a lot more comfortable. There is a screen that will secure your router by adjusting the following settings automatically (if you let it):Default Router login username & Password changeWireless password signal strength checkWireless encryption enabledWPS disabledUPnP service disabledWeb Access from WAN disabledPING from WAN disabledDMZ disabledPort Trigger disabledAnonymous login to FTP share disabledDisable guest login for Network Place ShareMalicious Website Blocking enabledVulnerability Protection enabledInfected Device Prevention and BlockingSome of the above sound made up but given the chance the router will fix all the loopholes for you to at least give you the feeling of being more secure.It’s also pretty feature packed. The GUI interface is easy to navigate and I never felt like I was just lost. I did have the check the owner’s manual for some things which in hindsight were pretty easy to find.Aside from the VPN the only thing I could not get to work was the Wireless MAC filtering. I tried this to further secure my network and again – I fell short of getting the system to work. I fully concede that it might be user failure but it didn’t work seamlessly. That was a bit disappointing.Aside from the two points above this is a great router. Very dependable and consistently puts out a strong signal throughout my two-floor apartment. I get one less bar on the second floor on the opposite side of the apartment but that’s not a terrible signal degradation and I still get faster WiFi than LTE connection.Pretty good overall.
3,Came with broken antenna refunded right away. For some reason ran really slow using it with asus mesh
4,Wanted an interface to try to control some of the (expensive) bandwidth being used. It also allows me to pick whether I want to connect to 2.4 or 5 signal. Was quick to set up. No troubles so far. We will see how it lasts.
5,Provides good reliable service.  When I switched from comcast cable to tmobile wireless internet there were no problems hooking up the router wirelessly to t-mobile.
5,When I was first trying to connect this device I was having trouble.  I called their customer support line and was helped immediately and my problem was solved.
5,replaced a linksys N 10/100 router. i have old macs that are 10baseT networking and the linksys would not hand shake with them. this asus has no issues with DHCP and its got much better speeds on wifi. ive only got 300 meg internet but this allows full speed up/down with router in the basement and phone or laptop on the 2nd floor.interface has lots of options more than im using right now. a good router and a good price
5,I did quite a ton of research on routers before I made my purchase.  I am paying for 30mbps but can usually clock at least 40mbps on a good day.  The screenshot shows 36mbps and it seems to be because the ISP is having issues lately.  It is definitely not the router.I had the choice between one of these and a Netgear Nighthawk.  I chose this brand based on personal experience with Asus as a good brand and also the recommendation of a 20+ year IT professional. Plus for the price this was an excellent deal!  Specs performance and quality are solid.  I'm clocking faster speeds than I'm paying for? Yes! I have close to an 800 sqft 1 bedroom apartment and the router is placed in the living room. This baby is obviously overpowered for the small space that I have but I plan to grow into a larger home soon. I spend all of my time in my bedroom right now because I'm waiting for my couch to be made.With that said the signal is strong enough to come through the doors and there is no lag/hiccup with the router itself.  The ISP (Spectrum) is a whole different story as previously mentioned but I digress.The user interface of the router program is fairly simple to use if you are not a network administrator but if you are there are plenty of controls at your fingertips.  You can filter out websites MAC addresses create separate passwords for 2g and 5g bands and so much more.Overall for the price range the benefit of getting faster speeds the ability to really customize my user experience and internet capabilites I would definitely recommend!
4,It works but I paid for a new one and they sent me a used one
5,Replaced a still working older model Netgear router and increased my up/down speeds by more than triple! From about 12-18mbps d and 5mbps up to 60mbps d and 11-12 up.Also has further reach via wifi.Not only is newer more secure but faster is so much better. :D (Used with my own SB6183 on Xfinity network.
4,I have 2 of these working together as a mesh.
4,Overall its A pretty good router but here as some must knows. I’m pretty decent with tech and this thing took me almost 1.5 hours to set up the original connecting to the internet was fine(I am using it to write this review) but connecting to the app? Forget about it. It had me connect to my device more that 10 times and still didn’t log me in I went through their tech support and they asked to get access to my computer? Knowing some stuff about computer I knew that this option is simply able to be bypassed usually anything a sales person can do on your laptop you can as wel as long as they walk you through it so red flag red flag. I ended up going to the ASUS website direct and was helped by a man named John T. Who didn’t ask for access to my computer. He walked me through most the steps and had trouble as well and ultimately after about an hour I just asked if he could email me steps to finish up what needed to be done to connect to the app. The router.asus.com website crashed multiple times and was overall flawed. If you are looking for a good router that’s cheap buy this one if you were like me and wanted a good router and extra features for monitoring it seems that it’s a hit or miss with most people I guess I just missed on this one. (I am connected to the WiFi please have that known the router does allow this)
5,I originally bought the Google wifi 2020 to replace a 4 year old netgear WNDR4300V2 due to online school in New York as we needed to get better speeds and range.  The google wifi was a mess with very slow speeds and constant buffering so I sent that back asap.  I went online and checked every site I could for router reviews and this Asus router kept getting recommended for range and speed as well as ease of set up.  Ordered it the day after my Google wifi return went through hesitant because I didn't want to make a mistake and have to do another return.I can pleasantly report that this router has exceeded my expectations it has giving me twice the speed and range in the furthest part of my home.  My son no longer has complaint's or even uses an excuse that he cant follow along in class because it would constantly buffer while learning.  I am truly happy with this purchase and truth be told 've only had it for about three days and my excitement is highlighted in my review  but as of now I can whole heartedly recommend this for most everyone in a home 2500sq ft or less even though it can go 3000sq ft according to the specs.  If for any reason I have issues I will report back and change my review if you need a router this is a major major buy in my opinion.
4,Like:The Graphical User Interface is pretty easy to navigate.  If you don't understand what option you might be selecting just so no and research later if you are curious as to the functionality.Router is set up in a Campground with another same model used via Ethernet as a Router about 50 feet further. It appears that the external node is only carrying with acceptable coverage about additional 75 feet.DisLike:The biggest dislike is that this unit was not engineered for heat dissipation. Over the last 2 months I have noticed internet service drop-offs and outages through the router itself.  The IPTV channels were and continued to perform as expected. Through some trial and efforts I finally realized that this unit has very poor heat dissipation.  The unit is designed to sit on a flat surface with a fractional air space underneath provided by 4 foaming stick on friction pads.  The unit was running very warm of hot to the touch.  Once I shimmed the unit to have more underneath airspace it was only mildly warm and began to perform as expected and previously encountered.The  AC1750 seems to provide a very stable router experience as of late.  Your options may be to find a router that does not lie flat on the surface that may have better heat dissipation or purchase a horizontally mounter version and closely monitor it for heat any remediate as necessary.
4,Replaced a 4 year old TP Link router that served me well but was disappointed in the throughput speeds. My cable internet service allows up to 150 Mbps but I was getting only about 25 Mbps down and 10 Mbps up with the TP Link at 2.4 GHz. I installed this Asus router then a quick speed test and WOW! The Asus is giving me 160 Mbps down and 12 Mbps upload at 5 GHz and 50 Mbps down and 10 Mbps up at 2.4 GHz.I've also noticed a big improvement in stability no disconnects and extended WiFi range.  I was able to eliminate a couple of WiFi extenders.A number of users of similar Asus models reported they can run warm so I wall mounted and used some 3/8" thick stand-offs behind the router to provide an air gap against the wall. Overall I'm very pleased.UPDATE 12-29-2020I noticed today that router and power supply were running warmer than I remember. No unusual activity or loading. Checked router case temperature with a non-contact thermometer and got 124 F.  Keeping fingers crossed that this will not reduce life of the router or affect performance. I'd prefer not to have to resort to fans.
5,My 3rd Asus router. I received it yesterday and configured it today as a wireless access point for my pfSense router. My internet is 150/20 and both wired and wireless report speeds of 180/25. Wired speeds as reported by lan speed test free to a NAS are also quite fast. It replaces a Netgear r6400v1 that will perform wireless bridge duties now. My former wireless bridge an Asus (T-Mobile)TM-AC1900 will have 'brain surgery' performed on it to see if it can be converted into an Asus RT-AC68U. If it lives it will become a spare main router and a wireless bridge for another room.My first Asus router was an RT-N56U. It was given to a family member who uses it as an access point in a large home. It's still a good router. Reliable x 10.I had originally ordered a Netgear R6700. I returned it unopened after discovering how fluid Netgear is in replacing perfectly good V1 models with V2 models without specifying it in the sales description. I read that the R6700 is now a R6700V2 and may be less reliable than the original model. I was very happy with my Netgear R6400v1 but the higher valued R6700 is  on sale and at a  lower cost at this time.Asus went to great pains to note this is a RT-AC66U-B1 at Amazon. The reviews gave a good impression. Subsequent research makes it look like it is upgraded from the original model and close to an AC1750 version of an AC-RT68U model an AC1900 router but at a much lower price. Very nice. Who cares about wireless-n at 450 vs 600? Not me.Update a couple of days later: The conversion of the TM-AC1900 into a full RT-N68U succeeded. I took it from the 'newest' 3181 firmware to the current Asus firmware. There's a lot of steps but it's a reasonably forgiving process too. The wireless on the Netgear R6400v1 seems a little stronger at a distance so it remained the  access point attached to my wired pfSense router (note it's a v1. Netgear v2/v3/v4 updates are all different routers and not necessarily comparable even if they have the same main router model number).The Asus routers will be media bridges for now. The ASUS AIProtection on both routers looks interesting. It has the potential to adequately replace my pfSense router (uses SNORT and pfBlockerNG) if needed.
3,I bought this specifically to improve the 2.4 Ghz band of my wifi setup which is fed by cable modem with 250 Mbs of throughput.  I have many IOT devices that only use the slower band some of which are far enough away from the main router to drop signal occasionally.  I wanted to use ASUS's AiMesh technology to resolve this issue.  I documented my pre-AiMesh setup using as scientific of parameters for testing as I could (multiple locations two devices:laptop and cell phone and multiple speed tests at each location).  Then I added the RT-AC66U B1 to the network (as the AiMesh Node) and setup AiMesh according to directions; which consequentially was really easy if you kinda know your way around a router interface.  Then I retested all the various sites using both devices.  The end result was smashing...BUT only for the 5ghz band.I saw significant improvement in throughput range and latency for 5 Ghz which would have been great were it the intended result (none of my IOT devices use the 5 Ghz band).  I didn't see much improvement on the 2.4 Ghz band even when the client device was very near to the AiMesh Node.  I made sure to try the Node in multiple locations both far and near to the original router which is a newer more powerful ASUS AC-3100.  Perhaps I could have had some different results if I involved customer service but I really didn't want to spend any more time than I already had.  So I returned the router.In my opinion this device performed similar to several range extenders that I have tried over the years as it relates to the 2.4 Ghz band.  I feel like you get a very modest improvement in range but it typically comes with a reduction in throughput  and latency.  I hope I am wrong and that someone with better knowledge or patience can identify why this is an anomaly.  I don't understand why 5 Ghz results seemed to indicate improvement so I'm reluctant to say that the result is likely.  Take that risk if you choose.  I owned an older version of the RT-AC66U and had nothing bad to say about it as a standard router many years ago.  This review is more about AiMesh I admit.  But it is a feature that ASUS is using to market a router that first came out almost a decade before this review so I think it important.
5,Before buying this router I bought a Netgear and a TP-Link which I had to return for different reasons. This was my third attempt at getting a good router and I could not be happier. Everything works the way it's supposed to. We use it for streaming and gaming mostly and no complaints.
5,This is the second of these I have purchased as nodes for my AiMesh WiFi system and it works flawlessly.  Setup is very particular but not really challenging — you just have to do all the steps in exactly the right order.  Using the ASUS router software set it up locally as a standalone wifi router and get it connected to the internet.  Update the firmware to the very latest version — this is critical.  Then tell the software that you want to use it as an AiMesh node.  The software will then reset it to factory default undoing all your setup work except the firmware upgrade; that's okay.  Get your primary router back on the internet and tell it to find a new node.  The software does the rest.  BE PATIENT.  It takes time to settle in but within a several minutes it will be humming along with as much speed as your internet service provider is likely to make available.  From that point you can administer your system from anywhere with the ASUS Router phone app.  In my case within a few minutes the new node had "stolen" devices from the other two units in the mesh meaning the AiMesh software determined that it offered the devices a better signal than they had previously.  Once it's set up you can unplug it and move it anywhere within range of your mesh as needed to eliminate dead zones.  I would not hesitate to buy another if I needed it.
2,I ordered this router because I only pay for 600 mbps from my ISP and I thought that this router could handle that. I also have the Asus AX3000 which I have been happy with but I thought may be overkill. The two routers were right next to each other each about 18 inches from my computer. I swapped the ethernet cable (connected to modem) from one router to the other going back and forth to compare the difference. The AX3000 delivered 550 mbps which is great and this one struggled to deliver ~120 mbps. I will be returning this router as it was much slower than advertised and I know this because I did a direct side-by-side comparison. If you want to get the most out of your internet my experience suggests that spending the extra money for the AX3000 is the way to go. I'm sure people have different experiences so as always - "your milage may vary".
5,i just noticed last month that i was not able to change router settings with optimum- i knew i use to be able to do so  i do not like that i cant control the router settings  this is why i purchased this router  and im very glad i didnot only can i change the settings i was looking to  but i can also add many many other options  firewall security usb drives guest networks and many other items.. another great thing is i can do this all from a smart phone "if needed"  i can also view anything from the phone that i have to quickly without loading the home system up to check it out - i can  now change channels and get away from all the other traffic of the area.. great router - great great range and super simple setup ..its been a short while with the new router !  still very pleased with it  love the phone app that i can view and  give access to or remove access - and this one i can connect  more items compared to the optimum junk router..as i write this i have 12 devices connected and not 1 single issue. with great results and waaaay better rangei also purchased my own modem - why pay optimum to rent one when u can own yours and keep your money ?GREAT purchase for me.
5,Love this router!! I got two more of the better model ones but this one is great! Especially if you only have a phone hotspot as your only Data access. You can tether a phone via USB using hotspot/tether data(will not work with "tether apps") as a WAN(Internet).It also has all kinds of options. I never thought a router made a big difference and I am a bit of a techie. I was wrong a good router is worth the cost. There are great 3rd party firmwares like Merlin etc that expand on it's versatility. If you are the kinda person that that always just bought a $20-30 Linksys router or something but have a network with shared storage and or multiple devices/PCs I highly recommend getting one of these or better yet the other ones I got (AC68U v2- the144mhz dual core CPU model aka AC1900p). The QOS and easy static device IP settings make it super easy to maximize bandwidth and the dual core 144mhz processor is more than enough to run an Open VPN directly on your router. This version would be pushing it depending on your setup.The Mesh AI mode makes extending your coverage easy and effective.
5,I replaced an older router with this one.  A user in an upstairs bedroom was having trouble getting a consistent signal.  With the new wifi 6 (I assume) she is now getting a good signal and no problems streaming like she was before.
1,Off the bat the unit never wanted to connect to my cable modem. I went through the usual steps of rebooting the modem and the WiFi unit rechecking settings but always getting the error message that there is something wrong with my internet connection. Should have sent it right back then but the other ASUS I purchased and returned to a local retailer said that there is a specific sequence to be followed and some older cable modems had issues. Yes my cable modem was more than 10 years old but the past 3 or so WiFi routers including an ASUS AC52U connected just fine and worked well for several years.I gave this latest purchased modem the benefit of the doubt. Since a cable modem replacement was in my near future I made a work around. I connected my old Linksys to the modem and fed the ASUS from one of it's router outputs for around four months. It worked just fine but I also noticed intermittent "Disconnected" error messages. Yes it could have been the the Linksys. But after the cable modem was replaced I removed the Linksys router and the intermittent "Disconnected" error messages continued to happen. In response to these message I would do a reboot of both the router and the cable modem. But then all of a sudden this third week of January 2020 the "Not connected" error message would not respond to a reboot and was now also displaying a "There is something wrong with the Internet connection". I thought the new cable modem might be failing but putting my Linksys back on the cable modem everything was just fine.The other weird thing is that even though the ASUS complained of being disconnected from the internet the status of the internet connection showed an active IP address lease. Also I noticed that while going back and for checking settings and the status that I would see it briefly show that it was successfully connected and then it would change its status back to "Disconnected".I searched the web and found a whole community of ASUS users complaining of the same weird problem it says it's disconnected but it shows a status of looking like it is connected. All said customer service was of no help which was not encouraging. Some people found a strange fix. They claimed that if you changed the DNS settings by adding them in manually with server addresses of other than your ISP's DNS servers that that would do the trick and you were magically connected again to the internet. In fact it was claimed that after you did this and you went back in and changed the DNS setting back to automatic (back to ISP DNS) that it would continue to stay connected. Needless to say I did this and not only did it not work but the web interface started locking up and acting erratic. It began kicking me out multiple times trying to log in after I had done any changes to the settings and doing a reboot.My conclusion is that the configuration has become corrupted which it is probably why I'm having these issues in the first place. I do not hold out any hope that restoring the configuration will help because it will likely happen again and again. I would guess that it would be due to hardware components failing which would take this to yet another level.It simply appears that the manufacturer has component and possibly design problems. The bottom line is that it is not worth the aggravation to continue to try and troubleshoot this.. I will not buy any ASUS Wifi routers any more.
5,I really like this Router. My TV used to buffer a lot when everyone in the house was vying for the internet. That problem was eliminated. I didn’t have to upgrade my internet service either. Yippee! I have internet through Cox & it’s basic speed with basic cable BTW.
4,THIS is a nice router. I had a $80 Netgear extender that was giving me problems.  So the IT guys at work told me about this model from Asus.  This unit functions so good I replaced my router AND dumped the extender.What a nice unit Asus makes.  I have a 4k TV an Oppo Udp-203 player a couple of HD TVs a PC and  2 iPhones plus a “guest net” setup for visitors.  It serves everything goin on without ANY issues or showing signal strength less than ALL bars anywhere in my house.I can stream video on the 5 GHz net while all the others use the 2.4 GHz nets FLAWLESSLY.  No buffering. No freezes or dropouts.Set up was easy fast and without any issues.Its plenty fast on all nets and simultaneous use of multiple devices is not a problem.Asus makes even faster routers. But this model works so good I didnt see need to spend any more than the $93 that I spent on this model.Maybe there are routers made by other manufacturers just as good out there - but I am completely satisfied with this one.My house is a 2 story with about 3k sq ft. Of living area. It serves up/downstairs from one end of the house to the other - without a hitch. Fantastic.This model also has many features I havent tried as yet. It gets firmware updates on its own - so I dont worry about keeping up with new security or bug updates.I recommend it for anyone wanting a router for similar use with similar house size.  No cons for it to date!
5,This router has by far the best wireless range on any commercial home router I have ever used. I have about 20 years experience as an IT guy.The router is truly plug and play for the most part. The range is the huge selling point of this router. I am not exaggerating when I say I can take a device and go a good quarter of a mile outside of my house and still have one to two bars of reception and getting pretty much the same speeds I am getting inside my house. There is one brick wall between me and the .25 mile. I absolutely love this router. I have seen posts on other products saying something like with product .... I can wireless connect 300 feet away to find later that I cant get devices to hold a good connection 100 feet away. Let me say that this ASUS router really reaches .25 mile or more outside my house through a brick wall.  I have a 2 acre yard and every spot is covered perfectly including down my driveway.Also the USB interface is great. I have lots digital movies on external hard drives and pictures. With downloading the ASUS support apps it will stream my movies and photos off the router (I did have to purchase a $3 recommended app as well). And even with the USB 2.0 interface loading times are next to none. Lightning fast. 3.0 even better.So far I have had this router for just over two months. I have only found one issue with it which 95% of people will not even consider it but I will mention it. If you plan to tether from USB to this device good luck. Although the interface is very very strait forward and even the tech support folks from ASUS  could not help me it just will not tether from USB no matter what we tried for hours (firmware updates and everything). However I was able to use my second cisco as a bridge and I am able to accomplish tethering without the USB so no complaints.Great product and well worth the price. Don't waste your money on a Cisco/Linksys/Netgear router that's range will make it about 1/3 of what this baby can cover. Trust me if you want a new router with crazy range and easy to set interface/controls this is for you.
5,Initially I'd selected WPA2/WPA3 personal and my Roku device kept buffering which it had never done before.  After several tries and changes including relocating the ASUS router I changed its security to just WPA2 personal and surprise surprise no more buffering problems.  So save yourself a lot of aggravation and configure with just WPA2 personal and not the WPA2/WPA3 option.
5,The ASUS RT-AC66U B1 AC1750 Dual-Band WiFi Router was listed as one of the best routers by PC Mag.com when I was looking to replace a 6 year old router that could not provide adequate WiFi coverage range without use of an extender. After less than a months use I am glad that it was purchased because it has successfully eliminated my issue of most concern which was lost of adequate WiFi coverage range resulting in drop outs and requiring use of a WiFi extender which was effective but not the total package desired which is to have the capability in ONE package not by using add ons. This router can provide WiFi coverage up to 3000 sqft which is totally adequate for our devices & home. It has a built in option of security monitoring that starts at the router protecting your downstream devices. It can support 30+ devices has parental control option guest device WiFi connection option and so much more for a quality built router at a very reasonable price.  ASUS technical support is outstanding & will help you setup your router out of the box if you desire. It is beyond worth the price.
5,easy to set up; i'm getting 60+ Mbps on my Win7 Pent 4 hyper-threading PC using the wireless 2.4GHz band with a 100 Mbps hook up from Spectrum. good for 1080 streaming on youtube.my TV Iphones and Amazon firestick all on wireless 5GHz.  none of the devices are far away but working smoothly and seamlessly.  Before the 6e wireless band is perfected this is the AC router to buy for under $100.00;  lots of features in the GUI that will be fun to explore in future such as guest network usb interface and VPN.Note: did not rate the "tech support" above because i had no need to contact however it is good idea to download the "User Guide" for which Amazon provides a Asus link down the page under "Technical Specifications".It does get a little warm on the middle bottom of it so put on a hot plate or nonflammable surface.  put mine on a screw on the wall. and one more thing it has 3 Antennas which seems better than the standard 2.  i wish there were replaceable in case of breakage but it does not look like they are.
2,I have a RT-AC66U as the primary router and a RT-AX3000 an AiMesg node. I wanted to add another AiMesh node. I picked AX1800S because it supports WiFi 6. Bought one but it did not work and tech support said the device was defective. Returned and bought another one still did not work. Tech support said this model has a compatibility issue. Returned again and bought another RT-AC66U and now everything works.
5,Excellent speeds for basic use. With 100Mbps Comcast service 2.4g speeds 40-60Mbps full BW (100Mbps) using 5g WiFi. Good signal at all extents of the home. Not sure about gaming (not tested). Setup not super easy but if you have prev experience you will have no issue.
4,Still have problems with spectrum tv with stopping
5,I bought the ASUS RT-AC66U B1 AC1750 Dual-Band WiFi Router based on the most current PC Magazine reviews of Wireless routers (July 2019).Setup was pretty straight forward. I renamed the router and the 2.4 and 5.0 Mhz frequencies the same as my old router in hopes that all of my devices would automatically connect to this new router.Everything connected except my smart TV's. After testing the near and far throughput of each frequency I found that the wireless throughput of the 5.0 freq was nearly as fast as my wired connection to the router (~200 Mbps). The 2.4 freq was around ~120 Mbps both near and far. I decided to connect the TV's via the 5.0 freq and everything else on the 2.4 including my 2 wireless video cameras. All wireless connections have stayed consistent  with no noticeable buffering after connecting with this router.I am very impressed with the administrative interface on this router. In the past I struggled to determine which devices were eating up bandwidth when I was having a significant amount of buffering on my TV's. This interface includes a menu in which you can monitor each devices bandwidth usage individually in a grid view. You can also view signal use by application.Updating the Trend Micro signature files and the router firmware was straight forward and trouble free.Overall I am extremely happy with the ASUS RT-AC66U B1 AC1750 Dual-Band WiFi Router. It is providing much faster throughput than my old 4 year old wireless router.
5,I am beyond impressed by this router. I have it downstream of a Motorola 7621 modem hooked up to WOW on the 500 Mbps plan. I am getting 400+ Mbps on the 5GHz band when I am standing by the router and 300+ in most areas of the house. I have it and the modem in a closet with a UPS so that I could run ethernet cables for VoIP. The 5GHz band is supported by the newer devices but the 2.4GHz band gives good speed to some of the older devices too. The ASUS Router app is by far the best feature though. After getting it set up I can monitor all the connected devices (real-time bandwidth) and set parental controls. The app's settings are very detailed and really help with security as well. Changing to OpenDNS or CloudFlare was quick. I have been using NordVPN on a few devices and this router will allow for whole-house VPN protection if I wanted to set it up that way. Owning my own equipment saves so much money compared to the monthly rental fees for inferior equipment.
5,I love this router so much I have 2 of them. I use one for my main router and the other as a mesh router to extend my network and hook up some devices to ethernet away from my main hub.The thing that sets it apart from my previous routers is the software. The router software comes with all you'd ever need to see everything happening on your network. I love being able to see everything connected and the amount of bandwidth they use over time. I've even caught the neighbors connecting other devices to my network after I was polite enough to lend them my password for a short time.The only downside is that the router needs rebooted routinely. The software won't connect over time and the whole things needs reset. I wish it would send an alert because the Traffic Analyzer will have gaps in data when the software went down.
1,When I was looking for a new wireless router I went out to do some research and found this router as one of the best budget routers from PC Mag. When I got it the box even had a sticker on it touting the recommendation. But since I have installed it it has been nothing but trouble.Basically the signal speed coming off the router was all over the place.  I have a 400Mbs plan. There were a couple times the first night that I got some good speeds off the router but basically the majority of time I couldn't get anything more than 170Mbs on the 5G network and nothing higher than 50Mbs off the 2G. I understand that the number of devices and location of the computer will affect and slow the speed but I was replacing my 6 year old single channel router with this one and was getting the same basic speeds. Additionally the speeds were really all over the place. My wife who is in a room 12 feet away from the router had speeds of 2-4Mbs. That's crazy low.I had the cable guy come out to check everything out and he ran a line out of the modem and got 470Mbs. As soon as he ran it out of the Asus router. It dropped to 150Mbs. This is not him standing next to the router this is him with a cable directly into the router.So basically the 5G channel is about as good as my 6 year old single channel router and the 2G channel is painfully slow. On 2G it takes like 15 - 20 seconds to load a mobile web page.  I have no idea what is going wrong but and this is the most frustrating thing I called up Asus to talk to someone and they are not accepting calls. I get that they can't be in the call center but I know personally that many call centers are still having their workers dialing in from home. But ok I can't talk to anyone in person but the message directs you to go to their website. So I did. And there's this button "Do you want to chat?" So I click on it and it brings me to a page that basically has a bunch of drop down menus that lead you to dumb FAQ pages that never help. The chat button kept popping up and so I kept hitting it thinking I was doing it wrong but it just kept sending me back to the same annoying unhelpful page.I usually don't leave bad reviews like this but I don't know what I am doing wrong. I usually trust PC Mag but this is just not working and right now it seems that there is no one at Asus that is able to help with anything.  So basically I'm returning the router getting my $92 back reinstalling my old router and avoiding Asus from now on.  I sincerely hope that your experience is better but I will take Asus and PC Mag's recommendations with a healthy grain of salt from now on.
5,The Asus RT-AC66U B1 (AC1750) offer solid range including good range on the 5Ghz band with excellent throughput especially with modern 802.11AC capable devices. The admin UI is reasonably well laid out and the router offers useful features for a device in this price category. Notably the device is easy to configure out-of-box but for those of us with more complicated home and soho networks (separate DHCP and DNS infrastructure routers switches and VPN infrastructure) this unit doesn't have any arbitrary silliness like functional limitations to routing tables forced use of 192.168.x.x /24 networks etc.. Other brands often gimp lower-end network products to force customers to a higher price-point thankfully Asus chose not to do that with this product. Overall for the price I can highly recommend this router/AP
4,Install and setup went well. Quickly updated firmware then updated again to use the Merlin firmware.The phone app is nice to have though I prefer going directly through a browser. All in all a good router I think. And it is DD-WRT compatible if I want to flash that at some point.As noted in other reviews these tend to run hot. Per the interface reading the cpu runs around 187 F/86 C plus/minus a few degrees and that is with the router upside down so heat can escape upward easily. That is too much heat for me so I bought some fans to cool it.These are the fans I went with:https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0721SYYTF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1As soon as I got the fans I plopped them down onto the vent and plugged them in. After 15 minutes of browsing I checked the temp - now down to a nice 147 F/64 C. I can live with that - hopefully the fans will last a while.
5,this product was very easy to setup and the speed is outstanding.
4,Was quick to install and configure after I figured out where to set the device up as an Access Point.  Overall the UI is decent but it could be improved to be a little more user friendly.  I bought this to replace my Apple AirPort Extreme since it is aging and tends to reboot multiple times per day now.  This one is supposed to work as an iTunes server and also a TimeMachine server.  I have not tried the iTunes server but reading testimonies on the web does not look promising for that.  I did try the TimeMachine server and it works although I have yet to put it through its paces by using it day in and day out.  I also wanted this router because of the ability to set the WiFi on a schedule to shut off at night.  I have yet to verify that it is really shutting off the radio at night but the SSID is not visible during that time so I assume it is.
5,This truly is a plug and play router. the only complicated part which is a lot easier for this one than other routers is to register it. I had a Netgear which was a royal pain in the ass. I sent it back. this Asus is far easier to set up and more powerful
3,Came home today 9/30/19 and no power to the router. I purchased this at the end of Nov 2018. Had power to everything else plugged in to the power strip/surge protector. Unplugged it from the strip and tried other outlets and still no power. Further fun ensues when I try to reach tech support during their business hours. Tried online chat and got a message that all reps were busy helping other customers and that I was #1 in the queue. Was hanging there for a good 8 minutes and decided F this because there's obviously no one available for chat and called them instead. I got someone (overseas) on the line right away but agent was useless. I told the cs agent my purchase date and other info and they proceeded with their scripted bs and had me do everything again (plug in reset etc.) even though it is (still) not powering on at all.  The cs agent kept stating (6 times!) that depending on where I purchased it I could get a refund if it was within the 30-day return policy. Hello! I just told you I bought it in Nov 2018 it's well past the 30-day return window! I finally had to tell the agent to stop saying that because it's well past the return window and they've now said that 6 times! *Facepalm* Now they want me to pay $15 in shipping so they can fix or replace my router even though I'm under warranty and they have no brick and mortar service centers or authorized repair centers that I could take it to. ZERO STARS ASUS ZERO STARS!! Never giving ASUS my business again!!
5,I did a lot of research before buying this router.  One of the factors in my decision was that in a J.D. Power customer satisfaction survey with routers dated 1/6/16 Asus was the highest rated company.  Another factor was the basic cost/benefit ratio of this unit compared to many other more expensive routers.  You can pay a lot more for a router but I don't think you will find a faster router than this one.I have a fiber optic cable connection that has a maximum speed of 1 Gbps so I tested the the router by comparing the Internet download and upload speeds of the wired connection to the router speed.  There was less than a 5% reduction from the cable speed when using the Asus router.  I don't think any router would do better than that.I will add two notes about Asus as a company.1)  Even before they entered the desktop and laptop markest very successfully they gained a reputation for technical excellence by making outstanding motherboards that were used in many top computers.  I also have had an Asus laptop for almost 4 years and have been very satisfied with it.2)  One benefit of buying from Asus is that they have technical support available 24/7.  I called them to get some assistance with a minor issue during setup and they spoke excellent English and were very helpful.In summary I have an extremely fast wireless speed using this this product and have had no issues with it so I strongly recommend it.
4,I bought a refurbished unit and it was not working well with an older Dell Inspiron laptop;  the connection would drop often at times the laptop could not connect at all to the Internet - a very frustrating experience.I called the phone number furnished when one clicks on the "Get Product Support" button.They worked with me patiently for more than an hour as I switched laptops trying to connect to the router all the while trying to conference in the ASUS technical support.  Once the ASUS technician was conferenced in a few short minutes he guided me to change the configurations of the router.After that my problems with the old Dell Inspiron went away and I am pleased with the performance of the device.
4,Update to 10/8/2018 Review:  The AI Mesh system continued to have strange disconnection issues.  I removed the 2 Mesh routers and added then as repeaters using the 5Ghz radio for the connection.  All problems are gone.  These are great routers but I think the AI Mesh system needs a bit more work.I have been using this router for years with AIProtection enabled and QOS.  It was rock solid.  When I decided to add two AIMesh nodes I ran into reliability issues.  My Mesh system consisted of three RT-AC66U B1 routers with one as the main router and the other two as Mesh nodes. The wifi network would disconnect randomly and I would lose connection to local resources.  I also noticed that the main router was very hot.  I updated the firmware and reset the config but that did not help.  Asus tech was not helpful.  Anyway the mobile app showed that the CPU and RAM usage was extremely high.  I disabled AIPRotection and QOS and resource usage dropped and the system started working reliably.  I do not think this model has the  power to run all the Asus services when in AIMesh is enabled.
5,Works great amazing purchase
4,Setting up the AC66U-B1 was fairly easy.  It has been running smooth now for over 2 months.  Updates to this router has been easy and without issues.  The only thing that I have noticed is that the 5 ghz WiFi signal will drop from time to time.  I have yet to do a hard restart but the router seems to correct itself within 10-20 minutes.  Hopefully this will not become a bigger issue in the future.  It covers my whole house front and backyard without issue.  My house is about 1400 sq ft and my yards add an additional 2100 sq ft of space.  For a majority of the time I am getting my full 200Mbs via 5 ghz WiFi and about 80Mbs via 2.4.  Will try it with a VPN in the future.
5,Just got this today and it works awesome! I also bought a Netgear R6700v2 last week as well to test the 2 out. My main goal was to have a router that covers over 2000 Square feet and also supported VPN services like IPVanish for my use of Kodi. The netgear worked great and speed was awesome but the firmware left much to be desired and no VPN access without flashing to DD-WRT which for the R6700 is not a option nor is Tomato. I got this one installed today and have been doing all my tests and this is a big upgrade from the normal AC66U  This is the B1 version and has brand new hardware on it and is basically a AC68U with a slight tweak of one radio ID. This Asus router also comes with a lot better firmware right out of the box but I updated right away online to the most current which was released yesterday on 6/22/2017.  This firmware has a lot more options for customization and etc. The best part is that I can connect to my IPVanish VPN service directly through this firmware without having to flash to DD-WRT or Tomato which for most people who know flashing can be a long process and comes with the possibility of it not working and bricking your device. The fact that I can do this VPN service right from the Asus firmware is a HUGE advantage over the Netgear! My wifi speeds are awesome and the device isn't as big and the lights are as bright as the Netgear which for me is nice! Ill review again in a few months to let everyone know how its doing after the break In period!
3,My main reason for purchasing this router was so I could set it up as a VPN client to protect all the WiFi devices in my home. ASUS website has great videos on how to do this but all depend on using the web interface on the router. That interface does not work with any Macintosh web browser. I tried Safari Chrome and Foxfire. I could not get the interface to work with any of them. You can’t set the VPN up using there tablet/phone app either. When I plugged my work Windows based laptop in everything worked just like the videos showed. Set up was then easy. But why would you build a web interface that doesn’t work well with all web browsers? In the end it is a good router I just wish I hadn’t  spent an hour of my time trying to get the interface to work.
3,Easy to set up very good coverage in 3000 sq ft 2 story house. But it failed suddenly after 1 year.  Tech support from Asus was excellent but unable to fix it remotely. I had to pay to ship it for repair which was "not solvable by replacing parts". I received a new replacement router within 3 days.  But by then I had had to buy another router.
5,This replaced a 12 year old router which finally gave up the ghost.  It worked perfectly out of the box no adjustments were required -- I'm very pleased with it.  I bought it because of the good reviews and was not disappointed.
5,I have had many ASUS routers throughout the years and this one is the best. Wi-Fi 6 is fast very easy to setup with app. The app is very user friendly and you can remotely monitor your router with your phone. The price is also very reasonable
4,The ASUS RT-AC66U name really encompasses several versions of hardware. I purchased the RT-AC66U B1 version for the specific purpose of running a FTP server on my wired network to receive images from a piece of hardware and then allowing  several Windows machines to access the images wirelessly using samba file-sharing. (My network uses pfsense for routing and firewall).The main advantage of this consumer router is that it is very friendly to other open source firmware options like Merlin and Tomato. I thought that if the stock firmware had issues the open source would likely be helpful and I was right.The router required updating to run the latest stock firmware. Unfortunately the stock firmware samba version was quite old (Samba3.0.xx I think) and my Windows 8.1 and 10 machines could not see the share even when re-enabling SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support in "Windows Features." Loading Asuswrt-Merlin open source software (same firmware as used in the ASUS RT-AC68U) from their Mirror 1 (main download site was corrupted) allowed for use of SMBv1 + SMBv2 and now my Windows 10 and 8.1 machines can see the share just fine. I am happy. Hope this helps someone.
4,If you're looking for something better than an ISP rental router but only need to handle 5 or 6 devices over a small area this if for you!I have a AC3100RT AC1900P and AC68U setup as a wired Ai-Mesh but I wanted to reduce reliance on WiFi for my Living Room setup that includes several devices with ethernet ports; this AC66U is being used as a wireless bridge so I can plug my media devices into ethernet and for that purpose it works acceptably.ASUS makes great hardware and their Ai-Mesh software works great. Highly recommend.
3,Doesn't have anywhere near the range advertised. Of course that seems to be true of just about all the WiFi routers on the market. The only thing worse are the repeaters on the market that feed off this deficiency.
5,We were having a lot of problems with our home Wi-Fi and over time they seemed to get worse. The Belkin Dual Band 802.11n router had once given us plenty of speed but now our signal was weak slow and often disappeared. We tried a variety of solutions testing the modem moving the router all that jazz. Nothing worked. Additionally though our house is small (2000 sq. ft.) it’s almost 100 years old and not built from materials amenable to wireless.Then I noticed that the detectable Wi-Fi networks surrounding our house had quadrupled since we’d bought the Belkin. The neighbors had all added wireless or upgraded their routers. We were getting signal interference from all sides.We were also demanding much more from our wireless partially duet or cutting cable and switching to Roku and Amazon Fire stick both over Wi-Fi.The Asus has solved most of our woes. Faster more reliable speeds. Wider range.It was easy to setup and maintain. The footprint is bigger and the antennae make it more visible on thee shelf but it’s a worthwhile trade off for WiFi that almost always works well.There are occasional signal losses and bottlenecks but far less frequent than before. I’m more convinced than ever those are cable Internet issues.
5,My netgear N450 combo cable modem and wireless router was constantly losing the connection with authentication errors.  Got that replaced under warranty and within a week the new one was also having the same problem.  So I shut off the wireless part of the N450 and got this asus to handle the router duties.  So far (2 weeks of use) it has never failed to connect and to maintain the connection.  Has excellent throughput higher than the N450 did.  Seems to work better with my smart Samsung TV too.  With the dual band I've been connecting everything on the 5G band with no problems.. 5G has way more channels than the 2.4G band but supposedly has less range.  So far range has not been a problem.Setup seemed pretty straightforward but some of the nomenclature used on the Quick Start Guide didn't really match what the setup screens showed/asked for.  I've been thru this drill before so not a problem but I can imagine a newbie might wonder if they are doing it right and what to do next.The lights are on top and they way I have things arranged I can't see them easily.  Wish they had put them on the front edge so they were visible from both top and front.. it would have been easy to do so.
4,I had the router working pretty quickly. In order to get my Tivo to work correctly (so it was getting the programming from the internet) I called Asus support. After explaining my issue the person said the tech would need to call me. I gave the tech control of my computer and he began doing some things. After some of it was done he asked if I had optimized my old router. ("No") He said in order for the Tivo and other wifi items to work right I needed to optimize my router. " Now the charge for that is $109.99". (I didn't know how to optimize the router).  He installed C Cleaner Prof. Maybe get this program or similar before buying a new router. It may save you some $$. The router is extremely  fast. The wifi download speed was equal or better than a direct ethernet wire. (155Mbps! on Comcast)
5,A much better WIFI signal than the router provided by the ISP.  The security function provided by Trend Micro recommended several settings that were turned on by default  and needed to be turned off for better security - WPS and universal plug and play (UPNP). Since I had already turned these off I just got an acknowledgement. This is good. WPS by specification can never be made secure. UPNP is inherently insecure. This router has 3 guest accounts on both 2.4 & 5 GHz which provides good flexibility. The diverse guest accounts allow me to segregate internet of things (IOT) from each other and from my household network -- really good for security. The user interface on the control panel was better than most. A nice router..
1,I have a gig Fios connection wanted to replace VZ router to avoid paying lease.So I bought the ASUS RT ax1800.Pros: nice app ease of configuration IPsec VPN Servers nice features overall.Cons:The upload speed is chopped.Compare to the VZ routerI get 800mbs down / 600mbs up on wired connection compare to 900mbs down / 880 mbs up on VZ router and only 300mbs down /170mbs up on wifi 6 5G compare to 650mbs  down / 580 up VZ routerTest are consistant with both iPhone 13 Pro Max and M1 MacBook AirWorks better on AP mode as I get 550mbs up and down on wifi6Tried a lot of setting and tunings suggested by tech support still same problem.Disappointing Tech support.Returning
1,First - some background.  I'm a retired network architect/engineer so I've been around tons of routers.Now - for the details - This product was not designed for me.  If you'r a mechanic plumber or other non-IT tech than this might be for you.  I on the other hand wanted to customize the router's configuration to fit into my extensive home network.First thing I did was go internet snooping for a user/reference manual. None found.  Next I called ASUS tech support and asked them about a manual.  After almost an hour of "I can't find its etc."  I asked for the call to be escalated. I was told someone would call me within the hour.That was Thursday noon.  It's now Saturday AM I have returned the router to Amazon for credit and still have not heard back from ASUS nor do I ever expect to.Don't get me wrong I'm not anti ASUS.  I have used an ASUS AC1200 router for my home network (as the first hop from the ISP's router.  My experiences with that product its thorough manual quality led me to select this WIFI 6 router.  Boy was I wrong.  ASUS routers are no longer on my preferred. list.
5,Ive been a Asus fan for a long time which I always use the motherboards and other components in all my PC builds.  Decided to give a Asus Router a try and see how it is.  So far the signal is very good on the 5G connection giving me full bars down into my basement and across the home.  Approx 1200 Sq Ft.  The one configuration setting I needed to make in order to get full HSIA speed via Wifi and Ethernet was to enable Jumbo Packets.  Once that was enabled everything was good to go.  The latest Firmware was applied to the router already which was a plus.  If looking for a simple user interface and a router to get the job done this will do.
5,We needed a new router as our last one was just not up to the current level of devices.  This one was super easy to set up and has a strong signal throughout our house.
5,I returned a new (similar price) Netgear router for this one and am very pleased with the ease of use and speed. My IT experience is limited so I can only compare these two. The Netgear router dropped a 540 Mbps wired connection down to 38 Mbps over wireless even after an 1 1/2 hour call to tech support (at a range of 2 feet.) This one drops the wireless speed down to around 350 but is sometimes full speed. The speed does often drop though compared to wired so 4 stars on the WiFi.  I didn't get as far as setting up guest accounts on the netgear router because the speed was unacceptable. On this one the set up was very easy. There are 6 separate guest accounts available (3 on 2.4 GHz and 3 on 5 GHz.) I did not rate tech Support because I did not need them.
5,Paid a little more than I wanted to for a router but seeing the reviews online I wanted to get something that is reliable and trustworthy and not something cheap and troublesome.It works great gives a stable connection. I'm working from home and it is all online based; have not had issues with working at all. Very functional with all its ports like to connect a phone. I like the 2 channels it has I put all my smart gadgets on 2.4 ghz and phones laptops on the 5ghz.I had to restart it a couple of times but they send updates for it so gives me a peace of mind that they may be addressing the glitches or whatever.
4,After reading several articles about Wifi routers I decided to get the ASUS AC1750.  This works great.  It allows you to have a main Wifi link and then temporary Wifi links (for guests).  I have this in a closet.  The 2.5Ghz signal will travel a good distance with about 80GB download speed.  The 5Ghz signal does not go as far.  It only goes about 20-30 feet (probably because it's in a closet).  All in all I'm currently happy with the ease of setup speed and availability of the signal.  If something changes I'll be sure to update this review.  I can recommend this product.
5,So I've used Xfinity for 8 years and pay for the 200 mbps plan but rarely (if ever) get those kinds of speeds. I was getting an abysmal 5.2 mbps in the furthest room from the xfinity Gateway router (which is not far I live in a small apartment) which was seriously messing with my partner's work meetings. With this router I'm getting over 230 mbps nearly everywhere in the house and where I was getting 5.2 mbps before I am now getting 130. This thing rocks! Set up was pretty easy but if you have the xfinity gateway (it's a modem/router combo) make sure you go online and enable bridge mode before you go through with the router set up but after that it's super easy! 11/10 would recomment
5,This router/access point should provide plenty of adjustability for any home user; I just wish that some features weren't tied to Trend micro services (some free some for a fee).  If you want to be free of that and get even more tweaking options it supports alternative software (downloadable off the web).  I've had to reboot it only once and that wasn't because it wasn't routing and wifi-ing but because I couldn't connect to the management interface.Security features include all the basics wifi speed was better than I got with my ISP's access point range is plenty for our house.  Extras like network storage (attached to a USB port) and VPN are handy features that also make it superior to anything your ISP may rent you.It's been running for several months now and I'm happy with the purchase.
5,This router replaced a previous ASUS router that was showing signs of age after six years. The new router is giving me far more powerful signals than the previous router ever did. It covers my 1800 square foot (167 square meter) apartment quite handily.Setup was quite easy. I simply waited until late night (when nobody was watching TV or going on line) and swapped out the old router connecting the same cables to the new router. The administrative interface was simple and familiar. I took advantage of the new features to set up a guest network as well as programming the main network with the same SSID as the previous router. All my WiFi devices connected to the new router without problems.I am very happy with ASUS prodcuts.
5,This ASUS wifi router worked out of the box without any firmware update or replacements to take my Warp ZTE Connect wifi hotspot (4G with Sprint unlimited plan) and it plugs into the USB in the back of the wifi router. I connected to the router wirelessly went through the setup wizard went to the USB device setup told it to do automatic gave it the login/pass info and it now serves out my wifi hotspot 4G connection over the whole network. So now all my computers phones and tablets connect to the WiFi router's network and have the same access to the 4G internet coming in from the USB hot spot Warp Connect with a way stronger signal stable and much better sharing while having a file sharing network on top of it. Fantastic!
5,I have IP cameras at my house connected to my old router and because of a lack of router VPN support I was forced to use port forwarding in order to view the cameras remotely.  This was a huge mistake because my router was subject to constant hacking attempts that would disrupt my internet service and once even hacked into my cameras.  In order to remove this threat I ordered this router because of its built in VPN server capabilities using OpenVpn.  It also has a built in DDNS service for free (this is great because most often this is a monthly paid for service almost anywhere else).  Now I can VPN remotely into my router and turn off port forwarding to greatly reduce my chances of another hack.  The USB 3.0 port is also great because I use it to connect an external hard drive to backup the computers on my home network.  Wifi signal strength is also very strong throughout my entire house and now my home internet connections stays on all the time with no more interruptions in service!  Great router highly recommend!
5,Just got it running. Worked great until I tried to login to the router. I had the user name backwards. I tried to reset to factory default but it wouldn't go. Then flipped the name and it worked.Wifi is good. Our kitchen PC used a AC line because of poor Wif.  WIth the Asus Wifi D/L was 2x faster than the AC line at 31MB/sec.I was dreading having to reserve a DHCP ID for my network printer but after I set the IP to 192.168.1 instead of the default 192.168.50 the printer was assigned its old ID. I dunno how that happened.Thanks Asus. All you gotta do now is work for 7 years like my old Dlink 645
5,ASUS Dual-Band 3 x 3 AC1750 Wi-Fi 4-Port Gigabit Router (RT-AC66U_B1)        I purchased this router RT-AC66U B1 and it is great.Many people have written bad reviews and I am assuming they got the less costly version without the B1 after the model number.  The old model supposedly had some issue with the power button and does not come with the added Trendmicro Ai security.But this version has the Trendmicro Ai security. So far works great. I have had it setup and running two days.  This model was more expensive than the version without B1 in model name.  Also because of some bad reviews I did buy the 2 year extended service warranty offered by Amazon.As of this time it is a great router and easy to set-up and configure. The only thing that does not work as I would like is the url and keyword filter but this is a known problem with filtering some webpages as the router instructions say it cannot filter any secure website that use compression or https; although it will filter pages that have only http.I also set the dns to opendns servers and that filters out most porn and malware.
5,This is my 2nd ASUS wifi router for another property (my 1st one was RT-AC68U and has been working for 3 yrs). Just like RT-AC68U besides high wireless access speed and large coverage RT-AC66U also supports remote management VPN for LAN-like access through mobile network scheduler of automatically reboot weekly. Always showing attached devices with correct device names and ip address. My previous Netgear wifi router frequently did not show device name and ip address for some devices randomly which caused these devices could not be accessed through public network (e.g. IP cameras not able to access via mobile apps.). This is one of the major reasons that made me decided to replace the Netgear wifi router.So far I am very satisfied with ASUS RT-AC68U/66U series wifi routers.
4,Solid router that doesn't take up a lot of room real dim blue lights on the front bezel so not bright and distracting at night.  Firmware/interface is OK - I wish this router had a feature to automatically connect a device to either AC or G so that you ultimately only have one SSID being broadcast  - similar to Smart Connect on Netgear routers.That said this replaced a fairly modern Netgear Nighthawk router that was pretty much junk.  This one just works.Compatible with Mesh too so you are future proofed with this model.  I would recommend it for most people.
5,When my old Netgear router failed I research online for a good value for a good AC router.  I did not want to spend a lot of money for a router so after reading a lot of reviews on routers I settled for the  ASUS Dual Band Gigabit WiFi Router (AC1750) Model (RT-AC66U B1).  I just received it and installation was easy  almost plug and play  All I had to do is change the default password and I was up and running.  I have about 12 devices connected to this router wirelessly and my speedtest results are fantastic.  Wirelessly on all my devices I can get speeds almost the same as being hardwired to the router.  As a test I setup 7 streaming videos running at the same time with no buffering problems at all.I cannot say how durable this router will be over time but I am really impressed with its performance right out of the box.I will write an update after running this router for a while.So far a great little router.
4,My family is using Comcast and my plan as 1TB monthly data limit which we have been crossing last couple of months. I need to know who's using all the data. ASUS RT-AC66U B1 could easily show me which device is using how much data. I think it's the best router under $100 to achieve that. I used the built-in firmware and didn't have to install anything. I considered Netgear routers but I wasn't sure if it can do what I want without installing a third-party firmware.One downside compared to my previous router TP-Link Deco M5 are the Asus app is less visually attractive and more cumbersome to manage parental control.
5,A very cost effective wifi router if you want or need the performance and features  This device is far and away the best consumer quality router I have ever used or purchased and as professional in the field I have used many.  I bought this one as an upgrade to the older N version which i now have configured as a repeater to extend my coverage well into my yard  This one has significantly better throughput and produces a much stronger signal throughout my home especially on the 5G band.  It is definately a worthwhile upgrade.I use many of the features of the router and all are easily configured and reliable.  I have an attached USB 3T drive for use as NAS as well as media streaming and personal cloud access.  I also use the VPN feature to insure securtiy when i am on a public network but need to be sure my activity is encrypted as well as to access devices on my home network from remote locations.  The AiCloud and AiProtection (Trend Micro)  work as advertised and are also easy to enable and configure.
5,This router has been great.  Setup was a snap. Transfer speeds are very fast. Connectivity is flawless.setup: I didn't really have to do much aside from naming my wifi network and creating a password. It took less than 5 minutes.speeds: I use a home network and I'm constantly transferring music videos pictures etc between my phones computers tablets etc.  This router has made those file transfers much much faster - not to mention my wifi internet speeds.  I can stream and download movies perfectlyconnectivity: When I walk into my house my phone connects and stays connected.  Period.  No drops no spikes no lag no random reconnects.  This thing is very dependable.  It just worksside note:  I paired the router with the ASUS cable modem that was recommended to ensure compatibility and that seems to have been a good choice because everything has been working flawlessly since I bought the pair - I'd highly recommend you do the same.overall: 5 stars this device has been performed extremely well with no hassles.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.
3,Above average router but nothing outstanding or competitive. For the value I'll accept.Instruction booklet is outdated. To get access to configuration I Googled and found a specific link. There some nice features for blocking website tracking history etc.The area coverage of wifi signal is decent. Can reach in the backyard.Zero tech support.Crappy user interface.Ps. Save your precious time. Easy access to wifi on backside of router. Password is there.
5,Bought the first one back in 2017 still works very well. Recently I need a second node to support me have a better single when walking around the house so bought another one but used (marked as an acceptable condition) given the new ones are back-ordered.  The item came with the original opened box but the condition is pretty good I would say it's beyond what is marked it works well out of the box.The AIMesh feature is a must-have now my meeting won't cut off when I walk around from one room to another. Great work ASUS!!! That's why it's the best editor picked router.
5,When I was in my dining area the WiFi signal coming from my neighbor's house was stronger than my Frontier Fios signal 30 feet away. The weak signal caused loading delays every 15 seconds when streaming videos. Since the Frontier modem/router is a jerry-rigged mess I have to use it to feed the Asus. I turned off the WiFi on the Frontier furnished modem.My signal strength has now doubled using the Asus!I no longer get loading delays in streaming videos.The furnished instructions were easy to follow and I was on-line in a matter of minutes.
4,Mejoró la navegación comparado con el router de mi ISP lo compré en septiembre del 2020 y hasta ahora no ha tenido nigún problema se ha caido la señal un par de veces pero nada grave. Lo conecté a un puerto WAN del router de mi ISP y la instalacion fue muy facil. Lo unico por mejorar es la cobertura de la banda de 5Ghz pues es limitada
3,Overall I would say that this works alright as a 2GHz router. It cuts out occasionally and is finicky on occasion. But pretty standard problems that I have had with most routers. The 5 GHz is awful though. I can't rely on it for anything
5,Own 2 of these! Slightly different but basically same models first one was updated and cant see a difference other than a different digit on model#. The main obvious difference is that the newer one has dimmer flashing lights if installed in a bedroom. They have both been the most reliable longest wireless range routers Ive ever owned. Just flawlessly running with no hiccups.  Multiple people online and streaming all at once. To be fair we dont game online though so I cant speak to that.
5,Upgraded from an eight year old ASUS router that just wasn't robust enough when the pandemic happened and we had two adults working remotely and two kids schooling remotely.  This has worked great.  I was hoping that I could of just transferred over the programming and IP assignments from the old router to this but I was unable to do that.  No matter it was easy to program.  We've had it for 5 months now and it still is working great.  User interface is great.  Also there is a strong online presence of users that can answer questions if need be.
5,I've had Linksys NetGear TrendNet Amped and TP-Link routers all in the past 7 years.  I'll never buy anything other than an ASUS router again. Regular firmware updates means they are always improving their product.  You'll be lucky to get an update once a year if at all with the others mentioned.  I've never had a router with so much built in feedback from the web interface on a network and utilization.  Straight forward and easy to setup.  This RT-AC66U_B1 performs great too for under $100.  It's like I spent $350 like I have in the past on a router that let me down.  This is the best router initially I've ever set up.  Only time will tell if it remains the best to me.Update:Almost 6 months later and I installed an additional one at home for mesh support and replaced my work wifi routers with three of these two for ai mesh support.  Needless to say they all are working perfectly.
4,While changing the initial password the new password did not save . I was not able to login to change my settings later . Had to reset  the device . Password reset did not work again . Called customer care . The person tried few things and asked me to return the device . However I found a way out . After changing the password  go to router information -> about my router and update the password and press save . This will save it to the new password. I didn’t return the device —it’s working fine now
5,I hated my ATT Uverse wi-fi router because the speeds were inconsistent and not putting out the speeds I was paying for. So I heard everyone talking about ASUS routers and how well they work with ATT. So I turned ti wi-fi off on my ATT router and ran my connections through my ASUS router. I was able to get wi-fi connections from outside on my phone which before I couldn't even connect to my own network.I pay for 100mbps and I'm now getting around 112mbps on a consistent basis. That's money well spent if you ask me. I kept the same software on the router also along with buying a USB powered mini fan to always keep my router cool.I like the fact I can customize whatever setting I like but so far I'm haven't had to do any tweaking. Why tweak something if it's performing better than I expected. I will run my Uverse tv's connections through my router in the near future also but haven't gotten to that yet.
5,I read so many reviews of routers my head was hurting. Do I want the 1750 or 3500? 1 antenna or 6? So many questions but all I really wanted was my usual speed of 115+ mbps ability to choose between 2.4 and 5G no drop outs and ability to connect 10+ devices. This router does all that! I got it a few weeks ago maybe longer and after initial set up I haven't touched it since. No drop outs no random disconnecting or slow bouts all my families devices are working flawlessly and my speeds are 115+. I haven't even thought about it since I got it that's a good sign!Update: it has been over 3 years now (time flies) and I have literally never touched this router since I set it up. I am updating because I now have gigabit internet. This router gives me about 500mpbs on my cell with wifi and 960mbps on laptop with ethernet. It's a great little router and I'm going to buy another one to replace my netgear router from 2015!
5,upgraded to this router..love the features..aimesh ready..aicloud ready..router GUI is nice..pluged it in to my modem..setup popup..name your network set  a password..bingo
1,I have never ever had a problem with ASUS routers until this one. Setup was normal the wifi signal was strong but I was unable to login to the management console. I was setup in AP mode and I reset the router multiple times with different passwords for the Admin account thinking that was the problem. Nope. Nothing would pass the admin credentials. I returned the router and then later read someone asking about admin credentials in AP mode. Next time I would try setting up the router in normal router mode try to login and update the firmware? I am giving low marks to ASUS tech support as I could not find the bug list in any of their firmware revisions nor could I find a way to upgrade the firmware without the admin login.
5,Replaced my old old Linksys router.  Chose Asus since it was one of the least risky routers mentioned about security...access admin page with 192.168.50.1 instead of the usual 192.168.1.1..can update firmware easily with single click..2.4GHz and 5GHz can have separate SSID's..both can disable SSID broadcast..both can have separate passwords..both automatically chooses best channel selection (firestick can use 5GHz)..both can have MAC filtering..gets warm but not hot..light enough to hang on wall with two push pinsWish..longer admin password capability..use ch.100-144 (just sitting there not being able to use in the U.S.)
5,We have a 1300 square foot house. The ASUS AC-3100 router just wasn't reaching the backyard with the router at the front of the house. With the addition of the AC1750 at the rear of the house it creates a seamless mesh network with no more dropouts. I actually noticed speed increases on my TVs because they have a stronger signal to load content. I wish I would have done this sooner.
4,The WiFi speed wasn’t as fast as expected at. 10 foot range but MUCH fasted than my previous Asus RT66. The interface is almost the same as the RT66 which isn’t the easiest to master but default settings will work for most. Lots of features but seems to lack power settings of older versions.
5,My apartment provides Ethernet ports so I needed a router. I bought it because of the brand ASUS and I am happy it is working great so far. The 2.4-GHz band is weirdly slow when I first tried it but the 5-GHz one works great! I don’t need 2.4 GHz for my devices so I never tested it again after installation and it could be just a one-time thing. The size is pretty big though but it doesn’t look too bad. I love it because it does the job and provides reliable high-speed wireless connection.
4,I replaced a router that I bought 3 years ago that required an extender to (sort of) cover the whole house. I’m very happy with the performance of the Asus. I’ve set up a few routers over the years so I got thru the setup after some head scratching. The the instructions both in the manual and online are a little sketchy thus minus one star.
5,Really great router. I am able to track daily data use and compare to Cox cables data usage. Good coverage. Zero tech support though. Can’t even reach anyone with questions. Just some lame posting on their web site about Unable to provide support due to Covid-19. You know this is fake. If programmers waitresses and everyone else can find a way to work you know that ASUS tech people can as well. Bad way to save a buck. Luckily I did not have any major problems with installation and interface.
5,Overall very happy with this router.  Very good range and data transfer speeds.  Fairly easy to set up except that when I attempted to reset router using the reset button it wouldn't do it.  If you have the same problem do a web search for a "hard reset" for Asus routers and you will find a procedure that works.
5,Wow. Networking has always given me a headache but this router is absolutely fantastic. Easy to setup even easier to configure.User interface on this is great you can configure everything from WiFi passwords to your own VPN. Not enough control? There’s even a mobile app that you can use to keep an eye on your network while on the go.Signal strength is good but a larger house might experience some dead spots. ASUS does have a WiFi Mesh feature to address this problem though I have not played around with it personally.
5,Fantastic router for the money. Great signal that reaches all around a reasonably large home. Obviously works very fast and is practically a “switch” when you hook your computer up directly to it. Also the Asus interface is quite user friendly for anyone who wishes to customize it a little bit as I have done... really no need to “flash” it unless you’re doing something really intensive.
5,Works well. Good device for small home network. Will recommend for anybody who wants to take control of your network.
5,I've been dealing with tech for 30 years.  I'm that kid that's everyone's tech support.  As I grew up I realized it was a waste of my time and I tried to get people to stop calling me but so many just won't stop so I need to issue equipment that's problem free.  So far this thing has been damn good and hasn't given me any problems.  Good strong signal that's reliable and predictable.  In service 24-7 and no failures on a few of them after many months.
5,A stable feature-rich router at a decent price. This RT-AC66U_B1 version is very different from the non B1 version. The B1 has essentially the same CPU and main-board as the very powerful RT-AC68U except with slightly slower radios (AC1750 vs AC1900). At only $110 you are getting 90% of the same internals as ASUS' top-of-the-line $140 router.The factory firmware is pretty powerful on its own but if you want even more features and the ability to highly customize your settings you can load the awesome 3rd party Merlin firmware to get most of the functionality DD-WRT offers on other routers. This router runs warm not hot like so many others which tells me there's a quality heat sink installed and so far it it has been very stable.This is pretty inconsequential but I initially thought the router had a cheesy painted crisscross pattern on top. This is not the case; it's actually texturing in the plastic that makes the design—no cheap paint or stick-on decals which is nice.
3,Asus overall had not let me down until I bought this router. Every now and then we’d get disconnected and have to wait a bit for it to reconnect. At first we had thought it was an issue with our service provider but soon found out it was actually the router itself. We have internet speeds of 400+ mbps and the router slowed it down to 170-200. Already sent the router back to Asus to have it replaced for round 2 but for now I’m keeping the review at 3. Would have been 1 had not been for the awesome customer support I was given when I called concerning this issue.
5,I bought this because it was on a list of recommended routers on my VPN service provider's website.  I wanted to set up a VPN on the router so that all of my device traffic is encrypted over a VPN connection.  Very easy setup if your VPN service provider uses the OPEN VPN standard.  It includes a very nice firewall and anti-malware features.  It is a very good AC wireless router.  Great for the price.
5,Great router. While it isn’t the latest technology as of 2021 it is a very reliable model which has a very large user community. It runs ASUSwrt software which has options and features other routers may lack. For example I can connect my mobile phone to the USB port and enable USB tethering to share internet connection with the entire local network.
5,Used it to replace an AC1900 Nighthawk which I was happy with but died.  The first thing I did was connect my desktop and download a large game from steam.  My old router would normally download at around 15-20MB/s.  This one was averaging 30MB/s over a 15 minute period.  Much faster!After using this for over a month I have had zero issues.  I have 3 TVs an Xbox PS4 3 PCd and usually 4 phones connected at one time normally and not the slightest hiccup.
5,bought it to replace the Google wifi  whole home mesh when it started to flake after a couple months.  It works great to cover both floors.  The coverage is as good or better in some cases.User interface is good only gripe I have is you have to set port forwarding per ip. This is a pain when everything is dhcp with no static routes. By Mac or host name would be a nice option.
5,This router is fabulous! I thought I was going to have to invest in a mesh type for $300+ but we decided to try this one first. It meets our needs perfectly. We're in a typical planned community single story all drywall walls about 2600 square feet and FINALLY every inch is receiving the wi fi signal. I'm sitting in the old dead spot at our dining room table where I couldn't get a signal before and its at full strength as I type this. We have over a dozen devices using the wi fi at any given time and no lag at all.  It is mounted on the wall. This router has the necessary port to run a cable to the printer and set it up as a network printer. This way we only need one printer for the household. Very happy with this purchase!
5,After noticing my old router was not performing up to expectations I did some research and decided on this one as a replacement.  I consider myself of moderate skill level with tech I have set up 5 or 6 routers in the past and there always seems to be a hitch in the setup that makes it frustrating. I am happy to say this router was out of the box set up and sending out signal in under 15 minutes. The online interface is easy to use and as detailed as you would want  it. Very happy with this product!
5,Easy to set up and install.  Had no issues connecting Roku devices computers hand held games gaming sets or phones.  Usually have 2 computers (1 gaming) 2 phones and one streaming device running simultaneously with no lag time.  Some devices are located in other rooms around corners and down hallways...never an issue with connectivity.  Great purchase!
5,I had to upgrade my t-link wifi because I was going to install a video surveilance system of 16 cameras that works with wifi.  I also had some trouble conecting my Mac equipment to the old wifi.  The ASUS dual band was the result of my research and up to now it is working properly.  No more trouble with connecting Mac products and no problem with 8 cameras so far.I thought that the dual band would be an advantage but it turn out that 5G equipments are still rare.  Surveillance Cameras were 2.4G. ROKU is 2.4G. Samsung Cell phones (J type) are 2.4G.  So I am only using the 5G with my iPads my MacBook Pro and one Samsung Galaxy 3G.  The rest is all in the 2.4G band.However the equipment works very well in a brick and mortar 3 storied house.
3,This router drove me crazy.  It is easy to use and everything is fine until 24 hours later the CPU is maxing at 100%.  I tried rebooting it unplugging the power plugging it back in etc and nothing seemed to help.  I checked to ensure I had the latest firmware but couldn't figure it out. Tech Support was worthless and even the usual message boards were no help.  Then it occurred to me - the router was set to renew the IP addresses every 24 hours. I set that time to a week (I dont have 255 different devices connect in a week) then I set it to automatically reboot every every night - now it works fine and handles traffic without an issue.
4,Using the stock firmware I am able to successfully use a VPN provider within the router. The speed however is affected quite a bit. The average speed being roughly around 25/30mbs. Don't expect faster than that with this. I do recommend using "TCP" instead of "UDP" for a little better speed and performance stability for the VPN. The interface itself is very well detailed and straight forward.
5,I purchased this to replace an older Netgear router.  In my old setup I also had a TP-Link RE450 range extender to improve signal quality in our great room and 1st floor master bedroom.  Since installing the Asus RT-AC66U-B1 router I have been able to remove the range extender since signal quality seems pretty good throughout the entire house (about 2100 sf).  I've had the router about a month now and so far I am very pleased with its performance. Setup was a bit tricky for me but I have some Ethernet connected printers with static IP addresses.  The new router uses a different address scheme than my previous Netgear router so I had to change the printer settings for it to work with the Asus router.  It just took me a little longer to sort it all out but everything is working fine now.
5,Big improvement over our older Asus router that was 5 years old.  Newer technology and upgraded RAM/CPU has made this thing a workhorse for all us being at home.  No drops strong signal and great price.  Out of the box not all ports were 1gig had to call tech support and they helped fix it via some weird setting and firmware update.  Other than that no issues.
2,Installed easily and worked very well out of the box. Strong signal around the house and basement (concrete) and worked well...until it died. Lights out. Called ASUS support totally wasted 45 minutes of my life getting nowhere. In the end they wanted me to ship it back to them and wait "7-10 days" for a repair. Really? I guess I just don't need a network for a couple weeks. Nobody really thinks you can send a router off to a huge repair center and get it back in 10 days do they? They would not send me a replacement up front and they wanted me to pay for shipping it back to them. TOTAL B.S!! I started looking for another router and I noticed a "Support" option from Amazon linked to the original order. Nothing to lose I "asked" support to give me a call via clicking the support/call me now button on the screen. Took under a minute and literally five minutes later the tech had a replacement headed my way and a pre-paid return label in my email. All that took less time than it took the first Asus rep to find me a supervisor. ASUS TAKE NOTICE!! THIS IS WHAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT/SERVICE LOOKS LIKE!! I can forgive Asus for a bad apple Wi-Fi router but even the "Supervisor" I talked to would not budge. Fingers crossed the new one lasts. I have LOTS of Asus equipment never had a problem. Can't believe they won't replace a dead part up front. THANK YOU AMAZON for doing what Asus would not.
5,Bought this (ASUS RT-AC66U ) and the Arris surfboard SB6190. Somehow slightly faster download and upload than xfinity's default router when on the same plan. SUUPER easy to set up. The combo will pay for itself in 10 months which is what I wanted to accomplish. Super stable wifi through 2 stories/2000 square foot home. Router and modem located on 2nd floor towards front of home.
5,In this time of working from home we found it was time to upgrade to a stronger wifi signal. This ASUS covers our 2 story 3000 sqft home easily. No booster needed.  I run 2 TV's with Roku on the 5GHz band and computers and phones on the 2.4GHz band and haven't experienced any Zoom video buffering or poor connectivity. Worth it.
5,Bought this Asus router to replace my older Asus router which died after 7 or 8 years. This new one has better range better more secure connections higher bandwidth. It handles all the connections well and there are plenty. The browser settings GUI is very comprehensive and organized  though i haven't gone to far into the customization of settings but when i have it's usually with a trusty youtube video and specific instructions.
2,Out of the box the router would  arbitrarily resolve https:// requests to http:// resulting in an access denied error message from random websites. I attempted to resolve the problem by doing a factory reset then strictly adhering to the setup instructions from ASUS with the same result. To isolate the problem I connected my PC directly to the ISP and experienced no problems navigating to the sites the router would not navigate to. Exhausting all options I contacted ASUS support. Now I presently have an ASUS motherboard in my main PC and have an ASUS PC serving as an HTPC all without issue EVER! So I have nothing against ASUS from past experiences basically because all my other products have performed flawlessly. This support contact has been disappointing. All I have received was a "canned" email response instructing me to do everything that I had already done twice. My ultimate choice to restore my navigating issue was to put back on line a 7 year old Linksys WRT54GL. Slow but it performs. I will wait a couple more days and if ASUS cannot resolve the problem I will return the router.
5,Easy to configure and with a built in web interface which many prefer over the software tools.You can either set it up as an Router Access-point. Installed it on the second floor of our 3800 sqft house and the coverage is pretty good throughout the house and backyard.The four 100/1000 ports on the back allow for twisted pair connections (Switch PC gaming console Server...)The USB3 ports can be used as a print server or for USB storage (external drives or thumb drives) to be shared over the network.Even in AP mode with DHCP off it still shows all (wired and wireless) devices on the network with their name IP and Mac address.It supports wireless schedule and a reboot schedule. Latter is nice since I noticed it tends to get sluggish after a couple of weeks requiring a reboot.
5,Router came in on time with everything need to setup. The user interface is fine and with plenty of options for an experienced user like a Technician or maybe a serious Gamer but it may be somewhat overpowering for the regular user. This does not take away from the fact that it is an excellent router. I love the fact that I can connect directly to my VPN with the Asus router and the wifi speeds are great. All in all I'd say this is a router well worth getting.
5,My older router was dyin'The wifi signal was lyin'Downloading stuff? I was tryin'.My wife? Well she was cryin'.Time to go online for buyin'.Then along came this router. It wasn't the most expensive. It had all I yearned for.Easy to set up. Then I looked up and sang:Streaming was fixedmy woes were nixed.Out of 1 to 5 I give it six.
5,after setting it up i had some connectivity issues which i could not resolve so i called support.  it did take a few calls and emails to resolve the issues but i am very impressed that asus kept working through things escalating to higher support. support even asked when would be the best time to call back.  they even called twice to make sure that everything was working correctly.  this kind of support is so unusual these days.the router works well w/ my very internet connected home. i think the only problems i have are due to my ISP not having enough bandwidth in my area.
5,Got this to go with our new Starlink internet and they perform well together.  No hiccups from the router at all.  Interface is easy but has advanced features as well.  Wifi has been a solid performer for both older 2.GHz devices and the newer 5GHz ones.
5,For a couple years now we felt like our internet was slower. Thinking it was just from adding more wifi-run devices we dealt with the slow speeds. Cable company tried several times to troubleshoot. Nothing improved. Until a tech at the modem company ran a ton of in depth tests and suggested it was our router. I had a friend recommend this router and it’s been amazing! We have a 1300 aw foot 2-story apartment and everything runs a million times faster!!!
4,Used this router in a larger 2 story house. Worked well except the farthest away room. But if I got close to the window I connected.Lasted 32 months less than I expected. Time to upgrade anyway
1,I tried two of these and neither one would connect after numerous attempts over numerous days. Attempted to contact customer support without success. One of them said Cisco when it came up as nearby network. I am in the process of returning both. I went with a Netgear product which connected easily and flawlessly. I went with Asus just because of my previous good luck with an Asus router. Now  Netgear will be all of my future router purchases.
5,This helped a lot with my streaming problems. No more freezing in the middle of a movie. Easy set up too. I live in an old Victorian and the router is upstairs but my main TV is down stairs and the signal to the TV is great.
5,I've only had this about a month but so far everything is great. Setup was pretty straight forward. Had a password issue (when changing a password there's a couple different places it has to be changed) but once I got that straight everything was fine. Connection speeds are good reliable and haven't had any issues or reason to need to contact tech support. All wireless devices in my home are working properly & at the desired speeds. Hopeful about its longevity but can't review that aspect at this point.
5,Bought to increase my WiFi signal in my house.  Wish I would have bought a similar WiFi router in 2015 because with that router I have to use a signal extender. Set up was easy!  All had to do was turn off modem and PC and disconnect the old router and hook up the new router.  Changed default passwords back to my 40 character each 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies and I was set!  Went from 750 MHZ (300 MHZ & 450 MHZ) to 1750 MHZ (1000 MHZ & 750 MHZ) and I can tell the difference immediately after set up.  Might not need the Wi-Fi extender that I bought for my other router.
5,Fast and easy setup. Only been working a couple of days but it appears all is well. Getting 65mb download on a 60mb modem and that is through the router via Spectrum Internet. All 5 ghz wireless devices are working smooth the 2.4 ghz has a great signal all throughout the house. Was able to eliminate a range extender too. Upon installation the router did a firmware update it went smoothly. Very satisfied so far!! speed was the same when hooked directly to the modem 65mb. I would buy again. FYI: I have a RT-N66U in servers for 3 years and have never had to reset or restart it it is in a small business location. VERY happy with that unit.
5,I absolutely love this router! ASUS nailed it with out of the box dynamic DNS and OpenVPN server features that just work!Currently using this router for a small business network and seeing full 225/15 Mbps throughput from my ISP over wired and about 120/15 Mbps on wireless. No complaints whatsoever! It was incredibly easy to get dynamic dns and OpenVPN working - ten minutes to a fully functioning small office network including LAN device DHCP reservation! Love it!
5,Works great. I pay for gigabit internet but my modem unfortunately has to sit in the opposite side of the house from me. This router is now sitting in my office and does a great job of filling all of the coverage gaps in my home.
5,After many years finally got H.S.-NET-got this router to go with an old Asus--works great and eazy set-up.Asus makes QUALITY products!!!  Robert
1,The range of this router is incredibly small.  It also takes too long and often fails to make a mesh node because it takes soooo long to reboot which the ai-mesh addition process needs to do.  I would highly recommend against buying this.  The price is right but the very definition of you get what you pay for.
5,There are hundreds of option combinations you can make to really customize it to your needs.The 5GHz band loses it's signal strength really quickly as you move away from the router.  Not good.  I do like that it has Trend Micro anti-virus built in to help block those bugs you can get via wireless.One small drawback is that there isn't a menu that pops up if there was an "i" for info to tell you what each setting means to help you decide what parameter to choose.
5,I was hesitant to buy this at first.  I needed a router to reach a third floor with at least good reception.  It not only reached the third floor but the reception is excellent.  No more picture freezing or pixilation etc.  Netflix used to take forever to download (when it would download that is) and watching was terrible.  Now it is instantaneous and no more freezing!Selfishly I never send in a review on the products that I buy.  But I simply had to send this one in because I have never been so happy about a purchase as this one.  2 words -'BUY IT'!
1,I like the interface and the software along with the app but but I never got the speed out of this. Always under 100Mb/s. My old modem was getting almost 400Mb/s
5,Had this set up in 5 minutes. Nice user interface. Drastically improved my connection speeds because I was still using older model linksys router. Would recommend. Will edit review if something goes wrong. Have not had to deal with tech support yet.
1,I don't think I wrote too many bad reviews but this piece of garbage deserves one. I purchased this a little over a month ago. It worked fine for a couple of weeks now I am lucky to get a signal from it at all. I tested my connection with the Internet provider and it was fine - but when I checked the output signal from this router it would put out a signal periodically. Sometimes I can get the 2G signal to work sometimes it would be the 5G and sometimes there was nothing at all. It is pretty sad. Now what I have ended up doing is using my phone as a hotspot. Do yourself a big favor – DO NOT buy this piece of garbage.
5,My older ASUS router provided 100 mb Ethernet only which is slower than my Internet speeds. This one has 4 gigabit ports and works at full speed. Fast with a strong signal that covers my 1000 s.f. apartment nicely as well as our balcony outside. No compatibility issues with any of my devices and also works fantastically with wired devices. ASUS's management UI is pretty good and there are still occasional firmware updates.
4,This is one of the models recommended by our Internet Provider.  The modem seems to be working just fine.Set up was a little confusing as if you are not a "techie" person the set up process of adding passwords or re-naming the unit is not obvious. You have to go to advance settings and I feel this should be right in your face.
4,The Asus router came programed for 192.16.1.50.  Some equipment on my system would not respond to the router with that configuration.  Changing it back to 1.1 fixed the problem.  This unit replaced my Linksys (much faster router) that was constantly dropping cell phones and other devices.  Now with the Asus router No dropped connections No "Resetting the Router" No resetting the modem No more problems with my network!  I'll never Linksys again!
5,Bought a third one because it was bad but because these have become a staple in my home.  This new revision B1 is great it does everything that my old AC68U (which died after 8 years of service) does and it has a faster processor and more updated guts compared to the AC68U that I bought 8 years ago.Forget all those crazy fancy crazy units that has 8 antennas.  This AC66U B1 now supports AiMesh so just pick up several of these and sprinkle them around the house with it it'll definitely have better coverage than a single AC5300 which are gimmicky at best...
1,I plugged this in and the device did not work. It does not light up or turn on. I am 5 days out of the amazon return policy and I don't know how to get ahold of the seller to help be return the item.
5,It takes time to get used to and look through all the functions. I slapped Merlin firmware on it.I currently have two usb fans plugged into the outlet and strapped with cable ties. One fan on the router and one fan on the cable modem for any heat issues.  Temperature 105 F.I have not used the 5 GHZ frequency but I have used the 2.4 GHZ. Does good for netflix wifi etc.
5,My apartment is long and a little narrow. I have the router on one side of the apt. in my office and the old one wasn't reaching to my living room on the very other end. I was getting about 15mbps or nothing and eating up cell phone data in the process because I'd just get frustrated and switch off WiFi. When I plugged this guy in my 5G connection shot up to 114mbps on average all the way through the apartment only degrading to about 108 when I was as far as possible from the router while still being inside. Now I only use the 5G connection because the range is so good. Worth the money.
5,First off it’s a great router. Definitely don’t know how they pack all that punch at such a low price point.The user interface is clean and nice for the novice or advanced user. Additionally there are gobs of resources online for this router for any guidance you may need down the line.
4,It seemed to install pretty good
5,The Asus RT-AC66u B1 router is  excellent.  It works like a charm and has the advantage of having dual band wifi.  The range is fine for a private home and it handles multiple users with ease.  I updated the Firmware immediately upon starting the unit.  The only difficulty I experienced with the install was in getting the proper credentials from the Internet Provider to enter into the system as the auto install program did not pick that up from Frontier (not the best provider but the only one available here).  I have had no issues at all with this unit.  I recommend it.
5,Stronger signal that reaches the corners of my property (75yds). I did not realize how much pleasure a minor purchase / upgrade could make to my wifi lifestyle.....
4,I had purchased other Asus routers before and knew I would get similar reliability. I think my past Asus router burnt up in a lightning strike. I log into these routers so seldom administratively. They just work. I run this router on my Spectrum cable.So solid product.
5,The Quick Internet Setup wizard made it easy to create my network both wired and wireless.  Making a guest network was simple also.  Now I have 6 machines connected on a LAN and connected to the WAN (global internet) and all seem to be working fine.  The speed is super and the reach is good.  One computer (a Raspberry Pi) at the far end of the house has connected through the wireless guest network and seems to be fine.  I'd like to install the Merlin firmware but the stock firmware is working well and I have not needed an extra capabilities yet.
4,I had been happy with this router during its first year of use. It performed well but lacked the power to reach all corners of my fairly large house. I recently upgraded the firmware and it now performs much better. I am still using a range extender on the top floor (two floors above the router) but all other areas of the house are getting a good-to-excellent signal directly from the router.
5,I've used other Asus routers that were more expensive but for the installation where I'm using this one (a condo) this model is more than adequate to cover the entire space and Asus set-ups are super easy. I really appreciate their easy to use interface and app control ability.
5,Very easy to setup and use however after being prompted to change the username and password for administrative access my password is not accepted so I am now unable to make any further changes to the router settings...not that I expect that I will ever need to. I recommend keeping the default username and password (or use a simple password rather than a complex one) but otherwise the signal is excellent and I have had no other issues.
5,It’s working like a dream. Had bought some stupid Tenda router and it kept disconnecting from my cable modem. I didn’t know which one was the problem. This thing worked great and has awesome GUI/browser features.
4,I bought this to use as an AI-Mesh access point and while it does work well 98% of the time there are definitely still hiccups in the system. (The device will go offline once in a while directing all network traffic to my main router or just cutting it off entirely)I am hopeful that eventually everything will be ironed-out as ASUS regularly pushes out firmware updates for all of these devices.
5,After spending hours in vain trying to get a NetGear Nighthawk AC7800 to work as a Repeater without an Ethernet connection I quit and returned it. I then ordered the Asus RT-AC66U. That alone saved over $100. After unboxing and connecting via an Ethernet cable to my laptop i had it completely st up and working as a Bridge Repeater (without an Ethernet cable so it can be located anywhere on the network). The software is solid and everything just works. Off to install at clients' today.  Good job Asus!
4,Like it
4,This box came from SpaceBound promptly and in a good condition. I simply took the router out plugged it in near my main router while I had the main router's webpage open and proceeded to perform AIMESH discovery.  The router was found and AImesh took it over. yay. worked as advertised.  I have another router of this model that works just fine as well.
5,Includes antivirus and intrusion detection on-board.  Has good graphical reporting on network usage so you can spot the culprit that ate your data cap AND QOS tools to impose data rate limits on things like your Roku box to protect against data overages.  Really happy with this router.
4,Easy to install. Signal strong for my 4800 sqft home. So far so good.
1,This thing is a mess I'm genuinely a big fan of Asus after having bought a laptop from them that I absolutely loved.  I had really high hopes for this router but it's genuinely terrible.  I bought this to replace my 7 year older Linksys E2000 because it was having wifi dropouts and frequent overheating issues. I got the B1 version with some of the new improvements and instantly installed the latest firmware.  This thing has been nothing but headaches there was really no noticeable speed increase or distance increase compared to my E2000 which I didn't really care about.  I cared more about consistency and reliability and this router had none of that.  The wifi is insanely inconsistent frequently dropping out requiring me to toggle my connection to it.  Tried various setting and recommendations online to turn off the switching from 20/40/80GHz to one consistent value tried toggling the Tx Power.  The only improvements I saw were from disabling the QoS feature.  (Makes me wonder why it's there if it only makes things worse.)  There are also constant issues with the LAN frequent ping spikes throughout the day to anywhere from 300-800.  To top it off the family controls don't work properly I've tried setting times and adjusting them but it doesn't seem to make a difference the internet just completely shuts off at all times in the day.I honestly keep trying to get this thing to work changing different setting troubleshooting my connection but honestly it's not worth the hassle.  Did not even last a month.
5,I decided to cut the cord on cable and just go with streaming devices so I needed a new router to supply a steady signal. This keeps up with an Xbox iPad two phones and another TV streaming Netflix at the same time. Being able to control what goes on what channel is nice plus the app is very easy to use. It allows you to limit certain devices at certain times and more. I should add that this unit is in my room above the garage and it has enough range for a two story house.
3,Overall this is a good unit without storage.  However when I attached a 3.0 USB 8 TB drive to it its CPU usage hovered around 90% and wireless connections were lost after a few hours.  I had to power cycle it three times in 12 hours to resolve no WiFi.  Also had to install the Merlin version to get SMB2 - Hard to understand why the manufacture does not provide this capability - This does not provide a good feeling about any of product made by ASUS ( I am in the market for a motherboard - hint if anyone is paying attention ).
4,Signal doesn't go as far as our old one.
1,I purchased this because it came with parental controls. They simply do NOT work!!! I create time schedules and they do NOT take effect when they are supposed to. I block the use of games and that does NOT work. I block ports and that does NOT work. I have tried to reboot the router (some say you have to do that for your settings to take effect) and that did NOT work. Their online help is actually inaccurate in some places and clear in others but nothing I try works! The only thing that does work is a kill switch that allows me to completely take down my son's internet connection. Although that is fun to use the fact that I have to do it manually and the fact that I cannot block games during school or homework hours means the product simply does NOT come anywhere close to providing the functionality that I thought I was buying. Their website does not seem to offer a viable way to contact them for customer support either. It's just an endless maze of links. I watched hours of YouTube videos and did other research online and in the end it simply doesn't work.
1,What a PITA this router is! I also got the "Your ISP’s DHCP Does Not Function Properly" message. It was not my ISP. I had internet when I bypassed the router and went directly to the computer. After much research I was able to change the settings and resolve this. But now it's losing Wifi connection at least twice an hour. I'm not going to spend this kind of time and money on a router that gives me nothing but trouble. DO NOT BUY.
4,+ Fast and stable Wired/ wireless connection functions of the stock firmware is enough for daily usage. Also has access to Asuswrt-Merlin should be able to enhance its capabilities haven't tried out tho.- Heat generation can be directly felt. I put it on my wooden desk and sometimes I can touch the temperature from below the wooden surface. May impact stability during hot/ summer times.
4,Tiene buena señal y la configuración es fácil  se recomienda una base refrigerante ya que puede presentar sobre calentamiento
5,I've setup three Asus routers in my home to expand the network. The AiMesh nodes are both this router which sets up in under 5 minutes. The dual band 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz automatically on the SSID is fantastic.
5,C'mon Amazon show the reviews for a specific item in that item page not a bunch of irrelevant information! These reviews mean nothing and are no help whatsoever.UPDATE: I have used this Asus AC1750 router for a week now and it performs perfectly. This is the second router I have purchased from Asus and both are stellar performers. I also use Asus motherboards on all of my computer builds. A good company with good products. The range is good as I can use the WiFi portion in any room of my house as well as in my detached garage. A true home run!
1,This router wouldn’t not work.  We called tech support and they said it was a defaulted product but would not back their product so we had to return it.  We bought a Netgear and I works get.
5,This router was recommended by our fiber internet service provider. It works well handles 150mbs service with no problems. Just be sure to go into the router via a browser and turn on the aiProtection. I think they should have it on by default.
5,Had this for almost 3 years and never had a problem with it.  Tried to upgrade to the ac86u and returned it and went back to this  which is reliable and more stable.
5,Really happy with this router. It was easy to set up straight forward to install. Signal is very strong. I set it up on my second floor and I have signal 400 feet up my driveway! Great unit.
5,I bought this router to replace the old Linksys router. I purchased Asus motherboard for my computer when I was in high school. I knew Asus did good job.  This router let me know that I am right again.
3,To be honest I thought I really like ASUS product based on cNET and PC reviews.  But this model is VERY slow to connect to WiFi.  It takes over 3 minutes to connect.  My 20 year old Belkin that this product replaced connected instantly.
3,We purchased this to connect to our wireless Asus router and followed the instructions to create a mesh network.  The mesh network was unstable and we constantly received messages that our internet was not connected.  We  disconnected the mesh network and went back to using the Asus wireless router we already had and the signal was good and stayed connected.  We dont recommend this router for mesh networking because it's unstable and poor.
4,No problems with the WIFI but the online support seems daunting.
5,Easy to set up and works well for all our wi-fi tv streaming and internet at a fraction of the cost of other leading brands.
5,Good wi-fi router.  works great.
3,I have found this router to be decent but there are certain things I am wary of. The software is fine and set up was easy. There area a lot of extra bells and whistles that I don't need like cloud access and USB HD. This stuff is fine in theory but it allows for security vulnerabilities. That's the main problem with this unit. Asus has a bad history of data breaches so much so that the FCC requires a third party to audit its firmware. You could argue that that problems are "fixed" but fundamentally it's a company that does not care about security and frankly what is a router other than a network security device. I will probably just get a real router and re-configure this as an AP.
5,The signal is definitely improved. I am connected to the internet in all corners of the house and beyond. I can also connect all my devices now. With my old router that wasn’t the case.
5,Excellent product just make sure you update it once in a while or I can give you problems I love the iMesh opinion.
5,Great signal nice app easy to set up.This works very well for fios - it’s cheaper to buy this than rent theirs for a year and you get to keep this one!
5,Great Router this is my second one first one burned up in the fire I went and bought another ASUS.I love the setup and control I have over my network I am a hands on retired ITGuy.or you could just follow the easy setup and leave it be with the default settings.When a guest comes over I give them the separate guest access which isolates them from my network butgives them full access to the internet.Built in parental controls locking down by device.
2,I could not get the LAN port to show a signal going out so I called tech support.  Mind you I just got and so this was not well received that part of the reason for the router wasn't working.  Tech support took about 20 minutes on hold to answer and I told him the issue and he asked where I bought it model and when did I buy.  I told him and he said there was a recall issued two weeks prior due to the LAN ports not working.  I don't know why if that was true that Amazon would continue to sell.  So either he was not being truthful or Amazon continued to sell after a product recall.  Returned for refund.
5,Love Asus mother boards and my son told me about their routers. When my router needed replacement (Nighthawk R7000) I went to Asus. I cannot express how happy I am with this router. It has built in virus protection software as well as great processors. TV Movies and Gaming all run seamlessly with no lag. I believe anyone can set this up with the software that is included. Asus has made a fantastic router at a reasonable price.
4,Great router.  Love the bandwidth tracking by device\service.  No drops on 2.4 or 5GHz.  Just wish signal was a little stronger.
3,I installed the router within two hours it was hot to the touch.  The morning after I installed the router I picked up a folder that was beside the router and the folder was very warm.  I touched the router and it was so extremely hot that I disconnect it.  Unfortunately I purchased it before reading ALL reviews.  Overheating is definitely mentioned frequently in many reviews.  I am returning it.  ASUS customer support was FANTASTIC.  I have no complaints about that so I wish the router had not had an issue.
4,This company has nothing but foreign employees that have a heavy accent making it very difficult to understand them.especiallyvfor the elderly like me.
4,This product is working and is just fine
5,Unless you do quick setup from the dashboard it can be difficult. I had a hard time connecting to router.asus.com dashboard with my hard-wired MacBook Pro and had to resort to my iPad. I’ve done several installations and had to contact support every time sometimes having to perform factory resets. It’s sometimes difficult to assign a new Id and password for the router name. Once installed it’s a very good router.
5,This unit is a big improvement over my older unit.  It is very easy to install.  There are far more features than I need.  It is a good value and an excellent product.
5,I spent several days researching & reading reviews for a replacement for my home wifi router. The Asus Rt-Ac66u B1 came out a clear winner at an unbeatable price. It set up easily and is working perfectly has twice the range of my old router (it's reviewed as one of the best for range). Couldn't be happier! (Make sure you get the B1 version the previous version is completely different and does not perform nearly as well).
5,Can install Merlin on this unit but can't install DDWRT OpenWRT Tomato ETC due to GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE.So much for the Land of the Free.
5,Works as advertised. Highly recommended. Excellent signal strength and range in and outside of my apartment.
5,Solved my internet wifi issues.I have 135 sqaure meter house. and the wifi reaches the street near me.amazing stability (no more connection losses). the network didnt crash once.For Israeli Users.:  i have ISP called HOT and it works perfectly with the AP mode ! (100MBps)Excellent for network gaming / family general internet needs ( we have 5 persons with smarthphones  3 computers and 4 streamers).Highly recommanded product. fits for israeli needs.takes 110~220v only needs socket adapter.
1,This router was recommended to be purchased with the NETGEAR modem. Had issue with the router service so I called the company. An Indian guy who claimed he was based in Los Angeles CA  which I doubt because after speaking for 40 mins he could not resolve the issue I was having. He was a tech support for Asus and it was 345pm CA time when he gave up and said he had to go home because his shift was over. I was shocked because I said nobody does that as Customer support and if he was in CA it was kind of early leave . He kept quiet and because the name he gave me (Eric Thomas ) which I think was a fake name so I can't report him he said he will call me back the next day but didn't.  I opted to return the products because Netgear claimed it was a router issue and Asus claimed it was a modem issue.  I hate dealing with customer service that are not local in the USA.
5,A+ purchase. I have this setup as a VPN router off my FIOS router. It took a while to connect via WAN possibly because I didn't know what I was doing or maybe it just needs time to make the connection. After that the VPN setup was super easy. I have no experience setting up a router and was able to get the ASUS fully up and running within 2 hours. My download speeds are also now 3x faster than off the FIOs router. Highly recommended.
5,Arrived on time. Set up was easy and instructions were clear. I renamed the router using my old  router's name and same password. All my devices connected
5,I was recommended this per a online acquaintance to replace my Netgear router that died. I was not wanting to spend as much on this as I did because the past few routers I bought that cost more did not last long. A longer router that cost a 1/4 of this was working but limiting. Once it arrived and I got it setup it has worked perfect and even improved the wifi signals greatly.
1,I am not sure what Asus has done lately but this router has become unbearable andmajorly problematic to connect to another Asus router as a satellite or node . It wasworking fine for the past few months until yesterday when it mysteriously disconnectedfrom the AiMesh network. To get it back online has been pure hell. It connects but weaklyeven if close to the main router and then it disconnects or says it is offline. I tried again toconnect as a node AiMesh and it worked connecting wirelessly but there is a problemwhen I connect the ethernet cable for a wired backhaul (ethernet cable from the node's WANport to the main router's LAN port (using a switch as was recommended and has workedprior to yesterday).I wish to get rid of this fake router and maybe get something else to serve as an AiMesh node.
5,If you're familiar with Asus routers and their interfaces you won't have any problems here. Up and running with my previous router's settings in minutes didnt even need to reset the wifi settings on my devices.
5,Hands down best router I've owned even though not as expensive as others
5,It was what the internet provider said to use for service. Works great and so fast.Very nice!!
3,So far so good. Potential buyers should be aware that this uses the same defective power switch as on the previous model the Asus RT-N66U. The switch can suddenly break for no reason after which the power button will not stay down. You can jam a toothpick in there or open up the router and pull the spring out of the switch which leaves it "on" all the time.Still a good router for the price. My old RT-N66U is now a wireless access point minus a working power switch.I bought a 3-year Square Trade warranty because of the problematic power switch. It was only $1.95.
5,DEFINATELY AN UPGRADE FROM MY INTERNET PROVIDERS STANDARD EQUIPMENT. VERY EZ TO SELF INSTALL
5,Basic installation of this router was very easy and it works very well. Its WiFi signal covers my entire home effectively and reconnections to WiFi are fast. I initially had trouble getting the device to download its latest firmware and Tech Service wasn't able to identify the problem. However I eventually figured it out myself and the device has worked well since.
5,Easy to setup. I ordered 2 to setup as an Asus AiMesh network. I had a minor issue during setup & Asus tech support was great.....even called me back when our cell call was dropped.AiMesh is working great. Only 2-3% signal degradation within our 2700sqft home. This is the 3rd Asus router(s) that I have owned after Belkin Cisco & Netgear.The Asus router app is great for accessing the router/AiMesh settings.
4,I purchased this router a few months ago and it seems to really be working well.  I usually have Xbox One (wireless) PC game (wired) and someone watching some kind of stream on at least 2 other devices.  Haven't had any issues  I have around a 100MB connection.
5,Plugged into modem and got excellent WiFi single throughout my house exactly what I wanted.
2,Keeps losing connection. I have to turn the router off and on to get it to work again. The app you can use in a smartphone randomly says it can’t connect to router anymore and I have to do a hard reset to do the admin log in stuff to set myself a log in in order to get that app to work again. Logging into the router on a computer rarely works. I logged in to change some settings today (6/4/21) and as soon as I got in and clicked on a setting it disconnected and I haven’t been able to get back in all day now.
5,This router was recommended by my fiber optic ISP.  It has worked well for a moderate user of the internet and the price on Amazon was very reasonable.
5,Bought this to replace an aging RT-N16. The performance is way better with the updated hardware. The range also has improved significantly and can get service throughout the entire home and even in the backyard. For the money it's a great router with good features and top notch performance. It's really the same guts as the ASUS AC1900 for a good chunk of change less.
4,Outside cameras
5,Super simple to setup and use.  And it makes it so simple to be able to make changes to my network.  The range on the 2.4 and 5g are excellent.  One was enough to provide coverage for my whole house and even into my yard.
5,This is my 2nd Asus router. The other one was great but it was 5+ yrs old and was just its time. This router is super easy to set up and if you have any experience with asus routers its ever easier because the setup looks just like the older models setup. Great Range and the price is competitive with other routers in its class
5,Plug and play! Hubby set it up in about 1.5 minutes and the signal reaches clear across the house. We even got rid of our WiFi extender don't need it anymore.
3,Nice router but it drops out way more often than it should. I have tried all the tricks I can find online but it still drops out once every couple of days. Other than that it has good range and signal strength.
5,This was an upgrade to my old router.  What a difference super fast and great coverage!
5,I owned AC1900 and other Asus routers before. This is for my brother and as for Asus router reputation this work well as expected. It's easy to set up and I put it on second floor and has pretty decent signal distance travel to a room on the first floor through brick/ concrete walls. I wish it comes in white color as it's easier to see in the dark room.
4,Works great but they went cheap and the antennas are not replaceable! I have large ones that are much better but can't use.
5,Great upgrade from my old router. Great signal without an extender in my entire house!
4,I have a few of these and they work great. But they recently changed the design. I mount them on the wall but now they no longer have the ability to do that. I have to find some kind of bracket that will fit it. Very strange they would do that.
5,I am amazed how much quicker/stronger my wifi signal is.  The day I set it up earlier I had downgraded my internet service.  With this router it's a step up from the service I had before I downgraded!  Didn't realize what a difference a good router makes.  Highly recommend! (I buy lots on Amazon and rarely post reviews unless something is really awful or really good.  This is obviously the latter).
4,Arrived at stated date and time. Excellent value. A little daunting on setup for someone that started out on card reading computers but after reading through the manual it has been set up and is functioning.When in doubt follow the labeled instructions.At least three times faster download speeds as compared to an N type router!
5,Excelente equipo. Mejoro un 100% la velocidad de internet por wifi. Tengo gran cobertura de la señal en todas las zonas de mi hogar y la administración del equipo es muy sencilla. Estoy muy conforme con el producto lo recomiendo.
5,The ASUS RT-AC66U was easy to set up and is working well so far.  It gives good coverage on the main floor. I haven' tried using my laptop in the basement yet but I don't expect any problems. I'm not a power user (no gaming or streaming movies) for what I need it works well.
3,I bought this in May and it was great but after four months of owning it two of my Ethernet lan ports wasn’t working. I tried firmware update and factory resetting my router. Nothing works. Wish I can give it 5 star but now I can only give it a 3 since it still gives me great WiFi signal and 2 working ports. Hope there is a solution to this.
5,Best $100.00 router made. My internet speed is 250 mps download and upload. This router gives me 230 mps speed on 5g wireless  through 3 walls and 100 feet away
3,Twice as fast as the isp router. But does not work well with iPhones. Probably an apple problem.
5,Got the router today. Took about 20 minutes to set up. Wow I cant believe I suffered for so long!! This router is fantastic. The speed and WiFi coverage is fantastic.
5,This replaces an older Netgear model and increased the range and speed both by at least 75%.  Gave full coverage of the house.
5,Good speed does a great job as a relay as well as AP. Like the openvpn server for remote connection to Blue Iris.
5,Easy to use right out of the box. Exceptional range.
4,Works great. Run's HOT!
5,easy plug and play and great service
5,Works great!
3,Nothing wrong with the router works great for the price but I bought it to add as an AP but my bad i guess I didn't read that it didn't have smart connect  like the ASUS router I have.  So I took it down.
5,Amazing router I have not gamed with it just yet but the way it handles QOS and VOIP surprised me. Also it has a lot of great features (VPN firewall Traffic analyzer etc)No more dropped calls with calling over wifi and improved speeds overall. For the price of $99 at the time I picked it up. I'm very happy with this device.
2,I purchased this router because it was the cheapest that would support AiMesh but it was twice the price as a router that didn't. It's not a good router to use as a node mostly because of software limitations that Asus could fix if they chose to.Even though the router is attached to my network via an ethernet cable the 5GHz band is still used by AiMesh and devices are not allowed to connect essentially making this only a 2.4GHz node. In addition the guest network is not extended as part of AiMesh. So if your IoT devices are on a guest network (and they should be btw) this router will not help you.Setup involves throwing away the Asus directions and checking the message boards to learn how to actually setup the router.Essentially I should have paid half as much and purchased a non-AiMesh router but I'm hoping that Asus fixes their firmware.
5,Two TV's 3 computers 5 cellphones/tablets all working simultaneouslyno problems
5,I installed this router today and can confirm that it is a great product. The Asus formware is great out of the box. VPN config was a breeze. It’s coverage is great and speed is consistent downstream and up no matter where I am in the house. It runs warm not hot so it definitely has a good heat sync on board. Quality product.
5,This router is great if you are experiencing dead zones. I had 0 internet in certain areas in my house now I have download speeds of 30mbps there.Good product
5,Setup is extremely easy. System interface to update router name and passwords are super simple.Used a dual band Netgear router (comparable AC1750 router) and usually got 15 mbps on a 100 mbps internet plan from Cox. Now I consistently get 120-130 on that same 100 mbps plan. Upload is around 12-13 for me.Couldn’t be happier; will update if anything goes wrong.
5,This thing is awesome.  Very easy to set up and is far superior to my Verizon router.  Now I just use that as a modem and this has become my wireless router for the house.  I also like that there's two different networks so I can put only things that need the extra speed on the 5G network and leave the slower stuff on the 2G so they don't clash as much.
5,Note: if you get the AC1750 be sure it is the revision B! The earlier version was hit or miss going by what I have read on reviews here. It runs warm to the touch (normal operating condition.).Wireless is faster than what I replaced it with (the NT66U). I've had it only less than 24 hours so it's too early to tell about long term reliability. The AC66U-B1 seems to get very favorable reviews here.
3,Three weeks after the return window closed this router seized up. The circuit board fried and it ceased broadcasting. A real piece of junk. Do not buy ASUS products.
1,i read reviews both on amazon and websites that were supposed to be reliable when it came to routers and all of them said this was a great router for someone who plays MMOs. that could not be farther from the truth. this isn't even a good router to use for a single phone to browse twitter with much less play games or download anything or stream movies or videos.when it's not choking my internet speeds to 900kbps to 5mbps it's just not working! at all! i have to reset it at LEAST twice a day for it to work for 30 minutes without disconnecting for several minutes at a time. this isn't worth $10 and it's selling for $100? a complete joke of a router. i bought a $50 cisco router in 2010 that has better speeds and less connection errors than this glorified paperweight.nothing makes this thing work -- i check for firmware updates EVERY SINGLE DAY i enable QOS i monitor the connected devices to make sure they're not destroying the bandwidth and time and again this router just gives up as soon as i launch anything more taxing than the calculator app.do not buy this. personally i'm never buying an ASUS branded router again.
5,This router is great the default firmware is really good has a lot of options plus you can use other Homebrew firmware like tomato and others on the router without voiding the warranty.
5,Works great easy setup and can't respond about tech support haven't needed any yet.
5,Lo uso mucho para crear VPN cliente servidor con 2 de estos.
5,Easy to install and high speed capacity
4,Provides tremendous speed but does not reach as far as previous Netgear router. Will have to purchase an extender. Does not extend to back porch as did Netgear router.
5,Works perfectly.  Great seller. Good price and shipped fast. Would definitely buy again.
1,I received two of these routers at two different times. They are counterfeit Asus routers and a piece of junk. I called the Asus technician and they couldn't find any of the router S/N on their system and they are both Counterfeit. Each s/n of each router is not from the Asus. Buyers beware!
5,Upgraded from a Linksys something-whatever. Way better range. I’d estimate 50’ farther for 5g. USB storage and SMB server is great.
5,Very easy to set up and never just goes out on us
3,Although I bought it bc the range it has but I still experience signal drop in my room and my house only 1400 sf.
1,I tried to buy this product refurbished to keep electronics out of the waste stream. The first unit I received was DOA so I returned it and asked for replacement. The second was unable to connect to the internet at all. I'm not new to Wifi setup so either this product is ULTRA complicated to setup or it was also non-functional. I spent hours trying to troubleshoot this because I assumed it was my fault... but nothing worked. I'm left feeling that I lost hours of my life trying to troubleshoot a router that was returned by the previous owner because it was broken in the first place. AND I have a useless router that it outside of its return window. Unlikely to buy refurbished from Amazon again.
1,When i connected everything as prescribed in the easy 123 guide I could not get internet connection due to this error depicted on the Asus dashboard "Your ISP's DHCP is not functioning properly." I called Asus and was told it's my ISP's issue to resolve. I have Comcast Xfinity so I went to their store to speak to a tech rep. I was told Comcast does not handle/del with routers only modems and was given a phone # to call for further assistance. I call the number and was prompted from one robo voice to another and none of them let me discus the root problem my new Asus router. I contacted Amazon and even though I was way past my return for refund date they let me return it for a refund! Amazing customer service unlike Asus & Comcast.  DO NOT buy this product! There is nothing easy about getting it hooked up.
5,Excellent router especially for the price. I live in a small house (660 sq. Ft) and get WiFi everywhere as well as my backyard. It was very easy to set up just took a couple of minutes. I’m very happy with this router and would recommend it.
5,Fantastic router! Easy to set up and works like a charm. Big jump in speed. This is essentially a RT-AC68U which is helpful when you're interested in flashing third-party firmware. The only "drawback": I could not get the router to work using a CAT6 cable for WAN. It seems to only work with a CAT5e cable but there is one included in the box. CAT6 works for LAN however and it works great!
5,Easy to setup great Router.
5,Easy set up. Using with Netgear CM700 modem. No issues. Lots of features.
5,Excellent choice 5G and 2g
5,A DirecTV tech called out when we lost our internet connection for our TVs "diagnosed" our genie box as having lost its antenna (lightning storm). Bummer right? No more on demand. But when I bought and installed the ASUS AC1750 router the connection "magically" reappeared. Bravo ASUS! Great router!
4,So far so good range is pretty great. Getting this router made me realize alot of my bandwidth problems previously were because my router was so crappy. Barely have any ping spiking with this router.
5,Router has great range and super easy set up I eliminated the several extenders in my home.
4,Great router! I use with the aimesh config to extend Wifi and network.
5,Bought as the replacement for 2.4Ghz router. Covers larger area. Easy to navigate user interface.
3,Setup:  My setup document (one page included with router) - the router name and passwords did not match the unit.  Accurate username and password were on the bottom of the actual unit - however could not access the initial admin / admin log in until I did a factory reset.  A 5 minute process took a couple of hours of figuring out.  Save yourself the hassle - if admin / admin does not work hit the reset.
5,Seems to be good
5,Great 2.4 and 5G performance.  Simple interface with an app for your phone or tablet to manage multiple connections for families and homes. Includes tools to fight malware and scan for problems including assessing strength of your encryption and passwords. I highly recommend ASUS routers!
4,Works great - big upgrade from my previous AP.  Both bands have great coverage - make sure to orient one of the antennas parallel to the ground that can give you a good performance boost.
5,Great powerful router with great coverage.  No longer need extenders. Solid value
4,It works way better and has a lot more features than my old router from 2008. For what I paid for it it's pretty good.I would recommend this router to others.
5,So far so good. We do have better wi fi but not done yet
5,To upgrade my old router and be able to use in three rooms and for my wireless printer. Very easy to install and reasonably priced.
1,Bought this router for my parents and its been nothing but a pain in the butt. The wifi signals both lose connection on both the 2G and the 5G. Asus customer support is worthless. I tried to submit a RMA and they stated that they only can fix items manufactured in the USA. This router says it was made in Vietnam. Waste of time and money. I've reset the router multiple times and updated it to the latest firmware and it still has connectivity issues. The 2G and 5G signal lights on the router are lit up even though there is no connection. I have tested this signals on multiple devices and they all have connectivity issues.
5,Works great. Waited a few months to make sure it worked as described and it does. I get fast speed internet all throughout the house and haven’t received any fading out. Definitely recommend this product.
5,Good strong quality signal very easy to set up. Has the 2g and the 5g. Some of my stuff requires the 2g. The 5g is fast. Bought 2 of these worth the money
3,Easy to set up but I’m not getting the signal coverage as others are saying they are getting. It’s about the same as my att router.
5,Bought this as a second router to create an AiMesh system for my home's wifi. Setup was easy and now I have full signal accross my entire 3000 square foot home.
5,We needed a new router and modem to replace old ones. These were recommended by a friend and have worked very well since installed. No problems at this point!
5,it works
5,Works great. Covers my entire 1400 sqare foot home. Never lose more than 1 bar even at the furthest point and never lose more than 2 bars when in "eco mode." Love being able to control settings from my phone even when I'm not on the WiFi (just make sure to enable remote access before leaving WiFi the first time).
5,This router is a perfect balance between speed signal quality range features and cost.  Highly recommended.
4,Quality isn't as good as old N900 I had for 4 years.  It looks cheaper and does have a stand.
5,Basic household needs  always a great deal when you can save money and time but having it delivered.
3,It is very nice. The setup was bothersome because to access the router via a browser I had to use an IP that I've never used before and nowhere in any booklet or on the router itself was there an explanation to this I had to google for a good hour or two before I realized this awkward IP address was. As a product it runs fine but the other stuff made it irritating.
5,We replaced the Almond we bought in 2015 with this when we couldn't get a good connection anymore. Worth the money for sure we keep our consoles connected to the 5g and everybody else connects to the 2g. Awesome connection with fast speeds.
2,The unit works okay but after about of month of continuously being on it will stop working. I hard reset it and then it will work okay for another month. This is the second router. The first one was identical to this one but had this same problem. I initially thought that the first one was damaged by lightning and that this this second one was going to work but now it's doing the same thing as the first one.I may have to move away from the ASUS brand.
1,Orig Review: Had a little trouble setting it up. Called customer service was disconnected before they could be of help.  Finally figured it out myself.  Hint: You must connect it directly to your computer to set up then you can disconnect it from your computer.20 months later unit suddenly lost power.  Called customer service.  Got RMA number after filling out another set of forms.  I would have to pay for shipping.  If you get it from ASUS it was $16.34 and would take a few days to receive it.  They didn't specify who was the shipper.  UPS charge would be $20.59 and it would be picked up at my home.  Process was very round about.  I would expect the shipping to be FREE if unit is still under warranty. In addition I would be without my wifi for 3 + weeks - really!  I decided to buy another wifi router and use the shipping charge to reduce the amount of the cost.  ASUS lost my future business.
5,It does seem that my internet connection is stronger than before. I did have a little difficulty with installation. A friend helped me and got it figured out.
5,Until now the experience it's good... The WIFI are all around the house without lags. The installation was easy and fast just plug the Ethernet cables into the modem and conect the modem into electricity and woala! Some setting you need to do about wireles name and password but the wizard it's easy to understand.
4,Had a few issues with it. Could not log on the dasboard to secure netweork but after much hastling I was finally able to get it working.
5,Great features with dual band and four hard wire ports.  I like on off switch on back too. Going to keep in my room and switch off at night so the kids cant get on internet while i sleep. Off switch works for hard wired outputs too.
5,It's been working great for the two months I've had it. Not expecting any problems.
1,I was excited about this router because of it's features and regular firmware support. I installed it and unfortunately quickly threw away the box so it can't be returned. My internet connections (both wired and wireless) kept dropping so I would looking at the settings and logs for possible fixes. Eventually the router settings were no longer available by any means. It lights up but you can't access the GUI. After many months I decided to work on it again and try to resurrect it. I was finally able to access the GUI and configured everything again and it worked great for 2 hours then this process started all over again. Internet dropped configuration settings unavailable. This router is nothing more than a paper weight for me.
5,Two routers make AI Mesh (seamless whole house signal connection) and it works beautifully. Phones and tablets stay well connected to a strong signal throughout my 4 bedroom home. Zero buffering. Great product. Tech support not needed.
1,This Asus AC66U B1 router was purchased as an upgrade to my TP-Link N300 router.  I wanted to improve the wifi signal to the far corners of my house as well as have additional features not available on the TP-Link.  On the plus side the Asus router provided a stronger signal to the far reaches of my house.  But the negatives far outweighed the stronger signal.  First the Asus router consistently dropped the wifi signal--about once every 20 minutes.  In order to re-establish the signal I would have to re-set the router.  This is totally unacceptable.  I spent hours fiddling with the Asus settings but to no avail.  The second issue is that in order to use all of the Asus's features you have to agree to send your browsing history and other private data to them.  This also is unacceptable.  You purchase the router and now you also have to agree to give up your private data to use the features?  Uh no I don't think so.
4,This replaces a router that frequently needed to be rebooted a few times each week. This one hasn’t had that problem.
4,Performance has been good. Range is improved over the old Linksys router that it replaced. It has crashed a few times hence the star deduction but overall I'm very pleased.
5,Easy to set up out of the box
1,I recently realized that my wireless router was outdated and so i decided to replace it. I went with this router based on a friend's recommendation. Setup was easy and had my new network up in 30 minutes. Once the router was online I noticed that my two laptops would continuously lose the connection to the internet. This only happened to the computers because my two TV's worked fine. The wired connection to my laptops also worked without any problems. I updated the firmware and reset the routed twice. The dropped connections continued. I'm a webmaster and a SharePoint Administration at work so I'm familiar with network protocols and requirements. I felt that I should not have to continue my troubleshooting on a new router so i returned it. While connected my speed did increase from 23mbs to 100mbs so there is that. I don't know if my experience is indicative of a wide spread problem with these routers but the inability to maintain a consistent internet connection was the finale straw for me.
5,Great product it works just like it needs to work
5,Works as advertised. Getting good internet speeds. It will pop up as 2 APNs. Browser based configuration. Took me all of 5 minutes to set it up. Make sure you use Google's DNS addresses to speed up browsing and make it slightly safer.
5,Easy to set up and I get better WiFi on my second floor than I did with my Belkin router. I bought this as it was recommended by my new fiber optic internet provider. No problems at all.
5,I was having a problem with my older router - website connections wouldn't connect or would drop as soon as I connected to the website!  Very frustrating.  My son recommended ASUS and specifically asked me to order it from Amazon because the price was better.  One of the best purchases I've made!
5,Easy to set up. Great connection.
2,I purchased this Asus router to replace an existing one from another manufacturer. My old router was an AC dual band just like this one and was in the same price range. I set the Asus up in exactly the same location as my old router. I live in a 1500sq ft single story home w/basement. Unfortunately I now have WiFi dead zones in the basement where none existed before. My iPhone switches to LTE my basement streaming blue-ray player cannot connect to WiFi. I don’t live in a giant home. The Asus’ lack of range on 2.4GHz  is very disappointing 5GHz which characteristically has even less range is essentially useless. Based on my experiences I cannot recommend this product.
4,No issues but the range could be a little better. (800sqft apartment weak connection in bedroom)Very reliably though!
5,Does what it says it will do! I had an issue that I caused and called their support and the issue was resolved in minutes.
5,Wow this totally changed my wi-fi environment. Alexa multi-room system works now it delivers to all corners of my house and I've been clocking 140 Mbps on our cable service. Our smart TV actually works now. Sweet.
5,Muy rapido el envio a Colombia tan solo gasto 3 dias el router funciona bestial para el precio MUY RECOMENDADO
3,Thought the wifi reach would be better. Delivers the speed promised by the ISP.
3,Port forwarding does not work. Also use the Merlin Firmware and the RT-AC68U version to update this router. Asus firmware is garbage. Other than that it seems to be holding up well. I have not used the 5Ghz band yet so I am unsure how long it will last when those circuits are cranking away and creating more heat inside of the unit.
5,Great signal strength and getting speeds I'm supposed to get. This model is capable of mesh network with compatible second router. Currently have 15 devices connected to the network. No issues after over a year now.
5,It is my opinion that this ASUS AC1750 Router is one of the best on the market with good solid reliable WIFI signal with lots of range.  It was simple and easy to install using the straight forward instruction that come with the unit.  I am very happy with this router.Robert
1,I would give this zero stars if I could.  It appears sometime in the past few years Asus started locking their routers down so that they only work with Asus firmware (or AsusWRT-Merlin).  I specifically need the capabilities of DD-WRT firmware which these routers are no longer able to run (unless you converted over prior to them being locked down).I am an IT pro with over two decades of experience.  I've been using Asus routers running DD-WRT firmware in both personal and professional settings for years.  I tried every posted process for changing the firmware unfortunately none of them work since the Asus lockout.  See attached photo for reference.  I cannot recommend this model and will be returning it.
5,works easy set up
1,This router is amazing if you set it up and NEVER TOUCH IT AGAIN.  I made the mistake of updating the firmware - feels like a generally prudent idea when it comes to electronics in the digital age - and spent the remainder of my afternoon paying penance for my hubris.I have not been able to gather a "why" for this issue from ASUS - and given the pandemic I'm sure their customer support is understaffed and overworked so I'm not expecting one - but for some reason if you do decide to update the firmware...YOU HAVE TO FACTORY RESET THE ENTIRE ROUTER AND PROCEED TO SET UP YOUR HOME NETWORK AND REPAIR YOUR DEVICES.Buyer be warned - buy it set it up and never touch it again.  Works great as long as you don't change it from the out-of-the-box state.
5,Works well
5,Setting up with aimesh took a little while and had to step me main router firmware back a version to get it to setup. Then upgraded the firmware after and is working fine now.
4,Wi-Fi range was weak especially with ethernet traffic happening simultaneously
5,Great router. Overall the signal travels further and wireless devices receive the signal faster than my previous router.
5,Super fast setup and great speeds.  We’ve connected over 100 devices at church with multiple other access points and this device hasn’t glitched yet.Best part is Asus routers are not affected by the recent router hack other brands are facing.
5,Great for imesh I hard wired it to the other side of the house now the whole house has full signal. Your phone just switches to other router as you walk around the house
5,# 3 needed a quick replacement for a Rogue Linksys  put Merlin on it AMTM Skynet Diversion & runs great !!
5,Great router! Easy initial setup. Easy security setup. I loved it so much that I increased my internet speed package so I’d really get to appreciate it. It does get a little warm as it runs so keep it dusted and don’t cover it with desk knick knacks
5,I used to have a Synology router and I replaced it with this product. I'm getting now a better signal quality and speed. Finally I can use the 5GHZ wireless mode without interruption.
5,I have come to really like the ASUS routers. A previous ASUS AC66U bit the dust (under heavy usage for two to three years) and was replaced with this AC1750; all the same features are present in addition the quality of service monitoring is improved. Definitely recommended.
3,Working well with multiple routers however the interface can be a little bit overwhelming for non tech savvy users. Not as user friendly as other brands. But like I said they work well.
5,Using this as an access point for our wireless in the company and it was very easy setup and range is great and reliable.
4,Works great for my needs in my apartment. I can receive a strong and clear signal through 2 floors.
5,Quick and easy set-up used this to replace my Cincinnati Bell Fioptics gateway router since I only have internet through them. Have full bars in every room and triple the speed.  Also this is endlessly customizable.
3,Item being sold as new when its been opened.
5,Asus makes the best routers especially since the Merlin software adds so many more capabilities. Love the Access-point mode so it can serve as a smart switch and wifi access point without having to disable all of the DHCP serving stuff manually.
5,Great signal for my office. Better than the last 3 routers. Arrived quickly. No issues. The 5ghz staff network gets 400 Mb to the 'fast' website. Range is fine.
5,Solid performance! Easy to manage! Very solid home / small office router.If your wanting more flexible management and improved policies you can download Merlin WRT and flash the system ROM.
1,I bought this in January as an AIMESH node to pair with my AC-5300 primary router. It's been nothing but problems starting with all wireless clients dropping for no reason at all and several errors being logged in the system log. So I call support. They say resetting to factory defaults will fix the problem. So I do that (forget I had to spend another 1.5 hours setting up my config again) same result. They've released several firmware updates for both routers since (most recent yesterday) and it STILL isn't working. If you think this is an isolated problem go check their support page for this router and look at all the firmware updates. STILL not fixed yet their support won't acknowledge there's a problem. Currently I cant pair this router with my AC5300 it errors out. So I've got about $500 worth of Asus routers I wish they'd give my money back and I could purchase products that WORK.
5,Not being very tech-savy it was a bit of a stretch for me to get this set up. Also most of my devices are not on the .ac wireless but within the year I'll upgrade. But after installing I have to admit the router has been great.
5,These are great for home or small businesses that don't need excess features like you'd get from a SonicWall or something.Advanced users should look into the Merlin firmware for these and other Asus models they really add more features and are reliable and solid.
5,My previous router kept slowing down had to reboot every two weeks. This router holds speeds has an abundance of configurable settings and ranges great for a medium sized home.
1,This does not communicate with ARRIS Modem SB8200.  This is new Modem and this has two 1-Gigabit Ethernet Ports.  I was so existed to increase my WiFi speed from 200 Mbps to 600 Mbps which X finite offers to me now.However ASUS RT-AC66U B1 AC1750 Dual-Band WiFi Router did not communicate with new Modem.  I spent a week with ASUS customer technical support but they did not find any solution.  They told me to re-set the router to factor set up and I performed couple times.  I returned the initial unit and got the replacement.  However the replacement did not work too.  I do not know what was the root cause of failure but it did not work with my Modem.
5,Works well in a 2500 Square foot home. Easy setup and easy to follow instructions. We operate about 18 devices and there is plenty of band width to handle more.
5,love it. Less wifi disconnections
5,Got a nice little boost upgrading from the AC900 to the AC1750 my WiFi connection went from 300Mbps to 867Mbps and my internet speed test got a bit better now get 240Mbps over wireless! Pretty good make sure you upgrade firmware and Asuswrt-Merlin is pretty nice.
5,Took me about 1  hour from unpacking to fully configuring my new router. I had no problem following the included Quick Start Guide. If you don't follow instructions then don't include complaints in your reviews.
5,Great value for the money. Decent range. Was getting about 50 Mbps on my old router. This was was hitting closer to 90. Very happy with the purchase. Easy to setup also.
1,signal is weak. constantly dropping and reboot.
5,It was easy to set up.
5,Love the new router and all the new features of a more modern router. Was easy to set up and configure. Wish I had upgraded long time ago.
5,Exelente calidad  full recomendado
5,This router proved more reliable than a WRT1900 AC LinkSys.  Has not lost signal or recycled to drop signal like linksys.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for easy set-up and compatible with various repeaters for large areas with wall obstruction for wireless.  Great product!
4,Compared to other brands I've used this router series is my go-to equipment for home networking.
5,Bought this after I realized that my new Charter/TW router had next to no features.This router offers everything a network engineer like myself will need at home.
5,Excellent router haven't had a single issue and the AI Security software is great! Easy to set up excellent range even on 5GHz band.
5,I have two of these one set as a router and the other hardwired to it as an access point so as to have excellent wi-fi coverage around the house.  They are easy to configure. No problems at all.
5,Perfect router to suit my media/gaming needs. Has great moderate QoS settings to really help control traffic. Really love all the settings and the UI. It's fast and sustainable.Honestly as an IT guy I couldn't be happier with this router.
5,This is a simple 1-2-3 type set -up and the unit functions very well. I substituted this for a service provider's router and it works so much better!
4,pretty great router  nothing much to complain about unless you have specific needs or your networking set up is complicated.
5,Works as intended for our AIMesh system
5,Doubled my speed from old unit.
4,I saw someone say these were counterfeit but mine registered just fine. It’s great tho for $70 (was on sale) probably the best router for the money.The 2.4ghz is faster than my older routers 2.4 by almost double (I’m an getting 100mbs on 2.4 now)And the 5ghz is easily getting my full net speed of 300mbsI subtracted 1 star because one of the antennas were very wobbly and wouldn’t stay up on its own. When I went to look at it more closely the antenna just snapped. The wire was still intact tho so I knew it would work just fine and taped it in place. I don’t wanna RMA for something duct tape can fix.Would still recommend this router to anyone wanting a cheap wifi6 802.11ax tho. It’s a steal at that price.
5,using this router for my tv and games on the computer.  the computer is a lot faster with this router and isp greenlight.  no errors so far
1,ASUS Router drops my two HP wifi printers after appx an hour. Prior to the installation of the ASUS Router the printers worked perfectly with the Actiontec router from Century Link. ASUS tech support was completely unhelpful suggesting the use of LEGACY which did nothing but slowed performance and selecting channel 11 which also did nothing to resolve the issue. I resolved this issue when I discovered WAKE ON LAN. The second issue occurred several months in. One of the pcs on my network which uses ethernet reported that it was on a WIFI network which is impossible. Windows networking stopped working too.The third issue occurred later when the units connected thru this router stopped finding the DSL modem.It will be a cold day in ..... when I buy another ASUS product.One year later this product continues to disappoint. The only reason I keep it is so my handyman has access to private wifi.
1,I just bought this router. Got the router set-up but could not get to the log-in setup. Went to their online support Live-Chat. Heather said she would have someone call me within 5 minutes to help with the set-up. Got the call and had discussion with the tech. He wanted to go into my computer which I thought would be ok. After looking around in my computer for awhile he says that there are ip addresses that need to be removed before we could do the set-up. At a cost o $129.00! I asked him if this was from ASUS suppport and he said yes.  Doesn't sound right o me so I said no I did not want it. He sdaid that was my choice and left my computer. Is this the support I can expect from ASUS?
5,great wifi router
3,Good basic router for most homes. Supports enough features for most home users and enough for some power users to get by.
3,This is a great wireless router BUT. It died at 1 yr and one month of use. Not my usual experience with an ASUS product. Their customer service website is a nightmare ....  Let's see how this works out
4,This model has a good reputation. This refurb seems fine so far. Time will tell.
3,Product was defective and had to be returned.  A replacement was shipped immediately.  However the larger problem was the support call center obviously not located in the US.  The "technician" lacked sufficient English skills to deal with the problem although he did finally determine the original unit was defective.
1,AiMesh didn’t work. The devices simply don’t connect to router which created a useless WiFi black hole in the middle of my house. Waste of money.
5,VERY nice router and good range in our home.  FW is kept updated by ASUS and there are plenty of features to control what the kids or grandkids are getting into or viewing.
5,Really nicer that me last one can reach all the way to back of a 1/3 acre
5,it was very easy to set up and the admin page is easy to navigate was able to set up express vpn too in a few minutes
5,I was having some issues playing online games with lag and loss of connection even when the internet showed connected.  I replaced my old and less costly router with this one.  Issues solved.  I'd recommend it.
5,Perfect router! Much better than the cheap Linksys or ASUS.This is the only router that works well as a repeater for me!
5,Hardy well built great signal and amazing features. The built in VPN client and tunnel functionality is awesome. Really like the update QoS functions as well as the traffic analyzer. Really great product for not a lot of money.
5,As described.
5,I was skeptical about buying this router. As soon as I hooked this bad boy up it not only worked but it boosted my wifi signal around the house. Now my home network can handle everything we throw at it.
4,Works acceptable. I was hoping for better coverage at the far end of my house. Works about as well as my old router.
5,Super easy set up great performance thus far.
5,got it set it up now working like a charm
3,Didn't really increase my Wi-Fi flow or coverage much. The three prong antenna is nice. It's just not what I thought it would be or do. Especially disgruntled with the firmware but at least it's a dual band router. My old one wasn't.
5,Much better than what the cable company provided. Plus the features in the app is prepares me when the kids get more devices when they are older. Block devices my profile? Awesome!
4,Good quality this is the second one I have purchased.  Unfortunately the antennas are no longer detachable but that's a minor issue.
5,Old reliable died didn't hesitate to replace with exact same model.
5,Much Faster than the one my service provider was leasing to me. Love it
1,Router worked like a charm for the first few hours. Just got finished adjusting the parental controls and it quit working. Lights all said it had a connection but devices said no internet past the router. Tried everything I knew to do and got nowhere.Tried to call customer service. Big.Fat.Nope. Call center is down due to Corona virus-use their online chat. "Online chat" is an endless hellish loop of FAQs that go absolutely nowhere. You absolutely cannot connect to a human under any circumstances.I'm giving myself 24 hours to try again and then this will be returned never to buy this brand again. This is the 2nd router of the same kind to quit working in under 45 days.
1,I've had this router for 3 months. It worked great for the first month. Then it started to drop wireless connections. Then it started to drop wired connections. Reboot reset re-flash firmware. Stand on one foot. Jump up and down. Bark like a dog. Nothing...If calling customer support and having to repeat everything three times and having EVERY WORD YOU SAY repeated back to you by someone who speaks English as a second language is your thing THIS ROUTER IS FOR YOU!  I know I know some people gave this router 5 stars. Well they are the lucky 50%. Look at the ratings. I made this amateur mistake myself when I purchased this on impulse.I'm pretty sure I'll never buy ASUS again. I suggest you avoid this as well.
4,Works great with some tweaks. Asus support was good. Good price for the capabilities.
5,Solid no issues I’ve been using it for a month
5,Arrived quickly and the setup was very easy. Have been using it for over a year now and have had no problems at all.
1,Had great reviews and just didn't preform.  Contacted Asus product support line and they tried to fix with poor results.  Paying for 600Mbps and only able to top around 100Mbps wireless.  Yes the unit was in the next room not across the home.  I would have expected more.  Very disappointed.  Amazon was kind enough to allow a return.  Asus wanted us to ship back at our expense and wait up to 2 months for it to be returned thus leaving us with out internet.  Not acceptable when working from home.  So goodby Asus.  Never again!!
1,So we just bought 200mbps xfinity and I set it all up with two of these routers for aimesh. So once it was all setup I tested the speeds and they were both at 200 so then a couple hours later I went on my pc with the node connected to it and it said anywhere from 2 to 60 mbps depending on i don’t know. So I rebooted it I unplugged it I messed with the settings and no matter what I did the signal was still terrible. Idk what to do at this point but I might return it or try and reboot it to factory settings or something.
5,It has a bigger foot print than my old router but installation was trouble free.  Performance is good in a two story house.  The next test:  How long will it last?
2,Wireless 5ghz started disconnecting randomly after 4 months. Working from home became difficult from disconnecting every 30 minutes. I am an IT tech and after troubleshooting it appears it's the wireless chip. I also made sure to have latest firmware. I don't recommend this for a reliable home router long term if you decide based on my unfortunate experience
5,Easy to set up. And my WiFi signal now is great thanks to this great find!!! Fast delivery and free shipping!!
5,Bought this to use  as a aimesh node to work with my 86u Works well.
5,just what i needed to pay one time for a great product. not a monthly rental great investment. now my internet is at the speed i pay for every month
5,Great upgrade from my Cisco E1000. Our 1600 sq ft house has full bars everywhere despite going through a few walls on all bands. QOS works a treat and we have had no problems since purchasing.
5,I was pleasantly surprised by how much stronger my signal was with this ASUS as opposed to my older Belkin.  Set up was quick and easy.  My Wi-Fi signal improved dramatically throughout my house.
5,I use this as a mesh node.  It's pretty much the cheapest ASUS router that will still run VPN and AiMesh.
1,Super happy initially with this Asus AC-RT66U B1 router but then it did all of a sudden this past week. I bought it in February 2019 and it is now October 2019 so this router lasted only 8 months. Trying to get Asus support is impossible. Their chat isn't working and the call center keeps dropping calls. The RMA process is absolutely terrifying in that you can't get anything to work. In other words I am out of $140 and will never buy from Asus again. I was about to spend $1400 on a new Asus motherboard and graphics cards which I am not going to do anymore after this poor experience. Asus you used to be great but no more.
5,I get signal 30 to 50 feet outside my house with full bars!  Even at work we have one and I can get signal 20 feet away outside of a block wall with Huge overhead metal doors!
1,this thing has never worked well. it drops devices that are connected and is completely unreliable for videoconferencing and at home learning. i had to connect the tv to the wireless cable modem so we could stream video smoothly. i would not recommend. the interface is slick but it's not worth the hassle when i have my kids texting me on school days every few minutes to let me know they're zoom dropped or they can't stream a video they need to watch.
5,Very reliable fast over Ethernet with no lag spikes at all
4,Great functionality however I can't upgrade to DD-WRT it refused to take any other firmware.
5,Been using it for about 6 months and no problems.  Range reaches the entire home.
5,I'm not a tech geek but I had this set up and running in an hour with 1 call to my ISP.  Working like a charm.  Glad I went this route and replaced ISP router.
5,It fast and my connection is stable. Can't ask for more especially at a good price point. I hardwire to the router for gaming but this handles a wifi netflix stream flawlessly.
5,Had to call tech support to set it up but learned a lot. You need to change the default DNS to another one but again I leaned a lot. Works great now! Very happy!
1,So my router's WAN port failed after 10 months of use. No big deal. Right? RIGHT? Contacted ASUS support who want me to ship the router AT MY EXPENSE. How much? $27. Madness. And in the interim they just expect people to live without internet in 2021. How lovely and thoughtful....NOT. I love ASUS routers and the capabilities they offer but I probably will not order another one again after this mess.
5,I recently updated my cable modem but wasn’t getting significantly faster speed via wifi… so despite flawless performance from my decade old Apple AirPort Extreme I finally decided to upgrade my router too. Connection speed practically doubled — I was maxing out at 270 Mbps on wifi but now get around 700 via Ethernet and around 500 Mbps wifi to phone tablet Apple TV and laptop.  So far there have been no dropouts and I haven’t had to reboot since installing. The software took some time to get used to since I’ve only been using airport utility previously. There are a lot of options! It seems quite easy to understand and there is an app and a web interface.  Currently I’m using it with an Arris s30 cable modem and things seem fine. I used to get fairly good speed with 5ghz band but pitiful speed on the  2.4 band — now the latter is respectable tho still slower. . I may add a guest network where I can isolate things like wifi lightbulbs Alexa etc  I am running about 15 wifi connectable devices tho rarely all at the same time. Still fiddling with settings and antenna placement but I’m pleased with the performance and glad I made the switch. I haven’t figured out how to add a usb drive for time machine style computer backup yet … the airport was much easier to set up … but it’s on my to do list…  Wifi seems steady and I like having an extra USB port + Ethernet ports. Despite some reservations about how well it would play with my Apple hardware I’ve run into no difficulties so far. My computer is pretty old so I didn’t think I needed anything faster … I hope this router lasts a few years and continues to provide reliable wifi. So far… so good. Recommended.
5,Wow easy set up lots of feature (that actually work) best home router I have had.I have kids and this makes it very easy to restrict internet time and content.
1,I had some difficulty setting this router up.  I called tech support and they wanted $140 to "update software".  I have a new computer the router is brand new and my fire stick isn't very old.  I didn't fall for this ploy to rip me off and after resetting the router I found the problem in the initial set-up.  I hate that I had to experiment with "passwords" to find something that would work.  I guess telling you what they are wanting is to easy.  I finally resolved the problem myself and it is working as it should so far.  Since the Asus tech tried to rip me off I would never buy another Asus product.
5,Excellent Router at this price.  Setup was easy as I have setup many routers.If you are not experienced call a friend.Range is good for Wi-Fi.  Saw a big increase in speed.
3,Dropped package and lag
1,This died after 1 year just after its warranty ran out.
5,Easy to set up gives good coverage and great speed.
5,Great Router! Easy set-up and works with multiple Xbox consoles (for those with NAT Issues) - Make sure your WiFi Network Card in laptop is a newer one :) Or you'll have to upgrade it :)
5,Plugged it in minimal setup of network names and passwords and go.
1,I bought this router because Nord recommended it for easy integration into their VPN system. I hope they'll check it out 1 more time before recommending it again. I have installed dozens of routers and have never had the issues that I had with this one. I spent 2 days after work screwing around with this unit. One minute it would seem like it was going to work and then it messed up again. I finally got fed up with it and returned it via Amazon. May be it was just a defective unit but for the money I paid for it I didn't expect the hassle. I'll keep looking but I doubt I'll ever order another ASUS.
5,Easy set up and use with Greenlight!
5,Pretty simple to setup.  Had to do a hard reset after firmware update but it works great after.
1,I purchased 3 AC-66U and updated the firmware with the inrent to setup AiMesh.  The first two worked great.  After a couple of days I figured out you could have 1 AiMesh router and 1 node.  I was able to alternate setting up each of the routers as an AiMesh router and then a node so each of them were functioning.  The problem remained once an AiMesh node was added no other nodes could be added.  While I was setting this up each device was in my office within 3 meters of each other.  I ended up returning the devices since they didn't work as advertised.
5,Easy to set up and install on all my devices
5,This was installed for Everywhere Wireless in Chicago. Works great.Most of the ASUS brand routers similar to this work great. I have a N66U set up as well.
1,Purchased this router in hopes it would help us get the most our of our Internet service. It was easy to install and seemed to work pretty well for about a month. After it was too late to return it the router started going down for a few minutes periodically for no reason. We started receiving popup messages stating that the router was losing contact with the modem. The router would also lose contact frequently with our WiFi printer. I tried rebooting the router a few times with no change. After getting very frustrated with the constant interruption in service I finally disconnected it and reinstalled our old Netgear router. Will stick with it for now as it works MUCH better. I do not recommend the ASUS router!!
4,It has been working flawlessly since I've installed it. So far so good
5,I have this router for a year and it has never let me down. I plan to buy another.
5,Just what we needed. Our computer guru had recommended it the price was reasonable it was delivered asap and is working just as we hoped.
5,This router works great for gaming. I tried the nighthawk from net gear and despite all the rave reviews it was terrible for gaming. I'm very happy with this one
5,Increased Range & Multiple Speed options 2 & 5...Able to seporate from other WiFi interference in my office complex and home office vs Home WiFi.
5,Works well.  I'm not sure how it might be better than others but my building has more than 200 networks and this never fails.
5,Runs better than I hoped! Have two TV streaming HD quality on PlayStation Vue with 155 mbps cable modem. Was able to ditch cable seemlessly with this router.
5,Works great. Paired with Netgear cm1000 modem internet speeds easily hit my ISP's max 250 mgb speed.
5,Excellent range and very good user interface.  Have run this router for years.
1,Router had a great signal but was not able to complete setup.  Setup instruction sheet consisted of one piece of paper.  Setup sheet referred to manual if unable to complete setup.  Manual was not included in box.  Setup sheet also referred you to ASUS website for support.  Support page address did not exist.  When I went to ASUS main website for support I was unable to reach a support page for the router.  Finally called the help center.  Navigated through the prompts and call went answered.  Poor customer support all the way around.  Will return router to amazon.
4,great router for the price
4,Works as advertised.
5,Love it. No complaints at all. Been using this for maybe a year now? Still working like it's supposed to.
5,Great product. Speeds are great. Great range but ended up ordering another to cover my whole house.
4,I think it has performed as expected without true high speed internet.
4,great
5,Replaced an existing router.  Install and configure was very easy.  Great throughput.  Fast and reliable for home network use.  No complaints at all!
2,I am on my second unit of this router and I have not been able to figure out why I keep getting constant wireless drops on the 2.4 GHz network.I have tried inputting specific settings for the wireless channel number for the frequency band and none of those stabilize the connections. I would recommend going with another router.
4,fine
5,This is a Rock Solid router! Easy to set up and manage. The web interface is great! No complaints after several months of use!
5,So far works great.  Quick ....(faster than the old 2.4). Easy to set up.
4,Set up in less than 20 minutes. Works OK so far.
4,works well.
1,Up date ASUS promised to send a new/rebuilt unit so we could return our unit for repair.  ASUS said there would be a 2 week delay due to stock problems. 6 weeks latter and nothing. I've had to buy a new unit because the ASUS router was off line at least 25% of the time (Google Nest works great). ASUS is not responding to our emails NFG.
4,Very good but a litte expensive
5,This router works great. Interface is the most friendly one that I have use to date. Easy set-up. Not much more to say. :)
5,Works great much faster WiFi!!
5,Good router.  We got improved wifi in areas of the house that previously had nothing.  Signal is stronger and more reliable.
5,Very pleased with the improvement of our wifi signal. Very stable now compared to before. Easy setup quality product. Thank you
5,Works great!! Easy set up. no issues at all. Much better than the netgear that i returned.
4,Does exactly what we expected
1,I used this router for three days and had awful packet loss the entire time.  I went into the web interface to try to trouble shoot and hit the reboot button and ever since then the WI Fi bands don't turn on the router and I cannot connect to it.  It's a $100 worthless brick.  Don't waste your money on this.
5,Excellent works fine with vpn
5,Great signal and it’s reliable - several months of consistant signal.
5,I had a little trouble setting it up. Other than that it works very well. No problems so far. It is alot faster than my last router.
5,Easy to use software quick set up. Lots of features no down time. Recommend!
5,This router doesn't decrease the signal from the modem as others do. Stream download all of it... is top notch
1,I have a fairly complex network at home with ipads amazon fire roku 3 computers 10 home automation network devices 2 amazon echos.  After trying to replace a failed netgear dual band router by changing ssid and passwords to the old network parameters.  I tried to reconnect with some success however each device had to be relogged into the router.  The final straw was when I couldn't get my computer to connect to the wireless printer.  I called their support with no success to resolution to the problem they just took notes and really didn't have any other suggestions. I am going back to a netgear router even though the one I had failed after only a year.
4,Please with router.  Works great.
5,My wifi is faster and the setup was a breeze
5,This item was recommended by my network administrator for home use.  He was right.  Easy install and worked right the first time!
5,Well protected packaged and delivered on time. Simple setup and instructions for operation. Works very well throughout my home and nearby outside the home. Great product os far!
5,Very good buy it am.very happy  with my new router and I got  no loss of signal and speed up.and running all times
1,I bought on AMAZON recommendation---quit working after 3 months---after two hours on ASUS product support I learn this router will need to be updated every 3-4 months and no notices will be sent---never mentioned in product info or amazon REC---I tried update with ASUS rep---he would stay with me until finished said all would be ok---NOT---download froze---  So I called my cable company and the next day they installed the same power router---for free---  If you're like me---need internet working all the time---don't buy this router despite AMAZON rec---not user friendly and poor product support----and since I didn't know of the problems until after Amazon's return policy....can't return....not good business model here.
5,Very easy to install
4,Works as advertised.
1,After getting this router and having it work fine for about a month it sh*t the bed. Wireless constantly drops does not stay connected. To provide insight: I do work as a IT tech so I have the firmware updated have rebooted the wired connection works just fine. STAY AWAY!!! There are really good reviews however if you value having your wireless up and running 24/7 I would advise looking elsewhere.
5,I havent had to reset this thing once.
2,We have used this router before.  After 5 years the on/off switch failed. We re-ordered the exact model number and the new one doesn't have removable antenna's.  We have to utilize an external antenna that is not attachable to this new model.  Also it appears that Amazon is not allowing me to return it at this time.
2,Seems to be a problem that Asus can't fix. You can get into the setting only after a reboot. Reports go back to 2016. I set it up and tried to get backto check some settings. Can not get back in although it seems to be working. People have tried other firmware but I am not that brave.When it first booted up it got new firmware so the problem wasn't fixed.
5,Very fast and awesome range for the money. Setup couldn't have been easier. It looks good as well not that it really matters.
5,Outstanding fixed all my problems. And extremely easy to install.
5,Complete control of the router.  The GUI is intuitive and easy to navigate.  Phenomenal
5,Easy set up
5,serves it's purpose - only time will tell
5,For the price its hard to beat
4,Working great so far.
5,Muy buen producto buena señal y es estable
5,Only had it a shot time but it works amazingly well.. The app offers easy to access controls over your wifi and internet.
5,Very good value for this router. It has a lot features and the apps is better than I expected.
5,So far so good with it. Needed this to get Greenlight internet in my area.
1,We ordered this product looking to upgrade our wifi router and we were extremely disappointed and irritated.  After going to all the trouble to call our internet service and have a new router installed it doesnt even come close to the router we had before!!  We read alot of online reviews and thought this product and this company would fill our need.  We were sadly mistaken!  No wifi service on our porch or even in places inside our home and we do not live in a large  home!!  We would like a full refund!!!
5,Excellent Router High speed routing of our normal basic plan. Easy set up for PC Laptop and two phones. Solid reliable connections.
5,No lack of expectations.  A good product.  Good wireless visibility throughout a decent sized house.  Less Lag than the netgear I was replacing.
5,Provides excellent signal is easy to use and has most every option you could want.
5,This works very well and is certainly a great improvement over my old router!
4,Great Value
1,Literally worst router I’ve ever tried to setup. I have a ASUS ac5300 and set this up as a ainode. Signal was always sketchy and it caused whole network issues. Also when resetting and trying to use as a wireless bridge would not re-establish communication and would actually drag main router signal. This was a mess. I have a Apple time capsule alongside my ac5300 with no issues. This router SUCKS.
1,I actually returned one and got another.  Tried to extend existing 2.4G and 5G networks about 25 feet.  Lots of technical problems.  Spent many hours with first line support without getting the problem resolved.  Asked for them to escalate the issue but that never happened.  Given that I have two other Asus routers one of which I was trying to extend expected better support.  Gave up.
5,It is a great product easy to install and configure
1,This thing was all sorts of messed up. After plugging it in only the 5g light came on the router the 2.4 did not.  The only SSID name I could connect to said "2g" but it was actually the 5g signal. I updated the firmware and reset it but still had the same issue. I bought a tp link router instead and it's working perfectly. I will have to return this one.
5,Hasn’t dropped connection once and keeps good speed. Would recommend
4,great
5,Blazing fast with our great internet service that have here in my home town.
4,I like I like
5,Excellent as a mesh node!
1,I was unable to even use the router. It is NOT user friendly and when I called for tech support the phone just rung with NO answer. I should have listen to the other reviews but I figured since I set up our last one that this one would be just as simple. Well looks simple but does not give ANY instructions for when you run into problems!! Hope this can be returned because I plan to send back immediately! You should go with another one unless you have a background in tech support.
1,Garbage
1,Installed for three months now -This was a huge improvement to my home network. I have multiple devices online at any given moment many of them streaming and my old hardware just couldn’t handle the bandwidth. This device has no problem and the first month was great.  Now I have to reset it daily sometimes numerous times daily. I even recommended it to my friend :-/I’ve reached out to Asus support and can’t even get a response. Very disappointed.
1,I bought this router to use in the AIMesh system.  It won't stay online.  And now it won't connect to broadband at all.  I bought the ac68U to take its place.  If it's bad I'm done with Acer for good.  Two out of three routers I have from them are bricks.  This one is going into the landfill.
5,Put Merlin firmware on this router.  Works great.  Improved signal strength in our apartment over our old N600.
1,This appears to be a fault with this routers. Bought this router little over a year ago. Incoming internet port died with out a cause. Liked the router so much decided to buy the same model again. Got the router on 7/15. Incoming internet port died on 7/20. The router is great while it works but seems to have a common failure. I don't recommend this router. I am returning the defective router and will buying another brand.
5,Router works great 24/7
5,Solid performance and great range!  Make sure and update the firmware right out of tht gate but thus far no problems...
1,ASUS is not the brand to buy. Couldn't register the unit. Called support got some dude in India who spoke little understandable English. Handed off to another Indian who gave me a phone number to call. Called and this person wanted to sell me $150.00 puter fix. Nothing wrong with my puter and still no help. I've gone back to my old Belkin to get by on but it's failing. ASUS product support is non existent. How do I get back the payment for extended warranty I purchased for this product?
5,This router has worked flawlessly and allows full use of our high speed internet.
5,Things a beast. Fast internet easy to set up tons of control. Hooked up a hard drive to it I can stream movies from it.
5,One of the best home units
5,Dependable router with lots of features. I like being able to USB tether my Android phone.
5,A real work horse and includes a VPN which is valuable for security when using open WiFi networks.
1,I ordered this router for a customer. Installed it and had to reprogram it twice. the Owners laptop kept dropping off the wifi network. We reinstalled his old router.I left this on the shelf for a few months and had an opportunity to install it at another location to replace an old linksys.Once again the unit would not configure or work properly. Its past any return thru amazon so i believe this one is going into the trash bin. Very disappointed as other ASUS routers we have used in the past were awesome.
1,This router is not even remotely worth the amount of money I spent on it. Maybe I got a dud I don't know but it seemed fine during the return period. Literally as soon as the return window closed I have had nothing but problems. I have flashed DD-wrt and Tomato to see if it was firmware related but the same issue happens across both.
4,I can't really tell if this router is faster or better than the Asus AC1750 I had before. They both work right and were easily set up.  I have a new laptop that did recognize the WiFi 6 right off. Look for a good sale price mine was <$65.
5,Excellent range and bandwidth much better than the all in one motorola modem/wifi router I replaced. Easily configured.
5,It worked as intended.
5,Fantastic router! So much faster than what charter gives you. Easy to set up VPN already recommended to friends and family!
1,It took hours to get this thing set up as an AIMESH node only for it to completely disappear from the network upon rebooting the router. If you get this set up you will have to go through the painfully long set up process every time you reboot your router. Completely unacceptable.
1,Initially I was impressed with the signal quality and thruput. The web interface was nice as was the tools.But all that was short lived after 24 hours when I noticed many of the devices connected were being dropped.I went over to the router and it was quite hot as was the power cube. After letting it cool down I restarted it  and after another hour it was hot and dropping connections.Too bad I thought it had potential . Went back to my flashed Linksys WRT-1200AC
5,Easy install. Good range
5,We are very pleased with product we can be a floor above and still have very good reception!
5,Improved the range and quality of my wifi experience
5,Great router. Range is excellent in and around the outside of my house. And fast data transfer speeds
5,Excelente producto cumplió mis expectativas.
5,i love this and being able to control what usage is going where is great
5,Super router. Get it.
5,It works so well I forget it is even there. That's what you want right?
5,Super fast with no drop offs or lag. Well worth the money!
1,I bought this as an "upgrade" from a wireless n router to act as a media bridge. Its unreliable it will randomly stop connecting ethernet devices to my main router despite my phone being connected by wifi and the routers own configuration page saying its connected. I had this same problem with the original router I had and it's replacement so it's a design flaw. Asus customer service is completely worthless they can't even understand the problem.
1,Really odd that this would not recognize my Ethernet connection to my computer It wanted to run on WiFi only and would not allow more than 2 devices on at any time. Did several attempts at changing settings with no resolution. Did a reset and tried the ASUS support number and had no response after 15 minutes of being on hold. Installed a Linksys  EA7300 and after about a 15 minute setup i was up and running.
1,I've had this less than six months and it repeatedly drops connection. I have 1G service in Seattle. Thought it was my internet provider but after three visits from them they said it must be the router. When I plug directly into the wall I get connection even after router drops connection. Very displeased with this product. I've tried troubleshooting updates and emails with ASUS engineers. They refuse to refund. Probably won't shop with ASUS routers again.
1,These are the most unstable pieces of junk you can imagine. I've been through three of them in four months all due to the same issue. At random the connection will drop and there's no getting it back until the router decides to let you. I've updated these reset them kicked them across the room but nothing fixes such a flawed design.
5,Works great. huge boost in speed across my devices. Replaced a Apple Time Capsule.
5,It was so simple - and works like a charm.  Very happy.
2,The Asus Router does not have a way to switch off the wireless connection when it is attached to a wired network. There are no internal software switches and there are no external buttons to push. Additionally the Asus router's antennas do not unscrew they are affixed to the unit.
5,Best router and management software I have ever owned/used. My $200 Apple airport extreme AC is going in the trash...
5,Great so far.
1,I used this as a wireless AP in my house so I cannot comment about it's actual routing abilities but the Wifi signal was great until it stopped working.  The 5g signal is completely gone and the 2.4 is being spotty.  I was able to get 250mb down over the 2.4 signal on my phone so it was pretty darn fast.  I also can no longer log into the interface to trouble shoot either.
1,I went by the posted reports and purchased this router about two weeks back. While its wireless performance was good in close quarters (i.e. less than 25 ft) as soon as I walked over to the next room or upstairs or to the basement signal strength fell precipitously to the point that an iPhone would switch over to LTE. After the umpteenth request by family members to revert to the older router I gave in and we are back to the good ole TP-Link. which is a dog in terms of performance but the reach is much better.
1,This router was promising. However after 2 months it broke on me. I should have heeded the other reviews. It no longer will connect to the internet. All I have been doing was working from home over a VPN while my kids watch Netflix/Hulu and my wife does social media. This thing is low quality junk. It worked well when it worked. But it doesn’t last.
5,Very good router and wifi and the Asus control panel works very well.
5,Super easy to set up and gives us perfect range throughout our 1300' condo.
3,Easy to set up good coverage and no dead spots.
1,I received a "new" router however when I set it up the router still had configurations from the previous owner.  This item was obviously a return and being sold as new.
1,I had high expectations for my new WiFi router until I was unable to get any support from the company and then the item went back for a refund. I needed help with setup to work with my ISP.
5,Works great. We supply wi fi in rental units. Easy to setup
5,works great but remember to reboot everything connected to it or they will argue with you
5,Good
5,Good range. Small footprint. Stylish looks. Reliable and cheap. You can't beat it.
3,The router was ok at first. Sometimes while I was at work some of my IOT devices complained that internet was unstable  but I thought it was the device being weird.Now every couple hours whatever I'm watching just hitches up for a minute and when I try to check what's up there is no wifi. Like my network just disappears....I got fed up so I later reseting it a couple times with no result I bought a new AI-Mesh enabled router with wifi6 set it up and setup this router as a node in my dead zone next to back yard. When I set it up the system said signal quality was great and worked fine but everyone in a while it just disappears again.... I don't know why but I am done. It's annoying and very frustrating.TLDR: WIFI network turns off every once in a while couple times a day. Reseting didnt help. AiMesh does same.
5,Great unit! I can put complex passwords in it and change them anytime.
5,Great addition for updating my network...
5,Simply works as expected an it does have a good range.
2,Long time Asus customer but finding  that reliability is suffering for some reason now. This router will constantly drop internet connections. Tried every trick I know including changing broadband modem and my D Link switch.
5,So far working very well.
5,Lives up to ASUS' great reputation for broadband routers!
1,Asus router only 9 months old.  Terrible download speed.  After checking with Spectrum problem is router.  You have to be a complete computer nerd to navigate the customer service for Asus. They have worn me out.  i will have to buy new router but will DEFINITELY NOT BE AN ASUS.  I strongly recommend choosing a different wireless company.
5,It's doing what I purchased it to do and I am very happy.
1,SOOO shady to have to find their warranty and STILL not find it!!:1) open their PDF link they say the warranty is at2) WASTE 10 minutes reading the PDF which eventually tells you to go to their website3) Go to their website link which is just a HOME PAGE!4) give upterrible
5,Have set up many Asus routers; have never been disappointed
5,Product is working great and serves its purpose.  I would highly recommend it to others.
5,very very goood!
5,So far so good
5,it seems to be working well
1,Throughput on the USB3.0 ports doesn't go past 30MB/s internally (dd if=/dev/zero | pv | dd of=testfile bs=512 for writing d if=testfile | pv | dd of=/dev/null for reading). Samba speeds are even worse capping at 19MB/s or so. Extremely disappointing as I bought this router for the advertised USB3 port.I have already disabled the "reduce USB3.0" speed option they had enabled by default but it doesn't make a difference. Tests were done using NTFS and HFS+ partitions I am yet to try ext3 partitions will update when I do.
1,Well mine might have came with a life time guarantee also I purchased it on 5/22/19 this is 6/25/19 and it stopped working every time I wanted to access the WiFi I’d have to unplug the Asusand plug back in. So Had to go back to using my old Linksys. Customer service wasn’t of any help my recommendations are to look some place else for electronic’s.
5,works great!!!! I have Everywhere Wireless and this was recommended to me!
5,easy set up works great
1,I tried to use this as a media bridge it worked for 1 hour out of 24 hours I spent 20 hours trying to get this to work on my network it never did and it is the worst piece of junk I could buy I am switching to netgear since asus is pure junk now and there stuff does not work at all they are a scam
5,Really easy set up. Very sleek and fits in my tv stand no problem.
1,amateur networking experience I had had trouble finding the firmware update needed.  The ASUS website page that you login into to setup the router i could not login using the correct default password; compounded by the fact the network was down with not being able to get the firmware.  What does this mean  do your research first locate the firmware before buying and read as many other website problems encountered for using this product--especially if are a novice.  Lastly I would return it--price+no website solutons/troubleshooting tips.
5,Have it located in basement and works for the whole house (ranch).
5,The first time to buy this not test results. Looks good
5,Great addition to my Wi-fi. A little tricky to setup printer sharing though.
5,Strong signals through the house.  Easy to set up.
5,So far so good.
1,Right out of the box router did not power on. It was making squeaking sound. All leds were off.I disconnected it from the wall socked and after some time (10-25 minutes) connected it again - it worked.But when I disconnected and connected it again after initial setup it did not power on again.The problem is intermittent it just sometimes does not power on.
5,Worked great until something newer came out
1,I really loved this router...  I bought it around Feb 2018.  It died on me in August.  It turns on but internet just doesn't work on it anymore.  I tried resetting it and redoing all the settings but it didn't fix it.  Maybe I got a dud but I wouldn't recommend it if it dies this quickly.
5,Great product.  No issues whatsoever.
5,Needed a vpn client router setup is not too easy but works great
5,Works very well. Easy to set up.
5,A great product that definitely improved my download time!
1,My work IT took my computer and sent me a new one only to be hacked again.  I personally hired a security specialist to evaluate the issue.  He found that this unit was the cause.  Damn Russians.
1,Total piece of junk it doesn't work in AP mode the router won't release IP addresses.Upgraded to the last firmware and spent so many hours even with a friend of mine that is a network engineer. It's a shame that asus don't even test their product.
5,working great so fa app works well also.
5,Very good router
1,It’s a piece of junk stopped working 4 months after purchasing. Tried resetting to factory settings refused to work. Buy something else
5,Good job ASUS. This is the best router I have used so far.
5,Awesome. Great range and works! No issues.
1,I purchased a brand new modem instead I received an open box one. With black out in ink areas in the box and security info.
2,Well not totally. It powered on but couldnt sign into the router to change settings or turn on wifi.
5,simply the best modem available for the price range
1,Started out great then went sour. Could not get good signal to my desk tops or laptops but playstation and phones worked great. Called tech support and no help all they recommended was to restart or reboot the router no help.Now I am stuck with this POS.
1,less than a year old and would drop internet connection constantly. replaced it with a netgear no problems all good now.
1,Bought this for the AiMesh functionality.  After two days of trying to set up something that should be very simple I realized the unit sent was not what was listed.  The unit received was the RT-N66U not capable of the AiMesh functionality so prominently touted in the listing.  It’s on its way back.
5,Greatly improved service using this router.
5,Provides great coverage even being placed in the basement.
1,Received a refurbished product despite no mention in the ad. Inserted instructions are cheaply photocopied and include typos and grammar errors that make me doubt this is from ASUS. Beware SCAM
5,Bought it as a gift....they loved it.
1,Tried support wouldn't help. Device kept restarting for no reason checked logs kept it cool. replaced power adapter. I looked online for weeks trying to find a solution. It's too bad I used to think ASUS was a good brand.
5,Great product.  Quick shipping.  Works wonderfully!
5,Works great
5,Works well so far
5,Works well - significant range increase over previous router
5,This router is the best dollar per value there is.
1,Compré este router para reemplazar un tplink archer a7Este asus es una porqueria el Qos no sirve para Nada solo retrasa mas los paquetes no lo recomiendo.
5,Great router fast and the interface is very well designed
5,Excellent Router.
1,So disappointed had only a few months and it is already not working.  Wish I had just purchased at a store so I could return it for being defective.
1,POS. Started out fine but now that I am out of the return window it is perpetually dropping devices and not allowing them to connect.
1,The router worked as expected but after 6 months it gave out cant get connected to it anymore. Very dissapointed that it didnt even last a whole year
5,I mean you can't ask for any more for this price especially for a good wifi 6 router with the latest features in today's market.  Quad core cpu in this Asus doesn't bog or slow down even with multiple wifi devices.  Performs better than my last $200 Netgear and lets not talk about Netgear horrible firmware upgrades and terrible phone app.  This Asus is better in every category!
1,couldn't get it to work  Can ping websites on WAN and connect to devices via wireless LAN but couldn't get the devices access to the internet through the router.  ASUS website wasn't much help.
5,Once installed it's pain free!
1,Worked for one month then stopped working at all (No Wi-Fi impossible to connect through cable). Made firmware restore did not help apparently the problem is in the hardware. At the moment I work in a country without ASUS service center so this device turned into a brick on the shelf. I don’t recommend to buy.
5,this router is super fast
2,I use the time restriction for my children devices. It doesn’t work as smoothly as I thought it would.
5,Has worked great for me
1,Erratic wifi speeds and periodic freezing since I got it less than 4 months ago. Ended up replacing it with a different brand.
5,Very fast easy setup great coverage. No problems.
2,This router was working well for me up until these last few weeks when i moved to my new home... router keeps on disconnecting like once a day... no good..
5,So fast and easy to connect!
1,Runs freakishly hot! REALLY NOT GOOD...When I got it gettin it up and running was hellstorm of frozen firmware update nightmares.. I would have returned it had I had the time.
5,Easy setup. Good wifi coverage.
5,Great device
5,Works great
5,perfect super-fast
1,The device came with the wrong power supply. I returned it. I purchased another brand and it works fine but at a higher price. I had to purchase locally to meet  deadline. Check the package contents as soon as you open the package.
5,Working great!
5,very good
5,much better coverage
1,Unit quit 3 weeks after I got it.  Tech said port was out.  Worked to set up first day and after that was unable to add other devices.  Would not buy.
5,Works as marketed!
5,Easy setup advanced features.
5,works awesome easy set-up
5,Happy
5,so far so good.
5,One of the best routers!!! great range...
1,Came with old software and WOULD NOT UPDATE... BEATA VERSION IS AVAILABLE! after i bought a mother board from ASUS that had BETA SOFTWAER that was never updated in 3 years. I could not return it fast enough! Wi-Fi Weak at best.
5,works great!
5,does the job
1,Like many others this worked fine at first (I have the B1 version) but now it fully hangs every couple of days. Does not even ping on the wired ports requires a power cycle.
1,I’ve had three of these at my house to setup a mesh network. It always fails the same way. I’ve spent hours on phone support and they say they’re calling engineering but no help.
5,Been amazing!
5,Reliable router.
1,signal drop
1,Absolutely terrible customer service. And it doesn't even connect to my computer at all and not even my phone.
5,Great router!!
5,Great router!!
1,dropped from 60/mbs to 4/mbs in a single day. If u want to gamble then buy this router.
1,Won’t turn on after 1 day of use and I can’t even get tech support so yea it’s trash.
2,Is the new revision. Have to return it.
5,Thank you!
1,Died after a month. Ive been using this series from Asus for years. They die very often. I would change routers if I could.
1,Ordered one off these and was not B1not compatible with wifi mesh...whts  up Amazon?
1,Piece of crap quit working 40 days after purchase and can’t return now. DO NOT BUY. Absolutely crap.
1,This hasn't worked well since I bought it. Last night went to unplug again to reset it and it was hot not just warm but hot. The table it was on was also hot. Dangerous! I unplugged it and removed it immediately
1,Bought 2 1 is still working the other lasted 2 weeks before it lost the ethernet connection returned it for a refund
5,Great Router
1,Se apagó y jamas volvió a prender.
5,Perfect
1,Don't waste your time or money with this router. Has a great habit of just randomly not working. It tends to alternate between not forwarding traffic and the 5g wifi signal randomly cutting out.
1,defective product.  that is fine but asus product support line is very irresponsible.  impossible to get to an agent who can help.  i was transferred 4 times before i ran out of patients
2,Sent it back. Didn't work the way I wanted it to and finally gave up.
1,Took 4 hours to get it working not 30 minutes.The factory reset button doesn't completely clear everything back to factory reset.
1,I have to reboot this everyday!!!
1,Can not get it set up.
1,Bought one of these for my business. Ping times were horrible 200+ and the router would lose connection for roughly 1-2 seconds multiple times throughout the day typically 5-6 times an hour.
5,love it
1,I have had this router for 2 months.  Keeps dropping signal and I have to disconnect and reconnect about 10 times every day.
1,Replaced it with a Netgear router that was $30 cheaper and worked perfectly 5 minutes out of the box.  I don't know what ASUS was rated so highly.
1,Did not work. Tech support was useless
1,Confusing to get set up when it is supposed to be easy and I am someone who is pretty trch savy. Ended up returning it
1,Very difficult to connect any storage devicevia usb ports. None of my usb sticks or WD storage drives work.
1,Using wifi causes all kinds of slow downs across the entire network wired or wireless. Using the 2.4ghz crashes network completly.
1,Did not like bought Linksys. Art ac 1900
1,Using the router connected storage kicks it offline and you must power cycle to restart router.  Had difficulty generating a strong enough signal for a 1200 sq. ft. brick home.
1,Not what it’s cracked up to be I live in a 2500sq ft home and it doesn’t cover the house too many dead spots
1,died after 1 week of use.  Couldn't connect to the webpage lost all internet connections.  Returned and purchased Netgear Nighthwak R7000.
1,Will not remember my router login and password and Asus techline is the worst
1,After a few months getting intermittent signal loss with 2G and 5G Wi-Fi Can't return this anymore sadly
1,On line support was great but too many issues with logging in on multiple devices.
1,Easily overheats. We've gotten three types of routers with Asus and they've all fallen short of expectations. We returned all the routers.
1,Product was not compatible with my sysytem.Amazon still hasn't picked up my return package for credit.
1,Sent it back.
1,This router was great until it died 1 year and 2 months after I purchased it. boo
1,Always the problem is how it will last due to heat issue. Previous one only lasted less than 1 year
1,cant hook it up to my system
1,Not what I wanted.
2,ASUS says you can hook USB drives and you can. What they do not tell you is it "works sometimes" and can be a bear to get working. Been in IT related field (retired) for over 30 years and this router can be a struggle.Then you have to deal with the crappy CPU in the router. Then the tiny memory. ASUS makes this router sound like a powerhouse when it is actually a very low end $15-20 router.See associated photos I have added: The "System Status" photo is what the stats look like while attempting to transfer some files to router USB 3 port / attached drive. The parent drive is in computer and connected to router via 1Gbps LAN cable.The other photo shows that the router runs out of memory very easily.Forget this router if you have dreams of hooking a USB drive up and backing up or using files over your network. It is not worth the time and it just does not work well.It heats up and I mean gets HOT! Never had a router get this hot and I am a retired IT person.If you are looking for a router that can handle a few computers tablet of two and few phones this might be for you.I cannot recommend it to anyone for any purpose based on 12 days of real-life use. Find another router...
4,The only reason this is not 5 star is due to Asus limited documentation on connecting multiple routers.  I my case I connected three routers one as the "router" one as media bridge and one as range extender. Took about 2 weeks for me to figure out what needed to be done to get these to work as Asus said they could.  I contacted the Asus customer service and after 4-5 hours with them I was no closer to getting the Media bridge to work at 5ghz.  Turns out you have to have the same model routers (ex RT-AC66U).  for the range expander mode you can mix router models as I did.  I got the 5Gz Media bridge to work but you have to setup both routers to make this happen.  you have to select control band and make both routers work on that band.  on the Bridge you have the added step of setting up the AP point from a drop down box (select the router you want to connect to).  you have to do these steps before setting second router up as Media Bridge.  Once you have these setup you can then set up the second router to function as the media bridge.  note this setting stops the second router from picking up any WiFi signal other then the router.  As for the range extender you do need to setup the access point in the third router before you change it to range extender.  similar to what I describe for Media access.Note: all routers must be using the same/latest firmware version.  They don't play well together otherwise and you may have problems.Hope this helps
4,Was running an old Belkin54 router from 2004...it was time to upgrade. I wasn't getting anything close to the 100Mbps (around 15Mbps) promised. I purchased this one quickly set it up and now I get 115Mbps hardwired and 56Mbps wireless...it's all good! I really liked the user interface & software easy to understand & use. I don't think you can beat this one for the price.I run 5 computers. 2 iPads and 3 ROKU's with no problems accessing the internet or streaming video or music.
3,This is a good router. Let's get that out of the way.There is zero support from ASUS. The best you can hope for is sorting through the general WiFi router FAQs.I have two specific technical problems with the firmware/configuration screens.First there is a problem with setting DNS. The configuration screens allow you to set the primary DNS. That's good. The secondary DNS is hard coded into the router; it's through www.asus.com and that is a problem. I am running an appliance on my network that handles ad blocking and tracking blocking. All DNS on my network must go through that device. Having my router meddle with that decision makes me angry. Besides the ASUS DNS server is slow.The second problem is with the USB3 port on the router. I plugged a USB3 external drive into the socket and was told that I needed to install Samba version 1 (SMBv1) in Windows. This is the software that shares files over a network. Easy enough. The problem is that SMBv1 is bad. It has been 'deprecated' which means that everybody has been told to stop using it because it is insecure and hackable. That happened a long time ago. I tried to contact ASUS about this problem and was completely unable to reach anybody.
5,I've owned this router for a bit over 1.5 years and it's still going strong. I find the ASUS router browser interface to be one of the easiest to use. Firmware updates are simple and straightforward through the browser.I pay a bit more for high speed internet but get a solid 115 mbps download speed and acceptable 13mbps upload speed through the wired connection on the router. There is a minimal drop off to 102 mbps download and 12 mbps on the wireless connection but that's still more than acceptable and to be expected given obstacles like walls.While ASUS has released a "new version" of this router I still recommend RT-AC66U as a good buy at the right price.
2,This is the most time I have ever spent evaluating a router. You can skip the details if you like and jump to the summary evaluation at the end or read the long version below of how the RT-AC66U B1 would be incorporated into my network.For half of last night and 4 hours the next day I delved into almost all of the functions of this RT-AC66U B1.  This router is loaded with QoS options.  You can set the router in Media Streaming mode Web Surfing mode Gaming mode and a Custom mode.  You can set up a dual 2.4Ghz and 5GHz as a private network and then set up 6 guest networks 3-2.4Ghz and 3-5Ghz if you want.  The GUI is loaded with options.  For my purpose I set up this RT-AC66U B1 multi option high power router  as my main router replacing an Asus RT N66U Dark Knight.  My plan was to use the older Dark Knight as an AP on one side of my property.I am trying to improve the wifi reception of the shorter range but faster 5Ghz band over almost an acre.  Before setting up the RT-AC66U B1 as a primary replacing the Dark Knight I was using an Asus RT N66U Dark Knight as the primary router and an Asus RT-ACRH13 as an access point.  I have the primary router on the first floor on top of a book shelf.  The primary router is essentially in a central location in the middle of my .9 acre property.  It is connected via LAN to a Cisco SG200-26 port managed gigabit switch that is amazing just plug in the Cat5e cables and it works.  The switch is the best part of my network.  All the TVs printers computers PS4s WD TV Live streamers Tivo boxes and the RT-ACRH13 access point are connected to the Cisco switch as well as a few 5 and 8 port Netgear managed gigabit switches.  The RT-ACRH13 is hidden on top of an entertainment center on the same floor about 50 to 60 feet away from the Dark Knight.  There are 4 walls in between the RT-ACRH13 access point and the Dark Knight.  Before the access point on the other side of those 4 walls the wifi devices would have to be on the 2.4Ghz band and would have download speeds of 8 to 20.  The Dark Knight router would still deliver usable streaming and internet but not very well on the 5Ghz band.I pay for Fios 75Mbs down and 75Mbs up.  Fios has always over delivered on their internet speed.  When I had 50/50 using Ookla at [...] for evaluation I was getting wifi speeds of near 60/60 standing near the primary Dark Knight.  Paying for 75/75 I get wifi speeds of 85 to 89 equally up and down at the primary router.  With the RT-ACRH13 as an access point in the living on the same SSID for private 2.4/5Ghz and guest 2.5/5Ghz bands room I was also now getting 85/85 on the wifi devices.  Wireless devices passed seamlessly from one router to the other.  I need one more access point to cover the other side of my property.  I got the RT-AC66U B1 on sale for $70.00 after $20 dollar rebate and there was my third router to spread my wireless network.  I was going to use it as an access point but decided to replace the older Dark Knight.  That turned out to be a big waste of time.Now to make a now long story short.  The RT-AC66U B1 is going back.  After updating the firmware I went through every function changing QoS options wireless modes control channels channel bandwidths on both 2.4 and 5Ghz bands.  I took 4 pages of notes while testing download speeds.  I tested every option trying to find performance.  However as it turns out no matter what the setting the download speed on my Ipad from the RT-AC66U B1 is about 16-20Mbs but the upload speed would be 92Mbs.  I don't get it no matter what setting I changed the router would not deliver more than 16-20Mbs download speed at 6 feet from the router.  With the dual core processor this router should have been fast and able to handle many clients but it had very slow download speeds with only 26 clients.  The Dark Knight had 91 clients in its list and would still deliver 85Mbs.  I called Verizon to reset the ONT and release the IP so I could put the older Asus RT N66U Dark Knight back as my primary router.  As soon as the internet was up again I tested the wifi download speed and the Ookla speed test meter was pegged out again.  The Dark Knight delivered 85.95Mbs down and 78.12Mbs up.  Even the Asus RT-ACRH13 delivers 85Mbs download.  I don't know why I could not achieve faster download speeds out of the Asus RT-AC66U B1.  It is going back and I am buying another Asus RT N66U Dark Knight for an access point.
5,Easily fulfills all our needs. We are not ‘power users’ and don’t do any gaming. We use it for limited streaming and web browsing. It handles simultaneous video/movie streaming to three devices just fine thus far and is more than capable of handling my IP’s full bandwidth (as they all do these days). There are probably much better units out there overall but I have absolutely no complaints about this router and it fits our needs just fine.
3,I wouldn't have any complaints about this router at all--a first.  But the power switch randomly broke and doesn't stay pressed.  I've never had this happen with ANY push button power switch and it's especially disappointing because the router is powered on and off at maybe half a dozen times per year.  So the power switch survives something like 30 uses while the rest of the router soldiers on.  It's really the little details like that maybe the cheapest part besides the screws holding it together that make or break a product.  I keep the router on by wrapping a rubber around it.
1,Angel here in Texas and I'm writing this review based on my own experience with the RT-AC66U-B1 Asus router. I bought out this router to replace my old Arris Surfboard that struggles to reach my smart TV especially with 4K programs; I do not Gaming and have only two desk PC's for finances/ bill payments and occasional online card games; so far this is how the story goes: Ordered this item on Amazon in Feb-04-'21 and it arrived three days later; hooked it up to my internet and everything seemed to be working okay; tried to register the router unsuccessfully; the model of this router is not on the list of the Asus items to register and it doesn't allow to type the model number; had to go to work 12 hrs. nightshifts (4 nights) and I didn't have the chance to go back for the registration process; then the freezing came and we lost power and internet; electricity came back on Feb-18-'21 and the router kept my internet working intermittently; asked Asus customer service for help to register the router; had to deal with different customer service representatives at every email sent and received; all of them are "very willing to help on whatever I need" but the issue is still there; my last email received from them it was on Feb-19-'21; I was told that they will be in touch with me in the next 24-48 hrs. but five days had gone and nobody had tried to reach me; still waiting for the Registration Team to approve the copy of my Amazon Receipt as a valid proof of purchase. Disconnected the Asus router and hooked up my old Arris Surfboard; Internet is always there. This router seems to work okay for a couple of days and then it drops down the internet. I hope this honest review will help you in choosing the right router; it might save you several headaches like the ones I'm right now having.
5,Great router for being 3 years old hardware. Delivers 1000mb wired connection wifi maxes out at 950mb going through 2 brick walls. I have 3 phones 1 printer 2 consoles 2 smartTV 1 PC 3 laptops wireless cameras and 2 storage devices. No drops or delays while gaming GTAV Battlefront 2 or my kids minecraft server.
5,router works great but power button failed 1st fix--in a hurry I put a woodworking clamp on it  (to hold button in the on position) after a few months wanting to use the clamp again I cut a slice of cork from a wine bottle and super glued it down over the button (in the on position) put some tape to hold it in place while it dried--
5,In a word flawless.Admittedly Asus gets some free review love since my experience with Belkin (AC1200) was so AWFUL.  I had decided to cheap out on a new AC router to upgrade an N+ Linksys.  That ended up costing me two days of pulling my hair out as the pedestrian Belkin router proved to me that it was basically an overpriced overhyped 2.4G router since it could not hold a 5G connection if its life depended on it.  Add to that constant "your modem is broke - you need to power cycle for the 5th time in an hour" message and that was that.Enter this Asus goodness.  Plugged in set up no worries.  Never a dropped 5G connection.  Never stupid power cycle requests.  And everything is very zippy from router settings changes to connections.  Belkin you need to go back to making Apple stupidstuffs.
3,Purchased this unit to replace an older router that is now out of support.  Could not configure the new router.  Logging in returned a 404 not found error.  Called tech support.  Helpful but married to a troubleshooting script that just wasted a lot of time.  Ultimately had me configure the router wirelessly using a tablet.  That worked but could not connect to my pc via ethernet only wireless.  Support blamed my pc but fact is pc works fine with old router and ethernet connection and I cannot see being forced to configure router via tablet.  Returned and looking for a better solution.
5,My family and I were in the dark ages with our previous router. We were only getting 15% of our bandwidth. Netflix was always pixelated and even Youtube was a chore if someone else was on the net doing anything. This router and it's super easy setup has saved us. We get all our bandwidth and 0 problems with streaming anything. At any given time we have an ipad 3 laptops and a tablet or two streaming content. This works for a decent price compared to other routers.
5,It was easy to install and performs flawlessly. Although I rated ASUS' tech support as a five I've not needed to use it so this is just my guess.
5,Added this to my 68U ac1900 to add additional coverage to my house and it works awesome!  so happy with it.  good job asus with the aimesh.  NOTE you need the b1 version.  I bought mine used for about half of new works perfect.
5,Relatively easy setup includes necessary cables works as advertised.
5,Took a little while to set it up but works very good I can go outside and listen to my radio on Bluetooth now good range.
5,I read the previous reviws on this product it seemed to be mixed so I decided to buy it anyway and use it as an access point it works great providing the extra WiFi coverage I needed.
5,A great router with strong signal and great coverage much better than the Netgear R6300v2 and the Tp-Link 1043NDv3 even with 8dbi antennas both at 2.4 and 5G.UI a bit sluggish though but not as important after set up.
1,All the bragging about ASUS being best not so much. I had same is like lot of other customers/ reviews where everything was fine until firmware upgrade and that’s where headaches begin. Crazy thing is even though app gives you option to upgrade firmware according to their tech support (which is useless) you can only do it manually with computer well ASUS I’m not buying computer just to upgrade your garbage product!!! Even though it said firmware upgrade unsuccessful it messed up all of my connections so I had to reset it meaning set up all my WiFi devices all over. Extremely frustrating considering it’s 2020 firmware upgrade shouldn’t be stuck in 1992 process. I end up orderingLinksys router and hope to have better luck. Read lot of reviews and seems like just about every “top brand” company seems to have issues with firmware upgrades I don’t get it. It’s such important step and these companies wouldn’t take appropriate measures to resolve it.I hope Linksys doesn’t disappoint I really don’t want to go back paying my internet company to rent router.
5,Watch Full HD and higher quality videos on Youtube without lag. Easy setup and many features.
5,Does what i need it to
1,awful All promised featured of this router do not work at allthe NAS does not work the AI cloud does not work and support is  terrible for this devicenobody knows how to use it  7 hours on the phone with tech support and  got nowherei can't get any  features for  storage sharing to work at allthe ai cloud app is garbage i can see my PC but i cant get into any folder it just hangs there indefinitely every single time.The range is really bad on this router too  my kitchen is 2 small rooms away  and  have an open floor plan  and my smart home devices  only sometimes respond does not do even half of what it promises to do if you  buy this for ai cloud or NAS forget about ever getting it to work the UI is the worst for this router too unless you have severe autism like it's developers then you have no chance of ever figuring it out .Corrupts any HDD you plug into it and drives are visible  but not accessable .
1,I write this short comment about this router in order to warn potential buyers. Ive gone though 3 units of this very router. Each of them has been working for aproximitly 1-2 years before breaking for unknown reason. Ive noticed that each time the router has broken it has been so warm in the backside that i almost burn my hands on it. The router has always been standing on top of a desk in a well ventilated manner. Further more the feel of the product gives a cheep impression. Kinda that cheep china plastic kinda touch. I highly highly recommend that you do your research into the quality of this product before making a purchase./frustrated customer
2,Internet drops sometimes. My router complete drops and disconnected from the wifi every few days. Not sure if I got defective unit
5,Good
1,I thought this would be a great way to solve teenager home network load issues with 2 nodes and 'Mesh' to improve coverage in the house. Nothing but lost connections stuttering streaming and slow speeds and 3 factory resets to finally get it to work. I was testing internet transfer speeds and noticed my download speed went from nearly 200MB often on former single router (netgear) to 35MB with a two node Mesh purchased as a set.I unplugged the second node i kept upstairs in my office download speed jumped to 200MB again immediately. So much for that idea and attempt. Expensive paperweight for second node. hopefully my streaming will stop stuttering out now as well.
1,I ordered the product in February.  I've had to re-load the configuration at least once a month.  So far this month (August) I've had to reload five times in three weeks.  I can see my network and share files between computers on the network but it constantly loses the internet connection.  It's being used as a wifi-extender and the modem to which it is wirelessly connected retains it's internet connection.  As soon as I reload the config. from disk it's back to normal but the need to constantly reconfigure is not worth it.  It is located in my home office which is air conditioned.  There are no power problems (my desktop PC remains running).  It is simply a sorry product.
1,With one ASUS router already working just fine I decided to go a with a cheaper model. It powered on fine produced a wifi signal and connected via LAN too. I could not get any internet access with it after plugging it into the switch then directly to the ISP feed into my home. Nope nothing.The ASUS website doesn't even have this model listed for support so beware.Return initiated with Amazon.
1,I bought the router and it has the primary functions of transmitting signal.  However when I wanted to expand a little bit more by connecting a hard drive to it I was not able to do it.  After trying for some hours I finally called ASUS support and they were no good either after making me download some stuff the representative was not able to help me.  Then he just hang up on me... Very bad customer service if I wanted a router with just the basic functions I would've bought something cheaper...
2,I tried to like it but after few days wireless both 5G and 2G started disconnectings even I moved it almost to central of the house and high and make sure it have air space around for cooling. I liked it User management interface it is very easy to connect to internet but wireless is much worse than my old ATT gateway router. I am trying different brand now.
1,We purchased this router and had flawless operation until one day it decided that it would no longer allow internet to work on both wifi bands 5ghz 2.4ghz along with the LAN ports. We can access the router setup but for some reason we have been unable to connect to the internet (which has been confirmed fine by the ISP along with a visit with a comcast tech. We confirmed that our modem works fine and even swapped it out for a brand new one to no avail. The issue lies with the ASUS router. I would not buy this product unless you intend on replacing it far before you would expect to.
3,I've had my Linksys EA6900 and EA7300 for several years. I'm currently using the EA6900 due to some issues w/ the latest EA7300 firmware. I have 10-13 devices both wired and wireless on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks at any given time with no problems.Linksys is not good about updates which is an issue for getting security fixes. So I decided to buy the Asus RT-AC66U_B1 as it has good reviews. Looking at the Asus site showed current firmware updates and I updated to the latest release. I also thought that the AiProtection from TrendNet might be useful.I tried two of these units one a refurb and the other brand new. The price was right and both units worked out of the box. There are a lot more features in the Asus firmware although I have no use for most of them. I found the UI to be good and fairly responsive.However whereas both Linksys routers are able to reach all parts of my 1550 sq. ft. condo with a decent 5 GHz signal the Asuses would constantly drop the connection in the farthest room. That turned out to be a deal breaker for me and I returned both units. In spite of the lack of Linksys firmware updates I'll stay with the router that provides the best coverage.
3,Bought this B1 version to "upgrade" a non-B1 (which frankly was working fine but it went to a good home).  Kept getting random internet drops during periods of moderate internet use (single person in the home Zoom call and an Exchange connection to a single PC).  No response on router interface.  Device felt warm.  Had to unplug it and let it cool down at least once a week.  Ended up buying a USB-powered fan and plugged that into the router's USB port.  Zero issues since then.  A little disappointing to see thermal issues on this version - certainly not an issue with prior versions in the same environment/use case.
5,Updated to a 5 as I mentioned my issue previous was user error.This is a good router for the price.Easy to setup and administer.Full line speed from Spectrum cable modem (400MB) to LAN ports.I think I'd raise this to a 5 if I can get hidden SSID and MAC FIltering to work on Wifi.I know that is old school for added security.Searching for a community page for support and questions similar to what TP-Link hosts but have not found one.Very pleased with the router so far.
5,I was leery after reading the negative views and ready to return the router at a moments notice but the install and performance were outstanding. I didn't give any points to tech support because I didn't need any support.  I was having all sorts of issues with a wireless printer before and now no more issues. Hooray for this router!
1,I added this to my AI Mesh network and it constantly goes down.  The other two devices are blue caves and they work good.  I added this one to increase my coverage but it just totally sucks.  The signal is strong and fast but it randomly fails a lot.  I've been a tech for over 20 years professionally.  The consumer grade electronics have never been great but this isn't even good.  The Blue Caves aren't bad.  This one is bad.
5,I replaced an older router with this and the difference is night an day. The multiple antennas seem to help giving it a longer range specially thru walls. The setup is fairly easy but if you are tech savvy you can access advanced options if desired.  I stream and upload large files and this router is able to handle both and also my other wife devices at home quite well.
5,Don't know about the the performance of this unit except that it has great wireless performance and syncs with ai mesh routers flawlessly.
5,My new internet supplier gonetspeed recommended this router. I have no dead spots was easy to set up for a low tech guy. And it works.
5,Worked as described delivered on time.
5,Perfect router to match with my other AC1750. Was able to extend my wifi range throughout the whole house thanks to AImesh. Wonderful router.
5,It does what it is supposed to do if Asus routers are as good as their motherboards I do not see any problems on the years to come. Will update review if the routers decides to act out so far so good.
5,It works well and looks well made. No issues so far happy with my purchase.
5,Set up in a small office environment and it does a great job.
5,Great signal. Took a while to get Set up.
5,Do your homework on these.
5,Very easy to setup. User interface is easy to understand and has tons of options. Great signal on both bands. You wont be disappointed.
5,Great router but doesn't support AIMESH. Same router as RT-AX55 but with different firmware. Returned forRT-AX55
5,Works great for us all our devices get awesome signal and we have a lot of devices connected to the router and it handles it perfectly. Love this router.
5,Easy to set up
5,Have two in AI mesh and they work well. I have 5 ring cameras and 5 smart TV's 10 smart lights pool pump etc and they are all covered. I love it.
5,Easy to install and has worked well ever since
5,Man did this new router make a difference.  Leave it to Amazon we can anything we need on their website.  Never disappointed
5,The router optimum issued me when i signed up with them had horrible signal as soon as i left the room the signal dropped dramatically and would constantly dosconnect. I bought this router and it changed everything for the better!! Much better signal even when outside the houwe and i have faster speed as well. Very easy to install took like 2 minutes
5,These work great have an older one  that stop working. I would recommend to all customers to buy these. now i have to hook it up.
5,Used the stock latest ASUS firmware. Wired based/wireless handset VOIP phone would loose connection until VOIP TSL2 said to turn off the SIP ALG in the router. Apparently it's poorly implemented on many routers. Fixed the issue.Asus needs to allow setting the TTL in the router.
5,Came with instructions so it was very easy to set up and use
4,I received the router and could not install. I thought that I did something wrong and called tech.They told me that the router was defective. I returned it and exchanged for the same one. Installed and it worked well. One issue still is that my printer worked well immediately but the scanner did not. It's aAll in one unit.
5,I specifically bought this router because it has OpenVPN and because it was recommended by NordVPN.  The VPN setup was easy.  It works great right out of the box.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  Highly recommended!
5,Our old wireless router was over ten years old....and it was terribly slow.  We wanted to have wireless access throughout our home that was dependable and functional and this was a great upgrade!  We did speedtests before and after and it blew that old router out of the water (as it should!).
5,Use it every day the router login page had a different password but a reset on the router fixed that problem.
5,I just got this to replace a cheap Netgear WNR-2020 that ironically is considerably more expensive.  This ASUS demolishes the Netgear my Xbox Series X is on the Ethernet cable and my download speeds went from 80Mbps to over 220Mbps.  Wow.  It also has a dual band radio so there is two separate networks n my home.  The app is running flawlessly on my iPad 6th gen and I have control over every aspect.  I wish I did this years ago.  I have had it for about a week and a half and nobody has even been kicked off the network.  We used to get kicked all the time and had to reset the Netgear every few days.  This was a phenomenal purchase.  I was truly shocked at just how much performance I gained.  Get it you won’t be disappointed.
5,Compre este equipo por dos motivos:1. Mi esposa mi hija y yo estamos todo el dia en videoconferencias. El anterior router se congelaba mucho o perdia paquetes. Este router mejoro mucho la calidad en la transmisión de los datos.2. Mejorar la potencia de la señal. Estoy a menos de 10m de la ubicación del router. Con algunas paredes. Pero no logre mejorar la intensidad de la señal. Aunque ahora es mas estable y no pierde conexión. Pense que mejoraria la potencia al tener la funcionalidad de Beamforming pero no fue asi.En la parte de configuración es muy sencillo o muy detallado depende de tu nivel de conocimientos.En general es un buen producto.
5,Sin ser un experto siguiendo las guias puedes configurar muy fácilmente. En 1 minuto ya esta funcional. En 5 minutos tienes los ajustes mínimos. La app te simplifica mucho las cosas para montar un disco duro externo control parental o montar una impresora. El alcance inalambrico es excelente cubre bien tanto en un piso arriba como uno abajo o 3 paredes de ladrillo.Siendo un poco entusiasta aplicando conocimientos un poco avanzado en redes en un par de horas tienes una red dual WAN QOS VPN y mucha personalización sin recurrir a firmware externo. Si es necesario se puede optar por el firmware de ASUSWRT Merlin.
5,Un poco difícil de configurar en el módem puesto que cada módem tiene sus configuraciones particulares y yo lo use en modo bridge. Tardé media hora en esa configuración que fue más problema del módem que del router. De ahí en adelante todo fue de lo más fácil y la app de asus para el teléfono es super practica para monitoreo configurar etc. Desde ahí hago reglas para que mis hijos no tengan Internet ciertas horas y configuro redes para visitantes. La verdad estoy sumamente contento con mi compra.  Además que el alcance es muy muy bueno y estable.
5,Llevo ocho meses con el router y funciona muy bien no hay desconexiones raramente he tenido que reiniciarlo. El software del router trae muchas opciones de configuración. Con su puerto USB 3.0 puedes conectar un disco duro externo para compartir archivo dentro de tu red por medio de su servidor samba o de su servidor FTP. Con el otro puerto USB 2.0 puedes conectar una impresora incluso a dicho puerto puedes conectar un módem 3G/4G o un celular para compartir tu Internet móvil. Lo único que no me dejó del todo satisfecho fue el alcance aun cuando alcanza a cubrir mi casa que es pequeña. El área que cubre es buena pero no excelente para un router de este precio y características.En definitiva si buscas un buen router lo recomiendo ampliamente.
5,Al inicio puedes llegar a pensar que el precio es excesivo o que no vale la pena comprar un router así para tu hogar sin embargo Asus te hace la vida más fácil con una rápida instalación y seguimiento que no requiere de conocimientos avanzados en informática solo basta con descargar la aplicación leer y seguir los pasos. Es de lo más amigable y accesible que puedes encontrar además de que la potencia de la señal es increíble una de las primeras mejoras que requieres si quieres mantener conectado tu hogar y tu familia.
3,Es el mejor router para una casa que hay aunque tienen demasiados Bugs todos estos router y casi no hay actualizaciónes configurarlo respecto al manejo de los USB para que quede como uno quiere los servidores es estarlo borrando configurando hasta que en una de esas agarra el DDNS es malisimo.
5,Este producto cuenta con una potencia inalámbrica muy buena mayor a los dispositivos que nos entregan nuestras operadoras estoy completamente satisfecho con este producto y lo recomiendo al 100% su precio está algo elevado pero es un precio que lo vale el sistema Asus-Wrt funciona muy bien y tiene muchas funciones que permiten configurar tu red a fondo además existe un programador que usa el mismo Asus-wrt pero lo modifica para mejorarlo o cambiar su rendimiento llamado asus-wrt Merlin que es fácil de instalar  ya llevo tiempo con el router y no he tenido problemas.==== Actualización====El router se calienta mucho y últimamente que he usado mas el Internet por el aislamiento he notado que de vez en cuando la red se cae por completo obligándome a conectarme a la ONT del operador (Axtel) desconozco las razones que causan este problema algunas veces se soluciona reiniciando restaurando o desconectando un dispositivo...==== Actualización 2 ====Compré otro router este mismo modelo y lo conecte por AiMesh y mis problemas se solucionaron el problema lo causaba las grandes cantidades de dispositivos wifi ahora entre los dos se reparten la carga y la cobertura que ahora tengo es excelente! Aunque por el tamaño de mi casa aún me falta un poco...
5,Me recomendaron comprar este router pero lo pensaba por el precio ya que existen opciones mas baratas pero la verdad fue muy buena compra nuestra wifi mejoro mucho ya que antes en partes de la casa no llegaba bien la señal o los dispositivos aparecían conectados pero sin navegación.La app para el celular esta muy practica ya que te deja controlar el router y ver que dispositivos están conectados y si se conectan alguna consola tiene una opción para mejorar la conexión  creando perfiles para juegos. Muy recomendable compra.
5,Bought this from AMAZON SG.  Ordered on 27 Apr with ETA on May 02.  The delivery arrives early on Apr 29 exceeding my expectation on delivery considering that this is an overseas shipment..  The set up was smooth with strong signal to link up to my main router which is blocked by a wall.  With this AP my 2 other bedrooms are receiving strong signals.  For buyers who are in Singapore please note that the product comes with a US plug so you would need an adaptor.
5,Solucionó todos los problemas de conectividad ya puedo disfrutar del internet con buena velocidad (5G) en toda la casa (3 pisos) y mi celular capta la señal de 2.4Ghz incluso a 1/2 cuadra.Adicionalmente pude conectar inlambricamente todos mis dispositivos (antes requería de una conexión por cable para las consolas o para los servisios de streaming)
1,Me asesoré previamente y me dijeron que con este Router perfectamente alcanzaría a cubrir con red toda mi casa. Sin embargo no llega a ninguna habitación realmente apenas y es unos metros más amplio el alcance que tiene a comparación del módem de Telmex. Yo lo que quería era un módem eficiente pero ahora tendré que comprar un repetidor que era lo que no quería.
5,Really good router. It's able to keep my entire smart home online and stable. Works so well I've removed my WiFi repeater as I no longer need it. Great value for the price.
5,El Router resulto ser mucho mas de lo que esperaba tiene un buen precio y esta bastante recomendable si quieres ahorrar unos billetes.... y sobre todo buen producto con chip de alta gama..
2,This router is dropping my connection at random about 15-20 times a week and I know that my modem is stable as I went to my ISP tech support as well. I reported the issue to Asus but have had no response at all. I'm going to replace it as soon as I can.
5,Buen router excelente señal configuración sencilla el Qos intuitivo y ágil 3 maneras de modificarlo con este router si explotas el ancho de banda de tu proveedor de internet la app sencilla y sólo para configurar ciertos parámetros. Detalle únicamente cuando se conecta un disco duro sube el procesamiento y RAM del router no se trabó pero si fue algo extraño que subiera tanto el proceso sólo con el Disco Duro.
5,I have no complaints. This router works great is smaller in size and the software is more robust than my previous router.
5,Un producto excelente. Sin duda volvería a comprar un router Asus. El alcance que tiene la red es excelente para un depto. de 110 metros y la señal llega todavía más lejos. Las opciones de configuración es otro punto muy a favor del router pero lo verdaderamente atractivo es sin duda su precio; vale cada centavo. Tuve oportunidad de probar un AC1900 que costó el doble y este no le pide absolutamente nada. Lo recomiendo al 100%.
4,Good signal to all areas of the house (1200 sq. feet) and basementt. Occasional dropped internet and choppy live video but I do not know if this is the fault of the router. Streaming is strong and constant on streaming apps such as Prime and Netflix. Big improvement on my 4 year old Linksys router.
5,Este router de Asus es el mejor que he tenido. Ofrece un excelente desempeño y posibilidad de escalabilidad con su tecnología AiMesh superior a la tecnología Mesh de otras marcas. Nunca me ha fallado y tiene un alcance muy bueno.
5,A pesar de que fue de importación llegó muy rápido. Funciona muy bien fue fácil de configurar y la señal llega a todo mi departamento.Altamente recomendable esta marca para routers en casa y la oficina contamos con ellos y funcionan sin dar problemas.
5,Easy to configure but you do need some knowledge to setup more complex tasks. Port forwarding is a breeze!
1,My router just fried. Was great up till today only bought less the 5 months ago. Have to idea how to call amazon to get a replacement as asus told me t bring it back to where I bought it for a new one. Paid big money not happy here
3,works perfectly for wireless routing but chokes a little bit on wired connections if you're interacting with API's with a bunch of parallel requests. i had to order a wifi router because the wired connection was too slow for my work station.
5,Excelente artículo mejoro mucho la señal y velocidad en casa. Ya llega a cada rincón.
5,La calidad-precio del producto es abismal con este mi conexión por wifi logró estabilidad y también un mayor alcance es de lo mejor que hay en el mercado sin gastar demasiado.
5,Muy bueno. Me sorprendio mas de lo esperado
5,Excelente mucho mejor de lo que yo esperaba estoy muy contento y sastifecho La entrega excelente muy bien...Gracias y Saludos...
4,El App para control parental no se puede usar fuera de WiFi. No se puede usar desde red de datos en cualquier lugar. Pero funciona muy bien.
5,Es más de lo que esperaba por fin he conseguido tener una velocidad de descarga estable además de que la ha aumentado y puedo administrar fácil y rápido las redes la app sirve de maravilla para monitorear cualquier actividad.
4,Received on the 14th day after order. Good to use and easy set up. Faster and stronger signalling compare to my previous router( ASUS AC1200). Type of plug in adopt is Chinese type.I have to use change-over plug
1,Si este producto es para consumidor entonces tienes que ser un técnico experto en redes. Esto es cero amigable !!
5,Si tu presupuesto no es muy amplio este router es de lo mejor qué hay. Funciona de 10 en películas juegos PCoIP y todo lo que he probado no se calienta no hay que estarlo reiniciando. Y además tiene buen alcance de la señal
5,Llega la señal a todda la casa sin problemas  tambien facil de configurar  hay videos en lineas que  te muestran
4,Excelente producto  facil de configurar y trabaja mucho mejor que cualquier modem que te entregan con el servicio de internet muy recomendable
5,Desde que lo cambie no he tenido ningun problema ademas que es muy rapida la instalacion y configuracion.. aparte tengo mas señal donde antes no alcanzaba.
5,Es una excelente opcion para conectar varios equipos a la vez es muy fácil de configura
5,Trabaja muy bien aunque la cobertura no es mucha pensé que trabajaba muy similar a lo que llaman rompe muros
5,Buen velocidad muchas características de configuración en particular el VPN Client.
5,Es un producto que en calidad precio es de los mejores además cuenta con grandes herramientas para monitorear la red.
5,Excelente compra fácil de instalar potente y muy buen rango de cobertura muy recomendable
4,Bien pero no alcanza la distancia que dice.
5,Muy buen producto
5,Cumple ampliamente buena relacion calidad precio sugiero ponerle firmware asus merlin
5,Si pudiera le ponía 6 estrellas de lo mejor que he comprado.
5,sin duda una de las interfaces más faciles de usar
5,Me gustó que es muy fácil de instalar

5,Independientemente de las opciones ya tradicionales en los router de Asus el rendimiento de este modelo que sin ser un AX es excelente la potencia de señal (tengo el router en el segundo piso y distribuye la red de 5Ghz en mas del 70% de la casa en nivel de calidad decente) en el caso de la red de 2.4Ghz es bastante estable y en realidad es un AC1900 no un 1750 por lo que tiene mayor rendimiento del que menciona el fabricante (esta información se puede constatar en varios reviews en la red o en pruebas si tienen el equipo para verificarlo) su alcance es obviamente mayor que la red de 5Ghz y ofrece una excelente estabilidad de conexion las opciones de configuración en particular las de control parental y seguridad (Trend Micro) que son algo que todo padre de familia debiera de tener en consideración cuando los niños tienen acceso a la red a traves de tabletas y celulares (independientemente de los bloqueos de seguridad en estos) y su detección de paginas inseguras y bloqueo de las mismas permiten ofrecer una mayor seguridad con la navegación de aquellos miembros de la familia con un conocimiento muy básico o inexistente sobre riesgos de seguridad en la web.Es importante mencionar que además este modelo viene con soporte para configuración Aimesh lo cual lo hace compatible y da soporte para expansion a futuro aun cuando se adquiera un router con soporte WiFi 6 ya que estos tienen de fabrica el soporte para este tipo de configuración en todos sus modelos.Ya por ultimo aunque ya es algo característico de todos los modelos de Asus el soporte para crear red de invitados independiente de las redes principales y bloquear el acceso de esta a las redes internas por seguridad permite poder ofrecer a los invitados una conexion a la web sin que esto afecte a los dispositivos principales ya que automáticamente se asigna una prioridad menor a estas conexiones sobre las redes principales (además de la posible asignación de ancho de banda gracias al QoS adaptativa o también la opción de limitador de ancho de banda por dispositivo dentro de las mismas opciones) la mejor opción en este momento en precio-rendimiento-seguridad en routers de Asus y en mi caso lo agarre en oferta en menos de $1800 lo que recomendaría estar cazando los descuentos a la espera de una nueva oferta en el modelo.
5,Tengo un edificio con 5 deptos y un negocio a un costado donde se encuentra el Router. El repetidor  lo instalé con cable de red en los deptos y no he tenido ningún problema con la señal nadie se a quejado de los huespedes
5,El envío tardo varios día más de lo esperado. Pero el equipo es altamente recomendable sencillo y de gran alcance comprobado.
4,Buena inversión para la gestión de múltiples dispositivos
5,Excellent Product & Service Incredibly Fast Shipping
5,I put this router in the bedroom which is also my wife's study to be a aimesh node. Even since she never complain about the weak wifi signal again. We are all so happy now.
