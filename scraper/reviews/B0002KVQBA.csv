5,I am a self-proclaimed audiophile with a serious inclination towards VALUE. This my friends is a product that has immense value.To give you an idea of what I mean by value my previous set-up had KLH Subwoofers that were so under-rated and unknown that it wasn't until I spoke of them that people even considered them as KLH (being that KLH for some unknown reason has a bad name. Now by no means would I consider myself cheap...I like value--inexpensive items that do as they say while preserving quality. Being that Matt Polk put the name of the Polk legacy on these the quality should not be in question at any point.I think the only reason that these are at such a reduced rate is because of their meager ratings (50-Watt amp and 10" woofer...something else that is unattractive is the front facing port--don't they know that most new speakers come with the port to the rear to avoid port noise??!!) and even moreso reviewing its bigger brothers and sisters with downward firing ports means that although this sub isn't in the same class there are offerings for more discerning listeners. If I had a good $1000 to blow on subwoofers I would have probably bought two of the PSW110s without question...Ah yes...TWO.The biggest reason that I look for subwoofers of value is so that I can purchase more than one (if you were wondering why I keep using these nouns in the plural). Although I am still relatively young <30y/o I've been into home theater since the days when there was no such thing as Home-Theater-In-a-Box and Definitive Technology illuminated the minds of young aspiring audiophiles with diagrams of their BP3000s tower speakers with built in 300-Watt Amplifiers and 15" Sub-/Woofers. Ah yes...those good ol' days...Now Home Theater is the standard and it may be difficult to discern one product from another (trust me most of it is trash--INCLUDING BOSE). The best way to go about building a theater system is not by adhering to the one-click feature-like HTiB. Piece by piece...step by step... It helps to buy speakers in a particular company's model family since they are normally making use of the same drivers and are normally tonally matched. Many companies claim their speakers as tonally matched without considering the effects of the difference in enclosure size and construction of a center channel and a satellite... Ah...that's info for you--but not why I'm writing this review...This review is about the two Polk Audio 10PSWs sitting here in front of me.They sound awesome for what they are. I'm glad that an earlier reviewer made it known that the 50w amplifier is continuously rated--not instantly...or even rated considering a massive amount of Total Harmonic Distortion--as many companies do and then say "@ 1KHz"...who sits home listening to 1KHz Sine signals?? At loud volumes even? Don't be fooled. Normally they follow that spec up with "30-20KHz +/-3db" As many of you probably know...that's HALF the power that they're quoting it at...3db = 1/2 Wattage (or twice the wattage considering the context...normally it's LESS not MORE).Many of you I'm sure have bought one of these and are either loving it or hating it (most loving from what I can tell). Indeed with the varying types of music and source program I use these fit the bill nicely. The sound is present...strong...detailed. I haven't experienced the muddy sound as other people have noted. I'm sure that it's not just luck...I have two...surely one would be muddy if this was prevalent.Now time for pointers (I love the reviewers who leave pointers...it's normally the nudge for most people to consider a truly awesome product--as this one is)Pointer#1: Buy Two (2)These are probably some of the least expensive best sounding subs you can get right now. When in the market for a sub you should at least have a budget of $200--$400 even...otherwise you'll find yourself wondering what you paid for... Remember there are materials (wood cables) components (subwoofer driver subwoofer amplifier) and labor that goes into that bass machine. If any of these things aren't optimally constructed the overall device will suffer. You can understand this I'm sure. The flip side of this is that surely there was a corner cut somewhere. Thus why continue to hammer out your amplifier? The amp is often overlooked in all of this. Most people see the pretty cone of their subwoofer and totally disregard the reality that the real work horse of the build is the amplifier.Having two subs is not for more bass...but to conserve the life of the subwoofers you have. In addition when the time comes to party or watch a movie you don't have to worry about your subs (the drivers themselves) bottoming out or sounding as if they're straining. Thus with two you get the benefit of both worlds (longevity present sound quality). Electronics have limitations...use them wisely and they will perform AND last a very long time...Pointer #2: Gain >1/2You should never have to turn your amplifier gain past half. Past half is where distortion and clipping are introduced. Sure depending on your source this may not be prevalent but if you have a good strong signal there will come a time when you hear artifacts that weren't intended for reproduction (e.g. distortion clipping). As a rule if you have to turn your sub past half you might want to adjust your settings in your receiver or see Pointer #1 again... A benefit of two is that the both of them can be readjusted lower to account for the assistance or each other. My Polks are each at about 1/3 (and that's only because I really enjoy the sound right now...so I'm excited...otherwise they would each be at 1/4). The reason you only want "enough" volume is because headroom is what you want... this is the power that is used during explosions kick drums--sudden bursts...this is what you bought it for right?Yes that's right. I know that there are many other reviewers--bless their heart--who are praising having it just past half or 3/4 of the way up. Mine are at 1/3 and it was like that when I only had one connected. Now that I have both connected I'll have to half the volume of both of them to equal the volume of the one (and no the gain knob potentiometers are not linear so it'll have to be by ear).Pointer #3: Subs Fill Not DominateSubwoofer modules are only meant to fill in where the other speakers in your system fail. My set-up has Mirage towers as my mains. However the built in crossover of my Harmon/Kardon handles all bass traffic well--cut off at 60Hz (the point where bass can not be located by the human ear). Having the setting higher than this will not only put more stress on your sub but also the amplifier (lets not forget the amp). When adjusting the gain you just want to ensure that the frequencies from the sub are at around the same volume as your main speakers. This will keep you from being bass hungry. That's not the point of a sub...this isn't a mobile system...this is home. The environment doesn't warrant that level of "hyper-bass"... If done this way you will be able to reach higher sound pressure levels while retaining your dynamism...These pointers should help with any sub...this sub is truly a great great buy...Hope this helps...
4,I bought a smaller and cheaper 8" in sub for my home office. I had to send it back for a refund because like the saying goes 'you get what you pay for'. I looked for a replacement and came across this sub by Polk. I spent $90 on the cheaper sub so an extra  60ish dollars wasn't a big deal.I have it hooked up to a small 200w Sony (50 x 4) receiver that does not have an LFE out. I have this sub hooked up via the monitor out port on the receiver so all of the power is coming 100% from the sub itself.Being that I was just looking to add some low end to go with the book shelf speakers used as the mains this sub does the trick. It actually has way more bass than I need for the smaller room. But who cares right? Once I discovered this was going to do everything I wanted and more I decided to compare it to the Klipsch Reference sub hooked up to my home theater which is also 10".I hooked up the Polk to the second LFE port on my Onkyo Receiver and ran a side by side comparison. At lower volumes there isn't much difference. Turn the volume up and you start to notice that the lows from the Polk weren't as tight as the Klipsch and the crossover of the Polk had to be dialed in a little more. On the Polk explosions in action movies were deep but some caused some slap from the woofer itself. Harder hitting bass in hip hop would start to distort while the Klipsch held strong.Now comparing a much more expensive sub woofer to this Polk seems unfair but I wasn't trying to say one is better than the other more just observing what the Polk was capable of knowing the capabilities of the Klipsch. The Polk held it's own until I really pushed it which is what I expected. I was actually able to push it harder than I thought I would be able to before the two subs started showing major differences.For the price point this Polk sub is a solid sub for an entry level sub. If you are building a home theater on a budget this sub will get the job done. You may need to play with the crossover switching from music to movies but it's a minor inconvenience. For a small room sound system like I intend to use it this is more than you would ever need.
5,There are lots of positive reviews of this sub.  Mine is black not cherry.  It looks great.  (can't speak for cherry)  It has a nice grill that is held on by 6 points.  The 10" powered sub puts out a lot of bass if you want it to.  Mine is set to 1/2 volume and the crossover is in the middle and I like a lot of bass.  (have 600 watt RMS Kicker sub and amp in my car)  Even though I had a "subwoofer out" port on my stereo I hooked mine up to the speaker outs and hooked my speakers up to the sub.  It can be hooked up with RCA cables however if you choose to do it that way.  My speakers actually had an issue at very low volume where one of them wouldn't work right. (not efficient enough is my guess)  This sub seems to have solved that issue.There is a nice 3 position toggle type switch on the back for power modes.  There is On Auto and Off.  I have it set to Auto.  It powers up right away when I turn up the volume.  It says on for 15 minutes after the last time it sensed a signal.  (and powers off each time reliably)  I monitored this for a couple of days before writing this review.  Auto is perfect for my application.  I leave my receiver on all day long every day but turn the volume to zero.  It turns the sub off when in auto.  That was one thing I worried about when buying this.It has a nice built in crossover so you can choose the frequencies you want coming out of the sub.  Right in the middle is good for me.  I may change my opinion later though.  The built in 100 watt (50watt RMS) amp seems sufficient to me.  It literally rattles a mirror inside my house and I have this in my garage.  (don't ask I spend quite a bit of time in my workshop in the garage)  I paired it with 2 full range 3-way Yamaha bookshelf speakers and overall it sounds amazing.  I recommend testing this or any sub with the song "Can you hear me" by Bass Dominator. (even from youtube if you wish)  In fact there are tons of "bass test" songs on youtube but this one is not as annoying as some and doesn't have profanity or really annoying lyrics.  This is subjective though.The nice thing about a 10" sub is that it can hit some deep lows but has really good bass response.  (a 12 may hit low tones a bit harder but may be muddier and less responsive)  This pushes quite a bit of air though.  I can feel it in my body a few feet away.That being said you can easily calm this thing down by lowering the bass setting on your receiver or simply turning down the volume knob on the back of the unit.  I would almost consider this the equivalent of a gain control on a car amp.Now I didn't really read the specs or think much about the size of the ported box but when it arrived I was surprised since it is so large.  This isn't a bad thing though.  Ported boxes must have more cubic feet than a non-ported box so I'm not sure what I was thinking.  To be honest what I was thinking was that this thing is only $100.00 so it can't be real big.  I was wrong.  I don't have much recent experience with Polk Audio but after this purchase I wouldn't hesitate to consider them for my future speaker needs.  I'm not some super high end audiophile but I'm not a person who can listen to cheap bluetooth speakers or use the built in speakers on my phone.  I like quality sound and lots of bass.  I'm happy.  For example I require headphones from Audio Technica or studio headphones and I am a big fan of Bose.My plan originally was to use the cubes from a Bose accoustimass system with this sub but the full range speakers sound much better.  I was missing the mids with the Bose cubes.  The original Bose sub must be putting out quite a bit of midrange and I have this set to the middle on the crossover.  Those Bose may end up being across my garage on the speaker B channel where their harshness won't be so close to my head.The Yamaha speakers I am using are MS-6490 and I've always liked how they sounded.  I used to have Infinity bookshelves however that had an amazing amount of bass.  The tweeter blew on one of those and they are hard to find for a reasonable price.  I missed the bass from the Infinity speakers but this setup has way more bass than those speakers did.  I feel like I have a 4-way setup with this sub and those Yamaha 3-way speakers.  Normally I'm a big fan of 2-way speakers but I don't mind 3 way from Yamaha.  (it isn't necessary always better to have 3-way speakers)I've been looking at these for quite a while and the reviews kept them on the top of my list.  I finally pulled the trigger and I do not regret it.
5,I bought this subwoofer to complete a 2.1 setup for my home office and it exceeded my expectations. Of course adding a subwoofer adds bass but I am very impressed with how it fleshes out the overall sound system and adds body that my bookshelf speakers could not provide alone.
5,Easy to hookup. Easy to balance to the system. Volume is easily adjusted. Sounds quality is superb. Great price.
5,Very happy that I added this subwoofer onto my system.  Really improves the sound.  Much deeper/fuller/richer..  Got it on a great sale so that helped.  Seems well made.  Wish I had bought one years ago.  My only suggestion is to move the power switch from the back to a more visible and accessible location.  Highly recommend.
5,You can't go wrong with this sub for the price. Period. That's really all that need be said. I have a pair of large floorstanding Infinity SM152 with 15" woofers. They play the upper bass beautifully but there is a hole in the bottom end where they drop off. This subwoofer pics up perfectly where the speakers leave off. It all blends together and is not directional once you have it dialed in something that is a process for most of us. I've been using mine almost 6 months now and the better I dial it in (occasional tiny tweeks now) the more I love this thing. It is the perfect compliment to my two channel stereo setup. Unless you're talking really expensive and powerful stuff this is all you need right here. Would work great in a double subwoofer setup as well. Not paid for these 5 stars. Earned.
5,Bought this to drown out my stupid inconsiderate apartment neighbors' late night bass music through my walls elephant stomping on my ceiling and dog barking. All that lower frequency noise pollution cuts right through my box fan but this baby makes it disappear like magic. I can finally sleep again!Two notes for other casual shoppers: this thing is giant. I didn't look very closely at the description or reviews (that's how desperate I was for bass white noise) so when it arrived I was shocked by its size. See my picture of it next to my 12 lb cat for comparison. Secondly if you plan to use auxiliary with it make sure to get an RCA to aux cable rather than a regular aux cord.
5,The only dislike I have is that this was supposed to be New ... It was a used one .. it has been repacked and fingerprints all over it .. I didn't pay full price tho so that is the only reason I didn't send it back .. If the advert would have said Openbox I wouldn't have bought it. "New" means "Never Used"!!! keyword Used ... But it is an awesome product would for sure buy again.
5,For the price the quality is way way beyond. Excellent !
5,Works great. Recommend highly.  You will not be disappointed
4,I actually own two of these. The bigger one is hooked up in the basement to a Carver receiver. It's the 12-in version. The sound is incredible. You can actually feel the wooden porch vibrating. The PSW 10 is upstairs in the den connected to a smaller Yamaha receiver. The PSW10 is perfect for the small room. Drives the wife crazy. I don't think she particularly appreciates the China rattling in the cupboard. LOL!!!Seriously though. We watch quite a few movies together in the den and it's almost like going to the show. You feel and hear everything. Gunshots airplanes taking off explosions ect...You will not find a better subwoofer at this price point...
4,This is a good little sub and a great value. But it has two eccentricities: First you probably need a single RCA male to double RCA male Y-splitter cable to get the signal from your sub out on most AV receivers to the sub. For some reason the sub does not have a standard single RCA LFE input but instead has a stereo (left and right channel) RCA input. Second although it has an "auto" on function that does not seem to work well. It did not work for me and I see other reviews with the same problem. So I just leave it on all the time which isn't ideal but is better than not having bass when you want it.
5,Sub sound good. Make music boom.
5,Plain and simple don't let the size or price fool you. This sub hits hard and crisp. Music movies games all get that deep rich "oomph" you're looking for.
4,Not exactly the Velodyne 1000W 12" sub in my theater room but I have one of these Polk units in my garage and one in my office and they both provide nice strong bass. A nice compliment to in-ceiling speakers or a sound bar.
5,Easy to hook up works great with my 500w /reciever .
5,Bottom Line: I wanted to add some good loud rumbly bass to my system and I'm definitely very pleased - amazed even - by the PSW10. If you are on a tight budget or just don't want to spend more than the price of this sub I think you'll probably be very happy with it.I did a bit of research prior to getting this. It was a bit of an impulse buy; when the price dropped to around $80 shipped via Prime I just couldn't pass it up. I had been eyeing it for a while and just pulled the trigger on a whim.I gotta say.....for the price - anywhere near under or just over $100 I would have to hear another sub for myself to believe it could be beat at this price point or anywhere near it. This is just a fantastic value and in my non-audiophile opinion you'd just *have* to spend significantly more to get something measurably better.After I ordered it I did even more reading and over-analyzing and it looks like the only other sub that's highly recommended by audiophiles anywhere near this price range is the Bic F12 as of this writing it's right about $200 on Amazon.We're not talking about a lot of money even at $200 but that is still double the price most people paid for the PSW10. Does the Bic really sound twice as good - 100% better? I'd love to hear it that's for sure! Also the Bic is 475 watts and 12 inches; this 10 inch 50 watt Polk has me turning it down more often than not and I'm the type who asks for overkill and then double that. For the small room I have the Polk in the Bic likely would have shaken my house down already.Now when you start reading about subs particularly units like the Bic you'll stumble onto real audiophile forums and reviews. I can understand how someone who's used to a $500 sub as a bottom-barrel unit could turn their nose up at the PSW10 but it's also not even close to a fair comparison. I did get pretty nervous & got some bad buyers remorse when I read the negative reviews on some of the audiophile forums but again; they're not comparing apples to apples. These guys are used to subs costing thousands of dollars.This Polk PSW10 gets very loud and contrary to a lot of the reviews I've read handles movies really well in the limited tests I've put it through; War of the Worlds Jurassic Park Terminator Salvation; all these movies just aren't the same without a good loud sub as with one and in my opinion it sounds fantastic playing them.Look maybe I'm not even qualified to comment on this other than to say that if the Polk can sound as good and loud as it does for the price I paid I would absolutely melt if I heard a higher-priced sub. This Polk gets loud adds punch when needed rumble and boom when called upon.....what more is there?Maybe someday I'll upgrade to a more expensive unit but for now I think this Polk is an absolute steal for the price and I'm thrilled with it.Also I'm using it in a pretty small (maybe 15x20) room with hardwood floors obviously if you have carpet or a larger room that greatly affects acoustics.I will also say this: if you have anything resembling a decent stereo system but either don't have a dedicated sub or yours is not that great you are truly missing out on an entire dimension of your movies & music.This is paired with an old Toshiba SD-6109C receiver & 5-channel Energy speaker system.UPDATE 4/22/2014:It's been almost 2 months that I've owned this Polk sub and I'm still very happy with it. In a fit of panic that I wasn't shaking the walls of my home or annoying my fiancee enough I went to return it and purchase the Bic 12" instead. However I had missed the return window by a couple days.It's all well...more often than not I'm turning this thing down and the sound does seem to have improved over time and with use which is normal for speakers & subs to break in.I really think anything larger louder & more powerful would be way way way overkill for my purposes; and I'm the type who goes for overkill and then asks for more.Overall I'm very pleased with this Polk at any price but especially the price I snagged it for.
5,I needed a replacement subwoofer and this fit the bill. It matches my other Polk Blackstone speaker components. The setup is easy and it has multiple options for both speaker level input and line input. This is used in my basement man cave with an older Sony receiver. It only had speaker level outputs and works great with the subwoofer. Sound quality is also good. It’s not like the $400 Polk reference subwoofer I use with my main tv but it comes pretty close. Fit and finish are also good. I should get a lot of use of this in my man cave watching movies while exercising.
5,I get amazing low frequency sounds coming from this modestly priced Subwoofer. Under  my testing it seems to stop at about 30 Hz. The balance of its performance is excellent. It allowed me to extend the sound coming from my other speakers to much lower frequencies. Highly recommend it.
5,I been a fan of Polk for many years. I grew up with huge SDAs in my house as my Dad was a fan. When I got out on my own I ended up getting my own Polks - albeit the thinner towers and bookshelfs. I'm also a fan of KEFs but they tend to be harder to find and a lot more expensive. Polks are quite easy to find at a discount or second-hand. Just before this purchase I owned 9 Polk speakers. I been using non-Polks for the subwoofer - Wharfdales + ones that come with the 5.1 compact home theaters made by Philips and Samsung. The Wharfdale Zaldek Subwoofer was a nice one - but it died many years ago - first always humming then finally the power board going up in a poof of smoke. I had used it passively - using the output from the 5.1 receiver - but overall neither of these solutions was satisfactory. If they were I wouldn't have been looking online for subwoofers.Here is this Polk Subwoofer for seemingly half-price of what it should be - only a little bit more than a used unit - and seemingly direct from Polk through Amazon. Looking through the reviews it seems most people are pleased. There is the odd defect - and some reviews are negative because they are downgrading from a more esoteric system - and most are pleased. On youtube are reviews that this definitely can annoy your neighbors if that's your thing. I took the plunge.The sub arrived the next day (Prime). There's a hole punched in the side of the box but it didn't damage the sub.This thing rocks.It's an upgrade to my system and goes very nicely with the Tsi300 fronts I have. The center and rears are also Polks but I haven't been watching much TV - cranking the music and enjoying the big bottom I had been missing. It's as if my previous solution was missing all the lower harmonics. I don't know if it's distortion  - meaning it's not a part of the original recording - but it's harmonic and sounds good and not fuzzy.I have to turn it quite a bit down - I have the volume knob at around 11 o'clock - which would be about a 4/10 on their scale. I have the filter wide open. It complements the front speakers quite well - sonically as well as visually since both are black. Any higher in volume and it sounds unnatural although it's still clean. This thing can fart like those bass shaker car stereos but that's not my thing. If you want it thumping and unscrewing your drywall screws turn the frequency to the lowest then turn the knob to 11/10. Don't sue me if you blow up your unit as this is not advice but a tongue-and-cheek comment on this unit's versatility.I bought 2 one for each speaker - but one is enough. I'll use the 2nd one for another room. Heck got to be sneaky and see if my Dad needs one since I'm sure he still is listening in 2.0.
5,Packaging was great. no issues with any damage from shipping which seems the norm now. Unpacked and set up in minutes. Fantastic range and control. Nice limited footprint. You cannot go wrong with this Sub.
5,This subwoofer performs way better than I was actually expecting. I was wondering if I would really be able to tell the difference between this speaker and the small subwoofer that came with my Onkyo "home theatre  in a box" The answer is an emphatic YES...like night and day. Deep tight gut thumping bass. Be sure to keep it away from electronics like TVs air conditioners etc.
5,Paired this up with some Emotiva B1+ Speakers and an SMSL AO200 Amp.  Crystal clear sound and have the Polk sitting at 1/4 volume just to fill in the low end as smaller bookshelfs.
5,Love the sound of the bass given from this subwoofer as I have it replacing the original subwoofer that came with my surround sound system. It has made my inferior surround sound system sound like a movie theater and or concert hall depending on what we are watching from videos to movies. Maximum volume is too much for my 20×15 foot viewing area. Love it
5,The Polk Audio PSW10 is a great buy. It offers both Line-in and LFE inputs. For those who experience a humming or buzz when using LFE mode may want to consider investing in an RCA cable with ground wire (ground it at the receiver). The auto on/off feature is a bonus. Totally happy with this purchase. Highly recommended best value for the purchase price. For information on LFE input refer to the product manual.
3,Based on all the great reviews I was expecting a bit more from this Sub.  I have 2 Polk Monitor 60's for front CS1 Center and Monitor 30's for surrounds.  My Monitor 60's go head to head with this sub and have better characteristics on all but the lowest frequencies that this sub handles.  While the unit is taking some of the load from my speakers you would be better served going with a higher quality sub based on my own music and movie tests. The good news is the sub does perform well overall but will not give the cleanest sounding bass response.  For movies it does add some punch but for music I found its characteristics particularly lacking.  I started with my sub at 1/3 and adjusted up to half volume and then calibrated my system.  I did not want to overpower the sub and have the bass sound become too boomy.  Unfortunately even at these modest settings the PSW10 while sounding good does not add much additional range as my front Channels can hit 38Hz.  I tried the THX standard of 80Hz crossover to relive my towers from having to hit the lower frequencies.  All in All for the price its not bad but if you can afford it I would recommend stepping up to the PSW-505 or a similar 12" Sub that has a bit more range.From the research I've done if you want an ultra high quality sub for music the SVS SB 1000 series is an outstanding value but runs about 500$.  If you have smaller speakers and need this to fill out the low end it should do the job very well to enhance any sat speaker system on a budget.  The PSW10 is still a good value but for my purposes it just didn't add much to my setup.  I tested using many types of music and most sounded good however anything with low frequencies just didn't sound as clean as I like.  For the price I paid I will keep the unit and eventually upgrade and use this to add the lower end to my other TV.  Outstanding value overall for a basic sub to add some thump to movies but in my opinion just doesn't have the range to add depth when paired with good tower speakers your mileage may vary and with some adjusting it can sound acceptable for part of the range it handles.  It will miss some of the really low range that you may want for HT use.  In my tests sound of the low end spectrum did vary for anything with ultra deep frequencies it was muddied and if you put it even at 50% volume you will get port noise(Polk recommended to set between 12 and 2)\ on the volume) but that was too much in my tests and created really boomy and poor sound.  For anything in moderately deep areas it did well enough to add some depth but will certainly not compete with a sub 3X its price which in reality no one should expect it to.  You get what you pay for holds true for this sub despite all the great reviews good value as an entry SW but don't expect this unit to bring out subtle characteristics in music.  If your expectations are right you should be happy with the value it brings.  I have already ordered the Dayton Sub-1200 to replace this unit as it just doesn't work well for my tower speakers also setting the towers to 60Hz really filled out the sound effects in my room.  They can hit down to 38Hz but not cleanly so I adjusted to keep the sound as level as possible so my frequency response is good. I will update this review with additional information once I have the Dayton 12" fully calibrated and tested which from what I read competes with well with the PSW505 which is double the price.Update: After dropping sub back to 1/3 power it blends well with my tower speakers for movie watching.  I tested using action intense movies including helicopter flyby's in Transformers and it worked well for this.  I also have a large room approximately 20X17 with vaulted ceilings and the kitchen and second floor is also open to this room.  The sub fills the sound stage in the whole family room with only one slight dead spot which is impressive considering my room is so open.  I do recommend for HT movie watching but cant give a good rating for music.  If movies are 90% of what you use it for then this sub is a bargain for what it does.  Keep in mind though there are a few other subs also rated with slightly better range in this price category including the Dayton sub-1000 and sub-1200.  Some reviewers of the Sub1200 are saying its comparable to the Polk PSW505 which if its even close to that it is a steal.  Any louder then 1/3 volume on the PSW10 for me causes the sub to be boomy and not blend so if your looking for just a descent boost without needing earth trembling bass its a good price and matches well with Polk speakers.  For me based on my research the only subs I would consider at this price point would be the PSW10 and the Dayton Sub-1000/Sub-1200.  After that price jumps up quite a bit for the performance gains. Excellent value overall but 3stars for music for me and 4 for HT use as long as you keep the volume low for clean output.**Final update: Well the Dayton Sub-1200 kicks the crud out of the PSW10 clean even at loud levels and is just overall richer and better in low frequency response.  I'm actually sorry I bought the Polk before finding out about the Dayton it does not have the port noise issue in my tests and sounds much better for music as well  I hooked the Polk up to one of my TV's and it sounds even worse then before because its not using the sub out.  I have to keep it at very low volume.  I would return it but its not worth it due to shipping costs.  I believe Polk missed the ball as the port noise is a big issue the other thing about the Dayton is you can crank it up and it doesn't hurt your ears the bass sounds accurate not boomy and painful.  My wife complained about the Polk the bass was not natural and clean like the Sub-1200 which really extends the range of my speakers and hits all the way down to 25Hz.  Really to my the Dayton is the one to get as its the same price and is just so much more woofer for your money.  Some may actually favor the un-natural boominess of the Polk but not me!
5,I just ran regular speaker wire from the Sony stdhr190 receiver to the input clips on the Polk sub and selected speakers a and b together on the receiver. With the Klipsch rp600m and the Polk running together I am loving a wide variety of musical genres from different media sources it just sounds great for 120 bucks. I highly recommend it especially for those getting started with an old school set up or maybe even those who don’t need a 400 watt 12” sub due to space constraints or the shape of their listening room. Couldn’t be happier great value.
4,This is 32 pounds of serious boom-boom-boom power. Definitely the best of the best in this price range and a lot better than several subwoofers that cost a lot more.My setup is as follows:THE CONNECTION: I connected my Polk subwoofer using a 15-foot RCA audio pin cable with a Y splitter at the subwoofer end. I plugged the two ends of the splitter into the L (white) and R (red) RCA sockets at the back of the subwoofer and ran the other end to the Pre Out subwoofer jack on my receiver. This form of connection was recommended by my receiver's manual and it only took a couple minutes to accomplish. Alternately I could've run my front speakers through the subwoofer using speaker wire instead of using the RCA cable. However this option would've required several dozen yards of additional speaker wire and more than a day of extra work. I like my home theater system but not that much. The RCA connection works just fine.THE RECEIVER: Mine is a Yamaha TSR-5830 Network AV Receiver (7.2 channel) which requires a "powered subwoofer" and plays very nicely with this particular Polk.PLACEMENT OF THE SPEAKERS: I have four speakers mounted in the ceiling (in the front and surround-back positions) a center-channel speaker that sits underneath the TV and two free-standing front speakers on bookshelves mounted to the extreme right and left of the TV.PLACEMENT OF THE SUBWOOFER: The Polk manual recommends placing the subwoofer to the left or right of the TV. In my house the left is the only possible location so I placed the subwoofer behind my sectional couch which doglegs left of the TV. The subwoofer is situated so that the speaker faces sideways/parallel to the back of the couch and toward the back of the room (away from the TV). I sandwiched the sides of the subwoofer between the wall and couch and set the subwoofer atop a stout platform I built from plywood and doweling (it stands about 5-inches high). I also cushioned the bottom and sides of the subwoofer with 1-inch-thick acoustic foam to dull any vibrations but mostly to prevent damage from being done to the wall and/or the couch in the event the couch gets shoved back accidentally.THE ADJUSTMENTS: My receiver is equipped with an acoustic optimizer function that automatically detects speaker and subwoofer connections measures the distances and adjusts the settings accordingly. However even with all this tech the Polk subwoofer still required a few manual adjustments. In my case I had to set the Low Pass filter knob to 160 (the same as turning it all the way clockwise) and to set the Phase Switch to 0º. Both of these are located at the back of the subwoofer. Your settings may vary. Check the Polk manual and the manual for your receiver.FINE TUNING: Because this is such a powerful little boom-boom-boom box I found it necessary to turn the volume knob on the back of the subwoofer to half power. Any more than that makes the dishes rattle in the cupboard.CONS: The subwoofer is equipped with an on/off/auto switch. The auto function is supposed to detect the receiver when in use and automatically power on the subwoofer. Conversely it's also supposed to power off the subwoofer when not in use. The auto-off function works fine for me but for whatever reason the auto-on doesn't work for me. It's not a big deal because I prefer to switch the powered subwoofer off completely when not in use. For this reason I plugged it into a wall socket that's on a wall switch making it easy to power on and off. If you plan to place your subwoofer in a hard-to-reach location access to the on-off-auto switch at the back of the unit could be an issue for you so plan accordingly.OVERALL: It's only been six weeks but I'm very pleased with my purchase so far.
5,This is an excellent subwoofer for a small room.
5,Great great speaker great buy
4,When I first got it in and unpacked it I thought they sent me the wrong item.  This Sub-Woof was much larger and heavier then the one I purchased this one seemed like a substantial upgrade but it really was what I ordered and so far I'm several months with it and it has exceeded my expectations.  Having said that I do live in an apartment so my expectations have a low bar for this reason.  Overall I really like the unit but I also realize it is a bit of overkill for my current needs. lol
5,Wow.Introduction:For many years I have been a basshead not in the juvenile sense of subs at 11 but in the sense that I absolutely *love* clean powerful bass. In everything I own from headphones to car audio to home theater to my desk setup I have to have clean agile powerful deep silky bass and the Polk PSW10 delivers.In addition to the PSW10 my PC desk system includes:  Micca COVO-S Compact 2-Way Bookshelf Speakers          SMSL Q5 Pro(black) Audio Component Amplifier          Mediabridge ULTRA Series Fast-Lock 45° Spade Plugs - 6 Pair Per Package - (Part# SPC-ST2-6 )          Mediabridge Banana Plugs - Corrosion-Resistant 24K Gold-Plated Connectors - 7 Pair/14 Banana Plugs (Part# SPC-BP2-7 )          AmazonBasics 1-Male to 2-Male RCA Audio Cable - 8 Feet          AmazonBasics 16-Gauge Speaker Wire - 100 Feet        Connections/setup:I used the above 1-male to 2-male RCA cable to connect the subwoofer output from the SMSL Q5 Pro amplifier to the two RCA inputs on the PSW10. I have read multiple conflicting statements on how the inputs work on various subwoofers this one included some people indicate you can use a coaxial subwoofer cable to just one of the inputs but I decided to use the 1-2 cable for good measure.I have set the crossover fairly high as the Micca COVO-S speakers are very tiny and can't reach very low I should probably upgrade the speakers to something with better frequency coverage but  the takeaway here is that the PSW10 is extremely capable at filling in the lower midbass range up to the 140Hz setting I have the PSW10 set at as well as being adept at handling the lower frequencies with ease the power doesn't drop off when the sub reaches way down low and doesn't get muddy at the quick transitions. I am very impressed with the performance for such a low price!! I honestly didn't have any high or low expectations just kept and open mind.Music styles:House bass heavy Basement Jaxx Griz and the like are awesome the silky clean bass fills and envelopes you with these styles of music.Steely Dan's Aja sounds a bit unnatural and I found myself tweaking the setup to get this sounding good. Turning the sub volume down and tweaking the EQ in software mellowed it out this sub is very eager and needs to be restrained at times but works very well once adjusted.Rage Against the Machine's self titled album also performed well with the PSW10 producing the punchy kick drum very realistically at at parts where there is a lot going on in the low end between the bass guitar and drums the PSW10 was able to keep up.Build quality is top notch nicely finished cabinet the front grille is a little flimsy as this sits under my desk and I occasionally bump it with my foot hoping the thin fabric covered plastic grille will hold up over time.Overall I am not qualified enough to recommend something else but for acoustic music and other instrumental styles you may want to look at other options I feel that I had to do a fair amount of tweaking to get those styles sounding good each time resulting in adjustments that restrained the PSW10 to keep it from overpowering the style. Nothing wrong with that approach at all in my opinion better to have too much and tone it down than not enough and have to strain the system to get what you want. If you listen to house tech electronic drum and bass etc this sub will suit you very well out of the box! Love it.
5,I was looking to boost the bass and low end of music with my old 90's era Pioneer componenet system.  Last year my old tower speakers died and I replaced with Polk bookshelf speakers.  The sound was good but lacked the low end deep bass.  I thought about a sub as my home theater system has one and what a difference it makes!This Polk 10" sub is attractive easy to use and pretty easy to figure out hooking up.  I had to run my Speaker A wires to the speaker input jacks on the sub then run my bookshelf speakers out from the output speaker jacks.  Took me a few minutes to figure out that I had to do this.  But once done the sound came to life.  Just a couple turns of the knobs and I dialed in just what I was looking for.  Sounds great at low volume levels but sounds even more impressive when played loud.This will bring the bass guitar rhythm guitar bass drum and some toms to life!  Really gives my music the driving beat I love to hear.  Pretty happy with this purchase for the low price of $149.Would highly recommend!
5,I agree with the others who have posted here.  If your budget maxes out at $100 bucks then this is the sub to get.  Yes Five out of Five stars in its category.  Sure it's not a $1600 digitally-driven Velodyne but by gosh and by golly this little sub still has the potential to put a big smile on your face.I have it paired with a set of Andrew Jones bookshelf speakers (another great value) and my old NAD amplifier (via the high-level speaker in/outs) and it sits near the front right corner in my bsmnt workshop.  Note: if you're not getting the sound you're expecting out of your subwoofer then the first thing to do is to adjust its position.  After that fine tune the crossover (in your receiver if you're hooked to the LFE out) and finally the volume.Oh if you're hearing a little rattling coming from the sub at high output levels check the front grille.  Mine buzzes when pushed hard so I just permanently removed it.I play mostly music through this little setup (as it's in my workshop and I don't want to cut my thumb off  :-)  ) but I did hook the sub up (solo) to my 7.2 Home Theater system for a while to test it with movies (two of my favorite scenes are the opening battle engagement in Master & Commander: FSOTW and also the Limo/Plane escape scene in 2012.  Yowza!).  I must say that this little 10" did a pretty passable job (best in a corner again) but admittedly in a 600 sq ft room it didn't have the output to match the pair of 12" PSW505's that I normally have hooked to my HT system.  I think the PSW10 would do well in a smaller room though.As far as music is concerned I've really come to enjoy it for what it is (I certainly had my doubts when ordering though given the lower specs than what I'm used to).  But it seems to handle everything I've thrown at it very nicely from Gaga's pounding monster beat in "Marry the Night - Zed remix" to her very visceral track "Teeth" Wow!!!  On to Al DiMeola's sizzling guitar in "Splendido Hotel"  and the electronic mastery of Jean Michel Jarre's "Concerts in China."How about Trance - you'll just love Infected Mushroom's "Army of Mushrooms" or Cosmic Gate's "Earth Mover" when played through a sub.  Or remember Disco?  (yes that kinda dates me hehe!)  Santa Esmeralda "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"  is IMHO one of the best dance LPs ever produced.  Note: keep in mind that your speakers and esp your amp have to be up to the task as well  :-)Rock Pop Country Easy Listening etc aren't generally as demanding of a sub as some of the music I've mentioned but yes this sub reproduces it all with some pretty good authority (remember move the sub if it's just not cutting it and re-check your phase all around!).  This sub is the real thing and it should thump pretty darn hard for you.Yet the PSW10 is still accurate and mellow enough for Yo-Yo Ma's cello or Rodrigo y Gabriela's wonderful dueling acoustic guitars in "9 Dead Alive."  And if you really want a good test check out Sheffield Lab's "Drum and Track Disk."  You will not be disappointed.  I played it again today and I'm STILL smiling.  :-)  :-)  :-)Good luck and happy listening!  J&H
4,Bass quality is great for the price.
4,I like the size but the bass is not strong it distorts if turned up. I have gone thru all settings on my receiver an Onkyo txnr-696 and it still is weak. I am considering returning them as I just don't feel satisfied. I have other polk speakers and they are great sounding but I wanted more bass.
5,I'm really pleased with this. My use case is in an office which is fairly small. About 10.5x9. I'm using the speaker level inputs and outputs.Bass response: I don't consider myself a basshead or anything but I've owned a couple of lower-middle end car subs in the past that had multiple times the RMS of this so I was initially a little concerned if it would deliver sufficient bass. Comparing home audio bass and car audio bass is probably apples and oranges but that's my only point of comparison. Anyway for the price point as well as a trustworthy brand I figured I'd give it a shot. Well those concerns were unfounded. It's more than adequate for this space and could manage something a fair bit larger I'd think. Now by adequate I mean enough to really round out the lows and enough to feel it if you push it a little. If you're looking to shatter your windows or something this isn't it.Audio quality: It's great. Bass comes through clearly. I can't hear any distortion. Also no discernible loss in volume or audio quality from the speakers connected to the output of this as instead of directly to the amp.Connectivity: Another thing I liked about this was how versatile it is to connect via line level RCA inputs or speaker level wire inputs. Easy to integrate with a system that doesn't have a dedicated sub output. Though inversely it does not have an LFE connection. The manual suggests in this case to hook that up to L or R or use a y splitter and do both then turn the low pass filter as high as it goes.Functionality: It has volume low pass and phase switch all of which I'd expect. It has an auto off feature though which maybe this common feature for home powered amps I don't know. But if used it turns the amp off after 15 minutes of no signal which I like.Aesthetics: I mean yeah it's just a black box but it looks nice. The little hint of silver from the front face that you can see around the grill is a nice touch.
5,I initially purchased one of these Polk Audio subwoofers for our home theater sound system. It sounded okay but I really wanted a little more bottom end. Then I read an article in a pro audio magazine about trying two subwoofers rather than one. So I purchased a second one of these and... WOW! What a difference! Probably it depends on your own room but in my case it really made a huge improvement. Maybe try one and then decide for yourself. It's a very good product. Good value for the money.
5,Great Entry Level Sub I wouldn't buy anything cheaper or you'll probably end up with rattles.  If my place gets robbed I didn't spend much.  Some people reported port noise which is said to be fixed by the Polk PSW108 (same unit with a face color reversal and more money $)I have not experience any port noise however I am a grown up who listens to music not c-Rap and I don't throw raves or even house parties......but I also read the port noise issue can be fixed by stuffing a piece of breathable foam in there which will not decrease sound quality at all.  I like the face color of the 108 better (when the grill is off) but it is the same unit for more money.Oh alright I admit I boogie to the kitchen instead of walking when Tupac's "California" comes on in a commercial or something but for the most part I don't like rap (violence rhymes) nor someone screaming at me for that matter (punk/metal)So most of my listening is easy listening old school mo-town classic rock even some disco yeah I was a double agent in the war on Disco.  (Well me and my Zeppelin friends got tired of holding a chick's hair when they puked and started sneaking over to the Starwood to meet the dance chicks instead) practiced with my sister's ABBA album first.Anyway I listen to all this plus blues smooth jazz accustic piano guitar etc at medium or lower volumes even cranked it way up a couple time just for tests did not hear any port noise and did not need to stuff a piece of foam in there.I use it with a pair of old Bose 201s.I'm on a budget but don't want junk.I got a deal on a 2nd Polk Sub (this time the 108) and scooped it up quick for my office and use with a pair of vintage solid cherry wood SP-UX7000 (if you see these speakers at a thrift store get them!) amazing sound for such a small speaker.Bottom line for the price and the decent quality of Polk it's a good sub for even my living room.  Clean & Punchy totally improves the music experience.
4,I purchased this sub to replace the Sony SA-SC9 because the Sony just didn't cut it for me--and I'm so glad I did!  This sub plays the lows really smoothly. It doesn't get too thumpy or just too silent during movie dialog etc.  Just the perfect companion for an inexpensive sound system.  I have two medium- size bookshelf front speakers and the sub complements my two speakers nicely. I still don't have the surround speakers but with only three my system sounds great.  I have an older Yamaha receiver with 100w/channel so it's the perfect combo.  I really don't think that for the money you pay for this sub you can get anything better to tell you the truth.  Like I mentioned I tried the more expensive Sony and ended up being quite a disappointment even though it was supposed to have more power (115 W) and a better crossover with a range of 35 - 200 Hz.This sub is manufactured with great quality components you can tell right away by looking an feeling them.  The port in the front complements the soft lows better than a back-ported one--at least from I could discern from the Sony.  Also it comes with an "Auto/On/Off" switch which is super convenient when you just turn off your receiver and don't want to turn off the sub.  It took me a while to figure out that this switch had three positions ("Auto" "On" "Off").  The "Auto" goes off after a few minutes of silence although I haven't figure out how many exactly. The manual says 15 min. but I've checked the "On" green light after half hour or so and it's still on.  On the other hand this sub even though it's 10 in it belts out tight home-theater bass and sounds really really sweet with music too!The reason I'm giving this sub 4 stars is because the crossover range could have been a bit more "generous" as with other (albeit more expensive) subs.  Yeah I think 80 - 160 Hz is a bit too tight.  I'd think 60 - 180 Hz would have been much better.  Finally the fact that this sub has still two audio-in RCA jacks as opposed to just one is perhaps a testament of how old this model is (2004?). I did have to spring for a "Y" adapter to connect the sub cable to the receiver although it wasn't a big deal. Don't take me wrong even though this sub has been around the block for quite some time it doesn't mean it's obsolete it's just that there's obviously new technologies/materials that have been developed ever since 2004 that are being used very successfully.  In addition this sub's missing is a direct input that bypasses the sub's internal crossover. Again not sure if you can find a sub that does that for within this price range.  Anyway all in all this sub is great if your system is not high-end or if it's in a small room (like mine). It's great for movies and even better for music!
5,These Polk PSW-10's subs are amazing sounding while also being an amazing value. You can spend a lot of money on a high-end sub these days and end up being unhappy with the result. I would say this is especially true if you are buying primarily for music use over home theater use.Many of the higher end subs out there which totally slam for movies in a properly setup home theater tend to not work nearly as well when using in 2 channel stereo systems or when using stereo modes of a HT system. Not exactly sure why this is and it's certainly not true for all of them out there but I've heard enough of them to know that it's a thing. There are also many variables in setup and balancing but if you've done your due diligence and are still unhappy then consider getting or adding the Polk PSW-10 to your setup.I like these so much that I've bought 4 of them for different setups over the years. Currently I'm using 1 in my desktop system paired with a pair of vintage Advent A1122's. Using another for a small bathroom setup with a pair of Advent mini's. And finally I'm using 2 of them crossed over via speaker level inputs to a pair of Elac Uni-Fi UB5's in my stereo only listening room setup. Simply speaking I went with the Polk's (over and over again) because they don't get in the way of the music they just work with what's there to fill in the bottom. They are musical sounding rather than 'explosive' sounding.Other subs I've heard and a few that I've tried just overtake the music coming from your mains drowning out the details no matter where you cross them or how low you set the volume. So if you are looking for an affordable solution to fill out the bottom end of your 2 channel system or are looking to start using your home theater for movies AND music consider adding one or more of these gems from Polk. You will not regret the purchase.
5,I looked for a long time probably months before I decided on a sub and passive speakers for my setup.. I watched alot of videos about this specific subwoofer and almost all of them were positive.  I personally think they were all understated on how good this thing sounds paired with the right amp and speaker combination.  Even though this is a self powerd subwoofer the sound is rich and deep and completely customizable to whatever your taste is. I listen to all types of music from classic rock all the way through k-pop and this subwoofer has yet to make ANY of them sound less than incredible. Fyi I have a pretty simple setup with a Fosi audio amplifier and two jamo s803 bookshelf speakers .. this sub  a must buy for a budget or any midrange setup.
5,Tue 2/15/2022 8:35 pm. I'm not an expert in subwoofers -- or any kind of hifi really -- but I've bought two Polk subwoofers in my life and they make a good thump and appear to be the cheapest. The first one I got was for my ridiculous home electronic organ 11 years ago or so -- and it's still going strong -- and the second recent one for a Yamaha arranger keyboard with which it seems to work good.The only wisdom I can provide is that the NON-subwoofer sound *should* be modified so that it *doesn't* have a lot of bass content. I haven't used the Polk with the high-level output of an amplifier as the input to the Polk where one connects one's existing speakers to the Polk speaker terminals provided for that purpose. The Polk is supposed to provide the requisite frequency modification for its speaker outputs. I've only used the "auxiliary" level ("RCA") inputs to the Polk: my Yamaha keyboard has a special subwoofer setting for that and I've apparently done my beloved electronic organ wrong for a decade or so....
5,I don't have my new home theater setup completely yet. I had an old Kenwood receiver driving two 100 watt Kenwood floor speakers two 80 watt JBL bookshelf speakers and two small generic surround speakers. All of this was hooked up with an xbox and a over the air receiver box to pick up local tv hooked up to a HD projector. My kids mainly played the xbox and when they played HALO Call of Duty or the other 1st person shooter games it sounded like thunder outside. But now with the new technology out there such as my brand new Denon AV receiver I have 5 HDMI inputs getting rid of all those wires to and from the projector to get sound. All of the sound comes through the HDMI inputs and goes directly to the speakers. My Denon AV receiver has two subwoofer outputs and I wanted to take advantage of that. I purchased a Polk Audio PSW108 sub and then I saw the PSW10 was a little cheaper so I also purchased that and today I decided to temporarily fire it up to see if the bass was as good as my older system. My wife and kids had already started eating dinner and when I shut everything down and went up stairs(my theater is setup in my basement) they said they heard it and felt the floor shake. Now over the summer I just had my kitchen tiled with nice heavy Italian porcelain tile so when they told me they felt it through the floor even I was impressed. If you're on the fence get off it and buy it. I posted a picture of the PSW10 and PSW108. The PSW10 is on the right and the PSW108 on the left and it looks a little bigger although they are both 10" subwoofers. I just hooked them up to test the sound and bass and it was impressive. Make sure if your hooking up two subs that the phase switches are opposite as I have my PSW108 set at 0° and my PSW10 set at 180°. If not they will cancel each other out.
5,Bought the PSW10 with the intention to fill out my Vanatoo Transparent One bookshelf speakers on a gaming/music-server PC in my office. The PSW10 has one RCA sub out and the Polk has stereo RCA pair input. My OCD couldn't connect only one channel on a sub that handles two inputs so I matched this with a Mediabridge Ultra Series RCA Y-Adapter from Amazon. Plenty of length and the Y solved all my OCD issues.The sound is magnificent. I worked a bit to get the sub volume control set appropriately after turning the low pass filter to max on the PSW10. This was important; I wanted to minimize any weirdness from combining the low frequency filters from the Vanatoo and PSW10. Placement options are limited in my office so the woofer is essentially at my feet and the speakers are at ear level; however setting relative levels was easy. Once I learned where to find the volume control by touch I could reach behind the PSW10 and adjust it to my heart's content.After a few weeks  of rocking out with the Vanatoos at my desk I tested the PSW10 with some Magnepan MMG speakers I found for a friend. The MMGs are small planar magnetic panels that demanded bass reinforcement. The PSW10 served very well. It filled out the low end without boominess or muffled bass to detract from the clarity of the planar magnetics. Thumbs up. It took a few days to follow through with my plan to give away the MMGs because they sounded so good with the PSW10 but I finally did with a recommendation that my friend get a PSW10 for himself.The PSW10's success with the planar magnetic panels lead me to think about using the PSW10 with my Acoustat 2+2 electrostatic panels in my bedroom. They have extreme accuracy clarity and openness but they have no low bass extension and I never satisfied with the 6 Hz cannon on the 1812 Overture. So I moved the PSW10 to help the Acoustats. Again after taking some time to get the low pass adjustment properly set the PSW10 was equally successful with electrostatics as it was with the planar magnetics. Bass was full and rich without any feeling of decreased clarity or openness. The 1812 cannons were never so much fun. Bliss bliss and heaven.I couldn't bear to take the PSW10 away from the bedroom so I had to buy a second PSW10 and Y adapter for the original setup in my office. Twice the fun. No regrets.
5,I was looking for an inexpensive subwoofer to put low notes into a bookshelf system. The Polk PW10 / 108 fills the bill and is an excellent value for the price but of course with some caveats.The sound was muddy at first and I considered returning it. But it got a lot better when I added felt pads to isolate the hard rubber feet from my hardwood floor. Before the pads the bass got buzzy when I cranked the subwoofer volume up but now it sounds fine. Moving the speaker from mid-wall to corner also helped.There's a quiet 120 Hz ac hum whenever the speaker is on. It's louder near the floor. The felt pads helped that a bit.I listen mostly to classical music at background levels and got this to add substance to a pair of vintage JBL L20t3's. It does that well. The JBL L20t3's alone start to roll off around 100 Hz and are mostly gone at 50 Hz. Adding this subwoofer it's level to 50 Hz and mostly gone below 32 Hz. Kudos to Polk for actually stating +/- 3db specs on their website. Their 40 -160 Hz seems a tad generous but probably more realistic than other manufacturers.This box is an energy vampire. Even with the power switch off it draws 9 watts or 79 kWh a year. Auto-off draws the same and it isn't turned on by low audio levels. So it's best to plug it into a switched outlet as on a receiver and leave the power switch on.The snap-in grille buckles away from the cheap-looking case at the top and bottom. Maybe this is Polk's idea of styling but it just looks warped.The speaker is packed in molded styrofoam which is almost impossible to recycle. For those of us wishing to keep the box for possible repair or return shipment the foam can not be easily stored. Polk should use foldable cardboard spacers like more up-to-date manufacturers.
5,This is one of the most Detailed subs I have heard . I use it as a Home Studio Sub with a monitor controller and 2 M-Audio BX5a studio monitors . It is crossed over at 80hz and below and my monitors are crossed over at 80hz and above . I just heard my friends Klipsch 12" sub and it sounds boomy compared to this Polk sub . I knew the 10" would be the perfect size to go with my 5.25" monitors and a 10" sub is usually very tight sounding compared to larger subs but big enough to get down to 40hz and below . I bought this sub expecting to have a little bit of boominess but overall good sound because of all the awesome reviews and I had a Polk DX Sub in my car once and it sounded excellent . But back to my point  I have watched movies on this Sub and it gets on down there  I have sound treatment in my room and I have bass traps because it is a studio . But my room is about 15x30x15x30  it is a bit of an L shaped room and the side I use the sub in to mix is about 15x15 and this sub is raised up on a platform built out of wood and topped with a sound deadening pad at about 4ft high . I used it on the floor also just to test it out . Down on the floor with the sub facing you I would say it drops down well into the 30hz and below range . I lifted it up for a tighter sound at ear level with my monitors . But I will say this as a last point . This sub sounds as good or better than some studio subs that cost well in the $300.00 range and it has plenty of punch for a 30x15 room so don't let the 50 watts fool you  it sounds so tight and defined that I almost don't believe that it is sold for this price . I worked for a Home and Car electronics store for about 3 years and I will tell you . No BS ! This is one of the best sound quality subwoofer units I have heard  comparative to subs we sold at 4 and $500.00 bucks back 8 years ago . I believe any audiophile that can hear and has the experience I do with sound will tell you . If you are in this price range this is the best sub in this and higher price ranges . When they built it they done an exceptional job . This is a long review but this Sub and Polk deserve to be a bestseller on Amazon . All I can say is Wow ! With my mouth hanging open when I am playing the 808 drum  or hear a detailed explosion on a movie . This sub does not lose it's precise sound when playing kick drums  toms and bass guitar riffs all together . You can hear the separation of the notes . No mud at all  unless you gap the volume too loud or fire the sub into a corner which I do not suggest . Turn it up a bit past half way and adjust your sub pre out on your reciever and hear it sing . It's unbelievable at this price point and I can't get enough of this sub .
4,You really need to adjust your speakers to get the most out of this sub. I had a higher end sub that went down to mid 20’s so I adjusted my center channel to small and 80 crossover and it made a big difference. I have with Polk monitor 70’s in the living room with height speakers so the wife doesn’t complain about speaker wire…for surround sound. We go to the movie room with dual 12” subs for a blow your socks off experience!
3,I've had the PSW12 for 8 or so years.  It's a very quality SW.Still in use in my living room.I bought this thing for my pool house setup.  Well... not too impressed.  It's a bit muddy sounding and with only a 50 watt RMS amp seems a tad underpowered.I mean for the money this cost it's ok.  Kind of wish I would have spend another fifty on something a little more...  well more.The PSW12 is 3 to 4 times the sub this thing is.
5,Fills out the sound of 5 speakers surroundingly!
3,I purchased Polk Audio RC55i 2-way speakers in my home theater. I purchased this PSW10 subwoofer and I am using this 5.1 amplifier PFA560BT. I connected them all together. Im using the Y connection from the sub to the amplifier RW. i connected the wall in speakers to the amp and once i turned it on there is no bass. Im not sure what else to do. Im not too savy with matching the right equipment. Maybe i need a better amplifier?? if anyone has any ideas please help.
5,I use this for a pinball machine and it still sounds great.  Getting ready for a move though and the two back plastic feet fell apart.  This has been sitting on foam/fabric coasters the whole time with nothing setting on top of the unit so no idea what the problem with these were but the split is evident in the foam coasters so it's been like this for a while.
5,To start off and give you an idea of my setup; I have a Yamaha 100 watt 2 channel/ 50 Watt 4 channel amp connected to 2 Polk Audio T15 100 Watt bookshelf speakers and this subwoofer. The setup is located in a 2 1/2 car detached garage. With the bookshelf speakers at opposite ends of the garage about a foot from the ceiling aiming towards the center of the garage. The subwoofer is on the floor about 20 feet from the side wall and about a foot from the back wall of the garage. I used the speaker level input/outputs. I have the low pass setting at about 1/4 and the volume at about 75%. This thing puts out plenty of sound. When playing something with a lot of bass like rap or hiphop this thing does not miss a note. The sub I am replacing has an 8 inch speaker and it would get a "buzz" or "hiss" when real heavy bass came through it. This one does not miss a note when the bass is heavy and no hiss. I might add that the sub is less than three feet from the amp. I heard you may hear hiss if you don't use shielded cable and have a wire that is longer than four feet. I noticed some of the other reviews mention this. I used a 12 gauge wire and it seems to work fine. When I say fine what I mean is that I won the competition. It seems like all the men in my area are having an unspoken competition consisting of loud cars loud bikes and loud stereos in their garage. I won the loud stereos in the garage competition with this setup. When playing anything with heavy bass this puts out more than enough thump being set at 75%. I rode my bike down the street just to hear how loud it sounds from far away. The bass can be heard relatively well with the garage door open at least three houses down the street. I would definitely recommend this subwoofer to anyone who is looking for decent sound at a relatively low cost.
4,UPDATE 5/3/2017I've lived with this subwoofer pulling PC duty for quite some time. A while back I went ahead and added a dense amount of poly-fil to the interior of the subwoofer box and removed the inner port guard. This has substantially improved the subwoofer's lower frequency and eliminated the port chuffing. The general consensus is that adding poly-fil to a ported box does not help much. I had nothing to lose so I tried it out. I am now happy with this subwoofer and have upgraded the rating to 4-stars. Playing down to 25hz is now possible while retaining a smooth sound. I'm quite impressed given the price now.I recommend anyone with this subwoofer to add at least 20-ounces of poly-fil or fiber fill to the inside of the cabinet. Be sure it's a bit dense so you don't end up losing fibers out of the port. Just go down to your local hobby store whether it's a Joanne or something and buy a bag of fiber fill. You won't regret it.You also need to perform a "sub-crawl" with this and any other subwoofer you purchase. Every room will have different acoustics. The sub-crawl consists of placing the subwoofer where you'll normally be sitting and crawling around your desired placement spots to see where the bass sounds the best. When you find the spot the subwoofer should be placed in that spot. You'll also want to take advantage of port placement given this is a small subwoofer and room amplification can help it out quite a bit.Old Review-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bought this subwoofer as part of my budget PC setup which consists of a Denon S500BT and Micca MB42X/MB42X-C speakers.This subwoofer does handle lows relatively well as long as you don't expect too much out of it. 35hz is as low as it goes. Anything the subwoofer tries to reproduce that just isn't within its reach comes out as pure chuffing (port noise). Honestly I didn't expect it to perform phenomenally as it's an extremely cheap subwoofer.In music it does pretty well. It's responsive enough for most types of music. However anything that utilizes very low frequencies will make you cringe as the chuffing becomes apparent. (ie. Lara Croft Theme by Crystal Dynamics)In movies unless you've experienced the intended lows before you won't really know what you're missing. It is quite obvious that a lot of low frequencies are left unheard rendering this a subwoofer that I would not recommend for dedicated home theater systems unless you're on an extremely tight budget.The auto-on feature works well. There is no dedicated unfiltered LFE input at least one that's labeled anyway. The gain/volume control seems a bit jumpy turning a slight turn of the knob into a startling jump. The foam driver surround gives an air of cheapness. The port is cardboard with a blocking plate at the end which I assume is to prevent things/stuff/animals from ending up inside it. This creates some unfriendly turbulence though.With the Micca speakers I have it set at 100hz through my receiver. The speakers are set to small @ 80hz. Experimenting with 120hz/100hz.Overall for $100 I'm happy with this subwoofer. Not a fan of the chuffing but I'll survive as this is doing what it was intended to do... fill a vacancy for a cheap subwoofer.For comparison my dedicated home theater subwoofer is an SVS PC12-NSD capable of monstrously reproducing down to 15hz in my 16'x16' living room. Of course this Polk is not expected to perform even close to the SVS but I do know what audio content I'm missing with this sub.
5,I bought this sub after my Sony powered 100 watt quit working.  I have to say overall I am very impressed with the bass output in my surround system with this sub.  Polk is known for great audio components in my opinion.  I have a 5.1 surround.  I hooked it up to my Onkyo TX-SR353 receiver.  It Sounded awesome until I watched Arrival.  This was my test for bass output as the movie has some extreme bass sequences.  I set the low pass filter to 160hz. and the volume at just over half and between 3/4.  My receiver was set to crossover at 100hz after Mic test in the room.  In certain areas (if you have seen the movie you will know what I am talking about).  I experienced a little chuffing from the air port on the sub.  After some research and a little disappointment I learned that Polk has a "rat guard" on the interior of the sub.  It looks somewhat like a crosshair metal piece that is placed over the port to keep objects from entering the interior through the port as best I can guess.  After some hesitation and 3 hours of Youtube research I decided to remove the metal guard which was a bit of a pain due to enclosure.  This seemed to reduce if not eliminate the air chuffing through the port.  My receiver only has one sub out so I bought the amazon basics Y splitter 15 ft. cable (awesome cable BTW)  for $9.99. I connected to the L/R channels on the sub they made a considerable bass level and volume balance in my opinion over the single input to left channel  I was shown this exact sub at Best Buy about a year ago for around $200.  For $99.00 this sub is a steal.  It has some great deep bass. I can be in other rooms and feel the bass signal.  We are about eleven feet from the speakers in front and nine feet in the rear surround.  It has auto on/off depending on if it is receiving signal from a source.  This feature is nice but at low volume you may have to flip it to ON due to frequency range.  The cabinet looks nice with a wood grain composite I got mine in black although it came in cherry as well at one time. The shipper was mega fast came two days earlier than anticipated.  It weighs in at 26 pounds that was alot heavier than my previous sub.  The cloth grill with plastic grate fits nice and tight in the frame and comes packed with it in place.  Overall I would say if you are looking to upgrade your sub from a package surround system for a low cost this is your best bet.
5,Nice sound
5,Awesome bass for the priceHighly recommend
5,Excellent woofer for home entertainment...Excellent look and Craftsmanship
5,Arrived within 2 days of purchase but stinks that it’s in a Polk box not generic brown cardboard if you’re worried about “porch pirates”This subwoofer is a good inexpensive way to get some bass into your home theater. Is it the best? No but it’s also not 800$. It may not hit the super low lows <~30 Htz but it hits low enough to get some added bass to compliment my system.My Definitive Technology cs9060 center channel speaker has as integrated 8” subwoofer but it feels a bit weak to get “real” bass.  The psw10 is an inexpensive addition until the sound budget is available.If your receiver has a subwoofer out I would recommend using rca cable and  a y splitter to go into the sub. When I just connected a single rca to the left input it worked fine but it feels and sounds like I’m using more of the subs power with the y splitter. Maybe I’m wrong but the 8$ y connection was worth it if I’m right. I turned the phase all the way up and let my Denon receiver make the crossovers.  Speakers set small at ~80 Htz and Subwoofer set at ~120 Htz.My room is 12x15 and with the volume set at about 75% it is a noticeable improvement to my music and movies.One thing most people say in their poor reviews is that you get a “sound” from the unit itself. I did notice this myself when I had everything turned way up. After looking it up online and watching some videos you’ll see that this issue is a small metal piece that is located inside the box behind the front port. Had they added two bottom screws this probably wouldn’t occur but I think it must flap every now and then. I took off the amplifier in back (10 screws) and took the two screws that held the metal ring out with a stubby screwdriver. Screw the amp back in and viola no noise to complain about. That’s the only complaint I have about this inexpensive sub but that would be like comparing and complaining about a 98$ ikea tv console compared to an 800$ assembled wood one.
5,Why did I buy THIS particular subwoofer?a) Recently the power supply on my Logitech Z-5500 computer sound system died and after finding that (a) the cost of the repair was something like the nation budget of a small country and that (b) the "replacement" from Logitech was of a lower quality than the Z-5500 I decided to replace the system with a used receiver (  Yamaha RX-V373 5.1-Channel AV Receiver - (Discontinued by Manufacturer)        ) and reuse the 5 speakers replacing the dead subwoofer with this unit.b)The result is a system which is more flexible than the original Z-5500 and has a sound quality which is AT LEAST better than the Logitech's - and I expect this system to hold up for years.  Admittedly the room in which I'm using this is only 16'x22' and I can't comment on it's performance in a larger room.Now to discuss the product.Previous Polk experience: I've used Polk before and have NEVER had even a small problem with any of the units I've used and enjoyed.As people have commented in the reviews this subwoofer has amazing bass performance and the adjustable turnover point is a definite plus.  Also I absolutely love the standby switch which allows the unit to turn on automatically when the amplifier powers on and doesn't require that I either leave it on 24x7 or that I climb under a table to turn it on and off manually whenever I want to use it.Does it as good as the   Klipsch Reference R-115SW Subwoofer Black        ?  In a huge room probably not.  In the room I'm using it in it's close.  But the answer is no. Get real - it is significantly smaller than the Klipsch and doesn't cost $700+ either.  I needed a unit no larger than this one and having visited several audio departments and four high end audio stores to compare sound performance I think this is one of the best 10" powered subwoofers at anywhere near this price.  I realize that "best" without proper instrumentation and specific measurements is entirely subjective so YMMV on that one.  But for my purposes it sounds great and I also caught it on sale for $79 AND I'm EXTREMELY satisfied with it both sound- AND cost-wise.I was asked by a friend why I didn't get a unit that could handle 100 watts instead of 50.  As a physicist the answer is simple.  The volume level generated by a speaker using 100 watts may actually be lower than another using only 50 depending on the efficiencies of the two units.  That is for a given sound pressure level at the same distortion the power required by subwoofer A may be lower or higher than subwoofer B depending on the quality of the build and the electro-mechanical efficiency of the two units.  (otherwise it's simply a case of comparing oranges and apples)So would I recommend this subwoofer to friends and family?  Definitely and I'd buy it again - even if it weren't on sale
5,Replaced an expensive sub with this Polk sub. Very pleased with purchase. Many choices to wire up and sounds rich.
4,UPDATE 2022: In late 2021 I purchased Klipsch RP-8000F RP-500M and a Denon AVR-S960H together these are fine. This sub however still rumbles and seriously struggles with low frequencies. These lows cause the sub's case to rumble and rattle. I have to turn it off and let the towers handle it: perfectly. This sub was not intended for very low frequencies. It's just too weak but then again I never paid any attention to its specs - my fault as at the time I bought it I had a soundbar. That was 3 years ago; I'm moving onto a Klipsch subwoofer or another larger and more capable subwoofer that can handle deep low rumbles as it should. As it stands the Polk Audio PSW-10 cannot handle deep low bass frequencies and just rumbles through the case.UPDATE 2018: The   Yamaha NS-SW100BL 10in; 100W Powered Subwoofer  Black         was weak. I put both side by side and the   Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Powered Subwoofer (Single Black)         just performed better. I listened to music and movies and the   Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Powered Subwoofer (Single Black)         was just better. I was underwhelmed by the   Yamaha NS-SW100BL 10in; 100W Powered Subwoofer  Black        . These are NOT top of the line audiophile subs but for the   Yamaha YAS-107BL Sound Bar with Dual Built-In Subwoofers & Bluetooth Black         this was once I optimized the position and audio settings on the sub it was perfect. Now I just need background satellites.2018: I have a   Yamaha YAS-107BL Sound Bar with Dual Built-In Subwoofers & Bluetooth Black         so this may have been overkill. But I have the   Yamaha NS-SW100BL 10in; 100W Powered Subwoofer  Black         coming [soon] so it may just be the brand. But the bass sounds a bit distorted or warbly. We'll see if it's the PSW10; if the Yamaha sounds a bit too big then I'll return both and spring for the   Yamaha 100W Powered Subwoofer - Black (NS-SW050BL)         instead. But for now I am still testing out various levels...it doesn't sound that great but then again I don't have it in an ideal position. It was behind my TV at first. Yeah I know ...wrong. So when I get a longer speaker cable I'll place it on the opposite corner of the room. For now I have it on the side a few feet from the TV and I can hear the difference. It's a big sucker I'll see how it fairs with music. That's what I really want to see. Big movies and music. So far...meh...I like the bass but it's just warbly but then that may be the sounbdar. I had to set the Bass Extension OFF [on the soundbar] and lower the Subwoofer volume (this bar has an internal sub woofer).
4,Our living room is on the small size. A modestly sized home theater speaker system and 90wpc receiver provides the audio. The bass was augmented by a Polk Audio PSW111 Subwoofer from Amazon. This sub has an 8 inch woofer coupled to a 150wpc amp. It was purchased for its’ size rather than bass output. This sub provides OK bass and is easily hidden which pleased the aesthetics committee. The little Polk suddenly stopped working and its’ contribution was missed especially with movies. I looked to Amazon again and found that another Polk the PSW10 was #1 best seller in home audio subwoofers. The reviews for this sub were generally positive despite it having only a 50 watt amp coupled to a 10 inch woofer in a ported enclosure. I decided to give this Polk try.The PSW 10 is a fake wood box with basic controls and a removable grill. It is totally unremarkable. Although larger than my previous sub I was still able to conceal it between a chair and the main viewing wall with the woofer and port angled into the room. The PSW10 does not have a dedicated LFE input so I used a KabelDirekt (10 feet) 1 x RCA Male to 2 x RCA Male Subwoofer / Y - RCA / Digital Audio Cable - PRO Series cable to split the single LFE signal from the receiver to the L+R inputs on the sub. (a very nice cable BTW) The sub’s crossover was turned all the way up per the directions so the receiver would handle all the crossover duties. I used the test tone generator of the receiver and determined the sub needed to be set at just over half volume. A Best of Soundstage Blu-Ray was used for my initial evaluation. The sub was somewhat muddy and boomed at times. I decided to “burn it in” for a few days and the sound calmed down nicely blending better with my other speakers. I would not recommend the Polk PSW10 for critical music listening. It is best used in the AV environment when you have more senses working and can over look the Polk’s shortcomings.The first two movies we watched with the PSW10 were spooky new release titles on Blu-Ray with DTS Master Audio. Both films used low frequency information to embellish the spookiness and accentuate the gotchas. These disks would go from a whisper to a sound attack in a heartbeat. The PSW10 handled this without breaking a sweat. At a point in the fist film I heard a slight rattling and could not determine if it was in the sound track or not.  Upon investigation I found that the closet door off the living room was not tightly closed and the Polk was vibrating it. In the second film I discovered that the Polk was moving a candle warmer on an end table from a few feet away. I did not have the overall volume ridiculously loud and the PSW10 was set at just over a half. This thing puts out!As other reviewers have mentioned the Polk PSW10 can often be found for $99 making it an absolute steal. I paid $126 and am satisfied with the value I received. This sub is nothing to look at and does not carry enough power to arc weld with however for non-critical listening it is truly a bargain.
5,Sound is perfect for my room
5,I am not a big deal audiophile in both space and budget. I paired this subwoofer with a [2] Polk T15  speakers for front left and right and the Polk T30 center channel. I also added a pair of Goodwill minis for the back channels ($3 total) and now am living in the world of pretty decent 5.1 sound. I am sure that some will find issues but at the end of the day when I am watching TV or video streaming it sounds great and the volume is plenty impressive without blowing out the windows. This subwoofer is nicely built easy to install and has the volume controls etc right on the back where you can get to them. Do I wish it was wireless?- sure but I have other expensive hobbies to support as well and this does the job just fine.
5,Very good construction sound and price.
5,UP DATE AT BOTTOM. ordered the polk psw 1010 on a wedsney and receved it on a friday . im going to use it with the fluance 7.0 surrond system with the yamaha rxv671 recevier .sub is low cost  price wise . could drop inhertz down to 25 . but for the price and make . you cant really beat it.  quite a few years ago i had a yamaha rx 491 with paradigm atoms cc150 center and adp 10 sub with ads 100 dipole surrounds . for home theater and music . i still have the paradigme sub and sepreat crossover the polk comes close to low lows not quit as solid and wall and floor shakeing  . but once again its pretty inpressive for the price . ide recemend it to a friend and others to buy it its vertisatel and works from music to ht systems. if your on a buget its a good choice and it comes in a few different colors. not bad . mh. ill keep an up date. posted. UP DATE . its 5/10/13. sub still works great. like i said i have paradigm subs. this will not go down as low or play as loud . but/ this only has a 100 whatt rms amp 50 watts contiouns. my paradigms have 300 and 200. thats a big difference. i also have def tech 8040s with built in 300 watt subs . in each speakers  this is my main ht system . the polk is in our bed room with a yamaha rx-v 671 . and jamo speakers. alot of people dont take the tim to set up the speakers or sub . most just set it where they can plug it in and turn the knobs till they stop. not good. then say its muddy it clips it s not loud ect. all im saying is you have to spend a little time messing with it its a very decent sub for the price. theres subs out that cost more than this and sound terrable. i ran the yapo on the yamaha and set the speakers to larg to see . then changed them to small reran it and what a difference . it taks some time. no there not audiophile but for what they are and the price its a good buy. im pleased with it and would buy another one which im going to buy two more for my sons for there rooms . yes they have some port noise when pushed at higher volumes but the amp is 50 watts contiounus  100 is rms. i use it for ht and music and play it loud at times . it was designed for somuch and thats all. im pleased and would recamed this for someone on a budget or wants to keep cost down . i  bought it on a whim it was cheap and looked decent . its polk . so there you have it . good luck .
4,I bought this sub for bass fill in a small system in my redneck gym.  I wanted another set of speakers in an adjoining part of the gym the mains in another room are muddy when I'm next door. Two separate speaker systems on one amp YAY!.  I won't use it tons but like my music to be where I am.  Music without the ability to stir in serious bass is like eggs without the bacon it just doesn't work that well.Had some old old Clarion 970's in boxes that are super bright (will change them out one day) matched them up with this sub and voila .. fills the small area they are in with BIG sound.  The space is small so no need to really pump em' up.  Still enough that my significant other has concerns that I am forcing the neighbors to listen to music they might not appreciate.  The way I figure it is I have to listen to their dogs bark right?My first experience with anything "Polk"  It's perfect for my application.  This sub makes plenty of bass for the area it's in.  Had it a few weeks zero problems with it.  I use minimum 16 guage wire even lengths for left/right amp to the speakers and solder and heat shrink wrap all the connections.  No sub out on this amp so the amp speaker outs run to the sub and the sub outs to left right speakers.  Like Meghan Trainor said in her song ... "All About That Bass"My favorite for subs are Klipsch and I use those on mains have for a long while but this seems like a great economical solution for working spaces shops garage gyms and so forth.
5,Bass is really boring to me in general.  I don't get excited about subs the way I do about other audio stuff.  This subwoofer produces bass and it fills the room not sure what more you would want out of a sub.  For the price I am very happy but I would never spend much more just for bass.
4,I have bought two of these the second a few weeks after being so impressed with the first.The first I got to complement a couple of bookshelf speakers in the garage and it sounded so good that I got one for my home system as well.  The home system is not cheap -- a couple of larger B&W speakers and a couple hundred watt amp.  But holey moley was the difference noticeable with this subwoofer.  It made everything so much richer.I deducted a star because the spring clip nonsense they have for attaching speaker wires sucks.  Any larger cables have to be cut way down in diameter and I even had problems stuffing in 12 ga wire.  Also the controls to adjust the cutoff and volume are on the back of the speaker.  I get it: you are supposed to set them once but different music might want different settings.  Nowadays I want a Bluetooth interface and control from my phone (which is absurd). The interface could be better is all.Well I have purchased two of these so I must be a true fanboy.  Big wins for me on this unit are an adjustable low-pass filter and an auto-on amplifier.  For my garage with its tiny bookshelf speakers I set the filter high to get some of the low-midrange stuff my speakers would miss.  For my house the subwoofer cutoff is set lower as the speakers are bigger and better.  The auto-on means that I don't have to worry about turning it on and off.  I may not touch it for years.It is packed well in a box that clearly says what it is.  It comes with no cables.  I have set both of mine up as "Speaker B" rather than the more complicated wiring setups suggested by the manual.  This makes it easy to turn on and off and WOW it really makes a difference. It is a no-brainer at $100.I am astonished that a thing of such high quality can be delivered to my doorstep for so little.
5,I have an insanely old Sony 5.1 satellite speaker system and the subwoofer finally gave up the ghost which is a shame because I really liked the sound quality and the fact that the volume and power controls were on the front panel which seems to be a rarity these days. I did a lot of reading about budget subwoofers ($<300 is apparently budget for subwoofers)  and the PSW10 consistently got high praise. I'm somewhat limited in the height dimension for where I need it to go because of the door swings on some wall-mounted cabinets and this fit the bill. It's a stylish all black cabinet with a fabric grill on the front which makes this very unobtrusive. This one is front firing with a 10" driver which is a step up from the Sony's 8" and it feels like a much fuller and richer bass. The room it's in is approximately 15'x 10' and it is more than up to the task. The first movie we watched after setting it up was The Rise of Skywalker and the ambient rumble of the starships was present but not obvious or wall-shaking which is as it should be. I could really tell that it was working because both of my dogs suddenly poked their heads up and stared intently towards the screen. I won't bother going into the features as they are available in the description and the Polk website but I do like what it has to offer particularly in the inputs as it has L/R RCA inputs where some of the other budget SWs only accepted the speaker inputs without any of the other controls. I'm no audiophile but I do know good sound when I hear it and I think for a majority of people who don't have dedicated high-end home theater setups this will be quite adequate.
5,I put this on a covered patio 2 years ago. I bring it in in winter to help protect it but otherwise it sits outside (with a roof overhead) and works like a charm. Adds bass to my back patio and it very reasonably priced.
5,I have over the years slowly but surely built myself a fairly decent surround sound system for my small TV room.  Recently however I noticed that my subwoofer (an old Sony powered sub that came with a home theater in a box years ago) was starting to show it's age.  It wasn't sounding as good as it once had and as I upgraded to better components all around the sub had become the weak point of my system.Being budget minded I set about trying to find a replacement that wouldn't break the bank wouldn't overpower the rest of my system and would both look and sound good.The Polk PSW10 does both of these and does them well.When I first got the sub I set up the system with the sub in the same location.  I immediately felt a bit disappointed as the Polk didn't seem to sound as loud as the Sony had.  With my DVDs and music that I used to test the system it just didn't seem like it was hitting as hard as the old Sony had despite the fact that the Polk had much better specifications.It wasn't until my wife came into the room and asked why I had the bass so loud that I realized...the Polk WAS louder it just didn't seem as loud because it was cleaner and less distored.Once I had that out of the way I set about tweaking the system to match my speakers and I love the results that I ended up with.  For music I can adjust the level of the sub on my receiver and have it absolutely pound for music with heavy bass or I can adjust the level to a more flat and natural response for watching movies and TV.  These were things that didn't seem to make as dramatic of a difference with my old subwoofer and it's nice to be able to hit a few buttons on a remote and have the subwoofer's sound changed to match whatever it is that I'm currently listening to.I'm using the subwoofer with it's crossover basically canceled out as my receiver has a better crossover in it anyways.  I've found that the subwoofer seems to hit the low frequencies exactly as it should and it definitely provides good bass response.  Mated with some Sony SSB3000 bookshelf speakers for my front mains my sound range is incredible considering the cost of these two products.  The Polk sub does the frequencies that the Sonys don't very well and it complements the Sonys lower frequencies very well without overpowering the lower-midrange frequencies.Overall I can't say enough good things about this speaker.  It's transformed my surround sound setup and for a very good price has made a huge improvement!!!
5,I use this for my 5.1.4 surround sound system. I configured it how my surround sound said to the low pass all the way up and the volume at half. After my surround sound finished configuring it I had increase the subwoofer volume a few notches to make it sound right. For its size it has decent bass it's not wall shaking type of bass but decent for watching movies and listening to music. I am thinking about getting another one (maybe a 12" this time) to help the bass sound better and complete my 5.2.4 sound system. I don't use any of the speaker outputs from the subwoofer since my receiver handles that part. I use a splitter cable (https://amzn.to/3DS9h4n) to split my single subwoofer audio out to the Left and Right on this sub.I like the look of this sub especially without the cover on the front. The cover actually protects the front it has a nice looking mesh over plastic. I leave it on because I have kids and a dog and don't want the sub destroyed. I have had this sub over a year and still works as if it was brand new. Overall I recommend this sub if you aren't wanting a crazy ton of bass and just something to complete a surround sound setup.
5,I paired the speaker with bookshelf speakers for my TV using a 2 channel simple Yamaha receiver.  The sound is phenomenal.  I had been using a set of floor speakers and was concerned about bass response when I changed to smaller bookshelf speakers.  This subwoofer made all the difference.  In a 15' x 20' room the bass response is great in any location.  The bookshelf speakers paired with the Polk 10" gives an absolutely great range.  By far better for TV/movies than the floor speakers were.  Far superior to to sound bar with sub.  Super glad I went this route.
5,When it comes to subwoofers there is no "one size fits all". This being said I enthusiastically recommend the POLK PSW10 for its overall excellence in providing small to medium size rooms with the clean undistorted bottom-end that most full-range loudspeakers cannot possibly reproduce.I have home theater installations in three rooms of my home that vary in size power and performance expectations. For my high-end McIntosh Labs electronics I still swear by the small VELODYNE cube I purchased years ago. That installation features two rather large POLK MONITOR 70's. All the Velodyne has to do is reproduce the non-musical thuds of sundry spacecraft monsters and an occasional Death Star exploding. I should add that said Velodyne costs four time the price of the sub Polk being reviewed here.My finished basement system features 2 much smaller POLK MONITOR 30's and ENERGY Micro's for surround. I decided to give the POLK PSW10 a shot for this application. I cannot tell you how pleased I am with the performance of this relatively lightweight ported cube from Polk.With both music and home theater expectations in mind this compact and incredibly LIGHT cube fits the bill amazingly well. Godzilla rightfully churns ones guts various Motherships rattle the doors and 2001's (forgive me Mr. Strauss) Also Sprach Zarathustra shows off its much needed organ subtonics.IMAX special effects aside this is a surprisingly musical  little sub. Since my son entered The Juilliard School at Lincoln Center I've been privy to more orchestral masterpieces (as performed at Avery Fisher Hall) than I've heard prior in a lifetime of musical participation. I KNOW what an orchestra is supposed to sound like. The POLK PSW10 does not disappoint.I'm especially impressed with the tightness of the low bass. It handles special-effect sub-sonics remarkably well. Musically the bottom of a kettle drum is accurately reproduced along with the gut sounds that often are lacking in high-end "High Fidelity" systems costing a small fortune.I believe that a small room will not be overwhelmed if said room's electronics are carefully calibrated. I believe that the POLK PSW10 can service a "medium sized" (figure 12-18') room as well. The integrated amplifier in this cube should be able to handle a wide range of challenges but of course that is quite objective. (PS- experimentation is essential regarding placement and tweaking).For the price I stand by my "5-star" recommendation. To be blunt and rather pragmatic this lightweight cube would be a cinch to return to Amazon if it all disappoints. If you are being honest with yourself regarding your needs and expectations I don't think that you can go wrong here if price constants demand an "under $125" installation. If nothing else this POLK provides a perfect introduction to the world of ultra-high fidelity reproduction. Buy with confidence. Return if disappointed. It's that simple a decision!
5,I love music and love hearing/feeling every little thing in a movie/show im watching.Always used Polks in my cars.1st time having a Polk home suband im completely satisfied.Bass....Vibrates pictures off the wallsSet up...Quick and easyVolume...Neighbors down the road hate me.Looks...So sexi.(Black wood/gray)If you want sound and basshave to get Polk.Polk has alwats been around as a 1 of the "Top Brands" as far as speakers are concerned.Im sticking with them
5,Todo lo que e comprado con ustedes estoy muy Satisfecho y Agradecido  y seguiré  Ustedes Son Los Mejores. Gracias.
5,After Thanksgiving last year I purchased a set of Polk Audio RTi A1 bookshelf speakers to replace mid 1980's American Acoustics speakers.  The old speakers still produced good sound but I wanted to upgrade.  The result was a greatly better sound from the new speakers.  However because the AAL speakers contained a large woofer the new speakers did not deliver the low notes as previously.  This resulted in the decision to purchase a subwoofer.I wanted to stay with the Polk Audio line of speakers and decided to purchase the PSW 10 based on the  very affordable price and the many positive reviews.  Now I have much better bass response than with the AAL speakers and am more conscious of the bass sound.Several things will be mention as part of a learning process.  The instructions indicate that the speaker does not have a LEF input. Instead you are directed to use either the L or R Line input if you use a single subwoofer cable.  I found that the L input does not work only the R input.You have the option of selecting power to be on always or “auto” which turns the subwoofer on only when it receives a signal.  Initially I set it to auto but became concerned that the subwoofer was not working because the indicator light was on red (off) during some programs and music.  As a result I turned the switch to “on” which powered the  subwoofer at all times.  Later experiments revealed that the power switch was working correctly I just did not realize that there would not always be a signal to the subwoofer.  Not all programs or music contain notes low enough to trigger the subwoofer.  Once this was known. the switch was kept on auto and the bass notes are there whenever the program requires it.The subwoofer in not magnetically shielded.  With the speaker placed approximately ten inches horizontally from the TV there is some electrical interference.  This is only seen on a black screen as small “lightening strikes” in the corner of the TV nearest the speaker.  It does not seem to adversely affect either the sound or picture.  By moving the speaker further from the TV it can be eliminated.The volume range is quite adequate for my 18 by 25 foot room.  I am not interested in window shaking bass and have it set at a level to make you aware of the improved bass sound without overpowering the higher sounds.In general this is a very good low cost subwoofer.  I am not in the position to compare it to more expensive units but doubt there would be much to gain in quality of sound.
5,You truly could not need more than this subwoofer.  I have it in a large room with vaulted ceiling and it still fills it on 1/4 volume.  Seriously it rattles my windows so much that the fake mullions (new windows) and wooden venetian blinds buzz.  When I put my reciever at a slightly higher volume so that I can hear it in the living room (two rooms away) I actually can feel the bass in the floor.  All of that said it also sounds very balanced only rattling my windows during movies with LFE.  I have my receiver set up without any bass enhancement (though sometimes on the Rock EQ setting) and actually had to turn my LFE settings down a little because it was just getting out of control in action movies - I don't need to actually think there is a bomb exploding in my family room.I realize this will all be white noise for a product which so many have already reviewed similarly but I am writing the review to note a couple things that I had read about prior to buying this subwoofer.  First LFE's:  I have an ancient Dolby Digital reciever so perhaps this is not the norm anymore but mine has a setting for sending the LFE's directly to the speakers.  As such it is not a problem at all to get this subwoofer to play the LFE's and by using the crossover control to determine how much of those LFE's you want played by the sub vs. the rest of the speakers.  I can't remember for sure at this point but I think I have the cross-over set to around 100 Hz.  Second volume:  I know CNET stated that it has more than enough oomph despite the low listed power rating but I want to emphasize this once more.  Turned up past 50% volume this sub is simply more than you could sanely need.  I don't know what the other more expensive subs are giving you over this one because it is capable of overkill while still being plenty sensitive and melodic for the purposes of listening to music.  Finally I would like to note that it has an On Off and Auto power mode.  I hadn't noticed this mentioned in any of the formal reviews and would have liked to know that.  My old sub had only an auto mode and it annoyed me when it popped on and off during quiet scenes in movies.  That said this sub works flawlessly on auto if it is fed via the front satellite speaker wires - they are never going to be quiet during a movie so there's basically no possibility for the sub ever powering down except once it makes sense to do so.Get it.  Worst case scenario you can return it but you won't.
5,This is for a small space to fill out the "bottom" with some bookshelf speakers. For my purposes it's just what I needed. It does the job with ease.
5,I am not an audiophile and I am lucky if the family finds time to watch a movie every two weeks.  At some point in the last half of 2018 I noticed the sound for my Onkyo entertainment system was anemic at best.  But I always faced a mutiny wrt troubleshooting as there was a movie or gaming or something in play.  With the football play-offs I wrote a note to myself and checked on the system in those spare moments when it is not in use and everyone was up.  Turns out at some point the subwoofer died.  No power.  In researching I saw how-tos for replacing the resistor or other components and replacing the subwoofer for like was an easy e-bay purchase of probably more than the entire setup was worth.  I looked into repair and same deal - for the price of the repair I could buy a new soundbar system from costco that sounds great (or good enough for me) and would kill a slew of wires.  But then I had to come to terms with tossing a bunch of 7:1 pieces that worked with the exception of their stupid subwoofer. In additional googling I learned that Onkyo Subwoofers are junk (something I wish I had known ~7 yrs ago) and that Polk and Dayton are pretty good.  But I could not find one that had an LFE connection so I almost hit submit on an Acoustic Audio subwoofer.... which would probably have worked.  But at the last minute I shook off the confusion pressed upon my by sites and you-tubes showing how to solder a broken electronic to victory and bought a LFE to RCA adapter that theoretically would work for the polk.  Like I said I am not an audiophile.  When everything showed up my confidence was at 50-50.  I plugged in the woofer fired up a 5:1 trailer and BOOM!  Sounds great.  The depth that has been missing for at least 6 months is back.  Problem solved for way less that I was thinking I would pay.  The wife even came down to say she could feel the woof from upstairs.  Happy Customer.  Thank you Polk
5,We needed a replacement subwoofer after our receiver bit the dust after a lightning strike since the previous sub had no internal amp. After some research we decided on the Polk. Best decision ever. This thing is super! Hook up was beyond easy.Some people seem to be complaining about it not being great some claim it sounds "muddy" etc. However we haven't experienced these things and as long as you have your settings correct it's fantastic for movies music & games. Those complaining about the boominess or "muddy" sound likely do not have their equipment adjusted for the sub right or the knobs set properly on the sub for the room they have it set up in. We have a receiver with a single "sub out" jack and the Low-Pass knob on the back of the subwoofer all the way clockwise which creates an LFE input (since this sub doesn't have one). After a couple days of testing we found that the best place for the sub's volume knob was just below half. With that we've got GREAT bass all around for practically every situation whether we're watching movies playing games or even listening to music (which seems to be the primary gripe out there for this sub...don't listen to 'em) and it doesn't make the rest of the range sound murky. Dialog is crystal clear & higher frequencies are distinct. Just set it up according to the manual & then make minor adjustments until you find what works best for the room and you.One point of note that likely won't affect many people...We have a PS3 hooked up to the tv via HDMI  and the tv is outputting sound to our receiver with an optical cable. Games sound AWESOME on it with two exceptions...Rock Band & especially Guitar Hero. The output on those isn't tailor made for output in this fashion evidently & we find we have much fuller sound on those with a standard PlayStation output cable with the left & right audio RCA plugs going directly to the receiver. It sounds counter to everything one might have heard or understands about sound with this equipment but it works great for those two game series. We just have the PS3 set up to output audio to multiple sources & whenever we want to play Rock Band or Guitar Hero games switch the receiver over to that input and voila...fantastic full rich sound with plenty of bass while not drowning out the higher frequencies.All in all this is a wonderful subwoofer easily the best one I've had experience with in this price range. It won't break the bank and you'll LOVE it once you have it set up properly for your living room/den/entertainment room.HIGHLY recommended!!
5,Good bass quality easy install.
4,We purchased two Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofers for our new home to fill out the sound for two large rooms with in-wall or in-ceiling 7.1 speakers.  Size and shape were both top considerations as we wanted to integrate the subwoofer into a window seat in our great room so the unit had to be approximately 14" tall (precluding several other bigger more powerful choices).  Price was a secondary consideration -- but we do appreciate good sound and would have happily paid more for better sound if we could get the packaging right.As always with Amazon shipping was very efficient and the speakers arrived in good shape long before we were actually ready to install them in the new house.  Set up was no-brainer easy (as others have noted the lack of an LFE input is easily worked around by turning the crossover level of the speakers all the way up).  We routed a 20-foot RCA cable along the base of our hearth prior to installing hardwood flooring so the terminal end could be routed behind the drywall to the final installation spot tucked into the window seat in the very corner of the room.  Remember though that as a powered subwoofer you'll also need a close-by AC outlet.Now for the sound:  it's really good -- crisp not excessively boomy unless you turn the internal volume way up and surprisingly capable of churning out satisfying bass in a very large space.  Our primary listening environment is a large great room approximately 32 feet by 24 feet with a two-story cathedral ceiling.  The primary speakers are Audioplex 8" in-wall speakers driven by a Yamaha RX-663 receiver.  Most of our usage in this room is for "ambient" music during the day running in the receiver's 7-channel stereo mode -- and the Polk PSW10 admirably "fills out" the bottom end of the sound enriching it without being distracting or boomy.We also use this system for family movie nights in concert with a Samsung 52" A650 LCD monitor.  Once again the PSW10 does a fine job "filling out" the bottom end with solid bass even keeping up with the action-adventure movies my kids prefer.  As a minor beef I actually have had to get up and turn down the sub's volume during a couple movies because the level that works well with music is a little too much boom during loud action sequences... which I suppose says something about the sound levels this little speaker is capable of.Overall for the way we live (lots of music played at moderate volumes regular "home theater" sessions with the whole family on the couch) the Polk PSW10s have proven to be a great buy and a great value with satisfying performance in a right-sized package.  A true audiophile might be disappointed but for real-world moderate-volume usage these are great little speakers for a great price.
5,Combined this with the Edifier R1280DBs Active Bluetooth Bookshelf Speakers. This combination work very well for me. I listen to anything from classical to various metal. Nice bass from this subwoofer. I had to do some adjustments to get what the amount of bass that I wanted. With a little patience it is setup exactly the way I wanted. Would highly recommend to anyone that wants a nice bass but not extreme bass. The included 3.5mm to RCA cable is only about 6 feet so if hooking up to speakers like the Edifiers would recommend buying a longer cable. I purchased a 15 foot cable since the Edifiers are mounted on the wall and the subwoofer is sitting off to one side of the room. Would highly recommend since this fulfilled everything that I wanted.
5,I would strongly suggest this subwoofer to anybody that is currently considering an entry level sound system. If you are only wanting to invest a few hundred dollars in your home theater experience and would like to develop your system slowly then this is the sub for you. I had this sub in an apartment and it was a bit too loud at times. However I doubt a subwoofer that's quiet enough for an apartment really exists.With that said I did love this sub and only recently decided to upgrade after 4 years of owning it without any problems at all. I did not upgrade because the sub wasn't functioning properly but because I had experienced how great getting this sub was and had started to realize it's limitations (35-40 hrtz is pretty high for a sub and it gets some port noise once you get to this frequency range). This subwoofer is great for music and is a bit less.. detailed.. for the home theater. You get a lot of oomph and just enough detail to whet your appetite and give you a baseline for when the upgrade bug bites. As I said earlier if you are new to the home theater experience and don't want to invest a lot then this is the sub for you. If you have a lot of experience with home theater equipment you will be impressed by the output on this little guy for $100 but you won't be blown away by the level of detail.If after a few years you decide to upgrade from this subwoofer I would strongly recommend the BIC PL-200. I am amazed by the level of clarity that this upgrade provides for the price range (about $300). However due to the level of detail you may not enjoy a higher end subwoofer until you have spent hours playing with your sound levels to match the rest of the sound system. I was not immediately impressed by my upgrade and it took two days and a full movie of playing with sound settings to get it just right. You won't find a worthwhile upgrade from this PSW10 until you get to the $300 range. If nothing else that should definitely let you know how good this subwoofer is. There are better ones for twice the price but I've dug through a ton of forums and researched a lot of upgrade options (I originally only wanted to spend $200 on my upgrade) but there were very few people or articles that recommended that price jump from the PSW10 due to the marginal return you will get at twice the value.
5,At this price point this thing is a beast. Direct connect or passthrough options volume power and phase controls- you really cant ask for more. Sounds great. The cabinet was larger than I expected but for my high surround rear speakers it does the trick.
5,I wired a small 11x12' room for in-wall 5 speaker surround. The 8" 3-way main speakers and 6" 2-way center and rear surround all aound great but lack low end even with bass turned up.This affordable subwoofer is a bit large but fit nicely under the built-in desk i have in a small closet. The closet is in the right-rear position relative to the screen. There is no door and i have it sitting diagonally in the corner projecting at roughly a 45° angle to the screen. You really couldn't tell where the subwoofer was located. The bass seemed to surround me as if coming from the other speakers which i knew wasn't the case. It truly exceeded my expectations.The bass seems crisp with different genres of music and gleefully shook my 4yo sons bones watching bumblebee. It's plenty loud and fit our purpose for small home theater.I honestly don't know what people are complaining about. I suspect user error. It's hooked up to pre out 1 & 2 on my denon receiver. It didn't work at all until i ran auto setup again. After that it was spot on as far as the kind of house-rattling theater sub i was looking for. It kicks ass especially at this price point.The room has hardwood floors a vaulted ceiling pitched up on the side with the tv knockdown ceiling texture orange peel wall texture a built-in drywalled shelf above the tv and glass french doors on one side. For my setup it was just right. Your milage may vary. maybe if you had carpet or your acoustics were significantly different it would leave something to be desired.
4,Sound is good for a 10in sub. I was disappointed with the fact there is no LFE connection (low-frequency effects) meaning you will need a 2 to 1 RCA cable adapter to use with your receiver if it has a single output.
5,This is my second of these that I purchased to complete my 7.2 system. Man oh man I didn't realize adding a second subwoofer made that kind of difference. Boom da da BOOM! These are in a room that is 20'x23' and the pair are more than adequate.What I was expecting was maybe 50% additional bass (subjectively) from the second subwoofer and what I got (there again subjectively) was about four times the bass. Blown away! Pun intended. Couldn't be happier and these are very nice subwoofers for the price. Not audiophile but then again I could care less about bragging on overspending for maybe 5% better quality to my ears.
5,I wanted to put together a decent sound system on a budget so I bought a cheap SHERWOOD receiver 2 small BIC bookshelf speakers and this baby for $300 total delivered from AMAZON.  Having spend over $1500 on my main sound system I was expecting a much smaller sound but what a surprise.  Even at half volume this SUB blows away the more expensive 12" SUB in my main system.  Even more amazing becausein this system I used $60 BIC speakers (for the PAIR) vs. $700 BOSE speakers in the main unit.  And more amazing still this $300 system is located in my basement which has a cement floor and cinder block walls - not the best acoustically speaking.  My room is 15X15 and built like a bunker and this baby rocks the whole room at half volume.  Truly AMAZING.  It has a few flaws I must admit:1) It lacks a direct SUBWOOFER input jack - you can work around this by hooking the amps SUBOUT To the L channel of the LR stereo input but it shouldn't be that way.2) You cannot remove the power cord from the unit - I find this feature helpful because I like to keep my components unplugged when not in use and it is easier to get at the back of the speaker than it is to get at the plug in the wall.  It also helps when you are moving it around to be able to remove the cord.  Definitely a shortcoming.3) The electric cord could be a bit longer.4) A remote control for the volume would be nice.5) You have to unplug it to keep it from drawing any juice when idle.This dumb red LED stays lit all the time even when it is off if you leave it plugged in.BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE:1)Tons of bang for the buck - as i said for $99 it outperforms the BIC I paid $180 for.2) Tons of bang for the space - it is a nice size - smaller than the 12" BIC yet bigger sound on fewer watts.3) It is attractive - nice cabinet nice grill.All in all a definite 5 star item especially under a hundred bucks delivered.If you want to shake the earth this baby will get the job done.  Just keep it away from any fragile items that might vibrate off of shelves or walls.Added bonus: are you losing a noise war with a neighbor who owns a motorcycle?  This baby will even the score.
5,I use this outside on a covered deck. It is in conjunction with 6 small speakers that are mounted inside the cover's perimeter. The sound is more awesome than I expected!
5,I got this as a supplement for the stereo system in my garage. However after setting it up I was so impressed with the bass signature that I decided to use it to replace the subwoofer in my home. For my use a 10" sub is the perfect size and this offers great sound and features for the price.
5,The bass was too intense and I had to block off the port once that was done the response was much smoother in my room. It has plenty of boom if you want it. I am delighted with the sound and the purchase.
5,Home entertainment surround sound great base I would buy it again
4,So I spent over 3 hours cycling through my favorite tunes on my Android phone from the 500 plus songs in my library. First of all I bought this for my motorhome because I've got an older but very good quality boombox set up in there for my tunes. The boombox was just lacking in bass and most of the lower frequencies. My first impression when I got this out of the box was that this is a large subwoofer and probably too large for my RV. However I did want to hear it so I hooked it up to the Bluetooth receiver splitting the signal between the boombox and subwoofer. I spent an hour or so finally tuning the subwoofer to match the boombox. This is a pretty good sounding subwoofer for th money. I'm most likely going to swap  this subwoofer for an older and smaller Infitinity subwoofer hooked up to the home stereo. It was so nice last night being able to hear the lower organ notes in the "Te Deum" from Puccini's Tosca. This is why I got the subwoofer.Update 2015-05-04. This weekend I took  the subwoofer home since it was two big for my RV. It replaced a 17 year old Infinity 10" down-firing sub which has been working very faithfully for all these years. It's coming to the RV. Well at home I have a pair of 13 year old JBL 2-way speakers PS 40s I believe which are one of the best pair of bookshelf speakers I have ever owned. These are now paired with the Polk and my oh my can I hear those lows from Pink Floyd's "Welcome to the Machine" and other Pink Floyd tunes like the heartbeat opening to "Breath" from Dark Side of the Moon. Another great test is "Bluchanga" from Mongorama which has a jazzy Latin beat with great bass drums and a fantastic saxaphone piece. I also played "Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1" by Elgar with the bass drums coming through quite nicely. Definitely very pleased with my purchase and this is not my first Polk. I've owned many Polk speakers before including an LF14 from 30+ years ago which was the original Polk sub woofer. Also have a pair of Polk mini bookshelf speakers in the "man-cave". You really can't go wrong with Polk speakers:)Update 2015-06-30. Listening to my favorite tunes including "Waltz of the Flowers" Eminem's "Without Me" and various standards and jazz pieces. While listening I though I'd take a picture of the sub in our living room which is open into the dining room and kitchen with 12 foot cathedral cielings. Sub is chugging along with great bass output.
5,After 12 years our definitive technology ProSub800 finally died on us so I bought the Polk Audio PSW10 which happened to be on sale.  First of all I couldn't believe how big the box was it came in. I figured 10" subwoofer was 10" but this is twice that size all around.  Bigger than I thought and REALLY powerful sound.We use this in association with our Mitsubishi big screen tv which has an integrated Unison sound system..together it sounds amazing.  I swear I only have the Polk PSW10 set at 2 or 3 and it's more than enough.  Really really powerful subwoofer. I can only imagine how amazing this would sound with a stereo system.  Great product at a great price..highly recommend
5,Initially I was under impressed upon hooking up the PSW10 it sounded muddy and thin like some of the critical reviews mentioned.  I just wasn't getting what I was expecting out of this sub I even kept the box in the living room for a few days just in case I wanted to return it.  Maybe I was being too critical comparing it to my 10+ year old Def Tech Prosub 100 which is rated down to 19 hz.  But how could I compare a $99 sub to a $450 sub (at the time).  I put it through it's paces testing all the sub tests on youtube for several hours (not a scientific test with an omnimic).  I thought I'd test out the frequency range first rated 35 - 200 hz to my amazement I could hear the sub almost down to 30 hz but then it just dropped off entirely below 30 hz not great for a sub but better than it's rated for and keep in mind it was $99 shipped to my door.  I then proceeded to play all of the youtube bass test songs dub-step hip hop basically nothing I listen to.  During this testing I played around with the gain and frequency controls with the gain at about half and the frequency about 2/3 I was amazed I was getting hard hitting clean sounding bass that was rattling my windows and walls in my house I let this go on for about 3 hrs and maybe it excersized and broke in the sub a little.  After that I tested out movies and TV shows with Dolby Digital and I was impressed.  With the gain turned a hair past half movies had the thunderous floor shaking bass and music sounded clean and tight with bass that I could hear and feel throughout my entire house.  By no means does it compare to my main theater system comprised of a Denon AVR-X2100W Def Tech speakers bi-polar fronts and surrounds and DT 10" sub but then the system it's running on was only a fraction of the cost.  I'm currently running the Polk PSW10 through a Yamaha receiver with Paradigm 5SE's up front and MB Quart surrounds it's my secondary budget system and the PSW10 has definitely accomplished filling out the bottom line.  I'm glad I gave this sub a chance after the initial break-in and some fine tuning I'm very satisfied and it's a great buy for what you get.
4,It thumps impressively but not "better" - and certainly with less... control... than does a pair of EPI 320s from the 1980s.Which of course are the standard of solid controlled bass response regardless of volume.That said this subwoofer is relatively discrete and adds a good depth of sound and vibration to low-key family room movie viewing.And as previously mentioned it is much loved by the teenage boys in the house.  Whose use of it to vibrate the place was unanticipated.
4,I bought Polk bookshelf speakers and was looking for a sub to go along with them and came upon the PSW10. I did a lot of research reading reviews on this sub and other subs in and around the price range. Most people said that it was good so I felt comfortable buying it for about $100.I like to think that I have a good ear. I've grown up loving music and my dad has always been in bands so I got my taste from him. I guess I should have known what I was going to get spending just $100 but I was pumped to see what this thing could do. I thought it'd sound great. It's pretty good and if you aren't too concerned with perfect quality it's a great choice. The only thing is that it just can't handle the low lows. It flutters and sounds terrible but most music doesn't have these frequencies anyway. Rap and hip-hop might be an area of concern but anything else should be in the clear. Another thing is if you want it to be VERY loud it isn't going to sound good. It gets very muddy and you can hear the sub fluttering when you crank it but again this isn't a huge concern. It handles reasonable volumes just fine.There was one thing I was confused about when I was reading the reviews so let me clarify for anyone with the same problem. YOU DO NEED A RECEIVER. I thought because it was powered and the pictures showed speaker outputs I could power the speakers with the sub. I was wrong... The power only goes to the sub. It is not put out through the speaker outputs. They are just there if you want to wire the system in another way. Luckily I had an old Onkyo receiver laying around.So as long as you aren't looking for anything amazing this sub is a pretty good choice because of the fact that it is so cheap. I wanted to have something better but I'm in college so I couldn't afford it. If you have a higher budget go for something that handles a lower frequency range. The audible frequency range is from about 20-20000Hz. This sub is said to be able to handle down to 35Hz but I don't think it sounds good even there. I'd go for something that is rated down to at least 30Hz or 25Hz.Hope this helps
4,I purchased a Polk Audio PSW10 10" Powered Subwoofer to complement the Elac Debut 2.0 B6.2 speaker.I mainly listen to classic music on FM radio.Therefore very strong bass is not required.So far I have adjusted the 100Hz sound to be heard through the subwoofer.The subwoofer seems to sound fine.Now I don't find any significant difference with using the subwoofer as the overall sound is better than before.
5,LOVE IT
2,PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BUYING THIS SPEAKERMy friend and I both have this speaker in two totally different setups. But we both had the same problem. And so do apparently more than a few owners of this subwoofer who have posted about it online. The problem is - PORT NOISE.Especially if you are fond of music with some deep booming basslines you'll notice that if you play such a song and turn the volume up beyond 50% you get a significant amount of port noise. Like a LOT. Basically it means that you bought a nice new heavy subwoofer and you can't use it past 50%.(If you already have the speaker and want to see what I mean by this turn up the bass to like 70% and play "Free Smoke" by Drake and wait for the bassline to kick in at around 42s. Or if you're more scientific play tones at different low frequencies (e.g. 40-80Hz) and you can hear it that way too).So just know this fact going in. If you aren't a bass-heavy person and just want a sub to round out your 5.1 setup so that the sound is a bit fuller when watching the 10000 explosions in Transformers 27 then perhaps you won't be affected by this. But then again I'd ask you why you were buying a $90 subwoofer in the first place - because that role could be played by a cheap Logitech computer sub on clearance at Best Buy. And if you DO care about bass then spend a few extra bucks for a speaker that won't need mods out of the box just to be "okay".MODS FOR PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THIS SPEAKER AND HAVE REMORSENow if you aren't the kind of person who wants to mod a speaker yourself (there's always some risks - you might mess something up you might get shocked by a capacitor you might void your warranty you might irreversibly change your speaker by trusting the words of an internet stranger) then stop reading this review now. Consider this a disclaimer. I'm not a speaker expert but my mom thinks I'm pretty smart so I've got that going for me.I did a bunch of searching around online and I found 3 oft-repeated tips to improve this speaker.1. Remove the Rat Guard - There's a small metal grill at the back of the port (the hole where the sub "breathes" from) inside the subwoofer that can rattle. First power off the subwoofer and unplug it from everything. Leave it unpowered for like 15-20 minutes to make sure the capacitors are discharged (the red/green light on the back of the sub should turn off). Unscrew the back carefully (don't touch any of the circuitry) and then unscrew the rat guard. (There's a nice Youtube tutorial on how to do this if you search for "Polk PSW10 Port Noise").2. Put a Sock or Towel in the Port - This prevents the port from shaking crazily and causing some cringe-inducing sounds when playing at high volume. However this will also likely muffle some of the super-low end frequencies as well. Thankfully this step is super reversible (take the towel out of the hole) if you don't like it. For me personally this step helped a lot. I can pump the sub to like 75% volume (you don't really need to pump it any higher... this sub packs quite a punch even at 75%) and have it not sound like a frenzied woodpecker got caught inside the box.3. Buy an RCA Y-Adapter - Not quite sure whether this one is necessary but it seemed to come up a bunch as a suggestion.FINAL REVIEWSo here are my final thoughts. After mods this Subwoofer goes from bad to okay. For some people maybe even decent. But this isn't a top quality subwoofer. There are subwoofers that can reach lower frequencies and higher volumes without spazzing. At the end of the day this review is more for people who already have this subwoofer and need to make the best of what they have.To be quite honest this is an example of BAD DESIGN. I shouldn't buy a new subwoofer and find that I can't turn the volume knob past 50%. I also shouldn't buy a subwoofer and be expected to manually modify it to get it to work properly.If you're not a super bass-heavy person then just buy any decent-wattage subwoofer from Craigslist and call it a day. No need to spend $90 on this. And if you care about bass then pay a little bit extra and get something like the Dayton Audio SUB-1000 or the SUB-1200 (my friend who owned this Polk speaker upgraded to a Dayton and loves it. It sounds incredible).I'm gonna add some tags to the end of this review so that it pops up when people search for stuff:port noise rattle rat guard sock towel y-adapter modification mod fix AvatarTheLastAirbenderIsAnUnderratedGem issue troubleshoot problem bass high volume grill shaking polk dayton
5,I was a "hard-core" audiophile from around 1979 to 1990 and one of the top brands in that time was Polk Audio. I don't know how long before then that Polk Audio was established but they certainly got the high fidelity world's attention as far back as that.I don’t have the kind of powerful system I had back in my ‘audiophile days’ anymore (I couldn’t afford it now). However I have begun rebuilding a modest system with very good condition vintage components to include a Sansui 150w p/Ch. integrated amp ADC SS Two MK II EQ Tascam and Akai R to R decks and Philips Turntables.Prior to adding the Polk Audio PSW-10 to my system I would 'push' the low octaves of the music through my speakers using a high-quality graphic EQ. The problem was the speakers couldn't reach the deep bass end and I would crush the mid-range capabilities in the attempt. I simply couldn’t get the ‘full-body’ sound I was after.It certainly wasn’t due to a speaker deficiency. In fact my system’s speakers are Klipsch but even so they weren't designed for the lowest range of the sound spectrum.The Polk Audio PSW-10 sub-woofer was exactly what I needed to reach that ‘sense of presence’ in the music from my turntables and reel-to-reel decks. I did expect a degree of improvement in the sound of the music but it went far beyond my expectations. The bass wasn’t ‘boomy’ and as a former drummer I could actually ‘see’ the kick pedal with each strike in the song as I listened.I wanted a sub-woofer powerful enough to bring in the low octaves yet affordable and within the range of my budget. The Polk Audio PSW-10 met all the prerequisites and exceeded my hopes in its performance. To date it’s definitely one of the most important and significant upgrades to my system.This single PSW-10 Sub-woofer has added a significant dimension to my entire system and in a way that no other component could have done. Be it Classical Jazz country Rock Hip-hop etc. the sub-woofer is a component that should be considered an absolute ‘must-have’ regardless of your music preferences. The Polk Audio PSW-10 will fill that requirement beautifully and without emptying your wallet! Rich
3,Too much punch and not enough deep bass. Volume must be maxed out to get something out of it -  Suitable for only small applications. Better off going with a Klipsch 12” - sounds night and day better.
5,Just received it 2 days ago. My original sub woofer came w/ a set from Polk. Did not even notice it was not working until 2 weeks ago & that was due to having some painting done & was over in that corner. It may have been not working for years. The set was purchased in 2000. Called Polk about a small speaker that I broke the threaded part in the back used to mount. Also asked them about what could have gone wrong w/ the sub. Was toldit could be anything from a fuse to the printed circuited board. Open my old one & pulled the fuse out put could not tell if it was bad until I found my fuse checker in my car. Bought a pack of 5 from Radio Shack & came home. Soon as I put one fuse in & turned it on the fuse blew. Tried 3 more fuses & all blew. Dan @ Polk told me about this PWS10-10 @ Amazon & that it would make a good substitute. So for $99.00 I figured it would be good enough for my use mainly alot of TV watching very little music. Hood it up turned it on & the bass was nice. I have it about 1/2 way up in volume used a RCA plug from back of my Sony to one of the inputs on the back & used a Y connection like I had on the old one to plug into both Left & Right inputs. I don't know what to do w/ the other controls yet because my 2 rear speakers are disconnected due to painting that wall & have not put thm back up yet. That is the best I can say at present time. I can tell when the bass does come on & plan on leaving the on control on @ all times unless I'm not going to be in my house for a period of time.Only thing I do no like is the very small feet it sits on. It is on carpet right now but soon it will be on Bamboo flooring. I unscrewed the other legs from old unit & will put these on to raise the unit up about 2-3".Not being an audiophile I think that this is going to be just what I need & for $99.00 you can not beat it.
4,I got this sub back in 2010.  Since that time it's been attached to 3 different soundbars and watched hundreds of movies and thousands of songs.  Absolutely love this sub.  It can handle anything I throw at it.Problem I have is with pricing.  I bought this for around $90 over 10 years ago.  It's now going for $145.  What's up with that Polk Audio/ Amazon???As much as I love this sub I had take off one star for the recent price gouging.
4,I really like the bass and volume control on this subwoofer. It is perfect for the finishing touches on my surround sound system.
5,Setup:  Kinter K2020A+ Tripath  Pioneer SP-BS22-LR  Polk Audio PSW10I am not an audio pro just a guy that wants to listen to some tunes while working from home. The Kinter amp is connected to my macbook and pumps out some pretty good sound to the Pioneers but lacks the lows I wanted. I added the Polk PSW10 and for the price it is great. I am in something like a 12x14 spare room/office and this sub might be more than I needed.If you want to listen to rock/alternative/metal and have the space this works well.
4,For $99 this sub really cannot be beaten.  That said this sub performs pretty decently when listening to music on a 2.1 setup paired with a decent receiver and some nice bookshelf (or small towers).  Push it hard or listen to something really bassy it suffers. For a home theater this sub just can't hang  it just can't seem to push the low rumble a movie soundtrack provides without noise.  After 6 months of listening to the PSW10 I would cringe when something low hits horrible amounts of flappy noise (chuffing) coming from the port.  Almost as though something was stuck inside.  Peering inside the port I saw a small "+" bracket at the back of the port.  It's also only mounted on one edge and was easily moved by my finger.  I removed the back plate from the Subwoofer and then removed the "+" bracket(2x Phillips #2).  I reseated the amplifier plate and secured all 10 screws.  Turned on my Dolby Atmos test track and was AMAZED at how much better this little guy sounds.  It's fantastic to feel the punch not hear the air moving.  Using a tone generator I tested both before and after modification at 25 30 35 40 50 & 60Hz.  It was a phenomenal improvement.  This is a 3-star sub before the mod 4-star after.If you're looking for a small budget sub for a starter system or small space this can do the trick.  This sub unfortunately left me wanting more after 6 months.  I run a 7.2 Yamaha TSR-7810 with a Polk TSI speaker setup (TSI200x2 CS10 TSI100x2 & Pioneer AJ Atmos Speakers)  I couldn't be happier with my setup EXCEPT for this sub.  It's better now but will be replaced as soon as I can find what I'm looking for.  Maybe a PSW505 from Polk but I'm open to some other brands as well.
5,its great :)
4,Item size was ideal for the space couldn’t deal that when volume was raised to a high level it sounded distorted choose to go with a 12 inch sub instead which did not have this issue.
4,CNET said:Subwoofers look pretty much the same. Some are big and some are small but most are cubes or boxes of some sort. Catch is they don't all sound the same. We've heard our share of boomy muddy-sounding subs and while they sometimes click with home theater the boomier models fall to pieces when they attempt to reproduce the nuanced sound of a stand-up bass. That's why we were so jazzed about Polk's most affordable sub the $199 PSW10: it pounds out home-theater thrills and musical bass with equal prowess.The PSW10 has a 10-inch composite woofer and a 50-watt high-current amplifier. Yes we know that some of you are probably snickering over the skimpy power rating but we'd urge an audition before you dismiss this sub. We found its bass power definitely up to snuff. For connectivity you get stereo speaker-level inputs and outputs as well as RCA line-level inputs. All that's missing is a direct/LFE input that bypasses the onboard 80Hz-to-160Hz crossover control. We prefer direct inputs because they make it easier to blend the sound of satellites and the subwoofer but we didn't have any problems matching the PSW10 with Polk's Monitor 30 satellite speakers.This is a fairly compact subwoofer just 14.5 inches high 14 inches wide and 15 inches deep; thanks mostly to its robustly constructed MDF (medium-density fiberboard) cabinet it weighs a hefty 26 pounds. The PSW10 is available in black or cherry-colored vinyl and its titanium-finish front baffle matches that of the other Monitor Series speakers. The extended warranty offers five years of protection on the woofer and three years on the electronics--pretty decent considering that the electronics warranty on many other products is often limited to just 12 months.The PSW10's deep-bass capabilities were impressive but its definition and control on the Blue Man Group's new DVD-Audio disc The Complex were really special. The Blue Men's drums and percussion-heavy instrumentals lose impact on muddy-sounding subs. But the PSW10 delivered every thump and rumble with the utmost clarity. That said it will do its best work in small to moderate-size rooms. If you want to feel the bass in larger spaces check out the PSW10's bigger sibling the PSW12.Sothere are alot of people who say "no tight enough"yet CNET said it was a decent Sub woofer for the money!.
5,I bought this same Polk subwoofer in 2012.  The original unit still works perfectly in a 2.1 system (B&W 607 + Polk SW).  Excellent bass quality.  Requires level adjustment to tune bass output to eliminate boom (to be expected).  The new unit is part of a 5.1 system (Polk speakers + Polk SW) for video games.  Works great for the gaming system.
5,I have this in a large sized bedroom and use it for both movies and music and I must say it sounds amazing!I have installed some beefy subwoofer setups before and I must say this thing is powerful. You'd think that for being so cheap you would be loosing out on quality but this thing will surprise you. I'm extremely picky when it comes to sound. I can tell good subwoofers from the poor quality crackly ones.For starters this thing makes my entire room shake. Whether it be music or a movie. With music any genre sounds amazing with this. Any heavy bass songs will definitely give a deep low boom sound.I noticed other reviewers say that this thing might not be for the movie watchers but I strongly disagree. During movies this thing tackles everything. Explosions no problem. Long helicopter scenes no loss of bass over time. Me and my girlfriend are going through all the Harry Potter movies right now and during the climactic scenes they like to shove a lot of long drawn out bassy rumbles. This subwoofer never loses power never crackles never sounds fuzzy. It remains deep and true throughout the whole thing.I usually don't go higher than half this things capacity and I'll sometimes get complaints from people on the other side of our house (and we don't have a modern day hollowed out plastic house. We have an old solid thick wall house). If I have music playing loud and I leave the room (door close) and go downstairs it reminds me of when a car drives by your house that has extremely loud subwoofers blasting. If I do the same while a movie is playing it reminds me of standing right outside of a movie theater room.Down the road I plan on setting up a small movie theater set up in the living room and I think I'll get another one of these to have on each side of the room.Definitely good for watching movies despite what other people have said. And before I got this I had completely spoiled ears from having extremely powerful stereo setups (I am one of those people that can drive by your house and vibrate your china cabinet with my car's subwoofers that I had mentioned earlier).
4,I had to replace my PS12. I found this 10" at a good price and decided to try it. My old unit only had one cable for the Sub Woofer out. When I set this up I used just one cable from the receiver to the Woofer. It did not sound good at all. I hoped that it was because I only had one side plugged in. When the "Y" 2 into one arrived I was relieved that my initial disappointment was unjustified.  The humming went away and the sound quality improved greatly.  While it didn't give the same bass as the 12' it is still very good. So buy a 2 into 1 cable with the Sub Woofer and avoid an initial problem. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with product. I'm giving it a 4 star rating  not because of any defect or quality issue. It's because I am comparing it to my 12" which had some more oompf to it.
4,INITIAL IMPRESSIONS: I spent many hours reading reviews before settling on this Polk 10" sub. I have a small listening space: 12' x 20' so I did not need tremendous power. I paired this with a Lynn Majik 30 watt/channel integrated amplifier and B&W CDM1 speakers with music fed in via a Dragonfly DAC plugged into an old Mac iBook holding roughly 900 CDs worth of AIFF tunes.The music benefited significantly from the addition of the sub Run at such a low power the sub seems to handle the bass efficiently (for its price) freeing the speakers to handle the mid- and upper-range signal. Because the sub is powered the Lynn has extra power for the CDM1s and I have more overall volume as a result. My afternoon (Sunday morning delivery!) was spent listening to bass-centric tunes such as Deep Purple's "Smoke on the Water" Adam Ben Ezra's "Flamenco" Devo's "Mongoloid" Pretender's "Mystery Achievement" and Dave Brubeck's "Take Five". None sounded boomy or muddy.SETUP was pretty straightforward requiring me to snip some ends off existing cables to get at bare wire. For my needs the sub volume is set to around 1/3 power with the low-pass set at around 2/3. Power is in Auto so it will power itself down when inactive. In addition to music needs this will be providing bass for DVDs (via a really cheap player) or video streamed from an Amazon FireTV box. Signal out of the television also runs through a DAC into the Lynn.I expect there will follow a week of tweaking the settings and placement as well as a breaking in of the sub. I will likely update this review in a few weeks. In the short run I am glad I bought this sub.UPDATE: It's been about two weeks since I installed this sub. Nothing huge to report. It's working well. I have still been adjusting the low-pass filter to see where I want it. I have marked two places on the volume knob; a higher-volume one for low listening volumes (sort of like having a "Loudness" button and a lower one for higher listening volumes. This might not be needed if one was using a Line input. Used this way the bottom doesn't get lost at low listening volumes nor get too pronounced at higher listening volumes. No troubles to report. Still a good purchase.
5,Very accurate reproduction of sound. Bass is solid but not boomy. I was skeptical but it had SO MANY good reviews I just thought it was a good bet. Glad I did too. This is a very good sub. I notice a world of difference from my old HTIB sub. I have mine set at %50. It does not OVER power my nice home theater set up. I have good ceiling speakers and they are complimented with this sub. Lows are solid. They literally go right through you. When I am in the room above this I can feel the bass too but through the rest of the house it is moderate at best. If I turn it up it gets really loud. I could see my close neighbors (55 yards away) calling to see what was going on. But I don't need to be battered by that much sound. I use it mostly for movies and TV but this thing is wonderful with my CDs. Huey Lewis and the News to Frank Sinatra to the Nutcracker Suite it all sounds better. I'm sure you can find a better sounding sub out there somewhere in cyber space but not for this price! This does everything well and at a price I can afford to own it. I believe you would be well served by having one.  Just in case you were wondering about break in time I liked mine right away. But!!!!  It sounded better after about 100 hours of play. I thought it was quite noticeable too. Just has a much softer and smoother sound quality to it. Lots of bass when it calls for it but not as harsh as the first few weeks. (Now keep in mind that it didn't sound "Harsh" to me then but in comparison to now it was.) I like it . Especially for music. Makes  it sound like that small Jazz Combo is sitting right here in the room with me. I love the sound it gives to an Acoustic Bass or Guitar. Very true. Now I'm thinking I will need to get out the old LPs and listen to some of the albums I bought 50 years ago. Hmmm. Maybe I will have more later.
4,My setup: Yamaha R-S500 receiver JBL ES20 speakers and this sub. All running off of my PC with an upgraded sound card.The goods:This sub is capable of clean and tight bass if you get it set up correctly and are looking for fill instead of boomI like the aesthetics of it but that is purely opinion on my partThe connections seem solidThe single-channel input to get what is basically LFE works great without too much effortCapable of being tuned to run in a pair which would be great for a larger room.The sound is great for the price significantly better than what I've heard from similarly priced Yamaha units.The bads:If you get the volume past about 1/3 the sound gets a bit muddy. Fortunately for me I was only looking for fill so 1/3 volume is all I needed.Having the adjustments on the back is irritating if you place it near a wall. I spent a couple hours getting it adjusted to how I like it (no LFE on my receiver) so I was moving it every time but now that it is set all I adjust is the volume.Overall:I would buy this sub again especially at the $100 price point. I didn't expect audiophile quality for this but with careful adjustment you can just about get it there. Anyone complaining that this is boomy needs to turn the volume down all the way and turn it up in small increments until you get enough sound. I find that lower volume on items in this price range allows cleaner sound.A tip for testing; try it with a wide range of music/movies at each volume level that you try. I tried everything from classical (Vivaldi mostly) through dubstep (find something with good quality bitrate) to get it where I wanted it. The volume ended up a bit on the low side but it fills out perfectly without being boomy.A note on good subs; they shouldn't be noticed until they are turned off. My wife constantly thinks that it's not working but I can tell that it is through trained listening. All you should need is a good clean fill of the bottom end.
5,I first elect to start off with letting you know that this subwoofer is going to be more than you expect. I use this subwoofer and my game room which is downstairs in the basement I added this subwoofer to a existing home theater system so just in case you missed that that means to subwoofer's firing at the same time the subwoofer puts out more than enough power to satisfy the average person if you're literally trying to shake the house apart this may not be enough for you then again it may be. The subwoofer is very easy to hook up the adjustments that you may need to do on the back are very easy to understand and overall sulfur sounds great especially considering a basement floor is hard I can feel the base in my chest when I play things like Battlefield 3 with the base coming from the subwoofer in the surroundsound when a helicopter is flying overhead it actually sounds like a helicopter is flying over my house. When I was looking into buying a sub for my home theater system most reviews were really good for the sub with the didn't explain exactly what I needed to know just remember the subs were provided for power than the average person will ever need overall I am very happy with my purchase if you looking for something that's going to bring your games to life with a decent sound system this is it if you looking for something that's going to bring your movies to life this is it things like the cars movies the matrix the Star Trek movies and so much more these movies come to life just with having the rights sub a for cons go when and if something pops up all update. But at this time there are pros across the board just remember you looking at easy set up extraordinary power room shaking bass(but still smooth) a really good price having said all that I would have to say I would recommend this to a friend and I would say get it while you can before it goes out of stock or the price skyrockets for some strange reason and also keep in mind that the subwoofer's coming from a reputable company and manufacturer
5,I needed to replace my 25 year old KLH subwoofer after a move and this was the best choice.It provides solid bass with the flexibility that allows for easy setup and connection easy volume control and an auto on-off feature.  Definitely a good value and worth the price especially with the free shipping.
5,We use outside on a screened porch. Really powerful bass. Adds a lot of depth. We can definitely hear the bass thumping inside if we have it turned up. There’s a knob on the back to adjust the strength.
5,This sub performs better than I expected at this price point . I don't know how it would be for home theater  but for home studio playback  it's perfect .
5,Got an 85w x 5 Harmon Kardon receiver. Needed more bass needed a lot more bass. Well this underrated woofer delivers exactly that. I have the woofer volume set to max and I haven't yet touched the crossover. Receivers EQ is set to zero across the board. Now I like a little too much bass and this makes me very happy. If I want more I can turn up the bass on the receiver's eq to get even more. If the wife is watching I give the woofer the reach-around to turn the bass down to about 7 so she's happy.So for example watched that Star Wars ep 8 movie massive yet controlled rumble as the big space ships are flying about - yet folks voices don't get all muddy - sounds PERFECT. Listening to some Run The Jewels (it's rap music..) when the bass drops the whole house shakes yet Mike's thunderous voice isn't all muddy and the woofer holds it together - no popping no distortion whatsoever - at max volume... whoa.. Listened to some of that Black Sabbath Geezer's Bass guitar sounds warm and full but not overly muddy every time Bill Ward smacks the bass drum you know it. I really can't say enough great things about this. For "50w" it keeps up with an 85w receiver which is just crazy. Woofer behaves more like 200w imo.Auto on / off functionality works good the blackness looks good multiple ways to hook it up is great (i'm using RCA mono). Fantastic. More about my settings woofer is at Max volume (there's tons of bass). Sounds good when reciever is at low volume and consistently good up to 85% volume. I haven't yet gotten the eh-hem to run it over 85% receiver volume for fear of my house collapsing. I've kept it at 85% volume for several hours my ears hurt but the woofer remaining vigilant and sounded great.
5,I purchased this item a few weeks ago and wanted to give it some time to "break in" and also to be able to listen to it through a week or two of normal use in all of the ways that I use my sound system.  After a few weeks of normal use here are my thoughts;First this subwoofer is very responsive and clean.  I have used it listening to  music gaming and watching movies and in every different genre it performs with clean sound if tuned properly with volume & cut off settings.  It gets the lows quite well and does not lag behind during any sequences in an action films or in any songs that I have listened to.  I am highly impressed with how clean it sounds.Secondly I would like to comment on the volume.  Some people indicate this would only be for small and maybe some medium sized rooms.  That was the main thing I was nervous about when researching subs and considering this one.  Would it fill my living room (and connected rooms all open space) with clean sound?  I might disagree slightly that it's only for small/medium sized rooms.  I feel that it would be well suited if properly placed in medium to large rooms within consideration of course.  I have a living room dining room kitchen and entry that are all open and connected and make a considerable square footage and it does a very good job of filling the entire living room and connected rooms too with clean deep bass. I currently have the cut off turned all the way up to bypass the crossover and I have the volume just over half way.So in closing I would highly recommend this sub for good clean deep bass that can round out your sound system and for most exceed your expectations.  I sometimes feel that I could turn down the sub just under half way and still get plenty of volume for my setup.  I would highly recommend this sub for most any setup that I can think of!  I will update if anything changes but I doubt anything will change.
5,The only thing that I'm unhappy about is the fact that I couldn't get the Cherry color.  It's a replacement for the Polk PSW110 that started loudly buzzing.  It is essentially the same size as the PSW110 so no problem there.  The good news is that it can be connected to the RCA subwoofer output on my Sonos Connect-Amp with no problem. Also when I first started looking at the Amazon product description for this item I believe I saw the word "wireless" somewhere and there was an embedded article about 3 wireless subwoofers including this one. I knew it couldn't be an included feature at $130 so I started researching and found that Amazon sells a wireless kit the Klipsch WA-2 so I bought it still hoping that the buzzing on the 110 was just a broken or frayed cable wire. When I got it the box very clearly and prominently stated and showed that the subwoofer has to have a WA audio connector on it. As near as I can tell Klipsch is the only company that uses a WA connector and importantly not on every speaker.  I returned the WA-2 and bought the SVS Soundpath adapter instead.  The Polk 110 was useless so I bought this PSW10 connected it using The SVS adapter and it worked immediately.  No problems. I now have a wireless Subwoofer.
5,Before the review gets written you should know I like to have nice things without spending a lot if I can help it.When I read Amazon reviews for this sub I became super excited. When I read reviews of this sub on the AV Forums i became depressed. Audiophiles apparently hate this sub (Polk speakers themselves are a different story) for a number of reasons. The average Joe however will like it for just as many.I decided to upgrade my HTIB system that is probably 10 years old (still in great condition and sounded great) to something updated but still pretty basic. I started with a Sony STR-DH500 4k pass through 5.2 receiver thinking if this sub works out I can spend the extra cash and get a 2nd sub. With 4k still in its growth stages the lower end receiver works well for me. With purchasing that and knowing I would be keeping my original satellites I had to upgrade the sub to something that would work (my orig. sub was not a powered unit). This was larger than the original sub I had and had to enlarge the space it sits in but its classy looking and blends nicely with all the furniture.Upon setting it up and reading through the manual we threw in a movie so I could tweak the sound on it. We currently live in a small 900 ft. apartment and the living area is roughly a 12' x 12' open ended room. It plays nicely if not overly loud at times. There is a volume knob on the back to adjust the settings and once you find the sweet spot it really adds to the soundtrack. Forum members stated it won't work for large rooms as the sub isn't the right size to fill the space with sound but for condos apartments and if you have a dedicated media room it should suffice.I'm by no means a professional audiophile merely an amateur. But I know good sound and understand some equipment's drawbacks. For $99 its a good sub to use if you're in a smaller room.

5,the bass quality is great like very great but this will have limitations like bass distorting at high volumes. However to reach such levels of distortion you need to have a really high volume (which most of the times is not necessary) to the point that you’re asking your neighbors to call the cops on you. Don’t ask me how LOL.
4,I bought one of these bad boys a few months ago and have it set up to a vintage receiver with no low level out so it is daisy chained with the speakers and its built in crossover control helps make that possible.  With this setup and decent equilizer settings i have it at about 30-40% volume in order for it to still be a flat response with the rest of the speakers since its daisy chained showing (and having tested) that the bass will overcome everything at 100% and shake and rattle a small to medium room as much as desired.  So since the price has dropped and it's good to make sure it's a matching sub if you get a second i just got another one of these to pair with my first so that the bass is more spread out evenly. (even though you can't localize the sub by sound.. you sure can feel it stronger on one side of the walls couch etc. so having two really helps balance out the feel).  I have these subs paired with a few Cerwin Vega speakers from the VE line and they are all connected to an old Carver receiver.  The cerwin vegas are pairs of the ve-8 and the ve-5 so those woofers aren't quite big enough on their own to hit lower frequencies with much power so these subs are a must to hear and feel the lower notes that are usually missed out on for most people's listening experiences.I only give it a 4/5 and not a 5/5 because it is 10 inches and thus doesnt have subsonic or even 20-30 hz range hitting so there are SOME sounds you never hear but for a 10 inch at $90 its much better than making the few hundred dollar jump to the next level of bass response in a sub.Also 50 watts is plenty as i have it set to 30-40% volume ... intensity is logarithmic so paying extra for double wattage is not double volume; double volume requires 10x the wattage so 50 watts self powers is plenty for an active sub like this.
3,A separate sub-woofer is almost a requisite for single eight inch wall or smaller satellite speakers for listening to classical music.  And if you watch a lot of Movies you'll likely also desire a sub-woofer for hearing any of the sound effects.  On the flip I always found sub-woofers to be disturbing and likely should  plan on using larger wall speakers in the future to avoid these disturbing sub-woofers.Since I already installed on per channel eight inch speakers due to having wiring skills space limitations and wall speakers being more affordable; I was currently seemingly lacking the bottom half range of the frequency spectrum commonly heard by most other sound systems.  I hate sub-woofers and have owned one in the past but the lacking of a certain frequency range seemed limiting for my system since I enjoy classical music.  Another option double the amount of eight inch woofers or purchase a large stage woofer; of which booth options tend to be unique and requiring more engineering knowledge to ensure enough wattage for all speakers.  So for now I opted for this more common option of using a powered sub-woofer.Bottom line if you enjoy a fuller range of sound may want to design a sound system using two or more eight speakers per channel or using the larger ten inch wall speakers to make-up for a loss in the lower frequency range while listening to classical music without having to resort to a sub-woofer.  For watching TV and Movies one eight inch speaker per channel seems adequate for nowadays.  One will likely only notice this lacking while listening to classical music.PROS1) Has an auto power-off and auto power-on feature which apparently detects voltage on the incoming speaker wires or RCA cabling from the receiver.2) Unlike the photo depicting the sub-woofer without a front grill or cover does have a front grill or cover for protecting the speaker.3) The box arrived damaged on the side but the product was not marred due to it's sturdiness.  The product is also very heavy!CONS1) I like many other older people hate sub-woofers.2) Unlike the PSW12 having a mono/LFE port the PSW10 does not contain a mono/LFE port nor is packaged with a Y RCA cable split cable for mono (eg. LFE) speaker output.  The PSW10 does reportedly have a function for detect incoming mono signal when cabling is attached to the left stereo channel and apparently adequately functions comparably similar or exactly the same when using a Y split cable.  So if you're paranoid you might not get optimal sound you may want to remember to also purchase an RCA split cable if needed.  As for me I just used the workaround as I don't feel like buying an RCA Y split cable as I likely have one elsewhere not readily accessible.3) The auto power on function does not seem to be sensitive enough as the auto power on function seems to require a volume higher than -30.0 dB using my Yamaha RX-V375 connected via mono cable.  Maybe using an RCA Y split cable may resolve this but doubtful.  A workaround is to turn up your stereo beyond -30.0 dB (like every other idiot out there ;-) and then immediately turn the volume down for ensuring the sub-woofer was auto turned on.  I have also tried adjusting the PSW10's volume knob from 50% to 33% then using the receiver's auto speaker calibration function without apparently affecting the auto on feature much or any at all.
5,The subwoofer is a great addition to my 7 channel sound system.  I'm not giving it the highest rating but may in the future when I get my system adjusted.  Last night I rattled the windows and pictures which was neat but not quite what I'm looking for.  Other times I can't quite tell if it is working.  I'm sure I just have to get it better balanced to my liking.  I'm happy to finally have a subwoofer and it does add a lot to music and movies. Especially appreciate the price since I've seen some advertising in the $400+ range which for me is too much.
4,I'm very happy with all my polk speakers
5,I can't imagine listening to music or watching movies with out a sub-woofer.  I had a passive one before this one the powered sub-woofer is the way to go. During frequency tests I can hear down to 30hz and feel down to 24hz.  Keep in mind other people may hear lower than 30hz the fact I can feel it down to 24hz means it is putting out.Honestly listening to Wagner is a totally new experience now. Its driving the cat and dog nutz!
5,Bass range is excellent with no distortion.  I use this with edifier bookshelf speakers and love the sound.Great subwoofer that doesn’t take up too much room.  It comes in attractive black finish and fits under a table like it’s part of the furniture.I would definitely buy this one again.
4,For the price range this has a decent sound.  Not as melodic/musical as I had hoped but I'm comparing it to a much more expensive Sonos sub...if you don't want to break the bank this is a good option.  Probably better for movies than music.
4,Great entry level sub. Just does it's job works well in my 5.1.1 system
4,These are a favorite punching bag for audiophile forums but of course they want you to buy something else that costs close to a thousand bucks instead.  Considering the price you'll add some nice bass in and it will round out your speakers to have any subwoofer at all.  If you can afford to get multiple $1k subwoofers sure knock yourself out.  Otherwise this sounds pretty good.
5,I now have two of these subwoofers hooked up to my LG C1 TV.  By connecting two of these low priced subwoofers together the results improve the low frequencies dramatically as well as spreading the bass around the room.  Here’s a hint.  Give the subwoofers time to break-in by flexing the cones by playing low frequency tones of 30-40hz that can be found on YouTube.  As the stiffness of the new speakers are reduced the low frequencies will improve.
4,The unbelivable suburb sound of crisp bass having the option of switching frequencies to make sure the bass hits you right I can't believe the people at Polk packed this much in this box. Yes it's a little bigger than I thought. But I didn't need to put it anywhere far from me. I'm 18 feet away from my tv and this subwoofer. I only have it turned up only half way. And everything I watch or listen to is just fabulous! I first tested it out on Saving Private Ryan from Nextflix. Just so I get the right amount of bass. After tweaking it's controls that are on the back I found the right balance of bang thud and kaboom! I then tried it on music from Pandora. I kicked off with the Foo Fighters. Then brought it back to old skool Eazy-E. I closed my eyes and I felt like I was in the club. I did have to knock it down a little on the power as when some bass notes came by it would rattle. And after a couple of weeks go by and I didn't even think about it I was watching the super bowl and all my friends were like "wow that's great sound especially the player hits". I did a lot of extensive research. From CNET to users reviewers. THIS WAS THE BANG for the Buck. Pun intended. Thump On! Installed Jan 9th and it's Feb 12th and no regrets. *****UPDATE JUNE 18TH 2017. ***** OK. SO this sub is still kicking. After 6months it was definitely worth it. I did knock it down to 4 stars from 5 stars as I was resetting my receiver and speakers and when I moved the sub 2 of the leg peices cracked and broke off. These are the type of leg peices that are one price and nailed in. I attached three pictures showing the issue. I almost want to take it to 3 stars (one for each leg peice) but the speaker is still kicking loud! In the picture you can see that the leg is nailed in and to fix it you will need to get 4 same size peices. You would think from a company that deals with a lot of engineering that they would get this part right right?
5,I'm not and audiophile. This doesn't mean I don't like good sound I'm just not good at picking everything apart and ruining the experience for everyone else.My system comprises:Denon DM41 mini systemELAC b6.2 loud speakers.That's it.I wanted that sounded awesome without spending any money just like everyone else that doesn't have much money especially $2000 to drop on a subwoofer.I did some research in these Polk's and for the price I thought I could add some boom to my room without breaking the bank. Turns out they fit the bill perfectly and were cheap enough that I decided I needed 2 of them  (turns out 1 would have worked fine)The build quality is above par for the price. They are solid units. As some have said before the front grilles tend to be blown off by the air these things move.Woofers seem well made and look nice. The large port works well .I won't go into detail about the other things im really not qualified to give advice about. I'm a regular guy that listens to all types of music. After fiddling around with these things for awhile I got them to sound really nice by my standards anyway. They are loud they shake the floor and they drive the dog nuts. They worked well with everything from rap to rock to classical. For the price they really improved my stereo and made it more enjoyable. That's all that really matters. I think the average person will be very happy with these speakers. Buy them and mess around with the settings like I did until they sound good then rediscover the lost bass in your music collection.
5,I added this to my 8 inch PA speakers which go as low as 62Hz. I set the sub low pass at about 120Hz and get a nice low end boost and it sounds seamless. Its a nice looking cabinet too.
5,My friend has a polk that slams so i got one not realizing this was more home oriented and couldn’t really crank up enough a decent sized show. which is fine because it’s more focused on quality and is a good speaker :)
5,For the price I paid ($99.99 on Amazon) you absolutely can't beat the Polk Audio PSW10.  Subwoofers are omnidirectional but placement has a huge effect on the quality of sound you get out of it.  Make sure you try it at different distances from the wall and even in corners before making an opinion about the sound.  The one complaint about this sub is that it doesn't have a huge "sweet spot" as far as the volume knob is concerned.  This sub really starts to blossom once you've turned it up about half way.  However at about three-quarters up it starts to get really distorted and boomy.  That is the drawback of buying a $100 or less entry-level sub.  Don't get me wrong though.  In the range that this sub sounds its best it sounds really really good.  You will feel the bass when watching a movie or listening to a good cd.  I think most people will find that it's loud enough.  This sub will definitely be appreciated in most setups.  If you have a $10000 system then why would you cheap out and buy a 50 watt $100 subwoofer?  If you have a $1000 system then get ready to rock like you never have before.  I loved this sub for the week or so that I owned it.  I ended up sending it back because I ended up having more of a budget than I anticipated having when I bought it and I found a great price on the Polk PSW505 (also on Amazon).  That one hasn't been delivered yet.  I was satisfied with the PSW10 but since I could suddenly afford the more powerful PSW505 I had to buy it as it will still be fine if I upgrade my receiver and other speakers.  Anyway if your budget is under $175 you will not find a better subwoofer than this Polk Audio PSW10.  It is very musical and adds a lot to your overall sound experience.  I highly recommend this sub in the specified price range.
4,Great product
5,My living room is a medium sized room.  Previously I was running a Yamaha 10”subwoofer.  It was fine but I had upgraded the remaining speakers to Polk and decided to swap this as well to timbre match things.  Both will rumble in movies and games but this one has way more definition when listening to music.  I’m noticing sounds in the lower register that weren’t there before.  I expected it to be an upgrade but this was very noticeable.  Worth it 100%
5,So we're home more than ever due to COVID-19 and I've got this projector mounted with large 100" screen setup but had one speaker crackling and only "OK" sound.  I've never had a subwoofer after purchasing the Polk Audio bookshelf speakers for the front two I thought I'd add this on.One word:  HOLYFREAKINWOW!  (yes it's a word. well now it is! ;-) )I liked that:1. The instructions were clear about different setup options -- I tried going on the easy using stereo features but ultimately went the route which needed a bit extra cable (source signal into subwoofer then out to front speakers from there)2. Even at low volumes it fills the low end so beautifully3. Using the rear controls we can decide how much thump we want at the lowest frequencies (too much can be unbalanced but totally depends on individual wants.. we have options!)4. MY BUTT CHEEKS SHAKE during the awesome superhero-landing low-bass sequences (don't recall if it was the opening of Umbrella Academy or Altered Carbon or Picard.. it was hilarious and fantastic!).Seriously a wonderful subwoofer .. very very happy with this purchase -- literally has transformed my listening experience!
5,Great product I have them connected to Bookshelf speakers. And since nobody on this planet wanted to give a valid explanation of how such a thing is performed ill help out.1. Buy a Behringer HA400 a very cheap good quality amplifier.2. You will need 1 regular AUX cable(3.5mm) male to male. This is what you will use to connect the amplifier to your computer or phone.3. You will also need 1/4 inch TS adapters because the amplifier does not fit with regular 3.5mm aux cables.(you would need 2 pf these adapters tp be exact one for this aux cable and other one which ill explain later.)4.  2nd cable you would need to connect a bookshelf speaker to the amplifier i mentioned. This will be a 3.5mm to RCA cable. So one end should be regular aux head and the other side of the cable should be a red and white heads. You will need to connect the 1/4 inch TS adapter to the 3.5mm head. This will then go into the amplifier input right next to the input 4th headset plug.5. You will need to connect the RCA connectors to your bookshelf speakers. (at this point your bookshelf speakers are usable ill tell you what else you need if you are going to add a sub woofer.(Optional)6. You need a RCA to RCA cable or regular speaker wire. Connect one RCA red/white to the speaker aux inputs and the other side to the subwoofer. If your bookshelf has only 2 red and white inputs available then thats means you can only use RCA to connect them to the computer. You will need to buycut and install your own speaker wires connecting the speakers to the subwoofer.My Setup: Behringer HA400 amp Edifier R1280T Bookshelf speakers Polk PSW10 Subwoofer.Very good setup Id rather is 8.5/10. I cannot rate it higher only because anything above 8.5/10 would be like concert speakers over 5k watts...But no these will do for any home.
4,We are happy with the sub woofer
5,Works extremely well wish I could put it in my car to give me some bass there too. 10/10 would buy again when looking for bass
5,I had gone through three smaller 8” subwoofers before then came across the glowing reviews for the PSW10.  It was every bit as good as they say like 200% better than anything I had before.  I was so impressed with the musical performance (tightness and accuracy) that I began budgeting for something even better.  Plenty of audiophile forums claimed the SVS SB12-NSD was light years ahead of the PSW10 although it also costed 5x more.  After breaking in my new SVS I found those claims to be much exaggerated. The biggest difference of course being a 12” it could reach down to a bone-rattling 15Hz which I like but may not be everyone’s cup of tea.  For every other attribute the PSW10 was 90% the quality of the SVS for essentially 20% the cost. When I say 90% the quality I mean I had to replay a bunch of songs side by side with both subwoofers and assigned a subjective 10% more tightness to the SVS.  Maybe some audiophiles consider that last 10% improvement night and day but I just call it 10% as in only really noticeable when compared side to side.  In conclusion I concur with many other reviewers you can’t go wrong with the PSW10.  Nothing can touch it at its price point.
5,I’ve had Polk speakers on and off for years so when I needed a sub for a new media room I setup I bought this. Sound quality adjustability features etc. are all excellent. Nothing in the market at this price point comes close to this Polk. This will fill a very large room with great sounding bass and can be easily turned down for smaller rooms. Plenty of power available as well. You have the option of line level or speaker level inputs which is handy. Paired with a tube amp it really handles deep and mid bass peaks and valleys far better than I expected. The one issue is the size. This thing is huge. It’s a big 14-1/2 inch heavy cube. It’s not necessarily a bad thing if you have the space. I had to re-think my original speaker placement plan as a result. Overall I’m very pleased and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this subwoofer which at this price point I feel it’s an exceptional value. For a buck twenty you can’t go wrong. The upgrade to your sound system is immediate and dramatic. 5*
5,I bought the Polk PSW10 subwoofer with a pair of Elac Debut 2.0 6.2 speakers about a month after I bought the Denon PMA-600NE integrated amplifier. I run SPEAKERS OUT from the Denon PMA-600NE to my Stax SRD-7 headphones. I send the SPEAKERS OUT from the Stax SRD-7 headphones to the Polk PSW10 SPEAKER LEVEL INPUT. Finally I send the Polk PSW10 SPEAKER LEVEL OUTPUT to my Elac Debut 2.0 6.2 speakers. No fancy speaker cables or banana plugs just 14ga speaker wire. In my 15x20 living room crossing the subwoofer at 140Hz and setting its volume at 9:00 gives me a beautiful low bass experience. Somehow adding the Polk PSW10 smooths out the highs and gives tremendous depth to the sound even at low (wife-friendly) volumes. Turning the Denon PMA-600NE up to a loud volume (11:00 or higher) creates a concert-like physical experience—deep clear bass with a very punchy kick drum. I could not imagine my stereo system without the Polk PSW10 subwoofer. It simply adds too much goodness to the sound.
4,First let me confess I purchased this to get my neighbor back for always blasting their music after 10:30 at night. I was extremely annoyed at the time so it was a quick decision and the price of this subwoofer made it very easy to decide and purchase. Before I received the subwoofer  I was honestly thinking I hope this thing can deliver a little something. Boy does it DELIVER! The bass on this thing is ridiculous. I didn't even turn the bass all the way up but it started making things on my walls fall to the ground. Using this when I am watching movies is a joy and I feel really immersed in the movie because of how this subwoofer compliments the audio. I would DEFINITELY recommend this subwoofer you will be amazed!
5,I am using this Polk PSW10 subwoofer along with a Polk CS10 center channel and 4  (unknown brand) ceiling mounted speakers that came with our new home.  I have this connected to a Sony DN1060 Home Theater amplifier and a 65" LG OLED TV.  This is a heck of a setup and I have high expectations for all elements to perform well together.This is in a living room with 9' ceilings and 30'x40' room open to a huge kitchen and dining area.  The Subwoofer is located underneath the TV on a fireplace mantel facing the viewers.I have only watched one movie so far (The Martian) listened to some music and watched regular TV programming so the subwoofer really hasn't had a big workout yet.  The Sony amplifier has been "tuned" to this room and these speakers and I have not tweaked the settings on the PSW10 other than that.This is a very robust appropriately weighted (heavy) cabinet--exactly as you'd want with a 10" sub.  I chose the black color and am happy to leave the fabric cover in place for my application.  The connection is a little different from some subwoofers in that it has input jacks for both "left" and "right" subwoofer.  If you read up on this it is not really  necessary to connect both but I went ahead and purchased a Y-connector so that both would receive a signal from my Sony amplifier.  Not sure if that makes a difference or not but I will say that I am quite pleased with how this sub sounds so far.  I can compare this to cheaper 3.1 systems and also a Bose 5.1 system that I have in another room.  This compares quite favorably to my Bose system for sure which was a little surprising.  It delivers a rich room-filling bass without being overpowered and boomie..I would recommend this product.
5,This sub is absolutely perfect. Probably one of the best I've owned perfect bass sound and sontrol don't seconds guess just get it
5,This is a good sub for the money.  It has auto triggering so it goes into a standby mode when there is the absence of a signal for a period of time.  When the signal is reapplied its instantaneous.  I have heard others where there is a noticeable delay before the bass kicks in.  I have it connected to a Sony 7.2 surround receiver running a " Heinz 57" of speakers.  Klipsch Reference bookshelf speakers  Bose 201s and and old pair of Cerwin Vega AT-12s I have owned for 25 years.  The Polk sub fills out the low end  which is all I needed it to do.Update:  I bought a second PSW10 to help balance out the sound and give even more low end punch.  A few things I see coming up in questions about this sub and subwoofers in general.1.  There are two ways to wire it.  You can connect the speaker leads from your amplifier/receiver to the sub then connect more speaker wire to the speakers themselves.  This is called high level input and when wired this way the sub has a rotary dial in back to select at what point the signal crosses over to the main speakers.  You can also connect vis RCA cables straight from the receiver to the sub in which case the crossover feature is not active2  Anytime you use subwoofers placement is critical.  Low frequencies are omni-directional so the sub does not have to be pointed straight at you.  Also low frequencies have long wavelengths so longer distance from the listening area may produce more bass.  Experiment with placement.  If you are using multiple subs ( x.2 configuration) it is even more critical since one can cancel out the other .  The Polk has a toggle switch on the rear of the cabinet to select 0 or 180 phase to help alleviate this issue.
5,I've been needing to place my old sub for longer than I'd care to admit. When I did I knew I wanted something I knew was going to sound amazing so I knew I wanted to go with a Polk. After reading reviews I took the plunge and HOLY **** I'm absolutely giddy every time I watch something. It's a clear boom with plenty of adjustment to be made to your liking. I want to feel explosions in my chest! And this certainly does it. I'm an audiophile and picky about my bass. I am incredibly satisfied with this thing!
5,If I have one complaint is it is too powerful for my needs… I have for a music sound system in my office on the second floor of my 75 yr old house with wood floors.  I have to set the volume/bass lower to keep from shaking the house. Lol
5,OBJECTIVE:- To revive a decades old stereo system with the least amount of money- Take the bass load off the smaller speakers so they could express better mids and highs- Lessen the power load on the receiver by adding a powered subwoofer- Add more plucky clean musical bass rather than boom and vibrationI could not justify spending a lot of money on my audio hobby right now. An expensive sub or one made for home theatre that's meant to vibrate the house was not in my plans. The more I read about this little sub the more I felt it was worth $100. Now if you forgo the cherry veneer version of the Polk PSW10 you save about $40. With super-saving shipping and tax I paid $108 through Amazon. With another $50 in new speaker wire and banana plugs and pins I basically built a new speaker system.Once I got the unit unpacked I wired it up and started experimenting with the placement volume and low pass in order to make it work seamlessly with the main speakers. [Note on wiring: my receiver has no sub outputs so I had to wire everything through the sub's crossover using   Monster QuickLock MKII Gold Flex Pin Connectors For Easy Self Crimping Terminations - 2 pr        . It was easy enough. Use a run of speaker wire from your amp to the sub and then another run from the sub to the main speakers].Some reviewers complained of booming muddy bass from this unit. I experienced this at first so I moved the sub around the room in different positions and at different sub volume settings. Every room amp and set of speakers brings a bunch of variables to positioning so take a few hours to work out the kinks. My particular listening room is very small (10' x 10') and anything above the 4th increment on the sub's volume just destroys the music. That being said CD's and downloaded music also vary in quality and mixing. I recommend placing the sub in such a way that you can always access the back panel to make adjustments.CONCLUSION: So far I definitely think I got more than my money's worth. If you have small speakers an old system or you just want to add a little zip to your musical experience I say this is a great place to start. I can hear new dimensions on my CDs and the main speakers sound much more spacious and clear.
5,A couple of years ago my Klipsch Promedia 4.1 speaker system I used for my PC failed due to the internal amp crapping out.  It sounded awesome with anything I played on it up to that point.  Money was tight so I replaced it with an inexpensive Logitech X-540.  This was adequate for video watchng and game playing and even did okay for most music but it really showed it's limits there.  However I recently upgraded my home theater AVR to a better one (Onkyo TX-SR707) and decided to use my old AVR for my PC with the old Klipsch speakers (I cobbled together a 20 year old Pioneer receiver to drive the Klipsch sub unit).  This performed better than the Logitech unit until the Klipsch Sub unit blew the speakers.  Enter my need for a new powered Sub.I got the Polk PSW10 unit because it was inexpensive even in comparison to some of the smaller sub units I would have gone with.  My expectations were for it to perform at least as well as the Promedia sub unit but probably not as well as the Velodyne powered sub in my home theater.  I have to say I'm quite pleased.  The Polk unit sounds better then the Promedia unit.  I can't say how it compares to the Velodyne because I'm too lazy to swap the units to compare them.System:Sound Source -- Asus P6X58D Premium onboard Realtek multichannel audio outputAVR -- Kenwood VR-407 (set up in 6 channel analogue mode to PC)Speakers -- Klipsch Promedia front and rear speakers Polk PSW10 Sub (4.1 config)Benchmark Music:King of the Dancehall -- Beanie ManTremble (I love Trace edit) -- Marc et Claude(Take Me Away) Into the Night -- 4 StingsDamaged (Cage mix) -- PlumbThe Chain -- Fleetwood MacFar Away -- Nickelback (I've found this song to be the most demanding on the subwoofer for some reason.

4,I bought two of these because my Definitive Technologies Pro Sub 1000 died after 8 years. I solely based the purchase on the reviews/price point. My receiver has  two outputs for subwoofers so I decided to get two when I only had the one DT.  I have to say I was initially a bit underwhelmed. I was expecting  a lot more bass especially via two subs but that was not the case. It just didn't have the same effect as my DT. Now the DT cost close to $500 and BOTH of these cost under 200 so what did I expect right? After fooling with the output of both my receiver and the speakers I did finally get a somewhat decent sound that I can live with. I have to keep the volumn totally turned up on the subs to achieve the results I like. I only had to have the DT at half. I do not play music on my system strictly TV or movies so I have no review of that sound quality. Overall not bad but I'm glad add I got two.***  Additional review after two days: OK I will now rate these as 5 star after I figured out that it was operator error/mistake in my receiver setup that caused the lack of bass from these speakers. I found out that I did not have the output to the subwoofer turned up from minimal. Once I cranked it up Voila more bass!  Excellent.  Now I can turn down the master volume on the speaker to just bit above 1/2. I was also having an issue with the auto shutoff feature not working.  It would go into sleep mode but then would not wake up on a signal return.  Well that again was caused by me not having a high enough output to the subwoofer on my receiver. Another issue solved now it works great. Very happy now.....great purchase.
5,I bought the PSW10 to replace my Yamaha YST-SW216 that recently gave up the ghost. It was a good budget subwoofer that lasted me over 12 years. Honestly I wasn't expecting much out of the PSW10 but once installed and dialed in this little subwoofer rocks! I mated it with my Yamaha YSP-800 Sound Projector and they've been playing very well together. The SW216 by Yamaha is highly rated as a best buy for an entry level low cost subwoofer. Too bad Yamaha decided to discontinue them. The new NS-SW050 and SW100 replaced the SW216 and I considered the SW100 before deciding on the Polk. The Yamaha only utilizes a single RCA IN for hookup. No volume or Xover control at all on the amp. Very limited. The PSW10 has both L/R RCA INPUTS Speaker Line Level Volume Xover Phase and an Auto ON/OFF switch. Build quality is pretty decent also and for $99 bucks ya can't go wrong. So yeah if you want a decent quality sub and don't want to spend a lot of scratch then this is definitely worth considering.  Don't be deceived by the 50W RMS 100W Continuous Power ratings. This little sub has plenty of 'OOMPH' for just about any rig and small to mid-size room. If your rooms larger you can always buy 2. And at this price you won't break the bank either. Well done PolkAudio. :)
5,This is probably the best subwoofer for the money and the best one I've ever had coming from an old 4 inch sub from Dell. Just so you know you will either need to stuff a T-Shirt in the port or remove the port grill by unscrewing the amplifier panel in the back. It was making a terrible chuffing sound and I thought I had blew it or something but it was just the air sound. Slight modification and you probably couldn't be much happier with this if your expectations aren't insane. It will play as low as about 35 Hz before dropping off rapidly. This will shake and vibrate your whole room windows doors you name it on only 1/3 of the max volume!!! I haven't been brave enough to crank it higher than 50 percent but let me tell you for only 50 Watts RMS this really still has a kick to it!
5,Do you need a subwoofer? I wondered the same thing both for standard audio (Jazz in my case) and videos.  I decided to give it a try.  It was only after I connected and calibrated the subwoofer with my Yamaha 7810 I realized how much I was missing.  The performance is subtle but surprisingly necessary for straight ahead jazz. Not overwhelming but definitely enhancing the listening experience.  That visceral punch from live performances was missing in the recorded sound until I added the subwoofer.  Streaming video was much improved.  I found it surprising how many scenes' emotions  are underlined by low range music and sound much of which I was missing until I acquired the subwoofer.  I suggest that your settings be subtle when implementing the subwoofer.  If your system self calibrates like the 7810 then you will be good.  Set the audio filter to full range for automatic calibration. Should your settings be manual then I recommend you start with the filter at full range and the amplitude settings set at a lower level and then grow into the proper level.  Overwhelming the core music with the subwoofer crushes the music. This product transcends its price point well performing beyond expectations.
5,I bought the Polk Audio PSW 10 subwoofer to augment a stereo system at our camp which has a pair of homemade bookshelf speakers as the main speakers.  These would not be called bookshelf speakers today as they are about 22" X 10" X 8" and are a ducted port bass reflex design with Electro Voice 8" woofer/mid-range cone speakers and horn tweeters with an appropriate crossover and volume control for the tweeter.  I have them standing vertically on the floor and they remind me of those fine old KLH speakers of days gone by.While these speakers put out an adequate sound and are very nice in the mid-range and higher frequencies the bass is definitely thin.  Enter the Polk at a very reasonable price and the system takes on a real transformation with rich bass especially in the lower strings and the mid-range sounds even better than before since the 8" drivers are now relieved of having to produce any of the real lower frequencies.I decided to wire the system according to one of the options in the Polk manual whereby you run the right and left high level speaker outputs from the receiver directly to the sub then connect the main speakers to the speaker output terminals on the sub using the subs internal circuitry crossovers etc. to control what goes to the main speakers and what goes to the sub.  Since the sub has controls for matching the phasing between speakers and sub as well as the crossover point and the sub’s volume you can easily create the perfect transition between main speakers and sub and get the overall sound you want.  For some reason this approach is often disparaged in favor of a line level connection to the sub when in fact amazing results can be attained by using the above approach.This is a terrific subwoofer and should be given serious consideration in any system where some augmentation of the lower frequencies is in order.
4,Like the title says. Still worth the price
5,Easy to set up and completed my sound system. It seems just right to improve the sound quality for home theater
5,I was setting up a new system for my gym/mancave and really wanted to go with Bose. I've sworn by Bose for 25 years but after spending many pretty pennies on my gym I decided to compromise (I thought) on the sound system. My setup is a 20yo Yamama receiver with the Polk PSW10 Bass S20 front speakers & S15 rear speakers...So this review is really for all the Polk speakers. Maybe it's just the different room maybe it's the different setup but these Polk speakers absolutely kill my Bose AM10 system (which has a brand new receiver). The bass is chest thumping. You will FEEL it and if you have one your wife tell you turn it down! I have the bass set to neutral on the receiver and only at 1/2 on the sub. Overall the sound is incredibly clean and crisp. And it is everywhere. Somehow it beats Bose's Direct/Reflect system in putting even sound in every corner of the room. The sound truly surrounds you it doesn't come from over there. So you know I highly recommend this system. If I had the coin I'd replace my primary theater system too.The only down side is this: The speakers are big (relative to cube speakers). They will take up some space. They look sharp so they shouldn't take away from a room's visuals or whatever but you'll have to give these babies some space. If you're willing to do that don't pass these up.
5,OH MY GOD.......I recently replaced EVERYTHING in my stereo except the subwoofer. Sony STR-DH550 receiver Micca MB42X for the mains Micca MB42CX for the center and some Micca COVO-Ss for the rears. I even replaced all of the wiring (Amazon's 100' of 16 gauge). I've always really liked my older Yamaha YST-SW45 (45 watt 8" sub).Then I heard a Klipsch 12" sub. I had to have it.After doing some research I found the perfect sub. A BIC 12" sub. The PL-200.So I budgeted myself about $250 for it. All I heard was GREAT things about them.While doing my research I came across this Polk.I've seen it before and usually it's being sold for $100.A few years ago I bought that Sony that goes on sale for $50. It's a 10" with supposedly 100 watts. I have a 4" subwoofer that is louder and has better bass. I returned that one and decided to stick with my Yamaha.So I was hesitant to buy this Polk.But I read all the reviews and did my research. And one day it went on sale for $77!So I bought two.  I couldn't be happier.I've been spending a lot of time breaking them in. I've only set the "volume" on the subs to about half way. I set the crossovers (same for each sub) at 100hz. The Miccas have 4" woofers so they go down to about 100hz. The roll off is almost non existent. These subs compliment the MB42Xs in every way.These subs are so tight. They also boom very well. Not overwhelming but just enough.I recently went to see the Polar Express in IMAX and I have to tell you my "theater" is MUCH smaller but the level of volume crispness and range was comparable to that IMAX theater. (I didn't say better but comparable)
5,I am pleasantly surprised. Does not take much for my amp to power this up. Have it in the living room upstairs. At medium levels I can feel it. I can imagine the 12 inch model. But this suffices for my application. Had to turn it down because it rattled this glasses in cabinets.
5,My receiver is a Yamaha is an HTR-7065 driving a 5.1 set-up with speakers built in to walls. I had a cambridge soundworks subwoofer - one of the originals so 17 years old - between the receiver and the L/R speakers. I bought this PSW10 for a bit more bass. I sit 16' from the front speakers and the room is an open space with vaulted ceilings. Its not an ideal space but its what I have. I bought the PSW10 to get a bit more bass and it lives in the built-in entertainment console. The 7065 has two subwoofer LFE outputs so I wired them both into the PSW10's two inputs. An alternative is to use a splitter but I didn't have a quality one handy. I set the PSW10 to max volume and ran the 7065s automated set-up. I got a W-3 level error: the subwoofer was too loud compared to the other 5 speakers and the 7065 couldn't compensate. I adjusted the PSW10 to half volume and this time got no error and the 7065 has the PSW10 adjusted to -9db. This means the PSW10 is more subwoofer than my other speakers can handle. Still I have not yet run the system at full volume as it is unbearably loud before that point.I primarily watch movies on this thing and occasionally my kids pump dub-step through it. Explosions in movies like Transformers and Edge of Tomorrow are precise and punchy. Sawtooths are distinguishable from sinewaves. "Engine noises" are wonderful and atmospheric without booming. My kids have no complaint about how Skrillex is rendered and as a demonstration of my system dub-step seems an ideal genre: lots of bass both thumpy and wub-wub. On a classical note Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D minor's bass pipes are amazingly rich and powerful and give me goosebumps every time.This is a great price for this subwoofer and I have no need for anything more.
5,I bought the PSW10 to add some bass to a 2 channel stereo system down in a hang out spot in my barn. I love the variety of hook up options on the back panel. Since the receiver down there does not have any sub outs I wired it with the speaker spring connections left channel to sub in and then the out to the left speaker same for the right side. When I powered up the receiver and started playing music I was simply blown away by the quality and sound from this subwoofer. Finally bass that I could feel. In my house I have a klipsch system with both a klipsch 10 and 12 inch subwoofer and this 10 inch sub blows them both out of the water if what you're looking for is big booming bass for your music. I would not hesitate to buy this again and I will more than likely pick up another one for a different system that I'm setting up. I couldn't recommend this any more highly especially at this price point! My friend came over yesterday and heard it and immediately fired up his amazon app and ordered one for himself.
5,I have only had this for a few days but so far i am pretty happy with it. I have a cheap 2.0 channel receiver with a/b channels. I have channel a plugged up to my left and right speaker boxes each with dual 10" subs and dual tweeters.  Since i have no sub output on the receiver i find it very convenient that this polk audio powered subwoofer has high level speaker inputs for connecting directly from speaker channel B outputs. Many subwoofers do no have this option so therefore would not work for me in my certain case. So after hooking up the sub and playing with the levels and such on the back panel i found a happy medium for the bass to coincide with the other speakers i have.  This sub in my opinion has a decent level bass output for movies and music in my living room scenario. I love my music like rock concert loud so i have my music room with 4500 watts of 15" subs and hifi equiptment  but in the living room the rest of the family prefers a not so crazy approach so i really think this sub is great for adding some boom to your set up. I dont think this is for someone looking to make your living room sound like your trunk subs because if thats what you want then you will be seriously upset. This sub adds great bass for music and movies but is not a high performance 15 inch sub that is going to thump like a Run DMC concert. For the money which i found to be one of the lowest cost subs while still keeping the highest star rating in the price range i am happy with my purchase. I have bass in my music and movies now and thats is what i was looking for...
5,I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised by this sub.  I have an older home theater system with a 12" infinity sub that was 350 Watts.  Well it finally quit working and was not serviceable. I was really disappointed because that was a nice sub.  It was really loud with very deep bass.  I was looking at this Polk sub and also a Klipsch sub that is 300 watts.  I figured the Klipsch would be a little closer to what I had but in the end I decided to try the Polk sub because of the price and all the reviews.  Honestly though I was hesitant and thought that I probably wasn't going to like it since I'm going from a 350 watt sub down to a 100 watt. I thought it was going to be too big of a difference.  However it was not nearly the difference I expected.  I am really surprised how nice it sounds.  I'm not saying that it's as good as my infinity was and I can tell some difference but for $100 it is way better than I thought and the difference is honestly not so much that I want to get anything else.  Movies still sound great with nice deep base and music sounds good too.  For the money this sub is awesome!!
5,This is a great quality product from an industry leader at an affordable price.  I honestly do not think you can find a better sub for the money.  This thing exceeds all expectations as an entry-level audio component.  I purchased this on Amazon with free Prime shipping for less than $110.  Amazing...Fantastic deep thundering sound for my home theater system.  Excellent response.  It also adds the thrill of "being there" when I play first-person-shooters on the PS4 (COD: Ghosts is still my favorite!).  It's actually a bit OVER powered for what I am using it for however I just use the volume/power knob and turn it down until the bass matches the need (music vs. movie vs. gaming etc). As another reviewer noted DO NOT let the 50 watts RMS spec deter you or fool you into thinking this thing is underpowered... it is NOT.  :)A big plus is that it comes with both speaker-level and line-level inputs.  I was a bit disappointed that it did not include an LFE input however.  No big deal though.  It also has a variable crossover and volume knob. See the pic I included for the full set of back panel features available to the end user.  It may help some of you to understand the connection options at your disposal.I used it to replace the cheap 6" subwoofer that my Pioneer "home theater in a box" came with.  The difference is astounding.  I also had to replace the Pioneer receiver because the display went out and a couple of the channels quit working so I bought a Pioneer VSX-530-K... it works well with this Polk subwoofer.If I ever need to upgrade my home theater system I know I can keep this sub because it will fit right in with a higher-end system.
5,Use this for my surround sound. Sounds really good and brought everything together.
5,Is there a better sib out there? Yup. Would spending more for something a little better be feasable? Most likely not  unless your an audiophile. This is great for the average family with stereo/home theatre needs.I low passed my front speakers with 8" woofers at 150 hz. They sound way better not playing the low end.
5,No matter what the bass response is on your main speakers you can tune these with the sweepable low frequency to make them sound better. This will not slam you in the chest but does well for the price.
5,I purchased this subwoofer to replace an aging Optimus I had since 1997 and at $110 (free shipping) it was well worth the purchase.  Let me state 1st and foremost that I don't consider this sub to be used in a setup where you are playing consistently bass-heavy music (hip hop for instance) because it really isn't designed for that.  Though it is capable of 'doing the job' if you crank it up it should be noted fairly that really low end bass doesn't necessarily sound 'muddy' just that it appears to be moreso an issue of too much port noise and resonance the harder you push it (watch this video if you need a better example: [...]/user/FIcaraudioBTL#p/u/25/1DXk6nkQous).This is a subwoofer for the average music lover who doesn't require a subwoofer to "bring down the house" and it will do fine with most music but if you are looking for a really heavy low end you might want to consider a 12" model which has a little bit more powerful of an amp though for most I still think this will do very well and above expectation.I listen to many styles of music (mainly rock) and I have this paired with Bose 301 series V bookshelf speakers and an Onkyo TX-SR500 receiver.  I have mine connected to my receiver's "Subwoofer Out" with a Y cable. I can say after now owning it for a little over a year that once it gets past it's breaking-in period it will do wonders with movies and most music.  It plays loud enough even at 1/2 volume.  I have read some turn it up all the way which I find insane because you don't need bass that heavy to be drowning out your music. Half volume can earn you complaints.Don't be fooled by the amplifier rating at 50 Watts...it sounds much better than my previous 10" subwoofer that was downfiring and had 120 Watts.Bottom line give it a buy and if you don't like the sound there is always the return option.
4,A little big for its size but delivers good bass and flexibility in connecting with speakers or receiver. Could use more power/watts rated at 50 - 100 watts.
5,I did a lot of research before buying this subwoofer read the reviews and saw a comparison done on youtube. This speaker compared very well to subwoofers costing twice as much and was recommended by more than one reviewer as a top buy.I was excited to receive it and it came well packed quick delivery. I connected it to my system using 14g cable and after adjusting the volume to where I got the bass I wanted found the sound to be very good. Full bass without distortion. Really adds to the music and movie experience filling my relatively small living room with all the bass I need. I had originally considered getting 2 but have decided that this single driver is all I need.Needless to say I'm very happy with this subwoofer and can recommend it wholeheartedly.For reference I have a Cambridge Sound 80w receiver driving a pair of Infinity column II speakers and a pair of DML design 24x24 w 40w exciters and this subwoofer. The sound is full and can be exciting.
5,After a few adjustments on the low pass and volume controls I really like this subwoofer! It’s so powerful I turned DOWN the volume and pushed up the low pass just a tad. HUGE sound difference! As for the hum one blogger was having make sure and separate this from other speakers by at least a foot.
4,I have had this subwoofer for a few months now and wanted to try it out for a while before writing this review. I have owned a few subs over the years and this is one of the better ones for the price. I am really impressed by the thundering bass I get out of this woofer. I have two bookshelf speakers that I have connected to my pc that I use with my TV that I use for all of my entertainment.  I listen to all my music and watch all my movies this way and this woofer added such life to my entertainment experience.  I highly recommend this woofer to anyone looking to add affordable bass to their system.  *Update* this subwoofer worked absolutely great for one year but unfortunately the speaker coil burned out and now all it does when the bass hits it just pops and crackles. Don't get me wrong it was great while it lasted. To be fair though I really put this speakerthrough a LOT of hell! I listen to music everyday and I'm the kind of guy who likes to feel the music literally! So I only removed 1 star cause If you listen to music at normal volume level then I'd say you're good to go cause I would expect it to last many years!
5,I'm not an techie by any means just a guy who likes movies and music and this became the cornerstone ofmy new set-up.Coming from a set-up - Bose Acoustimass 5 with a passive subwoofer I never felt much depth to anything adding PSW10 changed all of that.  I added Polk speakers for center channel and surround speakers with the Bose remaining as front speakers and it's brought my listening experience to life.
5,I’ll try my best to keep this short. First time buyer of Polk. Saw the hype. Read the reviews. Went with my gut. Bought 2 to complement current bedroom setup:(2) Rockville TM150(2) KRK Rokit 5 G1so... 2 Ginormous boxes arrived today. Prime is a Godsend. Paired 1 sub and KRKs via y cables to TM150 output. Clicked Bluetooth on receiver. Found Wu-Tang Clan’s “C.R.E.A.M” on YouTube... Turned volume all the way down on each device and slowly raised volume levels. Raised sub's level last. All I have to say is if you’re considering buying this sub go for it! I don’t know what type of engineering went into this thing but my walls and floors and possibly neighbors are enjoying the party. Bass somehow gets even deeper as I move these babies around the room. For $90 it’s just an amazing piece. Almost a steal. This is easily a $400 sub. I can’t believe it’s only 50 watts. These things THUMP. They really THUMP. No exaggeration. Deep deep eyebrow-raising heartfelt pulsating bass. Love it. Can't wait to see what all my favorite horror movies sound like. I have the volume turned up halfway and just daaamn. This is a large room with high ceilings and this sub fills it nicely. When you walk in the room and see this thing on the floor it looks like it means business. I should put this in the Maxima and see what happens. Wait I have (2) 12's in there already. Buy this sub. You will like it. I don't work for Polk. Just an average Joe who loves a great sound system whether in my cars or at home.
5,I was totally shocked when this speaker arrived.  I had NO IDEA it was this big heavy and solid.  Polk Audio's product quality is obvious; I'll definitely buy from them again.  It's a solid great-sounding speaker.  If you're adding a sub to a small to medium-sized room this will do just fine.Super easy to setup.  I plugged one end of the cable (RCA male-to-male) into the LEFT RCA input of the sub and the other end into the RCA subwoofer output of my Yamaha RX-V467 receiver.  As others have said I did not worry about splitting the signal with a Y-cable.  I set the crossover to it's highest setting and used the crossover in my receiver instead.  I set the gain of the sub at about 75%.  Others have mistakenly wrote that you can't bypass the crossover which tells me that they didn't read the instructions didn't use Polk's online support and don't know what they're talking about.I paired this with the Polk Audio SurroundBar...another great speaker system.  Also solidly built great sounding and highly recommended.I read some of the reviews here where "audiophiles" were trying to dissect the functionality of this sub at specific bass frequencies (50 Hz versus 40 Hz and lower) and I had to laugh.  Subs are supposed to be "boomy."  The very definition of sound below 40 Hz is "mud" or "boom."  40 Hz and lower should be felt more than heard.  Let me put it this way thunder and rumble in movies I've used it with sound just like the thunder and rumble I've experienced in a real movie theater.  This subwoofer sounds GREAT for 80-90% of the users out there especially if you're using a good receiver and your other speakers are good.For $99 I'm blown away.  You're definitely getting your money's worth when you buy this.  Don't be fooled by the power rating.  It's 50 watts RMS and 100 watts Peak.  More than enough and plenty of boom for most uses.
3,I tried a pair of these but ended up returning them in less than a week. One required to much volume to wake up from standby. They did spit out low tones but not what I would call great. I may be a bit spoiled as a current owner of an SVS PB2000. They do work much better for movies than music. But to my ears the LFE’s coming from this pair sounded manufactured not natural. This was with using a splitter to connect both channels as some reviewers recommended. If you’re not picky about your sound and just looking for something to fill in the bottom end with a bit of rumble these are ok for the cost. I can see why they are so popular. Price sometimes overrides quality on something as subjective as sound. And they do provide a noticeable addition to bottom end.
5,This subwoofer exceeded my expectations! I built an arcade cabinet that I wanted to have a premium sound system in. I first tried a JBL 10” powered subwoofer that I already had and it did not blend good with the kenwood 6 and half inch speakers that I have installed in the cabinet. It would not cut on until I turned the volume really loud and even then it just did not sound good after trying many different adjustments. So then I ordered an Acoustics audio 8” powered subwoofer that did not sound good either. I turned it all of the way up and could barely hear any bass coming from it and after trying many adjustments it just would not put out the bass that I needed. So then I purchased this subwoofer the Polk audio psw10 10” powered subwoofer and after installation before any adjustments it was putting out awesome bass and perfectly blended with my speakers that I had in the cabinet. I was shocked at how good it performed versus the other two options I tried. After adjusting the hrz range and volume my arcade cabinet sounds awesome! This sub produces really good low end and even reaching into the mid range for a perfect blend with my speakers. It never bottoms out and only produces bass exactly the way I want it to sound. For any one on the fence for this sub I highly recommend this sub. Save your self some time and just pick up this sub you will be glad you did.
5,What a great product. Ty
5,Ok I have a 5.1 system all Polk speakers. big center channel bi pole surrounds and 2 cabs that have 4 each 6 inch drivers and tweeters. Powered by a 120 w Yamaha receiverAll bought on Amazon except the receiver. I used to have a 12 inch polk sub...i liked it but never loved it. then the amp plate went out. when I replaced it as Polk gave me a replacement it was under warranty. the red wire terminal was nearly melted to the woofer and carefully taking it out the plastic part broke. I was left with taping it down. That lasted awhile until one day it broke off for good. I got rid of it and glad I did. The woofer on it was a average design at best and the back slot port poorly moved sound.Originally was eyeing the 10 My dad has the ps110 one and that is really weak. I think it's sealed I dunno but this one with the front port pushed hard not as deep as the 12 but I think this is much more efficient and more dynamic. Until it you turn the volume at 75% having the sub output on my Yamaha receiver at 6/10 does tend to slightly distort but not bad.at 1/2 volume it is nice and for most people would be fine. I want mass bass so for 100 dollars get 2!!! Use a Y connector and plug both in the L input and only put at 1/2 volume both together gives incredible output.I have my flat screen t.v. on a stand with my towers on each side in a corner on my living room. Due to the space cannot put them in front buy easily have space to out them side by side.
5,First and foremost experiment with its placement and settings. Once you hit the sweet spot of it all awesome.
5,I'm testing my new Polk Audio PSW10 with a Charlie MIngus record (Mingus Dynasty 1959) and Charles sounds goooood man. Why this Polk? Because I have a Sony receiver that has outputs for four speakers and no "sub out" and the Polk has inputs and outputs for "back speaker" connections that basically allow the Sony to push sound to both back speakers and the subwoofer. So I hooked it up - BTW this Polk is big man I mean it's a 27 pound 14"x16" wooden block that you have to stick wires into correctly big - so I hooked it up and now Charles sounds very goooood. Not bad. Gooood.
5,I'm a lifelong Polk Audio fan and was looking for an inexpensive way to enhance my home office stereo (lucky to be employed in the Covid age but I'm cooped up in here all by myself all day every day).  Using both the optical and headphone to RCA out of an aftermarket Bluetooth receiver I already had... I pieced together an old Panasonic mini bookshelf system (wired from the headphone out to aux-in and disconnected the dedicated tweeter speakers - MIDRANGE) my 20 year old Harmon Kardon amp with a pair of KLH speakers that I bought for $20 20-years ago (HIGHS).... and THIS SUB (LOWS of course).  It went from laughable before the sub to WOW.  It doesn't have the earth shaking ability of my PSW404 but it is very clean and makes for beautiful music.  Not bad for essentially a $120 total expense after reusing 20 year old retired gear.  How could you go wrong at this price?  Just plug in the sub wire the L input to your sub-out (or whatever setup you want) and dial in the frequency and volume as you listen to your favorite tune.  Enjoy!
5,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. The sound quality is great. Highly recommended.
3,This is the least expensive subwoofer. Not the greatest construction. A piece of the enclosure fell out of the box when I opened it. The sound is not well defined. I am using this on a system that I just wanted some bass but didn't really care about the sound quality.
5,It’s Polk Audio. Enough said. Never disappoints.
5,Why and how could anyone give this Sub less than 5 stars? This is an excellent value. Like a few reviewers I am a bit older than most reviewers (at least that would be my guess) I like a good clear sound a nice bass with a subtle thump. No muddy stuff! I owned a Klipsch 12" prior to this and spent five x as much for that sub. It was a good sub - not 5 x as good as the Polk though and there are things I like about the Polk that I didn't like about the Klipsch. It's far more portable I like the front facing speaker (offers more options) I like the subtlety of the Polk over the overpowering sound of Klipsch (although it can be throttled down-maybe just too tempting to rattle the windows but the Polk is good with movies and great for music). The Polk is a very nice well-behaved sub. I set this up with the Y cable and cranked the low pass to max (as the manual suggests)  which allows me to control the sub volume and settings from my amp. The Y cable DOES increase your output by 3db or more and yes it makes a difference - I would not want to match the same sound levels without this - the Y cable makes for a cleaner sound at least from what I've experienced. The Sub is not fully broken in - if it improves with time I want to give it 6 stars - Amazon really took care of me on this one. I have this hooked up to a Sony DN840 amp DLK 1.5 surround Klipsch tower fronts and smaller (going to need to replace these JBL rears. I love it.  Quick delivery great product!!
5,I currently use the PSW10 for my computer setup and I love it. In fact I loved it so much that I ordered a second one for my home theater. Big mistake! While this sub works AMAZING underneath my desk it struggled greatly when pushed to the appropriate volume to fill my living room booming with distortion. What's also a bummer about this sub is that it has NO LFE input. While this isn't a problem on a stereo system (in fact it's perfect for a small stereo system - see original review) it is not ideal for a home theater as the sub can't receive the LFE signal from any Dolby Digital or DTS stream.  Instead I purchased the BIC F12 for my living room and it puts the PSW10 to shame in every way shape and form. However when lowered to the same volume appropriate for under my desk it's hard to find a difference between the two.DO NOT get this for even a moderate-sized living room. The only size home theater setup I could see this sub working in would be a dorm room. Small applications only! Under my desk I can push the volume up to the point it's rattling objects off and before it starts distorting. But once I leave the general area of my desk however the bass is not very impressive.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm a video editor and I despise consumer computer speakers but also despise the price of professional audio equipment just as much. With this sub along with a pair of Mackie CR4's connected to a Y splitter on the headphone out of a 5K iMac this is the perfect sound setup for a professional video editor who wants professional sound without having to pay professional prices.
4,Great subwoofer however the cable sold with the 10 is for the 12. The 10 needs a Y cable to really shine. See my reviews and find a nifty long and fuctional Y.
4,Affordability very good bass  Can’t get anything better for the price
4,Got this for my son for xmas he really likes itsounds good looks on the large size 10" woofer get 12" single wire input
5,I got this to augment a pair of Yamaha NS-10M Studio monitors that I use while sitting in front of a computer screen digitizing vinyl records.  The Yamahas are great but they're only 6" in diameter and don't produce much of any bottom end.  I put the Polk subwoofer under my desk and all of a sudden it seems like my little Yamahas are reaching down to the bottom of any rock record.I'm a guy who likes a tight punchy bass for rock music and am not interested in the sort of home theater bass that's good for creating explosions in superhero videos.  I dislike that Bose-style murky bass that most consumers seem to go for - I want a bass where you feel the kick drum in your chest even at modest volumes and this one does this.As for hook up this one is well designed to use in a stereo.  You run the speaker wires from your amp to the subwoofer and it has a variable crossover that decides which frequencies to play through the subwoofer and which to route onwards to your main speakers which are connected by another set of speaker wires.  The Polk is powered so it can set the volume of the subwoofer relative to the main speakers as you want it to be.  It took me a couple minutes of playing with the crossover and the volume to get settings that works great and these don't need to be touched as you change the overall volume out of your amp.You can also use a line in hookup but that's not what I'm doing.Anyway I'm thrilled with this.  And for $89?  That's crazy.
5,This Subwoofer is incredibly powerful great for family rooms of all sizes.  Great control and rich sound.Highly Recommend.PS. Do not buy if you live in an apartment unless you want to meet the neighbors...a lot.
5,Great product........
5,I have to admit that I had my doubts and hesitated for months on buying a $99 subwoofer.  Much to my surprise it has exceeded all expectations.  Keep in mind that bass output has a lot to do with placement size of the room and the signal sent to the speaker.  I am not expert but found various websites that offer good guidance in these areas.  I have the sub frequency turned down to the lowest setting and volume up about 90% in a theater area of my basement about 15x 15.  It rattles the walls and seats during action and bass in music.  I can’t imagine needing any more bass than this.  Keep in mind the smaller size of my space and the corner of room placement really pounds out the bass and is as good or better than the theater. I have it hooked up to a Denon avr-x2000 which is sending a really clean signal.  For the price I cant imagine Or fathom  huge improvement to step up to higher end subwoofer it’s already close to too much.  Don’t question just buy.  If your setup is similar to mine you won’t be disappointed.
5,I can't turn my receiver all the way up and this speaker still BOOMS! My son said I'm going to knock the clock off the wall.  The bass output is serious! I say buy it!
5,The bass is clear and undistorted.Not boomy at all it just unobtrusively adds a very nice low end to my stereo.
4,I use these on modern pinball machines to improve the sound quality and they fulfill the need.As of this review the Black Friday deal is currently 30% higher than what I have paid for them on AMZN in the past.
4,For the money its ok you certainly are getting what you pay for.  I had a hard time integrating this in with my ELAC B6 speakers which only need a little help on the lower end this speaker for my room which is about 20x20 was ok and seemed to produce better in the higher end.  I was replacing it with a Energy encore Sub and the Polk PSW10 was not a good replacement.  I felt the Energy fills in where needed much more than the PSW10 could.  The Energy seems to dig a bit deeper and pronounce itself and I believe this is due to the fact that its 50W RMS which is 50W more than the PSW10.  On the PSW10 I had to turn the volume up quite a bit just to get a decent amount of sound to fill the room but this added a little port distortion on the sound and I lost the punchy feeling of the subwoofer.  So I put the Energy sub back into place to get the sound I was use to back.I moved the PSW10 into my computer room which is 8x8 and paired the sub with a couple of Klipsch desktop speakers and a Breeze Audio amp.  the sound reproduction is really good in a smaller environment and the after messing around with the PSW10 I am pretty happy with it.  So for most of you looking to fill in the rumble of a sub keep this one in a smaller room no larger than 10x10 IMO it would be OK for that but any larger of a room I would jump up to something that has a little more power.
5,Like the looks and used for home Dj set up it’s a very nice add to the sound system it completes the way a vinyl record should sound
5,I bought a Polk Audio surround system with one subwoofer. While I was real happy with the quality of the system the sound was a bit off center. I purchased this 2nd subwoofer to even things up. Now I have one for each side of the room. This evens out the bass completes the system & yeah I like it.
5,I was looking for a sub to add to my home-theater and home-audio setup without spending too much.  I appreciate quality audio but I'm also fine with getting along with inexpensive gear as long as it sounds good enough.  This sub definitely falls into that category.As with any speakers and especially subwoofers placement is key.  Low-frequency sound radiates with a pattern that is much closer to "in every direction" than the higher-frequency sound that your main speakers produce.  That means that the optimal place for this sub is probably not pointed straight at you.  The room that you place it in will have a large impact on how loud it is and *where* it is loud.  For starters try placing the sub in a corner.  If you cannot place it in a corner place it against a wall.  If aesthetics allow experiment with pointing the driver towards the wall or into a corner... depending on the room and what objects are in it this can amplify the bass.Also don't forget the phase switch.  After you have found your sub placement have someone help you out by switching the phase between 0* and 180* while you sit in the main listening area.  One of the settings will be louder!This unit has only a single drawback (that I've found so far):  it has no true "off" setting; you have to unplug it to get that effect.  The "auto-power-on" mode is a little liberal for my taste... for some reason it is almost always on.  If you are concerned with energy consumption you should be aware of this.  The sub doesn't draw that much power even when turned up loud though--maybe 10-15 Watts from the wall (1 second averaged--instantaneous peak draw is likely much higher but I don't have a meter fast enough to report that).
4,The sound is good and infinitely better than the subwoofer it replaced but now on to other things: One silly little feature which I find that I especially like is the simple toggle switch on the back which turns the speaker on and off. It splashes a bit of green light when the speaker is on and a bit of red light when it is turned off. I have it on the floor at the left side of my TV and other components in such a way that I can see the splash of light reflected off the paneling behind just enough that I don't have to lean way over to eyeball the toggle.  Why do I care? I don't like the idea of leaving the speaker on all the time for a variety of reasons including my suspicion that its predecessor died from just such treatment.  I should mention that this feature was in no way a bargained-for benefit.  I didn't realize when I placed my order either that it had an on-off toggle switch or that it came with a miniature light show.  Each of the other seven speakers in the system turn on and off with the receiver of course but the subwoofer never does.  It separately plugs into an outlet and processes sound sent to it from the receiver whenever that occurs always on and ready.  I cannot know of course if leaving my now discarded P.O.S. subwoofer plugged in and turned on at all times as it necessarily was shortened its life. I do know that I enjoy being able to turn the new one off.  My Onkyo receiver is designed and wired to accommodate a second subwoofer.  If I ever talk myself into that nonsense this is the one I will get.
4,My second purchase of this subwoofer.It's a welcomed budget addition to my front stage of my home theater system.The bass quality is okay digging deep enough to satisfy most beginners in the hobby in my opinion.It would be nice even at this price point for a remote to have better access to the volume control as it is located in the rear of the subwoofer.Overall the sound quality is acceptable and pleasing as long as you don't push the subwoofer to or near it's limits.Do I recommend this subwoofer ?Yes  out of all the "budget" subwoofers I've had the chance to listen to the polk takes the trophy for cost versus performance.
5,I PAID $79 before Christmas. The Cost of nice dinner out with the wife with drinks or 1/2 of a North Face Fleece Jacket. How they can Build and free ship a quality sub woofer for this  low a cost is mind blowing.I use it for all types of music at low to moderate levels with a 100 watt receiver and Polk monitor 30 series two speakers (excellent also). I say moderate volume but my wife says it is loud but having attended many concerts I can tell you if you want distortion free concert level volume in a 20 by 18 room this is not the set up you need to spend way more. But really how often and how long do most people really listen to music at that high a level.I have it set at 80HZ  crossover and about 1/3 volume on the back panel. It fills out the Monitor 30s very well  and since it is hidden by furniture I have fun playing the system for friends and ask them if they have ever heard a small speaker go so deep. They are amazed. I think that a sub woofer should not stand out just be there when needed then deliver the low base which it dose down to about 40HZ very well.So if you are one of the few reviewers who did not see the value here WAKE UP and don't be a DOPE! For $79 a it's a steal. Way better than what comes with the packaged surround sound systems from the big box stores. Also my buddy with a 2 times more expensive BOSE system has put it on crags list and ordered the Polk Monitors 30s and the PSW10 sub. Value......
5,Bought this for a little something to shake the house and it does shake the house. I was contemplating pulling out my old 2 12" Kicker Comp but this is adequate maybe I'm growing old. But now I'm more focused on clarity and the level of responce. Loud is one thing precise sound is another. With my amp it works out and sounds quite nice the option to 180 flip and auto on is nice to have. Also the design is minimal but also looks great. The footing is make of hard plastic but it does not rattle at high output trust me. I checked. Hood stuff for a hundred bucks.
5,I was originally hesitant about buying a 10-inch subwoofer. My previous one was a 12-inch 400 watt Logitech and I wasn't sure how this would compare. But after reading so many positive reviews and it costing only $96 after taxes I pulled the trigger and ordered it. When it arrived I was surprised by the size of the subwoofer itself. It actually seems larger than the 12-inch it replaced!As for sound quality at first I had it sitting under my computer desk. This led to the sound being muffled and anemic almost. I thought there was no way it could sound so weak so after reading around online about sub placement I put it against the wall in an open space. This time I played the T-Rex scene from Jurassic Park and the sub actually vibrated the floor! So if you purchase this sub proper placement is crucial for the best bass response. As for the rest of my setup I have this sub paired to a Sound Blaster X7 which is also powering a pair of E-MU XM7 bookshelf speakers. They actually go together nicely with the sub filling in the low-end with nice rumble without overpowering anything.Now if you're looking to anger your neighbors and rattle the windows look elsewhere. But if you're wanting to shake the floor when watching action movies and give your music a nice thump. This will do that just fine. Overall I'd say if you can get this sub on sale it's a steal. And if the rest of Polk's products are as nice as this sub. They'll probably become my go-to brand for speakers in the future!
5,Great size and great sound. Perfect addition to our surround sound system.
5,Great sub this is the first sub I’ve bought and I’m connecting it to a Yamaha receiver and two Polk floor speakers.  On full blast the paint starts coming off the walls and for casual music listening and movies it sounds great.
5,I'm not a fan of boom. I listen to jazz electronic classical with a little rock for fun. I want to hear my speakers and I want to augment and accent the lows without getting in the way. I can't afford the high-end stuff. I am so pleased.
5,While this isn't technically an outdoor subwoofer in the application I am using it that is its purpose. I have a metal roofed gazebo this will live under 8-9 months out of the year and I purchased this cover to ensureit lives a bit lobger on the patio https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HY2V4K3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.Sound quality is great and I love the ability to tune at the sub for frequency and volume instead of having to do this at my amp. This sub is supporting two Definitive Technologies AW 6500's and is the perfect low frequency fill-in for our outdoor setup. I will update if anything changes long term but I am very happy with the purchase and not having to bury a subwoofer anywhere in my yard.
5,All about that bass. Bass is adjustable. Works perfect provides nice clean bass. Movie theater quality.
5,Just what we were looking for and at a great price!
5,My old Onkyo receiver went kaput so I got a nice relatively inexpensive Sony one to replace it (STRDH550). I didn't need new speakers since my Onkyo setup had come with a nice set of speakers but I did find that my new receiver didn't want to drive the passive sub from the Onkyo set. I picked up this highly rated Polk sub and it's not hard to see why it's so highly rated.Connection was simple. I got a nice high-quality RCA cable (MediaBridge MPC-ALR-25B) plugged the sub into the receiver and cranked the low-pass dial all the way and the volume dial to about half-way. Then I ran through the receiver's easy setup menu: you plug in a special mic and set it near your seating area and then the receiver "listens" to itself as it plays tones through all the speakers... and then the sub... Oh the sub!Once the receiver's speaker calibration was finished I opened up Pandora on my phone and began casting to the Chromecast Audio connected to the receiver. My first test was to play my dance station; Pandora chose a nice four-on-the-floor Cascada track and the sub thumped like a beast. My next test was to play a movie. I went with Iron Man and again the sub delivered wonderfully.I'm really enjoying it so far and a friend who visited last night even remarked on how awesome the explosions were in a movie we watched together. If you're wanting a solid subwoofer that won't cost an arm and a leg you could do a whole lot worse than this guy.
4,Im not an audiophile however ive read some reviewers complaining about distortion inherent in the psw10. After testing the speaker at various frequencies between 40-200 Hz with different types of distortion ( waveforms) I found that the speaker faithfully reproduced pure sinewaves perfectly and faithfully reproduced the distortion in the those test signals with distortion. The speaker did exactly what it was designed to do. In addition there is no need ( at least I've found) to have the subwoofer playing at high volumes since to marry the entire audio output for your selection videos or music the lower frequencies are played at substantially lower levels to achieve a desirable total presentation so the speaker never gets into the non-linear area of the amplifiers gain specs. In addition it should be noted that the quality of the audio signals presented with many streaming and other sources are not without some some noise and if played at unnecessarily high volumes will produce distortion and this is not a problem with the speaker but with its signal input.  I think after trying many settings with my AV receiver and the speaker for a few days that the speaker is an excellent value. Note again i am not an audiophile but a retired electrical enginner so i can only conclude that for my ears it is a fine addition to my home theater audio system. Very satisfied.
5,More than I thought it would be !
5,I was a bit reluctant about buying this sub.  How good can it be at the price-point?  I've been using it for 30 days now and here some thoughts that might help you if you're asking yourself the same question.Let's start with design: it's solid.  The cabinet has heft to it and is not flimsy in any way.  Keep in mind it's big though.  If you're looking for something small and invisible this is not it.  While it's not huge it's certainly cannot be called small.  I have it near a plant in a corner in my living room so I never see it but it is big - be sure to take a look at the dimensions.Buzz static etc: I have not run across any humming or static when the sub is not in use.  I used mediabridge's sub cables and highly recommend them.  The cable is inexpensive but well made.  I wonder if other reviewers who reported hum etc may have just been using bad cables.Sound Quality: I'll break this down into movies and music.  It performs well for both but I do think it's more oriented towards movies and "boom" rather than fast-punch mid-bass like smaller subs.  It's a 10" sub so don't expect it to perform like an 8" when listening to music.  That said though I never feel like I made a bad choice when listening to music with it.  On rare occasions I wish it was "punchier" but for 99% of the time I think the sub just sounds great.Bottom line: it's the best sub you'll find for the money.
5,great sounding sub for my home Theater. great value for the pricd
5,I don't review products. But when I do it has to be amazing. Ok but in all seriousness this subwoofer is incredible. I got it when it was on sale for $99 about 11 months ago and It's still going strong. I know most people reading reviews want to know how it compares to others in the same price range. I can't do that since I haven't heard the others but what I do know is that this thing rocks! My last subwoofer was from from a super cheap home-theater-in-a-box so that's where I'm coming from. My listening area is approximately 12x16 and I never feel as if the sub is struggling even when I crank up my music loud. I used the speaker level inputs and am now using the line-in and they both work great. Love that it has an adjustable crossover. One small complaint I have is that the auto-on won't always turn on if you are listening at a very low level. However I've never had an issue with it for "normal" tv listening volumes. Overall highly recommend!
4,Hard to beat. I use this sub utilizing the speaker in/out connections from my Yaqin valve amplifier. The sound is very good! No reduction in output or sound from my Infinity tower speakers and properly adjusted the Polk adds just the right amount of "lower punch" missing from my 6" Infinity's. If you want to rock this sub will definitely do it! I see no reason to get anything larger for my needs. I barely have it turned up and it sounds great. It'll rattle the picture frames!Took me a few days messing with the overall volume lowpass and the phase switches to get in my "sweet spot". But once it is set about the only thing I've found myself doing is reaching back to adjust the volume depending on the genre of music I am listening to. Gary Numan requires a lot less than say The Beatles or Floyd.The instructions are kind of lacking. Printed in about ten languages they can be confusing to follow. But it's a sub so not hard to wire. It does have the capability to run under many different configurations from sub/RCA line level and speaker level. I bought it exclusively because my valve amp has no dedicated sub out and can only really handle two speakers (unless you get creative).So all in all very pleased! Lots of YouTube vids about some mods you can make to reduce vibration but I haven't needed to do this. And the price definitely cannot be beat! It's very well built and has looks to go along with that. Enjoy!
5,I love buying on the 80/20 rule (where you find a product that provides 80% of the benefit at 20% the cost). Polk knocked it out of the park in that regard with this one. It’s truly astounding you can get bass this good at this price point these days.Don’t get me wrong this sub sounds “good” not “great”. But you’d have to spend $100’s more to get much more.I’ve been an avid audiophile for over 20 years having bought and built many subwoofers (including the famed “Tempest alignment” - Google that!). I would classify this sub as partway between a low frequency effects subwoofer that provides tactile effects to movies and a properly musical subwoofer. I’ve got it paired with an older pair of MB Quart bookshelf speakers and the transition between them isn’t great when it comes to SQ but I’m very satisfied for the price point. Well done Polk!
5,My favorite home subwoofer... I have three of these in different rooms for years now and I play a lot of heavy bass rap/reggae music. These things perform and can take a beating. On the other hand I had 3 of the 12" versions and they all blew on me in a matter of weeks. They are just sitting in my garage collecting dust... about $1000 down the drain... avoid the 12" at all costs
4,I was not terribly impressed when I first got this sub in late 2014 but I confess I didn't really spend the time to read the manual on it or on my receiver. Once I realized there was a pass-thru setting on the sub and once I set that up properly through my tuner with LFE it really came alive.It used to make some slappy-fart noises on bass intensive tracks at high volume. Properly setting the sub up rectified that as well as the initial boominess it exhibited. I also do not keep the plastic framed speaker felt on the subs as they are prone to rattling.Some people on here report covering/damping the port improves the performance of these subs. I have not tried that so I cannot comment on it. I can say that up to reasonably loud volume levels the units provide a crisp low distortion output. However one will get some ugly sounds out of it if you try to turn both your sub amp and source volume to truly loud volumes. At these levels there seems to be undue movement and extension of the cone and it doesn't look or sound healthy. Mine are trimmed at well-lower output levels and provide concise bass all the way up to the top volumes that I would ever explore.I bought a second one and now run two of these in my basement media room and I can tell you one would have been sufficient in a 10 x 24 room two is dynamic and impressive even at lower volumes.
5,Much better than expected.  Knocked stuff off of the mantle from across the room.
5,Once you get it set up properly it will be the darling of your budget home audio system. I recommend using speaker wire to loop your front speakers through the rear of the unit and totally bypassing the sub input on your receiver. This passes your line speakers that would normally go through just the receiver into BOTH the sub unit AND the receiver. Your sound quality will improve dramatically once your line-in input passes through the built-in pre-amp. I highly recommend this subwoofer if you have other Polk Audio equipment. I have some likely forgotten Polk tower speakers from the late 80s and run them plus this sub through a Denon AVR 1312. The sound in my living room is nearly movie theatre quality. I am ordering a center speaker from this brand soon to complete my beginner home theatre. This unit is compact enough to throw on your tv stand but EASILY capable of getting the police called on your house if you get careless with the volume. Completely recommend 5/5
4,Very good sub-woofers are quite sophisticated devices in some ways. Lots of thought goes into the materials the cabinet shape and size the type of amplifier a carefully selected drive unit and lots of attention paid to how all these components work with each other in certain types of room etc.For under $100 however you get basic cube with a driver an amplifier and a USA big box store brand name attached.There's a useful selection of controls on the rear panel however including an in and out series speaker wire feed (for amplifiers and receivers which have no RCA sub-woofer/pre-out feed).If you have a desire for more bass than your current speakers can offer (especially smaller speakers) and you have a budget of around $100 you could do a lot worse than buying one of these if you want something new.It's not a tight or deep bass delivery but it's never going to be in this price range. How this can be sold for less than $100 is beyond me given the cost of shipping on larger heavier items such as a 10" sub-woofer.Recommended at the price but if you are insatiable in appetite for something detailed and expansive in it's bass range you'll need to deepen your pockets get out to a dealer and actually compare.
3,Strong bass.it get a little warm in the back metal plate
5,Polk audiois the best I have a set of Polk Audio monitor 10b still sound great after 39 years.
5,I find this to be a great unit in every way. This Subwoofer is used as an add on unit to a Polk Signa S2 soundbar system which comes with Bluetooth 5.25 inch Subwoofer (which might be enough bass for some folks).  Adding this 10 inch powered Sub has REALLY pleased the deep old school audiophile in me. I'm hearing what one hears when visiting a pro audio store! It is great to know that one doesn't have to spend 2000 bucks for clean professional sound for one's living room or den. My Sub is connected to the soundbar's AUX output so 'another' remote control unit wasn't needed at all. You get a heavy box and a power cord which is all you need except the sound cable and different setups will require different cables.. A subwoofer can always "blow out" so buying a several year insurance policy is a fantastic idea!!! After 3 days of ownership I'm a very happy camper.
5,Great for indoor home theatre to rattle the house a little
3,The Bass quality wasn't really what I was looking for . Nice subwoofers overall but I wanted heart pounding Bass. And I didn't deliver.
3,Muddy bass
5,I am very pleased with this product!  I've owned Polk Audio speakers in the past and have ALWAYS been extremely satisfied.  This sub is paired with powered bookshelf speakers primarily for music enjoyment but also for television audio. This sub packs such a big punch I had to place two pillows underneath to keep my windows and walls from vibration. Wonderfully clean and pure bass !!
5,This is my first subwoofer and I regret not getting one sooner. This speaker fills in the low range that I've never been able to hear in music because I never had speakers that could deliver frequencies this low.  With music you'll hear bass that you didn't even know was in the song -- and when used for a home theater you'll get deep hits in explosions and gunfire that you probably weren't hearing before.The speaker box is a little larger than I expected (which is fine because you need a full size box to get this kind of bass) but make sure you have room for it.The connections offer multiple solutions whether you're powering the speaker from elsewhere or using the onboard amp. It has a nice "auto" power feature which is REALLY good because it turns on when it senses audio and turns off after 15 minutes when audio stops.I paired this subwoofer with my Edifier R1850DB Active Bookshelf Speakers and it works perfectly with those speakers. The sound is rich and full and I just wish I didn't wait to order these.The volume of this subwoofer is fine for any house. I would only warn against use in an apartment because low frequencies travel right through walls!  This is a very real subwoofer in that regard.  It's just excellent and I can't believe the price for this quality especially being a self-powered speaker. No regrets.
5,I’ve had this sub for almost 4 years and I’m still impressed.First it spiced up my 2.1 system then I moved it down into my new 5.1 home theater where it shook the walls so much that I moved it back upstairs to a bigger room!Best $130 I ever spent.
5,I was in need to replace an old Sony Subwoofer. After so much research i went ahead with ordering this model mainly for the price deal Amazon had on it and did not want to break the bank. I initially wanted to get Klipsch but....I do have other Polk speakers being used as center and front heights and so its makes sense sticking with the same brand. It is very true; PolkAudio knows how to make great speakers. Trust the brand.My impressions as followed:1. Built Quality - Very good looking Sub2. Enough power to feel the walls shacking.3. Sub sound has a nice Deep tone. Does not disappoint4. Price - there is no brand name to match this. ***Period***I plugged only one rca to the white colored jack. it does LFE function just fine. Either connection will do as long as it is one cable subwoofer out from your receiver.If You have big room setup; i highly recommend to order 2 (If Your receiver has .2 sub channels) and call it a day. You do not need to buy $300 plus sub unless it really really is necessary.
5,For my purposes this is a nice subwoofer. I live in a townhouse with a living room of 11.5' X 19'. Produces more than enough bass for this size of space. If you need more bass you can turn it to face the wall. The base is clean and for a 10" sub pretty powerful. The bandpass and volume controls work as intended. It has left and right inputs but my receiver has a single subwoofer port. I connected straight into the left side port and it works just fine. If you want both ports driven you can always use a Y cable. So far it's been very durable I sometimes drive it pretty hard and it's never missed a beat no pun intended. I'm very happy with this subwoofer my neighbors probably don't like it as much as I do. The fit and finish are excellent especially for the price point. Recommended.
5,I'm very impressed with this sub. It's being used in a 20'x16' guestroom with an Onkyo receiver Sony SSB-3000s & an old 27" Sony XBR. Originally I expected to spend around $100 for an 8"...or even a 6.5...to add a little more "fullness" to the sound. So when I saw this sub for $69 my figuring was that I couldn't go wrong! And...so far...not a single regret!! I've got it hooked to the "B" speaker outputs enabling it to be used either to greatly enhance music or as a subtle solo support for the TV(too big of stereo sound for such a small screen is overkill!). It took some tweaking of all the components combined to find the desired sound along with the right balance for simply switching between the two but it's worth the effort. I really don't want guests to have to hassle with things like that.Now I'm not saying this sub doesn't have it's limitations 'cause if you plan on using it as your only low end source in something like a 1000 sq. foot room...this ain't the sub for you. But in a 'normal size' room you'll probably find this Polk to be much more than adequate. Watching Jurassic Park it does surprisingly well in reproducing those frequencies you can 'feel' but may not necessarily be able to 'hear' - if you know what I mean. And it can do this even at fairly low levels.When all is said & done one could easily spend $500 or more for another sub. But I believe the average person would likely find that the main advantages in doing this would turn out to be pretty much useless.
5,I ordered 2 of these because I had a Denon receiver with 2 sub outs. First world problem I know but I figured I might as well try it. I read an article on an A/V forum arguing that 2 lesser expensive woofers is better in a home theater than 1 single premium one because it will fill the room better and matter less where you're sitting for how you hear the bass response.Let me tell you I am blown away. I have one on either side in front near the L/R channels. They sound fantastic with games music and movies. My theater in a box sub this is replacing sounds terrible by comparison. I watched the Dark Knight and it is crazy how much more oomph guns cars and punches have with the better bass and music such as the Tron Legacy soundtrack or the theme from Planet Earth and the Inception soundtrack sound just incredible. Weapons firing and explosions in games such as Battlefield 1 will shake the walls if you want them to.I'm sure a single one of these would already be a huge upgrade over theater in a box subwoofers but with a pair they really shine. Highly recommended.
5,i would first off like to address some previous reviewers that have stated that they had a low humming or buzzing noise. i believe this was caused by these people not having a adequate subwoofer cable to shield against EMI and RFI. i have a very nice ATLONA subwoofer cable that is; double shielded has oxygen free copper conductor and 24k gold connectors. i have had no humm or buzz.here is my review of the polk audio psw10Pros:  low cost easy to install aesthetically pleasing(looks very nice) porting made from composite material that will last a long time auto shut off feature when not in use very good sound quality nice and crisp not "boomy" bass very good owners manual and customer support/service from polk audio.Cons:  Low wattage no cables included not down firing port and no low-frequency effect (LFE)support.conclusion:  I am very pleased with this subwoofer. It has a dynamic power rating of 100W but it sounds like more. the quality of the sound coming out is very good. I actually had to turn it down because it was so loud when i was first was setting it up and testing it( I have worked with Jet engines that require double hearing protection for years). I don't know how loud some people watch their TVs or movies but this is way more than loud enough.It shakes my house.  I really like the way this thing looks. this subwoofer also complements my sound bar very well.  I have; watched movies TV and  listened to music. all sound superb to me.I highly recommend if you buy any subwoofer  you buy a quality subwoofer cable.  I highly recommend buying this subwoofer if you are looking for a good value or "best bang for the buck".
5,I purchased this sub from Amazon over a year ago.  I use it for my computer system and usage is mostly listening to music and playing games.  I have it hooked up to a Denon AVR-E200 using a subwoofer cable the audio signal comes out of my PC graphics card over HDMI.  For the price this is a great subwoofer.  I find it a great value and so it is fully worth 5 stars.  For potential buyers I would only caution these two things:1.  If you have a large room you may find this sub inadequate.  I originally had it hooked up to my main home theater setup in a large room and it was not quite able to fill the space.  I ended up buying a 12" sub and moving this into a much smaller room for my PC setup.2.  The front face cover is connected to the main housing by six small posts.  3 of the 6 posts flat out broke off after a year of use which would cause a rattle when the bass was hitting hard.  No problem you can just remove it and not worry about the rattle.  I honestly don't know what concerns there may be with running the sub without that front face cover but so far so good.I have two Polk TL3 satellite speakers hooked up along with this sub.  They complement each other very nicely and make for a pleasing audio experience.
5,5.2 avr and music surround sound baby. listen to those helos overhead!
5,This is a very good subwoofer in my opinion! I purchased this sub to accompany my two JBL arena speakers and my Polk audio CS10 center channel speaker not to mention also my JBL Leviton surrounds as well! This sub compliments them very well with a bass punch that moves my sofa with the right setting!!! I purchased this sub because of the many positive reviews and I am very impressed with this sub in spite of some of the negative reviews by mostly “audiofools” because it’s not good enough for them! Trust me folks for the average person with entry level equipment this sub hits home! No regrets! Is this the best subwoofer out there? Of course not! For $129 what do you expect? As far as I’m concerned this thing provides enough bass for my music and movies and is strong enough to get my wife “Sandra” to come charging down the stairs telling me to “Please turn it down.”😁😁😁
4,This is a great little sub; not because it reproduces the lowest lows or because it rattles the neighbors windows or the fact that its is very affordable ( purchased on sale here for $80 ). None of these things are solely the reason i love this purchase it is the fact  that Polk really struck a fine balance of all these things. For music and video alike it fills in the low frequencies that small satalite speakers simply can't provide. And it does so with enough volume to compliment a moderately powered system. The 50 Watts rating on this thing is very deceptive to the output it actually produces. i have it paired to a pair of 5" satalite speakers being run off a audiosource 50w/CH amp and this sub has power to spare. i have it crossed over around 80-90 Hz and it blends nicely. the bass is tight and controlled in its sweet range. dip a bit lower than 35Hz and it does tend to lose control a bit. i am seriously thinking of purchasing a 30 hz high pass filter to eliminate the really low frequencies from my system all together. I use the system to watch TV or listen to music while working out in my ufinished basement which is a large area and it does fine and blended well with the satalite speakers. i would recomend this system to anyone on a budjet wanted to fill end the low end on a budget system. it is not high end but it is a great main stream product for a budget price. would put it up against anything in the 100-150 range
5,Works great. Gives me some boom boom behind the wall
5,This review will be based on price/performance. Many "audiophiles" do not like this sub but its an $80 speaker for a reason.How I set it up:Set the subwoofers cross over all the way up and hooked it up using a y-cable (tried single into left and right but the Y made it a little louder). Set the cross over on my stereo (Pioneer VSX-521-K) to 80Hz. Adjusted the volume to about half (fills my 17' x 20' Living/Dining Room combo nicely). Never heard it distort at this level and seems to blend nicely with my tower speakers.Pros:Inexpensive - not cheap because this thing looks and feels nicely builtGood Sound for both movies and music - after the initial break in period. The bass was non-existent at lower volumes before it broke in. Now it hit nicely no matter what the volume is.Great for apartment living - not overly powerful so it will satisfy the bass craving while not getting you in trouble with your neighborsCons:Does have "muddy" bass at times - a few people mention it being too loud at times and I agree. There are times when this thing seems to be louder than it should but not often enough for it to bother me. When it does seem louder it does produce "muddy" bass.Auto Sleep function happens too quickly - wish this thing didn't auto-shut off when watching a TV showIf you are on a tight budget like I was this is a great choice. It is worth all of the $80 I paid for it and I may consider a second one in the future.
5,I have a professional karaoke set up in my living room as we used to host karaoke.  I play off my laptop into two EV 100 speakers.  The sound was OK but need more bass. Since it is only in my living room I did not want to spent a lot.  However all the lower priced subwoofers had  RCA inputs.  When I used to do karaoke I had my large bass unit hooked to the speaker.  In order to use the output from the lap top I would have to use a splitter and worried that would not work well.  The speakers have no RCA output.  The output is one with three holes which I don't know what it is called.  I purchased a cable that plugged into the speaker output with an RCA male on the other end which I plugged into the left RCA input on the subwoofer.It worked perfect and gives perfect sound.  I am VERY happy with the purchase.  I cannot figure out what the higher priced units have that could be better.
5,Works as advertised. Great for Dolby atmos I b the bedroom
4,Read this this is a complete and honest review of this sub and its pros and cons:I payed 80$ new for this sub when Amazon was having a sale about 6 months ago.Now about the sub; Build quality is good just like you'd expect from polk. Not very heavy so it's easy to move from place to place if needed with minimal effort.Now something I should mention. I do not use this sub for movies and as a home theatre unit. I am a music producer so I use this sub with my studio monitors just to get a clearer view of my low end when mixing and this sub is absolutely excellent with that. The lows are very deep and precise which is just what I need.On the other hand the sub is not very powerful. It sure feels like more than 50 watts but really not much more. Let's say that it's not made to be very loud. With a pair of 8" studio monitors the sub doesn't have to be turned up very loud but I could only imagine that in a home theatre setup this sub would struggle a bit.So quality is good at low volume but really isn't meant for much more than that. Also something very annoying about this sub is that when you do turn the volume up the port noise begins to really bother you. Polk clearly didn't make the port large enough as the noise it makes comes in way before the sub itself begins to distort.But for me paying 80$ I really couldn't have expected any better.
5,Worth the money
5,I didn't pull the trigger on buying this rift away and I wish I had. This Sub delivers some of the deepest bass that I wouldn't expect. I caught myself saying "damn" l quite a few times. Definitely worth the buy!
3,Could have been an excellent value.Internals rattle and buzz.  I suspect that the cabinet material is the wrong density or thickness.The little hard plastic feet are a focking insulting joke ...  Cabinet rattles buzzes and bounces on a hardwood floor.The power and electronics seem fine and would be a good value.The design engineer/product manager should be publicly ridiculed and required to put their name and contact info on the box!I put some appropriate feet on it and set a kettle bell (on a little rubber pad) on top.  Resolved/hid the issues mostly ... satisfied enough not to go to trouble of returning.  If I ever get bored enough I may take it apart to address the internals.For couple of bucks to the purchase price they could have selected better feet and mdf ... a little hot glue.  It would be an excellent value!
5,For a long time I didn't have a sub in my modest Yamaha surround system the Polk towers I have handle bass really well.  Then my friend gave me an old Pioneer sub he probably got at a garage sale.  It made a big difference even though it wasn't exactly matched to my system.  Recently it developed an annoying rattle and I thought wow that has to go.  What to replace it with?  Polk Audio has a great reputation and are my favorite speakers due to their clean uncolored sound.  As I read the reviews I wondered if the PSW10 could live up to that reputation.  I'm happy to say that it does!  Just like my Polk towers the PSW10 does not artificially color sound it won't produce bass unless it's in the source material so at times I forget it's even there. if there is a movie explosion deep bass note or whatever it's there doing the job and doing it well!  I was a little put off by other reviews that said they detected a pumping rushing air sound from the front portal.  I can't detect any unnatural sound and I'm very happy with my purchase.  If you like paying top dollar for bragging rights this sub isn't for you but if you want good sound at a very modest price I believe you'll be pleased.
4,bass sounds manufactured and not natural or real.
5,Greta addition to our surround sound.  Adds depth and improves our sports and movie watching experience.  Easy to set up.  Connected to receiver without any issues.
5,This was to replace a 12" 300w Cambridge Soundworks unit that finally died after 20 yrs.  I had been using my stereo for a year or two without it after thinking I'd try to replace the electronics in the old unit and didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a new Klipsch or other higher quality brand to replace it.  On a recommendation of a friend I dropped $99 on this guy during a sale... It's actually a bit punchier and less 'droney' than my older 12" unit.  It blasts explosions and deep funk bass as loud as I want indoors!  I could see how you might want something with more wattage for an outdoor setting.  I'm perfectly happy with this purchase don't think I would have been anymore satisfied paying for a $300+ replacement.
5,Thanks to the RCA Stereo Inputs at this Polk sub  I was able to connect my MacBook with an Audio Splitter cable to both my Presonus speakers RCA stereo line ins (the Presonus have no sub out) and the RCA stereo line ins of this Polk sub. I play keyboards thru my VST synths from my Macbook VST synths libraries plus adding music from my iTunes library as a kinda playing along. The Polk delivers exactly the portion of deep rich and full frequencies aka bass which adds a respectable value to my music playing. Having added this sub means that drum and bass lines got fresh and clearly audible in a truly beautiful manner by tweaking the low pass and volume knobs until the desired sweet spot sound is achieved. Now my playing of Pink Floyd tunes like "Shine on you crazy diamond " or "One of these days" (one of the best bass lines ever) gets to the level where I dare to say "outstanding performance". My studio transforms to a broad stage fantastic! Friends and wife love it I do too. No mixer needed no $$$$ speaker-sub setup needed how cool is that?
5,The 1st one we bought had a buzz but the replacement was great works like it should.Amazon replaced with not trouble at all.
5,Excellent bass for a small or medium size room.No regrets! Totally pleased with polk purchases.
4,First off for under $150 this is one heck of a deal. The bass is strong punchy and fills up my 15x20 open room with 12 foot ceilings nicely. As long as you place this subwoofer appropriately and adjust the volume(less is better) to match your speakers I'm confident that you'll like what you hear.  I have this at less than 1/4 volume so there is tons of bass to spare.I gave this 4 stars because the auto on/off feature requires more volume than I'd like to kick in. It's really only an issue when listening at quieter volumes and I've gotten used to it. At louder volumes it kicks on with no problem and sadly I don't get to crank my system enough. Unless you're an audiophile you can't go wrong with this subwoofer for small to medium spaces.
3,I am not going to give this subwoofer one star because I know for most it will be capable of pleasing you. For me this sub is very cheap in low note production. The power it puts out is weak but not non-existant.When I had it it was decent for movies but by no means good. It simply gives its user bass not good bass.The bass is inaccurate at times and wimpy sounding (as mentioned above). The subwoofer does not hit the lows at very well either. It will just cut them off there is no slow roll off but that is expected with a ported sub.Turn the volume past half on these and you are begging for trouble. With the gain (volume) that high the amp installed on it will start to clip and will ruin your sub. The bass becomes louder of course but extremely loud even more inaccurate and boomy. For those familiar with Kicker car audio it will sound like a low level Kicker Comp with a cheap amp at high volumes.If you want to use these for music look elsewhere quickly! They will leave you disappointed IF you are more than an average listener like me and I am by no means an audiophile.After a week I returned these exactly how I got them. On here I paid $108 shipped to Texas with tax. When Amazon got it back the charged me $28 for the free super save shipping so I only got $80 back. That made me sick since I paid $30 to pretty much test these for a week. Consequently I did two weeks of research so that I would be sure my next setup would not leave me disappointed again. I looked at reviews on the Polk PSW505 and BIC F12 to prepare for another set that would be sued for 70% movies and 30% music. I could not commit to either or do to various known issues on both of those powered subs.So in the end I got a ported sub box made to about 2.5 cube. It was tuned to 29hz and had a cutout on the back for a plate amp. I got it finished in black carpet because I wanted it to look good without spending a fortune to get it painted cherry or something. Again for those familiar with car audio you know the normal black carpet used in mobile sub box installs.I then got a digital 500w Bash plate amplifier from Parts Express and paired it with a 15" Polk Audio MM SVC subwoofer capable of handling 420 watts nominal (RMS).TALK ABOUT LOWS! The new setup is an SQ guys/gals dream! It digs deep gets loud and still sounds good. It is also very accurate and not boomy at all despite being ported. Total a setup like mine will run $550 but it is far more worth it than two PSW505 or F12s.
4,Talk about surprised! I pick this up just to have a little more low end to go with my KRK monitors. At the cost of this 10” I really wasn’t expecting much. I figured I’d give it a shot. And upon first track I was shocked at the kick this thing has.Don’t get me wrong it’s no krk sub nor anything like the back of my truck. It’s no Bose that’s for sure. So it can only handle so much volume.However for the price brand new and for a small studio set up at home it more than get the job done! You won’t need to crank the out put to max. It’s pretty damn loud at mid range and even at times overpowering if your levels are not set.Worth the change if you have it. Probably could find it for half or less used. But it’s not a bank breaker to just grab new!
5,I got this to connect to my Edifier bookshelf speakers and it did not disappoint. The frequency range is fantastic and the sound is buttery and warm no static or distortion (running an Echo Dot through the Edifiers so we're not talking wicked Hi-Fi here either).My only quarrel with this unit is the fact it's the size of an end table. Shame on me for not reading the product dimensions twice (measure twice sub once). So it got relocated from the family room and is much more at home in my mancave hooked up to a fine audiophile-worthy receiver setup.But for the price point the quality is unsurpassed. Just know it's a beast.
5,Great sub for already Polk systems and not ungodly outrageous expensive like Klipsch which is like Apple fanboy based!
5,What a great subwoofer!!!  I had a passive subwoofer that came with the Samsung theater system I had bought.  After my wife bought a new Jeep with a subwoofer in the infotainment system I needed an upgrade in my Ford Edge.  I had a powered subwoofer put in the car.  Well the house needed an upgrade.  In searching for powered subwoofers on Amazon.com I found this at a great price and bought it.  The instructions are written in about a thousand languages.  That was the most difficult part in setting it up though.  I already had a subwoofer out from the theater console which ended in two wires.  I bought a dual RCA plug with a mini audio plug on the end which I was going to connect to the two wires and connect to the subwoofer but found just clipping them into the speaker input jacks was sufficient.  I was up and running in less than 5 minutes.  It took several music samples and a couple of movies to adjust the volume so that I had the deep base sound I wanted without them boom and rattling of the windows.  I think the lighter wood finish would have looked more rich looking in out house but the black is what I ordered to match the existing speakers and TV.  I can see adapting this with another subwoofer for the back (probably the old passive one) to enhance the surround sound.
5,I won't get into detail with specs since other reviewers have that covered. I'll just comment on the audio quality. For the size of this sub woofer it produces good sound which will easily fill small to medium sized rooms (I would guess up to 20X20). It can get a bit "thumpy" sometimes so you'll probably need to adjust the bass levels with the rear knob when switching from music to movies once in awhile.This sub-woofer will not hit the lowest of frequencies but for its price you can't expect it to perform like a $1000 sub-woofer. I think it out-performs similar speakers in its class however. Perfect for your average home theater or music listening pleasure. If you want a richer sounding bass for a high quality movie theater setup I would suggest going bigger.**Update**2 years later my subwoofer is still running like the first day I got it. I have been so impressed with it I purchased another one to run a dual sub setup for my home theater. Everything sounds AMAZING! I can run each unit at a lower power in a paired configuration than a single unit running alone which eliminates any unwanted "thumping" while keeping a deep rich sound that fills the entire room evenly.Seriously one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon!
5,Sounds like it should cost 500$.
5,I waited and stalked the prices on Amazon for several months. I was weary about spending so little on this unit however it was well worth the wait and research. Although there are bigger fancier and others that offer more customization I am perfectly content with this woofer. Although it lacks an LFE input (as the PSW12 has) it does not bother me as the PSW10 is $100 + cheaper. My reasoning is such: The value vs sound quality is tremendous despite lacking this feature. This blows any "affordable" woofer out of the water. (literally)  in addition one is able to connect other woofers as desired using the convenient connections provided so if you're on a budget (like the college student I am) you will be able to purchase the 12" at a later date and have an even more surreal experience. For now my crack den apartment is filled perfectly with bass especially for such a small space. The neighbors love it trust me.If you're debating between models as I was yes the quality is wonderful despite the ridiculously low price. My only advice read the instructions and BUY EXCELLENT WOOFER CABLES. (Do NOT buy the amazon basics one the shield on it is the WORST and will sound awful if it works at all).Also Polk Audio master race.
5,Well i like to actually hear the full range of music and movies... so I saw this on black friday deal and had to get it.  The only con is that I had to buy a Toslink to Analog RCA out so that I can connect it to my LG TV... i wish it had that built in however the Digital to Analog converter has a remote and volume control so I can adjust the bass separate from the TV volume (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LF82S95/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).Other than that it works just as expected.  My favorite thing about it that now i can watch bass boosted dank memes and enjoy it as it was meant to be heard in ear rape mode... and watch the look on my wife's face as she thinks a plane is crashing into the side of the house.  It is just a wonderful device... I might get a second one to give it a full surround sound house exploding submersion effect.
5,Great bass response. Way more bass than I need. See photo for my settings. Great value for price.
4,I am a very critical buyer and I'm CHEAP to. So I did alot of research about Powered Subwoofers and looked at alot of reviews from other websites. My reciever is an older TEAC Dolby Pro-Logic one' so I don't have a  SUB-OUT option. I have a 48" HD LED Smart TV. My 5 speakers are average for the highs and I felt there was something lacking in the sound when it came to low frequencies. (of coarse). I know I need a updated reciever but they were expensive. I found this sub did some research it had a reasonable price so I bought it. I needed a powered one due to the older reciever. I hooked up the front speaker wire Inputs on the sub and ran the outputs on the sub to my speakers in the Front plugged it in and turned it all on. After a little tweeking the low frequencies sounded great. To watch a movie on any cable station and feel the cannons and music made so much difference in the sound. This was the best decision I have made on a personal purchase ever. I LOVE IT ! And I keep the power dial on the back below the half mark and I feel the sound and it fills the room so very well. I bet if I hook this up to an updated reciever that the sound will be even better. If your looking for a great sub for an average size room and dont want to spend a whole paycheck to do it then buy this.
5,I used to have a much larger entertainment area at a previous house with a 12" JBL that was very good deep and booming.  Moved to a house with a much smaller viewing/listening area so I downgraded due to space.  For the price is the key here no it is not my 12" JBL no its not a $350 Klipsch but for $129 I can't say a bad thing about it. Nice punch deep enough frequency range and it doesn't take up a huge area.  Volume control works well frequency controls work well.  You would need to spend at least 100 more to beat it.  There are some good review videos out on the internet that pointed me to this sub.
3,Cable wasn’t the right style cable. Had to purchase an additional adapter to connect subwoofer to my Denon Amplifier…
4,Auto power on doesn't always power on with music does not have a MONO sub input
5,Ok here goes. I'm a bit of an audio fanatic looking for things that sound good and produce notes across the listening spectrum well. These are definitely budget speakers by price but sound much greater than the tag shows. At ten inches you won't get the massively deep rumble and mind-blowing bass but you will get a solid low end enhancement. I have two of these installed side by side and for a larger room that provides the perfect amount of bass. In the larger room just one of them didn't seem to get to the far edges. That said for a small room you'd be perfectly good with this handling your low end. I have this in a 5.2 system two floor standers with two 5 inch drivers a center and two bookshelf speakers in the rear. It handles jazz rock techno acoustic classical all quite well and the subs are what drive the music performance to our delight. The two subs side by side pair extremely well together and augment the system considerably. Good audio doesn't have to cost thousands and here's proof. Don't get me wrong I can appreciate the high end stuff and it sounds phenomenal  but if you're after a good set of speakers Polk is a great place to start for anyone and finish for most.
5,I need more popcorn this sub makes my home theatre come alive.
5,This has an amazing number of reviews. I had a Bose speaker and subwoofer set on my computer for years now. I love it to the point where I won't listen to anything on the computer without speakers plugged in. I always planned to get a subwoofer for my living eventually but hesitated because I didn't want to be that guy who is always disturbing his neighbors lol.I finally took the plunge I with the Polk and I love it. You can hear the difference instantly. I watched a Call of duty video on youtube and the shots came alive. Volume is very controllable so you won't harass your neighbors unless you want to. After buying the Polk I started to understand why someone would by two sub to enhance bass quality even more.Audiofile wise my ears aren't actually that sophisticated. For most people this Polk sub is all you will ever need. At this price point why not :) go head and buy 1. This is a great way to get your feet wet on subwoofer sound.
5,I consider my self an  audiophile after many years of critical listening to many different audio gear. I believe I have as a result deveolped a discerning ear. I no longer pay too much attention to technical specs. A piece of gear has to sound "musical" period. This sub is excellent in reproducing  solid accurate (flat) non boomy bass that gives acoustic bass instruments (my go to recordings to judge bass accuracy and realism.)I own another sub 6 x the price of this sub by another reputable manufacturer in my home theater set up and the Polk holds it's own musically. Definitely worth a listen in anyone's system.
5,Works great for an entry level sub.  Could be better but for what you pay for its superb.
5,I purchased this subwoofer for my sony str-dn1010 7.1 receiver. First of all I had an all in one sony theater system before which sounded pretty good already. I had a little bit of extra money so I wanted to experiment with a better system so I bought the new sony receiver 2 sony towers and I already had 2 sony bookshelfs that i hooked up to it. I wanted to hook my old all in one subwoofer to the receiver but I found out it wouldnt work. So I had to buy a powered subwoofer to compliment my new sony receiver. So I started looking online and I narrowed my chooses to sony and polk so I took the chance with the polk it just looked better in my opinion. I dont know what the sony subwoofer sounds like but I know that this polk subwoofer sounds great. First of all the bass is to much if u turn the volume on the back all the way up. I have mine up half way otherwise it overpowers your music and movies its that powerful. That being said if you want a subwoofer that delivers powerful deep bass then look no further because you wont be disappointed. If I turn it up 3/4 of the way its to much and I think thats what most people want is enough bass when u want it and if you get the urge to really shake your walls then turn it up all the way and it will. If your looking for a powerful subwoofer I definitely would recommend this because its powerful and not expensive either.
5,I was hesitant to buy this sub because of the negative reviews. Well I took a chance and purchased one. The base was excellent. Because of the size and room layout I knew I was going to need two. The base was so good with one I almost didn't buy the second one. Well I did buy one more and wow such great clean base. I also liked the fact that these subs have front facing ports. One pleasant surprise my old definitive technology that died would walk all over my hard wood floor. Not the Polks they  crank out deep base and don't move an inch. Music and movies sound great. For the money these are hard to beat.
5,I was looking for a Subwoofer to go with my in-wall surround sound set up. I have 4 in-ceiling and 1 center channel in-wall connected to my Pioneer receiver. The set up isn't at pro level but definitely better than basic speaker surround set up though. Based on my search I ended up considering 2 subs. Polk PSW10 (10") and Monoprice 9723 (12"). Monoprice was only $27 more and had very good review on many sites. But it was on back order. And I didn't want to wait. Polk PSW10 was available and the most reviewed sub on Amazon. Review dated back to 2005 and after over 2500 reviews it still was one of the highest ratedsub. So I thought all these people can't be doing something wrong for this long. So I ordered Polk PSW10 for $100.Installation was a bit tricky cause it only has AV in and my receiver has LFE out. Using speaker channel lines wasn't an option. Luckily I found a splitter and hooked it up. Once the receiver was set the sound finally came out. Wow.For a medium size room and with 8" surround speakers the sub sounded awesome. It didn't blow me away but it definitely have decent thump. After adjusting it to match my speakers the set up sounded great.This subwoofer is a classic and you can't go wrong with a classic.
4,I have a vintage system with a pair of wharfedale Dovedale 3 speakers. These have 10” woofers with paper cones. At 50 years old I thought I would insert a sub woofer a year ago to take the pressure off. Unfortunately the sub woofer cone seems to be breaking down? Playing dark side of the moon it rattles noticeably. My old wharfedale woofers are fine good as new. Any body else had problems?
5,Awesome subwoofer. Buy it.
5,I am very impressed with the quality of the sound the volume the ability to control both the volume and crossover frequency. I struggled with getting the unit to work for almost two weeks and finally bought a better grade cable. That was it. The first cable I bought had an RCA connector that felt loose. I think that was the problem. As soon as i installed a better cable with a tight fitting RCA connector the subwoofer came to life! And it made the sound so full rich and just great!. I can't believe the price. I will update with a follow-up review after some time passes. But right now I love this unit.
4,I only give this 4 stars because of the description.  Amazon suggests that you buy a sub cable.  this is true if your receiver has a single sub out.  What the description does not say is that this sub only has a L & R RCA input.  you will need a 2 male to 1 female Y adaptor.  I wish the pictures would have showed the back of the sub.  there are 2 banks of inputs for you to power your speakers through if you wish to run them that way also.  This sub sounds great and has a huge range of power.  you can select the crossover level on 1 dial and the volume of the sub on another.  again this is a 5 star sub for the price as well as the performance.  I did my research and compared it to the PSW108 by Polk audio.  for the life of me I do not see a difference other than $100 price tag.  when you look at the specs on the polk site they are identical.  If you have a small to mid size room this sub will more than fill your needs.  I am using this for only music at the moment and not in a surround sound system so results may vary.  I'm very happy I made this purchase.
5,I have had a pair of Polk 4a speakers since 1982.  I make my living as a musician and have a lot of gear ( and run AR9's for the tv rolm and Mackie 824's with 12" sub in my studio) and my living room system and vinyl collection needed an upgrade.  Liking the Polk products I pulled the trigger on this little sub and it has been the best money I have spent! How I got along all these years without one I have no idea why!  This little guy gives a nice tight depth that I was missing and the best part is I dont have to crank it up to enjoy it- I love the volumn knob and can simply dial to taste based on the recording at the moment.  I bought one for my daughter and will soon be buying another for one of my other daughters-  its that good!  Christmas is coming- treat yourself!
5,Great buy.
5,I was going to get a gaming sound setup then saw this powered sub. I hadn't considered powered subs because usually they are quite pricey. However Polk has been around forever and I had used their products before. This sub is SO LOUD it's amazing you can get this type of sound for just over $100. If considering a sub on a budget THIS IS THE ONE!  The only possible downside I could find was the very low end frequency response below 40 hz.  It's a 10" not a 12" however so you kind of expect that.
5,This sub is amazing! I was running my bass of the 15 inch Technics floorstanders I have but this sub just thumps. During the Audyssey setup I had to turn it down! Of course I turned it back up around halfway.Placement is in the corner of a 10 by 15 foot room. There is ample bass for all of our needs it rattles the windows and wall hanging pictures. I was nervous about it only going down to 40 Hz but after 1 movie with this I am not worried at all.To note I have a single subwoofer cable running to the inputs and have had zero issues. I leave it on standby and it turns on as needed. Great sub!
5,Room size: 20x20Recently added another PSW10 to my system and the difference is day and night. I placed the second sub 20ft away across the room. That's how you kill all the dead spots feel that well balanced kick and more importantly you don't have to push your single sub to the limit which will make your movie or music sound nasty.My recommendation is to have two PSW10 instead of one sub (regardless of the size and price). No matter how much cash you drop on a single sub you'll have dead spot issues. With having two specially front left rear right setup you'll split the power between two subs and won't notice where the bass is coming from. That's the key!PSW10 is definitely the best sub money can buy for that price with a beautiful design.
5,Nothing to dislike. Nice looking and a great sound!
4,While I was looking for a comparative sub-woofer I was comparing PSW30 and PSW452 and PSW10. PSW452 sounds better but for the price $110 vs $325 vs $250 at BestBuy I decided for PSW10. The cashier dropped the price for me even though they still sell PSW10 for $200 here idk why but hey who cares right party in my wallet yes it is. Those of you who worry about no LFE input that shouldn't be a problem like really that's your worry. All you have to do is connect the sub-woofer output of the receiver to the right input on the sub-woofer it's super simple just do it. And then set the variable low pass filter on the sub-woofer to the highest setting or lowest setting for those of my bump and grind bass lovers. This will set a filter that gives an LFE input. But you can always use a RCA cable to provide a connection to both inputs on the sub machine to and from the receiver. Then adjust frequency from the woofer for you type of music. It sounds a little deeper and kocks harder making my neighbors knock on my door when I'm getting it on. I bought a monster cable and it sounds way better than RCA cable whoever says it doesn't is lying to you it's crisp. Try to buy this my fellow enthusiasts.
5,I am sure there are even better products out there. For my needs however I found this to be a great value for the money.
5,Small living room works fine. I use it more for the tv than I do for music. Explosions go BOOM better space ships rumble deeper. Good cheap subwoofer.
4,Ordered this sub woofer to compliment a pair of Polk TSI100's (Bookshelf speakers). Running the sub through my Onkyo receiver.The Good:Nice responsive bass.The sub handles all but the lowest bass very well. I listen to a very broad range of music from experimental hip hop rock black metal folk punk classics etc...I have the speaker in my 12 X 18 front room and it fills the room (and most of our two bedroom) with bass.Has a nice auto off feature which disables power from the sub when no signal is detected for 30 min. Upon receiving a single the sub starts back up automatically.The bad:The form factor is large. You will need to designate a good 2ft. cube of space for this sub.The cabinet is MDF board instead of wood.For some reason Polk has listed the twin of the sub in cherry finish at a far higher price. I ordered the TSI 100's in cherry and would have loved to have had a matching cherry set but I could not justify the extra for the finish alone. I thought perhaps it was because the cherry speakers were hardwood but alas no such luck there. The black does look nice however it has a pleasant wood grain facade.Verdict: 4 out 5For the price this is a solid choice for a hi-fi setup or home theater.
5,I wanted to reduce the clutter my speakers imposed in our living room. I have a very excellent subwoofer that I paid about $600 for but I wanted to hide the subwoofer in the wall where I had the depth.  Unfortunately the sub I had used a downward firing woofer with a rear port - not gonna work.  For $100 I thought I would take a chance after seeing the strong ratings and seeing that some reviewers were serious audio lovers and not just using it for TV. This unit was used in exactly the same setup as my older sub and I could not tell any difference.  Very tight and fast which is what I look for not "boom-boom".  Because the Polk is 1) small and 2) both the woofer and the port are on the face it met my criteria.  Last night I cut the hole in my wall (after much anxiety) and also took the opportunity to run my speaker wires in the wall (about 2 ft of space in this wall due to a built in fireplace). I spray painted the front black to make it less intrusive (I hate silver - hence the 4-stars for appearance). I will need to make a custom grill cover but acoustically it sounds the same. WAF just went up a couple points for sure.  Buy this and a pair of Ascend Acoustics CBM-170 SE's and you will have a phenomenal system for under $500.[...]You will here guitar and piano to make you cry. I don't know how Polk can make any money on these unless it is on volume. I am sure they must sell a bunch 'cuz it's that good.
4,First one smoked 31 days after purchase literally had smoke come out. We had a large family gathering coming up so my wife just decided to buy a new one after customer service jerked me around a bit.
4,I've got this in the corner of my living room supplementing the low end of my audio-only set up.  I'm using multiple Chromecast Audio devices set up in a group to stream music to this subwoofer plus two other sets of smaller bookshelf sized speakers.  The combination is very nice.If you're a real audiophile you may be disappointed in the clarity of the bass.  I can hear and recognize the difference between a high quality audio set up and a cheap "just get the job done" set up.  This sub falls somewhere in between...which was fine for my purposes in this room right now.  It will give you the low end you seek but it's not as tight as my dual 8" Mirage subwoofer.  (Granted the Mirage cost considerably more.)Pros:  Excellent value for the price.  Strong low-end output.  Built-in low-pass active crossover to allow only low end to the amplifier / sub.  (crossover is variable from 80 Hz to 160 Hz)Cons:  The sound is a bit muddy and not as crisp as you would find in a more expensive model.Conclusion:  Good enough for my purposes right now.  Given the feature set and the price I would likely buy this again.
5,I was looking for a sub to connect to my Sonos 120 and go along with a pair of Gallo a'Diva Ti Globe Speakers.  I wanted to cross the speakers over through the sub to get max mid-range and highs from my small globe speakers and not make them do any work with bass.  I have the set-up in my office where I do not need deep bass will not be watching movies-but only listening to music at reasonably moderate volumes.  I just wanted some depth.At the time this sub was less than $100 delivered which is an unbelievable value for a quality name subwoofer.  It has the ability to cross your speakers over and choose the volume of the sub as well as the tolerance levels.  I keep it under my desk so it can't be seen and it's not huge.  The depth that it has added to my Gallo speakers has been perfect.  This sub is capable of so much more than what I am using it for but it is good to know that as things change in my audio set-up-which they always do-I will have a very capable performer at the ready.The bass is a bit "Boomy" vs. tight-a quality I think is typical of a lower end sub-but if you are on a budget or looking to  just to provide some basic depth to your music or movies-I cannot imagine anything being a better value than this.  As a matter of fact I am thinking of getting a 2nd one for the bedroom to hook up to my Sonos 120 there.
5,The PSW10 is my first powered sub for a home theater and I'm loving this subwoofer. (Granted I've only been running it for about a month.) I was running a cheap 5.1 RCA home theater setup before but moving into a new house required a new home theater setup...at least that's what I told my wife. I am currently running the sub on a new Sony STR-DH770 receiver with the cheap RCA surround sound speakers. As soon as I have some free time my next step will be installing ceiling speakers but even with what I'm using now the sub sounds great. With our current setup we only need to keep the sub's volume between 1-2. When I first set it up we tried turning the volume up and the speaker was powerful enough to shake everything in our 1300 sq. ft. house. I wouldn't consider myself a true audiophile but I've worked my way up from the really cheap home theater equipment and I've lived in a house with someone that spent $10000+ on his Klipsch theater system. In my humble opinion the PSW10 sub sounds great for only spending $100 on a subwoofer.I will try to remember to do an update after about a year of use.
4,In my small space I opted for Monitors all the way around including the   Polk Audio Monitor Series CS1 Center Channel Speaker (Single Black)          Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer (Single Black)         and two sets of   Polk Audio Monitor 40 2-Way Bookshelf Speakers (Pair Black)        .  Most of the time I don't have the opportunity to really crank this sub and thankfully I don't need to.  Even with the gain turned pretty far down it offers deep shaking lows.  Mine is placed off the floor on a box to insulate the neighbors and they have never complained.  I wish it used a digital coax instead of left/right channel RCA connectors and some of the settings don't seem to make a difference in my space.  It does have an automatic setting that turns the woofer on when you need it and keeps it off when the show or movie don't require it but I've noticed that it stays on and continues to hum a little after I turn the receiver off for up to an hour.  I just keep it within arms reach and flip the switch to off then back to auto but it is a bit frustrating because sometimes I forget and that just means a higher electric bill.  Attractive and easy to hide if needed a great value when used in a smaller space or multi-use room in an apartment/townhouse or if you just want good sound out of a small to medium sized package.  These have always been good quality speakers and Polk has done a good job updating the look and staying competitive.
5,Sound is great!
3,If you just need something to watch movie this is fine. But for music you probably want something better. At 50% volume (a recommended level by both Polk and AVSforum) I don't even feel the vibration from the subwoofer even with heavy bass is playing. The bass sound from the Polk front speaker that I got as a combo is louder than this subwoofer. Return this and got a Klipsch for about $30 more and that is a big different. I did not expect this to be super strong since it is the cheapest subwoofer out there but a subwoofer that does not make sound for music is no use to me.
3,Considering the price of 90 bucks I'd say this is a pretty decent sub for casual listening. I live in an apartment so I really didn't want something too powerful. So my review will reflect low to mid volume usage. I haven't tried high volume. The box feels very nice too. Far better than I expected from a (forgive the pun) sub-100 dollar subwoofer.I have a few gripes with the PSW10:1) It's not magnetically shielded. Being that I'm using it for a computer and have a lot of networking and computer equipment around I have to be extra careful with placement.2) It's got pretty nasty port noise at medium volumes. I don't notice the port noise at low volumes with the cover on the front on carpet while mid/high tones are playing from the Mackie CR4s I have in front of and closer to me. But when I was setting up the sub and running some frequency tests the port noise was significant enough to shatter my initial great impression. Even in the budget range a sub should not produce this much port noise at low to medium volumes.3) The low pass filter doesn't go quite as low as I'd like. There's a bit more overlap between the Mackie CR4s and the PSW10 than I'd prefer. Even turning the low pass filter down to 80hz still produces a significant amount of sound in higher frequencies.If you're just looking for something to add some low tones to a sound system for cheap this sub is decent. If you're an audiophile you probably already know this is absolutely not going to produce sound of a high enough quality (nor is anything in this price range I'm sure). I have mixed feelings about this purchase. But when I consider that I only paid 90 dollars I can say I'm comfortable with it. Should it ever fail I will definitely be looking at better quality subs.
5,I purchased this item 4 years ago and it has worked non stop with out any problems with our surround sound day in and day out.  I have never heard any crackles or other feedback while playing video games watching TV or any movie (blue ray or DVD).  The bass is amazing and actually rumbles the wall during a good action movie and find myself I can only keep it at half way or it drowns out the other speakers.  The power to the unit has never been turned off in 4 years and still runs perfectly normal even during power outages not plugged into a surge protector there has been no damage to the internal components.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase and if it ever blows out (which I believe is nearly impossible to do).  I'm not an AV geek but there is a reason this has so many good ratings.
5,I've had a surround system downstairs with my wall projector for several years but never had a subwoofer that worked.  I finally broke down and purchased this on.  HOLY MOLEY !!!!  My life has found new meaning !!!  I now do all my movie watching downstairs and love the thump that this Sub-Woofer delivers.  It shakes the house when I really crank it up !!!  I love it movies are way more awesommer now !!!
5,Great sound for the price.
5,Great sub for the price range
4,I went with the PSW10 since the rest of my speakers in set-up are Polk Audios and opted for the 10 inch so my sub wasn't taking up so much space.  Some people say that subs don't need to match the other speakers in your setup but I decided to be safe and match all of my speakers just in case.For the most part I am very satisfied with this speaker.  I would say for about 98% of the time the sub handles what is thrown at it but I am also not maxing my system out.One complaint is that on very low frecencies and especially ones that last for several seconds such as a scene with a chopper or any other low rumble you will get a lot of port noise from the sub. Taking off the screen covering the port helps a little but not enough to complete solve the port noise.  Again this doesn't happen very often but when it does it can be somewhat annoying.My second complaint very minor which other people have touched upon is that there is no LFE input which you will find on nearly every other sub.  I just used a Y adapter and a RCA audio cable for my hook-up but it would have been nice to have a LFE input.You can definitely find other subs that will be better but you will also have to pay more.  If I had to do it again I would go with the PSW10 as it is a great bang for the buck and doesn't take up as much space as a 12 inch.
5,I learned a little something about receivers. They have a left and a right channel for the subwoofers and if you buy one everything of course goes through the 1 subwoofer. That's the setup I had and I read that I should get two. so I did. One for the Left Channel and one for the right Channel and the difference is night and day. I was watching Independence Day the other night and the subwoofers literally vibrated the entire couch when there were explosions. Well worth the money. In my opinion the base that's coming out of the subwoofers is much clearer then if you just had one.
5,Mo bass
5,Bought woofer to replace klipch woofer sound and base are spot on. Unit is compact design which fits better in our cabinet. I have this hooked up to tv system. Music videos and tv showed sound well defined and crisp. For the price of this unit compared to others you cannot go wrong.
5,When purchasing this subwoofer I thought that it would be a stepping stone subwoofer that I eventually would replace with a 12 inch Polk Audio woofer. After using it for a few months I am here to tell you it is NOT that by any means. I bought this subwoofer in June so that I could use it at home for a few months at lower volumes to break it in and then once I moved to college it would be ready to rock and roll. Right now in my large sized college dorm room I have this subwoofer two polk audio monitor 60 series floor standing speakers a polk audio CS2 center channel speaker and two Bose bookshelf rear speakers. Let me tell you it bumps way beyond what I was expecting. This woofer hits the lowest lows I've heard from any subwoofer including my 2 Pioneer car subwoofers. On songs such as "Red Nose" by Tech N9ne there is a very low repetitive base in between the bigger pounding beats that you can only hear with this woofer. The song just isnt the same with headphones on or any other smaller stereo system. This sub puts out so much power that when I'm sitting at my desk and I have it on at a decent volume I can feel my hairs on my head vibrating and my jeans vibrating from all the bass. THIS THING IS A POWERHOUSE... bottom line there is nothing that it cant keep up with. I actually blew out my tweeter on one of the Monitor 60's it was so loud and this woofer just continued to bump out notes. Very happy with my purchase
5,This subwoofer is a great value.  No it's not super high end for audiophiles but it's a great sub for the money.  I really like Polk products for this exact reason.  I've never had an issue with anything of theirs.  This is the second of this product that I've purchased.  Lost the other one in the divorce.  I also had a set of floor standing speakers a center channel and 4 bookshelf speakers all of the same type in my old home.  They're all quality for the price.  I also own a value soundbar of theirs and lost another of those in the divorce.  I've been satisfied with everything Polk I've purchased.
5,I can't find a single thing wrong with this sub other than the only available finish was black and I would have rather had the woodgrain. The unit still is nice looking and does not draw too much attention due to the color. I connected the sub with a single double male RCA cord from the "Sub-Out" on the receiver to the "Left" input on the sub and turned the Low-Pass (on the sub) setting all the way up. I have not tried running a "Y" adapter on the back of the receiver and a L-R RCA cord to the sub yet because it seems to be working fine as-is.The unit works exactly as advertised and I had a very easy time setting my receiver to power it correctly (reading the instructions helps!). The auto-power works great and I have yet to notice the lag that is mentioned in some of the other reviews.Some background I have 10-15 year old equipment nice but old. Pioneer VSX-D710S Bose 601's (front) Bose 301's (rear) Sony CN5000 (center). I was using a small no-name sub that just was not getting the job done. I have noticed much clearer music from the 601's since I set the cross-over frequency to 150 Hz.If you want the big boom that cracks the plaster joints and makes your dog run and hide this may not be the unit for you but you better be ready to drop 2-3 times (at least) the amount of cash Amazon is asking. I just have to say for $104 delivered  I don't think the average user who is looking for some good bottom end for their music and home-theatre can go wrong here.
5,This powered sub does require a break in period - we recommend 4-6 hours med /high volume (2:30 on volume knob) w /low pass filter set to the lowest frequency (7:00 on low pass knob). Once it is broken in you'll probably adjust to 9:00 on the low pass knob.We believe this is a great value at the current price of $118.00.We own 2 other sets of Polk audio speakers - they are known for high quality sound at listening volumes over loudness.The sound is very clean - it is likely that the sub using  a side loaded driver instead of a down facing one factors heavily in that perception - and ours currently rests on concrete. The amplifier generates plenty of power and we'd definitely recommend better isolation from a wood floor.Sub is 100 watts RMS runs silent with power on and no incoming signal - static free no white noise. Even w/ the auto power on and no incoming signal the device doesn't emit any sound - no hum at all. Because of the constant trickle of current required to enable the Auto On feature some of the subs we've used will hum.The form factor is 14 x 14 so it won't live under a couch or behind the rack /entertainment center. In fact you could probably get by with the PSW108 in most rooms.We saved money on shipping through Amazon and that was one of the deciding factors in buying Polk since subwoofers are very heavy and can cost $40-60 to ship.
5,This sub was paired with Mackie CR4 monitors to make a sound system for a computer.  The sound is just amazing.  Detail clarity and absolute thumping power are all available.This is how connecting The Polk PSW10 and Mackie CR4 Monitors worked for me:1) Mini Jack into PC audio Card for surround speakers. (1 of 5 inputs)  This used a mini jack to RCA cable which was included with the Mackie speakers.2) Mini Jack into PC audio Card for Subwoofer. (1 of 5 inputs)  This used a mini jack to RCA cable.* NOTE: If a person's computer only has one audio out then simply use a splitter to make two audio outs.3) Set Computer Audio software for 2.1 Sound (Oddly my software required setting to 5.1 with rear speakers off).4) Set Subwoofer volume knob to 1/2-3/4.  Set Sub crossover to ~90-100Hz.5) Play music or a movie and set the monitor volume for a desired match with the Sub.Now that the sub and monitors match volume don't touch the volume knob on the sub or the monitors.  Just use your computer to adjust volume up/down.  The sub has a sensor which will turn itself on/off.  One monitor has a switch on the back to turn the pair on/off.
5,I have the PSW10 in a large FROG/den (30' x 20'). At half volume it provides more than enough power to fill the room with clean heard and felt bass. It is (well) matched with a set of Polk 50 Monitor towers and a Polk center channel and in ceiling rears. It is perfect for both music and movies. For music you will hear notes that even with tower speakers you never really heard before (like the snare drum keeping beat). For movies the difference is night and day. The bass can range from tight (gun shots) to full (helicopter taking off) with clarity and ease. You can feel the beat/effects but there is never any rattle.The performance of this subwoofer (like most) is largely dependent on placement. I can place it in the front corner of my room and it provides massive bass but with a lot of bloom. I can place it in another spot and it feels underpowered. When I place it in the "correct" spot (firing perpendicular to the front wall back several feet) it provides loud tight clean audible and felt bass. Anyone not experiencing this either needs to reposition the woofer (search Google for "subwoofer placement") has a bad room for a home theater (i.e. floor to ceiling glass) or is in a massively large room.This subwoofer if positioned right should provide great performance for 99% of users. I see no reason to pay twice as much for the 12 inch model. With the 10 inch at only half power watching a movie with a helicopter landing it sounds like it is coming down in the room. Amazing especially for the price.
5,great sub
5,I loved everything about it
5,I'm an audiophile with a dedicated home theater with a subwoofer that was several times the price of this guy. I got this guy to put in my living room for my regular tv watching. All I wanted was a small sub that would add decent bass for regular daily tv watching. This far surpasses what I expected.The subwoofer is sitting in the corner of a large living room attached to an open den and kitchen area. The sub easily and cleanly fills the rooms up with nice punchy bass.As long as you don't expect the full tightness of a higher end subwoofer with more power this subwoofer is perfect. I recommend this sub for any starter home theater or for casual tv and music listening. Pairs well with the Polk TL line.
5,I was shocked with sound and punch just buy it
4,This was a replacement for a 12" 180 watt (RMS) Infinity subwoofer.Since this subwoofer has less than half the power of my old one (as well as the old one going down to 18Hz) I was worried that I wasn't going to have the low end that I was used to. Much to my surprise the difference wasn't anywhere near as drastic as I thought it was going to be!Without going too deeply into the all-too-subjective terms that people use to try and quantify the sound quality of a loudspeaker (terms like Punchy Smooth Dark Musical etc...) I'm an audio engineer so terms like that drive me crazy... I'll just say that this unit definitely has the ability to provide a nice low end experience even with its relatively low power.I saw in another review mentioning this units' lack of an LFE input. This is true but the manual does tell you how to set the crossover to mimic an LFE input.This unit also has a nice feature to automatically to go into standby mode if there is no signal input after a period of time. Something you don't usually see in such an affordable subwoofer.If you're on a bit of a budget but still want a nice low end experience this is the subwoofer for you.
5,You can spend a lot of money on a subwoofer. I was expecting this one to be just good enough for my desktop 2.1 setup (with Kanto YU2 and Schiit Hel as pre-amp/DAC). However I am thoroughly impressed. For a 10'x12' room I have to run it at half power to keep the sounds balanced. For hip hop I'll turn it up all the way for fun and it shakes the two bathrooms in our 1400sqft house. There doesn't appear to be many compromises here and I'm sure you'd be happy with one of these unless you have a very large room or something.
4,The sound during movies and music is extremely good. With some adjustments to my setup I have almost reached a stage where I do not 'see' the sub- it completely blends in with my speakers. During movies I may need to crank up the sub volume esp if my speaker volumes is low.In my opinion this sub is perfect for small and medium sized home theatre setups where the listening volumes are not going to be loud enough to wake the neighbors up. Although I have not really tried listening at very high volume levels ( I live in an apartment and don't want the neighbors complaining) the volume may get muddy and unclear at very high volumes is my feeling.The finish and build of the sub is very good. It feels very solid and heavy. However the same cannot be said about the cloth grill- it is extremely low quality and all the plastic attachments on it are very low quality and broke within the first couple of uses. I have now removed all the plastic attachments and 'stuck' the front grill using two sided tape and it now seems firmly in place. This is the reason the sub gets only 4 stars and not 5.I guess one cannot have it all at this price. If you can get it for less that $80 it is a steal.
5,I can’t crank it up but the feeling of the bass is amazing….it really fills out the feel of the sound …I keep it low but it fills the bass space…great addition to my system
4,My current setup for my pc is a topping tp21 t amp 2 polk 35b speakers and the psw10 sub. I have the sub hooked into my sound card via an rca to 3.5mm cable since their is no lfe input and the amp hooked to the sound card the same way.I do notice i have turn the amp on the gain down to match the output of the sub but overall the sound is fantastic and it has more then enough kick without getting close to full volume. It has great sounds but does have trouble with the lower bass notes (below 40hz or so). Remember most of us our paying less then 100 bucks for this sub:). This does what i need it to do and great for my pc. It blows away any prefabbed pc setup i looked at including the 250 dollar bose speakers which i thought sounded terrible. This sub is not going to shake your house but is a great accompaniment to get those notes your bookshelf speakers cannot produce. I would get this sub again and again for my purpose the reason it got 4 stars was for difficulty with low notes being idle for a smaller sized room and cannot see it being fit for a large home theater setup. The sound is great and for less then a hundred you can go wrong if using it the same way i am
5,I love Polk products. I live in Baltimore City where Polk started out some thirty years ago.  My first real speakers were Polk’s Monitor 7s. This sub sounds fantastic for the money. It has everything you need; a variable low pass filter volume phase switch RCA line in and speaker level inputs and outputs. It’s ported and I love it. I bought one over five years ago and it was still going strong when it was damaged in an accident. I thought about getting the PSW12 but the 10 is loud enough for me (and my neighbors don’t hate me!) Very highly recommended.
3,Humming sound. Had to return.
5,UPDATE: I called Polk Support and got to a person extremely quickly and in minutes they got me an order confirmation for a replacement. I am upgrading my review to 5 stars as this sub does everything I expected of it  and the warranty work was painless.Bought this back in April 2016. I am using it alongside my Vanatoo computer speakers and it sounds wonderful. I can adjust the phase volume and cutoff to work nicely with my main speakers to provide a rich undertone to my music. My office is rather large and the combination of the main speakers and the Polk Subwoofer filled it in well. Plus while sitting at my desk and running it at lower volumes the music was great while working or doing online research.Unfortunately today it produced a hum and then blew the fuse. I could smell the unmistakable odor of burning electronics. Unit has been unplugged and I will call Polk Warranty service tomorrow since the electronics are warrantied for 3 years and I am still under 2. I hope they work well with me and if they do I will upgrade this to 5 stars since when it was working it sounded.
5,This sub really sounds fantastic.  It gets those lower frequencies that are not heard with most systems.  You miss a lot when you listen to music on your phone laptop or tablet.  With this sub it seems like the bass player is standing right next to you.  Excellent bang for the buck.
5,This is my first home audio sub purchase. I don't have anything to compare it to but I think for a little over $100 this sub works extremely well.I've paired it with some Edifier R1850 powered bookshelf speakers that I have hooked up to my TV and a record player. I listen to Spotify via bluetooth. So a lot of music and movies... Playstation also. I'll be honest and say that it took me a second to figure out how to get this sub to work best for me and my applications. I thought that the sub was really weak at first! It definitely varies depending on the power output! Use an equalizer like in Spotify to really dig in to this sub.My setup is in my living room... When my system is turned up I can definitely feel the sub in the back room in our 2 bedroom apartment. For a little over $100 that is some great bass!
4,So I bought two of these to replace my older sub. First what I like they are well built and easy to adjust and they do sound great.The only reason I gave them a 4 star rating is because it was not the wall shaking window rattling that I was looking for. This sub would be great for an apartment were you what to hear the bass but not feel the bass.
5,I bought this unit to replace my JBL 5.1 home theater (JBL CS6100BG) sub-woofer that went out after 7 years. I did extensive research before buying this sub-woofer and on multiple sites this was listed as either the best home theater sub-woofer or the best overall budget sub-woofer...the reviews were correct! This has far surpassed my expectations for sound quality loudness and design. It literally shakes the room (15' x 20') when movie action scenes or other bass-heavy sounds are played.  The design is simple and compact and in very attractive black wood-grain MDF. As the sub-woofer does not have a dedicated LFE port I hooked it up to my Yamaha RX-V385 LFE port using a RCA Y-cable (AmazonBasics 1-Male to 2-Male RCA Audio Stereo Subwoofer Cable - 8 Feet) and it works perfect. I highly recommend this inexpensive sub-woofer to anyone with a 5.1 or 7.1 home theater system.
5,This adds a TON to the musical experience very highly recommended. I had to put some towels under it because it shakes my walls.
5,I have three Klipsch different powered subwoofers ( 10 and 12 in my LR system ) and a 12 in my music jam/recording studio. This Polk sounds every bit as good.. maybe even better. The bass is tight and vibrant. Uncompressed and natural sounding. I like to think of hitting a 20 foot long thick slab of rubber that tightly runs from wall to wall through a 100 year old wood cabin with a steel bar... just here it sing. Weird? Yea but this sub kicks serious asssss.
5,I loke this subwoofer a lot this isn't really a review but more of a recommendation on how to fix Chuffing bass noise and the rattling sound when using intense amounts of bass.If you lool inside the port hole you'll notice that there is a metal safety bracket and the other end of the port.You can easily remove it by carefully taking off the control panel by using a philips head/ " + " screw head driver to unfasten the philips screws.And with a shorter or "L" shaped philips head screw driver or [Some not to complex level of ingenuity]  you can then unfasten the screws that are holding the Safety bracket in place.Reassemble everything and poof your sound related issues fixed.
5,Got this to replace a blown out 12” powered sub and it’s so much better! The bass is crisp and tight and it still can shake the house! See that little box next to the TV stand in the picture?  That little box fills the house with bass even at low volumes. Makes the surround sound come alive. That scene in Jurassic Park where the T Rex shakes the water in the cup? Easy to duplicate while watching the film with a drink on the coffee table. Amazing for the price. Hell amazing period!
5,I like my music loud with a lot of bass & this delivers.  My neighbors ask me what kind of system I have because u can hear it outside on the sidewalk.  I love it.
5,Wife was out of town and saw this on the deal of the day for under $100 and figured why not.  I have some original Norh 6.5 speakers that sound awesome but have longed for a sub partner for years.  After reading some of the bad reviews here I had my doubts and thought this sub might go back to amazon faster than it arrived.  Well I will tell you this I'm no audiophile.  If you're an audiophile and want me to spit out amps and watt info go read someone else's review.  If you like to close your eyes and get lost in music this sub will work great for you.  Maroon 5 bass was perfect on 'misery'.  So was Cake Ben Folds and all the other stuff I've played on it.  Break in time was about a week and I found that having it in a corner was definitely the way to go. It's a nice looking sub.  Amazon got it here in one week and it was packaged well.  Compared to the Definitive sub in my home theater the instructions on set up of this were fantastic.  I knocked off a star on features since it doesn't have a dedicated LFE input.  I use the L & R with a splitter which is what my Def tech has too and that was 10 times the price.  That's it nice sub sounds great and for $100 bucks including tax and delivery I can't believe how happy I am.
4,Loud enough to annoy the niegbores I don't know how loud you expect it to be lol.Still working after 5 years so that's nice.Make sure you set the crossover right or it will sound loud and not have deep base.I did a base test and could hear it at 25hz.
5,In fact sound is good enough that I've added this subwoofer to the monitor system in a control room of a recording studio to help check the low-end of mixes (I can turn the sub on and off at will).
5,I consider myself to be a mid-level audiophile  I purchased this subwoofer to help fill out the bottoms and it does the job just fine.  I also have it connected to my home entertainment system and it fills the room with the same kind of bass you'd hear in a high end movie theater. I have no reservations in recommending this.  I should add that I previously owned the 12" Polk subwoofer which decided to stop powering up because I left it on 24/7.  Word to the wise use the auto power mode.  Also I think this 10" performs as well the 12".  At least it does for my purposes.
5,Update!  Almost two years later after installing this sub...couldn't be happier with the purchase.  Recently I decided to open the hood and check on settings.  I could barely hear the bass and my tower speakers didn't have much bass.  I had it set correctly for a receiver without a LFE output that is run a RCA cable out to the sub with a splitter to connect both left and right.  Crank the Low Pass knob all the way to the right this in affect does an LFE input.  So simple I just increased the volume on the sub to match better with the Polk towers.  This took some trial and error at a higher volume and using music with a steady bass line like jazz.  My son and I put on some Metallica (Enter Sandman) and it blew us away.  Still highly recommend this sub for a medium or small room!I purchased this sub along with a pair of TSi300's.  The balance is superb.  I don't care for a lot of bass and this unit complements the total sound well without booming.  I have mine turned down more than the manual suggests but it's better for music.  For movies you might want to crank it up more.
5,A much larger and powerful old JVC subwoofer....  died....  my wife insisted in getting something less bulky.....  so after reading reviews... this Polk Audio was ordered....  oooh my my...  this 10"  powered subwoofer is a nice little rascal...  sharp sound.... rumbling bass...  and impacting harminy exactly when it is needed....  regarding power......  let's just say there is pleeeeeeenty.  The only time i would eve consider a real need for a larger option is for a room of dimmessions larger than say 30' x 30' or ewuivalent with high ceilings.... and even then this baby will keep you satisfied.... if you plan to use this inside a smaller location than 900 feet....  like mikey blue eyes would say..." forgedd aboud it "  very happy with the purchase....
5,Exceeded my expectations. Easy multiple setup options and great flexibility in controls. Mine is positioned in a newly renovated area so I plugged it into a switched outlet making it convenient to turn on and off. DO NOT plug into your stereo receiver's AC outlet if you have one. As pointed out in the manual (which you SHOULD read) most  AC outlets located on the back of receivers can only handle about 1 amp of power. Your subwoofer will draw a bit more than that and could possibly blow the fuse inside the stereo amplifier requiring a visit to the repair shop.
5,I've only had the Polk PSW10 series sub for a few weeks. It provides plenty of Bass even at low volume. I bought it to replace my original Sony Sw303 subwoofer which went on the fritz and I could not find anyone to repair it. The Polk is delivering crisp bass to music tv shows and movies we watch.
5,The story of my Amazon order of a Polk PSW10 sub woofer is a good example of why I am a loyal Amazon customer.The sub woofer arrived on a Tuesday and as soon as I plugged it in I knew there was a problem.  The speaker emitted a loud buzz (even in red light rest mode) and did not seem to be receiving any signal from the 5.1 home theater receiver even though option sub woofer was selected and the filter set appropriately.I got on line and indicated a need to exchange the speaker.  Within a few minutes an email arrived directing me to an Amazon return site.  Two minutes after entering the requested data Amazon notified me that the defective speaker would be picked up the next day for return (no return label needed) and that an order for a replacement speaker had been created.The next day (Wednesday) UPS picked up the defective speaker and sent it back to Amazon.The next day after that (Thursday) a new replacement speaker was delivered.  It worked fine.The Polk PSW10 adds a subtle bass emphasis to all types of music and does not overwhelm. This meets my requirements as I believe sub woofers should not call attention to themselves (of course this philosophy applies to more than just sub woofers).The secret to success is service; Amazon knows this and practices it.
4,Polk audio subwoofer may not seem much with uts size but once activated it makes sensurround films like Earthquake rattle like it did in the theaters back then. The best part v is that you don't need to have the volume much to feel the deep bass beneath your feet! Great price for a great item from Polk Audio
3,The bass is not deep enough I expected more  being a 10” woofer. Also you cannot control the volume with the receiver it must be controlled separately using the knob in the rear.
4,This Sub unit fit nicely into my definitive Tech speaker set.  Fantastic unit that can roll with the big guys.
5,I hooked it to my Denon receiver and was wowed the difference from my old sub.  I am 74 so take my appraisal of sound with a grain of salt but I love this device.Pros:  Perfect size for my space and yet sounds great.  Sound for the money is great- even without considering the price.  Infinitely adjustable (with the Denon).Cons:  It is a powered Sub but didn't work with the Subwoofer port on the Denon.  Had to go through a different  port requiring 2 pairs of wires.  Probably a user ignorance or a Denon problem not the Polk unit.
5,Very good 😊👍
4,This is a highly reviewed unit but I think it makes too much electrical noise when plugged in.  When the thing is pumping out music no problem at all.  But mine is in a studio and when things are quiet and I'm working on a project I hear the hum of electrical energy going into it.  I tried to send it back or get it replaced got the runaround about taking the thing apart and from the company.  Not gonna do that - so I endure the humming.  Since the sound is good perhaps worth putting up with - but know that it will make some noise when plugged in.
5,Loved the bass and the crisp deep sound for a 10" Home Theater Sub! Sound quality was better than my JBL Audio 12" AMS car Stereo lol. Which we most remember that quality! Sound quality will blow your mind away! My room is 14x30. After a month now or longer? It either Amp slowly dies out where it will distort over halfway? Sub isn't blown. Great sound but wished they lasted longer! Unless I just got a bad 1? I might even buy another one or 2  just because of the sound quality! I hate distortion..
5,Great unit  good sound levels and control I have an issue however...the remote power line no longer switches the sub on or off with my Denon receiver my Onkyo sub works just fine though. Manually switching the sub on or off is becoming increasingly annoying....and ruins what could have been a nearly-perfect showing.
5,I spent 26 years selling audio and video gear at retail and I can tell you this sub is a ridiculously good value (I paid less than $100). I use it connected to a TV to supplement the bass from a ZVox home theater sound bar and it fills out the low notes beautifully. In my experience adding a subwoofer is the single greatest improvement you can make to a music or movie system and this one is a gem. I gave it 5 stars because it's SO good for its price point though there are of course subs out there that play louder lower are more adjustable and have fancier cabinetry - but that doesn't make them a better value than this one!It's super simple to connect with either speaker wires or a "line level" (red and white connectors) cable so you should be able to connect it to almost anything including directly to a TV. It's easy to adjust which low notes it plays and how loudly so it's not hard to make it complement your main speakers' sound properly. And finally it looks good - nice understated black finish and the brushed silver trim piece adds just enough of an accent.
5,If your musical tastes run to Ozzy and Led Zeppelin at full scream; if you want to rock the stadium and shatter the windows this is not your best choice. Done correctly however it might be a good choice.In my office I have 2 Magnepan MC1 speakers wall mounted on either side of the windows facing my desk. These speakers provide nice crisp and clear highs and mid range. However they lack a lower range. So I ordered this little puppy to fill in where the Maggies can't go.This unit has a built in amplifier. It turns itself on when it senses a signal from your amp or receiver.  When the signal is no longer present it turns itself off. It has controls for volume and cutoff frequency (read the enclosed manual for detail).I set this up by ear until I got a blended sound that was pleasing. The sub fills in the lower range and does it unobtrusively...you don't even know it's there. And that's the key. In my opinion with a sub of this size less is more....meaning lower volume = more pleasing sound. This does what I wanted it to do and understanding it's inherent limitations (no stadium rock) it does it well. For 100 bucks delivered it's a good value today. After all what's it cost to fill your gas tank...and how long does that last?
5,If you have a small room or listen to music mostly this will do everything you need it to and be easy to hide away. Use this with a pair of the Pioneer Andrew Jones bookshelves on stands and you will not believe how good it is. In my case it was noticeably better than the Andrew Jones towers or even the much more expensive Fluance Signature Series monsters. Smaller is actually better in many situations. I learned a valuable lesson.However if like me you have a medium room and watch a lot of movies this sub will max out in any modern action movie. I think 50W RMS just isn't enough though I won't know for sure until I get something more powerful. Maybe it's a limitation of the driver size or the cabinet design (which could be a result of the limited power output).
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This speaker is larger than I anticipated but that isn't a bad thing.  My previous subwoofer was an 8" Logitech system I had put behind my couch so I could feel the vibration.  This Polk subwoofer is far too large for that type of placement.  It is now across the room and I can still feel the vibrations into my couch.  It produces very deep bass.  It was really easy to hook up.  I used the RCA hookups and ended up adjusting the volume dial to about 65%.  This thing has transformed my home theater completely.  I wish I hadn't waited so long to buy it.  In my video the rattling noise is coming from a clock on my wall about 8 feet away.
5,We’ll start from the beginning... I had been eyeballing this sub for quite some time to replace the terrible excuse of a sub I had for my homes 5.1 system.  Since moving into a new home I’m upgrading just about everything in the home a little at a time.The sub arrived with some slight box damage but the foam inside the box kept everything damage free.  Setup is pretty straightforward.. plug in the power cord plug in your audio cable and set the volume and crossover settings.I find subwoofers don’t really vary much from the $100-600 price range in anything over than how loudly they can be pushed.  This sub is great for any living room setup out there.  Very tight and responsive bass.  Pushed deep bass with ease.  Sounds great even at loud volume.I may have been a little skeptical of this purchase  but it’s one I recommend to others and would make again.  Also that’s a Polk Audio TL series center channel mounted below my TV.  And yes that’s the opening to Top Gun.
5,I did what some other reviewers said and bought 2. Very pleased with the kick you get out of these. For the price you can't go wrong
5,As many of the other reviews state the 50W power rating does not do this sub justice for those solely looking at that value for determination of bass quality.  We previously had a 15" 600W sub but at normal listening volumes the sub wouldnt even kick on and show responsiveness.  We "downsized" to the PSW10 but we got way more than expected.  The frequency range on this sub is jaw dropping and on several occasions since setting up the sub I've played back movie scenes just to experience the kind of bass that you feel but don't see again and again.  That being said when the wife and baby are out for the day and I allow the surround sound to stretch its legs the sub keeps pace without an issue.  I would highly recommend this sub to any music or movie enthusiast looking to add great bass range to their surround sound on a budget.  If you're the type that is going to spend thousands of dollars on surround sound then this sub is pocket change to you so you may as well give it a try...you'll end up keeping it and wondering if adding a zero to the price and the power rating is actually worth it.
5,I have a couple of these 10-inch subwoofers for smaller areas and they really do a great job. I think they're perfect for more intimate setups or for dual sub setups for medium sized rooms. Only complaint is that the RCA connection is stereo and therefore requires an adapter for mono style connections which in my experience is pretty standard on most consumer receivers. It's typically a 5-10 dollar adapter and would be great if Polk included it with the sub. At any rate it's a great product.
5,I purchased this for my home office connected via RCA directly to a pair of Edifier R1850DB's which are connected to my laptop via Bluetooth. Even this pretty simple setup sounds very good.I tested it out by playing "Limit to Your Love" by James Blake (which should be everyone's first test for subs) and at about 75% output volume (-/+ 0 on the speakers and ~50% volume on the subwoofer) some papers on my desk started moving. I have never wanted to piss off my neighbors more than right this instant which I think means this is a five star review.Cheers.
5,Never had a powered subwoofer before just my (2) Sony tower speakers from 20 years ago.I run a stereo setup in my TV room and this sub compliments my gear nicely.Wish I had bought one sooner!I know many recommend going to the next higher price point with Polk but if you are like me and want some extra bass without going much over $100 this is for you.Follow the instructions in the users manual for settings.Buy the mediabridge RCA cable in your needed length here on Amazon and viola! A nice enough sub for around $150 taxed and shipped.I was disappointed that I did buy the Y-adapter cable to use with this since I read online (here and on forums) that receivers with a single sub-output will make the sub sound better with the Y-adapter.  This is not true.One sub output on receiver with single RCA going to Y-adapter then going to both White/Red on sub input = horrible buzz.Single RCA from receiver to sub = nice sound.Called Polk customer service and the guy sighed and said 'Yeah I get at least 2 calls like this everyday" if you have one sub output on your receiver you can only run one RCA line.
5,This subwoofer was bought to use with a small pair of bookshelf speakers for a 2.1 speaker configuration in a 14 ft. x 13 ft. room that serves as a secondary audio/video room for more private music listening and TV watching. After some initial tweaking with the controls on the back panel this entry level powered subwoofer delivers a consistent and very satisfying distortion free low end that has matched very well sonically with my bookshelf speakers. I listen to a lot of music watch a lot of drama and action/adventure movies and TV programs so I prefer a well defined low end bass that gives more realism to the music and video content. The Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofer has a small amplifier compared to the more expensive 10” powered subwoofers but this unit provides more than adequate punch and impact of the low end frequencies. I didn’t want a subwoofer that would drown out part of the midrange from the bookshelf speakers so this model meets my needs very well.
5,I bought this for my dorm room. For a room this size this sub can easily pull its own weight (and annoy the rest of the dorm hall).The sub is solid and looks great. The front is plastic and the sides are a wood composite. The diaphragm ring is some sort of foam. It has a relatively high crossover at 80Hz with a usable range of ~150Hz to 35-40Hz. As with most cheaper subs it doesn't have earth shattering rumbles it's more boomy. When set up correctly it sounds great for what it is.I use this sub to assist a Logitech z340 system with a hardware EQ cutting the z340 off at around 80Hz. As expected the sub is what makes this system sound good compared to without it. My current setup is not complete I plan to get some 5" monitors later on.Update 2/8/15:About a month after I purchased this sub my Logitech z340 set died so I replaced them with a Sony STR-AV770 receiver and a pair of Polk s4 monitors I had laying around back at home. As expected I'm now routing my wiring from the receiver to the sub and then to the speakers so the sub sets the crossover. The sound is phenomenal for my small dorm room.
5,Purchased this to replace a cheap 6" sub I'd gotten years ago to bolster the bottom end on my Yamaha shelf system that has a a sub out jack. I cannot speak highly enough of this subwoofer! The frequency range is incredible where I'm hearing low frequencies in music and movies I wasn't aware existed.  Speaking of movies the rumble/vibration this box produces provides a true in theater experience in my living room for action scenes.It took me awhile to dial it in where it wasn't too thin or too thick with my shelf system but it was well worth that effort. Music sounds absolutely amazing at any volume. No distortion. Just full rich bass!Couldn't be happier! 😊
5,For 100$ (current prime price) vs 239$ it looked like a bargain and I am pleased to say that seems to be the case.Have only briefly tested it and I know it's not really meant for this purpose but I am using it with a pair of Micca MB42X speakers and a Topping TP20MkII amp and it does round out the sound nicely and and punch to baselines and low end warmth.I know this is not really a good set up by Hi-fi purists standards (I have some much better Tannoy speakers & Kenwood amp elsewhere that I don't have access to at the moment) - but this combination was a cheap/quick way to get an acceptable sound.Sounded boomy when turning the volume & filter cut-off right up - best to keep it at mid-way position with this speaker amp combo.Build quality seems fine - don't expect the cabinet to be of best quality for this price but it is OK. Only issue I found were the feet at the bottom of the box were not fully screwed in. My tip - use 4 big blobs of 'museum matte' or 'blue tack' (brand in UK) and stick one in each corner to secure this thing to a flat surface and avoid vibrations.
5,I have this paired with a set of Edifier speakers. After I got the level balanced and the frequency pass set it’s been fantastic. Bass rumbles nicely with music or special effects without overwhelming. Three years and going strong.
4,I have purchased two of the items for different rooms. One ( the theater room)  is 26 feet by 16 Feet with 8 feet ceiling. The system also has monitor series 2 floor speakers. In addition Polk surround and a center speaker. This system was strong and the room shakes.  The second room ( great room with kitchen) is 30 feet by 30 feet with a Cathedral ceiling of over 20 ft. This has two s series center speakers with one psw 10 sub. For the size of the room this sub works well ( per my wife) but it is on the limit. I would have gone to the Polk 12 inch 400 w for this size room.
5,I admit I was building a budget surround sound system but this system sounds great. I paired the PSW10 10" sub-woofer with the T15 Bookshelf speakers and T30 Center speaker and it sounds incredible. Immersive sound fills the room effects make me feel like I am in the movie and music sounds great.At first I though I got a DOA sub-woofer as many had reviewed. Unfortunately the PSW10 didn't come with a manual so I looked it up online and downloaded the manual.After I got my Amp setup correctly connected the Amp to the PSW10 and got the PSW10 setup correctly this thing BUMPS out the bass! I actually had to turn the volume down quite a bit as it can rumble the whole room quite a bit.I ordered a sub-woofer out Y splitter cable with my order. I had to turn this feature "ON" with my Amp. I set the phase to 180º and the power to "Auto ON" on the PSW10. Pretty simple once I had the manual.Sounds GREAT!!!!
5,Great rumble. No complaints.
5,Sounds really good.
5,I have the Onkyo RC260 which take two subwoofers. I had an Japanese Onkyo receiver in which I could understand and couldn't get any help from my wife so I sold it. When I received the receiver I need a subwoofer so listening to the good and bad reviews here I bought one. I said what the hell if it only a $100 lets give it a try. Got it a few days after Christmas because I am stationed here in Japan now. I was happy with the bass. All the music that I listen to is hip-hop and R&B which requires a lot of a subwoofer and it handled them with ease. I can tell you stick in the blu ray Ice Age the first one or Toy Story 3 and the two movies will really test your sound system. Boy I can tell you with one of these babies I was shocked but now I got two of them and let me tell you you got to hear to believe it. Crystal cleas BASS. My best friend who serves with me have two mid to high level SVS subwoofer powering his HTS and even he was impressed.I have these boys as my towers ONKYO  D-108E(B)sold in Japan. These boyz as my center channels  ONKYO  D-108C(B)sold in japan with matching bookshelves. I got to tell you  this is an awesome sounding 5.2 system but there room for two more speakers in this systembecause the receiver is 7.2 compatiable. Any rocommendations?
5,This is my second unit and I love them both. I have a 7.1 surround and this second unit is replacing an old Radio Shack/RCA 8" powered subs.  My first one is placed in the front running from the sub outputs from the amp and the second  one sits about 12' away at a 90 degree angle to the first and I run it from the right side middle surround speaker. I have found this setup does not add to much bass with "regular" tv and at lower volumes but rocks the house with movies and music. These subs take everything I can give them with very nice frequency and leveling controls. One unit is more than sufficient but as POWERTOOL sang "Two Heads are Better than One." The two match my built system well being I run two of every speaker placed and digitally leveled by the SONY 7.1 unit.
4,After 3 months of use I will simply state that for the very low cost I got this for this PSW10 is a well above average sub. I set up a 7.2 home theater system after finishing my basement. The powerful Velodyne sub I already had just needed a compliment to really fill out the sound thruout the area and this Polk Audio PSW10 fit the bill perfectly. It's seated diagonally across the room from the other sub. Excellent controls to adjust to personal preferences and clean rich lows with tight punch. Definitely a thumbs up!
4,Sounds real good.
4,I ordered one Polk PSW10 and was mildly pleased after taking it out of the box but started to wonder if it would be enough. It did not have a very powerful amp and my main front speakers [JBL Studio Monitors} were pretty powerful with eight inch woofers that already went pretty low. I waited several days before hooking them up and suddenly realized the path to take. I had a $50.00 gift card I was planning to use on a new receiver. This was only $100.00 minus $50 so that meant I would have a left and right sub for $150. They would also make good bases for the JBL's. It is a good match. I do not get the dinosaur thumps that shake the walls but I get a beautiful fast and solid low end for my movies and music.  And look at the price!!! I will get out my Radio Shack Sound Level Meter and test CD's andin the next few days and chart the measurements. As of now I am running both at about 40% voluume and a 70 CPS crossover.I measured both subs and found they have very useful output to 30 cps. I was more than a little surprised and pleased. This was a great buy and my music never sounded better.Harry in Oklahomacd
5,Hooked this up to the home system for movie surround sound and music.  Easy to set up and sounds great.
5,I've only had this thing a week and have only used it a few times but I'm good with it.  I replaced my very old 6" Yamaha sub with this unit.  I use this for music and movies and it works great by both to me.  Don't fret over the hook-up and EFI chatter reviews.  You have two options to hook it up pick one and move on don't let this scare you.  I hooked it up EFI style frequency knob turned all the way clockwise/right and it's doing great.  I'm still trying to find the right location for it but that will come with time.  I heard a phone commercial last night and it had some deep bass notes and they sounded fantastic on this sub.  Never heard that kind of low bass from my 6" sub that I replaced it with.  If you're a serious audiophile I'm sure you'll find fault.  But if you simply like great sound and great quality you'll be very happy.  And for the price?...c'mon.  The unit also looks even better in person than with the pictures online.One last thing I was very impressed with the packaging.  Just know that it says Polk PSW10 all over the box and with a huge picture so if you get packages left at your door what's in the box is advertised loudly.  And if you're not home you'll need to leave a signed note on your door.
5,I think the base quality is even better than the Rel HT 1205. And blends in with speakers way better as well.
4,For $99 (now less) it's hard to argue that you should get anything else. Good bass simple setup - great edition to your home theater if you're putting together components.UPDATED 1/30/2013:- As one other reviewer noted REMOVE the grille cover over the speaker and port (it just pops off). At certain resonant frequencies that grille makes very weird noises and my PSW10 sounded a lot better without it.- Secondly check for vibrating surfaces near the subwoofer. Mine was pointed right at a small fireplace wood storage door which started rattling during helicopter sounds. I repositioned the subwoofer and that was instantly improved. I'll probably go back and put some weather-stripping around the door for further damping.Running this with Fluance SX-6 bookcase speakers powered from Onkyo TX-NR414:- PSW10 is set at 50% volume on the sub; I notched it up about +2dB in the receiver for my room (about 20x15)- Using the RCA connection from the TX-NR414 Subwoofer Pre-Out jack plugged into the Left jack of the sub- Low pass filter set fully clockwise to 160Hz ; my crossover is set in the receiver to 80Hz as a start but I'll mess with this over timeJust watched Terminator Salvation - not a great movie but the explosions and other bass noises sounded great!
5,When dealing with electronics many give low or negative reviews that hurt a product because they are not experienced with the product. And because of this I was a little nervous to purchase this sub.But I am glad I did. Having more expensive subs in the past I assumed paying $129 for this meant I would just have to deal with a 'lower quality' sub. But what a pleasant surprise to find it's actually a really good little sub. It does what it's meant to do. Hooking up was a breeze. It took me 3 mins to balance the volume between this and my Denon receiver.Totally recommend.
5,Awesome small package with “BIG BASS”
4,This is my second PSW10 subwoofer.  Had I not liked it I would not have bought a second.  I have the first in my TV room with a surround system.  It is a pretty small room and this thing puts out plenty of good bass tho enhance your TV and movie watching.  In addition it is quite a musical sub.  By that I mean that it does not just give you a one-note boom but actually reproduces tones that you can distinguish and sounds good when you play music through your system.  Because I liked the sub I purchased a second to use on my downstairs theater system to add a second subwoofer for distributed bass.  It worked very well for this purpose and filled in the dead spots around the room as well as giving a general improvement to the overall sound.  If you are considering a more expensive sub consider buying two of these.  Two subs will outperform one sub that costs more than twice the price.  If your receiver only has one sub output you can use a Y-splitter to hook them up.  I gave it 4 stars overall but for the price/value it gets a 5.
5,The sub is very clean and well built for my living room system. Has great bass for watching tv and movies but not the greatest for music. That being said it doesn't disappoint esp at the price point I got it for ($100). I got the black one and it appears just like in the picture was well packaged and delivered without a scratch. Also there is a cover that goes over the speaker which is removal so you can keep it with the padded grille cover or leave it as it appears in the picture. Either way it looks aesthetically pleasing. Quick and easy plug in and ready to go. Love the fact that it doesn't stay on all the time like other subs since it receives the cut off from the receiver and shits down. Very clean and great sound esp for the price. Hard to find an even replacement in the price range made by such a reputable company. Highly recommend to those looking for good sound and not trying to spend a lot. That being said this WILL NOT suit those audiophiles out there as it's just not to the high standards in which one would expect. Also if you're an audiophile for the most part you should know if you want great sound and bass you will have to spend more than 1-200 dollars on a sub
4,it was my birthday a few months ago and i needed something that was cheap and could handle something lower than my   Sony MHCEC909iP Mini Hi-Fi Shelf System         could handle which comes with the 8 inch sub so i asked for this. upon arrival it was in good condition no scratches on the sub or rips in the box. i was so excited i ran upstairs and blasted music with it! this is a great subwoofer for the price...  however it doesn't handle the lows as efficiently as i thought. it sounds good for songs like "a milli" by lil wayne but struggles to hit the low beats like "in this thang" by tyga or most other songs off of tyga's "#bitchi'mtheshit" album. with movies this subwoofer is pretty bad... i hate how it doesn't hit some explosions in any transformers movie the bass is just to low for this to handle. this sub is great for the 45-65 hz range but struggles to hit below 40 and all you hear is just port noise. i would recommend waiting until you save up more money and buy the   BIC America F12 12-Inch 475-Watt Front Firing Powered Subwoofer         this one can hit the lows efficiently and the reviews sound like its a pretty amazing subwoofer. i can't wait to order mine!
5,Other than needing a new cable this was an easy rip and replace for my Sony subwoofer that had gone bad. The quality of bass coming from this speaker is great and has paired really well with my in ceiling Polk audio speakers. The quality of the bass is clear and the volume can be adjusted easily. Having this updated/upgraded subwoofer has really helped in the clarity of my audio in the house.
5,It’s perfect for my theater room with great deep sound reproduction
5,This sub sounds great!
3,Bought 3 they only lasted one year!!!!!!!
4,ok so this sub is a very good sub for a small room. if you want to use it in the living room put it in its optimal position in the room and maybe even get two of them. i have two of these subs for a small bedroom and they are great.  my only complaint is how the port noise is very loud and annoying. the foam surrounds are thick and durable and offer a solid rid for the woofer along with the spider(which seems to be solid but i have not checked it out yet. Im sure its fine) the 50watts rms is plenty of power for this 10in. the amp has all the options the high end subs have accept of a LFE(i really wish it had one) and a audio output for daisy chaining.for music these subs offer tight and low bass.  just make sure the gain is a little less than 1/2 and your good to go.for movies these things really rock. explosions and those dramatic bass effects in movies shake your walls. turn you gain up for movies. its great.overall this sub is great but the port noise is really loud. dont push these subs too hard or else they will get that port noise.i uploaded a picture of my set up
5,I bought the PSW10 with the mindset that if it was too small and under powered to rock my home theater I would sell or return it and upgrade to the PSW12 if I was not pleased.  The first movie I watched with the new PSW10 had an explosion that I was not prepared for and it blew me away!  I am a combat vet and for or a brief moment I thought I was hit by an IED while sitting on my couch! I will probably need therapy again!  The explosion sounded very close to the real thing and I felt a small concussion which scared the @#$& out of me!  Thanks be to God I survived to write this review.  For the money this is an amazing  deal.  I am not an audiophile and I have lost most of my hearing in my right ear due to an IED so I am probably not the best person to provide input regarding speakers.  I listen to many types of music to include some RAP and this sub really thumps.  For the price the Polk Audio PSW10 is worth the investment just for testing purposes alone.  I found the PSW10 to be much cleaner and more aggressive than my old Yamaha Sub and I knew immediately that I was keeping it!  Very Impressed!
5,Great sub for the price.  Added to an older hifi setup and it sounds much fuller and better.  The key is to use the speaker level inputs and set the volume and filter to work with the limitations of your existing speakers.  This will enable you to adjust all your speakers with one knob.  Box is solid and does not rattle.  Port is in the front so you can move it close to the wall.
4,I use this subwoofer with my Sony 7.1 receiver via the coaxial input. It is a solid entry level subwoofer and for the price I got it for ($69) it is a steal…after you calibrate it.When I first got the subwoofer I just kept everything to default played some hip hop house music heavy bass scenes in movies…all muddy. I found that turning the volume at about 60-65% and turning the frequency to roughly around the same position sorry don’t know how many hz made the bass much more crisp and clear.I like that it is a front firing subwoofer as I live on the third floor and it makes my roommates happier as they don’t hear every explosion and car chase during games or movies. I use this subwoofer for PC games console games movies and music. Overall the performance is solid and clean. I do sometimes find myself re-calibrating the subwoofer because it isn’t distinct enough but I don’t have too big of a problem with this.Another important note is that this is a LARGE subwoofer. Make sure you have room and check the dimensions.Overall I strongly recommend this subwoofer due to its strong performance and good price.
4,Very satisfied with product overallIt's bigger than i thought it would be used to own a down firing sub which was maybe 2/3 the size of this not a complaint just an observation.Sound is good and can feel the bass when watching films or listening to music.Takes a bit of 'tuning' for your own tastes but all subs do (I've got a 5.1 system with 6' speakers in the wall so they can produce some good low to mid-range and this sub really brings out any bass frequencies nicely)Recommended.
4,I imagine stereo purists can find things not to like....but for most folks with average rooms (not acoustically perfect) who want a clean controllable bass at a reasonable price....this unit will work quite well.  It allows you to attach the subwoofer to your system either thru the usual direct connect....or run your existing speaker wires to the subwoofer and then extend to your regular speakers.  The bass is deep and fairly tight.  Depending on the quality of your source music...(and of course your amplifier)...the bass can get a bit muddy when played at very loud volumes but once again for most folks playing music at moderate to moderately loud levels the bass is quite fine.This unit is a bit 'heavy'....as expected for a quality woofer enclosure...but not so much to be a hindrance.There are much worse woofers out there....some charging a lot more money.
5,My wife and I love this subwoofer!  We are certainly NOT audiophiles by a long shot but we do know what sounds good to us.We have this speaker attached to a Zvox AV200 sound bar and it sounds great!  It really helps bring out the low range sounds that the sound bar was not designed to highlight.We had to go online and do about 2 hours worth of research to learn how to set up and subwoofer like this one but there are plenty of directions out there if you want to do some studying before you try setting it up.In our personal opinions you can't go wrong with this subwoofer and Amazon makes it even better at a cost of $100.00!Be careful you can very easily "rattle the room" by accident.  It has great low range accent.Oh and by the way we connected it to the soundbar by use of a "Y" cable with two RCE plugs on one end and a mini-jack on the other.  This connection is very easy and works well
4,Sound quality on this is pure plenty of power as well. My only issues was with the on and off lever. Feels very cheap. After 3 times that I turned it on the lever got stuck. Now I just use an outlet splitter to turn it on.
5,I like that it has an automatic off/on option switch. Has good overall sound quality and I like the phase switch. I also like that it has a frequency scoop  Contour adjustment on the back  so I can remove those irritating mid-range bass tones . I purchased it to replace my Yamaha 50 watt sub. And it does a good job. Very equal in overall sound quality to my Yamaha. With maybe just a tad more thump. For the money that I paid for it. $100 there's just NOT a better subwoofer on the market for that low price. I'm very happy with it
4,It's Polk Audio  a very good brand name. I have had AND used stereo equipment for decades ... .and these days for television sound systems. Thumbs  up !
3,Not as much bass as I was expecting..
5,I like this sub woofer.  I am using it in a system that is set up to play music not as a home theater sub woofer.  I just set the cross over freq to the freq that the mfr says is the bottom end of my spkrs and then adjust the volume of the sub woofer so that what is coming out of it sounds appropriate compared to the speaker volume.  This sub woofer does add something to the sound of my stereo even in my system where the speakers are rated to go as low as 100 Hz.  If you set the crossover freq too high (which I tried just to hear what would happen) it muddies up and badly deteriorates the low end of your stereo sound.  Also having the volume of the sub woofer set too loud makes things not sound right.But it is good that you can adjust these settings so that you can make this sub woofer fit into your system.  At around 100 bucks I would say that this is a worthwhile addition to my stereo system.  .
5,I had an audiophile quality speaker system that finally quit on my after 40 years. At this point in my life I don't think I could even tell the difference between the old subwoofer and this one. That one was 12" and this one is only 10 but I'm getting as much bass as I need.Back when I bought my old system you could go to any stereo store and audition everything whether it was a high-end system or just the standard mass market brands. I was a little shocked to find out that you can't do that anymore so I had to buy these just based on the recommendations. I have no regrets.
5,The space of my Home Office isn't any more than about 200 SF but this baby puts out more than enough bass for you to at least feel it. It's not earth-shattering but it does the job well. I've listened to many kinds of music from motion picture soundtracks with thumping sound effects associated with them to jazz gospel R&B and more and it works very well.Best of all it's pretty inconspicuous in terms of its footprint. All in all I highly recommend this product especially for the price!
4,I bought this for our master bedroom and it made a positive addition for movie watching.  It is not the beast you want for your home theatre but for the price I would recommend it. For home theatre I would shop REL or SVS.
3,It just recently quit working after 4 years.  Giving a 3 star rating because it was only 150$ and I don't think they last long.  I don't know how long they're supposed to last.
5,I am no audiophile but I am definitely someone who cannot enjoy an entertainment system without a sound system - tv speakers just don't do it for me.  I replaced an old Sony system I had for 15 years with a system I pieced together.  I spent a lot of my receiver and left/right main speakers so I only had a little left for my sub.  I went with this one with the intention of replacing it with a higher end one once I have more budget.  But honestly I am not sure I will need to do so... This thing performs amazingly with my Onkyo tx-nr676 and two JBL Arena 120 speakers.  The fact that I have pretty good side speakers and receiver may play a part in that but I have great bass and clarity so I really can recommend this sub
4,Excellent value and very good sound. Keep in mind that the built in amp will ONLY power the bass not your other speakers.
5,I had a receiver with only some little speakers and needed to get some bass at my house so I went searching for a decently priced subwoofer and this was it. I’m glad I found it. It really let me fully enjoy my music!
4,For the sale price this sub is a steal.  I had a sub with an amp that blew and it was cheaper to buy the PSW10 than repair the blown amp.  It won't shake the house while watching movies but fills in the low end nicely on music.I use it in a 16'x 22' room and I think that is about the upper end for a carpeted room size. Mt last sub was a TSC ASW10 that had significantly more punch but for the price I paid for the Polk I'm content.  It provides unobtrusive low end that doesn't distract from music or movies.If you are hoping for chest-thumping bass I would definitely keep looking.  Despite the many high reviews this thing just doesn't have that kind of power.  The settings are limited so you'll need to use a combination of adjustments on the sub and on your HT amplifier to properly tune the sub to your room conditions.  Placement in the room will also help with tuning but that was not an option that I had.  Don't trust the reviews that say it sounds terrible.  If you don't tune a subwoofer correctly regardless of brand power or price it will sound like crap.
5,EZ to hook up.Understandable documentation.It actually does have documentation.Rattles the room.It is in a small room (about 9x13) but it fills all the rooms on the floor with no trouble and is too loud upstairs unless I turn it down so I don't know how it would fill a big space but I can't even turn it up half way without rattling things off the shelves or upsetting people upstairs. It makes the sound from my tuner way way deeper. I was nervous when I read some of the reviews but it has been so far beyond my expectations. I didn't think it would be this good!
3,I've had this sub for a few weeks now.  I've heard others say it needs to break in I don't know if mine is yet or not but right now it exhibits considerable lag in producing the low tones.  I am running my setup as a dedicated sub out from my receiver with a Y RCA cable so both inputs of the sub are tied to the sub out mono.  I only hear a few frequencies out of the port which sounds very badly tuned to me since its bandwidth is so narrow.  Then the driver itself is very SLOW!  The bass between my woofers on my Klipsch Reference Series floor standers is delivered almost a half beat before the sub hits.  This is really annoying.  As for volume yes it gets loud and yes it makes a lot of bass.  Just not good bass.  Sloppy bass.  The volume control is not perfectly linear either you set the volume on the sub and then change your receiver volume and the sub's placement in the mix changes relative to where it was before. This makes tuning to a range of listening volumes difficult.
5,I don't think anyone would be disappointed in this budget friendly sub.  I figured I would give Polk a try based on other good experiences from the company and I am not disappointed in the least bit. I have it in my garage with two small book shelve speakers and it exceeds my expectations. The sounds is clean the bass is deep and for only 50W RMS I was impressed. It can handle a broad array of music but keep in perspective you will be able to find songs that hit hard maybe from Rap and Country and will push the speaker beyond its comfort zone. I would not hesitate to buy the 12 inch as it's 150W RMS and would be even better sounding but I could not pass up the sweet deal I found on this 10 inch for around $70. I look forward to working in my garage and enjoying my music. PS- I think this speaker would do great as a home movie theater speaker as well.
5,My Yamaha YST- SW100 powered sub woofer after 25 plus years began to show signs of wear n tear with a fluttering sound in the bass. I was more than happy to invest in another Yamaha. However I could not find one within my price range. After reviewing a few other brands I came across the Polk PSW10 which was well within my price range. I read the specs and some of the reviews which were positive. So I decided to make the purchase. I received it two days later and anxiously opened it and plugged it in. I am so pleased with this purchase. The bass is tight precise and clean along with having  the ability to adjust to your desired  frequency that fills the size of your room with quality sound which in my case is 30' x 15'.  Additionally it is beautifully designed in black solid wood grain case that fit perfectly with my decor.
4,The woofer sounds good for the price.
5,Blew up my older Aiwa subwoofer I had been using for years so started looking for a replacement entry level sub. Found this on amazon for a SUPER price of 99 bucks and couldn't belive it. I had just seen the same model as an "open box clearance" at Best Buy and they wanted $189 for it. Went back to Best Buy because I was literally having a party the next day and HAD to have a subwoofer right away. I tried to get the manager to sell me the open one at the amazon price and they refused and said 159 was the lowest they would go. I turned it down and asked a friend to bring his sub with him to the party. Came back home and bought this. It was delivered on a Monday after purchasing on Friday very fast. It sounds fantastic like a different world compared to the Aiwa. I am using it in a home theater with a mid-level Onkyo receiver Cerwin Vega front and center channels and Polk rear speakers. I am honestly blown away by how good this sounds for 99 bucks. It sounds great with the movies but even better when you want to really rock it out. Put on Metallica ...And Justice For All and prepare to get blasted right out of your f**king living room. One of the best subs I have heard and for only 99 bucks. Five Stars.
5,For the price you are getting a deal. This is better than more expensive ones I’ve bought. You will not be disappointed with this.
4,Bass quality is strong and easy to adjust. At high volumes bass can get distorted so you’ll need to adjust the gain on the subwoofer.
5,this unit is packed with POLK POWER PUNCH  YEA BABY  WEEDOGGY jumped right onto my Akoustic audio system at 3000 watts the polk dials in the best drop of all 7 of my subs i have vari 18 and two 18 inch celestrons and Akoustic bass reflex system and my bass subs are independantly powered by 4 channel mixer by Harbinger with two Harbinger 12 inch subs and the Polk bass booms right through all of that!!!
5,Works great and sounds amazing.
5,Thought since it was Polk audio it was going to be great. Well it wasn’t ur sucked! Nothing special it was way worse than I thought. Not worth the money on sale. Very irritating
2,This Polk PSW10 subwoofer  like the Mississippi River could be called the Big Muddy.They do say it has a big bass sound which it delivers in spades.  Loud enough for a party in a large room maybe even outside on the deck.  The low frequency response will definitely get on down into the deeps.  The volume control knob works well and has accurate adjustment.  There is no noticeable hum or hiss.However the sound quality leaves much to be desired.  My $30 Logitech 6 inch subwoofer from Walmart actually sounds better up to medium indoor listening volume although this Polk subwoofer does have much better coverage of the lows below about 55 Hz.Back to sound quality this Polk PSW10 is just loud low frequency mud.  Poor focus minimal clarity lack of "punch" and too much rumble and roar characterize the sound.  There are even slight timing issues at higher volumes.This speaker is OK for chest thumping booms when stuff blows up in a movie but for clear sound in music not so great.So if you want to sound like that broke down rapster dude you can hear driving around from two blocks away in a beat down Civic with a half blown boomer in the back then this is the subwoofer for you.I gave it two stars.  One just for Amazon's excellent on time delivery and one because the unit looks nice and everything works.I am returning this unit and going up one small price point to the Yamaha 8 inch NS-SW050BL.  Should be here tomorrow Jan 4 2020 and we'll see how that one works out.
3,I spent a fair amount of time reading online sub-woofer reviews prior to making a decision. This little box had strong reviews and I wanted to experiment with a sub-woofer addition to my Kef ls50’s. I figured this was a good starting point. Setup was straightforward and after some intensive use over a week I figured it was broken in. So now a month later what do I think.For under $100 this box is hard to beat. Just don’t expect too much. It will add presence to your music and can provide enough boom for movie lovers. That said I felt it was actually muddying the sound of my speakers even with the gain turned down. Neither phase (which makes a difference) gain nor cutoff switches improved this much although they did produce an audible difference. The bass just sounded unfocused and the unit distorts quickly as noted by other reviewers. However some folks can’t seem to hear the difference so this product obviously suits.I wondered if a few dollars more would really make a difference so I bought the Klipsch 10 in to compare. It’s $279 vs the Polk $99. Night and day.....clearly price matters even in the subwoofer world. Clean tight powerful bass from a small cabinet. Meshes with the Kefs with minimal fiddling around.So if all you can afford is $100 don’t hesitate. It gives you lots of boom. But often distorted boom. The Klipsch makes an acoustic bass sound like an acoustic bass...but at a price. The Polk is now in my bedroom hooked up there. The  Klipsch is sitting happily in my main system.
3,This cheap subwoofer isn't bad for it's price but it's not good either. At $149 some would say it's 'great' and they're not entirely wrong. I'm an audiophile and I just can't rate it higher than 'okay'.
3,I originally bought two of these to go with my new home theater because of their price point and reviews. To be fair these were made reasonably well and at "Moderate" volumes sounded pretty good. Perhaps for more of a 2.1 or 2.2 bookshelf system with the intent of listening to music these would be ok. However the 3 main problems I found was the lack of a TRUE LFE input on the sub it's low wattage output capabilities meaning it had to be pushed hard to reach higher listening levels. And most importantly the subwoofers inabilty to handle low frequency below the 30-35hz range makes it a poor choice for home theaters and movies. Both subs had SIGNIFICANT port noise or "Chuffing" at low frequency resulting in poor quality sound. Thus I returned both and got a proper SVS Subwoofer which costed quite a bit more. But the sound quality for low frequency was no contest between the polk and SVS. I guess the saying "you get what you pay for" still holds true and expectations should be measured accordingly... leave some budget for atleast 1 high quality subwoofer if your looking to watch lots of movies or game.-Matt G.
5,Amazing bass for a 10 inch. Outstanding design fills the room with smooth sophisticated well balanced sound. Auto on off is great. Could not be happier. Highly recommend.
5,Finally got a reciver that handles 2 subwoofers. So I bought 2 of these babies and placed 1 in front and 1 in the back of my home theater room. Replacing my single 8" subwoofer. Put the movie TRON into my player and was blow-away by the base in the race scene. Great sounds without the distortion you sometimes get in heavy base scenes. I love my subwoofers!😃
5,This was a Christmas gift for my son and he likes it.
5,Works good for what I need.  I watch an occasional movie and it adds all the bass I desire at an affordable price.  It also looks pretty good too.
5,Good quality subwoofer lose a lot of air and doesn't break the bank. My movies sound like they're supposed to now.
5,Subwoofer is powerful and has deep bass. Great value for what you pay. Perfect for any home theatre system.
5,This is a very good sub IF you pay under $300 for it.  Its great for the money and not too huge.  It is well made and the design is nice.  Its not a powerhouse with hundreds of watts but you probably don't need that much bass anyway.  If you live in an apt this is plenty of sub.  I have a typical LA living room open to dining and kitchen.  I use ORB Audio speakers and this is a great 10" driver to match well with small speakers.  Th PSW 111 is also great for the ORBs.
4,Great Buy for the Price . Sounds Great fills the Void of my Stereo Amplifier of lower end. Amplifier with Bass out  Easy Connection. Plenty Bass Response
5,For the price this delivers amazing sound! I purchased this to go along with the Pioneer system I got for my grandparents 900 sq ft entertainment room. I have it set to half-volume and it’s low on the pioneer but it’s deep rich and still loud. They have over 3000 square feet in their home and you can hear/feel the bass at the other end of the house if you want to. I love the sound that this seek product produces. Of course there are better products but for the price this is perfect. I will buy this for myself when I don’t have neighbors so close. For now my sound bar will have to do. My 72 yo grandpa has figured out how to turn it up and it drives my 70 yo grandma crazy. Haha.
5,I have a Dayton Audio APA102 amplifier that fits under my couch to power some in-wall speakers.  My Echo Dot is connected to it.  The sound has always left something to be desired.  I tried an Echo Sub and was extremely displeased.  It actually made the sound worse!  I returned my Echo Sub and bought this one based on its stellar reviews and it did not disappoint!Setup: I just took the speaker outputs of the APA102 and fed them directly into this subwoofer and then connected the speakers to the subwoofer.  This has the benefit of allowing you to specify the crossover frequency.  You can also set the volume of the subwoofer relative to the speakers.  Once you get the crossover frequency and volume set on the subwoofer you can pretty much just forget about it!  My music sounds much more complete now and I'm fully enjoying the sound!
5,Having been serious about audio gear for around 50 years I expected adequate bass out of this unit to supplement some speakers lacking on the low end. Connected to my receiver's subwoofer signal level output I began to test the sound with some of my favorite recordings. Quite simply I have been totally impressed by the quality of the sound. I have reasonable expectations for how much volume a single 10" driver can create. When staying within appropriate sound levels the quality of sound is surprising. Bass extension sounds flat to very low frequencies and the transient response for material like drum solos is much better than I expected for a small ported cabinet system such as this. Auto power on / off is flawless with no discernible switching noise.  I'm totally satisfied by my purchase!
5,My wife purchased this as an anniversary gift to replace an 8" Infinity sub that came in a 5.1 surround system in a box. I was happy with the Infinity for what it was until the amp died. This is definitely an upgrade! I have a small room and this sub is way more than is needed to thoroughly rock the room. I actually have it turned down quite a bit. I have an LFE or dedicated sub out from my amp and have it plugged into one of the RCA jacks sounds great! This speaker is large but did fit in the same area under a corner table so it is out if the way and the bass still fills the room without issue. Very happy with this sub!
4,I've had good subwoofers in the past. This one is just so-so. The weak link seems to be the amplifier/cross-over part. For example using the speaker level inputs on the sub with the variable cross-over set to 100 hertz I'm still overdriving my bookshelf speakers at only a modest volume. I know it's the sub that's causing this because I don't have the problem when I go straight to the speakers from my receiver. Next time I would pay the extra money for a better quality sub.Update: I received a response from Polk customer service reminding me that the speaker level inputs go directly to the output circuits. In other words the bookshelf speakers should not have seen any change in signal. Coincidentally I purchased a much larger set of Polk speakers (Tsi 400 tower speakers) to replace the Tsi 100 bookshelf speakers I had in my original review. The difference is night and day. There is no longer any distortion of the output from the sub to the main speakers. I'm happy.
3,It has a really decent sound for movies and music it shakes the floor. I would give it a 5 if wasn’t spoiled by the klipsh 8’ woofer that I replaced with this Polk 10’. Overall decent sound and great purchase for the price it definitely gets the job done.
5,The reviews are all right. This is an amazing subwoofer. Great price but pay attention to the size! It's huge! Comes in a big box too and it was almost too big for my basement studio.It's powered by a standard wall plug so if you have a pre-amp outpout on your receiver like I do it it's great. My receiver only had one output slot so I did need to get this cord from Amazon to make it workhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01D5H8O9S?psc Tested it at 3/4 volume with some Modselektor and a bit of Bassnectar and it was honestly too much! Rattled the windows. I have yet to take it all the way up  Later I was playing COD 4 (on PC because I'm classy) and my wife had to call me from upstairs on my cell phone  because the sound of bass bullets was waking her up.  Anyway she's ok
4,I have a very high end complete surround speaker system and the powered subwoofer went bad.  I looked at Klipsch and other high end replacements but since we really don't use it very often and since the other speakers carry the sound I decided to try this Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofer.  I must say for the price I'm impressed.  It gives me back the rumble to the movies that I was missing.  I have noticed that it can overdrive the speaker if I have it up too high but that was when I was first testing it.  I don't think I'd actually run it that high during normal movies and I am one to push the limits a bit.  So it's very good.  I only gave it 4 stars because all I have to compare it with is another speaker that would cost close to 10 times the cost of this one.  I'd definitely recommend this speaker.
5,So I bought two of these to put in each of my closets in my room.  This was one of the best decisions I have made in terms of setting up my room.  I have two of these connected to a Sony receiver and 2 Polk Audio T15 shelf speakers and it awesome.  During parties I can turn these all the way up with the knob on the back and it is honestly incredible how much it shakes the house.  Playing any bass-heavy music is very entertaining simply because it shakes my entire room like an earthquake and still sounds crisp.  I also watch a lot of movies and albeit two of these is definitely overkill for my 10/12 room action scenes will never be the same.  For the price I think these are a great buyand if youre a basshead like myself these are a must purchase.  I'm confident in the build quality (they can handle a rowdy frat house) so i think i will be bringing these to my own home once I move out.
5,I did lots of research before I  bought this item.  I have 4 older bose 101 speakers and adding this Sub along with my Yamaha 5.1 receiver  sounds great.  I am totally satisfied.  Well worth the money.
5,Easy to hook up. Very high quality
5,In my opinion  you can't beat this unit for the money.  The sound is tremendous  deep  thundering clean bass.  I am so extremely pleased that I actually bought a second unit.  Why not?  The price is just right and my Yamaha receiver provided two sub-woofer output connectors although a Y connector for a single output would have been just fine.  In configuring my receiver setup  I set all my speakers to "small" and sent the sub woofer crossover to 160hz thus letting the subs do all the bass work - doing what they do best.  In my setup  I could not be more pleased and Polk is a name that has been around for years on end.  If for some reason I had to buy again  I would not hesitate one bit.
5,After reading reviews and watching YouTube videos I decided to take the plunge on this PSW10 INCH Sub...I paired this with the Fluance 7.0 surround system and this thing feels and sounds like I'm in a Rocket ship when needed and on a desert Island with the waves brushing up on the sand when called upon...I am more than satisfied with this Sub...After several tweeks and placements of the Sub i found the sweetest spot to achieve optimum results...What are you waiting for???? just order it you'll be glad you did...I am
5,A friend gave me a left and right set of their speakers which sounded fantastic.  We changed receivers for the TV and the one we purchased didn't have a powered subwoofer output just the signal.I added this and VOILA! the room filled up with low end.  I'm a professional in the production side of the music biz so my ears are attuned to good quality audio speakers (my recording studio speakers ran me thousands of $'s).You can't beat Polk's gear unless you want to go full on audiophile and spend thousands.  This is quality.
5,Purchased 2 of these PSW10 subwoofers to compliment the recently purchased Polk T15 bookshelf speakers. Both are very inexpensive yet sound great! Had some questions regarding connecting dual subwoofers and received a timely response from Polk's customer support. Couldn't be happier.These will be used for a DIY (Raspberry Pi 4b+ DAC HAT & in-speaker powered mono amps) wireless multi-room streaming system throughout the house. (so far I have a superior 4.2 Wifi sound system @ ~$750 instead of Sonos @ ~$3700 ;-)
4,The product description doesn't make it clear that this product doesn't have a subwoofer connection. The sound quality achieved by connecting a subwoofer cord to one input is poor. When I ordered a 1 x 2 Wye connector to input into both inputs the sound quality is  good. The product description should explicitly state that it doesn't have a subwoofer connection and that an adapter is recommended or better yet included with the subwoofer.
5,I would say that this subwoofer is great if you’re looking for something that is not really expensive. The sound quality is decent if you’re looking for bass that doesn’t shake things off the walls. It does put out some thumping bass but nothing too crazy. Overall if you want something that sounds good and isn’t pricey then you’ll love this sub.
5,My sub was getting pretty old so it was high time I upgraded. I could have gone with a Klipsch at 3X the price but it would have been complete overkill for what I wanted. This subby really brought my system up a few levels with a clarity I have not heard in a long time. And ya can't beat the price. I'm just really happy with the sound and quality.
5,Based on user reviews here I added the PSW10 as the second sub in a new 9.2 surround system.Outstanding performance.
5,Blew me away
4,I had a KLH ASW 120watt sub-woofer that always seemed to have some goofy thing going on with it hums pops etc...eventually the amplifier capacitors crapped. Of course just after the limited warranty. It was a costco 100buck item so what do you expect. This one seems to push and thump just as good or close to the klh but without all the extraneous problematic issues and has a 3 year warranty. It goes in a small entertainment room and seems to add just enough low end to the surround system. It has a little bit lower wattage output then the comparable KLH did but i can live with that being the quality seems to be much better. Side note on "super saver shipping"...seems that the warehouse simply sits on the unit for days on end until they decide the magic day to ship. so if it tells you to expect in 5-8 days they may not actually ship until the day before the 8th day i have had to send emails asking why it hadnt even shipped yet understanding that it could take 5-8 days for transportation but to not even get it out of the warehouse for 5 days? hmmm....
4,This is a really good sub for the price.  I was using a JBL side-facing sub with my home entertainment system before it blew and replaced it with this Polk.  The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because the upper range of the low-end is a bit muddy.  I also realize this could be due to the subwoofer EQ and crossover of my receiver - and am trying to explore that possibility.  If I find out that is the case I will amend this review and then hopefully it will be a 5 star review.
5,If you are looking for an inexpensive Sub Woofer that sounds great this is it.  I have this installed in my garage with a 70 volt speaker system.  It brought much need bass to the system.  It also has great crossover.  I was a little skeptical. this unit would perform they way it does when I first purchased because of the price.  After reading other reviews and now having it installed and listening  I would recommend this unit to anyone that is looking to save $200 to $300 from higher end models.
3,So I got this to replace a small 7 inch sub from 10 years ago and while this one plays much louder it has a horrible distortion problem making music at high volumes unenjoyable. At moderate volumes it’s pretty good. Goes right down to 30 herts with no problems. Playing music loud will cause the front firing port to make an awful chuffing sound severely distorting the bass response. But at low and medium volumes it preforms just fine. Don’t expect rock solid bass I found this sub to be on the muddy side. For movies and media it’s fantastic adds a huge cinematic vibe to movies. Just be warned this isn’t a musical sub and you should consider another option. My old 7 inch actually sounded BETTER at low volumes.Giving three stars because there is a sweet spot where it throw a good amount of bass without much distortion or chuffing which is why I’ve decided to keep it.
5,Combined with a mini-amp and Orb Audio speakers for a simple 2.1 channel system the Polk Audio sub-woofer provides perfect bass tones for the overall system and compliments the Orb Audio speakers perfectly. As someone who appreciates and has multiple home theater systems operating in home and office I was delighted at the results delivered by this sub-woofer (especially when combined with the Fosi amp and Orb speakers) which were primarily installed for use with my computer and Bluetooth music devices. Once the treble and bass levels were set I was moved by the audio excellence provided by this simple system and the Polk Audio sub-woofer was a major part of the success. One of the best products AND best valued products I've ever purchased on Amazon.
5,Product is worth the price
5,This speaker simply proved itself right out of the box.  Nice bass range.  Love the auto bass sensing feature along with being able to adjust the bass output.  Multiple options for hooking up the speaker.  For the money this was an excellent choice for me.  It fills out the home theater system well.  The previous top end subwoofer bit the dust and this does the job quite well as a replacement.  Very pleased.
5,I am quite surprised at this sub hopefully it lasts but it is no doubt the best bang for the buck sub I’ve ever bought. A little background I own Focal Electra 1038be’s for my main surround setup that are 15 grand. I wouldn’t pair this with those but I have a smaller surround using JBL sats and this is a perfect pair. I removed a humming Sunfire sub to put this in its place its smooth and gets pretty low I’m impressed. I almost didn't believe all the great reviews and here I am writing one. Super happy with it!
5,The bass is deep and clear. The controls are easy to use for tuning the sub to fit your tastes.  I like movies and music and have it set up for that. Everyone tells me how much better it sounds with the added bass.  I also like the auto on feature.
5,I have recently bought the Lyxpro SPA-8 to use with the projector outside for movies and to play music outside. The Lyxpro is a very good unit except for one thing. Since it has an 8 inch woofer the low bass is not quite present. So I got the PSW10 to balance out the full spectrum of sound. With the Lyxpro this is a full range system with great low bass now. Music sounds great but I haven't got a chance yet to test a movie.
5,I wanted to add a nice stereo setup to our main living area and purchased a good turntable and a set of Audioengine A2+ speakers. The setup sounded great but due to the small size of the Audioengine speakers was a little light on the bass. So after doing a bunch of research and having had good experience with Polk speakers going back to the 80's I bought this sub. Wow...what a difference. My setup now has a full sound with great punchy lows. I love the auto-off feature and the crossover allows you to easily dial in the right range with this sub. If you're looking to add some nice bottom to a small or midsize system you can't go wrong with this sub.
5,I don't care how surround my sound is so long as it sounds good so I've been getting by on a ZVOX Mini for some time. While the Mini is a pretty potent little speaker with crisp dialogue and sharp effects the bass doesn't need much to start distorting. If I'm underground in Skyrim where the ambient thrum creeps up or if I'm watching Game of Thrones with the Horde wandering the Dothraki Sea there's rattling in the cabinet and I hate that. I want a reasonable amount of audio output and when a Star Destroyer creeps onto the screen I want to feel it. After doing lots of research I settled on this sub and I'm pretty darn pleased with it. I can adjust the phase to try to fill in the gaps left by cabinet speaker it goes pleasantly loud and it gets the job done. I have it in a finished basement about 10'x15' and it gives me the bass I want when a helicopter is overhead or when Cate Blanchett outlines the War of the Ring. It didn't complicate my experience at all and it did what I wanted. I would've liked it at $80 over the current $100 price but either way it's lived up to my expectations.
5,I purchased a PSW10 to go with my Vanatoo T0's per their recommendation.  They clearly know what they are talking about if you have heard their speakers.  Initially I was pretty unsure about the sound.  After about 15 hours of break in and removing the rat guard (search for mods) I am quite pleased at the value.  Note the rat guard is no longer glued.  And there appears to be more fill and and wrapping of the cables internally then some of the earlier images I have seen.  Great deal.  Really 4.5 because of the performance to value.  Clearly this is not a $300 sub and you shouldn't expect this.  But for filling in the sound and adding some bump to music it is great.  Not stupid music mind you but reasonable high quality audio.  Yes if you throw and ton of super low tones at it or expect it to shake your bones for movies it is not the right solution.
5,After 17 years of faithful service my old JBL 150-watt sub finally took the dirt nap. Rest well old friend thanks for the years of thumpage.The Polk audio PSW10 moved right in and stepped up literally without missing a beat. For reference I am running a newer Yamaha receiver Polk towers for the rear Polk studio monitors for the fronts and a Polk for the center channel. I hooked up the PSW10 ran YPAO (Yamaha's awesome auto setup program) and then queued up Symphony X's 'The Odyssey' (because excellent equipment should only be tested with excellent music) and was right blown away. The old JBL was starting to get some volume level 'cliffs' where it would not kick on below a certain volume level. The PSW10 provides the low-end at appropriate volumes all the way down to a whisper. I seriously cannot think of anything else I would want this thing to do or be besides what it is: a well-made very reasonably priced subwoofer.
4,Should have measure to be certain. But it fits on my entertainment wall and provides the needed bass for my 12x8x6 Klipsch R-41M bookshelf speakers. Works great with my old receiver that doesn't have a woofer output. Just connect the receiver speakers to the subwoofer and then the subwoofer to the klipschs. Only hassle is the controls are in the rear so adjustments aren't easy.
4,The unit came well packed and set up was a breeze. The unit  has all the features needed for most set-ups. The only knock and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is it does not have a single audio input just a left right so a y-cable is the proper choice. I have to say I did run it with just the left hooked up from my sub-out and the results were fine and it does allow for the full range speaker outs to be run through it but I wanted to use the dedicated sub-output of my system. Really feature packed and interfacing in any system should be easy all be it your gonna have to work with it a bit to optimize performance as each situation is different. The addition of the auto-on feature as a switchable option is way cool and a phase switch is awesome. There is also a low pass filter adjustment which is always helpfull and of course a volume control all worked as advertised.Now to the meat and potatos. It sounds great. No woofiness clean and crisp. Polk Audio is still one of the best in the biz!!
5,After around 3 months of use I remain happy with this choice.  Ideally the 12 inch speaker would have been better for my room size but the cost of that speaker was FAR more than this reasonably priced 10 inch.  Since we do not like or want tons of booming bass this is OK but if that is your thing and you have a large space you may want to consider the larger speaker.
5,Works as advertised. Easy to set up. Can be hooked up directly with subwoofer input or use speaker wires which I used because my Sony receiver output for subwoofer only works when a dvd is playing and will not work for tv or other music sources but that is  a problem with my receiver not the subwoofer.  So I hooked up the front speaker wires to the subwoofer and the output is awesome for bass sounds.  It comes on automatically and will shut down automatically when not in  use.  A green light on the back will let you know its on but if you have any signficant bass sounds from music or movies you won't need the light to tell you the sound will be evident.  I don't need to turn the volume past about 1/3 to get all the bass I need. Turn up the volume switch to halfway if you really want to rock it. Any further will just damage your internal organs.  You could pay for the the more expensive polk subwoofer but don't know why you would need it for household use unless you live in a mansion.  This one is plenty good enough if you just want to annoy your neighbors who thankfully are not close to my house.
4,It took some dialing in with my stereo. I have Polk Audio center front and surround speakers but it took some effort to balance the speakers. I still need to adjust the sub when I change from Movie settings to Music. All-in-all the sound is great its window and wall shaking if you wind it up. But it took some effort to nail down the right balance -  this doesn't reflect on the sub's performance but just beware that adding a sub - in my case it was a replacement sub - can take massaging of the inputs and crossovers.
5,I purchased this sub to go along with my two Micca OoO Book Shelf speakers. I use it for my PC set up and I have to say I'm very happy. It may be overkill for my setup but I rather be have that extra bass and have the ability to turn it down rather than wish I had more bass. It'll definitely rattle some windows on a few floors of a building lol If you're looking for something with a lot of bass or want to add a sub to your PC setup I recommend this sub.
5,I really like it
4,I acquired this subwoofer to help out some old VS-80 speakers and it has not disappointed. Very good rolling bass for a 10 inch subwoofer. Installation was not hard at all the sound is very good for its price range.The adjustable crossover and volume controls make sure that you can balance sound properly with your existing speakers so the low range sounds are more accurate. The sound is quite clear the only thing I wish is that this went closer to 20Hz on the low end.Sure there's fancier models but they're also a lot more expensive. Having tuned the aformentioned settings I find this little subwoofer to be an excellent value for the price. If you're looking to enhance your sound on a budget this is definitely a subwoofer to consider.Functionally for most music and as a home theater subwoofer this will work excellent especially at its pricing points. I would not recommend this for something where absurd levels of bass are required such as letting the neighbors enjoy your rap collection or trying to create earthquakes in the living room but aside from that it is an excellent product.
5,While I don't use this as my main sub for the home theatre this sub was purchased for a 2.1 channel system.  The bass output is decent for a small sub.  The auto on/off setting helps conserve energy when the sub is not in use.  Once the sub receives a signal from the receiver it automatically turns itself on and pumps out the bass that is expected of a music system.  I bought this from amazon warehouse deals so while it was not 'new' the scratch and dent version does have a couple of dents in the corners but nothing that anyone can see unless they are looking for the imperfections.  Of course I knew going in on the scratch and dent version that there may be some issues but nothing that would cause the sub not to perform and so far so good.  Sub performs as expected.  I have not as mentioned listened to it with movies and the like but for music it's great.
5,For Christmas I got the Pioneer VSX-821-K 5.1 receiver. I spent a lot of time researching 5.1 systems and was leaning towards the Polk Audio RM705 5.1 Home Theater System. I read ton's of reviews about the Energy Classic and Energy Micro RC HTS but just could not spend $400. Two days after Christmas I found the Energy Micro RC 5-speaker system for $159 from New Egg. I knew this was a sign and jumped on them immediately. I had been researching this Subwoofer just in case I bought a 5 speaker setup and needed a sub. The price and size seemed to good to be true and it surely was. This Subwoofer paired with the Pioneer receiver and Energy Micro's is a perfect match. I have not had a lot of time to play around but I have this thing about 1/4 of the way turned up and it is shaking my condo. I am not an audiophile but this thing is shaking the windows and sounds amazing. I cannot wait to break the speakers in and calibrate everything. Don't take my word for it. You will not be disappointed. The only con I have noticed so far has been that the Subwoofer does not automatically turn on at lower volumes. This has only happened once but so far so good. Everything else is perfect.
5,Got this in 2015 it’s 2018 now i’ve been through a few moves so durability 10/10. IMHO for the price it cannot be beaten. It really helps if you run a test tone through it and set the filter to only allow sounds lower than 80hz through it as this will maintain the life of the speaker. No point in having your subwoofer try to play mids and highs. I use mine with the now discontinued Polk N1 surround bar (at time of review still available from second party sellers) and I believe it (the subwoofer) sounds  as good as my Bose subwoofer. I will say I have a relatively small area I listen to it in but if I turn it up too loud the neighbors in my apartment complex can hear it so it’s more than powerful enough to suit my needs. No distortion...not a single time in the years i’ve owned mine.
5,I was a little reluctant  to purchase a subwoofer  for $120. After reading most of the reviews I took the bait and purchased the subwoofer.  What a pleasant surprise.  The clarity of lows and mid range was fantastic. Granted this subwoofer is designed for small/midsize rooms it lived up to the hype. Polk Audio really put out a great speaker for money. If you have a small or midsize room you should give it a try...you too may be surprised.
4,Don’t have any experience with subwoofers to compare it to but it does enrich the sound and people comment on my great stereo
5,This sub hits all the lies. Connected my main speakers into sub and it sounds great. Easy to adjust with the knobs. My media room/ dart room jams.
5,I bought this sub at it's full price 129.99 unfortunately after it had gone down to 99 with the prime sale deal they have.. o well still a good deal. wasn't real impressed at first with the bass didn't seem as loud as I thought it should of been but after a couple of uses the sound improved a good amount. So I am pleased with it overall especially for the price. I had a boston sub before that worked well probably on par with this one but was much more expensive so I do have some experience with subs and I am a bit of an audiofile. Will see how long it last. Will update if any problems occur in the future.
5,I bought this when it was on sale at a whopping $70 to replace my blown out Bose subwoofer acoustimass 10 which workd fine for over 10 years. I looked high and low to replace my Bose sub until I discovered this Polk Sub and bought it at an amazing price to preference ratio. I can honestly say that it is a hug upgrade from my original Bose sub when it was working the bass is really deep and you can hear meds as well if you tune it correctly with built in EQ. I was going to get the big brother of this sub which is twice its price and twice the performance but I wanted to test it first and hear the power not only I was hearing it but I felt it as well. This sub has amazing responds  and its clarity and crisp tight bass that it produces with different listening mode. If your Bose system still works then get this sub for a better immerse listening in music movies recording and gaming which I use for. The Bose sub compared to the Polk sub is night and day the Polk sub just make your listen come alive.
5,Got my surround hooked up and this sub is awesome.  Dog was confuse by the surround when he walked up to the sub it was part of the movie with some serious bass and about gave him a a heart attack.  Thats when I knew we got a good one!
5,This sub is no joke. I bought it so when me and my wife play Just Dance we get some extra bass. But I caught myself leaving it on whenever I’m watching movies or tv shows. The extra bass this sub puts out is a hidden gem you didn’t realize you needed until you hear it. It makes playing video games 10x more fun and watching movies and tv shows more enjoyable. I’m so glad I purchased this sub and for the price you can’t go wrong. It’s a 10” sub so it’s a bit punchy on notes but it hits the low notes so beautifully. No regrets at all!
4,I bought this for a home theater system...Denon receiver/Jbl hls center/Jbl 3 way towers with 8" woofers/Mtx surrounds with 5 1/4" drivers. The sub integrates well and it is an unbelievable value! On another system I am using a $1200 Ar sub and there is no comparison but I paid less than $100 for this sub!! I think that even $200 would be a fair price for this sub and I highly recommend it. It does huff on some of the lower frequencies especially with bluray but I can't complain. It's performance far surpasses it's price!Update: After watching a lot of blurays the "huffing" on lower frequencies really started bothering me so I removed the amp so I could access the end of the port tube I removed the grill and added a internal flare for the port tube and now it sounds smoother with less Huffing and I am happier with it. Still no where near my AR sub but I have realistic expectations of my purchases based on priceSo for less than $100 you really can't beat it...although I probably voided my warranty but I'm OK with that.
5,For the money Im not sure this sub can be beat. Very responsive and sounds amazing. Im very pleased adding this sub to my home theater. Sounds great durring movies and playing all types of music.
3,I own three subwoofers (Dayton Audio SUB-1000 a Vizio 2.1 soundbar and this Polk). The Polk is "decent" but gives up too soon and doesn't go as "low" or "hit" as strongly as the Dayton Audio 10" powered subwoofer. The Vizio is made for TV's but I use it on the computer (Bluetooth). It sounds excellent but I wouldn't call it's subwoofer a subwoofer...more like a good sounding woofer. Anyways back to the Polk...I would say the sound is really good for average listening and everything works but when pushed hard it "huffs" through the bass port and seems to struggle with low-lows (the wall shaking deep pipe organ "feel the bass" sounds). The Dayton Audio subwoofer WILL go low and literally remove pictures off the walls...the Polk will try. IMHO buy the Dayton Audio SUB-1000 (10") for a few bucks more and have 1) more power/sound 2) deepest of lows. The only things I don't like about the Dayton Audio: if using the speaker level binding posts...they are wimpy (think 18 AWG sized wires). They easily break apart if trying to insert any "normal" sized speaker wires. To avert this...pray your receiver has a "SUB OUT" on it. Mine does...and it works. Lastly the "Off-On-Auto" is set to high. Meaning the Auto requires higher volumes to turn on. I just leave it in the "On" position. Back to the Polk...not terribly bad for $99 but it is not for serious music lovers (esp those expecting crazy deep bass). It gets really "muddy" sounding when pushed (and "huffs" out that bass port). Almost like the actual 10" driver is undersized or something.
5,The sound is great and for the cost so worth it.  I am solely using it for music; streaming vinyl cassette and cd.  I want to purchase one for my tv system eventually. Have a Klipsch subwoofer but I would get frustrated because it was ‘off’ or ‘auto’ so it would not always kick on.  This has the option of ‘on’ which is great!
4,Bought this sub for $120.There is some port noise but it's basically inaudible from listening position. It can sound a little loose and muddy at times; not too overbearing though. The fit & finish is nice although there are some imperfections along the seams on the face of my unit. The black wood laminate and grille cover are of quality materials and appearance. The feet this sub sits on are plastic not rubber- *I intend to address this with rubber grip pads [*Update: Done; much better.]. It does have plenty of power/bass especially in a smaller listening environment. The crossover/filter works well. It sounds good on both music and movies with limitations. Has a good full sound and really drops low for a budget 10" sub. The price is pretty amazing at 99$. Only other con I have is the foam surround on the driver (rubber is better/more durable). In all this sub sounds pretty good. An excellent choice for anyone looking to move up from a home-theater-in-a-box unit.**One can't stress enough the placement (location and facing direction) of a subwoofer in a given room. Done properly this sub performs and is an impressive very affordable subwoofer.
5,After nearly a decade of every day use and they (I bought 2) and they still impress me. For the $ you simply can’t beat the Polk sub thousands of positive reviews can’t be wrong… and they will stand the test of time.
5,great sub system overall delivers comparable performance to 500Wrms amp and sub system I transplanted into the enclosure after I used it in its stock configuration for a few months. on the inside of the aesthetically pleasing and rock solid enclosure polk has a no-frills driver design with unpainted steel frame and good sized magnet (estimating by eye ~40 ounces)  the enclosure build quality is good and includes polyfill so i ended up putting in my own sub into the box after it was time to upgrade my setup. in particilar it has reinforced fastener locations which are wisely socket head cap screws with lumber threads! apparently the plastic feet aren’t very tough so i removed them and added some silicon corner protectors. i hope to use the original polk amp low pass filter and 10” driver in a future project. at $90 the assembled system and indeed the recycled sub-components are a steal.
5,I liked the price and got just what I wanted...More BOOM BOOM !
5,Very impressive for the price. But setup is critically important.1. Make sure the subwoofer is in phase without your front speakers. Do it right. You’ll never have to worry about this step again.2. If you have an 5.1 AV receiver with a sub output set the crossover to 80 Hz in the receiver and turn the sub’s low-pass filter know all the way clockwise.3. In the receiver set your front speakers to “small.” This is not a slur on your speakers! It ensures that the sub “roils on” at the same rate that your front speakers “roll off” and makes for a smooth fit between the sub and the rest of your system.All that’s left to do is to set the sub’s volume to a level that pleases you. Using this method I have a far better sounding system than I had with my old $500 Velodyne that recently bit the dust.
5,This subwoofer was $99 when I bought it in 2009 and it has stood the test of time.  I'm replacing the 10" driver now as I also replaced drivers in the Polk Audio Monitor 50s that I bought at the same time.  I found a well-reviewed 10" driver replacement at Parts Express.  I don't know if Polk Audio still manufactures this little 10" sub but for it to still be available after 10+ years is a testament to its longevity.  The Polk cabinets make driver replacement easy.  (With the exception of the tweeters on the M50 towers which are cut with curves.)
4,This a pretty great subwoofer that is really capable of putting out way more than its 50W RMS would have you believe. However other reviewers' notes regarding its boominess are well founded. This subwoofer out of the box is fairly boomy with somewhat poorly defined bass notes.Fortunately there is a simple fix. The ten or so small screws on the back plate-amp can be removed giving you access to the inside of the subwoofer. You'll note that there is a pad of folded stuffing glued to the bottom of the subwoofer: this is there to dampen the soundwaves and prevent backwave. Unfortunately it's not sufficient.Add in some polyfill until the cavity directly behind the driver is filled fairly tightly then put a little more between the plate amp and the dividing wall seal it back up and enjoy.My bass notes are significantly clearer now with kick drums sounding like kick drums and bass guitars that don't blend into ambiguity.Considering I paid $66 for this sub the added minor hassle of installing polyfill is perfectly fine by me.
5,This sub make a big improvement to my sound system.  I had a cheap surround sound setup with a center channel 4 satellites and a pass-through non-powered sub.  Rewiring for the front satellites and installing this made a big difference to music and movies.  It took me a while to get the gain settings where I liked them between the back of the unit and my receiver. Once I figured that out it was a great improvement for sports movies and music.  I would recommend this to anyone with a similar setup as me.
5,This sub is extraordinary value for the money.The construction quality is excellent.  I have owned many Polk Audio products over the years and I have never been disappointed. This is no exception.The sub has a full gamut of low level and high level inputs so you are covered with just about any type of home theater setup.  The auto standby feature works flawlessly and there is a phase shift switch in the event that your main speakers have been hooked up in reverse.I am using this sub in a room that is approximately 25 feet by 15 feet. The sub has no issue whatsoever filling the room with deep sound at the mid volume setting.I purchased this sub to replace a malfunctioning 200 watt sub that was approximately 10 years old. The sound quality from the Polk is comparable if not superior.All in all this sub offers outstanding quality for the price.  Very pleased with the purchase.
5,The Polk Audio PSW10 is one hell of a speaker. It makes television watching a complete theater experience. I love it.
4,Originally gave this sub 3 stars because it seemed to bottom out a bit even when properly set up but it may have just been a break in issue as it seemed to resolve itself without me changing any of the settings on the sub or my receiver. Since my original purchase I actually ended up purchasing a second one to add as second sub to a different surround sound system and the second sub sounded great right out of the box maybe issue with original one was just a fluke? I wish the sub had an LFE input but for the money it's a good value and you can can just use a Y cable to attach to L/R input and set the low pass filter to 160hz which seems to let the receiver manage the cutoff. Note that the 12" version which is about $100 more does have the LFE input.
4,Great subwoofer I own two myself but cant turn the sub volume over halfway without the fear of blowing the sub but amazing for movies.
5,While I'm comparing this to an older Infinity powered 12" sub which I love I have to admit that for the price and a smaller size (10") this powered sub absolutely rocks the house.  I hooked it up a 2.1 set up with a pair of Canton XL.3 monitors and a Yamaha receiver with the sub crossover set at 100hz and the sound is absolutely fantastic; rattling the windows at the right places just like it should.It has a nice separation too between the bass in some songs that is supposed to do some serious booming and the nice tight bass drum of other rock and roll.This is a fantastic sub and I'm looking forward to many years of enjoyment from it.
5,I purchased this subwoofer to round off my home theater system as I had had a couple of front tower speakers with reasonable bass for a few years and wanted to add something to the lower end. I was a little skeptical but hooked this sub up to my Yamaha amp fired up Spider-Man Homecoming on 4K UHD BluRay and was blown away by how much bass this little box added! As well as being a great price and offering exceptional value for money the smaller form factor means that I can easily hide it in a corner without it being overbearing. Really impressed!
5,Alert!  This sub's price flucuates wildly....anywhere from $79 to over $138. I bought this Polk sub to add some low-end to my Cambridge Soundworks Model 6 workout room speakers because they needed some help with some low-end impact. I was pleasantly surprised at how this sub filled in the missing bass and I was really impressed at just how musical the bottom-end had become.  Polk is a great company with a reputation for making musical speakers that out-perform the competition's speakers.  They continue that tradition with this little sub.  I didn't have to spend a fortune for the Cambridge Soundworks Model 6 speakers AND the Polk Sub and I now have a satellite-sub package that sounds great and can play loudly while I workout.  One more piece of information....I had to run a 75 foot sub cable (Mediabridge Cables purchased through Amazon) from my home theater equipment rack to the workout room where the Cambridge speakers and the Polk sub are located.  I thought for sure that extremely long cable run would cause interference audio drop-outs or possibly cause the bass signal to be so weak that no bass would be heard at all.  WRONG!  The whole set-up works great!!  Highly recommended!!
4,Unfortunately I live in an apartment. That being said I went a little crazy one Saturday afternoon and turned it up to see what I could get out of it and wasn’t disappointed. It’s a bit of a waist if you have to control the volume like I do. If you have the ability to run free with it then it’s definitely worth the purchase. Spoiler- Played Br. Sleep and when the heart beat is playing during the scene really adds the the effects of the show.
5,Hooked this up to my M-45 Yamaha amp Onkyo preamp and JBL L100t speakers. After I got it mostly tuned in it sounds very nice in my 14x28 living room. Has a ton of bass if you want or need it. I just wanted enough thump to take some relief off my JBLs I bought 33 years ago and this sub did the trick. Matches very well with already powerful speakers. Real easy to hook up through speaker inputs/outputs and looks nice if you want to set it out in the open. The more I play it at semi high volume it seems to be sounding better. May be some breaking in I guess. I’m no expert by any means but this put another phase of life into my system. Not a bad 90 bucks for a quality made speaker.
5,This is my first Polk product. I am very pleased. I replaced my Infinity 5.1 subwoofer as it was snapping and popping when the signal feed to it was high due to the music or TV program sound track. Had thought about replacing the speaker inside the cabinet but found out it was cheaper to just get a replacement sub. This unit works great. I had no idea I was missing that much sound from the old unit. The cabinet is simple nothing fancy but you get what you pay for. The sound that comes out of it is wonderful. I immediately tuned in some symphonic channels on my Direct TV receiver to give it a test. It was a pleasure to listen to. For the money this unit is worth every penny. I have only had it a few days but so far so good. Based on others recommendations I expect it should hold up well. Would purchase it again.
5,These little babies make awesome bass shakers. I have a 7.8.4 system and have four if these behind my chairs. Forget using transducers that only output 50watts use a sub instead. All my subs are ported and the integration into my other 4 subs (2 SVS PB3000 2 SVS 25-31CS+) is exceptional. I would say 4 of these is almost equivalent to a PB2000 except you will get a much lower frequency response with the PB/PC2000. They do slam around the 40-60hz area though. All in all if you want a better room response pick up multiple subs and for this price you really can't go wrong.
3,I wasn't blown away at all by this subwoofer but once I got all the quirks worked out it fits into my setup pretty well. The first thing I'll say about this subwoofer is PORT NOISE oh GOD the port noise. After looking into this issue I realized I was far from the only one dealing with it but at least there was a "simple" fix available. Just unscrew all the screws on the plate amp and unscrew the two screws from the weird metal grate that's at the back of the port but make sure you have a VERY small or better yet a right-angle screw driver handy because that little piece of metal was a huge pain to unscrew. Then pry that bastard off because they also GLUED it in. Now that you've done that you have a functional subwoofer that doesn't sound quite as much like complete garbage. I mean $100 for a sub is pretty entry level but to me this thing just kinda has a 'loose' sound to it and wasn't as punchy and tight as I would have liked. Even on paper it seems pretty unimpressive but if you really care about mind-blowing bass you're probably not looking at a subwoofer in this price range. If you pair this with a good set of speakers though this thing starts to pull its weight especially if you place it right. All in all I don't regret buying it but if you have the money I would recommend buying something with more power and frequency response like the bic f-12.
4,First off this is one of the better sounding subs I've heard for under 100 bucks. Has good punch and good response. The biggest detraction that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is port noise. If you really get some intense bass going at a louder level this causes you to be able to hear the air coming out of the port. This detracts from the sound and I think the port needs to be a little bigger in diameter and placed in the back. You don't see that many front firing subwoofers with the port in the front. Sub also isn't magnetically shielded so you probably don't want to have this sitting right next to your TV.I think this is a very good option for anybody wanting a sub that obviously doesn't want to spend a lot of money. Of course there are better options for more $$ but in the under $100 range this is a winner. I opted for the cherry over the black despite everything in my entertainment center being black. Too much black!! lol....the cherry finish looks nice and I think looks a little classier than basic black.
4,As the saying goes. You get what you pay for so if you are expecting a phenomenal sub-woofer with thundering bass in movie sceens than you need to spend some more money. If you are just looking to fill out the bottom end with a pair of bookshelf speakers this sub will do that very well !! After hooking up my new sub I listened to a couple hours of various classic rock. The Eagles Pink Floyd Lynard Skynyrd and  Bob Seger. It took a little tweaking and I finally got it dialed in at around 3 on the volume and around 120 htz. The sub sounded pretty good. Than I switched to some hip hop and I was rather suprised at how well this sub performed. It's a great buy at only $90. If you are realistic about your expectations you may be suprised as well.
5,I am not an audiophile but I know good sound when I hear it and I heard it from this sub. Don't let the 50 RMS and 100 Max Watts dissuade you. This thing packs a punch. For now I have my audio signals fed through my Vizio sound bar which has a sub-out. I had to turn down the bass setting from the sound bar all the way because it is simply too much for my small theater room to handle. Well worth the money. Some have had problems with the auto off function I have not. The manual says there is a 15 minute delay for the sub to turn off once there is no signal which is what I experience.Though this 10" sub may not be up to snuff for snooty cinema snobs but I was quite impressed.
5,I recently purchased this subwoofer and I very rarely leave reviews but had to give this speaker a shout out. I have it paired with a Yamaha rx-v377  av receiver and two Polk t15 bookshelf speakers. I use it primarily for listening to music at decent volume but nothing too crazy and it sounds great. I was inclined to write a review just because of how much this subwoofer puts out while sounding clean with no distortion. It was used recently for a barn dance party paired up with 4 Polk t15 speakers playing loud bass heavy music and it more than kept up. The sound filled the barn and it was set only at 1/2 of max gain. Couldn't be happier with this purchase. I've had many different brands of speakers and Polk never disappoints. If your looking for a great deal on a sub to complete your sound system look no further. There's a reason this has been an Amazon best seller for so long.
5,Absolutely love this subwoofer! I have it hooked up to a Sony receiver. The bass is nice smooth sound. You’re able to adjust the bass on the back of the receiver. I’m also able to adjust the bass on my receiver as well so between the two I was able to get a really nice bass sound with no crackle or popping. I’m super happy with subwoofer. I let everybody that comes over listen to it. If I could rate it higher than five stars I would.
5,Bought this to replace my old Atlantic Technologies T90PBM subwoofer that gave up the ghost a few years back and I have been very happy with it so far.  I was kind of iffy on the purchase at first but there were so many good reviews I decided to go ahead and give it a try.There have been more than a couple of instances where i was actually amazed by the amount of bass this thing produced (daredevil season 3 ep 10 for example).  I'm sure their are better sounding subs out there somewhere but I am quite pleased by the sound I get from it and I feel like I am getting much more than my money's worth from it.So bottom line if you're on the fence about it like I was I would go ahead and give it a shot.
5,Bought this to go with a Sony 7.2 Atmos receiver.  The room is fairly small so one sub was enough although my receiver supports two.  No complaints at all so far as the sub produces plenty of bass and sounds good with the other speakers in my setup.  I connected with an RCA plug and plugged it into only the L port without using a splitter and the sound is great.  The speaker is a bit bigger than I envisioned but I was able to move things around enough to put it where I wanted.  Highly recommended and a great price!
5,the bass is incredible
5,Do not listen to the bad reviews. That said this is one awesome sub. It does rattle a large bedroom but also more than enough bass for a decent sized living room as well. Maybe I have good accoustics idk but I doubt it. This is a great buy and I highly recommend it perfect addition to any surround sound set up
5,Awesome for the price I payed this will solve your need of a sub in your home system for general uses. If you're a famous movie star you might want something else to go along with your$100000 system but for the rest of us this is just sufficient enough. I heard the capacitor in this goes out after a couple of years. Do not throw it away when that happens just buy a new capacitor and solder it in. At that point you'll have upgraded this sub to 2x's it's value and an aftermarket cap will last the rest of your life probably.
5,My wife and I have always been pleased with our audio system. Recently we decided to update since our equiptmentwas about 15 years old but still working well. We moved the old Sony equiptment and Cambridge System Sixspeakers downstairs and bought an Onkyo Tx-sr308 receiver and Sony SS-F5000 speakers. We already hadsurround speakers in place. It wasen't until we visited a friend who has a sub-woofer that we realized what we weremissing. The next day I was searching the internet for a subwoofer and found the Polk psw-10 for justunder $100. After reading many of the reviews I thought I would give it a shot. I ordered it from Amazon andhad it two days later. It brought life to what we thought was a good sound. We liked it so much thattwo days later we bought a second one for the old Sony. The Onkyo has a subwoofer pre out jack and I boughtthe recommended cable for it. The Sony doesn't have an lfe jack so I ran 16 guage speaker wire to the subwooferthen out to the speakers. Both hookups provide excellent quality sound. My wife and I are very pleased withthe psw-10 subwoofers and the price is right. I've dealt with Amazon many times and have have always beensatisfied with the company.
5,I recently had a Sony 100 watt subwoofer.  Not very good quality but I had a really limited budget when I bought it. So when it died I started checking Craigslist Best Buy and a the lot.  I happened to check Amazon and boy am I glad I did!  This is a great sub for the money.  I am using it in my home theater matched with Bose 201 fronts Bose VM-100 center and Infinity rears.  I have a small movie room and this sub is perfect for it.  The quality of construction sound and proven durability of Polk Audio products (as I learned from other reviews and listening to them in the store) made this an easy decision at $89. I can't believe the quality for under $100.  I listened to much more expensive subs and am happy to say this this one performs as well or better than most of them!  Obviously there are bigger better subs out there but you can't touch anything like this in Best Buy without spending 3-4 times as much.  I have never owned Polk Audio products in the past but when it comes time to get some more gear it will be on the top of my list.  Great performance for anyone wanting a quality subwoofer while not breaking the bank.
4,Quality sounddeep bass.  The only thing I dislike is it’s now very loud for 100 watts.  I have to crank the sound system up just about all the way to get it to actually add a more noticeable low end bass to the mix.
5,Purchased this subwoofer as a replacement for a defective Boston subwoofer that came as part of a poor quality out of box home theatre-denon AVR-1312.  Another problem with this home theatre is that the receiver skips and blacks out the video and audio that it receives from the PS3.  Customer service from Boston was a big failure and for the price of sending out your failed equipment to their company headquarters for diagnostics (even under warranty) you can buy a superior subwoofer.Anyhow after a full day of playing radio MP3s and video games this polk subwoofer performed very well.  I do have the capability of fine tuning some of the audio characteristics like polarity crossover frequency and other things however it plays very well how I originially set it up.  Even though it replaced a higher wattage subwoofer from Boston Acoustics this has better and louder sound.  My living room the subwoofer plays in is 20x15 ft.  That room leads openly into the dining room and kitchen (another 22x15 ft) and the sound the sub makes is loud enough and very clear.  I'm very happy with this product.  By the way don't buy Denon or Boston Acoustics.Good luck.
5,This is my second purchase of one of these subs. They sound great.
3,Don't recommend I have two subs and they both have the same cabinet rattle or subwoofer chuffing when bass is increase during peak.  Don't recommend.
5,This sub bumps! I thought maybe I might need something bigger than a 10 inch to make things rattle but this sub gets the job done. Dont want to play at max sound. Dont want the cops called or things to fall off the shelves in the living room. This sub is perfect for my 2 15 inch speakers for future events and parties. This has been a great purchase for a great price. Might even get a second one.
4,You can't beat its performance for the price in fact you'll have to pay a lot more money to get noticeably better performance from a sub. The cheap plastic feet are why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. I replaced my feet today and I wish I had done so on day one instead of waiting til one foot broke.
5,Owned one years ago and enjoyed it... but always felt it needed a partner.Well replacing a pair of aging subs after one broke I got 2 of these and the quality wiring for them to properly connect... The fine-tuning and all in about $300 later they sound like a $600+ subwoofer and can shake the house with crisp clean sound to boot! Highly responsive and easily tuned for music movies and other audiophile needs at a low price point. With 2 of them they support great volume with no distortion but not recommended for an apartment. The noise complaints would never end but absolutely worth the money and have a solid build quality.
5,The sound quality is amazing. I liked it so much I brought one for my neighbor
4,Works great. Deep noticeable bass. Woofer unit did not come with any wiring to connect to home audio system. It was simply the woofer and power cord. Had to reorder the necessary cables in order to be able to use it with my home system. That seemed odd
3,The Port sucks .. def should not have put the port of this speaker bc it is very nice. But the Port ruins it
5,Wow great sounding and tight. Upgrading old surround speakers and sub. Went with;Polk OWM3 for the fronts Polk TL1 Center Speaker and the PSW 10". Can't wait to replace the rear speakers with the OWM3's.Night and day difference in sound quality versus the 10+ year old Yamaha speakers.The bass is crisp and clear. For the price cannot be beat!
4,Got this when I got a new HDTV and surround receiver. I used my old speakers except I needed a powered woofer to replace my old non-powered one. It supplies decent bass without booming and is fine for the volume I usually use. I would think if you like super-bass or play really loudly you would need something bigger but this is fine for me.UPDATE: After two and a half years this subwoofer is still working perfectly. I wish it had and LFE connection but I connected the LFE output to a RCA Y-connector to the L-R speaker inputs and turned the crossover all the way up and it seems to work fine. I paired this speaker with 4 Polk TL2 satellites and a TL2 center and it does just fine for me in my 15 by 15 foot room. I use it mostly for TV and movies but sounds good to me with music as well. A real audiophile would probably not be satisfied with this entry-level bargain but I would venture to guess that most people would  be very happy with it.
5,I am a picky buyer that obsessively reviews before buying.  I can honestly say I believe this may very well be THE BEST product for the money available anywhere!  Every time I listen to my system I literally shake my head with the amazement of quality sound for what I have spent!  Reviews on this are 100% legit!
5,This subwoofer completed my polk surround sound setup. GReat sound. Living on the second floor of an apartment I had to turn the bass volume down below halfway. So far no complaints from the neighbors and it still sounds good.
5,Bought one of these to use with my new Pioneer VSX-1021-K AV receiver.  Never owned a subwoofer before and never knew what I was missing.  We put this subwoofer behind the couch and tuned into an internet Dance/Trance station and cranked it up.  I had the amplifier almost maxed out and the sub handled the bass with ease.  My son and I sat on the couch unable to stop laughing from the amazing pounding massage this sub gave us.  We loved it so much that we decided to get another one and now I have them both on half volume for the same amount of bass.  Our main speakers are old Bose 701's (which also put out great bass) and our center is a Definitive Mythos 3.  Our other speakers are Boston Acoustics and old Bose center channel speakers but will soon be replaced by new Bose 201's for the rear surround and Polk Audio OWM3 for the front high surround.  I'm 46 years old and have loved music all my life but this setup makes me feel like a tough little teenager again.  If you buy the Polk PSW10 you won't regret it if clean and tight bass is what you seek.
5,I am not an "audiophile" or whatever but ive always had decent stereo equipment... This sub is way big for my needs ha!  Sounds decent and was cheap so whatever.... Look at my setup in my room rediculois ha!EDIT:  Now that I have had this for some time... its awesome.  Sounds much better after its "broken in".  Im not really an audio guy so I dont know if thats really normal for a sub to get stretched out and used a bit before it gets better but thats the case here.  It sounds way better now than it did when I first got it.
5,Bought this to use with my JBL's (Decade L-36's) upstairs in my living room but after taking it out of the box I decided to hook it up to my home theater in the basement for a test drive with my new Yamaha amp(RX-V675) that is a 7.2 with 2 sub outs. I already had my Klipsch KSW 12-105w sub hooked up and couldn't realistically imagine needing 2 subs as I've always been happy with my 15 year old Klipsch sub. The PSW10 far exceeded my expectations and after a couple hours of listening I couldn't bring myself to move it upstairs. It really keeps up with the Klipsch if not surpassing it in depth and clarity. I bought a 2nd PSW10 to use with my JBL's and those 40 year old speakers are now a new listening experience. Only downside is after getting the new amp several months ago and seeing the 2 sub outs I commented to my wife that I couldn't imagine ANYONE needing 2 home theater subs and she now will not let me forget that premature statement.
5,I am definitely not an audio expert but I do know what sounds good to my ears.  I ordered three pairs of the Polk Audio Atrium 4 speakers to put in my great room (30 x 40 ft) with paneled cathedral ceiling. The speakers sounded great but were not designed to deliver a lot of bass.  I ordered two of these sub-woofers and the results are wonderful.As with many others I was not looking for booming bass for home theater.  My intention was to listen to music as I read or study and I wanted to complete the low end of the spectrum.  I was not disappointed.I am using a simple two channel amplifier/receiver.  Usually I feed the audio from my iPod or my computer.  The output from the amplifier goes into a Sima SSW-L4EX speaker selector.  Three of the outputs go to the three set of Atrium speakers and the fourth output goes to the two sub-woofers.  This allows me to easily control the volume of the sub-woofers without having to touch the subs.  For me this works well.
5,This little speaker packs a punch. I have had my eye on upgrading my Polk RTi sound system by adding a sub and for $99 it was hard to pass this up. Very happy with the purchase.Theater experienceWhile the bass is not the deepest it is more than sufficient for watching movies and TV shows.Music experienceThis is only a single 10" sub so you are not going to get crazy deep bass when the volume is turned up high... but that's okay because the bass it does produce at moderate to high volumes is still pretty good.
5,When you order this subwoofer remember the price you are paying. Then you will be pleasantly surprised when you turn it on the first time. It sounds better than subs twice the price. I always recommend this sub to anyone trying to build a decent sound system on a budet.
5,I have been researching this little (BIG) Sub for a while.......... And needed to replace a older sub.Lets cut to the chase i'm glad i brought two when they were on sale.They sound amazing in my home setup! I have a 5.2.4 step up.I can't tell where the subs are in the room with everything on (which is a good thing)FYI you should not be able to say "oh the sub is in that corner etc" when listening to them.Even bass threw out the room.  Bass heavy movies sound like being in your favorite cinema.
5,I put my system together in 2011 and loved it but the 8" Polk subwoofer I had originally gave up the ghost. I did my research and decided to go with this PSW10 which seemed like a good deal at $100. I wasn't in a big hurry since I was working out of town so I set a price alert with another site and in a few days the price dropped to $80 so I bought it.I finally got home and installed it in my cabinet and boy does this thing rumble! So much so that I had to move it outside the cabinet because it rattled everything. Super deep super crisp and just plain nice sound.I'm no audiophile but I have to think that at $80 or $100 bucks this has to be one of the best values out there.
4,home theater full strong lows adding to full sound
5,This subwoofer is unbeatable for the money. I have this tied into a Denon 5.1 surround sound system. The connection to the subwoofer out ports on the Denon don't produce a signal that the subwoofer can use. I hooked it directly up to the front speakers and it works excellent. I am very pleased with my purchase. I wouldn't suggest buying this subwoofer if you're expecting it to perform like $1000 subwoofer. The subwoofer performs better than I expected for the price. Based on the price if that's what you want you will get a good value.
5,When I first got the speaker wired it up and started using it every thing was good.  A few days later I noticed the auto-on feature wasn't working.  I would turn the receiver on but the sub would not turn on even though the green light was on.  I would have to either unplug the RCA cable(s) or even unplug the power cord and plug it back in to get it to start working.This continued to happen every few days so I would need to unplug cables to get it to work.  I tried different RCA cables but the same problem happened.  Then last night when I turned the receiver on the speaker worked for about 2 seconds and then just turned off and I had to unplug the power cable to reset it.  This is getting annoying so I did a replacement and hope a new one works.<edit>New sub woofer works perfectly.  I always leave it in Auto-On and when the receiver turns on the sub turns on right away as it is supposed to.  Maybe my original one was a dud.  Changed to 5 star.
4,Great sub for the price. Great sound and hits low to medium bass lines pretty well. Does have an issue of chuffing out the port at higher volumes (sounds like flapping paper out of port). With that being said the woofer sounds great when finding the right setting to adjust it to. Although it is unfortunate that you can't push this woofer to it's maximum power capability. Its a great woofer for a lower budget sound system that you want to sound good and have a good amount of bass. One note about the subs physicality is the fact that it is large. Not too big but bigger than the pictures make it seem. All in all I would recommend this sub to anyone buying on a budget. But if you have more to spend I personally would go with one of kiplisch's 10in 300w woofers. Little more pricey but worth every cent.
5,I have been using this sub for over a month now and I'm very happy with it. Paid $89 for it with free shipping. Have it setup in my 5.1 Home theater: Onkyo SR313 receiver Panasonic 46" ST30 plasma Sony S590 blu-ray Sony CE500 cd player & Onkyo satellite speakers. Have it placed in the left front corner of a 13' x 19" playroom. Movies come alive and the bass is excellent. Sure a true audiophile might notice imperfections but for the majority of us this is a great sounding sub. Polk is also a great company with outstanding products. Would love to upgrade someday to their Blackstone TL250 speaker set. Also you do not need a Y connector cable as some have said. My receiver has one "sub out" output and you can connect to either the right or left input on the sub. You then turn the low pass dial all the way to the right (160) Then set the receiver to the crossover point of your choice given the speaker size you have. I did this in the setup of the Onkyo. I send all frequencies below 100 to the sub. Many people who use satellites set their receivers to crossover at 120.
5,I was half way skeptical of how this thing would perform. First off shipping was fast and perfect condition second the price for what you get is amazing! I was surprised at the physical size of the speaker but then again I didn't really pay much attention to the dimensions when I ordered it. On to the speaker its self. THIS THING PUMPS! If you are looking for a 'little' extra bass this isn't for you. if you want a high quality sub that has the ability to shake the painting off your wall buy this! I hooked it up last night tested it with playing music watching TV movies and of course... some loud Call of Duty. It just wakes up the audio in all your movies tv and amazing for gaming. The real bonus was when I started streaming music I had to play some bass songs just to test it and it made me giggle like a high school kid with a new stereo in my beater. Excellent speaker amazing price great seller. 5 star
5,The speaker produces nice bass with some tweaking. If you run it from the Sub-out on the back of your receiver you might want to use a Y-splitter for input since there is no LFE Input. The splitter is not required but you'll get a better sound.From the manual" "After you make this Sub Out connection turn the "Low Pass" filter fully clockwise. This will in effect create an LFE input."
5,When this baby came to my front door I was expecting it to be another amazon crap vendor that wasn't quality.This is Quality.This is a perfect home subwoofer office man cave.I recommend putting it in your attic above wherever you have your main speakers at or room above.Like holy ground beef. My floor and tables vibrate. It's soothing and has a great sound.
5,Gets really loud.Works awesome if you just want to supplement your system. I have it up just high enough where the bass comes in only when my speakers can't pick it up. If that's what you plan to do for ~$100 it's hard to beatCONNECTION: this confused me for a minute. For this or any other sub with similar connections you plug the SUB cable into your receiver and plug the other end into the Left channel on the sub. Got this for my first system so that wasn't obvious to me and I thought I'd share the info!
5,If you are on a budget and want a good powered subwoofer I would recommend this Polk subwoofer every time. To get a better balanced bass I paired 2 of these together and it generates a very smooth and powerful bass. One thing that would make this subwoofer even better would be a remote control. Apart from that I am very pleased with it.
5,It’s not difficult to make the PSW-10 sound lousy. It will boom but it won’t sound musical unless you dial it in. There’s lots of info on Polk’s website that tells you how to connect and position the woofer. Also how to tweak those little dials in the back. It may not make a crapy system sound better but it really improved my system. I have an old Pioneer SA-6500 II amp and a pair of Boston Acoustic satellite speakers. The PSW-10’s 50 watt amp does all the work and lets my stereo amp relax and breath. I no longer have to boost the bass on the amp. I run it flat now with no bass or treble. The mid range comes through so much better now. Every thing sounds better. And I can hear bass now. Deep and full. I actually have to turn it down a bit or it over powers everything else. It does a good job filling a 30x12 foot room. Classical jazz rock bluegrass. It all sounds great! I Wouldn't use it in a room any larger though. All that and you can’t beat the price!
5,I order this subwoofer after my old one (Sony) stopped working.  Which was the perfect excuse to upgrade!  I am no audiophile but I do dabble.  I wanted something that was not too expensive but packed a punch.  I settled on this subwoofer and I am SO glad I did!It was a snap to install.  LOTS of great features to fine tune the subwoofer and worked well with my Yamaha receiver and existing surround sound speakers.They are powerful and it makes the entire house shake during heavy action parts of movies!  LOVE this subwoofer!  I would recommend trying these out to anyone looking to upgrade their subwoofer!
5,I have had my pioneer receiver for 25 years and never owned a powered subwoofer. To be honest I never could afford one. Until now. I truly thought I had heard everything this receiver could share. The very first note out of the system post hookup gave me chills! I finally have a complete surround setup. Buy one 100% recommend!
5,I bought the Sony 7.2 receiver to replace another receiver that had bought in the past before. Now with this PA-PSW10 10-inch monitor series powered subwoofer. it sounds amazing. I hear my lows in the bass. I am 100% happy with this SW. it also brings out the natural sound along with my four  Bose cube satellite speakers. Bose center channel speaker and two Bose 301 book shelf speakers as surround sound side speakers. as a matter of fact I am satisfied with the way I have my 7.2 sound system setup.my setup goes as follow:1-Bose center channel speaker2-Bose satellite main front speakers2- Bose 301 bookshelf speakers as my side surround speakers2- Bose satellite speakers as my rear surround sound speakers and lastly1-Polk audio 10" base which kicks out low soundsI do hope to add another PA 10" bass to my .1 of my 7.2 receiver to complete the 7.2. I don't know if I or my roommate can handle all that base. but for right now it is as it stands 7.1 sound. thanks PA for a great bass
5,Great subwoofer for the price.  Probably the best bang for your buck for a room smaller than 20x15.
5,I've seen this subwoofer on Amazon for over a year before I finally purchased it.  I am very happy with it.  I'm not an audiophile but I know good sound when I hear it.  I have a surround sound system with a Pioneer receiver and a Polk center channel with Bose and Sony speakers for the front and back respectively. Yes it's a mish-mash but adding the Polk subwoofer made the movies rumble just as I had hoped for.  I actually have it turned down much lower than I anticipated as the lows are incredible for this little unit.  If you are looking to add some bass to your system for not a lot of money I highly recommend this unit.  Polk products have been great for me and this one is no different.  Great subwoofer!
5,We all know sound is important to us and the mere thought of not being able to enjoy it is a violation. Whether it's video or audio. I myself like to get the full effects of the moment and without the proper bass level and clarity it's a boring experience. Not with this product. First the option to control the bass and volume is the cherry on the cake or sundae. Some companies don't offer that option and some never will so that is a major plus. Based on what kind of source you're watching or listening to adjusting the levels is key to a better experience ten fold. Which is why I gave a rating of 5 stars and I have no regrets on my purchase which also arrived promptly. Enjoy it. Peace.
5,I bought this to compliment a Yamaha sound bar. Polk has always made a good product and I wasn't disappointed with this sub-woofer. It's a breeze to set up and after some tweaking it makes a great addition to the sound bar. Bass is tight and it doesn't "boom" like some cheap subs do. It just makes good bass.
5,Polk is just my favorite speaker. And this is just the best deal on a sub you can get. I own the 12" too. And I prefer this. The 12" is just overkill and way to much footprint. The 10" will get the job done just as nicely and save you not only a lot of money but a lot of floor space. The only thing I don't like about this specific sub is it's black and all my Polk gear is Cherry. I love the Cherry cabs. But make no mistake about it this sub will rock your world. You will not be able to turn this baby up. Not and stay in the same room. Greatest value on a subwoofer you can get. If you need one this would be the one you want.
5,I was very impressed with the Polk Audio PSW10 10" Powered Subwoofer's bass definitely a must needed addition to any great home audio system for a steal of a price. The PSW10 has plenty of power with little to no distortion. The PSW10 will take good care of the low frequencies while the rest of your system is free to express and flourish reaching new heights.
5,I got this as a gift after I added it to my wish list.  I have the psw505 and have been blown away by its performance for the dollar so I assumed its little brother would hold up pretty well.  I didn't need much woofer power as I was just trying to beef up my main room system and this has certainly impressed me.  It isn't the tightest punchiest bass I have heard but for the 99 shipped with 2nd day (prime rocks) it is really an incredible woofer.  The only smaller woofer I had to compare with is a sony unit I used for the sonos in my master bath and this blows it away for roughly the same price.  If you are a looking to add a decent amount of punch to your home audio and don't need audiophile grade performance this could be the perfect one for you.  I have only had it for a few days so I don't have any reports on reliability but I have had great luck with the bigger Polk unit that I have.
2,I really wish I would have not bought this under powered 10" 50 watt powered sub!It produces a huge amount of front port noise that's just horrible during low bass music playback!I think this is the most over rated powered sub I have ever read about or owned. I can only guess that many of the 5 star reviews are due to this being the first powered subs that many people have purchased.Trust me the Dayton Audio 10" with a 100 watt amp and better driver blow this sub away! This Dayton 10" also has a (LFE) port that this Polk lacks and is also cheaper or the same cost as the Polk PSW10.Try the Dayton 10" or 12" and you will be very happy you did. I ended up selling my Polk  buying a Dayton Audio 12" that I have been using for several years with both my music only system and my Yamaha receiver for 7.2 surround sound in D.T.S. audio.Try the Dayton Audio powered subs. They have a bottom trumpet flared port that just about eliminates port noise and a 100 watt amp compared to the Polks 50 watt amp and front cardboard tube port that produces unreal amounts of port noise.Dayton Audio's new line of powered subs are in a class by themselves with great bottom flared ports and hefty 10 and 12" drivers that really deliver as well as 100 or 120 watt plate amps that have more than enough power to drive the subs.The Polk PSW10 just gets smoked as I had one and compared to two. Same go's for the older Polk 12" with it's 300 watt plate amp.I had my dads Polk 12" for well over a month and not only never needed to play it about the 50 Percent mark on it's volume control or if I did during testing it produced distortion and rear port noise thru it's rear thin slotted port.Notice the Polk 12" is on sale all the time for about $189 to $200 and has that old silver front which shows how dated this subs design really is. It's fine for home theater use but horrible for music as it's just too boomy and muddy at the 30HZ low end it can reach. The Dayton was not a sub I considered as I thought it was too cheap to be any good. I was talked into trying it out and could not believe it was better than the Polk.That old adage that you get what you pay for is simply not true in this instance as the Dayton 10" or 12" wins hands down!
4,This polk audio 10" subwoofer is best bang for your buck. I got two of these sucker's & they produce great bass to my polk audio home theater system. Highly recommended.
3,Pros:This was my first Subwoofer of its kind and Day-1 when I connected with my new Sony A/V Receiver and listened to a few Online 5.1 Dolby DTS ATOMS videos it blew my head. That was awesome experience. This was referred to me by a friend a great choice. I agreed to him after I noticed the combination of other 5 Speakers along with this.The Sound was really good with Good bass. We could hear the sound effect on the feet and Sofa. Terrific Sound. I used this now for little over 2 weeks and very impressive with Sound Effect and clarity.Cons:After all these Good experience I hate to mention that I found its Rubber Feet is not Strong. 2 of them broke. The Speaker is placed on a Plain Wooden Floor with No cartpet. The flow is very easy to move things and I dont remember moving the Subwoofer after installed on Day-1. I noticed 1 fell apart on Week 1 and second today.I wanted to talk to Customer Service understanding if they can guide on what could have gone wrong. He did understand and mentioned this could be some defective and please go ahead and return.I did not agree but with No other Options I have to make a choice to return it.Had the Feet been good I would have used this for many years.  Not sure if anyone else had same experience.
5,Works as expected
4,I brought this sub woofer  when it was $100 and now it is on sale for around $70 during the Black Friday sale.i received the speaker fast  and it was easy to setup and connect right out of the box. I wasn't looking for something complicated and all I had to do was to insert RCA cables and your done... There is a pass through option for if you need to run your front speakers through the woofer as well if needed.I had 5 speakers from my old system and just needed a woofer to complete the set.For the price that you pay it is a good speaker to get if you want some bass to complete a small theater room setup. It was recommended to place this in the front near the screen but it works better in the center rear.If you're looking for a high end sub woofer to shake the walls this isn't for you but if you're looking for something low cost to get the job done this sub woofer works.
5,I rarely write reviews but for this product I’m compelled. It’s a great unit.I bought it for a system I pieced together for a basement space: 20-year-old Onkyo receiver and 15-year-old Bose mini bookshelf speakers.  I bought the Polk sub primarily because of the price without high expectations. I can’t believe the sound.After a few months of happy listening I replaced my Bowers & Wilkins sub in my best system (Pioneer Elite receiver and B & W speakers all around) with the Polk sub for a drastic improvement. Loud quality bass without the boom.The B &W sub was many times the cost of the Polk.I’m about to order a second one. Anyone want a 2-year-old B & W?
5,I paired two Polk Monitor 40 Series 2 with this sub and OOFT what an improvement. I use it as a studio monitor as well and when I play the bass the walls vibrate. Pretty impressive for the price I have the volume on the back of the sub set about 2/3 and about 100hz lpf.
5,Ya había tenido una experiencia extraordinaria por casi 10 años con uno de Polk similar. Bajos profundos y claros sin embotar ninguna de las notas bajas. Una presentación preciosa. Lástima que no trae LFE. (He had already had an extraordinary experience for almost 10 years with a similar Polk. Deep and clear bass without dulling any of the low notes. A beautiful presentation. Too bad it doesn't bring LFE).
5,Right out of the box this sounds great! You will not be disappointed. It doesn't have an LFE input so hook up your sub cable directly to the RCA input (either one but I used the top.) Don't bother using a splitter it doesn't help the signal. Turn the low pass filter all the way up and you're good to go!
5,I am not a audiophile but I like to listen to good music and be able to hear the effects when watching a movie.  I purchased this and paired it up with quality speakers (in wall and ceiling) and a Denon amp for a 5:1 system and it sounds absolutely fantastic for the little money I spent.  Pretty sure if I had spent twice the money I maybe would get 10% improvement in sound but I am very happy with my purchase.Be sure to get the right sub cord.  They give three different connection methods in the instructions but the most common is not  very well outlined.  The sub line out from the amplifier to line in at the speaker is really simple in a single RCA connector configuration but it took me a minute because there are R and L line ins on the speaker.  Just put it to one or the other and turn the bypass all the way clockwise.
5,I had done away with my seldom used surround setup bought a good sound bar with sub for the new TV and was looking for a reasonably priced subwoofer for the living room receiver to replace my old harmon/kardon that had died. These days most of my music listening is done either in the car or via mp3 and earbuds so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a subwoofer that would only be used occasionally. The PSW10 is perfect for that role. Matthew Polk and his partners have been designing great affordable speakers for 40 years. I became familiar with Polk speakers in the 80's while working for a local electronics retailer. This puts out more than enough bass for our needs. We're not looking to rattle the windows. Hence the 5 stars for us. But if you're looking for something to thump you in the chest and alter your heartbeat look elsewhere. FYI I hooked it up using a Y-adapter as the PSW10 does not have a LFE input. And here's a shout out to Amazon my favorite shopping site. This would have cost me twice as much at the national big-box electronics store.
5,Puts a little bump in my music & movies. I already had the Polk Audio 5 speaker surround but my receiver/sub combo (different brand) went out & I really wanted to go with a Polk Audio sub because of my love for the other speakers. No regrets...all sound great together!
4,I am very pleased with the sub from Polk -- it was inexpensive and a great value. I had been waiting to add the sub as the final piece to our surround sound system for watching movies partly because of not wanting to spend the money and partly as I didn't know how much of a difference it would really make. Suffice it to say it was immediately noticeable.So if you are on the fence our experience is that the sub is a nice improvement for watching movies.  (Not exactly a great revelation I know...)  We don't have a big room but this is plenty for our needs and the auto on/off works fine. I can't compare it to other subs -- this is our first -- but for under a hundred bucks I can't imagine you can do much better. I have 2 rear speakers that are also Polk and they have worked very well and likewise have been a great value.
5,This subwoofer is amazing!!! I have it hooked up to my computer at work for music and IT IS LOUD!! The bass in amazing and SHARP!! I did a lot of research looking for a nice subwoofer that won’t break the bank and this is the one!! I’ll be buying a second one for the house.
5,Paired with a pair of Polk mid sized bookshelf speakers and AV receiver set at crossover frequency at 80 hertz on the receiver turned all the way up on sub (crossover frequency). Filtering handled by receiver for this. This is the same sub as Best Buy with a slightly different part number that is 50% more. For watching movies this sub really adds depth when paired with mid sized bookshelf speakers. Plenty deep enough. If you are looking for deep bass for movies to add depth this is it. If you are looking to feel sub frequencies you cannot hear this is not it. Great buy at this price. I have no reason to upgrade. The front grill is all black with a small Polk audio sticker at the bottom center looks nice.
5,Good lord fantastic low end. Looks great just like a piece of furniture. Powered is the way to go too. Doesn't sap the power from the stereo. I have 2 for my surround and the sound is so life-like that a pop from a digital fireplace made my daughter jump
4,Bass works extremely good.
5,I recently purchased this subwoofer along with the Onkyo TX8020 reciever and the Cerwin Vega VE5M bookshelf speakers.I am setting up a 2.1 system for strictly music listening in my house. I am very happy with this subwoofer. It has plenty of bass for a large family room. I can feel the bass upstairs even. You will be impressed by this subwoofer. I only have it about 1/2 volume for most of my music. The crossover is a nice feature. I have mine set about 90hz. I like how it self-powered which frees up my receiver to power the other bookshelf speakers. It was easy to set-up on my Onkyo receiver. The Onkyo has a great feature- subwoofer out rca jack. Just plug it in and you are good to go. You only need to connect the left or right line in on the subwoofer. No need for special splitter cables. The bass is clean and low on this sub. I have turned the volume all the way up and it still stays clean. I highly recommend the is sub. Its a great price imo.
5,I have a samsung 5.1 surround sound DVD player that has a non power sub with it. It was okay but it lacked what I was wanting. I got the Polk sub and it did what I was looking for. Now I have my Alexa dot connected to it and play some modern Hip Hop music and the Bass is very impressive. A very good upgrade. And the movies I play on the DVD is spectacular. It’s a decent upgrade I’m glad I did. Music and movies sound better than before. Even my classic rock sound better.
4,I like music to sound real balanced like I think the recording engineer recorded it.  I like rock and roll blues jazz some classical and ambient.  Forget hip hop.  I have a very nice pair of AR speakers and only needed a little boost on the bottom end.  This gives me all I need with volume turned way down. But I have just for fun cranked up my Jeff Beck Hiram Bullock and Robben Ford and you can hear bass all through my not so small house.  In other words whatever your taste in music I think this will fill the bill.  I'm very pleased.  4 stars only because sometimes it puts out no sound at all and I'm not sure if it's the speaker or my Sony AV receiver acting up.
5,Well when I bought this I expected it to be the same size as the woofers that came with most of the systems I have bought in the past. I had to laugh when I got it because it's like twice the size! I also had to buy a different cable to hook it up to my receiver but once I got it going I'm very happy with it.There is a dial on the back where you can turn the bass up or down to adjust it to exactly how you want it balanced with the other speakers. I love that! It can really pump out the bass I have it turned down past the halfway mark or it shakes the entire room (it's a small room).So for me it's a perfect addition to my home theater system.
5,I was a little worried about this speaker. I am putting in a home theater for a friend and he was under a budget. I had heard of Polk but always thought of them as being a mid grade speaker company. This speaker has really good depth and range for the price. It's not super high end but this can go toe-to-toe with even some of my speakers
5,Very surprising results from such an inexpensive sub woofer!Sub woofers can be quite overpriced in that they are strictly one-trick pony elements and when added to an inexpensive system theyprovide a nice rich filling out of the sound.This sub woofer has a nice clean sound not "boomy" and fills in wonderfully the Audio Engine a5 powered speakers at 1/3 the cost of the Audio Engine's sub woofer.It handles lots of volume and perhaps the only ones who will not like this are those who's taste in music means extreme bass or"bass head" style.  We needed something that could go from Dylan to Stravinsky choral rock pop acoustic and so on.Whether it is Stevie Wonder's "Superstition" or Paul McCartney's "Silly Love Songs" (both bass heavy) or full orchestra the Polk Audio PSW 10 does a nice job filling out the moderate sized living room.
4,It was a great addition to my surround system
5,My subwoofer died and I was looking to replace it.  You can spend a tremendous amount of money on a sub (which I really didn't want to do) and found this one for $129.  Don't be fooled it is a solid value for the money.  The newer model is $100 more and has basically the same specs.  If you are an audiophile you may notice the difference in more expensive models but for the basic home surround sound and music in a home it is a great buy.
5,Whoa. I was NOT expecting this kind of bass output from this size unit. Even with its volume knob only turned about 40 degrees its a pretty responsive unit and fills the listening area (typical townhouse basement) with a bass response that stays true to the music (meaning for ne that it doesn't overwhelm the other instruments or voice).Nice solid construction too.
4,I kinda just bought this one day on an impulse while upgrading the studio because i never really had a dedicated subwoofer for mixing in bass and what-not. So when it arrived i was a little taken back i have 12s in my trunk of my car so i know how big a 10" woofer is but the box on this is serious.PROS:-Hits very hard for 100w/10" woofer-Looks very clean (i have the black finish)-gain and freq cut off controls on the back are awesome perfect for keeping your bass where you want it.-Feels sturdy and well made.CONS:-Huge! i didnt expect this to be so large check the dimensions before you buy if youre concerned about space.-limited inputs make sure you have the cables/splitters/adapters required to plug it up on the spotIm very pleased with this buy and its price but i would recommend people who are looking to 'bass up' their sound to rearrange speakers and work on levels before buying this. For those looking for slumping basslines click add to cart now.
5,Love it! Recommended.
5,I have 2 of these. One in my rather large great room and one connected to my computer (which is way overkill).  Either one will shake my entire 3000 sq. ft. house if I'm watching a movie and movie theater volume levels. Can you get a better sub?  Absolutely. Will you pay a LOT more to get it?  Definitely. You'd have to spend at over double to do better when it's on sale for $99.
4,It's okay but I really did expect a better performance from this speaker. However it could be that I need to update my old Onkyo receiver from 1995. I have the bigger brother the psw505 with an Pioneer 1121k receiver and it sounds great with no rattling or distortion. This one is obviously not on par with that sub but I suspected it would do better since I use it for movies in a smaller room than the other. Again it may be my old receiver or it's half blown. Either way what does a 100 bucks get you anyways. I just need to try it with a more recent and better receiver then I will update. However for the extra 100 bucks of 200.00 total I would but the PSW505 Polk Sub in a heartbeat if I were to do over. That sub is genuine and worth every bit of the extra money.
5,Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer (Single Black)        This PSW-10 was purchased as a replacement for an old KLH 10" sub that wore out after years use. I did some extensive online and retail store research and came upon this item at Amazon and thought it would be worth the chance to try it for only $99.99 including s/h. I have paired this with my Yamaha RX-997 AV receiver and the sub easily handles movies music and games. I watched Battleship and the house shook during the explosions. I love how powerful efficient and inexpensive this sub is.Bottom line: I highly recommend this sub to anyone looking to enhance their home theater/music system.Side note: My wife did not know that I had set this up yet and she put on some streaming music of the R&B Classic genre. When she turned up the volume a bit to listen whilst doing some baking in the adjacent kitchen and she exclaimed "Where the heck is that deep bass coming from?" I showed her how to attenuate using the LFE setting and we are both happy.
5,Personally speaking this is the best $100.00 I have ever spent. I cannot believe how good the performance of this device is especially if you factor in bang for the buck! My system has built in the wall and ceiling Bose speakers. I bought a Denon AV receiver and everything sounded okay but missing the low end bass. I added the PSW10 and my home theater sounds amazing. The setup was easy using the left and right sub outputs of my 7.2 channel receiver into the left right RCA inputs of the PSW10. I read some reviews about this being low end and do not expect too much while I agree it is a low end product my expectations were completely shattered. Since I have 2 sub outputs I also wonder what 2 of these would sound like. I am completely satisfied and would buy this thing again and again. Way to go Polk Audio!
4,I bought this when it was on sale for about $95 at Amazon. At the current price it's still a good value.  Our theater room is about 14'x30' and it kicks out plenty of low frequency that can be felt in your chest.The directions and set up were simple (and I do advise reading them!).  I just had to make a few adjustments on my Yamaha receiver. You will need to have a good-quality RCA cable.The auto on-off switch works great.The only downside is the placement of the controls. Having them on the back makes it a bit difficult to make adjustments  - or at least it does in my installation.You will find that the sound quality/loudness will change a bit after the initial break-in period. All I had to do was turn down the output a bit.
5,Wow I initially purchased the Sony Subwoofer and decided to see if the Polk sounded better and I am not disappointed. The Polk sounds alot better and the bass is alot deeper and thumps amazing. Played music and a movie and wow. This subwoofer exceeded my expectations. I returned the Sony.
5,Surperb Sub-woofer awesome price.
4,You can add a 2nd if  you want more. At this price it is not the greatest bass in the world but in its price range it may well be.  One of these is not over whelming but it is nice and it is not  loose bass at all.
5,This sub is everything I expected.  Deep lows and very responsive.
5,I'm one of those guys who moved my living room entertainment center into a bedroom rental when I last moved and let me tell you this subwoofer has some power. I use it with an Onkyo Audio/Video receiver and aside from having to buy a long specialty cable (not sure what its called but looks like a mono RCA jack) it's been an excellent purchase. The dial on the back makes it easy to turn down late at night if needed but otherwise I let her roar and this baby pumps out some seriously low-lows during movie nights. I love it!
5,I have the very first Carver Sunfire subwoofer from years ago. It still works but is awful muddy. It is loud as all get out but not up to what it used to be. I really needed to replace it and didn't want to spend the cash I did on the Sunfire... so I went for this Sub. Luckily it was my birthday and someone bought it for me.  I live in a two story concrete house in Key Largo and the first day that I got it I turned it to medium - put some pretty bassy music on - and walked outside to make sure it wasn't too annoying for my neighbors. Well - this little sub made the upstairs (with glass doors / windows open) into it's own enclosure and you could seriously hear it outside. I have the volume on half and it does just fine. It isn't ultra low for audiophiles - but it is low enough for 99% of the general populous. Easy to hook up and sounds deep and rich. If you don't have a sub within your sound system then you are missing half the fun. Plus Call of Duty sounds soooo much better.
5,High quality value for the price
4,If you have a smaller room this is a fine subwoofer
5,Coming from a logitech z-4 2.1 system to this and a pair of Edifier R1850DB Active Bookshelf Speakers for my office computer sound system. This sub completely destroys the logitech subwoofer. It's not even in the same league. I had to move the hamster out of the office because everything was shaking. The adjustable phase amplitude and crossover are big wins. One of these is more than enough for a medium size room. Might be overkill for a small size room. Dont get this if you love in an apartment
5,I am currently using this sub to help out with the low end of my desktop computer speakers. I have/have had many different subs of all shapes sizes and purposes.  This sub serves its purpose very well for the low price tag.  It fills in the bottom end of my music games and movies very well. The volume knob and the adjustable crossover on the back come in very handy. Additionally the RCA inputs make it a breeze to fit into just about any system. It really is a great sub for a computer.I use a bigger and more powerful sub for my home theater system but I suspect that this sub could fill the role of a HT sub if you are on a budget.  You definitely won't get the chest pounding and floor shaking bass that you get in a movie theater but it will most definitely add life to explosions in your movies. I should also note that the front porting(which is fairly rare on subs in this price range) makes it a great choice if it will be sitting up against a wall or in a corner.
5,We've had this for over a year now.  Great thumper that adds awesome sound quality to our music or theater experience.It's a "must have" to round out your Polk Speaker Sound System.I would only recommend this for a house owner.  Any shared walls those neighbors will hate you
4,I rarely hand out 5 stars so 4 of them is high praise from me. It seamlessly integrated into my livingroom set up and I had two spend all of 15 min dialing it in. Lots of rich deep bass and it does not rattle when explosions or other loud noises happen while watching tv or movies. I got a sale for $99.00 and I am very happy. Recommended
5,I looked at this sub at a local furniture store (RC Willeys). The salesman recommended it and said it was a great sub for the price ($299.00) after looking around Amazon has the best price so I ordered it. I have had it for about a week and I am very impressed. I have paired this with a set of in wall surround sound speakers and a Onkyo TX-SR607 receiver. Gives good clear bass almost all the time. In some instances I have modified the settings from the receiver to fit the listening mode ie-Music/Movie/Game. I think the key to this subwoofer is having a receiver with good signal output and equalizer controls etc. I have this set up in a very large vaulted great room and it fills the entire room with good bass sound. I think the bad reviews on this product are most likely coming from either 1. The people that complain all the time because they are complainers or 2. The people that think a nice powered subwoofer is going to somehow increase the low quality of their receiver! Unless you are an super audio aficionado I say go for this sub! Cant beat the price...besides you can always find someone to pawn it off on if you decide to drop $500 plus on a ultra high end sub!
5,have this 7.1 onkyo system and my first sub had a weird vibration..something was wrong..it was old...someone gave me another cuz i really didnt wanna spend 100 on just a sub...but that one only worked sometime...im glad i ended up not going to buy a used one..for $130 id say this is a solid value. i finally get a full sound from this very nice movie theater room. carpeted so preferred a front/side firing sub.
2,I was hesitant to purchase this sub due to a lack of success with Polk products in the past; however it's hard to argue with nearly 4000 5-star reviews. And for the price - it seemed foolish of me not to give them another try. I was VERY happy with the sound of this sub and the amount of bass it provided! That is for a grand total of one day; then during the middle of the night while asleep with earplugs in I awoke to what I truly believed was my ceiling about to cave in and figured it was a massive earthquake. I freaked the hell out! I ripped out my earplugs and was frantically trying to figure out where this ungodly sound was coming from. It was deafening! I was shocked upon discovering that it was coming from the sub. I figured it was a bad RCA connection so I wiggled them around a bit until it went away. Hours later here it was again. I was extremely upset from being awoken twice to what sounded like a tornado and immediately got up turned off the receiver and unplugged the RCA's. The next day it worked fine - for a few songs but then that noise started to reappear. Again I unplugged the RCA's and turned off the receiver. That night for the third time I awoke to the same noise - and realized that nothing was plugged into it and the levels were both at zero/minimum. The only thing left to do was to unplug it from its power source. Once again jacked by a company that's known for good products. Just not when it comes to me.Also look up "PSW10" and "port noise" if you're interested in buying this product. Even though it wasn't the issue I was having it's a common problem. And I forgot to add that the shaking was so violent that it shattered one of the pegs into pieces.
5,I usually don't write reviews on products that already have tons of reviews however I am so impressed by this woofer that I must write something. I have it hooked up to my Sony Bluray BVD E580 home theater system in my bedroom. The subwoofer that comes with it is far from impressive so I bought this woofer to fill in the much needed bass. I didn't expect much from the PSW10 since it was under $100. I took it out of the box hooked it up using the line in input and tested it out. OMG! At 50% it was too powerful for my room. Currently I have it at 10% maybe and it sounds great. This is the 3rd powered sub I have owned. The other two are more high end so I will not compare this one to them but it sounds as clean as my other two. My master bedroom is very large so I have no doubt this woofer will perform in most settings.
2,I think people are really stuck on the price on this one.  Don't get me wrong it's a good price but you get what you pay for.As far as powered 10" subs that deliver a good base tone it's passable minimally.  I have another 10" powered sub on another system and yes it was 5x the price but the sound between the two stand in very stark and obvious contrast.The sound on this one isn't what I'd call "crisp."  Yes you can think of crisp as being the mid-range tones but it seems like this projects bass without purpose. It sounds confused and muddy.It also has some quality issues.  For me at least the volume is only usable up to about the halfway point...other than that it booms and vibrates and makes noise but it's just deep bassy noise not a clear base tone.  Additionally the port in the front has a sharp edge on the inside all the way around the circumference- basically where the outer cover meets the box.  When the baselines are strong the air moving over this shape piece causes a rattling snappy raspy sound.  Think about the noise you can make when blowing strongly over a glass coke bottle that howly sound.  This is the same but because the edge is sharp it's a much sharper sound....sounds almost like a brief and sharp rattle....which has the same effect- messing up your bass tones.I'm still deciding on whether or not this is going to get sent back.  On one hand I don't expect my issues to be resolved by a new unit because it's a quality issue inherent to the design.  On the other hand if I spend a little more I can get a much much better subwoofer.On a smaller system in a smaller room where you don't need overwhelming bass tones it's hard to ignore this subwoofer- you really can't beat it for the price.For big loud clear bass in a larger room where big sound is needed.....you're better off spending a little more.
5,I did receive a bad one initially and that was a pain to troubleshoot as it worked just enough to have me blaming an already troublesome AVR. It ships in just the factory box and I wonder if they get bounced around a lot in transit. Amazon does make returns a breeze though so after a short delay I had a replacement. My old sub died months ago and I forgot how much I need one! This thing really sounds great with my new Onkyo AVR and Infinity satellites. My old Boston Acoustics sub was awesome as well but cost me 7 times as much over a decade ago. I use the Polk for Spotify concert DVD's and movies and it really performs well for all. Surely my new AVR is a big part of it but this sub should easily do the job for most people. I love spending so little and getting so much!
4,Awesome. So why only 4 starts? Because I should’ve gotten the 300 watt SW by Polk. The bass is more than adequate as I have a medium sized living room but with 14 ft ceilings . But once you get a taste you want more. I have this paired with the Edifier powered monitors.  The total system price? $300.  You can’t do better for the price and rush don’t procrastinate to get this subwoofer.  A higher output with the adjustment knob can render it a little boomy but this depends on room acoustics. If in a basement where the floor is solid it would be tighter. Having it on my second floor floor it can be a little overpowering. But for south of $90 it’s a steal.
5,Volume set at 50%.  Works best if connected directly to sub out port on amplifier with no speakers connected from sub woofer.
5,I purchased this to replace an 8 inch NHT sub with external power amplifier after it started giving me trouble and I am extremely impressed. Set up was a breeze just plug in the input and the power then you're good to go. With the volume on the back set just below half (I modify volume from my preamp) this unit shakes the walls ceiling and floor with electronic or hip hop but also blends in perfectly to fill in that bottom register in more orchestral sound arrangements. It even sounds great while playing movies for example Smaug's voice in The Hobbit 2 sounds exactly like it did in the theater.  Many people have complained about port noise being distracting but in my experience I haven't heard anything besides good clean bass. Bottom line this unit performs well in every area that I use speakers for and exceeds expectations in high and low volume settings. Couldn't be happier and can't see why I waited so long to pull the trigger on this one.
5,This the best sub. easy to hook up and it makes movies come to life. Don't get if you not really ready to feel your movies or music. I love it!!!!!
5,If you are looking for a budget or a first setup the PSW10 would be a great.Pro:Made very well.Cheap but offer sound comparable to subs 1.5x the price.Aesthetically pleasing.Powered Sub (Which is a pro since this is aimed at a budget system so no worries about powering the sub with a amp/built-in)Front-firedOther things I noticed:Size? It is quite large for a 10in sub but it means it also has a lot of space to resonate. Make sure to measure your living room/dorm/etc.I am a college student hat wanted a budget 2.1 sound system for the dorms and when I live off campus in the future.I currently have a Lepai amp + Dayton speakers + PSW10 sub + Monoprice 16 gauge copper speaker wire (I recommend copper not just aluminum clad speaker wires.)This sub is serving me well. I cant even blast it to 100% since it gets too loud.ALSO look for the price drops I bought this when it hit $70 usually price is $100-$110
5,This sub is awesome.. i added it to my TV with a vizio soundbar and it shakes the house at half volume tuned at 90mhz lpf. Id say its worth the money if you want more boom for your TV
4,With the price dropping down to $80 occasionally it's impossible to not recommend this subwoofer at this price especially if it's by a big name like Polk Audio. At 50 watts you maybe disinclined to try it but it sounds much bigger than you would think. However one caveat is the PSW10's frequency response only goes to about 35hz. While that is abundanly acceptable for most music in movies you lose much of the low rumbles that you may want in a home theater. This is a rather musical subwoofer at least and it blends well with satellite speakers. I highly recommend this subwoofer as it is easily the best subwoofer you can buy under $100. Ignore brands like Acoustic Audio and Theater Solutions. They can't compare to this 26 pound budget champ.
5,This thing sounds really good for money. Best bang for the buck! I mostly use it in the garage while listening to music. Fills in the lows I was missing from my stereo. Definitely recommend
5,I knew it!  This replaced my 10yo 250W JBL and this is more than enough... the difference is this Sub was 1/3 the price of my JBL also... it truly is just as good and the room is big too!  I'm not sure what you really need 250W for but I think they are making these much more efficient than they used to be or maybe just all around better.  You will not be dissapointed at all on this product also it has a feature of: on off and standby and that was precisely the problem I had with my last one it couldn't figure out if it wanted to be on or off at low and mid range outputs... I think the way this Sub is set up I'll never have that problem of course I was crafty on how I hooked it up... I have it set on "ON" all the time but it only get's power when the Receiver is on... so it knows to be on not in between like it may do if I set it on Standby.
5,I have been using this sub with my Denon AVR 2112ci receiver and it is awesome. It has produced incredible bass for music from rock to rap and classical. It has a cutover and volume switch on the back so you can make precise adjustments about the cutover frequency the sub handles and also the volume. The bass is incredible especially at the price. For $99 I expected it to be OK but it is awesome couldn't be happier with this purchase. I definitely recommend it without hesitation.
5,UPDATE: had this subwoofer for a few weeks now. Make adjustments appropriately. DO NOT put volume level at full blast. You don't it that high. Mine is about 30-35%. Whatever Polk did to this speaker it literally sounds like a solid 12" subwoofer. It is absolutely worth every single penny. Best invest for a non super high end home theater set up.This thing seriously pumps some bass out. Decided to see how Die Hard in DTS (5 star dvd collection) did with this bad boy. One word: wow. For the price best decision for an average home theater nerd. Need to boost the low end of your home theater? Look no further. Just make sure anything loose doesn't rattle & fall to the floor & breaking.
5,I had A JBL for years. It stopped workingso I was looking for a replacement. Did not have the money for a new JBL so a friend told me about The Polk Audio so I thought I would try it and I am happy I did.I have it on a pioneer amp and 901 Bose the bass is great and the volume is good also.
5,So our bedroom is right above the garage the room our toddler naps in btw. Purchased this as a gift for my husband to add to his system massive mistake for me! The bass is deep great sound quality have had a napless boy way too many times now even when he turns it way down you can feel it. Pretty sure our neighbors hate us now. Other than that it's great- easy to hook up great sound in a 60 × 100 room decent price.
5,I've had a surround sound system for a few years but never bought a sub-woofer. I finally decided to buy one for myself this Christmas and boy was I surprised. The sounds and vibrations this thing creates is sometimes too much. I live on the top floor of my apartment building and I feel bad for the neighbors downstairs. This thing shakes the floor when I have the volume turned halfway up. I'm scared to turn it anymore for fear that I might get complaints. I know a lot about video but not that much about sound. After having this sub-woofer for a week I can say that this speaker would be a very good addition to anyone looking to a sub-woofer to their home theater system.The only complaint that I really have is that there's no remote volume control for the sub-woofer. Depending on what I'm watching the sound levels may be different. My XBox produces way more bass sounds than TV so when I'm switching to one or the other I have to go to the back of the sub-woofer to adjust the volume. The sound that this thing produces is well worth it though.
5,I bought 2 polk audio psw10  have a a denon  receiver avr  s900w  and cerwin vaga  speakers...4 -8inch surround with center speaker  and 15inch sub 400rms I need more punch for some action movies.. I had all the lows I needed .. so I bought one ..it did good .. if you new me I wanted more I always over do stuff so I bought another one. so I put the 15 inch in the front and the 2 polk in the back where my coach is and holly cow I love it!!!!!!!! it puts out good punchy bass for being only 50 watts rms .I  WAS SUPRISE ..I would tell everyone go for it ..like I said ..it was good just with one but I over do it everytime ..but that me .. and that's why im single lmao ..AND TO LET YOU KNOW I BOUGHT MY FIRST ONE FOR 129.00 AND MY SEC ONE I PAID 99.00
4,It is a good product but it took me several months to figure out how the power switch worked. It has a three position switch where the down position is off and the light will turn red. The upper position is the on position and the middle position is the on standby position where after 15 minutes it will go into standby mode and the light will turn red after 15 minutes. It is hard to see the switch and confusing to read. I thought the upper position was the auto standby because the way it was printed next to the switch. I was thinking I had a defective unit because of the confusing printing near the switch. It is a good product and I would recommend it.
5,The performance is more then I had expected and the construction quality is definitely of high standard.  It is larger then I had expected however the sound more then makes up bulk.  It works great with other brands of speakers but I have been slowly replacing my out dated speakers with Polk Audio and the sound just keeping getting better.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to add to their existing sound system.
5,I received this subwoofer with in one day rather than the standard two days shipping for Prime members which was great. Last week I bought PSW108 from the local BestBuy and was planning to settle. Then I read about PSW10 and specifications seem to have no difference. In one of the discussion forums I saw a comment on one person calling a Polk CSR and CSR mentioning some sonic enhancements in PSW108. Then I went to Polk website and I could not find PSW108 there. Since the price difference between the two models is $70 (yes BestBuy sells PSW108 at $199) I opted for PSW10 and I see no difference for my regular music in my small apartment. This buy was well worth.It came packaged nicely and it had a better user manual than PSW108. I used the crossover setting to 90Hz (as my front speakers' lowest was 60Hz) and it sounded really good. I use a 2.0 Yamaha receiver and speaker in/out at the back of the subwoofer.
5,This is a great subwoofer. Let me tell you why I think so.I recently purchased a Rotel 1055 receiver and vintage Bose 501 speakers in attempt to build a quality system I could appreciate for a while till I was prepared to take the next step (previous system was Logitech Z-5500 [yea yuck]). I hooked the system up and played it for a couple months. I like my music how I like my women..with a full bottom and the Bose 501s alone weren't getting me there. Enter the Polk Audio PSW10.The box was kinda light when it arrived and that worried me. I was scared of ending up with anything that resembled the Logitech in build or sound quality. However once I got it hooked up and configured properly (emphasize properly) it exceeded my expectations very pleasingly. The lows are there and the punch is there. I listen to a very wide variety of music and this subwoofer doesn't disappoint in any area of the spectrum for this price range.Like I previously stated if you're considering this subwoofer you will not be disappointed.
5,Good size and clear sounds. Meets expectations.
5,Performs as expected. Bought to enhance Polk T50 speakers. Blends in around 33% output on gain. Bought for front port to position next to main speakers and has had positive reviews.
5,I have a 7.2 system with an 8" Yamaha sub and I really enjoy the sub sound.  But I decided that I wanted to upgrade to this 10" and I am glad I did.  There is a very big difference when watching movies! The 8" sub had a distorted thump but this sub has a solid bass sound with no distortion.  I like the fact there are individual controls on the back as well.  I first just hooked up the "L" to the sub out on my receiver and it sounded good.  I then bought a "y" cord to connected both the R and L to my receiver.  This made a noticeable difference at higher volumes.  I strongly suggest spending $10 to buy a male to double-female y cord (the male end goes into your sub out on your receiver).
4,Does the job. Sounds good and relatively easy to set up. Is it perfect? I honestly don't know. I don't have high quality source material and I can't crank it up - small room and sensitive neighbors. But I needed a sub-woofer to pair with my tiny desktop speakers.Gripes? It's a lot larger than I expected. It probably has to be in order to function well with a 10-inch speaker. But in my small office it takes a fair amount of room. But at least it fits under my desk out of sight. There are several "controls" that need adjusting - crossover / phasing / auto on-off / and of course volume. Possibly because I'm not making many demands on sound / quality / quantity I don't see much difference. Volume of course is straight-forward but even then I am never quite sure I have it set optimally.
4,If you are looking for a great sub for a low price look no further! After much contemplation I bought the PSW-10 when it was on sale for $89. This sub is easily worth $200. The bass is clean accurate and it gets surprisingly low. I'm no audiophile but I have a very good knowledge of speakers and their workings. This may only be rated at 50 watts rms but it sounds and feels like much more at least 150 watts in my opinion. I will say there is a bit of port turbulence once you turn it up about half-way. I solved by loosing stuffing a wash cloth in the port and keeping the cut off at 100Hz. Even so you wont be turning it up half way much because it gets LOUD for its size. I live in a college dorm and when I turn it up half way people across the building can hear the bass. This subwoofer is well worth the buy.
5,So far I can't complain. I've been a big fan of Polk speaker value for over 25 years so I'm not surprised this unit has completely lived up to my expectations. I purchased it to replace a dead sub from an old Cambridge Soundworks speaker system and it fits in perfectly. The adjustable volume and crossover allow me tune it to my satisfaction and the bass is full bodied but never boomy.Given the size of the room it serves duty in I wish the cabinet was a little smaller but that a nit pick.Another nit pick the speaker grill is a little cheap looking and I'm hoping it will stand up to the occasional bump while careless teenagers are doing chores like vacuuming. But for under $100 the overall value is quite high.
5,I have nothing but praise for the Polk PSW10. I got it to compliment my Polk T15 speakers in my bookshelf audio system. What a combination! Great accurate sound natural bass (NOT fake booming). I don't like it when speakers are described as "Good for the price" because that implies a compromise. There is no compromise on the accuracy and clarity of the sound of these speakers. They are a bargain.
5,50 Watt output matches my KRK GS 5 output so a very balanced sound.  I couldn't be more pleased with the quality
5,Got this for an addition to my Vizio Soundbar since it has a Sub Out and it sounds AMAZING. I have the bass set at about halfway and this thing is powerful! You can really feel it has good range to it... Deep thundering bass. Probably the best subwoofer I've ever had. You could definitely throw a party with this thing! I'm a big fan of bass and listening to music without it makes me sad like something's missing. You won't be disappointed with this thing. Works just perfect with my soundbar too which saves me a ton of money because I can just avoid buying an expensive receiver. It also LOOKS really cool. I just like the aesthetic of it.
5,Hooked it up to a Sony 5.2 and ran its receivable surrounded sound lines into it and the neighbor who’s house is fifty nine feet away complained of the noise. That’s a win in my book.
5,I have a small living room 12x16.  I had a small in wall 8 in one sub in the front right corner.  It just want doing it.  I put this in the back left corner.  It is amazing.  Much better in the lower frequencies.  This isn't going to hit hard like a 12 but I use it for watching movies not rattling the neighbors windows.  Great for your average home DIYer.  Not high end audio but not high end price either.
4,Got one for a larger great room but then opted for a Klipsch R-12SW instead since it was a 12" subwoofer and on sale for $60 off at Costco for $189.  However if you need something more compact and not quite so much power don't pass this up when it's at a good price.
5,This works amazing deep lows at half volume set at 10 olclock on hertz from the back view. I am totally  surprised. For the price at 76.00 dollars like new as advertised  it’s new to me perfect condition ship excellent!! (99.00 dollars new)  The lows are exceptional for the money. I’ve been studying Martin logon SVS HSU I will eventually get one but for now this is a great buy and sounds amazing!! Trust me you won’t be disappointed. I am a audiophile dude and think this is a great buy if your getting hooked like me with speakers. It will satisfy you til you save up for your high end speakers. Again Trust me you won’t be disappointed. Get the y-splitter for your connection only thing they don’t tell you.
1,I bought this along with 7 Polk in-wall speakers 5-months ago while my basement was being renovated.  Due to construction delays I’m just now setting everything up.The sub didn’t seem to work so I called Polk tech support during their 6-hour window M-F…I get it I t’s hard to find help right now.The tech support person was friendly with a thick accent. She walked through a couple of things with me then said that it will need to go to a service center. I asked how thin worked. She explained that I would have to pay to ship it to the service center…what!? It’s brand new and failed out of the box and I have to PAY to fix it? She confirmed that was correct. I can’t even imagine how long that process might take.When I protested she said she’d escalate it to her manager…which would call me back in 24-48 hours…😔Polk Audio has always been known as a premium brand even as they’ve grown into mass-production. I used to sell home audio and was always comfortable steering people to Polk.This is where brands go to die a slow death. I can only hope someone who cares will read one of my complaints on here or social media and take care of the situation. If not I can assure you that these will be my last Polk audio purchases. Sad.
5,I bought this to fill out the sound from my small Polk Audio Monitor 40 Series II (https://amzn.to/3fGRm4R).  The combination fills my office with a great sounding system for not a lot of money.  It took a little time to dial in the levels for the sub woofer.  Now that it's set I can fire up Amazon Music and know what ever I choose is going to sounds great.
5,Super fast AMAZON shipping ! 1 day !! Extremely simple hook up nicely laid out rear panel with switch and knob placement. Straight forward design looks good with the grill on or off . Great looking cabinet all this with admiral performance and the base volume will be sure to please even the “crazy ones” that have to blast it to make the wall art go  crooked.
5,First things first - this is a BEAST.  I was not really prepared for its volume size-wise... for some reason I thought the photo made it seem like more of an 8" sub box but it is the real deal 10"...and the box to go with it.But then when you move past the issue of 'where do I put this thing?' you set it up and it is HUGE when it comes to sound.  It challenges my 3x more expensive Polk for clarity depth and sheer sound power.If you just need a sub for music or home theater and don't want to pay audiophile prices for huge sound do yourself a favor and get this one.
5,If you are looking for good bass at a reasonable price this is the product for you.
3,Poor sound quality. Fealt cheap in comparison to other products from the same company. I had a buzz coming from the amplifier. I went ahead and returned the item. I still run all Polk audio speakers As my main speakers for sound quality
4,Sometimesfor some reason the Sub does not came on when you turn the TV on.. not sure I've revised all cables and connectors all seems to be fine. Anyway.
5,I think it is better at rumbly bass maybe for a theatre more so than purely for music listening. It can literally rattle my whole house so it has plenty of power but could maybe be more punchy/tight. I am going to try getting an isolation stand to see if that improves the sound. For the price it is amazing and I am very happy with the sound quality it provides alongside my powered bookshelf speakers.
4,Not an audiophile.I have 3 of these. 2 in my living room and 1 in my garage. They fill low end nicely. If they had a 15 in version. I would have gotten those though.
4,Very easy to set up. Nice and big(that's what she said)... Really no joke she loved how it sounds.lol
5,make sure you buy this here as it costs double at some big electronic stores. prime 2 day shipping is awesome for things like this. i hooked the sub up and fooled around a little bit until i got it where i want it. it can definitely put out some noise but it takes a little finagling to find a good zone for you personally. it was too boomy at first but i changed around the crossover and got it set where i wanted. i have two tower speakers that i set to small (highly recommend if you want to get better sound) and cut off at 80hz center channel cut off at 110hz and the sub comes in at the 80hz. i maxed out the knob on the sub to 120hz because my receiver will take care of the crossover. after that it's just adjusting the volume to a level you're comfortable with. some movies i like to turn it up some but for general tv watching and non-action/non-epic movies i leave it around mid-volume with a -6 decibel setting on my receiver.
5,This sub blew me away! Goes hard in music and great for tv and movies. Super great with my custom towers with Skar audios 8” mids and 4 inch super tweets! No port noise even playing below 30 hz which was my main concern was port noise. But does distort at higher volumes that low which was expected for the price but still gets down and dirty. I would definitely go out and buy this sub again if mine got ruined some how. Has plenty of output and adjustability. Also don’t just need one rca wire to play if your reviver is super old like mine and only has one output. Just need the red input Incase anyone was wondering. GREAT BUDGET SUB FOR THE HOUSE!
5,If you're an audiophile you probably won't want this sub but then again you're probably not looking at this sub or my review of it. If you're an average person who wants to fill in the base where your bookshelf speakers or sound bar just can't reach consider this sub. Includes a crossover frequency selection volume control automatic on/off based on signal input manual on/off and two types of inputs. For the price it's the best I've seen or heard. I use mine on the stereo in my garage and it's perfect for me.Caveat: I'm 65 yrs old so my high-frequency hearing is not as good as a 20 yr old but I lows are OK and I don't need a hearing aid.
4,Matched up with a pair of cheap $100 pair Polk T-15's and a $150 Yamaha R-S202 receiver in a 24'x24'man cave. Close enough to top end fidelity sound for me after a couple beers.
5,Had a old woofer that eventually died. Bought as a replacement and it sounds great for the lows during movies
5,I cannot say this is the best bass I’ve ever heard/felt but I can say it is the very best bass I’ve ever experienced for the money. It is perfect for an apartment or small to medium sized home theater. The low pass has a wide range although I didn’t find it necessary to turn it up more than a quarter of the way. I’m sure if you live in a free standing home or townhouse basement you could probably really crank it up.
5,Installed this in my home theater and it's great.  It can be tuned to give just the right amount of bass without blowing you out of the room or making chairs creep across the floor.  Yeah I know some people really like that much bass but for me I just want the full-bodied sound that allows an orchestra to sound great or a movie to fill the room with action without pummeling the audience.  It's not huge so most people can find a place for it.  It has an attractive cabinet so it's not ugly if you can't hide it.  It automatically turns itself on and off so it's pretty much a set-it-and-forget-it piece of equipment.  I've lived a long time without one of these but now that I have it I don't know how I got along without it for so long.
3,I'm becoming a bit more of an audiophile I admit it.  I should have taken more warning from the reviews online but decided that for $90 how could I miss?  In actuality it's a great sub for the money but has it's shortcomings.  This sub really fills in nicely for my type of music (rock alternative maybe some rap).  I don't listen to it at full volume because I want a good bass/treble balance.  This sub could break your windows out but it will have that "boomy" sound while doing it.When watching movies I have found that this sub struggles to keep up.  it's not necessarily the sub's fault.  It's just that movie producers don't pay that much attention to sound quality when creating a film hence lower quality sound.  If you're just looking for something to fill in the low end for your otherwise lacking speakers for playing music at lower-than-bleeding-ear volumes this will do fine.  If you are going to be super demanding with music AND movies try something like the Polk 505.  I haven't listened to it myself but have read that it's good for about twice the price.* Post Edit - I have since bought the Polk Audio Monitor 75t and CS2 set up.  They are wonderful speakers.  Essentially the 75t towers are highly comparable to the TSI500 or Monitor 70 line.  These upgraded speakers seem to completely outmatch the Polk PSW10.  I can't recommend the combo per the subwoofer is so completely overwhelmed by the towers' ability to hit lower frequency ranges.  The subwoofer is left with very little frequency range to cover on its own.
5,I was considering ordering a different Subwoofer a larger one and I am glad I didn't!  Got this one on sale for $79 w/free shipping.  I kept going back and forth and finally decided with the other reviews that I just couldn't pass up on this deal.  I am very satisfied with my decision.  It outputs a very clean deep base if needed.  I am not a hip hop listener when it comes to music.  I enjoy good clean bass that is not overwhelming and this one does not disappoint.  Watching Blu-Rays has never been more fun.  I've even started redoing my music collection just to listen to things I haven't heard before with older stereos.  I recently upgraded by 6.1 Onkyo HTIB to the following setup:Yamaha RX-V373 5.1-Channel AV Receiver $250Sony SS-F6000 Floorstanding 4-Way Speakers $157Polk Audio CS10 Center Channel Speaker $110Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer $79Polk Audio Monitor series II AM3095-A Rear Surround $120Sony PS3Samsung 46" LED Smart TV
5,Love this Polk Audio Subwoofer. I saw the movie Tom Clancy's "Without Remorse" and the sound effects  were better than going to the movie. The trembling in the room from the bass was awesome. Totally recommend paying the price for this subwoofer.
5,I had the larger version of this sub and I never had it above 30% volume. The larger one went out on me and I wanted to replace it. I was hesitant in the quality of this sub but I can tell no difference in quality of the 12" sub. Would recommend if you are putting it in a room in your house that is any size.
5,Very Happy with this purchase! I bought it to replace my Samsung home surround sound system. And this has delivered more than what I wanted! If you are like me and wanted a little bit more bass and don't want to break the bank this is for you! I can't run it full blast! But it is very convenient to turn down the volume on the back of the speaker and adjust it accordingly.
5,I was able to get this when it was on sale for about $90 and it is definitely worth every dollar. I've impressed quite a few friends just having this as part of my sound system and that's not why I bought it - I wanted to hear music and games and sounds the way they were produced. Absolutely wonderful - reaches all the way down to near the lower limit of audible sound for humans and still sounds good. As with any driver of a particular size some frequencies are slightly more pronounced than others but it really doesn't detract from the sound with music and with movies and games hands down this is all you'll need unless you're building a home theater or something. Even there it'd perform well. Let me just say if you have it on automatic mode (turns on when it senses a signal); when it kicks in it's a good feeling :D
5,“OUTSTANDING SUBB @ A AFFORDABLE PRICE “.  This is a SOLID HEAVYWEIGHT in SOUND QUALITY AND WELL BUILT.”  I Barely have to Raise the Volume on this Beautiful Subwoofer “!! Precise thump & Integration .  But IMPORTANT TO USE THE RED & White inputs on Sub . You will need a  RCA Splitter For BEST Accurate Sound “!!  BANG 4 BUCK 4 SURE “!! Sounds Quality “!!
5,bought mine in 2011 and still going strong. blends excellently with a pair of primus 160. can't believe such an inexpensive sub can sound so musical. i don't like boomy bass in my music just dial around one third of the volume knob and gives all the bass my music needs and then some. for some of my cd's one third of the volume is too high.the primus 160 are rated to go down to 49 hz but they struggle to deliver clean bass that low. that's where the polk sub comes to the rescue. the low pass filter begins at 80 hz and that's where i have it so the primus's woofers don't have to play notes lower than 80 hz notes that tax them and make it harder for them to play clearly up to 200 or 300 hz.a must for music if your bookshelf spkrs aren't that great at low frequencies.
4,For the price really sounds good.  I will only say its range doesn't go quite as high as I'd hope but the low frequency sounds are fantastic and its clearly sturdy and well made there isnt a hint of any loose shaking or rattling.
5,Very clean and clear bass  nice rumble you can really feel it throughout your body just don't over power it as it will get distorted serves a mid size room very well would suggest getting two for a large room
5,Wow! I upgraded my my receiver and decided to replace my aging subwoofer as well. Since my new receiver supports 2 subs I decided to order 2 Polk 10" subwoofers. I had no idea what I've been missing. The range on these are incredible! The thunder rumbles explosions really boom and even non action movies benefit from the bass in the soundtrack! I am in love with these subs and can't give a higher recommendation you won't be disappointed!
4,I didn't need something that will rattles the walls but this little puppy in combination with the excellent acoustics of the lower level of my home is quite astounding for 50 watts and can do just that. Lost my original sub in a flood about 5 1/2 years ago have lived in an apartment since then knew I could never really enjoy a sub living there. *Flash forward to the present*. I recently bought a bi-level home and the first thing I did was purchase this Polk subwoofer. I'm running an Onkyo TS-DX484 (yes circa 2001. It's been a workhorse) 500 watt Home theater system original Onkyo center & rear surrounds(meh) JBL fronts. Music sounds great movies are great. I'm not an audiophile or snob but I'm a musician and I've played in local bands since I was 14 (now 51) so I do know what sounds good. This Polk sub does the job for me.
5,I use this on my porch when I BBQ or jam outside with my Yamaha RS-202BL . I bring it in when I'm done of course but when I use it it really jams.
5,I bought this one to use with an old stereo that doesn't have a subwoofer output and it's great for this since it has speaker-level inputs and outputs so you can just wire this unit inline with the speakers if you need to.  I also have a Pioneer subwoofer for my newer stereo and that one does not have these types of connections so I couldn't use that model in this situation.  Anyway this Polk unit sounds great and puts out a lot of bass.  It has a volume adjustment so you can set it at whatever level you like.  My stereo has switched AC outlets on the back so I plugged it in there so it only comes on when the stereo comes on and that works nicely.  The unit is quite large so make sure you have space for it.  The price was reasonable and the free shipping was great for this as it's heavy and probably was expensive to ship so this was another nice Amazon deal.
5,I use this sub in my home-theater/low-spec hifi setup and it hits every mark I care about. It's easy to set up (Sub out from receiver-->RCA to sub in) and offers quite a bit of control. I kept most of my settings in the middle and the balance is great. It's built very well so I'm not worried about longevity. Bass tone is clean and punchy without ever getting muddy. If you're looking for a sure-fire solution for your home theater get the Polk PSW10.
5,Very nice sub bang for the buck is exceptional. $79 on Amazon on sale no regrets. Read the other reviews and the manual:1. just hook up the single decent quality sub RCA cable(no need for a Y-connector)2. Volume at 50%3. Low pass all the way down (don't need muddy mid-bass messing things up it sounds best using just as an 'enhancement' sub for low end used in conjunction with quality speakers. If you just want major boom and obnoxious volume maybe this isn't for you (but still bet it would satisfy most). For me it has more than enough quality sounding bass.I am very happy with how it filled in the lows in both music and home theater use. I adjust the volume +/- 2% depending on whether music/movies. I use with HK receiver and DCM speakers in a 20' x 17' living room (with additional 'airspace' of the additional attached open kitchen and dining room) with hardwood floors and it sounds very very nice. It would have been a waste to spend more on something else. VALUE!
5,I have a twenty year or more old Harman Kardon AVR40 and speakers. Blew out the sub-woofer years ago. Finally decided to break out my vinyl collection and need the extra oomph from a sub-woofer. This one does just what I need to complete the sound. Very happy with it.
5,Love it. Plenty of adjustment on the amp and my receiver so dialing in the perfect sound is easy. Plenty of kick when you want it. Dimensions are 14.5" H x 14" W x 15.5" D (probly 1" less D without screen). Looks great. Sounds great depending on what you're watching/listening to. I have heard that removing the internal baffle will reduce some of the chuff. I only notice chuff on the really low drawn-out descending notes. This may be because it is only 10". I have heard that 12" subs can hit lower notes. Suits my needs perfectly as is. It replaced a passive sub for me. So it is certainly great compared to that. For the money it's hard to beat.
5,It doesn't take a whole lot of volume to add a whole lot of bottom end. I use Mackie BTCR5 monitors with my PC for audio mixing and watching movies. For a hundred dollars (a hundred dollars!!!) this Polk Audio subwoofer is the bomb. Literally the bomb. The Mackies have perfect imaging and clarity of midrange and uppers. This subwoofer makes it like I bought a whole new speaker system. I have all the clarity and now all the bottom end I need. All on my desktop!
5,Perfect companion to my two homepods surround sound setup with my Apple TV and an airport express as an airplay speaker for the subwoofer. Great deep sound that fills the lower end left lacking by the homepods
5,Polk Audio is a solid brand and this subwoofer is no exception to this quality. Don't be fooled by the stats of the sub. the watts may seem a little on the pathetic side but don't worry it will thump HARD. I'm considering buying a second one just because it is such a great product. It has a nice low frequency rating and doesn't fail to hit those low continuos bass lines at increased volume levels. This sub is extremely efficient which basically means that it will produce more noise or bass at lower wattage. You could buy this sub at Best Buy or from Polk Audio themselves for at least double this price there is no reason you shouldn't buy this Sub. It blew my expectations out of the water. one piece of advise before using this sub at high levels to it's full capacity let it break in for about 100 hours of sound or one month's use. this will ensure that your sub will last longer without going to crap and you may notice the sub becoming even more efficient after the 100 hours.
5,Okay it's been awhile since I've been really IMPRESSED with a purchase. This is one of those times!This thing is a beast! It's bigger than I thought it would be. And it puts out some mean bass!! Kinda scary actually. I live in an apartment and I'm really nervous it'll just make the whole place rattle if I turn it up any higher. Right now I keep it at a very modest volume and still get very crisp and full bass! I love it! It makes my music and my TV come to life like I've never heard before!I'm sure with me living in an apartment I'll never really fully realize the full potential of this monster but that's okay. I'm very happy with this sub. And for the price it's a STEAL!
5,I love this subwoofer. Set up was easy. Placed high up in the wall to ceiling media cabinet it produced great bass and a superb addition to surround sound without any tuning of location or levels. Small enough to manipulate and place easily (compared to my previous larger 12 inch sub). Highly recommend.
5,This subwoofer really performs beyond its low price point. As with any subwoofer you'll want your receiver to have a sub out for best performance. I SAY that but currently I am using the speaker input/throughput. Because thats all I have in the bedroom. And it sounds GREAT. So don't shy away if you don't have a SW out jack just get ready for some PITA wiring.
5,Just got this the other day after realizing I needed a sub-woofer out cable I had to wait before actually hearing the way this thing sounded and I have to say totally worth the wait! The little guy rocks. Picks up low end mid and high end bass perfectly. Even though I have this set up in a carpeted room which dramatically reduces it's bass reproductivity the sub still sounds killer! Be sure to note this sub does not have an LFE port which would have been optimal but the left right audio jacks are just fine for my needs. The wood on the outside feels like quality and the finish is beautiful! The front fascia is clean and bolted together with allen bolts which looks cleaner than if it were regular phillips heads. The power cord is decently long as well for optimal placement for the best bass reproduction. All in all great product from a company who knows speakers!
5,I recently was given a pair of POLK shelf speakers and was quite impressed with their performance and overall quality.  So when I saw this subwoofer it seemed the risk would be low in taking a chance on a purchase without hearing it in person.  Well it arrived today and it is amazing!  Well worth the price and very powerful!  Best bass for the buck!  You can not go wrong as this thing is right on!
4,I am the proud owner or two of these babies. I use them in my Library and bedroom systems. Although these sub-woofers are not the latest and greatest of the huge quantity of sub-woofers available to us today they do represent excellent value.They do not go down to 20hz but they do produce tactile bass that is so important in the reproduction of multi-channel movie soundtracks. They crossover between 80hz and 120hz so they will work with a large number of small speakers that lack this bottom end. The placement is flexible as you can adjust the gain the crossover frequency and the phase. They can be attached to a system either through jacks from the sub-woofer jack on a surround sound receiver or with the speaker wires of the front channels passing through the sub-woofer. It's basically a 14" black box and can be places anywhere it will fit in the room. Good dollar to sound value. Almost any system can benefit from the addition of a sub-woofer.
5,bass is top notch no issues with humming overall a quality purchase I needed a 10in bass and this one fits the bill more so considering the price 👌
5,This is my second unit one cherry and one black. This is an outstanding value with full features and connectivity options. They are both in service in two separate home theater setups in my home. One is driven from a new Onkyo subwoofer output and the other driven from a 15 year old old school Onkyo amp by connect the front channel outputs. They are fantastic for medium size room bass for movies and music.  Using various speaker setup methods i am coasting along at less than half amplitude around 75 db on one setup method. Minimal distortion in music and the usual heavy effects in Movies like Oblivion with just the right amount of buzz in the battle scenes. I use the auto power option which only turns the amp on when driven which works well for me. Highly recommended for anywhere near this price point. The second unit replaced a Bose subwoofer that I fooled with for a year to repair at half the repair cost.
5,For under a hundred bucks (used like new) this was a great deal.  The adjustable volume and cross-over frequency allows it to dovetail harmoniously with my other speakers - any of them.  I used it with some very fine cast-metal-housing front speakers that drop out around 80 Hz - and with this set to about 120 Hz the response was even for all the musical spectrum.  With the option of using a speaker-level input OR a line-level input I have a great versatility: by using the speaker level input the volume of the sub is controlled by my setting for my main system speaker volume and I don't need to readjust the sub.  The phase switch is handy though I haven't needed it yet - and the auto-power works perfectly with the speaker-level inputs.  With a 10-inch driver I don't expect to shake the rafters with T-Rex impact tremors - but my thunderstorms are almost as refreshing as the real thing.
5,I actually got this sub for my patio. I didn’t expect it to deliver the bass like it does. I am “blown” away by what it does. We have a 55” tv on the patio with Yamaha speakers in the ceiling. When watching movies it completes the feel and sound of the movies. Truly amazing for the patio. We have an outdoor living room and it’s where I spend the majority of my time when I’m at home. My wife even likes that it completes the experience of watching movies. For music it’s just awesome to have the real sound of music from highs to mids and the bass. Awesome product for the money. You won’t regret purchasing one of these subs.
4,Good entry level subwoofer. I used this with my bookshelf speakers to essentially replace a Sony sound bar and subwoofer I had that died after 16 months and never really integrated with my TV and DVD player like I wanted anyway. This little gem delivers the boom when watching action movies and definitely makes my music sound better. Having had it for over a year now I have noticed I have backed its volume down a bit as it does get a little overbearing when I crank up some old R&B music but once you find the location and the settings that work best you will be happy. If you are an audio snob get real It is a $100 subwoofer if you want pristine clarity at high volumes etc spend more money.
5,I have two of these in my family room and the vibration from the bass makes my alarm chime! Whenever somebody comes over they're always like dam it sounds like movie theater in here. I just ordered a third one for my bedroom.
5,This is a replacement for one that popped some capacitors.  I liked that one so much I bought the same one this one to replace it.  Sounds great with my 7.1 or is it 7.2 surround sound set up.
4,Got this subwoofer to replace a 8 inch Boston Acoustic that came with my receiver and speaker package.  The 8 inch was nice but didn't last but a few months so I was looking until I  found this polk audio 10 inch.  It works great just one problem and that is that it doesn't have a separate LFE input which means you have to buy a splitter to hookup your LFE out from receiver to the red and white inputs on subwoofer.  that is about all that I can see or hear wrong with it.  Should be understood that you will still need to setup the settings on your receiver for the bass and crossover settings which is a no brainer if you follow the manufacturer instructions.
4,The bass is great. The price is pretty damn good. The aesthetic is amazing looks very clean. The only issue depending on the person is the area of bass coverage. The bass is amazing for a single room although if you're looking to use this for a sound system to blare music this won't work. Pretty much cannot hear or feel the bass if not in direct contact. I blasted this in my room and couldn't hear/feel it 15 feet from the door.
5,There is nothing not to love! This sub has been a great addition to my home theater system and packs a TON of punch. I'm glad I didn't get a 12" or 15" sub because this thing already shakes the entire house up through the second floor even at half gain.I'm sure some audiophiles could have some quibbles but I have none. Plus it is gorgeous with the grille cover off! Monstrous bang for the buck and pleasant on the eyes. There is definitely a noticeable quality improvement when watching HD quality videos (streaming or Bluray) over SD or DVDs and I recommend setting it up to one of the Dolby Atmos videos. I just used the Dolby Atmos app on Xbox One - epic!
5,Really love this 10" powered subwoofer. It sounds so much better than the 12" passive subwoofer it replaced. It takes some good program material to reveal the real difference. For example on progressive rock material like Yes or Pink Floyd the bass guitar clearly separates from the kick drum for a very accurate reproduction of the original. This subwoofer pairs well with Polk columns on my system. A new Yamaha receiver drives the system with ease.
5,I am very pleased with this speaker. I have a very critical ear for good sound and it passes my test. I use it with my flat screen tv which has no bass response and I must say it made watching tv and listen to music very pleasing. The base is so smooth and powerful one can feel it and even at low volume settings. It doesn't have a thumping bass sound unless it is in the music. I was playing the tv through a cheap computer speaker system before which left much to be desired and actually irritating to listen to. Unless you have a large area to fill with sound a larger subwoofer is not needed.Update: I am still very happy with this subwoofer. I like the fact that it shuts itself off when there is no sound for a short while so I don't have to physically have to. Just shut the tv off and that is it. I used a sound analyzer and it is playing sounds 60 and below.
5,I live in a small apartment yet love big sound. I needed a subwoofer that fit my limited space 700 sq ft. I live around others so while a 500 watt sub would be great it is too big for my space and much more expensive. This Sub works well for my requirements. Ample bass output for my surround system easy to set up and use. Plus it is very affordable. If you are a fellow apartment dweller check this out.
5,For those that keep saying that this Sub woofer is no good then they have no idea what a sub is supposed to do. I have paired this sub with some Infinity Satellite Speaker Module MS-1 and the combo is perfect. Noticed that I said Satellite speakers not bookshelf or anything like that. A sub is supposed to take over the low frequency of audio. When you pair it with anything larger than sat-speakers then you are defeating the purpose of having a sub as the bass coming out of a larger speakers simply blends with that of the sub and they cancel each other. That is why some of you keep saying that you can not hear the sub. I did have to take some time to calibrate it and ended up setting the sound at no more than half as well as the frequency knob. To me the sub is a steal and it fills my entertaining room of 20' x 20 ' without breaking a sweat...a perfect five stars good listening to you all...........
5,Great performance at a rock bottom price. For those of you not lucky enough like me to pick this up for $69 I will tell you that even at $120 this subwoofer is still very much worth it. My 6 year old Klipsch which recently pooped out was a great speaker but also cost around $400.  I honestly can't tell much of a difference in performance with the Polk sub.  Perhaps not quite the pounding booms during movie action sequences but the overall sound seems warmer and fuller -- not sure how or why but it makes music sound richer than did the Klipsch.  It will take some adjustments both on the sub and on your AV receiver to get the ideal sound for your speaker setup and tastes. I almost wish now that I would have bought a 2nd one for a backup.  For whatever reason my subwoofers never last for more than 5 or 6 years.  I'm hoping this one bucks that trend.
5,Best 130 bucks I ever spent. This bass was a replacement /addition to my pc speakers. I purchased Edifiers for my desk....but the bass was lacking. Added this little gem and man....it brings down the house!! I love this bass!
4,I bought 2 of these subs as 1 wouldn't cut it due to the room size. I can say that the psw10 did its job especially for the price. Unfortunately when I upgraded to the sony str-dn1080 the port noise on the psw10 became common and noticeable (with atmos especially). This sub is great for deep music and moderate bass driven movies. Highly recommended for smaller rooms.
5,Bought this as a second sub to help my main sub and was really surprised at the results. For reference (and suggestion) I have an 8" downfiring  set up 6' high (to avoid bouncing off the furniture)  and 3' away from center of  the main wall. I found this placement well balanced (no dead spots) and with the forward firing Polk set 3' off the floor in the in the corner pointed the center of the room it filled in nicely and can now rattle my bones with no distortion and without pushing either one to hard. I really think this set-up works better than one single more expensive sub. The 8" downfiring is a $100 pioneer hope that helps you decide.
5,Headline describes my feelings im sure theres better but for 100ish bucks you can literally feel the thump. Worth every freaking penny. The neighbors hate me now. The bass is unreal.Update 1/20/2020So I've gotten so hear better subs and I'm still happy with this.. RCA and wire inputs and allows you to synch with another sub. For 100 bucks it still is alot of rumble and still shake a small room with features most subs 200+ won't have. (Mainly both inputs)It's a little punchy but a great deal and a great starter sub!
5,I bought two of these babies three months ago as a part of the T50/T15 surround sound system. My reciever the Sony 590 has 2 sub outs. At first they sounded a bit muddy and distorted at loud volumes. Being a newbie I had to learn the logistics of the bypass filter and the settings within the receiver. After a good amount of burn-in time and learning time on my behalf these subs began to hum and rumble so smoothly I couldn't believe it! I am glad that I chose these at $99 ea rather than going with a much more expensive sub. These meet my needs with no problem.
5,With only 50 watts RMS on tap I had my reservations but the 6.5" sub that came with my Pioneer sound bar left a lot to be desired. The difference was immediately clear. This thing is legit. I don't think It'd cut out for a true home theater in a large room but in a living room application where shaking the windows aren't a priority it's perfect. Relatively compact with solid build quality and a nice clean look - not a cheap look like the theater-in-a-box subs.Sound is much deeper and fuller makes everything sound much more convincing.At the $100 price point I couldn't possibly recommend anything else. The value is unbeatable.
4,This subwoofer is worth the price as well as it's weight. The price was $79.99 pretty cheap for a good quality speaker. As far as it's weight well it's a little on the heavy side  which is a good thing. Chances are it will not be easily knocked over for any reason and also can have certain things rested on top of it should you want it to blend with your home art décor. From the moment it was removed out the box  setup was easy. I didn't have to touch anything to get it to work well with any equipment  just hooked up one cable to the receiver plugged the woofer into the surge protector and that's it . She's up and working and sounds beautiful I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a entry level not over budget subwoofer...
5,This woofer was added to a Yamaha sound bar.  While I was very pleased with the bass on the sound bar this PSW10 made all the difference in the world.  There is plenty of bass to fill a 14'x32' room. In fact I have to turn the volume down or it is too much of a good thing.The sound is very crisp.  It is so much more enjoyable when watching a movie to feel the bass.  The rumble of cars the closing of doors the explosions in the scenes are all felt.  My wife commented "How will we know if it is actual thunder outside or if it is the speaker?"  She has a point.This is a remarkable entry level speaker.  I am pleased that I did the research on it and it proved to be accurate.I would highly recommend this speaker.The order was placed on Sunday night and the speaker arrived at my office on Tuesday at noon.  And that was the free standard shipping.
5,I'm running two of these for my home theater system in a 20x20 room with high cathedral ceilings. (Denon Receiver) This setup is more than enough bass at 1/2 volume and I like a lot of bass. They seem solid and they look really nice. The low pass filter is smooth and responsive. At first I had only purchased one of these thinking that it would be enough but I was wrong. I found that to get it to the volumes I wanted there was some trashy chuffing from the vent port. Some people find this to be a negative but I see it as I was just asking too much of one 50w sub in that size room. With two I can fill my room with clean bass without even getting close to the levels that cause the chuffing noises. They are great subs at their price point and will give you a quality sounding low end. Just be realistic with your expectations if you have a large room.
5,A great sub- use it in my office.  Good controls to set base level output.  Sounds good clear.  Definitely makes a difference in quality of music especially anything with a fair amount of bass e.g. action movie themes.  Reasonably priced well made.
5,I bought this subwoofer to replace my 15 year old unit whose volume control was no longer working.The bass sound quality is great much better than my older speaker which had exactly the same power ratings and speaker size.The bass is clear and crisp and the volume control works well.I use a RCA y-cable at the end of the cable coming off the subwoofer output of my amp and I feed both inputs from the y-cable. This works well with my 5.1 system. I noticed an improvement in the sound quality after adding the y-cable.
5,I wanted a very simple 3.1 system using a single switch to turn on the system. I have two ceiling mid range tweeters and added this Polk Audio woofer facing the wall with the 180° phase switch on.  I have a Fosi 50 watt amp powering the ceiling speakers and I piggybacked left and right channels to the woofer. When I turn on the Fosi amp the signal turns on the Polk Woofer. When I turn the amp off the woofer shuts off after 15 minuets in standby mode. Simple operation! Tested it out playing The Force Awakens. Plenty of power and very clean and no odd vibration. Best bang for under a hundred bucks! You can’t go wrong with the Polk Audio PSW10 10 inch woofer!
4,The product arrived well packaged and undamaged well within the promised time. Out of the box I was impressed with the evident high quality construction for such a reasonable price. It was set it up using speaker in from a basic Sherwood receiver and speaker out to a pair of small Polk speakers mounted about seven feet above the wood floor.  After testing with a variety of classic jazz and  vocal albums I found the best results with the subwoofer crossover set at the highest frequency and the gain at about 30% of full range. Never having had a subwoofer system before I can't offer a comparison but overall I am quite pleased with the PSW10. Eventually I may experiment with a line in connection to see if I can have the crossover frequency set a little higher because I think the PSW10 could handle it and doing so would allow it to rescue the small speakers well before they run out of breath.
3,Sound quality is boomy and not very accurate but at this price it's way better than not having a sub at all.
5,This is a great sub and highly recommend.  Once you fine tune its settings and place it in a good location it produces strong deep clear base.  My setup is (source) Nakamichi AV receiver sub line-out connection sub gain at +3 (subwoofer) line level in sub Low Pass set at 2 o'clock sub volume set at 12 o'clock.  This setup for me produces smooth/mild room filling base at low volume and clean room shaking base at <1/2 volume.  Above 1/2 volume my system is too loud but a 2/3 volume test sub was still clean no distortion. Whether using for music or home theater this sub fills in the low frequencies very nice.  Awesome sub for the price.
5,Just got this recently .box was damaged in shipping but no damage to the subwoofer . highly satisfied by the way this subwoofer  has changed my listening experience. My amplifier does not have a dedicated subwoofer ouput so I used the line in and out connection. This is another plus for this product. I would say for the vast majority of  audio listeners this sub woofer  will exceed their expectation. looks good too.  price and performance is big plus .
5,This does the trick!  I have two Klipsch bookshelf speakers up high where I had an old pair of Bose cubes.  The Klipsch have a better sound but lacked the bass because of where they are.  The Polk subwoofer give just the right amount of bass.  I tinkered with the cross-over and volume with different types of music until it was about in the middle for the various types I listen to. I'm very pleased.
5,Bought this subwoofer for use with my home theater system.  Very happy with the performance clarity and punchiness of the bass.  Replaced an expensive wi-fi subwoofer which never quite worked right with the Polk.  Should have bought the Polk to begin with!
5,I don’t know a whole lot about speakers and audio equipment. But I know how I want it to sound. And this thing sounds pretty damn good for the money. I don’t think I could of found anything better. I use it with a Sony 7.2 receiver that I use to power our whole house surround sound. It’s sounds awesome. I can feel and hear the base threw out the house it’s not quite powerful enough to push the base into our master bath but the whole down stairs now has ample base. It also helped the in wall speaker to sound better since they aren’t trying to push out as much. I used one of those Y connected cables to hook it up. Overall super happy!
5,bought this cause it read number 1 on Amazon but was so concerned about price. def a solid sub with great bass.  you have to buy a cable to connect and I started with the y cable as discussed on the Amazon boards.
5,Bass quality Great just as good as Sony's if not better makes your music stand out love the sound quality. Using it in my bedroom for music but plan on ordering another one for my home theater system.
3,I had the PSW108 for 10 days before receiving this one. Once I plugged this one up I immediately heard the difference. This sub distorts very easily and doesn't play the deeper frequencies as well as the 108. In their defense the do notate the frequency difference in the description. "Breaking the speaker in" really helps. After a week of edm trap and 90s bass music the sub begin to make me feel comfortable about my purchase...that or my expectations finally lowered. The sub did not perform well with movies either. I have a Vizio sound bar and the 6in sub woulds WAY better on Game of Thrones than this 10in sub. End of the day this review is not a ploy for one to go out and spend $300 or better on a sub to get 5 star rating but more so to warn buyers not to expect great performance with loud volumes. This product shines at moderate playing levels. Overall I can see why it's a "best seller" and it's definitely a great option for music but if you want deep rich performance consider another option.
3,Received this subwoofer quickly packaging had no damage.This Polk sub provides additional Bass to my Yamaha YAS 108 soundbar.  The quality of the Bass is less than I hoped for.  It will go loud enough but is not Clean Bass.  I knew when I bought it I was not getting a quality sub.  I just wanted a smaller sized sub for the soundbar in my bedroom.  While I don't watch much TV in there my wife likes to go to sleep listening to thunderstorms via Youtube.  To that end this sub is sufficient and will keep it.A better sub for a home theater set up would be a Bic America f12.  I have one of those and it is a pretty decent sounding sub not great but for around $200.00 it sounds much better than the Polk sub does.I can't really recommend this sub even though I will keep it.  Will probably donate it in a couple of months and get something better.
5,Connected to my new two channel Denon pma 600 for TV & general music listening  good job for size of my space  still playing with settings  but satisfied quality of materials & sound ........personally don't need home theater experience as I only have two ears .................
5,It's not a thing of beauty.  It's basically a black cube -- but then a subwoofer is something you tuck into a corner out of sight and out of mind.  I needed one equipped with speaker level inputs since my stereo receiver has no dedicated subwoofer output.  Setup was a snap.This subwoofer has the full complement of controls:  Line-level and speaker-level inputs adjustable low pass filter so you can blend the subwoofer to pick up the slack at the point your main speakers start to bottom out volume control phase reversal switch (so the subwoofer reinforces rather than cancels the bass coming from your main speakers) and an auto-on switch (automatically powers up the sub when it senses an input signal -- very handy when your sub is located at a distance from your main electronics).Bottom line:  It won't break the bank and the music sounds glorious.  I'd rate it right up there with the 10" Velodyne sub in my home theater system and that one cost five times as much and lacks speaker level inputs.
5,Cost vs quality on this sub is really strong. A very good value in my opinion. The range of bass is very good and plenty for this middle aged guy. Bass will shake your windows with a little Travis Scott but won't blow them out. Overall I am very happy.
5,The PSW10 has been a great addition to my home theater system. I will likely be adding a second to my system in the near future for even more bsss.Great product for the price. It is heavy duty built to last. However it would have been helpful if they would have included a RCA Y adapter since the PSW10 has a dual input.Very happy with this subwoofer and do recommend it.
5,5 out of 5. For everything for the money. Dedicated volume knob Optical and analog in low flutter and low to no port noise. Hook up your own freq. Gen and give it go. Great addition to a "thin" system.
5,My old subwoofers were all 8-10 inches.Some were powered and some were not but none were as HUGE as this one.I just wasn't expecting the sheer size of this thing.However once I heard how it sounded I wasn't about to return it.I honestly can't afford a super high end system. This was a huge increase over my old one.My wife was pretty angry about the size of it though since our house is on the tiny size for rooms.I found an end table at Walmart that was cheap that this fits into very nicely.Crisis averted and my sound has never been better!
4,Nice sub for the money. Great selection for the majority of listeners. If your a serious audiophile you will probably skip right by this sub. I love this for the intended purpose sound system in my work shop.
5,This sub is amazing especially for the price. In a small to medium space it hits hard and I wouldn’t be surprised if it can get the job done in a little bit larger space too. The power cord is also pretty long so finding a nearby outlet shouldn’t be a huge problem
3,First off  this sub is very musical.  I'm replacing an 11-year=old Bose Acoustimass 10 with a mostly Polk setup.  This is going into a small home theater room (but really a bedroom) so it doesn't need to be extremely powerful.  It also sounds good with music; I didn't like the way music sounded on the Bose system.  It was great for movies but I need my music to sound good too.  This sub does the job in that respect.My biggest issue with this sub is the same that a lot of other people have had.  The auto on/off does not work very well.  It's almost a deal breaker.  I'm considering returning it for that very reason.  And it's a shame because this really fit the bill in regards to size being front firing and also being front-ported.  The power isn't anything special but it does the job.  It is only a 50 watt sub after all.  I'm really on the fence about this thing.
5,Perfect added bass for that full stereo sound
5,I've been slowly updating a cheap Sony surround system we bought when we got our TV years ago.  Replacing the old 8" passive sub with the PSW10 was truly dramatic.  The ability to dial in the sub with crossover and volume controls is a nice feature--everyone's situation is different and a "one setting fits all" will not be optimal for most people.  I actually dialed back the power on mine (something I thought I'd never say!)  Materials seem of high quality the packaging was excellent.  And really for $99???  An amazing value.  (I also bought Polk's CS10 center speaker and am very impressed with it as well.)  If it holds up well this subwoofer has to be the best value out there.  Highly recommended!
5,When adjusted properly this subwoofer produces strong low bass without boxiness or boom. It has excellent transient response. Perhaps the 10" woofer is an optimum size - big enough to produce powerful bass yet small enough to handle transients well. The built in amplifier has plenty of power. Used in a fairly large room (apx 20' x 20') with a vaulted ceiling this subwoofer produces plenty of bass for realistic reproduction of pipe organ orchestra chorus and popular music that is not ear piercing. I don't know how it performs with 130 db rock because I don't listen to that kind of music. This subwoofer is an extremely good value! I use it with an Onkyo compact stereo system and they seem to complement each other perfectly. I have also used it with an inexpensive Sherwood receiver and a pair of old compact Realistic speakers and the sound was very pleasing.Regarding movies the subwoofer performed powerfully with "Enemy at the Gate" about the battle of Stalingrad. This movie had much low bass (exploding bombs and artillery shells). Some other movies had rather weak bass. This is a movie problem; not a subwoofer problem.
4,This sub has a good set of controls on the back for adjustments and has a very good frequency response for music (under 40Hz).  If you want to use this for a home theater(or want bone rattling thumping from certain kinds of music) though forget it.  You really need to spend more money on a sub that will accurately play down to 25Hz if you have a medium sized room or larger and this won't do it.  Also this sub doesn't have rubber feet so expect to get a decent pad or something else under it if you don't want to hear it vibrate when it's even a little loud.I will use this in my garage or office with a pair of Boston Acoustic cubes for light listening of MP3's sometimes very loudly and for the $80 I paid for this it's excellent.
4,Great product for the money. Nice tight bass!
5,I just love the bass it puts out and looks great with the Polk S20s S10s and S35 center speaker. The PSW10 was the final piece in my speaker upgrade. 👍🏽
3,I write this with mixed feelings.  It sounded really good but I cranked it all the way up and I just couldn't feel it.  I wanted to love it (it replaced a fantastic older Polk down firing that I'd had for 19 years) but I didn't.  It didn't hit as hard as I wanted it to.  50W just isn't enough and my room is on the smaller side.  I guess if you don't need your couch to shake during a movie then this is fine but if you are looking for some umph then you'll want to pass.  I sent this back and got a different highly rated 300W subwoofer and it kicks.
1,First of all this thing is much bigger than I expected.  I should’ve constructed a cardboard replica from the stated dimensions so I could appreciate how much living room space it was going to gobble up.  Now for the durability:First one worked great for 3 days then AUTO stopped working.  It wouldn’t turn on when a sound signal was sent to it.  Only way to get it to turn on was to leave power switch in ON position 24/7 which may shorten amplifier life uses power needlessly and could be a fire hazard while I’m not home.  I returned it and Amazon sent the replacement by US Mail and the Postal service lost it.  Why not UPS like the original shipment Amazon??The third one arrived via US Mail and was immediately defective.  Only way to get it to turn on in AUTO mode was to turn input volume up to deafening levels.  Once it activated (green light and good bass) I turned volume back to normal listening levels and in a while the sub turned itself back off (red light and no sound).I returned the second unit and asked for a refund.  I couldn’t actually get a refund through the web page’s normal refund button because the replacement which I was returning was listed by Amazon as a $0 cost to me (since it was a replacement) so my refund would have been $0 and my original purchase price would’ve been kept by Amazon.  I had to talk to an Amazon rep and she assured me she would refund my original purchase price when the second return made it back to them.  I hope so.  Darn shame Polk’s electronics are so flaky because the sound was fantastic.  I loved the way it sounded but I’m now forced into buying one for many times the price from SVS to get something that will hold up.  QC Polk!
5,I'm not an audiophile but this sub sounds just as good as the Martin Logan MLT-2 it's replacing. There's so much bass it took me awhile to tone it down to where I like it. It is in my 330 sq ft family room that's open to the 300 sq ft kitchen; sounds great no matter where I am. Fit nicely in the available shelf space. I only wish it didn't have the silver trim around the outside edges.
4,Paired it with a set of Edifier bookshelf speakers. I only have it at about 10% volume and it’s quite loud... Really fills out the low end well. It’s nice to have an adjustable internal crossover although it isn’t very sharp. Even with the crossover all the way down there’s still a decent amount of low-mid coming through.The biggest problem is the hum from the internal power supply transformer. It’s quite noticeable in an otherwise silent room. The unit has a “soft” power switch so turning it off doesn’t make the hum go away - you have to unplug it. When not playing music it’s annoying.
5,I used to have a cheap Mivoc SW1500 with a gigantic 15inch woofer in it but it died on me. So I figured I get something that doesnt take up the entire room and is affordable. This thing is a lot of bang for buck. Great for movies and even for music it's quite nice. The crossover is a bit iffy when it comes to switching between movies and music but overall it works great!
5,I am new to sub-woofers so take this into considerations.  I added this to a Yamaha CA 610 II amplifier the powered active subwoofer worked well because the amplifier already powering one set of speakers (pioneer CS-99) and amplifier is not that big.  Great performance out of the unit but I didn't like it in mono so I added a 8" active yamaha subwoofer and run them left/right channel so in stereo much better for listening to music.  My listening space is about 15x15 this set up works fine.  Because it is run through my B speakers (A+B) I can shut them off and still run my main speakers (A only)  i like that the subwoofer comes with different options for inputing the signal.
4,I strongly disagree with reviewers who claim that this sub is disappointing when used for movie watching in a home theater setup. This sub fills my 240-sq.ft. basement with plenty of clean (not muddied) bass whether I use it for movies or music and I only need to keep the gain dial on the back between 30%-40%. Anything more and the bass can be felt up on the third story of my townhome. It certainly met my needs and in order to obtain any noticeable difference in performance you'd have to spend at least 3 times as much. I am taking a star off for its "limitations" (extent of low frequency range and ability to fill larger rooms) which should be expected at this price range. In my opinion best entry level sub at that price range and size. Place it properly (I placed mine next to one of the front level speakers with its back against the wall) and you won't be disappointed.
4,Read all of the reviews so I was not sure about ordering it.  I have never had a sub on my system and finally got around to ordering one.  It adds plenty of rumble in my 13'x26' living room (hardwood floors) and my Onkyo HT-460.  I have not turned the volume on the sub past 50%.  It seems to fill out the lower end of normal sounds o.k. and does a better job at the rumble and punch for movie sound effects.  It is OK for music with heavy bass but not perfect.  I have room for another sub and will probably upgrade for the next one.  If I buy two new ones I will move this to my old surround system.  Overall well worth the cost.  If this is your first and you are on a budget get this one.
5,I have a Bose system for my entertainment center  Nice surrounnd sound but the included subwoofer if off in a corner.  After furniture rearrangement I found that I was diagonally across the room from the base.  By adding the Polk unit the base is no longer directional. Perfecto.  The Polk unit was simple to install and set up and it does exactly what I wanted it to do.
5,Great sound easy to use. Wish there was remote for the bass specifically but we found the sweet zone and it works fantastic.
5,I bought this sub to add to a living room surround setup to be used with 90% movies and games and 10% music.  It's exceeding my expectations so far.  I've had it about 3 months and I'm really happy with it.  It adds the exact bottom end I was looking for. Explosions sound great games sound great and the missing atmospherics in soundtracks are there now.  It also brings a nice punch to kick drums and bass synth sounds.  I don't know if it could satisfy someone who really wants to do drop bass hitting really hard.  I don't think it was designed for that.  As long as it stands the test of time though I'd say it would satisfy most folks' needs pretty well.  For the money I think it's awesome!
5,Definitely adds bass to my set up great for a small room and also a medium sized living room. If you live in an apartment you may get noise complaints.I paired it with edifier 1280 Dbs speakers and it sounds great.
5,My Polk Audio PSW10 arrived on the short side of when Amazon said I would get it was weighting for it hooked it up to my Pioneer SX980 stereo receiver which was hooked to the Polk M30-2 Monitors which I like very much by themselves hooked to my vintage Pioneer SX980 receiver got out my old Stereophile Test CD and ran a test with out using the PSW10 inline found where the M30s started to drop off in output in my system then ran another test with the PSW 10 in line  matched the two together had to drop the Power output of the PSW10 down a tad. the system sounds excellent with low down to 34Hz that you can feel even at low listening levels with my points the PSW10 was around $75. to my door  Polk makes some very fine speakers for a very reasonable price and buying them through Amazon made the deal even better.  Thank You Amazon and Polk Audio am very very happy!...............walter
5,Passive mode allows you to add a amplifier or another receiver to power the subwoofer. Can shake a 24 x 40 wooden room.
5,I bought this after reading so many 5 star reviews and for the price of $99 everyone said it was a steal.  I got very lucky and got it for only $70 including shipping/tax.  And after hooking it up I am completely blown away at how well this sub performs.  It's awesome for both music as well as for movies.  And I have a huge family room (about 18 feet by 20 feet with 12 foot ceilings as well) and I put this inside the lower cabinet of my built-in entertainment center (with a screen on the door front).  There's no rattling and the bass is very smooth and it's set right in the middle using the adjustment knob.  So it has plenty more power to turn it up even more if one wanted to.  I don't normally write reviews but I am so impressed with this that I had to.  You won't be disappointed.
5,A terrific value for the money.The old audiophile in me had to play with its settings ... and what worked best (in my 15' x 9" study) were:* volume at only 9 o'clock* cross-over at maximum (160 Hz)* set the receiver cross-over to 150 Hz - to matchIn other words I let this sub-woofer do the work below 160 Hz  rather than the bookshelf speakers (Panasonic A. Jones SP-BS22-LR ... which have the ubiquitous 4" polyurethane midrange speaker).The above settings resulted in nice tight non-boomy bass that blends flatly with the midrange.Those bookshelf speakers test pretty flat down to 80 Hz which is where I first tried the cross-over settings.  This resulted in a more boomy muddy bass to my ear.  The above settings result in a much more pleasant tight bass ... especially for LONG-term listening.
5,I bought this to replace an existing sub that had stopped working.  I already have the larger sub from Polk.  I bought this one because of the price and the "expected" quality.  I have not been disappointed.  When the time comes I would buy Polk again.
4,I would give this 5 full stars except for one item with some reverb when it is powered on.  This is resolved when actively being used and the auto on/off resolves this most of the time except for when I first turn it on.The mulitple hook up options are very versitle and will connect to just about any stereo given the options. The manual volume make it function good to your taste.  My largest issue is how the hooks ups are on the back and the speaker/port on the front.  It makes it difficult to face the sub into the corner for better base and hide your wiring.  I end up having to either face it the wrong way or look at the wires. Just being able to move the grill cloth on the back would solve this problem.
4,I purchased a small Polk set of speakers and this Subwoofer for my parents. I needed this Subwoofer for the speaker wire connections as my parents old A/V receiver does not have a dedicated Subwoofer output. I hooked everything up according to directions put in The Phantom of the Opera Blu Ray for my parents and I have to say I was quite impressed with this little $99 Subwoofer. It perfectly suits the needs of the system I put together for them. Will it blow you away with room filling Bass...NoIt will dramatically enhance the sound of a small Home Theater system at an incredible price!
5,So happy I upgraded to the Polk Audio PSW10 10". I literally plugged it to the headphone jack (which is also a sub out) of my Sony 4K TV with a RCA splitter and it works like a boss (No need for receiver) paired it with a bluetooth speaker so i can have it close to my ears It complimented each other so well...watched a terrible movie with awesome visual and sound track and it just out performs the cost of this sub...I would pay 150 and still be very happy and impressed with it. For $90 it will make you smilehttps://www.amazon.com/Sony-XBR65X900F-65-Inch-Ultra-Smart/dp/B078GZYDFK/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1_sspa?keywords=sony+x800f+4k+tv&qid=1551974296&s=electronics&sr=1-1-fkmrnull-spons&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/s?k=jsaux+rca+cable&i=electronics&crid=3MCHJ8TOMWCW5&sprefix=jsaux+rca%2Celectronics%2C161&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_9
5,For a product on the low end of Polk's cost structure this unit performs amazingly well.  Actually it sounds like it cost much more.  Instructions on the controls are clear easy to follow and effective...something you cannot say about many electronic products.
4,Wanted the 12 inch but had to settle for 10 due to shipping. Sounds OK in a room with in-wall speakers echos and other bad acoustics for 75 inch TV. Fills in bass fine. Very good value though. Only complaint is the grill does not seal the speaker from geckos. Too open at the edges! Onkyo receiver was able to complete room adjustments OK. Overall much better than the tiny TV speakers.
5,We had to replace our sub woofer because it was busted .  This one had an amazing sound and all the hook ups were exactly the same as the old one. We are hearing sounds we haven’t heard in years
4,I find the resolution/response/acuity of this subwoofer to be not as accurate as my Pioneer SW8MK2 but I really like that this subwoofer has higher power handling/output.  As a worldwide audio professional who spends his time in A-List studios I give this subwoofer a high recommendation especially for the price and level of quality.  (BTW I am using it with a pair of Dynaudio M1 monitors all driven by a little Dayton Audio DTA-2.1BT2 amplifier which is a diamond in the rough and which I urge you to check out.)
5,I love the bass quality!  I have it in a 2.1 setup right now and love it. The volume control works great and the sound quality is great.  I would buy again if I ever upgrade to a bigger setup.
2,I wanted to keep it because of $. I had got two. It just has too much distortion. I once it got a refurbished Bose Cinemate 15 for I believe $250 during a sale. If you are used to clean not boomy not distorted bass - you are not going to like this speaker. I tried really hard to keep it but it was so distorted that even after keeeping it for a week still did not think it is worth it.Maybe it works for home theater and movies but it distorts terribly for music. And this is at 5-10% of volume.So I spent a lot of time too much time in fact trying to find a good alternative which is not too large - 12 inches is too large for me. This is what I ended up finding which seem to be good as well as reliable and not too large.Polk Audio 10 Inches 200 Watts Home Theater Subwoofer Black Walnut (HTS SUB 10 BLK WAL)Also the second speaker needed to be better than the above one because it is for a much larger room. And this is what I found which suited me:Klipsch R-100SW 10" SubwooferThese are the cheapest smallest low tier and slightly better speaker you can find on amazon or elsewhere (spent a lot of time on research). Hope this helps someone.If these two work out or not will add review for that under that item.
5,This is a great subwoofer but your gonna need two of them if your a real g. Very much worth the price. would recommend
5,This speaker has the sound quality of more expensive speakers.  I have the volume at a low setting and I still get chest pounding bass from the action scenes in movies.  It is easy to wire directly from a digital optical outlet on most TV's using a converter from toslink to RCA connections.  Amazon also offers these converters as well as other sites.  It is a little bigger than some other 10 inch speakers but still fits in spaces to not be obstructive.  If you are looking for an entry level subwoofer with good sound and on a budget the Polk PSW10 is an excellent choice
4,This is the second PSW10 10" Powered Subwoofer i have purchased and I find them good value for the money.
5,This thing hits pretty hard and sounds great. I have it in my garage and added the nice kick I needed.
4,This is a standard issue subwoofer that does the job of boosting the low end for a small home theater system. The footprint is larger than it needs to be for the performance. It might be because its amplifier has only a 50W RMS output (peak output 100W). Overall a reasonable product. At this price point subs are almost generic without much difference between the various products available.
5,I liked the bass sound.
5,Hook up was a cinch and the sound quality is superb. I was able to adjust the levels to get the bass I wanted with a few tweaks of the knobs. I don't know how I lived without it for so long.
5,I have been in HI-Fidelty stereo since it's inception and am a retired Physicist. There is a relationship ( with many variables ) in reviewing a subwoofer. Room size/volumelistening distance wave theory and those  host of "placement" issues. I have found this subwoofer to be XLNT in a  small to medium sized room for acoustical music. It has  niether the cone size or power to produce an F-16 flyby in a large room; nor should anyone "in the know" expect it to. But in an assisted living apt.(me) it picks up the "wood" in the musical arrangements of Jazz and Classical. Setting in close helps all bass subwoofers as reflected sound in  larger rooms is an acoustical nightmare.It takes 10 times the power to produce a doubling in sound pressure(db). So if you have a large room look for large RMS power ratings and especially large cone sizes. Manufacturers are always implying their 8" is as good as a 12" . But the db ratings and laws of physics do not support this in any way. This PSW 10 is a great bargain but not a "bass monster." Enjoy !
4,Great home subwoofer for the price for anyone who is not a hardcore audiophile. Being an audiophile myself I was actually pretty impressed the output and sound of this sub. I've owned Polk car stereo components in the past and believe that Polk really does make quality stuff.Of course it won't sound like $800 home theater sub but that is to be expected. The type of room it is in will GREATLY effect the sound of any sub (carpeted floors curtains symmetrical room will make it sound much better) but it does sound a little "boomy" at some frequencies and kind of lacking in others.Overall if you are looking for a good sub at a great price that will improve your home theater/living room experience get this sub!
5,these seem have a quick break-in period. the first day I was listening to this sub I didn't think much of them and thought about returning them. as I played more and more songs in to the next morning after I woke up this sub really started to come alive. I am using this sub as part of my 3 way setup. I have two bookshelf powered speakers by creative reference and am using a y cable and adapter. the sub adds so much added depth and really makes the music come alive. I have a ton of headroom to upgrade my bookshelf speakers. the gains on this sub are only up about a quarter of the way up and it really pounds on heavy bass songs and hits with a snap on songs with a lot of midbass.
5,For the price this is great. Can fill a medium sized room. Definitely doesn't go down to 20hz maybe 50hz max. There is noticeable port noise when you turn it above half volume. LPF and auto on features are great. I am very satisfied for the price.Perfect for adding bass to your living room. I use it for small 3" monitors for my desk. I normally listen to it at a non ear bleeding volume and the fill the subwoofer provides is very noticeable and enjoyable. Turned up high the subwoofer likes to make the drop down ceiling rattle. This is not a subwoofer to make your house shake or to make your ears bleed from the club banger songs you love. My purpose was for the sub to fill in the missing low end of my speakers. If this sub cost more there would be much to be desired.
2,One would assume that when buying a subwoofer that al necessary hardware is in it.  NO WIRE!!  Make sure to purchase wire and plug.
5,I'm by no means a audiophile. But I do know what a amazing sub sounds like. Read the reviews for a more technical description. All I can say is that you'll be hard pressed to find another sub woofer this versatile and powerful for this price! I was skeptical at first but after reading so many 4 and 5 star reviews I pulled the trigger. Night and day difference over my old RCA. Almost twice as big too but the size isn't a issue for me. Especially with it producing the bass this thing is putting out. And don't let the wattage for you. It's more than powerful enough to get the job done.
5,These are amazing (regardless of the low price.) They look good and have more than enough power for my small home theater (I bought two to spread the bass out.) As others have said ease into them and give them a couple of weeks to break in.
5,Great subwoofer. Purchased to use with transparent zeros amd it worked very well. Now using it with a zvox 203 and it again is blending in well. Perfect for music and or movies. Great sub and better than many costing much more.
5,This subwoofer sounds better than expected. It has a 100 watts but sounds very powerful. I wouldn't believe it was only 100 watts if not stated by Polk. I have the volume (gain) at half and also have my receiver set at -8 for subwoofer and it gives me the bass that I need without smoothering my other speakers.The only concern is that the legs of the box have broken. They are plastic and screwed on. I believed they we're screwed too tight to the point that it cracked them. Good thing is that it is easy and cheap to replace with rubber legs which I did.
5,Bass sounds great and with the help of an SMSL USB DAC/AMP my Polk TSi100s are filtered through this sub for a great and powerful overall sound. Couldn't be more satisfied.
5,This sub-woofer is an awesome piece of music engineering! I added it to my music studio setup. It is easy to balance and provides super clear bass response. It was on sale for $99 best bucks I ever spent on a speaker!  This speaker will vibrate my whole house if I turn it up.  I tried it in my 25' x 25' great room with my home entertainment system. It fills the room and that's at 50%.
5,Amazing Sub! Clean clear bass. Great power too!  The auto input signal on off is a great feature. This makes my outdoor patio speakers sound so much more amazing.
5,With the advent of subsonic sounds in movies a sub is a must. All the rap they inject into movies and the subsonic noise in action movies just can't be maintained by bookshelf speakers anymore. You need to cut those low frequencies from the smaller speakers.
5,I won't delve into technical analysis as others more competent than I have already done so.I can tell you this is an excellent entry-level subwoofer that will pair very nicely with entry level bookshelves like the   Micca MB42x's] or [[ASIN:B00N8265I8 Micca Covo         speakers.  Crossover controls work well and it hits fairly hard.  This would even work well in a small home theater room.  If you're looking for computer speakers this would work well paired with a set of small bookshelves and an entry-level amp like the   Nobsound        .While it won't be winning any awards for sound quality it is a very strong deal at its price point.  I got mine from Amazon open box and for what I paid it really is unbeatable in my opinion.
4,Loving the sub-woofer it does add so much more feel to movies music or anything else you are listening to. And does not make everything sound like in a teenagers car packed full of subs. Only thing I do not like is that this one does not have LFE like every other subwoofer I have seen. I did not realize this when buying the sub so I did not order the Y-Split needed. It does work nice indeed with out the Y-Split by setting the crossover to the max but I do wish the sub did come with a Y-split adapter since it is needed/recommended and its not the most common (So far I have not been able to find a single one in my area)
5,Absolutely amazing. Don’t waste any more time. Buy this ASAP. I can finally hear all the bass I have been missing. Seriously I got it in 1 1/2 days with prime. Very easy setup. Really unbelievable BASS. You will not regret it. The true way music can be appreciated.
5,It's not a 5 star item for the $500 range but for less than $100 this is a might impressive sub. I have this setup as my current PC sub woofer and paired with 2 Klipsch bookshelf speakers makes a great movie watching setup. I felt like it represented the bass in the movies I watched very accurately and only a little rumble around what I suspect is 45hz or lower.Listening to music it was right on the money.I have the crossover set on my receiver @ 120hz and the one on the sub all the way up so it's filtered by the amp instead. Volume at 50% and it's plenty of ambiance. It's nice that it has a 180 degree phase so I can hook up with my other sub later when I want to play around but using this as the living room sub.
4,I am very pleased with how well this mated with a pair of NHT SuperZero speakers.  Setting the crossover at 100Hz the sound was much fuller.  Bass seemed to come from the NHT's rather than the subwoofer - as it should.  The NYT Wirecutter recommended the similar priced Monoprice subwoofer (which is out of stock at the manufacturer) and the cheap BIC - but I've also owned the BIC in the past and it really sounded terrible.  Your mileage may vary but I'm a happy camper.
5,This is the 2nd subwoofer I have purchased.  I had this one saved but the price jumped from $99 to $120 - I made a poor decision and bought a $99 Audio Acoustic Subwoofer.  Mistake!  I saw the price drop on this one and bought it.  I already have Polk Audio bookshelf speaker that I have been incredibly impressed with.  This subwoofer shares the same quality!
5,This subwoofer more than met my expectations. I had read a lot of the reviews about this speaker before making the purchase. I wanted to be sure I was making the right purchase and that it would fulfill my bass needs with my Home Stereo System. Wow does this thing hit hard! It has a built in powered amplifier with plenty of extra features along with it. I love the crossover control and volume control built in to the sub. Makes tuning this thing for the right sound super easy. I know Polk makes quality car audio speakers and now I know their home audio speakers are just as well made. If you have a home theater system or are looking to build one and need a subwoofer you can't go wrong with this one. Sounds great when listening to music too!.
5,This is my second PSW10 subwoofer which means I now have TWO (one on each side). This is used in a 5.2 setup which is all I really need. Two of these subwoofers produce some awesome bass with ZERO distortion. I'm assuming that has to do with the fact that you don't have to crank up the gain as much to get twice as much sound. Whatever the reason TWO subwoofers is the only way to fly. I had read that in several reviews and articles on subwoofers in general and they all said the same thing; two subs sound better than one. They're right.This was an outstanding purchase and the service was excellent the shipping was FAST and I couldn't be more pleased with the result. I also have Polk mains center channel and rear speakers (collect the whole set!). Great speakers!
4,My old set up was an Onkyo budget 5.1 surround system with a passive subwoofer. When I upgraded to a better (albeit still budget) system with aYamaha RX-V375 5.1 Channel 3D A/V Home Theater receiver I kept the old Onkyo speakers and added the PSW10 powered subwoofer.My living room is 15 feet deep and 10 feet wide with a cathedral ceiling. The accoustics aren't great and I have enough furniture and window coverings to keep it from becoming an echo chamber. The PSW10 is fine for what I use it for mostly watching Blurays and DVDs while occasionally listening to CDs at moderate levels (mostly classical classic rock and world music). I couldn't expect more for the price. Installation was simple also.
5,Added these to my Sony receiver Technics turntable Bic Venturi Bookshelf speakers.  Takes a little work to fine tune everything but what a difference.  I don't have a subwoofer output just A/B speaker outputs.  Works fine.  Just plugged a wire into L or R speaker output plugged into Subwoofer speaker input.  Plugged in electricity turned on and then it's just adjusting volume and crossover Hz to sound.  After a while  you begin to hear sounds on records you'd missed before.  I already had 6 in woofers on my speakers but now this will handle the lows and speakers the midrange and tweeter work.  Seems build solid and so many positive reviews here.  Great price as well.
3,The speaker sounds good but in my experience setting the power switch to "auto" does not work all the time. Often times the subwoofer will not turn on automatically but if I flip the switch to "on" and then back to "auto" it will stay powered up for the duration of whatever I'm watching or listening to. After messing with it for hours and only getting unhelpful canned responses from Polk Support I ended up just leaving the switch in the "on" position and turning the subwoofer on and off at the power outlet. Kind of disappointing.
5,I bought this sub to see how it will sound in my living room.  This combined with a cheap soundbar will enhance your movie experience to another level.  I actually feel like I'm in a movie theatre.  If bass is what you want at an affordable price this is a good buy.  I returned my Klipsch 12 because I couldn't justify paying 300 for some bass.  This sub does just fine.
5,Before i bought this i thought there is no way it can beat my sony set up.I was wrong. this thing hits HARD. and sounds good when doing it.  i really love this bass.
4,Yes you get what you pay for but sometimes you get a little bit more. Such is the case with this Polk subwoofer. It is a good match for the new TSx speakers I bought for both music and home theater surround sound. Everything is driven by a Yamaha RXV475 and for the most part the PSW10 provides the bass. There are several methods of hooking this up and it can be fine-tuned to a degree through the amplifier's menu and the sub's own switchery. No regrets. It may still be "breaking in" as it sounds better all the time. I do have one problem...it doesn't always automatically shut-off and turn-on when it is supposed to. Email to Polk's customer service was fruitless...no answer. I hope I never need warranty work.
5,I've been using the same pair of Sonic 3-way stereo speakers for over 40 years. Obviously audio technology has come a long way in that time. Endeavoring to be on the cutting edge of audio tech I decided to pair this Polk Audio subwoofer with my old speakers. OMG! What a nice sound! I used a 6-foot FosPower RCA Y-Adapter to hook up the PSW10 with the right and left RCA connections. Very impressive! I have the volume knob on the PSW10 turned up only to the halfway position and I'm getting plenty of bass for my taste. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
5,I did a lot of research on this. I love music but I also needed a subwoofer to compliment my Bose speaker (5) system. Our tv room is 30 X 40. This subwoofer is great! I had a professional tech guy come to the house and calibrate my tv and stereo system and all I needed was a subwoofer. At first I couldn't get it to work and thought I had a bad one but after reading my receiver manual and figuring out that the "subwoofer" was OFF I turned that ON and bingo sound was fabulous! I read the other reviews and some of those reviewers are a whole lot more technically informed than me but I will tell you that you will not be disappointed with this subwoofer unless you are looking for a specific sound. If you want something to rumble the room during a movie or thump you when you listen to music in a big or small room get this speaker set the volume to your liking and enjoy.Can't beat the value for the money. Nuff said!!
4,The only reason I’m not giving this this unit 5 stars is that I haven’t had it long. Performance is unbelievable. It’ll shake the windows if you set it high enough. At normal levels it fulfills the remainder of the sound I’ve been looking for. It’s paired to a Denon 4311 with Dolby and the sound is awesome. I would highly recommend this unit.
4,Ok yes it's a little bit muddy and sure there's a bit of port noise but it's $100! You should be spending more than that on just the box if you want something perfectly clean. Does this thing have short comings? Yes but it's one hell of a sub for $100 and I would challenge anyone to find something better for the money. It reaches lower than a 10" should be able to and you definitely know it's there.Keep in mind when reading reviews that you need to feed this sub signals for it to perform. Where those signals come from and how they're delivered has a lot to do with the end result. I can make this sound like crap too if I want to.
5,The base is good and loud but can be tighter.  Its a good complement to my r1700bt which I use in my home office and the sounds fill the room while not being too loud.  Nice options for connectivity and control.At standby (no sound input) the power usage is 7 watts according to my watt-o-meter.  So this sucker drains power when not used but plugged in. You may want to consider using a smart plug to remotely turn it on or off only when you want that extra base to kick in.
5,I'm not a rookie nor and I an audiophile with a 50k set up.  This sub is ideal.  I have a very large room with my system.  The 10'' fills it up with more than enough bass and moderate volume.  When I listened to "live" music and cranked it the bass was tight and even.  Volume control is a must because too much bass watching regular tv is to just much.  It can be easily tuned to just fill the room like a sub should.
3,Bought this as a gift for a family member … hooked it up and found that the sub rattles as if there’s rocks inside of it instead of that nice rumble that a sub would normally give you .
5,Due to the amazon reviews i purchases this for my surround system it works awesome but be sure to set it up correctly on your receiver. A great 10” inexpensive subwoofer
5,It has gone up drastically in price this year but still a great subwoofer.  Rich sound in a compact package.
5,Reading numerous reviews on several different subs proved to be quite enlightening - a big thank you to Amazon's "techie" customers for your awesome reviews! I always knew gas engines had to be "broken in" but never realized speakers benefited from it too!Due to the small size of my front speakers I needed a sub that crossed over a little higher than the "ultimate" subs do. This Polk Audio PSW10 fits the bill quite nicely. The bass response is significantly better than I got from the stock sub that came with my Klipsch 5.1 speaker set.Whether listening to tunes or the latest action flick my system now sounds a heck of a lot better. It's particularly noticeable with newer music which seems to have a wider dynamic range (and much  lower lows) than the old "classics".Buying this sub was a lot cheaper than buying a whole new speaker set and proved to be an excellent upgrade - I'm very happy with this purchase.
5,Nothing to dislike I’m not a picky person but my clean music is very important! This Polk is connected to my Harmon- Kardon 3770 2.1 receiver! Adds a whole new dimension to Bass! I have never read a bad review on this and I know why! It’s excelled for the money!!!! Can’t go wrong!
4,I wish I could give this sub a full 5 stars but I can't. Don't get me wrong it's a damn good sub. But at low frequencies it produced a lot of port noise which if you don't know what that sounds like it sounds like a fart haha. It gets muddy at low frequencies which but I guess you should expect that out of a sub that's $90. If you're into rap or dubstep songs with a lot of bass this sub may not be right for you. It brings my movies to life which I like but it sort of sounds muddy with the rap music I listen to. If you're on a budget this is the best budget sub you can get.
5,I've had this sub for 7 months and had it on max volume for all 7 months. It's part of my home theater system and boy do this s*** put tones of base out. It honestly should cost more. I live in a brownstone in newyork and when I play a song or a movie you can hear ans feel the base outside of the house on the street. That's through 2 feet of brick and cement. It fills my entire house with good high quality base. I've had the pb13 ultra by svs and I returned it after getting this sucker.  If you wanna break your windows then get any of the svs pb line subs but if you just want high quality bass that you can feel in your chest than this is your sub.
4,I'm kinda torn here. The sub was making a weird farting sound out of the port. After some research I was able to eliminate the sound by stuffing a rolled towel in the port. Now the sound is tight. It lost a lot of volume by sealing the port but the sub was super loud anyway. I just turned up the volume/gain knob on the back to reclaim the volume. I don't know why people are saying the sub isn't that loud. It shakes the walls and you can really feel the movie. Great for the price range. Just a little disappointed I had the block the port to stop that annoying noise. I had higher expectations from Polk.
5,Bought sub-woofer for $100. I did not expect much from a 10" sub-woofer. I bought it to add on to a mediocre stereo. The sub-woofer has great bass level and low frequency response. It fills my garage with awesome bass. Controls in the back are excellent. Adjust volume to mix/balance with shelf stereo without overpowering with bass.
5,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality this bass has.  I know Polk is a leading manufacturer of subs but even this inexpensive model sounds great!
4,For $99 can't go wrong to add low end to home theater. Keeping it set  at about 40% power for plenty of punch @50% that low end rumble on action movies can be felt! NFL games really come alive hearing their hits ...Hit you!  If you really intended to make the walls shake the Polk PSW10 can do that but you'd probably want to spend more if you need the sub to part your hair all through a show. Not my taste to shake my dentures! This unit fills my 25x40 living room with 10' ceilings. Great bang for the buck!
4,This is a great subwoofer for the money 5 stars would have been if it was just a hair more efficient in some areas but I’m thinking of buying a second one great product shakes my house pretty good movies are crazy
4,It was working for 2 yes fine. But then the heart beat sound started and it’s gone. Seems it’s common for this sub. Polk can you help?
5,I use it in my bedroom and have inexpensive but high quality sounding speakers (probably because I don't blast them with full wattage). But added high-end tweeters and needed a decent inexpensive subwoofer. THIS PUPPY ROCKS !!! It upgrades my sound system several notches. Again I don't put it on full wattage BECAUSE IT WILL BLOW SOMETHING APART !!! Fully enjoying it and fully unexpected.
5,Bought this for my home theater room.Added great bass and really completed the overall sound quality.
5,Never had this type of speaker and now realize how much I had been missing.  Certainly exceeded my expectations.
5,This subwoofer met all my expectations. Easy set up and easy controls. Good value.
4,I am overall very satisfied with this subwoofer. For 100$ you really can't find anything comparable without looking for used gear. I did have an issue with the subwoofer rattling. If you own this sub and are experiencing the same thing I realized it wasn't rattling when I picked it up leading me to believe the pegs attached to the bottom were the problem. I have since created a cushion between the sub and the floor and the problem went away. Also try changing the location of the sub in the room.  Overall great purchase.
5,OK its not a CVA-121 21" Active Subwoofer used for live concert performances in 20000 seat auditoriums.  It is a fantastic sub for your home and if you have a large room buy 2 -they're dirt cheap.  I have a 14X20 Home theater room.  My Home theater seats are 2/3's of the room away from a 100" projector screen.  I put one of these little gems on the front wall below the screen facing the seats and another one behind the seats facing sideways.Wow!!!! Everyone has been impressed by these subs and when I tell them how much they were people are stunned.I'm a musician (Drums Bass Guitar and Lead/Rythm Guitar) with 2 tube half stacks an 8-10" bass cabinet and a 10 pc drum set.  I'm very demanding when it comes to sound.  Being honest I bought these because they were cheap expecting to replace them within the first year and have been very impressed.Are there other subs that are better yes but not at this price point.Enjoy.
5,This guy does the job and does it well. The bass is solid and you really only need something not some huge massive 12". That being said i use this on a pinball machine (Metallica Premium) and I own a better 12" sub for my office and two transmission line subs in my living room. I know for a fact these are worth $100 in fact its the kind of purchase that you feel guilty about who didn't get paid on making this. Quality is great time will tell if it lasts but for now I'm as happy as any Metallica Pinball machine owner. This particular machine sounds horrible from the factory. $7500  (rock) game and I have to spend $100 to make it sound good. Take note Stern!
4,I've had it for a couple of weeks. I had to replace the woofers in my speaker cabinets (foam deterioration) and the new ones I got didn't have the bass oomph the originals did. The subwoofer did the trick - sounds solid. I'm using it about 50/50 for music (rock jazz classical) listening and TV/movie watching. I haven't really cranked it up to the max yet but I don't need something that can shake the paint off the walls. Until I need to annoy the neighbors who play faux-country music too loud that is.
5,If you're like me you're looking for a subwoofer that doesn't break the bank while enhancing your home movie watching experience. On the lower-end of the price spectrum the Polk Audio PSW10 10-incher certainly delivered what I wanted and then some. With a volume dial in the back of the box one can tailor the output desired for maximum viewing pleasure. Long story short this thing can really perform... You won't be disappointed.Personal story I had it set to my liking and watched TV like this for about two weeks until my wife decided that it was too intense. I had forgotten how to adjusts the output and was facing having to return it. After taking a look at it once more I realized the adjustable setting in the back. Since lowering the output we have a harmonious house once again and I'm able to live the dream of having a true home stereo to listen to music and watch blue-ray movies.
5,NIIIIIIICEEEE!!! I recently purchased a new AV receiver and my old sub had to go as the new receiver only had RCA out for subs. Who better to go with than Polk?! This thing is AMAZING! My last sub was also a 10 inch but this thing puts out far more sound and rumble. Its auto-on feature is great to save on power consumption but I also really enjoy the low-pass filter to ensure its only handling frequencies it should--really cleans up the sound in here. I only need one for my system but another nice touch is that you can adjust the phase on this if you were to setup two in your theater. Polk is the best get one!!
5,Controls my complete home theater system including DirecTV Denon receiver Samsung TV and Samsung Blu-Ray player. As I work out all the kinks I am discovering all sorts of new ways to involve the Fire TV cube in my overall Home Theater entertainment enjoyment.
5,Basics: Perfect for low end sound & clean clear bass; for your indoor sound system or home theater. Add to a mid to large size sound bar. Perfect for a 60" TV & larger (or a tad smaller). You will want to get an rca cable w/ a Y adapter for best results with a TV/sound bar. The sub has lots of its own setting options however if U have a receiver or sound bar it's best to set the sub & the middle settings & use the previously mentioned items to fine tune to your unique taste. The setup directions are very easy and intuitive. I was planning on making a lengthy review here. However there really are no downsides to this product & it performs flawlessly both with movies and music. Happy to answer any questions.
5,I'm not an audio expert but I have been really impressed by this subwoofer so far.  I'm using as part of a 5.1 surround setup with 5 Yamaha in-cieling speakers and a Yamaha receiver.  After calibrating via the receiver the sound coming out of this has been so smooth.  Maybe I've only experienced low quality speakers but compared to what I'm used to I was impressed that the bass was just "there".  it wasn't overpowering and there's no "punch" at all if you couldn't lay eyes on the woofer itself you wouldn't even be able to tell where it was located in the room.  Smooth.
5,Sound is good and i used it for my surround sound equipment.
5,I started with one and man was I impressed.  So impressed I purchased another just to have the extra horse power.  Totally worth it!  These are easily worth $250 or more.  Polk is selling them dirt cheap.  Best value in the lineup by far.
5,I don't normally write reviews because I'm not good with words but this sub has definitely exceeded my expectations. I use it with my PC setup because that's where I do most of my music listening. It's powered by a Sony receiver and teamed up with a pair of JBL ES20 bookshelf speakers. I set it up and haven't touched it since and this thing sounds AMAZING! Flawless no issues whatsoever. The only thing I noticed was the mesh cover on the front will rattle given the right amount of power and frequency of bass but that's super minor. I would recommend this to ANYONE looking for a decent sub for their room/living room setup.
5,It was bigger and heavier than expected and for the price it worked a lot better than expected.  This thing puts out serious deep rich bass and it's so strong I don't even mind my Grand-kids using it as a piece of furniture.  No cons at all.
5,I am not really an audiophile but this thing sounds good for $100. I built a decent sounding stereo on a budget. I decided to upgrade to this sub and it blew me away. I mean I have heard better but I have not heard better in this price range. It has it's own volume and bass level knob. It puts out some pretty serious bass. If you are thinking about upgrading your sub from one of the theater systems in a box or something like that this thing is a massive step up.
5,Hooked it up using a Pinnovators kit to my Iron Maiden pinball machine.  This thing rocks!  At first I had the volume up too high and the cutoff level too high as well took a bit to fin the sweet spot.  It's still a little bassy but that's why I bought it.  If you're playing the machine it sounds fantastic.  If you're sitting across the room it just gives you a headache.  Awesome!!  Run to the Hills!
5,First I'm a music lover not an audiophile. I added this subwoofer to my current setup that includes Polk TSx 110b bookshelf speakers. I have an entry level Yamaha receiver. It took some adjusting of the crossover and speaker volume control but I feel it blends very well. The bass feel clear and bright with my jazz and motown collections(vinyl). I picked it up for just under $80 during the holidays. I really don't think there is a better sub in that price range. Don't buy it if you are expecting  $1000 sounds quality. I would however  put it up against any other brand in the 200-400 range any day. It is a heavy speaker and appears very well made.
4,I'm no audio expert but I know what I like when I hear it. I do like to listen to music and I like to be immerse in the movies and games. This sub is pretty decent for the price and sounds loud and thunderous. There are times I 'm like is this thing on. Sometimes when a show or movie comes on the sub sounds really low. I think its because how that show or movie handles Dolby digital. I have it hooked to a ht system Anyways when a movie or show works it sounds great I was surprised I was expecting it to sound like someone banging two pots together in an empty dumpster. If your short for cash but you want something to amp your tv movies and games up get this for sure it's easy too hook up too and I don't know all that much about speakers.
5,Dang good subwoofer bought one in 2009 for my denon 7.1 ch stereo mostly for music as I love very loud music so loud you can't hear the person next to you yelling this sub performed astronomically for years and would still be pounding up til a week ago October 2017 my dang cats shredded the foam woofer surround just ordered another new psw10 to replace the original psw10 I'm going to try to replace the foam and have dual subs and see how long  This thing can be pushed so far 8 yrs and still as strong and crisp as the day I bought it  i strongly recommend this sub  polk performs!
5,This thing is MORE than capable for a personal bedroom which was intended use for this. So in that regard this subwoofer can't reach its maximum potential but for what I'm using it for is amazing. The bass has a very nice depth to it. For budget audiophiles this is one of the best drivers for the price.
5,just like others reviews....it's a bargain for the price...sounds great...you have to adjust it to your likeness
5,Yes you can go out and spend a lot more money and buy something that's 4 times as expensive or you can buy two of these. I have 2 and the base is out of control. The wife the kids everybody loves these base boxes.
5,Sooo much more power then the POS I had before!I moved to a real receiver and this sub after years of using a creative inspire 6.1 PC speaker system that mind you was nice for the cost and lasted years but the amp portion died and now I'm stepping up to a real system.I missed it when I originally purchased but this sub has left/right inputs not a single RCA input like I thought. It also has outputs for speakers if you wish to drive some off its amp which is a neat extra.I've only had this running for a few days and its amazing the difference in bass and power I hear in movies! Love it.it is rather large though compared to what I had so that took some re-arranging of furniture to fit it.
5,As of October 2012 this product appears to be in the process of being phased out for next year's models. That means you can find it for a record low price.It is bigger in person than I expected but that's my fault for not doing a better job visualizing it :) It works great for my entry-level surround sound. I had just replaced my receiver which only supported an active subwoofer (and my old one was passive) so I spent a couple weeks without a sub. I knew I was happy as soon as I used it for the first time it really added some depth to the acoustics even high range stuff like dialogue seems more realistic now.Check out the back panel picture for connections. Also be aware this model doesn't truly have LFE support but that didn't bother me and incidentally the manual tells you how to 'fake' LFE using the pass adjustments.5/5 for exceeding expectations.
4,The sound is good.  Works well for music and movies.  The appearance is beautiful.But I was hoping for a bit more.  I have always owned Sony Kenwood and Yamaha stereo equipment and thought my first venture into Polk would be revolutionizing... its about the same.. which doesn't mean its bad at all but there's no way its "way better" than a powered sub from yamaha.  Adding a powered sub to your home theater system will make a great difference.If  the price is about the same sure I'd buy this again over a Yamaha... but if they were both full price I'd buy the yamaha.
5,ok  this unit really puts out the bass!  Sound is very good and the connections are easy.  Go online and read how to setup so it mates with the output of your system.  This would be a great addition for the mid- to low/higher size unit/system.  The price was the major reason we purchased but were so surprised by the quality.
5,I was shopping for a subwoofer and had limited funds. This totally fit the bill! I use this primarily for watching TV and Movies. It is awesome! You won’t be disappointed! Polk did a really nice job with this sub. I don’t play it really loud and just adds the 3rd dimension to my surround sound. I have all mixed speakers and my system sounds amazing!
5,i've had this sub for over a year now and it held up so far. i haven't bought really any home system subs before this one so i cant recommended another brand. from my usage its worth the price as when its turned to 75% it rattles my room windows and makes the neighbors complain. (i tend to be respectful i only use it turned way up when showing it off)
4,I bought this for my garage to fill in the bottom end of some bookshelf type speakers.  It does the job well and so far I have no complaints about the sound.  I wasn't going for audiophile quality in the garage but there is no reason to think this wouldn't work fine for a small to midsize system in the house.  The one thing that I didn't care for on this product was the design of the grill.  It's made of some kind of curved plastic covered with fabric instead of a rigid frame of wood.  Aesthetically it looks alright but the grill is open on the top and bottom (not flush to the speaker face) so the value of the grill as a dust shield is impacted.  If you use this sub indoors instead of a dusty garage that point should be of little consequence to you.
5,I found this sub to be a great deal for the doe. I was replacing an older but much more expensive 12 inch sub. This sub sounds much better. Very punchy and crisp. No muffled bass clean and crisp. I have a Denon amp driving large floor speakers and large book shelves for rear. Its like getting a whole new system for me. I set all to 80Hz and the bass fits like a glove. All the power you need. I do have a smaller room but its open on one side. I am very please and would totally recommend this sub.
5,This is the best $100 I ever spent on music equipment I’m normally a Sonos or Bose type person and I needed an extra sub for my ceiling speakers I was totally blown away in how this sub performs put my other expensive subs to shame if u want bass get one ty Polk for making this cost efficient sub would def recommend it 100000% I’m just amazed on bass and quality
5,Awesome bass and easy to install.  Really impressive sound.  Just buy it.
5,I bought this to replace an old JBL 250 Watt 10" sub that I had over 10 years. That one cost me $250 back in the day on sale. This one I got for $89 two months ago! I like the size finish is nice (even though it is behind the couch!) and the sound is good.The bass is not the lowest that I have heard but to get response down at +/-3 dB from the low 20's you have to pay a lot! I knew what I was going to get so my review is relative to that. Bass can be a bit boomy but can be trimmed pretty well between the controls on the unit and the Receiver. It works fine for DTS and HD movies which was my intent.You can spend a whole lot on subwoofers these days with mixed results. I trust Polk as I have had many speakers including in-ceiling pairs that have worked very well for many years. A great brand and if you can find deals very affordable.
5,I received an Onkyo CS-445 as a requested birthday gift from my wife and while I was shopping for a new stereo unit for my shop I noticed that many had recommended this Sub as a nice complement to the system. I must say I agree. This Sub allows you to get full rich sound even at low listening levels. Setup was easy and you can tune it for natural or rock-the-house sound in seconds. Most of the music I listen to is of a Christian nature and some of it remixes. On normal songs it will produce wonderful bass lines and the unmistakable thump of the kick drum. On remixes it adds great color to the tracks and a low note on a synthesizer will get right into your soul.My system is as follows... Onkyo CS-445 Bose 141 Bookshelf Speakers PSW10 Subwoofer.
5,the sound is adjustable both volume and intensity. it has made it possible to divert the bass signal from my speakers so the speakers can used to play the mid and highs that they do best. overall better sound without straining the speakers to produce enough bass for my listening pleasure. AND the price was right.
4,Do the job
5,One sentence buy it!!!! Shakes the room nice rich lows perfect for your home theater and powerful for music. I have purchased two.
5,Definitely an increase in bass having two psw10's.  Recommend two of these sub's to complete a Polk home theater setup
5,Purchased this for a new movie room. Paired with a new Yamaha amp. Very satisfied with the performance especially for the price. It really does add to the sound experience. It has an auto-on feature from standby (detects signal and turns on...turns off after 15 minutes of no signal). It has customizable levels as well as cross-over frequency. I run it direct via RCA cable from the amp and it detects the signal without issue. The 10" is the perfect size for roughly 13'x12' movie room.  Have Polk in-wall speakers as well and they are just as nice. Quality gear.
5,What was I expecting for the price to be honest a little more bass to fill out my sound bar. Well it has fulfilled that need and more. You can feel this in the floor works great with Alexa TV and especially like the music sound now. My XM/Sirus is connected to my Alexa and it sounds great. It is not going to give you breathtaking bass but for sure you will feel it in the floor and your chairs. Watched Jurrasic Park first night and it was a new experience to our living room. Would recommend this !!!
4,I bought the psw 12” but it did not last. I called Polk because it had a 5years warranty they were giving me stories.In spite of all that I did like the product.
4,Very well built and great sound quality just wish it had a bit more power. I will say this though at least polk didnt lie about the power output i tested it its exactly 100.7 watts peaks and 50.9 rms on mine. Being ten inches it will last forever with that limited power could be more powerful but still sounds amazing and for the price its stupid cheap yet durable and fills rooms with bass.
5,built very well for this pricepoint.....great for small to medium sized roomsget two and stuff them in the corner and watch the walls shake.
5,Great subwoofer because it's a Polk!My Atlantic Technology 172 subwoofer was making boom/click sounds between scenes. I thought it was my nrw Onkyo receiver and did process of elimination (replaced cables reset called factory service at Onkyo and Atlantic  Technology etc). Only option left was to try another subwoofer so I bought the Polk.I am glad I did. My 172's were due for retirement as they were almost 15 years old.  I have had Polk speakers before and enjoyed them for their sound and reputation.  This Polk subwoofer is wonderful.  I just wish there were more Atmos enabled films out for my 5.1.2 setup.Great sound and value!
4,Since I was used to a subwoofer that had 3x the power and was bigger and paid for it not a fair comparison.  Have to say for the $  it does a nice job of giving me the add'l bass that I was needing without spending a lot of $.  This is a nice gap purchase til I upgrade whole system.
5,Definitely love the clarity.  Replaced an older yamaha and there's no comparison.  Watched the Pacific and my wife came down to ask if the war was happening in the gameroom.
5,I fail to see how these things can cost hundreds of dollars. I'm not a gamer or get a thrill by window rattling bass. I just wanted that little extra oomph in my 7.2 receiver (no I'm not going to add another subwoofer). With fairly little tinkering I found just the right setting and now there is more depth and dimension in my sound system. Nothing real obvious but just enough to add to the overall experience. This subwoofer at less than $100 works beautifully. Why pay more?
5,I bought this as a replacement for an old sub that I had in my media room. This definitely kicks the sound up. It makes the movies seem more immersive with the sound. I love it!
5,My fault completely. did not read what was in the receiver as far as hookups jacks. Yamaha R-N303 does not support sub wolfer plug ins. If you want sub wolfer with this receiver go wireless bluetooth  wireless speakers and sub wolfer.
5,My hubby picked this out for me for my computer.  It's just wonderful!!!  The sound is great!!  Only problem.......I'm sitting here listening to music way more than I should be.
5,I have always been a fan of Polk audio and have used their products for years both for mobile and home theater applications for myself as well as customers. This subwoofer is no exception and the first one I recommend when installing/upgrading home theater systems in peoples homes. My most recent application of this sub was to replace one from a home theater in a box kit because the receiver was being upgraded (to a Pioneer VSX-920-K which is also great) and the original sub was only passive. This sub and receiver combo really brought the system to life (which still has the small 5 Samsung speakers from the kit) with its nice clean bass notes and punchy power. It is not boomy or annoying. Perfect for a small to medium sized living room or home theater for all uses including watching TV movies and gaming. The quality and performance of this sub alone has prompted the customer to want to upgrade the rest of their system to Polk speakers just like my personal theater and living room have.
4,Some good deep bass but also some small buzzing sometimes during very bassier scenes
5,well as the thousands have reviewed this sub before me I can only say that everything that was said is true and then some. I have been thru 3 prior subs in the 200-300 price range and the polk does not disappoint. I only use the sub mostly for music and along with my polk RTI bookshelfs in a 2-channel system this sub is fantastic! no regrets here! lows are deep and not boomy and overall sound is superb. just enough to take my music to the next level. more than enough without breaking the bank. thanks polk and amazon!!
5,Great sound and tone is perfectly adjustable. I can make the pictures on the wall shake and I can feel it in the recliner. Love my new Polk subwoofer.
5,I've never written a review before for anything bought on Amazon.  Felt I should this go around though.I bought the Grace GDI-BTAR513 amp Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofer and Micca MB42X bookshelp speakers.  I could not be more pleased.  The Micca's sound great! the PSW10 adds a ton of bass! and the amp does a great job pushing the music.  I have had no bluetooth issues or shutdown issues with the amp that others have mentioned.  Very satisfied with this purchase.  I bought all of this for my office hooked up to my gaming PC and bluetooth connected to Amazon Echo.  Great setup!
5,Sounds great!!
4,Downsized from an older 12" sub to this Polk. As expected 10" thumps a bit quicker and crisper but unfortunately doesn't hit as low as my 12". Unit has a beautiful tone and will hit hard if turned up but having it for music only paired with ceiling speakers that might be a poor purchaser decision. Overall for the price this sub sounds great and I can imagine would be better suited with a 5.1/7.1 theater type setup. Auto-on feature is definitely nice wood veneer is attractive (wish I had purchased that color instead). Stands up to the Polk brand - 4/5 stars.
5,I purchased this Sub as part of a low-cost sound system to be used in my garage- comprised of a computer 2 Micca MB42 satellite speakers and an SMSL SA50 tripath amp.  I spend a fair amount of time tinkering in my garage and am also a bit of an amateur audiophile so I researched extensively to find a low-cost but good-sounding solution.  For less than $250 (minus computer) I am impressed with this setup.After reading many of the reviews here on Amazon I decided on the Polk PSW10 Sub.  I must say it does not disappoint!  This build quality appears to be very solid and produces rich deep lows which compliment my satellite speakers well.  The value is quite impressive for $100 and I would highly recommend this Sub.
5,For anyone reading this checkout the bottom picture shown this unit has a black cover over the front of the unit so you don't see the speaker! Of all the subwoofers I have purchased this is the best because. 1) it can be left switched on as it powers down automatically when no signal is detected. 2) the power cord is 9ft 3in long so actually reaches my power socket without an extension cord. 3) takes many kinds of input ( I just wanted LFE ). Best of all the 10 inch woofer adds so much realism to movies and music to my 5.1 living room receiver
5,Great speaker.  Simple to setup and works well on a 5.2 or 7.2 setup  Make sure you get a single male rca to dual male (left and right) rca cable.  this wasn't in the product write up on the page when I bought it.  But not a big deal.
5,I installed the subwoofer as part of my surround sound system as a replacement for another subwoofer that no longer was working.  It was easy to install and adjust.  Provides plenty of base for my needs and is a great compliment to my system for movies and music.
5,Hits like a champ and sounds awesome. I will definitely buy another one if it continues to hold up. I hope this thing lasts for years to come.
5,I have this 10 in Polk a 12 inch Polk and a cerwin vega 15 inch. I would say you should buy the 12 inch Polk over all of them. Pay a little extra ($80 more) and get a much better unit. The 12 In Polk is better than my 15 in Vega. This is a once every ten year purchase treat yourself or wait till next month to have some spare cash. I still give this little guy a 5 star though it is in my smallest theatre system room (16 by 16 ft). For $100 you can make your system OK to AWESOME. For $180 you can blow your NEIGHBORS mind...
4,I paired this with a set of Vantaloo Zero's and wow perfect sound pairing.
5,Got this to go with my audioengine a5+ setup. Really happy with this sub it's overkill for my bedroom and larger than I expected but the bass is powerful and clear. I don't have the gain turned up very much since it's right below my desk but I can make out the bass in a mix very clearly. I thought my a5+'s sounded good before but the addition of this sub has really elevated the sound I have a newfound appreciation for a lot of songs in my playlist as well as spine tingling effects in games and films. Highly recommended.
5,Ordered this sub to go with a pair of bookshelf speakers my son and I built from a DIY kit.  I was amazed at what you can get for $100 from Polk these days.  It's nothing compared to my SVS subs in my main system but for most applications this is plenty of bottom end for a rock bottom price.
5,I have a pioneer vsx-d509s receiverAnd I have this hooked up to the sub pre out on the receiver and to the white RCA Jack on the back of the subwooferi have all speakers set to FL - CL - SL and the subwoofer set to SUBWFPLS.This subwoofer shook my room and the hallwaythis thing is great for medium sized rooms 14ft x 10ft wide or similar/slightly larger or smallerany larger than that and you'll have to purchase a more powerful subwooferIf I had more money I would purchase a sealed subwoofer to compliment this ported subwooferFor anyone looking for a subwoofer I recommend this sub andI also recommend setting the low pass filter on the sub to 120hz which is always recommended whichever sub you look for no matter which brand.
5,We needed some simple way to add some low end to a Halloween project and this worked well. It is cheap and self powered so all we had to do was run an extra bit of speaker wire to this subwoofer then the normal speakers out of there. It can provide far more bass than we needed.I also tested it in the livingroom hooked up via RCA cables to a DVD player. It produced way more bass than I would ever be able to play without upsetting the neighbors. Above expectations.
4,This sub is okay but it didn't live up to my expectations.  I purchased it for my 5.1 surround sound set up and I feel it doesn't create a rich complex range of bass.  My last setup had a Sony 8" and it created a much more dynamic feel.  It still sounds okay but I somewhat regret my purchase.  I also wasn't expecting it to have adjustable settings on the speaker itself.  I thought everybody controls their speakers through their receivers. I followed some instructions I read regarding settings on the speaker and settings on my receiver but it still isn't quite what I was wanting.
5,I was very surprised this sub puts out as much bass as it does. the auto on off function works great and it is a really nice addition to my 5.1 surroun.I will buy a 2nd one in the future when I'm ready to upgrade to 5.2I currently live in an apartment and my neighbors would hate me if upgraded before I move into a house.
5,Great way to add bass to a beginner home theater.  Makes such a difference on the movies you watch.
5,I use this with a very cheap pair of bookshelf speakers and a little digital bluetooth amplifier/receiver that is the size of a deck of cards and the system ROCKS. I also have in my home theater in a different part of the house 18" subs powered by 2 kilowatt sound reinforcement amplifiers. Can this sub hang with those guys? Not even close! But it is a huge improvement over the bookshelf speakers alone that makes for a great musical experience. A super great value and highly recommend.  Just don't expect to rock your house with depth charges from a movie and you will be happy.
3,We picked up 2 of these for our 9.2 home theater system. The bass was underwhelming at best. We spent a good hour testing them out with some of the best low frequency scenes from all our favorite movies. They did not create the low rumbling bass we expected based on the multitude of 5 star reviews this sub has received. The subs also seemed to having "breathing issues" as we called it with audible vent noise during periods of sustained low frequency. Extremely disappointed with performance but also remember that this sub is 50 watts RMS with 100 peak power. We ended up getting Polk's PSW505 which created some of the richest grumbling bass and perfect floor shaking sound we've heard in a home theater setup and we've only turned it up halfway! Definitely was worth the extra $100 to upgrade to a 300W RMS sub! Love polk but we were not a fan of this subwoofer especially for the deep rumbling of a home theater setup.
5,PSW10 is a tiny powerhouse. This replaced a 90W Sony 12" sub that I'd had for 15+ years and I can say that at 50W this one is just as loud. Tight clean punchy bass. My only complaint is that the PSW10 doesn't have an LFE input. It has an L/R composite (red/white) input which is cool for older systems but dont worry. You can run your sub out coax into either one (or use a splitter) and it works fine. Crossover is from 80 to 160 Hz not a great response but gets the job done. You really can't go wrong with this little beast. WELLLLLL WORTH $100. I'd pay 250 for this quality easy.
4,If you were lucky enough to get this for $100 then you will be very pleased for what you paid. It looks very clean and attractive and is relatively small for a ported box. The sound quality is great for frequencies down to about 40Hz. Below that the limited power/excursion and probably tuning causes the sub to really struggle to hit the really low bass notes (if your into hip/hop & rap this is where you should say dang!) Otherwise the sound is very smooth with the exception of port turbulence at certain frequencies you know that annoying noise that sounds like a piece of paper is flapping inside the box but this is typically only at really low frequencies anyway. All in all a great addition to a compact setup I use it for my surround bar home theatre system and is highly recommended for $100. For $200 it would get 3 stars!
5,I believe I made the right choice following the positive reviews this SW has  actually for my current Desktop environment it not only meets but exceeds my expectations I'm using the SMSL AD18 amp and don't be fooled this amp is rocking my SW like any other amp in the market sound quality is outstanding if I see another sale like this I'll buy another one for my hometheather lineup very happy with my new boom box.. Thank you
4,Bigger than anticipated.  Does good job  My dahlquist 8 does better
5,The 5* is for the speaker/subwoofer only. Sound and bass quality is great especially at this price point. The cable that is bundled with this item is NOT correct and should be the 1-male to 2-male RCA audio stereo subwoofer cable assuming that your receiver has a single RCA subwoofer output. The provided cable is compatible with the PSW12 but not the PSW10.
4,Solid bass for the size and price. I am happy. This will not blow your hair back though. It is perfect for a nice quality sound system especially if you have a wife who doesn't like it too loud like me. But when she is not home I like to pump up the jams. This is perfect for that scenario. I was hoping to feel some bass in the 1st floor where the woofer is on the second floor but no luck. It will not penetrate below the floor.
5,This subwoofer packs an enormous punch for its size. Makes my whole room shake. Doesn't even need a receiver to be functional. Paired with a vizio soundbar and two bose satellite speakers I have better than theater quality sound for watching movies in my room. This product performs exceptionally well and not only that but polk customer service is amazing! I had a problem as my amplifier for this subwoofer went out after 3 years of use and Polk sent me a replacement with no strings attached. Replacing it was a piece of cake as I only had to unscrew and plug in and out the parts. Truly an outstanding product and company.
5,2nd one of these I bough in a 3 month period.  First one got fried in a lightening.  Strange that my amplifier and other speakers weren't affected only the subwoofer.  Also fried my TV and Roku unit in the same hit.  Other than that it sounds ok.
5,Well its a it is larger than the old Polk sub woofer but that's ok because it produces very good bass notes & background sounds like car engines etc. are so realistic. I have to give kudos to Polk Audio because I bought a surround sound system over 18 years ago & everything other that the tuner is original equipment.  Quality sure does tell. I expect this sub woofer to perform equally well into the future.  Very happy with the product.
5,Ok!!
5,I just received it a few hours ago. I have it connected to my  Denon AVR. The sub is fabulous. Sounds great good bass. The only thing I wish is if they had one with a sealed enclosure. Because I sealed the port on mine it sounds 5x better. It produces a lot more bass. (Actually is so good I bought a second one)
5,I bought this sub to replace the one that came with my Pioneer surround sound system that's about 5 years old. That one was tinny weak and something vibrated inside the box too frequently to overlook. This Polk sub is about twice the size connected easily with some re-routing of the speaker wires and man it kicks! I have floor to ceiling windows in my living room and they vibrate if I turn this up past one-third on its volume knob. The sound is so clear rich and deep. It's like I got a whole new sound system. I am thrilled with this purchase. Should have done it sooner.
5,Perfect addition to my vintage surround system.  Built a video room and set up my marantz system then added this subwoofer for the finishing touch. A lot of bang for the buck.
5,Hello FriendsThis Polk Audio PSW10 sub is a nice room warmer for that little extra bass you need to upgrade a small stereo. It's NOT going to produce 'chest pounding bass' with the 100w amp. Good for surround sound and the effects sub....IN A SMALL ROOM. AGAIN the 100w amp ain't gonna cut it.The PSW12 will do that. The PSW10 produces a pleasant addition of nice solid bass good for the pop music sound and the sub-bass frequencies in that music. Running a vintage audio system with a tube 30w amp and a Yamaha YP-D8 TT Ortofon mag cart.Loud pounding hip-hop ain't gonna play the way you want with this speaker.
5,Bought this for downstairs for the theatre system and it is a great subwoofer for the price and the bass is perfect for a small room add 2 if you have the hookup.
5,Great upgrade over the two mid size bookshelf speakers (Bose 201's) which it is working will.  Adds a lot of life to the sound of an ok system at a very reasonable price.  It is a lot of bass for a rather small room but don't expect it to fill a concert hall. On a test CD there was no audible response at 30hz.  It becomes audible at 40hz.  Pretty good output at 50hz. It is not a real low end thumper.  I only wish it had a single input RCA rather than having to use a cable splitter.
5,This little 10" replaced my now deceased 15" high end subwoofer. This is superior to  a unit I spent over $1500 on. The base is incredible. You feel it all through your body. And it is subtle when it should be.I highly recommend this subwoofer. We run a simple 5.1 in a 20' x 24' room and it rocks!
5,Bass is really good and for the price you can’t beat that.
5,One of my old subwoofers was "Insignia" and lasted me about 3 years finally hit the dirt. I needed a decent subwoofer that was not gonna cost an arm and a leg. This one seemed promising so I gave it a shot The bass quality is amazing and the whole casing seems pretty solid. No vibrations or small rattlings that you hear on other subwoofers of cheaper or same value. Glad I gave this a shot. I will make an updated review once it reaches 1 year. I have had it for about 2 months. Overall a good solid purchase! :)
5,I bought this speaker as a replacement. It preforms quite well and is easy to install and adjust. I would suggest using a "Y" cable for connection to a receiver with a single sub output. ....otherwise the crossover frequency needs to be set to the lowest setting. Overall a good value.
5,This replaced a RCA subwoofer that was powered by the receiver itself.  Though the power supposedly was about the same in terms of whats this sounds amazing compared to what I had before.  It adds such power!  I have home theater in my basement that has concrete floors and cinder block walls and is the room is about 12 feet deep and 15 feet wide.  Not huge but sufficient enough to have a 12 foot projected screen.  In any case this sub add some great power for the theater room I have.  It was much bigger than I thought and happy with that because when it comes to BASS size matters.
5,Money for value this subwoofer is great! I have two of them behind my main seating to supplement low frequency bass in my living room.Thump thump.
5,This little sub is awsome.  I had a problem with the input cable at first.  It ran next to a power cable and the system hummed when it wasn't getting a signal meaning the sub was on and the reciever was off.  The current from the nearby power cable kept the sub on when it was set to automatic.  I rerouted the input cable (and upgraded it to a shielded cable) and the hum went away.  I have an Onkyo 509 and some denon bookshelves a bose center channel and some in ceiling 5.25 rear surrounds in a small living room.  This is more than plenty for this setup.  The sub adds so much to the movie. I barely have the volume up because it shakes the whole house when somthing explodes on screen.  Great sub at a great price.  If you're and audiofile then why are you even reading a review about a $100 amp?
5,I bought this to compliment my outdoor music set up. I added this to my Bose speakers to make up for the bass they lack and it’s awesome.  Like night and day. A welcome addition to my set up. I absolutely love it! Very easy to set up !
4,GOOD PRODUCT AND SIZE. THE SOUND IS GOOD BUT THE BASS IS NOT AS CLEAN AS WOULD LIKE FOR A HOME THEATER. IT HAS A GOOD LOUD BASS BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN IT DOWN A LOT TO GET CLEAN BASS. IT IS DEF GOOD FOR A FAMILY/GREAT ROOM SURROUND SOUND.
5,I am very pleased with this sub for the money.  I upgraded from a smaller sony sub that was part of a 5.1 speaker set that came with my receiver.  The difference is night and day.  I purchased this sub for Christmas for $111 and it sounds great.  We have a decent sized carpeted living room and it fills it with good bass.  Like others said there is no direct LFE input but you just turn up the level knob all the way and you have an LFE input.  I only use the sub for movies and it sounds good.  Gun shots and explosions are much louder and would scare me at first because it is a loud clean bass.  you can but better subs but they cost alot more money.  I almost went with the sony sub that my friend has but am glad I went with this one.Amazon had the best price in town when I made my purchase.
5,Originally I planned to install in my bedroom with my older Sony receiver. When arrived was surprised on the size and quality look of it. Decided to switch off the Sony Subwoofer and connect with my Onkyo in the living room. Now for weeks long I was unhappy with the quality of the sound and turn up the volume up to 73-75 just to enjoy 9.2 surround system every time and change settings. WOW WOW STOP! No-one told me that Subwoofers are upscale all additional speakers quality in sounds on the system. Well picture a guy in slow motion jumping after butterflies from happiness. It's me now. Yeah baby. :)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This thing blew my expectations out of the water. I knew it was going to be a good purchase however it outdid what I needed it to do. The bass can be adjusted really well. It can be heavy & punch while maintaining a super clean deep sound without distorting. Alrhough the box is big & somewhat heavy it is incredibly well built & the finish on the cone is absolutely gorgeous.
5,I have a lot of Polk Audio equipment in my vehicle and this sub for my office was a great choice. It's built very well and sounds clean and deep. The volume and frequency controls work well too. This is an excellent buy for the price!
5,This unit has improved the total sound quality by 10X  excellent enhancement toMy system. It’s also super easy to set up.I am more than pleased for this purchase.
5,A/V company suggested a more expensive and powerful sub for my basement remodel.  I'm not an audiophile so I purchased this for the price and great reviews.  Figured I could always upgrade later but after a week I'm thinking I might not need to.  This sub is deceivingly powerful and does a great job filling my large basement and is only about halfway turned up.  If you are a regular user and are just looking for a decent sub to add to your sound system this is a good choice.  Maybe others are more picky but I'm pleased with my purchase.
5,Added some much needed bass to my Echo speakers throughout the house. At higher volume loses bass and become buzz but works for my needs good buy for price.
5,I ordered the Abramtek e600 portable bluetooth speaker after researching on-line for systems to enhance the sound quality of music generated by my Echo Plus.  I'm a bit of a bass fanatic though and wanted even more bass so I added a Polk PSW10 subwoofer to connect to the speaker.  Now that I have all three systems working together I am experiencing fantastic sound at an economical price!I highly recommend the Polk PSW10!!  This is an excellent subwoofer producing a high quality bass sound and doing so for under $100!!
5,replaced a 20 year old sub. what an improvement.
5,I've coveted this subwoofer ever since my old one (20+ years) blew up two years ago. The price has barely budged and I finally pulled the "one-click" trigger. In the first two weeks of owning it I'm not sorry a bit.The sound is mellow and unobtrusive but puts a dynamic "floor" under music that adds richness to everything I listen to. It's mated to Polk front and center speakers that I've owned for 13 years but still blends with them sonically perfectly. For a number of reasons I don't play my sound system at high volumes so I can't vouch for the PSW10's performance at high energy but for my use it's perfect. I suspect it will last longer than I do.
4,I was looking for an capable but inexpensive powered sub to match up with the Visio soundbar I have mated to my desktop computer -Something that would fill out the very bottom of the already fine sounding unit when viewing movies and on-line videos or listening to music.None anywhere near the PSW10's pricepoint promised what I knew I could expect from Polk. And the PSW10 has more than lived up to my expectations.Solidly built. With all the controls one needs to match a sub to this or that set of speakers. An amazing 5 year warranty. And best of all Polk-quality sound. What's not to like?Thanks Amazon! :)
5,It works well has some good deep bass. Very good price. It's a little bulky but I put it behind my couch. I wish it had more to tune it to the way I want it. But if your just looking for a sub that will work with your system for either movies or playing music get this. I do like that it's a powered sub meaning you dont have to have an amp to run it. In some aspects I would take it over the Bose sub and at 1/6th the price.
5,For a 10” inch subwoofer sounds great in smaller rooms. If you have a bigger room get a 12”. But the bass sounds great. I have it set half way and it sounds impressive in my room which is Around 14 x 14 any room bigger than that get a 12”..
5,Sub sounds great replaced a blown JBL and sounds so much better. I have it turned almost all the way down and the wife asked if someone was outside bumping bass in their car so yeah it sounds great. Lots of adjustability and great sound quality
5,This was the most solid audio buy Ive found in a while. I love the versatility in that it can be ran though your powered output or a line out. There are 2 pots one for crossover frequency and one for volume. I use these when I'm watching an action/sci-fi movie after the kids go to bed - super easy. I've had it several months now with absolutely no issues or complaints.
4,Let me start by saying some of the reviews are just ridiculous. This is a entry level sub nothing super special and the pricing is low.  I connected this to my Denon AVR-S710W and it sound great in our home theater room. We have it as the main sub accenting a small sub for those subtle lowes. I have yet to fine tune it but so far so good. I gave it 4/5 stars because any item sold in 2016 should have everything you need to operate it and this doesn't come with a sub wire which is just useless.
5,I will preface this review by saying that I have never owned another surround sound system before this one. (Just purchased this in January 2017.) This purchase completed my system and I have to say that I love it. I was a bit concerned about not recognizing the name brand but I went on the price and the reviews. Not regretting it one bit. It can shake the room if I set it to do so but set at the right level I get perfect bass added to the surround sound. I highly recommend this product unless you are into a more pricier name and purchase. This was everything I had hoped it would be.
5,This PSW is a beast.... It does rumble my mid size room in mid level. It is very loud and kick with authority. On movies and TV the bass is way too much to appreciate dialogues and other Hi-Fi sounds. This is paired to a Yamaha ATS-1050-R and it does work perfectly if I tuned the bass dial to  - 2... But for music works like a charm! The bass is so strong that it does snap from time to time the front grill. I have noticed that the standoff feet are made of cheap plastic and they don't absorb the vibrations too well.... But for the price  it is a perfect buy!
5,Adding this subwoofer to my new home theatre system was a great idea.  Now I can feel all the base that makes a movie or great song come alive.  I have a smaller listening room so I'm sure this model can overwhelm it if I let it.  The settings on the back allow you to dial in the base (my setting is at less than 50%).  I liked this item so much I decided to get the Polk center channel next.  Very pleased with both decisions!
5,So sound and bass is amazing. Unfortunately it has started cutting in and out. On the sigbal source i had to turn bass and subwoffer all the way up to hear anything. Volume knob is set at half volume. Not sure if i would recommend. Not a bad buy for the money i just wish i knew why it was cutting out.
5,Honestly I really didn't read the description too much... saw the great reviews the great price and pretty much just ordered the thing. Upon receiving the box in the mail thought this thing would have been a small 12"x12"x12" size cube.  Needless to say the box was twice the size I expected.  I't's bigger than anticipated but plug it in and adjust the settings and this thing thumps! Had to play with the sub's volume to find the point where it doesn't overwhelm all the other sound.  This thing is great has fantastic sound and makes movies have a richer sound.There are other comments on here talking about the settings that pretty much help dial it in. For the price I would recommend this sub to anyone!
3,I waited for the Polk PSW10 to go on sale and grabbed it for $99. I don't know if it needs time to break in but I listened to this back to back with my Yamaha YST-SW216 (10" 50W) subwoofer and was rather disappointed. The  PSW10 can reach a slightly lower frequency range and with a bit more volume but sounds crass and not as clean throughout its range. I opted to keep the Yamaha in my living room and put the Polk in the garage paired with a set of powered bookshelf speakers that have a dedicated sub-out. It'll be good enough for a garage sub I guess.
5,When combined with an existing sub on a 7.2 set up it performs well. Let's just say my neighbors don't like it. But i love it!
2,The Sub sounds great paired with the Polk bookshelf speakers they are amazing for my home office setup. 2 Stars the speaker has an internal ground loop issue causing non-stop hum. I added a power conditioner no luck added a Ground Loop Isolator no luck. I reached out to Polk support for advice no help from the Polk Support Team. Now Amazon is having to replace the item hopefully this one has better electronics.Polk Support warranted 2 Stars for the effort. I would not recommend this product due to the poor Support Team. Additionally I would no longer recommend Polk Audio in general if this is their answer to a support team.Customer service is important if it doesn't exist there is no reason to be a customer.
5,For the price I paid ($99) you absolutely cannot beat the quality and volume of this baby. I expected something smaller but this thing weighs a lot. It did however fit perfectly underneath my computer tower.Setup was super super easy (I recommend either an audio receiver or high quality sound card).I really thought the bass would outpower my 40 watt digital monitors. they did not. (make sure you have at least a decent pair of monitors at the very least to match these).The bass is not over powering but very very clean and tight low end addition to my music. one of my best music gear purchases ever!!!!!Cons: I don't ever want to leave my living room.
4,PSW10 Sounds great. Bought it for stereo in garage to supplement Bose 101's. The RCA inputs are for left and right. If you have a mono sub out on the receiver you will need an RCA Y splitter to connect it. Or just use the speaker wire input and output.I ordered a single RCA cable and had to reorder the correct Y splitter cable.The PSW12 does not have this issue as it comes with a mono input. Not sure why the didn't include this on the 10 inch version.
2,I should have known not to trust this sub’s glowing reviews when I read that most users were coming from small form factor subs “home theater in box” subs or no sub at all. Sure in those cases this sub probably seems like a massive improvement but it’s not hard to improve on garbage. Compared to an ACTUAL good sub this thing does not even come close to delivering the “rich deep and powerful bass” that reviewers claim.The problem is that while the amp clearly has plenty of power the actual driver suffers from over excursion wayyy too early. Unfortunately that means that turning up the sub volume to the point where it finally seems to be coming alive (around 60%) also ends up making a distorted rattling mess of any frequency below 80hz or so.
5,This sub delivers. Wish I had more power from my main amp but that's not the sub's issue. It's a great enhancement to my system and you can't beat the price.
5,Love it! So easy to hook up and get sounding great! I have it paired with Elac 5.2 debuts and I’m in love with the sound I’m getting! Easy setup and you don’t need a subwoofer output on your receiver to use it!!!!!
5,I have two of these now in different rooms.  They're a fantastic value for the price.  The subwoofer is plenty powerful-- able to put out more bass than I would ever really want in a home theater setting so I keep them turned down a bit.In general it really makes a huge difference to the overall sound quality of the system
5,I recently replaced my Yamaha Yas 70 soundbar system with a new Yamaha 1070 soundbar...and quickly realized the old Yamaha sub would not work with the new soundbar.  Amazon to the rescue!  What a great price on this Polk Audio sub!  Delivered in 3 days....easy hook up...and booming bass unlike anything my old Yamaha sub ever put out.  Love the sub volume control on the back of the sub to easily adjust the amount of bass needed for music gaming or tv.  Alexa music never sounded better through this system!  Best purchase I have ever made!
5,For the price and sound quality you get from these woofers it simply can't b beat. I have 3 2 on either side of the TV and one behind the couch. Each turned to just before 1/2 volume and set to 80hz. They really make a movie come alive in your living room. Running them on a Sony STR-DH790 7.2 receiver.
4,You'd be better off getting the JBL or the Polk 12 inch model of course at 3 to 4 times the cost.  These only have a 50 watt amp in them and 50 watts doesn't go far driving subbass frequencies.  I am using them to supplement the low end for a pair of Alesis Monitor One Mk2 passives which are flat down to 35 Hz just like this sub but they just don't have the surface area to properly convey the lows to the listening position (my theory).  So I am running these at half volume and typically don't exceed 75 db.  Frequency response is good down to 35 per specs and works OK down to 30.
5,I have a decent-sized living room and this is more than adequate for movies and music. This thing can shake the house if you want it to.
5,Absolutely the best $100 I have ever spent on home electronic's... It replaced a Velodyne VA1012. The Velodyne was bought in 1993 and purchased for around $700. The Polk sub is much cleaner much tighter just the perfect amount of bass. I hear only bass coming from the sub instead of walls and doors vibrating like with the Velodyne. Just totally blown away with this Polk sub!
5,Home movies
5,This sub is absolutely unreal. For the price and size I had expectations. I expected it to be OK and get me by. I expected it to distort at high volumes. Every single expectation was shattered. This thing SLAMS. It sounds absolutely amazing. Instead of getting me by this is just the sub I'm happy with. Heck yeah
5,I wanted to upgrade my older sub bass. I found that this PSW10 10" subwoofer works great and did not break my bank! It has a nice solid low bass and the 10" speaker is wonderful.
5,I'm not an audio expert by any means but I know what insanely loud is. Given the price I wasn't expecting this much sound I think my neighbor might call the police on me soon. Granted it's day 1 there's plenty of time to get used to it but right now I wish I lived somewhere that I could go nuts. Might buy another just because.
5,I have a Sony receiver since I did not have no bass in my bedroom I decided to buy this subwoofer. This subwoofer will shake and rattle the place. Great subwoofer if you listen to Hip Hop. Polk audio is the best.👍👍👍
4,After a major snafu with my original order 3 weeks prior (Never actually shipped) Amazon Customer Service sent a new one. - Can't Fault the product for that i suppose.Works great sounds good does the job.As far as some of the other reviews..... You get what you pay for - This is a cheaper sub If you expect mind blowing sound you have un-realisitc expectations! That said we have a large living room with Denon Surround system and it works very well.
5,I think they sound just fine More bass then i need Shakes my bed at half volume.
5,Super clean punchy bass/subs.  Compliments my 100w bookshelf speakers perfectly.  Variable crossover volume control phase switch.  Unbeatable at this price point highly recommended.
5,This speaker is perfect.  I've had no problem amd it is plenty loud.
5,Thank you
5,Absolutely perfect for theater sound. Bass hits lower than I would’ve expected from a 10” and I could not be happier. Just like sitting in a movie theater.
5,Bought this for my new basement tv setup and couldn't be happier with all of my Polk speakers. When this bass is bumping you can see the glass of water vibrating on the coffee table upstairs. Very happy. Sounds great.
5,Love it.  Plenty of bass for my RV.  Paired it with a set of Dynasty ProAudio wireless audio transmitter/receiver to allow me to move the sub either inside or outside of the RV.  Get lots of complements on the sound quality.
5,I'm not any sort of expert audiophile but must say for what my opinion is worth I am very impressed by this box.  It just turned my tv room into a nightclub.  Gives just the right amount of soul to the sound.  The tones seem nice and low with some vibration but not buzzy just fills my 20'x12' room perfectly.  The unit is bigger than I pictured it but it has a black screen on the front so that helps it blend with the rest of my gear.  Works great with my Yamaha amp.  Three Cheers! (five stars)  Thanks to Polk I kept my budget under $400 for all my speakers plus the amp.  Got two Bose 161 bookshelfs for front + modified some Logitechs to hang and threw in an old Sony that was once a detachable from a boom box.  Works for me.
5,I recently built a two story covered dock with some partial solid walls for privacy and protection from the elements.  I mounted a pair of Polk Atrium 6 speakers up high in opposite corners. They sounded pretty good alone.  We added the sub a couple months later - stuck it in the corner with the walls.  It makes a remarkable difference.  Again the best $100ish I've spent on the dock. Sounds great!  I'd buy it again.
5,I love the sound quality of this subwoofer. I’m thinking about getting another one for my basement surround system
4,I was very impressed how this speaker complimented my other Polk Audio speakers.For the budget price and guality sound this sub can't be beat. Very powerful bass response and punch for an economical 10 in sub. Great for small to medium sized rooms....actually ended up buying 2!...BIG sound and value.
4,I am a Klipsch guy and have preferred to get two of their beautiful copper spun woofers but cost dictated a cheaper alternative.  In general I am very happy with these two 10-inch subs.  They are not as nice as others but for the price they are very enjoyable.  Having two of the is definitely well worth the extra $100 bucks as it smooths out the bass in every seat.  For the money these are great subs!
3,It's OK for bass. Maybe in a smaller room it would serve better. Our living room is large and high ceilings so the sound didn't have the walls close to bounce from.. Doesn't hit the low notes very well (it is a 10" so it's low HZ isn't as low as a larger speaker)
3,First of all you get what you pay for.Pros:This sub is pretty good for $100.  Solid case OK looks and it does sound better than those "all-in-one" systems that claim to have a sub using a underpowered 6" speaker. But that's about it.Cons:**First and foremost to all of those speaker designers out there please don't pair your sub amp with a speaker that clearly cannot not handle the power.  There's nothing worse in the world of speakers than the unmistakable "PoP" of a speaker that can't handle the power it was given.Now grant it I'm no audiophile but I was spoiled for years by my Velodyn Sub and Infinity bookshelf speakers that I mistakenly let someone "borrow" and haven't seen since.I just started replacing some of this equipment and let me tell you folks Polk is no Velodyn or Infinity.  My 8" Velodyn would run circles around this 10" Polk (both in sound quality and power) and I never could make it "PoP".  But then again... I paid almost $600 for the Velodyn... so again you get what pay for.So if you are on a recession budget like I am Polk will do but if you have the funds ...do yourself a favor and splurge for a better sub one that will easily (and with clarity) make your walls windows and entire room rattle without the "PoP" and still ask you "is that all you got buddy?".
4,Cabinet was a bit different from the sub I bought at the box store.  That is my only complaint.  Was supposed to be the same model but was NOT.  Controls etc. are all the same but the front is slightly different.  I added this to a high dollar setup so I was a bit disappointed in that.Other than that its a really good sub with decent base for a surround sound or even music!
5,I have a pair of Audioengine A2+ speakers that sound great but by virtue of their size just can't hit you with a low end that you can feel. This subwoofer completely fixed that; it exceeded my expectations and is an incredible value.
5,It was a nice addition to my home sound system.  Before I was running an duel 8" subs but they didn't have the punch or feel I was looking for. This 10" did the trick. I'm happy with it.
3,I think i'm still in the breaking in phase of this Sub. used it for one week then traveled for 2 weeks and returned and found that it sounded better but there is still a flappy distorted bass at the low end of certain bass intense movie scenes. I find that it handles music fairly well. It's hooked up and controlled by the Denon Avr-X540bt. So this produces very controlled bass not punchy but it fills the room (approx.18ft * 22ft). Overall rating 3 stars. It may be worth spending some extra dollars to get a tighter bass subwoofer but if you just want some modest bass without breaking the Bank then this could suffice.
5,My old subwoofer was dying so I looked at many subwoofer reviews.  I bought the PSW10 and it sounds great and for $99 it's a no-brainer.  I was looking at subwoofers in the $250 - $325 price range before noticing the PSW10.  It is a big box but that doesn't bother me.  After many months of use I still consider the PSW10 a bargain -- an excellent product at an affordable price.  I don't write many reviews but I wanted to write this one.
5,Holy cow!  I have a small Sony CMT EX1 (it is oooold) that has pretty great sound just no low end sitting in my home office (13x11).  Wired this sub up (14 gauge) using speaker level input turned the low pass up to about 120Hz left phase a 0 and it sounds sooo good!  I'm definitely someone who appreciates good sound and was thinking that this would just be a budget upgrade to a small system that doesn't get used that often.  I'm going to listen to this system more now than ever!
4,Very good for the price so an excellent value imo.  Doesn't get as deep nor have the output of my Paradigm subwoofer (at almost 6x the money) but adds significant bass output to my tertiary system in a small listening room.  Using with a Cambridge Audio Sonata receiver and RCA/Radio Shack small bookshelf speakers with the Linaeum tweeter.  This speaker has very good mids and highs but suffers from severe anemia in the bass;  the Polk subwoofer used judiciously really improves the sound adding dynamics along with the low end.  Not made for high SPLs but packs a nice punch when used within its capability.
5,Ok you don't want this if you have a $10000 home theater but for a smaller surround-sound system it works just fine.  I'm very happy with mine there is no distortion and in my small(ish) 20x30 room it does the job with no fuss.  It is attractively designed and looks much better than my previous black box sub-woofer.  It has multiple inputs so it should work with any AV receiver you have.  It even allows use of a second sub-woofer if you are so inclined (I'm not).
5,After weeks of adjusting the knobs on the back of this subwoofer and the levels on my stereo's equilizer I can't imagine life without this subwoofer. It took a while to get the crossover right. I wish it had more inputs.
5,Never bought Polk equipment in my life ... what a dumb mistake.  Subwoofer  performance is as good as units costing much more. Best hundred bucks I've ever spent.Build quality and style also great. I just listen to music - can't  comment on movie earthquakes affects and such.
5,Sounds amazing would recommend getting 2 if you have a larger room
5,Nice! Brought my bass back to life for movies and music!
2,Convinced by volume of sales and all of those good reviews I couldn't go wrong. It was delivered in two days as promised and I have been tinkering with this sub for days and days the sound is defiantly consistent it is constantly awful. I have double checked the settings again and again. I have tested this Sub with various movies but this sub is always bad. It distorts horribly and one is forced to over drive it to get anything worthy of an accompanying effect.... but when you do this those occasional moments of movie excitement such as the first time you see the T-rex in Jurassic Park the low pass peaks overwhelm the drive and it distorts to the point where one would believe the voice coil is about to burn itself out. Very disappointing. Important specifications to note about this drive. 1. It is only 50 watts RMS which is not a lot of RMS power. If your paying attention to any other output rating your fooling yourself. RMS is one of only two measurements that hold any value in the audio Worlds with the other being SPL but that number is rarely provided at this price level.2. Low end frequency response is limited to 35 Hz at best. The Human ear is capable of hearing 20 Hz to 20 KHz meaning this unit does not go down to the low frequency most would expect and it also struggles to deliver clean output at 35 Hz. On the plus side it is beautifully constructed and looks great for the money. Wish it performed as good as it looks.
5,The system I own that I bought this to add to:Pioneer VSX-822-K A/V ReceiverToshiba Blu-Ray playerSony 300 Disc CD playerPolk Audio M20s Tower speakersKenwood RS-610 Surround speakersAfter spending about 5 minutes getting the settings on the sub adjusted this sub woofer has totally transformed my listening experience. I've bought the majority of this system in the past 6 months to replace a 4 year old Sony system. The sound quality is tenfold what I was able to achieve with the Sony system and it was a pretty darn good system back when I bought it. This subwoofer does a fantastic job on CDs Blu-Ray concerts Movies.... Even my Cable TV sounds infinitely better. This is a GREAT subwoofer and the price is unbelievable. If you're thinking about buying it DO IT! You won't be disappointed. I highly recommend this product.
5,Replaced a 16 year old Infinity PS-10 that bit the dust (a while back it seems) and this was immediately noticeable once connected of what I've been missing.Nice packaging easy connection attractive.  Only downside made in China but tough to find something like this made in USA.
5,I have had these speakers for about a year now and they continue to perform very very well. The dynamic range of the base is sometimes unbelievable. While watching a movie with a lot of action and low range tones It really feels like the base is coming from the L and R front speakers. Note: that since I'm using a Sub I have set my L and R fronts to (SMALL) with a crossover setting that will allow the Sub to play most if not all of the base. At times I'll have to turn the Sub off to convince myself on the incredible sound transparence. All in all this was a great buy as I snagged it on a sale.
5,Nice subwoofer. We had a placement problem and needed to use a Bluetooth link to connect this to our system and we found the Amphony Ifinity link   iFinity Wireless Audio Transmitter/Receiver for Subwoofers and Surround Speakers         Both the sub and the Bluetooth link work great together. We had a full 5.1 surround system in our previous home but when we downsized and moved we couldn't take the subwoofer since it was built into the house between the floor joists under the living room.  This sub unfortunately won't replace its predecessor but it still does a respectable job with our now 3.1 surround system.
2,Nice looking.  Sounded good at first. Then if u put it to the test during movies and it makes the terrible chaufing noise from the port. It literally call your attention and very distracting during a movie. Couldn't deal with it. She had to go back. Traded in for a Dayton. Slightly more no port noise better bass and lower frequency can be heard much better. Would only recommend if only for music listeners. Not LFE movie lovers.
5,I'm not an audiophile by any means but enjoy having quality sound for my music and movies. I added this to my receiver and two polk bookshelf speakers and the combo is perfect for my small condo living room. Would definitely recommend adding a sub to your system if you don't have one and my buddy who's much more obsessed with this stuff recommended this specific sub to me and I have been happy. You can definitely get some for cheaper but $110 for something that you'll use all the time and will last for years if not decades seems plenty cheap to me.
5,Polk has yet to disappoint. Enough bass for rap but also pretty clean sound. You can’t get much better at this wattage if at all
3,Bought this three years ago. Finally Throwing it out. For Movies and casual use its great but if you start cranking it for parties or loud heaby bass music you will become annoyed with its clipping and distortion. Anything over 50% power is bad. Like I said its fine for The right situation. This is very cheap in the audio world so for most people its fine
4,I bought this as part of an audio upgrade and it does everything I had hoped. I am not an audiophile and didn't want to spend really big bucks but am pleasantly surprised at how well this speaker performs. Would recommend to anyone.
5,I haven't tried the speaker wire hookup but the RCA connection works great. The instruction manual comes with detailed instructions on how to tune volume low pass and phase shift settings. It caused my roommates to complain within ~20 minutes so I'd say it is great for the price haha. Tested with Audioengine A2 speakers. If you have a low-medium budget those + this sub are a great combo.
5,I was looking for something cheap to build my surround sound system and found this on sale. Much larger than I expected so check the dimensions. Sounds great and has a lot of features like a low pass filter which is necessary for a sub. Also includes black mesh cover so you don’t have to see the port
5,Needs a bit of work to find the right balance with the rest of the system. Boomy at times. I do wish I would have gotten a 12" though.  Satisfied for now! The cabinet is very nice quality.
5,What can I say I have been buying Polk Audio products since 1985 with the purchase of a set of Monitor 10's. As usual Polk delivers consistent quality for the money period. This sub in the average home setup will make you happy. I like the idea that I don't have to wonder if I made the right decision as far as sound as soon as you integrate Polk into your system you know you have made a good decision and its easy to show your friends and family that you simply cannot go wrong with Polk!
4,Needed to replace an old Advent 8" powered sub. After looking around and doing a little research I settled on this one. While I'd have to agree with a few of the negatives I've read regarding it's performance at very high volumes. For me it is a perfect fit!I don't normally listen at very high volumes. I do occasionaly turn up a movie loud enough that my girlfriend comments... "Is that loud enough you think?" If you're also one of these people I would say look no further. This sub performs very well for your average TV/DVD watcher. The response is good and the crossover and loudness adjustments work very well. It was a vast improvement over my old sub. I am more then pleased with my choice and I hope you will be as well!-Hoss
5,I bought two of these to have a balanced bass sound throughout my living room. Many of the top end speaker companies are recommending this setup. Wow what a difference! Instead of one firing from only one corner and sounding out of balance because its to strong or the opposite and not getting enough two balanced on each corner do a great job. I have to say it did take a few days to balance both with the variety of music & movies. Please keep in mind I'm not a bass freak but I do like depth to all that I listen to and watch.  Also they arrived very quickly and that's very important. One thing though don't go cheap on your cords. Otherwise you may get a humming sound like I did. I didnt go outrageously expensive but I didn't go to Wmart either. Good luck!
5,partnered with a couple of Bose 301 all tucked neatly away: great versatility and precision sound reproduction easily tailored to room source and listening levels.
5,If you want clean deep bass for movies keep saving up. This is best for a garage radio system or man cave radio nothing more. Now it might only be my unit but just giving my experience with the sub.
5,now at 50 watts rms there are those that would complain it is underpowered. uh-huh. i don't want enough root mean squared in the low end to cause genetic damage in pets or crack plaster. (i've seen Marshall amps do that). and besides I couldn't buy the PARTS for what i paid for this unit. and that's a fact. that weighed in the decision. i have found listening to it as this is written it is just enough. exactly right for this size room. anyone contemplating 5.1 pick this part carefully as the really hefty ones could overpower every other sound save for your rattling windows & the pressure waves rattling your guts and eardrums. the right ones add just enough to complete the sound you might be listening for. very compact also. a plus for anyone with limited space. just right.
5,This subwoofer doesn't disappoint forget about watts ratings because the volume on this thing is similar to a Sony subwoofer with 100 watts RMS. I had one 8" a few years ago and they're similar on volume levels. The quality on this sub is really good construction wise. Sound quality is also very good but the performance drops when going below 50hz from there up to 160hz it's great and clear (overall kick is great). The port noise is a small issue if playing loud bass or with the speaker cover on. Many people here that complain about port noise/ chuffing are probably using it without the grill on which helps reducing the noise. Not a deal breaker for me after paying $94 for it! Watch out for pricing here because this product has a roller coaster price mainly between $90 and $130.
5,I have a modest Onkyo receiver and 4 awesome Polk RT25i speakers and a Polk center.  I wanted to finally get a sub and this little unit is great.  I have about 250 sq ft in my basement and this sounds incredible.  Not sure about bigger rooms but for this size this set up is perfect.
3,Face cover rattles.... I got the unit delivered and immediately I hooked it up and started messing with the settings. Right away I heard the rattle coming from the sub so I removed the face cover and it was almost 100% gone but could still heard faint rattling. I adjusted my settings and I came to a happy medium to where it was almost completely gone and still sounded ok. Can't say I'm too happy about my purchase but I also don't wanna go though the hassle of returning it. If you can afford it spend a little more and go for a higher end sub.
5,Easy setup. Just follow the setup instructions on how to dial it in for your system. Sounds great.
5,I have owned many subwoofers from many brands - SVS Paradigm Klipsch. I have multiple hometheaters. For $100 this is the absolute best subwoofer you can buy! Of course its not perfect wont rattle the walls and floors wont ultra low frequencies. But for compact theaters and small rooms its perfect.If you **can't** afford the $200 Polk PSW505 then get this one. On occasion the price for this sub has dropped to $80 then you should buy two of them !But the Polk Audio PSW505 is better than two PSW10's but only if you can afford $200.
5,I'm not all that much of a pro and have never heard high end subs but this thing for $90 blew me away. If you're on the fence do it. My system was anemic prior to purchasing this but I had no clue until I joked up the PSW10. I leave it on about 2/3 volume because pictures were literally falling off my walls. I was looking for something cheap to tide me over until I could go all out but this thing is pretty amazing. I just want dual subs now!
3,10”?  Hmm.  I can’t believe they’re bigger ones. This thing sticks 17 inches out from the wall as you’ll see in the picture. Makes it hard to hide it under a standard shelf or cabinet. For such a large subwoofer box I would expect a slightly better residence. But you get what you pay for.  I am currently keeping it it does fill out the bass in my kitchen ceiling speakers  Plan accordingly For the large box size
5,Best subwoofer ever
5,Best bang for the buck! I refuse to spend thousands on surround sound yet I am an audiophile ....I have Polk OWM3s (you can pick up OWM3s here at Amazon for $100!!!) front and back a sweet infinity center and this beast on the ground in a big '22x22 room with a mid but very decent Onkyo receiver...I cannot believe the sound this sub kicks out..have no illusions 50 watts out of this sub is equal or better than pretty much any other sub I've heard! Low frequency is excellent..no mud..pure low sub...exactly what I wanted...crank the volume and I shake the earth! Perfect combo with my OWM3s! 5 stars for this beast!
5,This subwoofer is an incredible value for the money.  Having just installed Polk Audio RC85i and RC60 in-ceiling speakers I felt the sound was good but of course lacked an appropriate amount of bass.  I purchased this subwoofer to go along with my in-ceiling speakers and ran the 75 foot Mediabridge cable offered here on Amazon along with a Monster Y Adapter as the subwoofer requires two RCA inputs.  I was immediately blown away by the depth of the sound.  The sound produced is rich and warm.  The volume controls are appropriate.  It's more than enough subwoofer for my 25x25 living area and I typically keep the volume right at 50% on the subwoofer itself.  First experiences with Polk products and very happy.  The reviews are accurate and this product deserves a 5 star rating.
5,We just began building our home theater and was using one of our old JVC 8" subwoofers.  It was good but wasn't giving us the response we really wanted.  The Polk PSW10 combined with our Denon AVR S510BT made an absolute HUGE difference.  The bass response is a lot more clear and precise now.  the ability to set our frequency and phase allowed us to make the theater rumble as it should now.  Definitely a recommend for the price and value of what you get.
5,My amplifier comes with an auto tune feature that makes mixing painless. With the boomer setup with the surround sound I have theater quality sound.
5,I'm by no means an audiophile but for the money this is a great investment. I recommend it highly. As with any bass enhancement set it up with all settings neutral then use your amp controls. Rattles my Windows at a moderate volume.
4,My old sub went out so my quest began for a proper replacement. I have been a sound technician for many years so I was well acquainted with Polk Audio products. The sub arrived on time from Amazon and I had it connected to my home system that evening. We used several movies to test it and the sound was very well reproduced. On one or two of them it made our living room sound like an IMAX theater so even a veteran sound engineer can be impressed. I gave it four stars instead of five simply because some of the music sounded a little "boomy". Otherwise I am very pleased with this sub and will certainly keep it.
4,Easy to install!! Great sound!
5,I bought this to replace the Yamaha subwoofer that my son "stole" when he left for college this year.  I was just hoping for this Polk to sound "as good" but this was actually an improvement.  Easy to connect took me about 10 minutes.  The flexibility of the volume and high-cut allows for custom tailoring the sound to your specific system and room.
4,Hums when there is no input signal
5,It really rocks so hard as i expected. Sounds was so awesome.
5,Im sure there are better sub woofers out there but I doubt that there are any out there that can compete with the PSW-10 at its current price point. Great bass super simple setup. Turned up to its highest level there is no noticeable distortion or unwanted noise. Im currently using the PSW-10 with a Vizio SB202 40 inch sound bar. While it may not have the fullness that I get from my pieced together JBL 5.1 system it cost less then 1/5th what I have invested in it. Considering I paid less then 200 bucks for the SB202 and PSW-10 I cant complain. I definitely recommend anyone on the fence to buy it you wont be sorry. It makes movies and music sound so much better. The only thing I wish I could change was to give it a remote so I could adjust it without having to get off the couch!
5,I didn’t know what to expect with this purchase so I went in with no expectations. This sub blows me away. The clarity the deep end no rattle or hum and it hits hard. I had to go buy new speakers to keep up with it. Long story short love this sub. Sounds awesome from Biggie to James Taylor.
5,I have this in a 10X24 bedroom paired with 2 t-15 Polk bookshelf speakers and the sound is very satisfying.  I listen to music videos from the line out on my smart tv through a 75 watt per channel amp.  I am quite pleased.  It cannot compare with my living room system which has a 200 watt 15 inch Cerwin Vega sub but it cost about 1/5 as much so I got what I paid for.  I do recommend this for a smaller system.
4,Great sub for $100 - adds a nice punch and looks great but it gets pretty chuffy (wind-rushing noises coming out of the port) at medium-high volume with bassy music/explosions. I didn't expect this judging by the hefty size of the speaker cabinet but it's also only 50W RMS.If you're on a budget and need to spend $100 or less I absolutely recommend it. If you can spend more and think this will be enough you may wish you spent an extra $50.
4,I did not buy this for a fancy music system - although it would serve well in that capacity.I simply wanted to fill out the sound of my Vizio sound bar/Vizio TV for a very low price.The Polk subwoofer does that task admirably.  Just for fun I played a CD of Bach organ music through the BluRay player and the subwoofer made the performance sound spectacular--- hence my belief that this model would serve well in a serious music system.I experienced none of the "hum" issues that some have mentioned.  And the auto on/off works perfectly. I definitely got my money's worth with the Polk PSW 10.
5,Bought this for an enclosed screen porch. Hooked up to a Sonos connect amp inside vis SVS wireless transmitter and receiver. The speakers on the porch Definitive Technology AW6500 needed more punch. The Polk Audio PSW 10 added that and more. I've actually had to turn the bass down.
4,After spending 5 hours re arranging all my furniture to get the acoustics right I'm very happy with this sub It's powerful but not very punchy but a good pair of mids almost make up for it. A pair of them would be best for my set-up and probably most others I might get another in the future but for now Also this sub benefits GREATLY for am EQ at over 50% it's much better than the 300 watt Bose box I had
5,This little sub kicks. We had one at the house for over a year and liked it so much I got another one. Ran a longer cable to the side room and now the house shakes pretty good.The cats love sleeping in it for some reason too.
5,At lower volumes it is a fine sub for the money. If you want it for music it is very good...but could use more power for movies. A good unit at this price.
4,Ive had this subwoofer for about a year and a half now.  I has excellent deep base that I promise you will shake the walls in your home.  Now I dont mind other things rattling but the cover that fits over the front would rattle on a regular basis.  I removed the cover and it works as good as ever.  The sub is hidden in my home so Im not worried about its looks but I could see how this issue would upset others.  Either way 4 stars because the sub sound is great.
4,Bought This sub to replace an old unit that was popping at louder volumes for a medium sized living room setup. For the money it’s really hard to beat. The sound is very nice.  At loud volumes it tends to lose the tight sounds I prefer but normal volumes it’s great! I added some more sound deadening material to the inside and it helped tighten up the bass response.
5,More than what I needed for my computer - but I am loving it!
2,NOT magnetically shielded.  Do not place this near your television.  It has powerful magnets that could distort and ruin you TV.I was hoping to replace my old Polk PSW250 which was damaged due to a power surge from a lightning strike.Polk claims in their description on this website that they use the most advanced technology and construction methods (or something to that effect).  Really?  Your old speakers were always magnetically shielded but not your newer more technologically advanced ones?So it has to be at least eighteen inches away from any video monitor according to the documentation it came with.  That also makes it impractical to connect it using my preferred method which is to run the left and right speaker wires into the back set those speakers as large and let the sub filter out the low frequencies.  (Maybe their new subs can't do that well either.  I'll never know because I refuse to run wires back and forth between it and place it prominently in the room).  And it's not getting near my new television.Thanks Amazon for taking it back.  Polk you really let me down on this one.I can't speak to how well it augmented my sound system because I never hooked it up.  My old sub was great as long as I hooked it up as I had described.
5,I have a relatively small room/living room for my audio equipment - 12'x12'. This sub is the perfect complement for this size room. And I only run it at about 30%. I'm sure it would work in a larger room as well. Keep in mind I listen at moderate volume levels but could rattle the windows if needed.
5,Out performed my 12" Boston Acoustic. Much more hearable and feelable bass.
4,It's tempting to pump this up.  The level is rather impressive but it's easy to overdrive.  If you hear the farting sound back it off.
5,I would like to have a switch on the back of speaker. The switch's function is to turn-off the speakers ability to control cross-over points.
5,You’ll be amazed what this subwoofer can do. It sounds incredible great value.
4,Good enough for what you pay but pop off the manufacturer feet and just use felt pads. In the couple years I’ve had mine three of the four plastic feet have cracked or broken exposing the nailhead attachment - which scratched my wood floors before I noticed.
4,Adding a Subwoofer to your home theater system is a nice addition.  Likely if you are considering this subwoofer for about $100 you are not an audiophile or have a really expensive home theater system.This is a good entry level sub.  It won't blow the doors off your house but for the price it is a heck of a deal.  I hooked it up in my living room and it does the job.  You will certainly feel the vibrations and it does add a bit dramatic feel to movies.  I don't play our music loud enough to heard big thumping but it certainly could do this if you wanted.
5,I put together a make shift sound bar with a Polk TL2 center and 2 bookshelf polk T15 speakers with this woofer rounding it out.  its a budget system by far with the lowest end Denon receiver and friends that understand the sound system options out there better than my self do actually enjoy my pieced together sound bar.  If you're a casual budget minded sound enthusiast looking to add a little boom you can't go wrong here.  An audiophile's (they're the most annoying people on the planet) review with an in depth beating of this entry level subwoofer should be avoided and you probably shouldn't have them over to your house for movie night :)
5,Very nice subwoofer. Adds a punch to my home theater system. Instructions for adjusting it were lacking but I managed to find instructions on YouTube.
5,Great speaker a lot of bass for a 10 inch subwoofer
5,I like everything about this subwoofer! Big and powerful bass sound at a reasonable price. Very good addition to my system used primarily for music listening. This subwoofer is highly recommend for anyone looking to get one. Quality is on par with others that are almost twice the price!
5,First off.. If you have anything loose in your house; such as loose bolts screws floorboards etc.. This Sub-woofer will locate them instantly and rattle them. I live in a townhouse and I'm certain my neighbors can feel everything that this sub can produce. The Bass is so pure it melts everything in the room.. including your ears. It's very enjoyable to listen to on a lower volume and Hz setting; the bass is clear and detailed. But at the same time if you turn the Hz up it's able to produce a BOOM that vibes the FEELING of music.. literally.. through your feet or whatever your sitting on. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. When I saw it on Amazon for $89 I thought I had dyslexia or something. Buy it while the deal lasts!! It will be well worth your money!!!Listen to"Untroubled" by 123Mrkto TEST THE BASS!!! Amazing song..LINK: [...]
5,The sound is smooth and clear. I was not looking for a subwoofer to rattle the pictures of the wall. A big improvement over my old subwoofer that was way too boomy. I am using in a 20' by 20 ' room.
4,This replaced a higher end subwoofer I moved to another system. It seems to being the job just fine. If you are not into all the differences most humans can’t hear anyway this is a great value.
5,This is a great subwoofer especially if you're on a budget. Crystal clear sound and extremely satisfying
3,This sub is the quietest 100 watts I've ever been able to not hear
5,My son got this for my birthday and I love it!  After unboxing it I was surprised with how large it was but it still just fit under one of our end tables.  I certainly feels like good quality. I like the screen that came on it and I just don't think the picture does it justice.  I hooked it turned it on and just had to smile when I heard that beautiful bass.  I love the look and the sound.  After only a few minutes of using it I would recommend this!
4,Affordable and descent bass I'm very pleased!!!
5,This is a fantastic product that will not only make you enjoy the sound but to feel the sound even if the volume is not that loud. Besides of the fantastic sound it’s very elegant. Highly recommended.
4,It works fine for me
4,Works as should and appears to be good quality.
5,1st of all; check the dimensions of your sound setup area before purchasing the bass cube. This thing is MASSIVE! It works extremely well. I have it paired with my Polk N1 gaming soundbar and it rocks. You WILL need to purchase a RCA AMP OUT cable along with the cube as it does not come with one. The bass kicks hard though and there are plenty of adjustments in the back. There are also ports for speaker wires  if you're fortunate enough to have a surround system. I'm very happy with the purchase the price is great unlike those Bose ripoffs!
4,First of all let me say that this is a really inexpensive subwoofer. If this is all you can afford then buy it but I strongly recommend you save and buy a nicer sub. At low volumes it has a nice clean output but if you push it at all it really starts to get muddy and distorted. Right now im using this with an Onkyo TX-8555   Onkyo TX-8555 Stereo Receiver         and Klipsch RF-10 Speakers   Klipsch RF10 (ea) Dual 4.5-inch Reference Floorstanding Loudspeaker         and the overall sound is clean at low volumes but can get muddy and distorted once i push it. I would not recommend this sub to a friend because its output is simply not enough. I would save 150 more and buy the JBL 12" ES20 Sub. much better deal.
5,I have added this as my last piece of the 7.2.4 setup. It helped to push the sound to the next level. In fact more than I expected. Pleased with the purchase.
4,Hooks up easily.  However my old subwoofer had one RCA jack which was connected to another RCA jack in my Home Theater system.  But this one had two RCA jacks one for each channel.  I was going to buy a splitter but Best Buy told me that one channel was sufficient and that connecting both right and left channels would decrease the bass coming out because of the split in the channels.  The Polk also had connections for speaker jacks too but my speakers were already hooked up to my amplifier.  So all in all this was a good buy and a good product.  Still don't know why I didn't give it 5 stars.
5,I’ve owned many subwoofers over the years and I have to say this: this is not the most powerful or the better sounding one in the market but it sure gets the job done.It sounds pretty acceptable and the thump kicks you in the chest pretty decent on a small/medium room. Again not the best but FOR THE PRICE it deserves 5 stars!!I went and purchase 2 of these and now I feel the kick of the bass all over the room and I paid less than $200 on both.
5,This is an absolute awesome addition to my 20 yr old sound system playing primarily Vinyl and CD's.  Simple hookup to existing speaker wires and then simple output to existing bookshelf speakers.  Improved sound quality and punch 100% .  So glad I made this purchase!!!
4,This sub is an amazing bang (ha pun) for your buck.It's low end isn't SUPER punchy like my previous sub (RIP PSW505) but it gets the job done.I've noticed it has a low-end drop off where below a specific Frequency (Low probably 40-20Hz) it totally drops out and just moves a bunch of air with little to no sound.But that's to be expected with a Sub that's under $100.
5,I am no professional on sound systems but for the money this sub is awesome!!
5,Easy AF set up. Looks nice AF. Do yourself a favor and get a SW cable instead of wiring it with speaker wires it'll sound nice AF.
5,This sub is huge! I paired this with a Sony STRDH590 5.2 multi-channel 4k HDR AV Receiver with Bluetooth - Black and Sony SSCS5 3-Way 3-Driver Bookshelf Speaker System (Pair) - Black. It took some time to find the happy medium on the sub fine adjustments but once I did I'm very happy with how it sounds and hits.
5,Given the price I definitely wasn't expecting such outstanding bass/sound quality. This thing is working wonders for my gaming setup...
5,Incredible bang for the buck. I was concerned because it’s a LARGE room. This 10” sub does a great job even at 1/2 volume. My only qualm is there isn’t an LFE switch but turn the crossover to 160 and it’s the same (per Polk).
5,I had the Andrew Jones Pioneer 8" sub  and I liked it  but an eight didnt get nearly as close to the lows I wanted/needed so I took it back and ordered this. Of course a 12" or something with more power would fit my bill a little better but for the money I dont think I could have gotten a more satisfying item. I am not picky about "boomy" bass but even I had to keep volume knob around 50% to keep it from overpowering everything else. I am by no means an expert in fact I am going deaf but this sub is so good it makes me wanna slap my momma and tell her how perfect this is for me . In closing buy this sub if you like saving money and hearing/feeling a solid bass push from this glorious little box.
5,I feel this is a good Subwoofer for the money. I haven't used it very much yet but I am using it on the system I am using on my TV. I had an older model like this one and I really liked that one but the power board burned out.
5,This is my first subwoofer.  I have lived for many years with two large front speakers that had 15" woofers in them.  I have had the low frequency bass directed to them during that time.  Now that I have a subwoofer I can hear what I have been missing over those years.  The 10 inch subwoofer sounds really good to me but I have not owned one previously to have another one to compare this one to.  I enjoy this one so far.
3,The sound quality of the speaker is fantastic. Good deep bass. Clean sound. It only gets three stars from me because when it came in It wouldn’t power on when plugged in. I had to take it apart and separate some wire and correct a grounding issue. It’s worked so fine so far. But I feel it’s not something I should have to do to it straight outta the box. But then again it was only 125 bucks.
5,Initially I was surprised at the size of the shipping box and the sub inside.  It's a little too large!  But willing to live with it for the impressive sound it makes.  Would purchase again!  As a side bonus you could use it as a stool as it's a very strong wood box.
5,I bought this for my pc and oh my gosh!!! It sounds great!!! I had to buy a 3.5 to rca cable which was about 8 bucks and go into the audio settings in my windows 10 and man it rocks with my bose companion speakers!!! Highly recommend!!!
5,Wow! I was skeptical for the $100 price point but this thing is amazing! Completely changed the sound of my home theater set up. I paired this w my Onkyo receiver B&W bookshelf speakers and in ceiling surround speakers and WOW is all I can say. This will rattle your house with deep bass. I had to turn the volume down to 1/2 in order to keep pictures on the shelf :)Definitely recommend easily the best $100 I’ve spent on home theater equipment
5,I'm not a sound guru but this economical choice puts out some base.  I set this up with a new low end Sony receiver two old JBL stand up speakers an economical Polk center channel speaker and two polk ceiling speakers.  All together an economical system that kicks ass (in my non sound guru opinion).
5,I purchased this to replace a failing subwoofer.  This subwoofer totally out performs my expectations.  It fills the low end of music.  Has more power and volume than I needed.  It is wonderful having thumping music and rumbling movies again.This speaker is the best addition.
5,We had a tech that requested we order this item.  He made no complaints when he installed it.  Also this item is something that he frequently uses.
3,I have no idea how this gets such good reviews. Got this to give some oomph to my newly acquired Edifier R1850DB speakers which were fine but not very well defined. All this does is add a very loose low end with no definition or punch to the bass no matter how I set the crossover or bass levels on the Edifiers. Disappointing.
5,This thing is perfect compliment to your home stereo system. Have it hooked up for music and games. Due to the noise and vibration three stories down from my apartment I had to unplug the woofer but when I move this thing will be back up and pounding again. To clarify my neighbor knocked on my door. Volume was very low but he said that his lights and glasses were shaking in his apartment three levels down from me! Awesome! Made me happy but at the same time knew that I need to turn down/off. Great product as always from Polk!
5,I bought a pair of these to replace some old Sony towers that we've had forever and we are blown away by them. Our living room is not huge by any means but you can feel the lows when watching our favorite movies or playing video games with these. They are incredible and the price is very reasonable.
4,Great speaker don't let all the reviews fool you though. It's a great value for the money but I wouldn't use this for a semi-large room. It's perfect for my 12x10 bedroom. Along with my old sub you can feel the bass slightly while laying down watching a movie. Not very loud but it's expected. Didn't want to lose quality by backfiring. Great buy if you need an upgrade for a small room.
5,Perfect size and look. Edit: people who have less than expected experiences: please try ALL possible subwoofer amp and placement variations. I found it a bit too boomy first but later after some tweaks all is solid. Happy too to catch it below a Benny before the price went back to $129.00.
4,no cons use in 5.1 surround sound system
4,It was ok. For the money it is adequate and it gets the job done. It’s good for a small room.
4,I am not a true audiophile.  I am too frugal and my ears are not THAT sensitive but I do like good quality sound for the price.  This thing certainly delivers!  After my 18 month-old granddaughter did something to my old subwoofer to render it powerless this is a significantly better replacement than the Infinity model that came with my old set of speakers and works nicely with my Pioneer component system.  The only puzzling thing to me is that it has two outputs - L and R.  To my knowledge there is no use for two.  If anyone could explain this or how to hook it up (my receiver only has one subwoofer input) I wouild certainly appreciate it!
4,Can you get a better sub?  Sure.  Can you get one that is better for this price point?  Probably not.Note: consider whether you truly need 10" or 8" because this really does have quite a good low freq "thump" sound that may be more than what you bargained for or need for your setup.Read instructions online about how to determine the best placement for your sub as it will indeed pay off!Only downside of this product so far after a week of use is that it doesn't have a digital in :(  Had to use a Y piece to get signal sent from Receiver.
5,First shipment didn't work. Amazon sent replacement after technical support confirmed diagnosis. Easy enough to return. Second delivery works. Sub rocks as expected. Very happy with purchase and price.
4,It replaced an expensive but old and failing MK brand sub-woofer used for our stereo music system.  A difference can be heard but for the money it is acceptable.  It's just not super high fidelity.
5,This is really good for the price.  No it isn't the same as a $500 sub but I'm perfectly happy with it considering it was ~$100.  Puts out enough bass to make movies sound much better than before for sure.  Unless you are a real audiophile or have a BIG room then this should be fine.
5,Hooked up to a receiver in the garage with 8 ceiling mounted highs. Could definitely wake the neighbors if turned all the way up. Sounds great!
3,The sub sounds well as long as you use it at low volumes. If you crank up the volume to moderate to high levels you end up with a lot of distortion. The features are great: LPF phase shift switch auto shutdown. It is a great starter sub for small places. Don't buy it if you plan to push it to max volume though!
5,Sounds Great! I replaced a Mirage Sub with this one after the Mirage died. Very surprised at the sound. The Bass isn't obnoxious or thumping like a car base you can hear a mile away. It is subtle on music and produces bass and drums sounds very well. I got it on sale for $89 and don't believe you could touch this sound for twice the price.Now I have a Polk Center speaker and a Polk Sub. If and when I replace my other 4 speakers they will be Polk.
4,Bought two of these guys when they were at 80bucks a piece!! I priced around before purchase and saw on best buy they went for 200 for one and said alright gotta get two and these things are amazing they look great and for being so cheap I thought be alright... but they surprised me and listen to me and other reviewers when they mention the wattage 100 is just enough for these guys brands just through big numbers at you for higher payment my one complaint for not giving it a five is the real lows are not in reach of these but for the price expect a lot just not everything
4,I started with a Yamaha but opted for the Polk because it was $50 cheaper. I ran both in a series of tests and found that to the untrained ear there is not much difference. They both have a nice deep knock and handled different genres of music well. The only difference is that there is some rattle with the Polk because of the cheapish grill cover and on really really low bass notes instead of coming through distorted it just drops out however it was only noticeable in one song. I would definitely recommend the Polk to someone in the lower end of the market save the extra $50 the competing Yamaha did not live up to its more expensive price tag.
4,Just when my neighbors thought I couldn't be more obnoxious. THEN BAM. A NEW 10" SUBWOOFER GETS INSTALLED! I may have turned this thing up to Max yes... So maybe it could tenderize my body by it's beautiful vibrations a little... Which it did successfully by a lot....(Hey you looking at my review photos don't judge my cable management! I'm Workin on it..I just got this baby today ya know!)
5,Wow. I’ve been used to my old sub woofer and this one blew me away. The depth it adds to audio is remarkable. Very “punctuate” bass as opposed to a mere rumble. Highly recommend this product.
5,Very deep bass and powerful. It can distort when the stereo volume is high. But has a volume and bass knob to control the distortion
5,The only downside I have with this product is that it takes up a lot of space in the trunk of my hatchback where I use it. That being said: it's not supposed to be in the trunk of ANY vehicle! It's got great sound and you can control the HPF so you can fine-tune when this bad boy assists your other speakers. Great value for the money and saved me a lot on installing a sub in my car too
5,Great sub for the price.. hard to beat for the money. Don’t expect it to pound better then a expensive sub and you will love this sub.
4,This is very powerful system with good connection options and with good pricing. Got great bass that can shake the walls with some frequency and low pass adjustments. So far pleased with my purchase.
5,Great unite for serand system in TV room.
5,fifty watts of awesome.  I live in a small condo with travertine floors.  Sounds crisp and powerful.  Plenty of sound for my living room and kitchen. No noticeable unwanted resonance rattling or vibration.  I like the adjustable cross over and sound level controls.  My only complaint is that it's too loud with music if I  adjust the sound for the TV. An automatic attenuation circuit would be nice but too much to expect for $90 shipped.
5,Wow. Now I know what I was missing. Big enough to terrorize your neighbors. Has adjustable cross-over and volume. By removing the low range from smaller speakers they sound much better. Then by adding the low range to a powered sub-woofer the gain in overall audio satisfaction is profound. Loving it with movies. I'm a classic rock-jazz-classical kind of guy with an emphasis on the classical. Everything throughout the spectrum just comes alive.Plays well with Audessey (did I spell that right?). You really don't have to do much futzing. This is really simple and straightforward. Oh most people will require a Y jack - RCA female to two RCA male plugs.
5,Love the tight deep tone & the adjustable bass volume for getting that right amount of low end
5,This subwoofer added a lot to my sound system.  Currently I have a pair of Micca MB42X and a pair of some old pretty much nothing speakers.  I hadn't really noticed that they were lacking bass because they are so much better than laptop speakers and such I had been using previously.  But after reading reviews about how much a subwoofer added to a sound system I decided to take the plunge and purchase one.  It is like night and day.  Bookshelfs + Sub is the same kind of night and day improvement as bookshelfs to laptop speakers.  The sub really reaches down into the bass you don't know you're missing.
5,You are not going to beat this sub in the price range. Has RCA and speaker level in and out. I wasn't sure if this sub would be compatible with my audio setup. I've got a Hodge podge mix of stuff. The receiver is an older Kenwood surround sound but no sub out. I run my TV (streaming prime music) to the receiver then speaker wire from the receiver to the sub and from the sub to my left and right bookshelf speakers. This sub has way more thump than I will ever need. It's a bit bigger than it looks in the pictures but that's no big deal.
5,Sounds great. Easy hook up.  Wish was remote control  but other than that. Great addition to my sound bar for TV ! Tested it watch first scenes of the Greatest Showman and can hear the bass  Awesomeness
5,I’ve always liked a lot of bass when I listen to music. This subwoofer is huge and pounds out the bass. I was surprised at the size of the unit. Get this one....you won’t regret it.
5,Very good quality bass. Bass sound very tight and fast. Fit and finish seems good for price point. Excellent customer service is bonus. Highly recommend.
5,I have a lot of Polk Audio speakers and I've always been happy with them. When I found this one it was a no-brainer for the price! It has a lot of rumble and doesn't sound too "boomy".  It's also built really well. Nothing is rattling at all. Get this one you won't be disappointed.
5,Already had 1 decided to add another.  Excellent sound production for a Home Theater setup.
4,This is a very decent entry level subwoofer. For a small to medium size room it will work awesome. Mi room is 14' X 17' with 12' ceiling and it fills the room nicely.
5,5 stars principally because of cost/warranty. I purchased one to augment a set of Infinity Primus speakers in our library used mainly for background music and some TV.  Our home built in 1728 is solid stone and the walls of the library not covered with bookshelves are exposed stone...hence they present a very bright soundstage. While the Polk's upped the bass content of the Infinity's the bass was contrary to popular views noticeably directional. To balance the sound image I've ordered a second PSW 10 to null out the directional quirk. While they extend the depth of the bass image one ought not expect punchy tight or deep base from the Polk's. However given their cost they are a very good buy.
4,Sub sounds great. Does not show from pictures but front grill is bowed forward. Not sure why. Kinda looks funny.
5,This adds a real dimension to the sound of even an excellent amplifier and good speakers."Auto On & Off" feature means you don't have to turn this off or on separately. Even at moderate sound levels this substantially adds the needed low tones of the spectrum. I would have preferred an 8" version but Polk's 8" is different. The unit comes with a nice cover over the speaker which is easily removed. This can be driven from speak wire connections or from a Subwoofer Output from an amp. The cross-over in the unit will then feed the higher frequencies to another speaker.
4,I ordered this to replace a 15 year old model from a different manufacturer that finally died.  I use it in a home theater.  I wasn’t looking for bass to shatter the windows and I don’t use it for music.  For my purposes this was a great deal.
4,THIS SUB LOOKS NICE AND SOUND GREAT AT LOW VOL AT HIGHER VOLUMES IT MAKES A POT NOISE THEN AFTER WAS ABLE TO DO SOME MODS TO MAKE THIS SOUND BETTER AND DEEPER THEN BEFORE AND GET RID OF POT NOISE TO A POINT..ONLY TIME IT MAKES POT NOISE IS AT VERY HIGH VOLUME ON MY RECVICER.. NOW AM ABLE TO ENJOY MUSIC WITH THAT DEEP BASS AND WHEN AM AT VOLUME 7 STUFF ON MY WALL WILL START TO SHAKE I HAVE THE VOLUME ON SUB AT ALMOST MAX..SOUNDS GOOD AT VOLUME 7 OR BELOW ON RECIVER ABOVE THAT IT WILL CUT OUT. I THINK AM PUMPING TOO MUCH WATTS IN IT..USING PIONEER VSX D1S LOVE IT!!..GOOD STARTER SUB LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WITH A LITTLE MORE KICK TO IT
5,Wow.  This is a great little subwoofer.  Considering this sub only cost around 100 bucks is awesome.  I am listening to it right now.  It's got the punch you can feel in your chest.  If I had one minor complaint and that would be it's sorta limited on the bottom end of frequency's.  while it gets pretty low it does have a limit.  But for the cost you can't get a better value.  It is punching about it's weight class.
5,This sub replaced a much more expensive sub in my home theater.  That one only lasted a year before it just quit working.  This one was a great value and has performed flawlessly for 6 months.
5,For the price it really can't be beat.
5,The Polk PSW10 is awesome addition to my 5.1 home theater system!!!Polk floor standing speaker TSi300Pioneer VSX-530-K 5.1 Channel AV Receiver with Dolby True HD & Built-In Bluetooth WirelessHDMI Cable 6ft - HDMI 2.0 (4K) Ready - 28AWG Braided Cord - High Speed 18Gbps - Gold Plated Connectors - Ethernet Audio Return - Video 4K 2160p HD 1Panasonic center channel & rear surround speakersPanasonic Tough Book CF-31 with HDMI output to Pioneer VSX-530-K..(True Smart TV)Mediabridge ULTRA Series Subwoofer Cable (8 Feet) - Dual Shielded with Gold Plated RCA to RCA Connectors - BlackAmazonBasics 16-Gauge Speaker Wire - 100 Feet
5,The bass on this thing is incredible ( just don't turn it up to max and blow it up-- as with any piece of audio ). I have neighbors  so I constantly have to turn the volume down as much as it hurts to do that 😂😂
5,I only use this subwoofer for mixing/mastering when I want to hear what's rolling around in that low end.  90% of the time I mix/master on my Rokit 5 speakers only but when I need to hear a little more of that low end frequency I turn this subwoofer on and it does a fine job.  Probably not the greatest subwoofer ever but what an incredible value!  I hook it up to my Surface Pro with a Behringer UM2.
5,Great sound  easy to use
5,Really great bass sound that I was looking for to add to my stereo system.  No issues so far. I like all the separate controls for this unit on the speaker back panel. Nice addition to sound
5,Awesome Bass. Not the BEST but very close! This sits right behind my couch so I feel everything! Very easy to hook up also!
5,Guys here is life-hack if you hear annoying hum from lowering transformer of this sub: drench the core (plates) by 50-50 mix of epoxy glue and lacquer thinner. The hum will go away (almost) completely.
5,I tried connecting sub out to one of the L/R channels per instructions and did not get any sound.  I had to buy a y RCA cable to split single sub out to both L/R and it works great and sounds great even with volumn low.  Just get that depth missing from my infinity 8" front speakers.
4,Added this as a second sub to my polk home stereo. Not nearly as impressive as the psw125 it does a nice job for the small amount of money invested!
5,I had to replace an older sub-woofer for our living room and this was deeply discounted the weekend that the other one had stopped working. After using it for several weeks I am willing to agree that it is not as good for music as it is for movies but it still sounds very very good and for the $80 that I paid it sounds amazing. People who aspire to be audiophiles were never going to buy something this small or with a 50w amp so I am not sure why comments were made about musical performance. Most of the world listens to music encoded at 128kps from their phones so imagining that you work for Stereo Review is probably wasted time. I have a WalMart variety Samsung LED TV and a medium level Sony amp. I am very happy with how this unit sounds.
5,For a quarter of the price of premium subwoofers you can’t get better than this. From mellow to insane this does the job for my home stereo system.
4,Works just fine for the cost. One dinger for not having a convenient on/off button as opposed to auto sense that it has. I don't push it hard just use to warm my music content.  Not over and above to warrant five stars.
4,If you turn the volume up on this where you can really tell it's there it gets boomy while watching things with background music such as sportscenter.  Truth be told I have the bass volume set a little high due to gaming.Also with a $20 Subwoofer Cable it has the "hum" that people complain about.  The situation is this when my receiver is on standby and the sub has no signal it emits a low humming noise.  I have it on the "Auto" power setting and the hum shuts off within 10 minutes.This sub hits hard and if it had above half volume you can hear it outside my house.  IMO no one needs any more than this for TV-watching.
3,After 7 weeks:Good deep bass as long as you keep the volume around 55-60% max. Better for movies but JUST OKAY for music.This is an entry level sub that probably is top 3 at this price point. I use it as my second sub to even out the bass from my HTS 12. Used this way it really helps fill a 16x20 room with deep full bass.I keep the volume at a smidge over half and the crossover all the way up (recommended by Polk since there’s no LFE input). Works much better in this capacity.One more thing. Placement is key for this sub. If you’re looking at the woofer (facing) from your seating position in a larger room it won’t sound good at all. I’ve got mine facing a corner and it’s night and day. Just a heads up.Good luck!
4,Definitely helps the bass response on home theater - action movies really grab you with the better bass.  Only spot was next to right front main speaker in 5.2 surround system:  Onkyo TX-NR747 (which is also new) Samsung 46-inch smart LED two old Fisher bookshelf speakers JBL center and two small speakers from a bookshelf stereo player at back surround.  We use Direct-TV satellite feed which is high-def and a Samsung DVD player for movies.  Someday would like to upgrade front speakers with Polk quality.
5,I’ve been looking for a replacement for an older much larger sub-woofer. My older unit was far too large for my current system and space. This unit from Polk Audio was the perfect size and compliments my system. It is an attractive unit and provides more than enough strong clear bass. The compact size is another big plus. I’ve purchased Polk Audio products in the past and have been very pleased with them. This sub-woofer is no exception. I recommend this unit
5,This magnificent box of wow transformed my living room listening pleasure.. it's huge! Appearance is fine...easy to setup to soundbar. I'm using it with a 2.0 Vizio soundbar. Took the advice of a subwoofer geek and placed rca connector to left input and to sub out on soundbar and maxed the crossover and then adjusted the gain to 50% and the phase in the middle somewhere and my music took on a new life and movies are phenomenal...Polk has impressed me big time.. this is not just a subwoofer.. this box rocks for the wattage.. I'm floored...
5,Fantastic!  Really excellent quality sound for 1/4 the price.  I don't understand how Polk is able to produce this level of quality at such a low cost...or why...but I am very happy with my purchase.  The sound is crisp and full and has way more power than I will ever use (when testing the system I could make my neighbors roof shake.)  I keep the volume way (way way way) down and it fills out my system perfectly.  Given this success for my home I'm now looking for an equivalent unit for my car.
5,while testing my newly purchase item(sub woofer) I hit volume control. heard a thud saw my neighbor laying in freshly cut grass u gotta respect the bass on the polk keep on dancing film at 11
5,Honestly never been a fan of polk products. Just personal opinion  However added this sub at a great price to two of my surround systems in 2 different rooms. These subs provided tremendous difference that was apparent from minute one. I paid less than 100 dollars from amazon for these subs. You will not be disappointed .  Would fit most budgets and completely add excellent bass to any system. Buy them. You will love them. Worth 3 times the price.
3,Not bad but wasn’t impressed either.
5,I purchased this sub-woofer to round-out my home theatre that is in a converted bedroom with the closet removed. The sub-woofer sits between the two chairs and when the film has heavy bass it actually shakes the (heavy leather) chairs. I found that I had to cut back on the sound level just a little to make it comfortable to watch movies with.Great unit for the money!
5,It's well worth the money.  Just get the right cable to hook it up.
5,I bought one of these over a year ago for my computer setup to give my Bose desktop speakers some bass support.  It sounded so good I moved it into the living room and bought a yamaha sound bar that I paired it with as my TV audio setup (replacing an old Bose Lifestyle system).  I just purchased this second one as a replacement for my office.  For the price I am very satisfied and sitting here listening to it again felt inspired to recommend this product for anyone wanting some personal bass.
5,Deep penetrating bass…
5,For the price this is one awesome sub!!!!!  It'll rattle the house and annoy the neighbors !!!!
4,Used to replace my burned out sub woofer. It produces very powerful bass which can be adjusted with the volume control.  Made all the difference between having a weak sound system vs. a powerful one.
3,I thought I would like this subwoofer due to reviews. First thing I noticed was the low pass filter only goes to 80hz. I was expecting 50hz or less but somehow I missed that in the description. That makes a huge difference. Secondly you can not crank up the bass as it begins to distort and extreme amount of port noise. This may be good for music but for a home theater it's not good. I'm still contemplating return this one.s
5,For the price this sub rocks my house! Neighbors even asked "did you get a new sound system?" Nope just added this sub
5,Bass so nice I bought it twice!!! Immerse yourself in the absolute lowest of lows. Got one crossover set at 60hz and the other crossover set at 160hz. My house sits off grade so the bottoms vibrate the floor. SO glad I bought these powered subs. I would buy another one if they made a 5.3 receiver! Treat yourself YOLO!!!
5,Just got it today and I have no problems so far. It's really great. A lot bigger than I thought but I'm not complaining. The bass sounds great.
5,REPLACED A SONY THAT DIED AND THIS IS MUCH BETTER AND SMALLER. GREAT PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE.
4,You may need to try both to get it working but it will be obvious when it is.The sound is good--I can hear it throughout my house. I have it partnered with some Polk bookcase speakers and it complements them nicely. Definitely the best money I have spent on audio equipment in some time.
5,I felt this was a very nice 10” entry level sub. My only reason for returning was the fact that I decided to stick to a 12” sub as I previously had in my setup. I would recommend this to all thinking of setting up a home theater system.
4,Excellent add-onnow that zi see th4 guallity I wish I would have gone with the 12.
5,This is a great deal... Seriously. I looked at some used PSW at local pawn shops that were near this price and half the size. It sounds awesome. I had to turned it down when watching blueray it was shaking the whole house. Also we were putting up some Christmas lights around the living room and it was in the corner so i stood on it to reach the ceiling. It is very solid made btw i weigh 240 lbs...lol
5,Love the sound from subwoofer
5,What a great deal for some awesome low end sound that's clean. Very nice quality and finish. Best sub for the price by far.
4,Had never owned a powered subwoofer before and wanted something to complement my Polk S15 Signature series speakers. The subwoofer definitely enhances the low end. I use it primarily when listening to vinyl. Very solid construction nice appearance and flexible inputs as well as crossover and master volume controls make this unit a winner given the low price point !
5,I got one of these a couple years ago and loved it.  This one is for my son who is upgrading his pathetic little stereo unit.  For the money this is a great unit and an incredible bargain.  Don't downplay it just because it is inexpensive.  Polk on the entry level audiophile market for me gives you the best quality for the price.  You won't get anything of this quality for Bose or Klipsch without spending much more.
5,Works great with a Vizio 3.0 soundbar and is perfect for a small (bedroom) or average size living room. There's enough bass to knock pictures off the walls and it's a clean punchy bass. Great price great item just buy it and enjoy. BTW: There's an easy modification that consists of unscrewing the back and removing a steel piece around the port. This is a must so keep that in mind otherwise if you leave it on you're going to get that chuff or fart noise from the port which limits this sub to 50% volume. Once you remove it you can easily crank it up to 80%.
4,This sub may work better in a living room or some other enclosed area. However its not so impressive in my covered outdoor patio area especially at higher volume levels.
5,Wow for $90 I am impressed.  Setup was easy and I have a receiver from the 70s - some speaker wire and was up and running in under 10 minutes.  Turned the phase setting to 180 and sounds fantastic.  I listen to records chromecast audio and an old pioneer receiver with 2 bose bookshelf speakers.  I can't see how much better the $700 sonos equivalent sub could be plus $200+ for speakers and $350 for a bridge.  I'm very happy with this and would buy again if I needed another.
5,This is the second sub that I added. Already owned one and bought an additional one when I upgraded my theater.
5,Very good sound.  I had a Kilipsh 10"  this sounds just as good if not better.
5,I look for a while for something like this. I have it hooked to a sound board. It was perfect for bringing out the bass in my studio. The build quality is great and it can get very loud. Price won me over but I am happy with the product.
5,Fits beautifully in my Stereo line up. Enhance the sound of deep Bass sound. Very good product.
5,The media could not be loaded.
4,Polk is a consistant favorite for all my mid-level audio systems.  Bang for buck check.  Reliable check.  Not Bose...check!  Only docking it a star because it's the smallest one I've used and I know the bigger two are better but I don't need all that much warm creamy sound for the living room setup - just a bit of a punch thank you...
5,For the cost of this Polk sub you can not go wrong.  It fills my 24ft x 18ft room very nicely.
5,MUCH better and clearer than my 6 1/2" sub that came with my Yamaha surround system.  This has nice bass replication without too much distortion (it isn't too great below 40hz) at higher volumes.  It's really good for a medium or small living room/living area that sounds great for movies - and particularly for music.  I'm happy I bought it and I think it has EXCELLENT quality especially considering the low price.  However if I had more money I'd buy the Polk PSW505 because I understand that sub has excellent sub-40hz capability but make no mistake this 10" is really good for what you are buying.
3,If you don't play your music loud then this is a great deal.  Don't expect it to fill a medium large room but if you maybe listen to tunes on your computer or watch shows on your TV at moderate volumes this sub is a strong candidate.  I had brand new Klipsh sub that costed more than like 3 times as much at the same time.  And at low volumes you may not notice too much of a difference.  Phew.That said I returned the Polk and went with the Klipsh.  But man alive that Polk is great for a limited budget!
5,The Polk PSW10 is great for the price and really fills the emptiness that you might have without it. I expected more from it because all I ever worked with before was car subwoofers overpowered bass and high powered amps at high volume. This is not like that. It was made for home surround sound systems to make movies more dynamic. I still use it for music exclusively it is just tuned to the point right before distortion and sounds alright. What I have said so far is about high volume now let me tell you about it at a comfortable listening low volume. It is stunning at a casual volume. The bass is more pronounced and all the lower frequencies are clear. I have nothing bad to say this Polk subwoofer.
5,I have this plugged into the orange port (center/subwoofer channel) of my PC sound card using an RCA to 3.5mm adapter. This thing is HUGE and it gets LOUD. Don't underestimate it it's not anything like the "subwoofers" that come in typical $25-$50 pre-packaged soundsystems.I HIGHLY recommend the use of audio mixer software that can manipulate each individual channel. I usually have my center/sub channel at least 10% lower than all other channels with this sub.
5,Sounds great for what it is. I was worried about only having 50 watts rms but polk has done their research. This is used to compliment monoprice in wall speakers with a denon receiver in a 32x14.5 basment room the sub fills the lows without hesitation. I'm sure a more expensive sub sounds better or louder but for the price I can purchase 2 of these. With some tuning to dial it in its awsome.
5,sounds better than old one--makes theater system pound
5,Pros - Made from real wood and very big and heavy. I thought it would be a lot quieter but at a quarter volume it still rattles stuff on my desk I'm using it for my PC setup and not a living room but it's exactly what I wanted. very nice for the price and very high quality.Cons - Absolutely none so far I will update if I have any problems but so far I'd definitely recommend it.
1,My Polk subwoofer is broken again a second time. I touched it to turn it on and there was a static spark from static electricity and it burned the whole thing out I tried replacing the fuse and that didn’t help so I contacted the POLK manufacturer because it’s still under warranty and they said I have to ship the entire subwoofer to an independent repair store in Los Angeles but they don’t pay for shipping and UPS charges $70.00 to ship it. It is 27 lbs. I also need to pay for the shipping to have it sent back to me. So they will repair it under warranty but the shipping costs are too expensive.  This is the second time in one year that it needed repairs.
4,I purchased 2 of these subs for my theatre room.I'm using one with my center channel and the other on my LFE.I'm running 5 powered sub woofers in my theatre room.1 = 8" Monoprice sub = main right channel speaker1 = 8" Monoprice sub = main left channel speaker1 = 10" Polk Audio sub = center channel speaker1 = 10" Polk Audio sub = LFE1 = 12" ENERGY sub = LFEI highly recommend running a powered sub with your center channel.....great sound!This sub is not as good as my ENERGY but is a great subwoofer for the price.This is a great sub for the price.
5,Easy to set up  Easy to adjust settings and sound quialty is Great !  Luv it
3,Disappointed. Polk should be ashamed to brand this sub with their name. The low end is significantly weak in comparison to my BIC F1 subs.  I guess I should have lower expectations for this price point. Will suffice in my garage. LOL
5,Made my $999.00 Denon AV Receiver sound like a $999 Receiver should !  Adds a huge "Sonic" sound to Everything and Brings out Bass you never knew was there!  It is what I was missing ! Glad I didn't spend more this does the job for me!
5,Forgot what being able to feel my music felt like until this guy came into my life. Exceeded my expectations.
4,For a hundred bucks it's a great deal and good performer.  However the low end (below about 45 hz) is a bit weak.  I have a couple of these but for my nice home theater setup I upgraded to a JBL ES250PBK which has plenty of low end thump (but for 3x the price!)  You can't beat it for the price and it will serve you well if this is your first subwoofer or secondary setup.The cabinet is attractive and it has all the features you need including auto power phase reverse adjustable crossover and adjustable volume.  Some subs on the market still don't have auto power off and draw power when you're not even using it!
4,For a 50-watt sub I'm really impressed... reasonably priced sounds good & pumps out an impressive amount of low end... I've run my system at quite high levels every now n' then & this unit handles it very nicely - the sheer volume of air (& low freqs) coming out of the front port is impressive... I probably could've gone w/ a 100-watt sub (for substantially more $$) but I'm not disappointed at all w/ this one... I run this unit w/ a Yamaha 5.1 surround receiver w/ the provided line level out & all works well..
4,Overall I have found this sub woofer great for the price. Some comments/reviews mention a "slapping" which I have experienced. But remember this is a low end speaker (price wise) so don't expect movie theater quality. For the price it is a great speaker. After I tweaked the settings on my receiver and the sub woofer itself I diminished the "slapping" noise to little to no "slapping." Like most low end speakers you just can't max out the volume and bass it will not necessarily give you better quality sound.
4,For the price I'd give it five stars. Some would say this sounds like a $200 sub (and I somewhat agree) but I could find a better sub for $200. Plays pretty low (deep) but seems to have too much port noise. I may disassemble it and install large rounded corners and remove the "+" bracket on the inside of the port (much like what is seen on the front face). I assume this'll diminish the port noise.
5,Its a great sub but i have it tuned down to the lowest setting to not disrupt the house. might be a bit of over kill for some but I still do not regret the purchase. if you need ear busting bass this thing only needs to be at 50-60 percent. great quality good clarity nice build and good features. overall very happy but I do wish i had gotten something a bit less powerful.
5,These subs are amazing I just added a second one and it sounds amazing
4,If you are an every day user looking to add bass to your home audio at an affordable price buy this.  It works great and will give you more bass than you ever need.  If you are an audiophile with discriminating ears have a movie room and have money to burn there are other subs with marginally better features and/or performance to be had.  This sub is fantastic and a steal at black friday prices!
4,HOME THEATER rooms up to 450 sq. feet (40 some sq meters) does the job.awsome buy. I have a 400 watt active infinity 15 inch sub... the good stuff... you know 3 figures... had a velodyne that a storm claimed... I got this for a "basic" home theater I setup in my basement... a 5.1... mated to a cheap denon avr e-200 and energy take classic speaker set... if you want deep bass with power (not the earth shattering) ample enough for you to get the volume down on action scenes it's perfect.PROPER SPEKAER MATCHING SETUP ACOUSTIC PREPARATION ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT thing... waaaaaay more then what you spend.
5,I needed a new subwoofer for a new setup in another room. I have an JBL 12" that was in my existing home theater setup but I decided to move that to the new room and replace it with this Polk (most of the other speakers in the home theater are polk).  Anyways at first I didn't think it would do as well as the 12" it replaced but it has surprisingly intense and clear bass. I'm very happy with this. Great with movies and very good with music.
5,I have the complete matching home theater speaker set up and this subwoofer compliments them perfectly. The lows are so clear and it doesn't rattle or thump against the cabinet. I use the speaker wire pass through and set it at about a 67 HZ crossover and it just rumbles the whole room.
4,Awesome stuff for the price it cant be beat. Saying that though it only likes up to about 60% volume at max. Gets away from itself after that. If you want loud music go bigger but for a decent jam watching a movie or playing games at a cheap price go for it.
5,This subwoofer was perfect for my small space. I like tighter bass and really like the sound. Ive read that to compensate for not having LFE you should turn the low pass filter to max. I backed this off a bit and sounds great. It is plenty loud enough for a 15x20 room and will rattle everything in the room when turned up. Amazing deal for under $90. Of course there are better subs out there for 3 times the price but this gets 5 stars for the price.
5,I just received and installed this product so i can say alot about it yet other than i can't really tell a huge difference in the sound quality of this product vs.  the Polk Audio 12" subwoofer that i replaced.  That being said paying $89 for this subwoofer to replace my old one that would cost $350 to replace means i feel like i made a great purchase so far.  I'm not an expert sound guy so all i wanted was to get my boom boom back for action flicks with guns and explosions and this product does the trick for me so far.  I also purchased a 2 year warranty for less than $8 so i feel pretty secure in the value of this purchase.
5,For the price this is a great unit. I'm pretty particular about my audio systems and I listen to all kinds of music from jazz to hard rock. This unit hits the lows cleanly and is powerful. Like most subs you may need to move it around the room to find the best all around sound but once I found the spot it's perfect. Would definitely consider buying another if I ever needed it!
4,Easy set up sounds good iam happy
5,I purchased this product after having a complete fail from a Monoprice subwoofer. I needed an entry level sub as I was on a tight budget. Originally purchasing the monoprice sub I should have known what i was getting into for the money. This sub out lived its reviews and reputation. While I have never had a super expensive high end unit this one  certainly made me feel like I just bought one.  Word of advise take the time to adjust your receiver channel and cross channel correctly. It took some tinkering but I was able to get great results even with out using a meter.
5,Really hard to beat at this price. Versatile inputs and quality materials make it built to last!
4,As noted by other reviewers this sub does has speaker level inputs as well as RCA inputs. The confusing thing is whether that RCA is equivalent of a subwoofer preout (which most receivers have). I connected the subwoofer preout from my receiver to ONE input of the subwoofer (you don't need to connect to both right and left one will do) and it worked just fine.Now to the best part I was watching a show on TV and it came to a part where there was a huge thunderstorm. My wife runs downstairs and yells at me what the hell are you watching??!! The house is shaking like their's an earthquake!!I don't think I need to say more.
5,Got this on sale for $89.99 on Amazon during Black Friday. One cord hook up from my Sony receiver sub out connection. The bass sound is very good. If I turn the volume on the sub all the way up the room really vibrates. For what I needed it works very well.
4,Great value subwoofer. Hooked it up to a Vizio SB 2820 soundbar to enhance the bass in a small weight room in my house. Exactly what I expected. Sounds great.
5,I have looked online at a lot of subwoofers. My "Man Cave" is 18.5' by 15'. This Polk Audio PSW10 10" sub is perfect for this room. I do not have expensive audio analysis equipment to measure the quality of my audio equipment. I have my 2 ears and this Polk Audio PSW10 sub along with my Denon AVR-1910 and my 7.1 Klipsch Synergy Quintet III surround sound speakers sound real good. The sub will rattle the windows in the adjacent room. I have read a lot of reviews about surround sound speaker systems that sound good with movies but not so good with music from CDs or other audio sources. This sub and my other speakers sound great with audio as well as movies. If you are looking for a good sub to use in a "Man Cave" simular to mine I highly recommend the Polk Audio PSW10.
5,I am incredibly impressed with the PSW10. After a few hours tweaking knobs on both the subwoofer and the receiver I have reached close to perfection. Despite the large physical size the PSW10 seems to have disappeared! Instead the entire room is filled beautifully with low frequencies melding perfectly with my surround sound speakers. I am no longer staring at the subwoofer when something is exploding on-screen distracted by a distorted booming sound.Ignore the reviews stating that this sub is boomy and unable to accurately hit the lows. This is not the PSW10's fault. Cranking the volume knob on the PSW10 is not the way to achieve more bass or lower frequencies! Plan on spending some time to get the PSW10 just right. Listen to a wide variety of music and movies. The PSW10 will sing in perfect harmony with your set-up when tuned correctly. You will hear new lows in music you have listened to for years. You will feel the explosions in your body on your favorite action films. For around $100 this subwoofer is an absolute steal.
5,This unit sounds great. I kick myself in the (well you know what) for not buying at least one more while they were on sale for under $100 each. I mean they will shake your room. I already have an 8" Polk sub woofer in my living room and with that and this new 10" they shake the room. We were watching an earthquake movie the other night (well at least I was. The little woman fell asleep. But when the earthquake hit in the movie it shook and rolled my other half right off the love seat. She really got the FEEL of surround sound that night.
5,Bought one for the bedroom and was so impressed  I bought another for the family room. I don't listen to Hip -Hop  I like bass thats a little tighter and this does the job. My only complaint is that Amazon recommends  an RCA to RCA cable. The PSW10 actually asks for a RCA Y cable . The PSW12 will take an RCA to RCA . Very good sub for the average audiophile unless you need to tell everyone you own a $700 sub. No idea why they are being priced so low. A real deal.
4,Was considering several subs read all the reviews went with this Polk very glad I did for the money hard to beat. Good response plenty of volume and the auto on feature makes it perfect for home theater.
3,It doesn’t hit low lows. I bought a klipsch instead which is infinitely better. This Polk one is actually louder but it was so rattly. If you want a less low louder grungier bass you might like this it’s not bad for the money.
5,I bought this along with some Pioneer bookshelf speakers for a home sound system. It was extremely easy to set up: Out of the receiver straight into the sub-woofer then out of the sub-woofer straight into the bookshelf speakers. When the sub-woofer is off the receiver just uses the bookshelf speakers. When the sub-woofer is on they all work together. It's that simple. Easy set up seems like good quality. Would purchase again.
5,This isn't part of my home theater it's in the coat closet next to my kitchen. Hey I like to listen to music when I cook!  As others have said it has a steep break-in curve. With sporadic use it took a while but I've found myself turning it down a little at a time. Works great for my totally overkill application!  Not giving up my Definitive Supercube in the theater room though ;)
5,This works wonderfully well with my fairly new Yamaha receiver on all sound sources.  We have five excellent speakers (two ceiling mounted surround) that we purchased 11 years ago with a Marantz receiver but the subwoofer died and the receiver started having connect problems as more components became HDMI connections and bluetooth was born!  The room is an open floor plan roughly 27x35ft with hardwood floors and 10ft ceilings.  Whether watching action movies or listening to rock jazz or classic music via streaming CD or broadcast I am very satisfied with this subwoofer.
5,I replaced my Polk 8" with this. Kind of feel I need to buy another to "officially" replace the 8" since I moved the smaller Polk to my home office. Dang you Polk!!!
5,I had two B&W bookshelf speakers for my computer a Mac with an LG 55in OLED TV as monitor.I got TWO of these Polk PSW10 which I mounted in parallel to the small speakers as bass woofers rather than subwoofers. Not to the subwoofer output that's important.They work amazingly well that way. It really sounds like a $5k system for a few hundreds...
4,AC Hum can be heard when close to the subwoofer so AC power filtering is not that good.
5,I'm giving this sub five stars for what it is: an inexpensive entry-level sub.  Frankly it competes well with any 10" sub below the $300 mark.  It sounds better with music than movies but then it is still going to sound better with movies than any other sub I can think of at even twice the price and certainly better than no sub at all.It is the best value on the market. Period.Just a note to those who may be interested: you can't bypass the crossover.  But then if that concerns you you are probably looking for something much more expensive anyway.
5,This is a great sub for the price i would highly recommend it to anyone on a budget or a beginner looking to build their first audio setup
5,Yep.  The positive reviews were correct.  This sub sounds amazing.  It makes Jurassic Park rumble big time.  Tried it with some music too.  Phenominal! Very good quality construction as well.  All I can say is get one.  You won't be disappointed.
5,I used this on my PC for more bass. It is much louder than expected. My motherboard allows me to hook up a sub using a 3.5mm. Sounds great.
5,I was looking for a subwoofer to supplement the studio monitors i have in my home studio. I only wanted a little more punch and did not want to spend too much money. This speaker is more than i could have ever wanted. It looks great sounds great and can handle anything i throw at it.The fact that its an active speaker is great because it does not require an amplifier. The outputs are very straight forward and easy to hookup. Also the speaker has a built in crossover so you can cut off the mids of a sound and only have the subwoofer pick up the lows if desired.Overall amazing speaker and for the price range you really cannot go wrong.
5,I have never had a home theater sub.  despite not being a home audiophile I have been into car audio for 25 years.I pondered this 10 inch sub for a long time and was almost afraid to buy it because it's so cheap but I finally pulled the trigger.this thing is awesome sounds great.  easy to hook up and adjust and sounds like a 12 inch.  I would buy again.
5,I'm really happy with this sub using it on my surround system and the bass its massive I have to keep the input on medium. Plenty of bass for my purpose extremely happy.
5,It’s a decent sized woofer for my space but it’s sturdy sounds great at a great price range! Well worth it.
5,This small sub will blow you away. I was expected a slight oomph to my sound but this thing can really shake a room. Great bang for your buck!
5,The price is unbelievable. The sound is fantastic. The warranty from Polk itself is 3-5 years on the speaker/parts. It says 100 watts max  50 RMS but this rattled my pictures on the walls when it’s down low. My room is An open 18x24 space and this sub more than fills the space. I honestly couldn’t imagine needing more than this sub provides. Highly recommmend the PSW 10. For the price it cannot be beat.
5,I’ve purchased 2 of these and they shake my house during a movie excellent!
5,Bought this to replace a 6 1/2” that came with my Yamaha receiver.  What a difference.  One small note if you have laminate or hardwood or any other slick surface buy some silicone bumpers.  It kept dancing around.  Also will have to do something about the grill. It keeps vibrating off tooSide note a bit disappointed that the day I received it it went down in price 10 bucks
5,I use this with a bluetooth powered bookshelf setup. The sub is working but only just barely. It's very underpowered. I would not recommend to anyone unless they are looking for overpriced paper weight.This subwoofer is only good for someone who lives in a house filled with pressure sensitive explosives.
5,This subwoofer is amazing. Easy to use. Easy to adjust. The sound that it adds to your sound system is incredible. Absolutely love it.
5,I've had this in my home theater for about a year now and really enjoy the sound it offers. For a ten inch subwoofer it can really deliver booming bass to the point that I need to adjust it down for certain content like Blu Rays. It really performs well with streaming audio internet radio audio CDs and vinyl. A great subwoofer for the price. Some people have criticized the low wattage of the built-in amplifier but I  have found this to be a highly efficient unit which sounds really nice. It compliments my surround sound very nicely and works well across our 25 foot living room.
5,I bough this as an addition to my surround sound system. My sub got fried in an electrical storm so I needed a replacement. I was a little hesitant about buying a 10'' since I previously had a 12'' sub beforehand. But this Polk made up for it in spades! I don't even have it turned up halfway and it sounds amazing. Movies and music sound so much better now. The bass is tighter and more responsive. Much less boomy and overpowering than before. I am thoroughly pleased with this subwoofer and I will look for more polk products In the future.
5,My original subwoofer died and the remaining surround sound speakers by themselves sounded so bad that I switched to listening to the TV's built-in speakers. When I plugged in this Polk subwoofer my reaction was "Holy Crap!!"  This speaker brought my system to life and filled the room with a powerful rich sound. This Polk is so much better than the original subwoofer from Cambridge Soundworks that I bought years ago.
4,This subwoofer performs very well! There are knobs on the back to control bass volume and also choose which frequencies you want played through the subwoofer. The bass quality is good but it is hard to find the perfect combination of volume and low-pass.
5,I have a 5.1 Bose system.  The Bose subwoofer is weak.  I added this Polk 10" powered subwoofer and it's like having a new sound system!
4,Can't go wrong with this product. Since getting it movies and TV sound alot better. I can't comment on music yet since I haven't played a CD/radio but movies and TV sounds much better now with that bass. It won't BLOW you away with bass but it gives a nice warm and deep bass that will enhance your theater sound as soon as its hooked up. And its very appealing to the eyes. Makes my audio setup look very professional now. Another great Polk Audio product. If you have a really large room or want to FEEL the bass you might want to upgrade to a 12" subwoofer or get the more expensive model that handles more watts.
4,A very great sounding sub for an amazing price. Currently using it with JBL surround speakers and it sounds great!Had to remove the speaker grille becuase it would cause some unwanted vibration. Although it can't handle the lower frequencies consistently it's perfect for watching moves and playing games. It's decent to play music on but I wish it would handle bass frequencies better.That being said it is still a great value for what you get. The folks at polk know what they're doing.
5,I great power sub especially for the money. I have a 7.2 surround sound receiver and both another one. Just read the manual for the sub to set it up for your receiver
5,Overall EXTREMELY pleased! This thing performs more like a $300 sub given the power and volume it puts out. Very smooth and clean bass. I wish the bass was a little tighter at times and you can hear the air slapping a bit out of the port when the volume is crank way up. Great budget sub for and entry level home theater.
5,You will not find a better sub for a home theater setup at this price period.  This $100 is good for both music and movies. as it delivers both tight punchy bass and deep low bass.  Performance-wise the only reason to pay more for another 10inch sub would be to get the same performance but in a smaller footprint.Again you will not find a better sub at this price point.  Can't say enough good things about this sub.
3,I am disappointed as I always considered Polk Audio as being amongst the best in the audio world.  This sub looks nice and is well made.  However the bass is a tad boomy and not sounding like true bass.  Also no remote to control the bass and the adjustment nobs are located in the BACK of the sub.  So one is forced to place the sub so you can reach the adjustments.  And as such unless you have easy access to see the duel adjustment nob settings it all becomes a guess as to the true setting.  Different situations call for different adjustments of bass.  Lastly this thing is heavy … I mean HEAVY!!  I would be afraid driving a MAC truck into this thing!  A MAC truck might lose!
5,Great addition to our home theater system.
5,I was so stoked to get this product. Had to play ridiculously loud music for about a month after purchase just to show off to all of my friends. I have only had it for a few months. If there are any updates I need to add regarding my appreciation for the product I'll be sure and change my rating if warranted.
4,I originally got a Klipsch - Reference Series 10" 150W Powered Subwoofer but the price was too high to be worth what I wanted. These do the job for less than 1/2 the price :) Perfectly happy with them
5,Too good for the price! This sub sounds so good and makes my experience with my turntable x10000 better than with just the speakers.
5,Excellent value; sound is great and set-up was easy.  would highly recommend.
2,Worked great for a few months. Then it stopped working out of nowhere. It only made a loud humming even when disconnected from all input/output cables. Only the power cord was plugged in.I called customer service who told me to disassemble the unit and mail them the internal amplifier which is attached to the pack control panel. I unscrewed the back panel but it was wired to the front cone and I wasn't sure how to disconnect the wire so I called again and they explained how to disconnect the wire.Overall customer service was able to tell me what to do but was a bit gruff. I felt like I was talking to a trucker.I mailed the amplifier unit and a week later a new one came in the mail. They included a letter saying the first one was a courtesy replacement and that future repairs would require proof of purchase. I had included a print-out of the Amazon receipt that was emailed to me so I'm not sure what else I should have sent.As for the sound quality this is the only subwoofer I have ever owned so I don't have a frame of reference. If I aim it at my glass sliding doors I can make them rattle. It's plenty loud for my 1-bedroom apartment. When I stand in the hallway of my apartment I can feel the bass in the whole hallway. I have no doubt that when I turn it up my neighbors can hear/feel it.Though I haven't tried any other subwoofers I wish there was more clarity and lower rumbles. Often it just sounds like loud muffled noise and the sounds bleed together too much.
3,I bought this as a replacement for a 12 inch Klipsch which I thought had died.  After getting it the sound from the Polk simply could not compare to that Klipsch but it was fine for what it is and the price.I decided to see if I can fix the Klipsh but found no problems with the power supplies and internal amp from visual inspection turned out I had a loose cable inside the Klipsch and that's why it stopped working.  I've relegated this Polk to life inside it's box for the time being.  I've not entertained trying to run both subs as the Klipsch completely overwhelms my house and at mid levels is liable to tear my kitchen furniture apart.I'm giving this only 3 stars but I suspect many people will be happy with the purchase.
5,This little affordable fella really packs a punch!  Amazing that a name brand sub like this can be had for such a great price.  My JBL 12" Sub just suddenly died.  I was going to try to find somewhere to get it fixed but sheesh I couldn't find anyone to look at it for less than the price of this one brand new.  That said my 12" JBL wassss a little better but...  For this price?  Brand new?  You just can't go wrong.
4,Added this sub to my Bose SoundTouch setup.  Does the job plenty of bass...
5,Impressive for sure. My monitors sound full.
5,Absolutely amazing value!Clean punchy and LOUD! You can't go wrong for this price.
1,While the initial performance of this sub is decent for the price range the quality control is terrible.  Given the positive reviews and decent initial performance for the price I've given this sub a chance a few times.  However the amp always seems to fail within a year or two.  At this point I wish I would have just bought something nicer originally and saved myself the hassle of trying this same sub 3 times thinking that I was unlucky and just got a dud.  At this point it's pretty clear that the quality control on these things is just poor and they aren't built to last.  Although all of mine failed within the warranty period Polk's warranty terms are terrible.  You have to pay to ship the sub to them to fix.  These subs are heavy so shipping is insanely expensive (which explains why I kept just buying new ones instead of spending almost as much on shipping and having to go without a sub for weeks at a time).  Had I known I would have just spent 3 times as much on something nicer originally and not wasted my time and money on this model.For reference I have a wife and young children (who are often sleeping when I watch movies at night) so I do not blast movies or music at all.  I probably don't even use 25% of this thing's advertised capability so it isn't as if I'm blasting the thing all the time and causing problems by overloading its capabilities.
5,easy to adjust volume levels and crossover frequency plenty of bass for 15 by 15 room
5,It's a really good speaker
5,Finally I have bottom in the audio and properly filled music. I don't like bass so excessive that it drives me to the aspirin bottle and this unit fills the lows without any aural discomfort.  I have been pleasantly surprised a number of times wondering what the "rumble" is (train thunder semi truck?) and by the slight vibration in the kitchen counter caused by the lows in the soundtrack. I am glad about this purchase.
5,I bought this sub to go with a pair of elac b6's to go in a 20'×14' room.  It absolutely blows away the passive subs Im used to that come with mid-range surround sound systems delivering a tighter more nuanced sound as well as being much more powerful.
5,Very easy to set up. Very clean sound.
4,I'm partial to Polk speakers and find this sub to perform better than I expected for the price I paid ($98 on sale).  While this sub doesn't perform as well as my 12 year old PSW350 (it shouldn't since it has 300 watts less power) it still sounds great. I agree with other reviews that stated that it sounds better for music than it does for home theater use... but still does a good job of filling out the sound during a move/TV show. Also don't worry about it not having an LFE input... just max out the frequency on the back of the sub to allow your receiver to override the sub's settings and use it's own.
4,This thing sounds effin AWESOME. I paired it with some powered bookshelf speakers and an Audio Technica turntable and my records sound amazing. It doesn't get a five star because it can get boomy at higher frequencies but other than that I recommend this thing all day long. I keep the volume at about halfway and it goes nice and low on everything from Slayer to Bach cantatas and the price was fantastic.
5,So tunable exactly what I needed
5,The sound on this subwoofer is amazing. This was a great purchase!
5,When an old AudioSource SW8 gave up the ghost after 17 years of service I needed a replacement for my small (240 s.f.) home theatre.  The PSW10 has been a terrific solution (for about half of what I paid for the SW8 in 1996!)  Used variously for music movies and--primarily by my 16-year-old son--PS3 gaming the PSW10 complements the rest of the room's speakers (KLH 900Bs front L-R DCM KX-Center HTX in-wall rear L-R) and has sounded great regardless of volume level or source material.  And although it's pictured with speaker and port exposed the PSW10 comes with a black fabric grille which arches away slightly from the cabinet which leaves the edge of the silver face exposed and looks quite nice.  Highly recommended.
5,Perfect for my TV sound system.  I don't need earthquake levels of bass just enough so that I know it is there.  These do the job.
3,If you are a true audiophile this one won't do it for you. However when it's connected to your television the bass quality is likely far better than the output of the speakers that come with your television. And if connected to a good amp and you have a relatively small room the bass will rattle the windows!
5,When my old subwoofer called it quits I decided to go with Polk as the rest of my home theater system had been replaced with Polk. This lived up to the promise of the rest of the system. Excellent sound quality deep bass in the room almost too much as I have to keep it set low or it vibrates the whole house. Glad I didn't get the 12" one.
5,Very happy with this sub.  Can’t beat the price.  Only issue I had was with setup to my receiver as this model takes just a standard audio cable red/white from woofer and my receiver has just one woofer input so I needed a y splitter.  They also sell audio cables that have the splitter built in.  Minor issue but it doesn’t take the standard subwoofer cable that many stores sell.
5,This subwoofer worked great right out of the box.  Easy to install easy to set up controls are on the back but can easily be reached with the unit against a wall.  Sound is fabulous with our Vizio sound bar.  Highly recommended.
4,Not bad. I put this on my home studio monitors to pickup the kick drum a bit better. Works well for the money and the sound isnt bad either.
5,I read the reviews decided it sounded like a good purchase I ordered it to replace a much higher cost sub woofer that I've had for years that was failing it kept cutting in and out.  For $99 I have to say it's awesome I'm pleased.
5,This will get your heart happy again real music 🎶 coming through!
5,After a lot of research particularly reading most of the reviews on Amazon we chose the PSW10 and could not be happier.  We have recently upgraded our home theater to include this Sub-woofer a Yamaha RX-675 receiver 4 Onkyo towers and a Yamaha center speaker. This sub-woofer paired with the Yamaha receiver gives us better deep-base sound than we have ever heard from any of our previous stereo systems.If you are in the market for an excellent Sub-woofer consider the PSW10.  It brings a whole new dimension to both hi-def movies and music.
5,My old sub finally went out after 5 years of light use. I researched that one for weeks. This time I relied on Amazon's reviews and quickly selected this one as the best bang for my buck.I have it behind my TV stand in the corner of a room. It connects to the receiver using two sub (RCA style) cables. I set the power and gain dials to midway and flipped it on to auto power mode. I was impressed with it bass. I noticed it also has several inputs for speaker wire if you don't have sub out ports.It was a little bigger than I envisioned but I think my other sub must have been a 8".
5,I am picky about the sound that comes from my TV and when we put a flat screen above our fireplace it did not produce enough bass on its own.  I looked through sound bars but have never had luck with wireless speakers so I went with this to keep it low profile and hide it in the corner to keep our "sitting room" looking nice.  This has a wide range of levels so you can go from almost blowing the doors off to just noticing it is there.  The only slightly annoying thing is the auto on/off is a bit finicky and it will cut in and out if you have the output at low volumes.  luckily at low volumes I usually don't want that much bass anyway.
5,The sound is so darn awesome. We have it hooked to a Sony 4k audio receiver which enhances the sound. I like that I can fine tune the subwoofer via the receiver and the subwoofer itself for exceptional quality. Keep in mind that you don't need a really high volume to feel the vibrations. We tested it with the movie Skyfall & wow great!  Make sure you buy high quality subwoofer cables.We love it during movie time and listening to music.
5,I'm no audiophile but this delivered way more than I was expecting (both for the size and cost); even on a relatively low power it will literally and figuratively shake your house. Some 20 years ago we used to get the same effect by mounting twin 12" subs in the back of a mates car and playing tracks like 'urban shakedown'. I'd go as far as saying that this single 10" ported unit exceeds that experience and will make the hairs on the back of your neck bristle with the right track. Extremely impressed!
5,If you want that theater experience that rattles the house on certain scenes then this is it!!!!
3,Hello I will keep this short. I have had this sub about 4 months and for the price it is not bad at all. It really depends on what you are using it for. I have a 2000 watt stereo system I have it in. Right now it is running with another self powered 10" sub (an old RCA model that is about 10 years old) I will say that this sub gets lost a little even compared to the older RCA my RCA definitely out performs it and they are in the same class (both around 100 watts or so).This sub puts out clean bass but can't handle a whole lot if you are trying to really jam out with music to me it would be better suited for a computer sound system or just for movies/tv or if you just like listening to music at a medium level.My overall opinion/recommendation: good sub for the price but I would pay a little extra and go after something with a little more punch... even here on amazon you can get something like a BIC F12 (that has about 5 times the power) for only about $80 more dollars.
4,This thing packs a serious punch and at $100 it's probably your best bet on getting the most out of your money
5,I bought 2 of these bad boys and it makes a huge difference while watching movies. Only being able to watch movies at home right now this is as close to theater quality as you can get
5,Best subwoofer I have bass sounds awesome it makes my doors and windows shake! would definitely buy it again.
5,This little box rocks! Plenty of power and lots of bass!
4,Obviously not audiophile quality but for its price this is a nice subwoofer. A friend recommended that I try a subwoofer before getting new speakers. I'm glad I listened. I feel like a have a new system. With the subwoofer handling the lowest frequencies my speakers do a better job of reproducing the rest of the sonic spectrum. The total experience is very satisfying.
5,Nice little Subwoofer. Made up a  bedroom/man cave and paired this with a Pioneer Receiver and a pair of Yamaha book shelf speakers and this thing has some punch and rocks. My bathroom which is the next room resonates with this thing going. Love it. The space it is in is only 12' x 12' so I know it would work in a much larger area no problem. Polk did a good job with this. Nice and compact and works and sounds so good.Very happy with this purchase.
5,It arrived within 1 day per use with Amazon though. The volume knob is a bit finicky to get to what you want but that is standard for most subs anyway. It sounds great and there is no better deal that I have found.
5,Replaced old Sony sub in home theater system that was broken in move.  I have the Polk in my main system where it works fine. No changes to model so I bought another for theater system.  It was $25 off. It works fine.
4,Nice looking sub! Keep in mind that this is a large enclosure. It totally adds a new dimension to the sound of my 7.1 setup. Cheap plastic feet broke scooting it across a tile floor easily replaced with rubber with a trip to the hardware store. Would buy again!
4,Not loud enough for a large room but great for a small living room or large bedroom. Feels like high quality construction but turned all the way up the bass causes the front cover to come loose. You definitely get more than you pay for. Not going to complain about the price.
5,Upgraded my old Panasonic all-in-one home theater/DVD player to a Yamaha TSR-7850 receiver.I was able to reuse the old 6K speakers but the Panasonic had a passive subwoofer and the Yamaha needed an active one. I wasn't looking to spend a lot so this Polk was already $50 more than I was hoping for but the sound is amazing!Well worth the investment and glad I did.
5,I bought this for a small computer room and it really kicks.  Very high power and owning it for 1.5 years now I have pushed this subwoofer alot harder than most people would.  I listen to dubstep and other heavy bass driven electronic music I run movies through it and it rumbles.Great subwoofer.3 Years in and 4 dead amps later proves that this sub-woofer AND AMP are quality and I blast DUBSTEP for 10 hours at a time stupid vodka...  This powered sub-woofer will sustain the harshest punishment and low cost at the same time.UPDATE:  First subwoofer is still running strong decided to add another one to my system.  Deserves 10 stars!
5,I have been pleased with this subwoofer and it was a solid addition to my 5.1 stereo system (I didn’t have a subwoofer for the system before).  The price was great and the quality is very good.  Now that my stereo receiver is sending a lot of the bass to the subwoofer (instead of the speakers) I swear that I hear sounds coming from the speakers that I couldn’t quite hear before.  It’s also a lot of fun for watching movies.  If you watch a movie like Jurassic World the subwoofer adds a lot of depth to the experience.
5,If you need a subwoofer for a receiver this is a great buy for the price.  Connections are easy sound is great 'tuning' the bass adjustments in the back are straight forward.  Recommend it!
5,Finally got a house where I can crank it up!  Always wanted a subwoofer and this one fits perfectly fills my office with BASSSSSS!
5,Been waiting 30 years to hear that sound of a powered sub attached to the sound system I have been working on for years.  Didn’t disappoint at all.  ITS FLIPPIN AWESOME.
5,Excellent quality and sound for very little money.  There may be bigger and better subs out there but this should suit any home theater system unless you have an extremely large room and a very high-end system.  A great feature is that it automatically turns itself on and off or you can manually turn it on and off if needed.  Plenty of clean bass for movies and music.  Polk makes great products.  Pairs well with the new Polk Signature series similar driver.
5,This woofer is a must if you buy the Onkyo CS-445 CD system!  I use this woofer with said system in my tiny bedroom and it sounds wonderful.There are two main features I like about this woofer:  One it's very simple to hook up just one cable.  Two it has it's own volume control.  When I use this while the house is occupied I can turn the volume down to reduce the bass.  When I have the house to myself I can turn it up and shake the daylights out of my room!  I highly recommend this with the Onkyo system if you're going to put them in a small room.
5,I purchased this sub to fill out my computer's audio set up. I have a pair of Sony SS-B3000's which by themselves were wonderful but I wanted just a little more. Based on other reviews I decided I wanted this one over the Sony WA-2500 and I'm very happy with my purchase. I have never listened to the Sony sub though so this is not a comparison. Overall the sub is wonderful. It sits under my desk and once I had it set up I instantly fell in love. It handles anything under 100hz perfectly.Warning: Do not expect this sub to work well in a room larger than 25x20. I sit 5 feet away from it and it's still turned almost to 50% so I can only imagine having to sit more than 10 feet away from it would sound awful.
5,I am not much of an expert and bought this one on recommendations from others. I will say that it makes a huge difference. Music and movies took on a whole new quality. For the price and the improvement in sound it is a bargain!
4,Does come with a front cover which is important to me.  Does the job well at a fair price.  I'm impressed especially by how much better my other speakers sound now that this is handling the low sounds.  Dialogue in particular is clearer than any other home TV listening experience I've been around.Would have preferred it had a single input the non-standard 2-to-1 cord is a bit odd but not a headache once purchased and installed.
5,I love this subwoofer I bought 2 because they said 50 Watts but once I connected just one ohhhhh my God this subwoofer is the truth believe me I'm a real sound man from the old school and I'm thinking about buying another one for this price it's a steal I still can't believe how great they sound I can hear them from my parking lot the bass Is just ridiculous loud
4,My husband bought this.  He is very pleased.  Sound is awesome and I am surprised the neighbors don't complain about it.  We have it in our pool room outside so it is very nice listening to it on our patio by the pool.
5,Sounds great. Full bass and very active.
4,paid 99 bucks worth every cent. Use it for TV/movies. great sound.Gives extra boost to my sound system.maybe not as powerful as other woofers on the market but more than enough for my average sized living room .(Go 12 inch only if you have a huge living room)I think  it also has  great sound for music I know some audiophiles will argue with me but for 99 bucks its no discussion.
5,Good sound deep bass and for the price you can't beat it.  I have this with a pair of Polk bookshelf speakers running to a receiver connected to my computer.  The bass really shakes the walls in the house if it crank it up.  My only complaint is the the setting knobs are on the back of the speaker so it's kind of a pain to change settings on the fly.  I just have it set to where it sounds good with all genres but not 100% optimal for all.
4,I got this unit more for movies than for music but it has proved to be good for both. The wife doesn't so much like the boom-boom but I do especially when watching those guy movies we love so much. I'm still moving the woofer around to find the best position. This is my first woofer and I'm really please with it as well as the service at Amazon. I originally got a woofer that popped in about 10 minutes watching the end of Matrix 3 emailed them and they shipped another one out that day - no questions! The 2nd one has been rock'in for a month now! Buy this!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Good with music videogames and movies
4,added to enhance the bass with the sony sscs5 bookshelf speakers. does a very nice job simple to set up
5,I know next to nothing about home theater systems. I unplugged the broken subwoofer I've been looking at for the last three years and plugged this one in. Turned on a rock station and shook every window in my house. This thing is fantastic.If you're looking for a subwoofer stop reading stop looking and just go buy this one already. You can't go wrong.
4,I like the sound of this sub its really impressive due the cost of this unit. I would 100% recommend it
5,you won't regret this purchase at this tremendous price ...once i hooked this baby up to my surround sound Yamaha receiver this Sub puts out also larger than i expected low thunderous sounds could feel the vibrations on my couch and bounce off the living room walls my Sony sub that i previously had Does not come close to this one i am very happy for what i need it for Does a super job Thumbs up !
5,Excellent subwhoofer. The 10" speaker provides great bass even at low volumes which I find enjoyable. It has more punch and less booming than others I've had in the past. It is connecteded to a pair of Edifier R1850DB Bookshelf speakers and the system sounds wonderful together.
5,My old subwoofer went bad.  A tech who worked on my system recommended this Polk Audio subwoofer as a replacement.  He said it would offer performance equal to other units selling for four or five times as much.  He was right.
4,Was expecting slightly better sound (4 stars) from a "Polk" but for the 5 star sale price I really can't complain.  The box and connections are sturdy/well made and like that it has a "standby mode.".  You'll need to purchase a cable separately to link to your AV receiver or sound bar.
5,Enclosure looks well made and has a good weight to it.  Setup for my 5.1 system was plug and play.  Sounds great with no distortion or rattles.
5,Very powerful very crisp sounding across the whole spectrum of frequencies.IMPORTANTFor best sound connect only ONE of either the L or R side RCA connections on the back of the sub ( I repeat either one or the other not both). connect the opposite end of that RCA cord to the subwoofer input on your receiver. Next turn the Low Pass Filter (LPF) knob all the way up so that the filter passes the largest possible bandwidth. This effectively creates a HFE connection from your sub to the receiver.
4,This is a good unit and sounds really good. And the price make it that much better. I would have liked the cut-over frequency control knob to be a bit more sensitive. But this is easy enough to correct with a good EQ. I like the unit a lot but not sure my neighbors do.
5,First of all I'm no audiophile. However I know what sound good to me and what doesn't. The Polk PSW10 sounds fantastic. I've paired mine with the Polk Soundbar 50. The additional bass the PSW10 provides enhances all TV programming and movies. As far as music is concerned the PSW10 enables the soundbar to outshine my Klipsch KG4 speakers. I'm well beyond the need for earthquake bass. However you will feel the PSW10s in your chest when you volume up your music or movies. Set up was a cinch. I simply connected to my receivers front speakers as per the Soundbar manuals suggestion and plugged it in. Automatic on and off means I never need to think about it again. Having experienced the quality and ease of the PSW10s I would gladly pay double the $89.00 I paid at Amazon.
5,I am impressed by this subwoofer I have had this subwoofer for nine months now and have watched alot of movies and listened to alot of music with it and I like what I have bought.  I have got this subwoofer hooked up to a Sony STR-DH800 reciever by RCA Monster cable with a right and left splitter to connect to the subwoofer.  Since there is no LFE input I turned the low pass just about all the way up and have got the phase set to 0.  This makes enough bass to rattle things in the kitchen one room over not to mention the picuters on the wall. The auto-on is nice I have read that there is some lag time but I have not really noticed any. I am pleased with the Polk PSW10 subwoofer.
4,Great only if you get it on sale for $100. Bass distorts if you push it to much.
4,Excellent product for the money. Good clean low end for an unbeatable price. Woofer is solidly made easily hooked up to a standard receiver through an RCA pre-out. I have it about halfway for for a fairly good-sized great room. Sounds amazing through my surround sound with movies and music. Great buy!
5,Great price and quality bass used with my Denon surround sound.
5,It is very well built it works perfectly with an Onkyo receiver. I placed it directly in front of my sitting position and you can definitely feel it. Great test material: play the trailer for Top Gun Maverick it will shake your house.
4,Good sound quality rich bass and a nice upgrade to the default sub that came with my surround system.  The controls are easy and intuitive and connections to the system are simply two wires.  If you want an affordable upgrade to your home theater sound system this isn't a bad option.
4,I bought the PSW10 on Amazon for about $100 and I am blown away by the value.  I worked as a profesional home theater installer for about 5 years and sold many $400 subs that were no better than this.  The 50 watt power rating is very conservative.  Truth is it's just an honest rating on a quality amp.  I paired it with a run-of-the-mill Pioneer receiver and the Klipsch Quintet II speaker system. (also from Amazon $300)The end result for a $400 speaker system is amazing.  For music and movies at low to moderately high volume you could spend $2000 on a Bose system and not have sound this accurate and dynamic.  (My mother in law just did).
5,I have been subless for quite some time on my home theater system. I was relying on my Bose 301s to pick up the low range. They just aren't made for that. As soon as I connected this sub my home theater sound became far richer and clearer. The theater speakers (301s in front VCS 10 center channel acustimass 3 rear channels) were relieved of low sound duty and the sub filled the room with clean low tones. I just could not beat this sub for the money. Just be advised that you need a male-male Y RCA cable to properly connect the sub to your system.
5,This lil thing replaced an older one I had that cost me a lot of money. The thing really kicks bass and sounds good with my setup. Was pleasantly Surprised.
5,Such a great addition to my stereo system  with many extra features  add ones  speakers  on off switch  volume control etcAnd it has the boom and bass  I play Aerosmith sweet emotion thru it  it rocks
5,I'm not much of an audiophile but this sub really upgraded the overall sound of my basement home theater.  I upgraded to a Sony receiver and needed a powered sub since the theater in a box sub was non-powered.  This fits the bill perfectly and the price was great.  Easy set up and handles everything I could ever ask of it while sounding big and full.
5,It has loud booming bass is and if you sit near it you feel it in your chest. I love it! The price is unbeatable. I’ve been using it at half volume for a couple hours and it isn’t even warm. I highly recommend this sub!
4,So far pleased with the Polk Audio PSW10. It is working well as part of my 5.1 home theater system.Just be aware that they did not include LFE so set up and use are a bit more complicated I think they could have included this but they kept it as a step up feature on the 12" model to help justify a higher price.Bottom line for under $100 it was a good purchase. At over $100 I would probably have gone in a different direction.
5,Much much better than the sub that came with my Home Theater set up. Really feel the bass now. Easy to hook up and it's a little smaller than the one Ihad before. Total win-win.
5,Good
5,This is a great subwoofer replacing my Yamaha sub. Worth every penny that you paid for. This is a must buy to complete your home theater set up.
5,love it
5,Great quality so far.  Very easy to balance great sound great bass.
5,I'm new to sub woofers so here is a review based off of what I know:1. The product quality of both the sound and the material are great.2. The price is very fair.3. I recommend this sub woofer for any first time sub woofer buyers (This is my first sub woofer)4. And as a bonus it looks cool at heck.If you want a sub woofer that sounds good looks good and is fairly inexpensive I recommend it. I'm sure there are better sounding sub woofers out there but you will have to spend a lot more money. Get this thing it is great. I love it.
5,Works great nice add on for my sound bar. depending on your sound bar it it has a LR out or just a sub out you may need a Y splitter as this subwoofer only has LR connections. It performs well and puts out a lot of bass. now if you are looking for super loud this may not do it but for me for music and movies and general use it is perfect and has a lot of room to go up if your trying to blow your ear drums this wont do it.
3,The sub arrived with the box torn open.....I'm guessing that's where any kind of ppwk including instruction or operation manuals might be.  Since I'm a FNG in the world of subs I really needed those to get it to function properly.  The box looked like it had been run over with a forklift and frankly I'm surprised it did work at all.May I suggest if you have a desire for an inexpensively priced sub and would like a decent product at a good price this Polk might be the way to go.  Once I finally got it hooked up I was surprised at the bass it pumped.  Pushed the dog out of the room and almost yelling during the fight scenes in Pearl Harbor.
5,WOW! after a couple of hours of breaking in it keeps getting better. This is perfect for small to mid size rooms. You WILL NOT be disappointed in these. The price is right for $99. Keep in mind to hook it up from the pre out of your receiver to the left right AV jacks in the back of sub to adjust the setting from the sub itself. This added so much to my music experience.
5,I bought this to go along with a pair of powered Edifier bookshelf speakers on our living room TV. For the price you can't go wrong. This woofer delivers a powerful wide array of bass frequencies for it's size as well. It really woke the sound up in boomy movies and music.
5,This speaker brought so much more sound from our CDs--we are hearing bottom end we never new existed. Very well worth the reasonable investment
5,Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas after he blew his sub & he loves it!
5,Crossover control knob is very useful to tune your system. When paired with the Polk Audio TSi200's I found maxing out the crossover to 160Hz was about right perhaps a touch light at 150Hz or so is ideal.Volume control knob right on the base is handy as well.A good 10" driver sub around the price point of most 8" drivers. Solid buy.
5,This is a great subwoofer at a bargain price. I paired it with Edifier bookshelf speakers and a Creative Sound Blaster Z card as an upgrade to my PC sound system. This gives me studio quality sound (in my opinion) from my pc where I spend a lot of time. Polk also makes a 12" subwoofer that would be even more awesome if one has the money and the space under their desk.
5,Have had for a couple years now and made it through some moves.  Adds nice clear bottom to stereo setup I have with 2 8inch jbl bookshelf speakers from the 80s not the most buttery or mid happy woofer but enough adjustment options to dial in a good sound.  Unless you’re filling a HUGE room or a total bass head you’ll be happy with the price and quality.
5,Got this thing on sale and couldn’t be happier. This puts out some serious bass with a good receiver. Really takes my vinyls’ sound to the next level.
5,This replacement arrived on the same day very impressive. Know I know why it's rated so high and the most purchased. This subwoofer has excellent sound for the price and I agree that it can't be beat in value. I won't hesitate to recommend or purchase again if ever needed. Polk speakers have never let me down and have worked perfectly in my surround sound array.
5,Love Polk Audio equipment. Sounds great and longevity plus company is great with warrently if ever needed.
5,For the price this is a great subwoofer. Easy to hook up and sounds great.
5,Paired this sub with polk T15 bookshelves & Polk T30 center channel & Onkyo NR717.  I used mediabridge sub woofer cables including the mediabridge RCA Y-Cables.  Its in a small living room and it looks and sounds surprising well with my choice of speakers and AVR.  We don't have a movie theater in our home that requires ridiculously expensive sub woofers and huge speakers.  this is perfect for the living room area.  Can't comment about longevity.  time will tell but for the price can't really go wrong here.
4,This is a really large sub enclosure. I have owned less established brands that had a much more punchy sound. I would recommend getting something smaller and slightly higher quality. There is nothing really wrong with this sub but I expected to be blown away by its sound considering its size. As it is this is just a very average sub in a very large enclosure.
5,Polk Audio is by far the best speaker company for the money! They got building speakers down to a science and even though they are a huge quantity- volume seller they seem to know how to keep the quality up above standard. Sure there are better quality and even way better sounding speakers available but not at Polks price point not even close. Polk delivers a clean realistic rich sound with a quality build at realistic price that you don't have to be rich to afford. You can be proud to own Polk Audio.
5,I have to admit that I am sort of a Polk Audio fan. So I did not hesitate to buy this sub-woofer when I wanted to build my home theater system. A friend of mine actually bought this for his system and I got a chance to hear it before buying it. It would hit all the low end notes that were thrown its way.Pros:AffordableNice Frequency RangeSpeaker Hook-UpsNice Finish on both Black and Cherry VersionsAuto/on/off switchVolume and Frequency Cut Off dials.5 Year WarrantyCons:No LFEEntry LevelFinal Thoughts: The sub-woofer does need a break in period as does any speaker. This sub can really add that needed bass for any home system. Polk Audio quality is amazing and the warranty stands behind that statement.
5,I have this hooked up to my computer for gaming and music. Let me tell you that BF3 sounds like a revolution just started in my house. When playing music crap all the way into the kitchen will shake a little bit which to be honest is kinda scary. I have heard the vibrating shaking noise people complain about but ive since removed the cover and its disappeared. I have heard it once or twice since but it was for a quick second while an extremely low frequency played. I actually have it turned down its about at 35% volume any louder and it gives me a headache. For 89 bucks shipped Im very happy with this. It adds great bass to my two 6 by 9 pioneer speakers I have hooked up also. Id very much recommend this.
5,Great product for a small room works well for music and better for av.  For a larger room get the 12” which is a superior speaker in many ways.  If you can afford the 12” it is worth the difference.  I got it on eBay from Polk audio cheapest price I could find.
4,Just an echo of many of the other reviewers for the price it's hard to go wrong.  It runs circles around anything of a similar price point.  I wish it had the LFE port which the 12-inch model has but you can recreate this fairly easily when you set it up.  It is a little but uglier than it's modern counterpart the 111 but at less than half the cost I can hide it in the corner.So good sound for a normal to small room at a price point you can afford.  This matches will with either the Polk Monitor Series or the TSi series.
5,This subwoofer works perfectly for our home theater system. You could consider the 12" version with twice the wattage but I can't imagine needing that much base. I use front standing speakers for music without the subwoofer usually so I only need it for movies and shows and this packs plenty of punch. If you're looking for a great sub for the money this will fit the bill.
5,Has great bass and great sound easy to setup.
5,is great for the price
5,Excellent quality at a reasonable price.  Sound enhancement is incredible! Wasn't sure if the 10 inch would produce the bass enhancement I was looking for but I am very satisfied.  I am using it in my bedroom.  Watching movies listening to music or just watching regular cable programming now has the added dimension of enhanced sound. This unit would work in a much larger room.  Great item!
5,My home theater includes a Harmon Kardon 6.1 speaker system and the amplifier in the powered sub stopped working. I researched several avenues including repair by HK replacing the amp with a non-HK brand and replacing the amp with an external. all of those options were quite expensive and having run a Polk sub in my audio system for many years I decided to look at what was available. When I found this sub and considering that the shipping was free (I have Prime) it took me about a minute to order it. Setup was straight forward and took only a few minutes. The unit is black and it is unobtrusive. I tried several different room placements and volume adjustments until I found the best sound and I haven't touched it since. The sound dynamics are incredible.
5,Sounds great. It looks fine. Occasionally doubles as a coffee table due to the size of the room it is in. Otherwise it does a great job of providing immersive base. Compliments my 5.1 system perfectly.I use the auto on feature. Dont worry it picks up right when you need it and wont shut off for 30 minutes or so after you're done.
5,This subwoofer replaced another subwoofer that stopped working (it was over 15 years old). The Polk Audio subwoofer put out more booming lows than the old one. I had to turn down the volume control to about 30% and it still rattles the walls.
5,The Bass this puts out is WOW! if you think you would like to stop just do it this thing rocks BASS you can feel.
5,Upon delivery the box was huge and beat up. But I could care less about the package. The contents inside were intact and looking good. It had a few scratches on it but it didn't concern me. It stays hidden in a corner so appearance didn't matter. Using this in my home theater set up gives your movie a more immersive experience. And this sub will also have your neighbors of 4 years that you've never spoken to knocking on your door. It's a good buy.
4,Cool more than meets my needs.
5,Good product
5,Have 200 watt receiver 2 Bose 301’s hung and a lower mid.Added this and it’s concert level good sound.
4,I recently bought both the JBL SUB12 and the Polk PSW10.  I hooked each sub up to my HK AVR247 to hear the differences between the two.  There were not many when listening to varying types of music.  The real differences could be heard when watching movies.  The JBL could handle loud thundering scenes much better whereas the Polk would emit some air noises from its base port during the same scenes.  Still the Polk is a great bargain for the money and will perform admirably in my family room - the JBL is going into my media room which is under construction.
5,This was a major upgrade compared to the Walmart LG system we had. Works great with our new Sony receiver.Unit is bigger than I expected. One improvement suggestion: make one of the feet adjustable so it can be leveled.
5,I just upgraded to the PSW10 from my 15 year old PSW 8 and wow what a difference. Set up was so simple using just an RCA jack and setting the loww pass to full (because this subwoofer doen't have an LFE input but no big deal. This unit sounds tight at all volume levels. This is my 2nd Polk Audio SW and I have yet to be disappointed!!! Great SWUpdated: just the best subwoofer ever I just bought another one for another room. Love it.
5,Using with a Yamaha surround sound system simply plug and go.  Very clear instructions simple connection with a single sub-woofer cable a few seconds to fiddle with the volume and gain control and it sounds amazing.  I've set it for everyday TV watching and it delivers as it should without the annoying bass boom that can be distracting.  I have readjusted it twice when I want more chest pounding bass and it only took a second.  Very pleased with the finish appearance and performance.
5,Definitely will recommend it!
5,I have two of these set up in a 7.2 Surround sound Dolby atmos setup with a Denon receiver. Dude these things POUND! I mean deep resonant ground shaking bass that rumbles the solid concrete structure of my apartment.Perhaps because my place is solid concrete may positively impact the effects but man they rock hard! For this price..seriously you can't get better than this but I'm sure you could do much much worse.
5,For <$100 there is no better subwoofer out there for your home theater. I bought this to add a little more dynamic sound into my in-wall system and I honestly feel like a complete idiot for not adding one of these sooner.If you're hesitant don't be I've easily gained a third more audio and watching my content is now an entirely different experience as I felt every punch the Punisher threw!Worth every penny.
5,This sub is a great purchase for the price point. I have it hooked up with a pair of Bose PC speakers for in my garage.The neighbors called the cops 5 out of 5 stars
5,Really glad I caught it on sale so now I have a pair of them and boy do they rock. Great way to break them in is by throwing on some good bass movies.
5,It won't make your house entire house rattle but it sounds great and would recommend it to anyone. If you are wanting mega base that pisses the neighbors off spend more money I say that because no one wants to hear your music.
5,Great sound quality for a price and nice addition to my surround sound system. I purchased because of the great reviews and I wasn’t disappointed and you won’t be either!
5,It's for home use.  The sound is great.
5,Well packaged and worked great out of the box.
5,I am a novice at buying stereo equipment.  I purchased this unit and was very pleased with the sound quality and appearence.  There is a volume control on the back of the unit and I had to turn it all the way down to keep it from blasting me out of my living room ( I have a very small living room) but I was very happy this control was there as it made it very easy to adjust.  There is a whole lot of connectors and controls on the back which made it a little more complicated to set up and the instructions are geared for more advanced users.  I am very happy with the performance of this unit and it does shut it self down readily when not in use.
5,Love it good bass worth the price
5,The Polk psw10 is a great little subwoofer with terrific bass! I paid $99 for this wonderful item on Amazon with FREE shipping. I received it in 3 days. I have a surround sound system comprised of all Polk speakers but lacked a subwoofer. My previous NEC sub lasted 28 years before it died a few years ago. It was a 12 inch 100 watt down firing unit that had very good low bass. This Polk sw10 sounds just as good or maybe even better in a smaller package. Highly Recommended.
5,Deep rich bass with no boominess.  Pairs beautifully with Elac speakers.
5,This is the perfect sub woofer for a small room or apartment. Good clear bass for both music and movies easy to connect to most amplifiers both old and new. Don't think you know it all about connecting a sub woofer speaker there is a right and wrong way. Follow the easy directions and you can't go wrong. Correct adjustment of the controls in the back is mandatory to give you the best result.
5,I started by looking at the Polk 8 inch SW. I wanted a decent sub- woofer but wasn't interested in paying lots of money as the room it sits in is pretty small. I took a quick look at the 12 inch Polk and it was only about $30 more. I was tempted to buy that one. It was more than I wanted to pay but certainly well worth a few more bucks. Then I figured I do a search on the 10 inch and much to my surprise it was half the price of the 12 inch. It was even cheaper than the 8 inch. I compared all the specs and could not find any significant difference This speaker was a steal at $89. Very happy with the quality!!
5,This was bigger than I expected (which is a good thing). You can maximize and minimize the bass of it. It is WORTH the price! I set up Home Theater Sound System at our house and got one of there as subwoofer got a Sony Receiver 5.2 from best buy got 2 T50 and a center speakers from Polk Audio for front and for surrounding we have our old Bose small speakers... All sounds really good! Would recommend this Subwoofer!!
5,I have a large family/media room and was a little concerned that a single 10" woofer would not be enough.  I actually have a larger speaker in my car to deliver quality bass.  Well I couldn't justify the cost difference to go up to the 12" and after connecting this to my home theatre I was glad I settled on the PSW-10.  BASS is what I wanted and BASS is what I got.  Great sound quality very crisp and hard hitting bass that gets down into the rumble when you need it.  Helicopters landing get your heart pumping as you can almost feel the rotor spin as it hits crisp and clean for every beat.  Good product the controls are easy to adjust and the finish is clean and modern.
3,You get what you pay for.I'm sure this sub is adequate for those who wouldn't know any better... but coming from a long history (and career) of a audiophile bass head I feel this sub did not add anything more than what my full range speakers are capable of.Luckily this is going in the garage where it will remain. I would not use this in my home theater or in any setup as the primary sub. Its output and frequency range are equivalent to a decent powered computer speakers sub woofer.Looks nice enough and works. Just don't expect to be impressed.On a do-over i would save my dollars until i could get something more substantial.
5,A++++++++++++
3,Grabbed this during a sale so it was about $69 with free shipping. I purchased this to go with a set of Slyvania Musiclites in my bar. The is used 100% for music.The subwoofer does ok at lower volumes and a limited range of frequencies. I've got the crossover set for 80hz IIRC. Anything higher and it has lots of distortion. Volume has to be under 75% or you hear lots of clipping and it generally sounds terrible. Mind you that this is for a grand room so in a home theater environment the levels wouldn't need to be very high.The build quality seems fine I don't doubt it will hold up. Compared to my PSA XS30 it is a cheap toy but if you are not building an audiophile system it should do fine. I would reccomend looking at some BIC America options as my friends have had great experience with those.
5,It has been almost a year and a half of owning this woofer. It has not disappointed me yet.Update: It is now 2021 3 years later and this thing is still kicking ass!
5,Great price and sound for use out in my garage.
5,What a great find!  I got this bad boy when it was $69 after watching it for several weeks.  It has thunderous bass that is tight and not at all muddy.  I paired it with a relatively inexpensive pair of outdoor speakers and a very cheap amp all purchased on Amazon for use in my office at work.  The speakers were okay but when I added this sub wow did it change!  Even at $99 this would be a good buy.  Bottom line Polk makes good stuff and seems to be very reasonably priced for what your getting.
4,Using these subs to match Hsu HB-1 bookshelf speakers. They are a good musical match: tuneful with fast response. Not the deepest or loudest subs around but they add good bass to efficient bookshelf types in a small listening space. Cheap so I bought two for reinforcement. You may need more power in a big room.  I found these subs in an online review of Magnepan MG-12's.  Reviewer looked hard to find subs fast enough for Maggies.  These fit!  That was good enough for me.  Auto-switch feature is just right: 15 minute silence to switch to standby; quick restart.  Pleased with purchase.
5,Pros:  Appearance quality sound ease of use 5 year warranty price.Cons:  Still searchingI hooked this up thru the high level speaker inputs using 10 gauge wire.  With the volume set at halfway the house was rattling and shaking so I turned the volume down to 1/4.  To relieve the fronts of bass duty I turned up the low pass crossover to 140hz.  The bass is tight thumpy well defined but not muddy or boomy sounding.  Though I bought this item primarily for DVD movies I'm really impressed how well it sounds when playing all types of music.  This sub performs well beyond the built in 50 watt amp's power rating.  The only cheap thing about this sub is the price.  I highly recommend it.
5,It works as it should with the y cable not included. I am very pleased.
4,This speaker sounds great for the price....would like it carry the deep bass a little better but overall very good speaker.
5,good sub for the price I bought two for my two RTIA 7 speakers Polk Center and rear
5,This sub offers several options for connections to the audio source. Additionally it adjusts and balances well. I'm very happy with the sound quality and it did wonders for my Samsung surround sound system by replacing the non-powered sub that came with it.
5,For the money a great buy. Placement is important. It is behind me about 2 ft. from my chair. Set to just add lower bass than my PSB tower speakers. Now my audio is full range sounds outstanding.
5,I don't have much experience with subwoofers but I love the contribution this makes to my home theater. It improves every kind of bass from loud car cashes to the light timpani in a symphony concert. I was very impressed with the price. Down right cheap. I don't see any negatives after 3 months.  The nice thing is if set up right you don't hear this speaker only more of whatever you are listening too. More bass more depth more of everything. Especially great for action movies.
4,Best thing is...  It with shut itself off after aprox. 10-15min.  When it detects the receiver is off.
5,Reccomended product.Good sound. 1 fits room of 17" x 21" square foot.Good sound.I am replacing a Bose accoustimas subwoofer and this Polk Audio psw10 makes a good job
5,Great sub from Polk it compliments my two Polk mains HiFi S10s. Thunderous wall shaking bass.
5,Audiophile grandfather loves it
5,Plenty powerful enough to bring sound quality to a new level
4,I would certainly buy again.  Inproved my listening experience and would recommend to all friends.
5,It turns out that speaker break-in is a real thing - at least with the PSW10.  At one point I noticed a nice stylish bass tone with no rumble; then I realized the sub was turned off and the sound was just coming from my Pioneer speakers.  After switching the sub on I didn't notice much difference.  Now after a couple months of occasional use I get a satisfying rumble along with the bass tone from my Pioneers.
5,Polk audio is outstanding! Deep rich powerful bass enhances any audio situation. Simply marvelous... maybe too much for an apartment but they'll have to get over it!
5,Sounds great even compared to my MTX SW12 200 watt ssww.
5,For year I used a sub that came with one of those surround system in a box setups even though I had built up every other piece over time. Changing the old sub out for this one made a world of difference. Can’t recommend enough.
5,Took me a while to figure out the setup (I have a pair of powered speakers) but with a little know-how it's super simple. Update your drivers and balance the levels using a software. Your best bet since this has a built in amp is to pair it with non-powered speakers and adjust using software. Unless you're using for home theater (im using it for my PC) and have some other electronic for equalization.
5,Me encanta el sonido de los bajos
5,It really gives good bass.  I can't crank it up TOO loud or else it distorts but at moderately high volumes it gives plenty of bass for a living room. Too bad subwoofer bass makes my wife physically uncomfortable so I can only use it when she's not in the house :(  I watched this product's price go up and down for 3 months and was able to snag it for $79.99.  I believe it is $129.99 now.  So if you don't NEED a subwoofer immediately wait and watch the price.  It gets down to $89.99 pretty regularly.
5,This Polk product was my second choice. My first choice an Infinity subwoofer with comparable specifications and somewhat more expensive does not have speaker in and speaker out connections. So I took a bet the this Polk sub and could not be happier. With the adjustable crossover and volume and phase switch it's very easy to tweak the settings for your room. I'm using it in office so rarely does it thump but it does do a very good job of reproducing low end at low to moderate volume. If you are looking for audiophile quality you'll need to step up a few notches. If all you want is raw bass you're probably better off with a box with a bigger amp. But of you are looking to add nice low-end sound to a system or home theater this is a good choice.
5,Works so much better than the stock sub.
5,Great if you have 2 of these 10” instead of just 1 12-14”
5,Best sub for the price.  Owned this for several years.  Shakes the house.  Might buy another.
5,👌 great subwoofer bass hits hard but need 2 is better
5,Bought this for my husband and he is really pleased.
5,This sub offers deep rich measured mid and base tones to my entertainment system. I tried going the sound bar route to accomplish the same but the low end on the best units that had bluetooth subwoofers was dissapointing.  So I went old school and ran my 2.1 system thru my Pioneer reciever added this sub and the sound is amazing. When watching a Netflix movie and a jet flys over or a bomb goes off you will duck. An outstanding and unbeatable  circa 1996 solution you wont be dissapointed with.
5,Have had many systems. Love this unit. Denom receiver and look in wall set up.Too much bass. Had to turn down. Never thought I would say that.My last $300 sub was not this good.
5,Replaced an old Optimus sub.  The bass is much tighter and clean.  Great value and sound
5,Great value for a -$100 sub.I now have a forward firing subwoofer to compliment my down firing one in my 7.2 system.I made sure they were set at opposite phases and the results are awesome!
4,A little disappointed that no matter what you do the front grille rattles
2,I have had this for a few of weeks now.  There are two specific issues:- Buzzing at moderately loud volume.  I just discovered this recently since it shows up at a volume louder than I can play when my 4-month-old is home.  Hopefully it's just at this one pitch (song is by Nine Inch Nails I forget which one).  But it's definitely an internal buzzing/vibration not between the (hard) subwoofer feed and my floor.  I may end up taking it apart to try to perform a buzz-ectomy.- "Auto" turn-on and turn-off does not work well.  Our typical use is watching TV / DVDs with audio piped through my Onkyo TX-8555.  When the subwoofer switch is on "auto" and it's off (red light) turning on the TV+Onkyo does not cause it to switch on.  And if I turn it on by flipping the switch to "on" and back to "auto" it will turn itself off while we're watching TV!  Sure we are not shaking the walls while watching Sid the Science Kid but I would expect that the auto on/off would detect ANY level.And in general it's a bit muddy / boomy.  I expected my non-audiophile ears would not be too picky but I can tell there's a lot of room for improvement.I'll update the review if I find any fixes for the issues.
5,Great bass when not pushed beyond 1/2 volumeI have it paired with 2 T50s
5,Reviews i read about the noise was and is normal for a product with a built-in amp. Great buy
5,Very impressed by this sub.  I replaced a Velodyne (think top quality / very expensive) sub with this unit.  The Velodyne had reached its life expectancy and died.  But I have to say this thing sounds just as good if not better.  VERY happy with my purchase!
5,Wow - big box sound for such a great price.  You will be impressed by the size and performance of this subwoofer - works fine with one RCA wire even though it has two inputs on back - which is what gave me pause when researching it because receivers typically only have a single pre-amp RCA output for subwoofer.  You can adjust how much boom this thing puts out - you will like it!
5,An amazing value.  You really can't go wrong for this "price point".  Performance quality fit and finish of much more costly subs. Would buy again.  Note: be realistic.  If you expect it to rock your world like a $1k or $2k Velodyne Sub that you auditioned in a hifi boutique store well you are being ridiculous. I'm planning on getting a second one for the bedroom system.
4,First off I reserched subwoofers for months.  Since i own the Polk R15 bookshelf speakers and a Sony 2ch receiver i narrowed it down to Polk subs. Like others stated 50watts seems weak. My only hookup option was speaker line level inputs. This sub does a heck of a job hits really low with no distortion if setup properly!  Love it and price was $99 and shipping was quick.
5,This subwoofer has far surpassed my expectations. It is much more powerful than our old one so we’re still working on perfecting the balance of all our speakers. Overall it’s a great product especially at this price point.
5,Affordable bass and was easy to setup using Sony DH590 receiver with 5.1 setup on benq TK850 projector
5,It is impossible for me to say a bad thing about this speaker. Don't bother with a bigger more expensive unit this thing floods your room (houseneighbors) with all the bass you expect. Wow is what I say for what it did for my music listening experience Fantastic sound. If your searching for a bass here it is get this one. I am NOT at all sorry i bought this thing.
5,Like this so much I Got two another one.  Only thing I didn’t like about it was the volume controls are behind it on the back that is. if you don’t mind that is a very good subwoofer
4,So far it's been either boomy or too quiet. Guess I need to figure out the settings.
5,Oh my. This thing is bigger than you expect it's got a solid construction and looks beautiful. I connected it to my pc and selected 5.1 and turned off the rear speakers so I have a 2.1 setup and Holy moly at 3/4 volume I'm worried that the floor is going to fall out from under me. I haven't dared turn it all the way up. This thing is potent. Lots more sound than expected and it's pretty. 5/5 would buy again.
5,I'm using this sub with the following; a Denon s500bt some paraighm speakers (4) mounted in the ceiling and a klh center speaker. It works awesome. Plenty loud for me. And I live out in the sticks with no nieghbours to anger so I always play it LOUD. Easy to set up. Easy to control. After playing around with the placement and tracking down the enviromental rattles I love it. The bass booms. I Use it mostly for music and in my honest opion that what it is best for. But it also sounds great for movies too.
5,Would highly recommend great deal for your money!
5,Purchased this sub during an awesome Black Friday sale.  Yes it's only a 50 watt sub but it really puts out the low sounds.  I use this for my home theater not much for music.  My living room is about 15 x15 and it fills the room with sound.  Personally I don't have the sound loud enough to shake the walls as I don't want to wake our kids while my wife and I watch a movie.  The auto on/shut down is also a very nice feature (I just shut down the receiver and never have to think about the sub).  I would definitely recommend to sub to others.
4,Really nice for a small room. The speaker screen arrived with a few dirt smudges but brushed off ok.
3,Makes audible humm during quite scenes. I have it in auto and tried adjusting settings but its pretty annoying.  I unplug it during shows that are predominately dialog. Great enhancement for action movies.
5,We ordered two of these PolkAudio Subs for our shop and upstairs loft and LOVE them. Super great sound quality easy to hook up to our sound system and really make a big difference with how songs sound.
5,Been using this sub with my bookshelf speakers for a few months now. Sounds great together especially for watching movies and listening to music. The bass is punchy and balanced. At this price point it’s a good deal!Highly recommend👍
5,The sub sounds great really gets the low notes going and shakes the house if you crank it. But still provides that deep bass even at a good volume without being overbearing. Needs time to break in I think but for $100 it is really a good sub. It is a lot bigger than I was ready for but I didn't look at the dimensions or anything.
5,I absolutely  love this subwoofer.  It completely  exceeds my expectations.  For $100 I was not expecting nearly as much bass as it puts out. When it is in the basement you can hear it on the second floor.  I have owned it for a couple of weeks and found nothing wrong with it yet.  It adds a very nice element to casually listening to music while also being able to hit hard during parties.  I'm an very satisfied with it so far.
5,great subwoofer for the prizei got this sub to paired whit a set of mackie cr3 series for my pc and let me tell you it is amazing specially for the price rangei own another sub from polk audio they are really good and affordable i bought this PSW10 series couple days ago for $80.00 us dllshere on amazon and now i see the price is higher but still cheap compare to another brandsreally a must get item if you needed for a low budget 2.1 5.1 or 7.1 surround system you wont be disappointed
4,I'm using this to supplement my M-Audio AV 40 speakers. Its pretty damn big bigger than I thought it was going to be. I barely have it turned up half way and have plenty of output. This is in my bedroom but could easily smoke the sub I have in my living room home theater setup. The variable hi pass filter is nice also. It definitely sounds better while I'm sitting at my computer than walking around in my room but I imagine that's room and placement issue. I'm sure the more expensive subs sound a lot better but this is worth the price.
5,This is a very nice  powerd subwoofer for the money you just can't beat it. Go and  purchase one or two ASAP you want regret it.
5,Easy to setup sounds fantastic. Like chunks of steak in vegetable soup not something you expect but real fine if it’s there.
4,Really nice subwoofer but...this things is a lot bigger than we expected. My husband and I purchased this to go with our Vizio sound bar and thought it would be smaller and more compact. We ended up having to find a small table to put it next to the TV. Other than that great sound especially when watching action movies and listening to music!
5,I am not an audiophile by any means so I was just looking for an mid to entry level sub-woofer to pair with a new Yamaha RX-V471BL that I purchased to replace an old Samsung home theatre system.  The reviews were good and the price was right.  I just needed something to satisfy the low bass and provide some "rumble" and this does the trick.  I'm sure that there are better options but this works fine for my purposes (medium sized room).  Easy to install - no issues whatsoever.  Like most decent sub-woofers it does have a toggle switch for On/Auto/Off.  Of course I have it on Auto.  Volume and Low Bass adjustment knobs are available for fine tuning.
5,This is the second powered subwoofer I have purchase for different systems.  I like this one because it faces out and not to the floor.  It functions very well is an attractive component and fits just about anywhere. Polk Audio has a good reputation and this subwoofer meets the standards.If you have a power amp that is only a stereo output this is the subwoofer for you--uncomplicated and easily set up.
5,Very nice sound for the price.  I have three of them now which replaced higher priced competitors subs that failed
5,This subwoofer has great features and performance for the price. I like having the extra input options variable crossover separate volume control adjustable standby and phase control. Works great and it was easy to get it balanced with an existing home theater system. May not be the most powerful but more than enough for a great home theater experience!
5,Polk Audio has always put out solid equipment this sub proves that...
5,This has got to be one of the best bang for the buck subs out there as long as you dont need a pre-amp input. I have this hooked up to some pinball machines. The difference with vs without it is night and day. At first people dont think it is doing much but when you switch it off you instantly can see just how much work it really is doing. If you need an entry level sub you wont find a better deal than this. Highly recommended.
5,We've had this subwoofer for about one month. Unbelievable subwoofer for the money. I bought this to replace a JBL 8" subwoofer that died after twenty years of use. I really liked that old JBL but this Polk is better. I adjusted the crossover according to the instructions and it blends in the bass and sub-bass with our small surround speakers very nicely. No boomy peaks and no gaps. Crank it up and rattle the dishes in the kitchen.
5,It was my first time buying a subwoofer and for first impression it was a good one I would highly recommend the subwoofer.
4,Speaker is a great addition to a sound system. Feet crumble and can potentially damage hardwood floors. Replace the feet with  'Peavey Small Rubber Feet' work great. https://www.amazon.com/Peavey-00051600-Small-Rubber-Feet/dp/B000PWU9CC/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Peavey+Small+Rubber+Feet&qid=1564021158&s=gateway&sr=8-1
2,The speaker sounds great the warranty needs improvement.  After 8-9 months of occasional use a peg that secures the grille broke causing a slight rattle when in use.  I called customer service only to find out the warranty doesn't cover "cosmetic" issues.  They wanted to sell me a new grill for $24.95 - a part which costs them maybe $2.  They did not offer to send a replacement grill.Going back about 10 years I've purchased over 20 Polk speakers - all types and sizes.  This is the first one I've had a problem with and now I may have to consider alternatives for future purchases.  I'm honestly disappointed with their policy especially being a loyal longtime customer.UPDATED 12/1/16Two more grille pegs broke off and under incredibly light use.  This leads me to believe Polk went with an extra cheap manufacture on these or mine is just defective.  As said previously I've owned a lot of speakers - not just from Polk - and have not had a single broken grille peg until this one.  Either way I am very disappointed in the way customer service handled my issue.  There is no way I'm paying $24.95 (plus shipping probably) for a new grille.  That is something that should never break and if it does should be replaced no questions asked.  This speaker is going on craigslist.
5,I guess in order to write a fair review I should read the manual or try some other product features.....but I didn't need to do either. I use the subwoofer's auto sense which turns it on only when an audio signal is being pushed from my receiver. Apart from that it is pretty vanilla as far as operation making this a simple matter of plug and play. It has great range and volume to it. My wife was a little concerned about potential rattle when I sat it on a cabinet holding all the other video/audio gear but the rubber feet on the bottom of the subwoofer are sufficient to dampen potential vibrations. What can I say.....it works great.
5,Awesome sub for the price point.I have two of these splitting signal before a pair of 80's vintage Dahlquist bookshelf speakers. This is all being driven by an also vintage HK 55W amp. This system will get about 90dB tops. Loud enough but not crazy.  But it sounds SO DAMN GOOD.It's not like my main home theater sub a Velodyne that cost 7times as much but I don't aks it to thump 22hz @ 105dB either.
4,This is an OK sub for the money.  It's very boomy and isn't very crisp/punchy.  If you want that I would definitely move on to something else.
5,The sub is awesome for its price and not only for its price. It's just a great performer all-round. Have it hooked up to the Audioengines A2+. If you go above 60-70% of its volume setting it starts to sound boomy which I don't like so I keep it below that setting and it works like a charm. For a typical living room you won't be tempted to go higher than that only if you like boomy ("cheap") bass.
5,Loved it!!! And still going strong!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 does not come with a receiver or a wireless base control
5,I've had this subwoofer hooked up for a few weeks now and I think it serves my needs very well. I mainly wanted it to help give me more low end for my music. I just got some Klipsch towers and missed the low bass I used to get from my old cabinet speakers with the 10" woofers. This sub fills in very nicely. My only complaint is that it takes some time to come out of stand-by especially at lower volumes when you need it the most. I have watched a couple of action movies just to test out the rumble factor. It suits me fine but if you want to rattle windows you should probably spend a little more money and get the 12" or larger.
5,Setup was like any other sub straightforward push-type connectors and crossover/gain knobs.  What's great is the sound this 10 can produce.  I chose a 10 for my little office since the wimpy computer sub wasn't adequate.  At home we have 12's and this 10 while its frequency response isn't as low hits nicely.  But the best thing about this sub is the price.
5,Great sound quality!! Thunder Bass
5,Looks good and the speaker cone is poly so very strong not going to rip like paper cone.  I have been using it for 2 weeks now. With my surround sound for music and movies has great range and power.  The auto off is working well doesn't shut off while I'm watching movies.  A delight to own!
5,very loud and clear. the only downside is that it does "chuff" at half volume from the port not being able to keep up with the air the sub is moving at only 50 of the 100 watt power. however the sound it makes at that level is enough to shake dishes in another room and move the walls of the whole house id rate the bass at loudest about 90 decibels which is great for a home sub i paid about 100$ for.
5,Easy hook up and control. The base is surprisingly clear. Even with the volume up just a little it still comes through great. But when you want to crank it up. It’s kicking stuff off the wall!
5,This sub was so impressive just on its own and at at such an affordable cost less than half of others that I decided to buy another one! I listen to Drum and Bass style music that can really test the performance of subs. This sub hits all the deep wall shaken lows and the tight and punchy mids. Its a best seller cause it is superior quality and affordable cost.
3,This sub did fill out some of the low end for my Bose Acoustimass wall-mounts but something is missing. An the crossover simulator (filter I believe) and volume adjustments are a challenge. I am using it with FIOS tv and the audio is all over the place through their service so that doesn't help. Music also is a challenge because some blues or reggae kicks the bass up very high and you have to turn it down. You switch to acoustic guitar or instrumentals and have to adjust again.So you say "it's not the speakers it's your source material"- correct but the boominess of the bass when just slightly over driven is annoying. There is thundering bass and bass in a 55-gallon drum and bass-loaded music sounds a bit more like the latter. I'm picky- and a bit unhappy but it was cheap (couldn't fit a larger sub (don't let the 10" fool you this is not small).
5,This subwoofer sounds way better than it ought to at this price.
5,I picked this up to pair to a ZVOX soundbar and it’s a really great complement to the midrange sound my soundbar puts out. The build quality is also higher than expected at the cost. I’ve sunk far more money into a Samsung home theater setup that sound much worse and produces weaker and muddier bass than this. Very happy so far.
5,I am not an audiophile. I have pieced together a 5.1 surround from various places and this was the last piece. The room it is in is not very large so the sound is very good for the space we have it in. I like having the knobs on the back to control the volume. That way I do not have to rely solely on the receiver settings. I would highly recommend this to anyone with a small to medium size room that wants bass to be heard. But like I said I am not an audiophile so maybe spending more on another one would tickle your fancy better.
5,For a $100 sub you don't have many options.  The 50 watt amp might make you like it's wimpy but it's not.  For a small to medium sized room it's great.  If you're trying to fill a big room or feel a huge wall of sound when watching a movie then you're looking in the wrong place.This sub is great for music and movies it gives a great smooth sound.  Bass guitar makes the sub sing it has some good kick for bass drum but you may want a sub with a larger amp to feel the kick.  I'm really enjoying this sub no regret what-so-ever.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Hope you found this review somewhat useful.
5,Great performance;  easy setup;  great price;  great value!
5,I bought this subwoofer to pair with my Yamaha 1060 soundbar. The sound went from a 5/10 to a 8/10 with the addition of the subwoofer. It sounds fantastic.  I watched Black Panther on netflix and the added bass sounds amazing. i cant believe I didnt get the subwoofer sooner. I highly recommend this unit and for the price it cant be beat.
5,Lo utilizo para el teatro en casafunciona muy bien.!!
5,I was skeptical at first that this was the Polk Audio entry level sub..the next one up as at $170 so I decided to grab this bad boy for $90 shipped :). I must say...I'm IMPRESSED! My old sub used to make a BOOM or thumping...this one fills the room with true bass (I usually sound test my subs with thunder or other "natural loud noises" to get a feel for it. This will NOT disappoint. I have it hooked up with an audio-rca cable to single line adapter to the back of my Yamaha RX-V377. along with 4 other Polk Audio speakers (TSi100's and T15's)
4,Only reason for one less star is because there is a slight hum when on standby
3,my old JBL 10" subwoofer had better sound.  unfortunately it burned out after 10 years.The Polk has a muddy bass and placement matters.  in setting the crossover and listening to a jazz tune with walking bass I never could get the bass precise with a decent volume.My best results are with the Polk on top of a piece of granite the crossover of the bass is still not smooth but the bass is more precise.  I would say the Polk for audio music is adequate.for surround sound blu-ray video playing I think the Polk is better than the native TV speakers although explosions still don't have quite  feel immersive.  at any rate the surround sound system does sound better with the Polk than without for action movies.
5,Easy to connect rumbling loud bass what else do you need out of a sub? Works surprisingly well with my sound bar.
5,My last house had Polk Audio surround speakers installed in the ceiling and I got super spoiled by the theater-like experience. My living room is much smaller now so I paired this with a pair of Polk Monitor 70 Series II speakers and I couldn't be happier! I don't have rear channels anymore but frankly I don't miss them. Movie night is still theater quality. I drive everything with a Sony STR-DH770 receiver.
5,This sub rocks nice addition to my surround system.
5,Works best off of RCA Inputs.
5,Every thing sounds awesome.
5,I am very happy with this sub. It works with my other Polk speakers creating a vibrant addition to the 7.1 surround setup. The price was right. I chose this sub based on other good reviews here at Amazon. I have no complaints about it. The frequency response is great. I've never owned a sub before so I don't know what a bad sub sounds like. This one sounds great to me. Explosions ROCK the house but do not wake the neighbors.The build quality is top notch. ALL of the Polk Audio gear I bought from Amazon has had top notch quality to the speakers and cabinets. None of my stuff was DOA. The packaging was great as was the documentation.I highly recommend this product.
4,I bought to replace a blown sub for my entertainment system. Works great!
5,I bought this sub today and it came in I inboxed it and plugged it in to my Yamaha RX-V583 and it sounds so much better! I thought about buying it for a long time and today I finally folded and it does not dissapoint! I was missing out on all the bass in my surround that I mostly use for music!
2,I didn't really know what port noise sounded like until I tried this subwoofer out. It sounds exactly like a fart or somebody blowing raspberries when the woofer excursion is great at high volume and very low frequencies. I had bought this to replace a MTX SW1 down-firing sub I've had in my theater for ten years but the amp recently got fried by a lighting strike. I was disappointed with the Polk but decided to salvage the Polk amplifier for my old sub. I widened the amp cutout on my old sub with a jigsaw and dropped the Polk amplifier in and it sounds great!  While I had the two cabinets apart I took out the speakers to compare and the MTX 10" speaker weighed twice as much as the Polk with a much larger magnet and spider basket. The Polk's speaker magnet is small but it has a much wider foam surround than the MTX speaker so that is why the amp just throws the speaker cone around so much that it sounds loose with no punch. If I could give the Polk amp a separate star rating I would give it a 4 or 5 but with the awful speaker and port noise I have to give the total package a 2.
5,This subwoofer is a Polk Audio dream! It is floor standing and the subwoofer is on the front. The sound is incredible and really brings out the very lowest frequencies. It has a black finish and a front grill (not shown). I purchase it along with the same finish front channel speaker and also 4 of the tower speakers all from Polk Audio. The company is sound and produces a high quality line of speakers. I am VERY pleased! Thank-you!
5,Bought this from Amazon 01/25/2015 paid $129 and thought that was a deal.  At $89 it becomes a "no-brainer".  This was the last piece of the puzzle for my hodgepodge 5.1 sound in the bedroom.  Like everyone says "this really is powerful and no distortion."  If you are sitting on the fence go ahead and pull the trigger on this.  You will not be disappointed...
5,This sub sounds awesome.  The wattage might scare you away but don't let that bother you.  I have mine in a 20X20 living room and it is TOO loud sometimes.  I have to adjust the level on my Sony receiver.  That should tell you that the amp and sub are matched perfectly.  Movie sound effects sound great and music sounds awesome.  Whether you are into rap or classical this sub sounds amazing.  and under $100......you can't lose.
4,The bass could be a little more crisp however overall it does compliment any home theater system
5,This thing is so powerful; you can set it to literally hop around your room and dance with you.Great product....great value....some great capabilities in that box. Can plug it into anything.
4,I love Polk Audio products. When I saw this for $100 I had to jump on it.It is a good sub but not great. It is easily overwhelmed and doesn't do good with very deep and loud bass. This is more for listening to light music that isn't too heavy.For the price its very good - But I wish it was still a little better. I have some no brand subs that sound better albeit they were more expensive.Polk shouldn't water down its brand with sub-par products.
4,Bass is a little muddy but all in all not a bad unit
5,Easy hook up and sounds great!
5,Polk is an industry leader in audio products and this sub-woofer definitely falls in line with that. For only $100 this woofer adds such great depth to my surround sound system (Onkyo Tx-NR616 receiver + Pioneer Sp-FS52-LR tower speakers Pioneer SP-C22 center and Pioneer SP-BS22 Bookshelves).First impressions:*Great tight bass for music*Solid low end boom when watching movies*Great for a variety of music- played some Rap and dubstep and hit HARD then played some Shins and Ben Folds and sounded so clear and tight (without heavy bass echo)Concerns:*Would be great if it had an LFE input*I used a y-cable to connected my LFE output to the two RCA input jacksI would HIGHLY recommend this to other users!
5,well to be honest i was not expecting to be blown away givin' its only a 10 but wow was i pleasantly surprised!! this is my first polk product and i gotta say im really interested in mor polk stuff now! this thing knocked pictures off the wall and stuff was falling off tables all over my room (standard sized bedroom) im gonna have to invest in a ton of velcro!! it out performs the living room system (1000 watt teac receiver 2 12inch acoustics speakers & 12 inch sony 500 watt sub) the bass is deep punchy and full and very loud without that weird overly "boominess" i have noticed with alot of subs this is a steal for the price and a really impressive unit highly recommended
5,Wow- this thing pumps.  I purchased a Denon AVR-591 3 weeks ago and convinced the wife that using my old Yamaha surround sound/sub speakers with this receiver is like driving a Porsche with tires from Discount Tire Company.  So I purchased the Polk Audio PSW10 along with the RM75 satellite speakers.  When I started researching what to buy I actually thought that maybe the PSW10 wouldn't be enough for my HT.  But quickly I learned that I probably won't be able to enjoy the full potential of this sub.  We live in a town home(end unit though) and gotta kid on the way.  No late night here!My den is about 14'x 16' with a knee wall separating the dining area.
2,I really hate giving such poor reviews. However in this case it was necessary. Let me just say that overall the sound quality was acceptable and I did like that there were active gain and high pass filter controls. That being said I just couldn't live with the constant hum coming from amplifier. Tried many different setups to no avail.This was a home office application so I returned it for an 8" Monoprice sub and have been extremely happy with the decision.
5,This sub pumps out the bass.  Great value and a great product!
5,Muy buen subwoofer lo recomiendo
5,Amazing subwoofer suits my needs and has more than enough range and bump for my music needs. I have it sitting in front of me under my keyboard and PC setup. Music sounds excellent and bass is smooth and I paired this with polk audio speakers. Best bang for my buck sensational quality and boastful sound. I think this is probably the best you can get for entry level devices.I've connected the sub via speaker wire because my subwoofer RCA input is wayy too rusted. Regardless it still sounds great no distortion or fuzzy noises.No regrets here!
4,Bought as part of a set. Great sound was not expecting from a smaller speaker.
5,I'm sold on Polk Audio speakers as I've have great experience with them before with home and car speakers. It provides solid distortion-free bass at even high volume. It has an auto-on/off option and lets you tune the cutoff frequency to custom tune it to your room or system. You can spend much more on other sub-woofers but my ears are very happy with this.
5,Absolutely amazing value.  This is the not the best subwoofer money can buy but for the price you can't beat it.  It is ULTRA responsive in terms of what frequencies it will pick up.  I haven't come across anything that doesn't sound crisp and clean on it.  You may be wondering "will it go loud?  It's only 50 watts RMS!"  Yes it will go extremely loud and it will sound crystal clear while doing it!
4,I have been a fan of Polk Audio since I was in High School. I'll have my AARP card soon if that says anything. I am also a Stagehand of 19 years. I bought the PSW10 specifically for my laptop. Now when I am listening to music or a movie from my laptop It can be heard loud and clear. It became the punch for a pair of Harmon Kardon computer speakers that also run with a middle of the road surround system off my laptop. People have a hard time believing the source it is all coming from.
4,Not an audophile by any means and don't have an awesome home theater setup (i'm strictly 2.1 kind of guy lol).  I mostly play video games or listen to music with this sub and it sounds great for either.  You have to mess with the knobs on the back and play it by ear to get the sound you want it isn't going to sound perfect straight out of the box.  Crank it all the way up and will hammer through your house but I keep it about mid-way because I have neighbors.
5,Was the text message I sent my wife after hooking up this unit! Until now I'd been running the cheesy unpowered sub that arrived with my 2003 era surround sound system. Along with wiring up in-ceiling speakers I added this sub for a little extra kick. Movies and XBox are a whole new world.It was out of the box plugged in and shaking the windows in my family window in a matter of a couple minutes.Be advised: I am NOT an audiophile. I think it sounds great but I can't speak with experience to the quality of the sound produced. My uneducated ears love the results though. For the price this is a great choice for any recreational user.
5,Crystal clear bass.  I am a old guy that loves to feel the bass and with the PSW10 it will vibrate your skin and move the clothes you're wearing.  Polkaudio is still the best subwoofer brand out there!!!
5,Bought these to use on the left and right of my theater system and I like how they shake the floor. These are on my 86in LG screen which I refer to as "The IMAX". These sub-woofers add to the thunderous feel of the Yamaha processor.
5,I have a modest system in my basement with russurround inceiling speakers Yamaha RX-V371 receiver and needed a sub to get that extra bass.  I was not looking to get anything that would rock the house but something that is modest so I can get discrete bass mainly for movies.For music it accentuated the lows without any distortion and not overbearing.  For movies I was able to feel the bass in action scenes.  It was more than loud enough for my small home theater.  I have pushed it some...you will get distortion on loud volumes and this is not an audiophile's subwoofer.  However for an entry level system which is all that I need this sub gets the job done.
4,Paired with my Elacs 2.0 6.2 and it sounds great!
5,I set this up in our movie room.  We have a Bose Acoustimass and there really is not a true subwoofer (at least that's what my daughter boyfriend tells me).  Not sure if I even have it set in the right place my husband is no help.  I just plugged it in to the back of the Denon reciever and put it to the side of the room.Our first movie using this was Finding Nemo :-)  I had it set at about medium and WOW... we have theatre seating and the seats were shaking during some scenes. .  It really added to the movie.  Very happy with purchase.
5,Without doubt or regret this unit provides solid performance in my 16' x 36' room. The enclosure is flawless. I mated this sub with a Pioneer SP-C22 Center and four Pioneer SP-BS22-LR Andrew Jones Designed speakers with a Yamaha RX-V373 5.1 amp. In this size room one may not find a better value system to put together than this. Those who would use their system principally for music listening may opt for two Pioneer SP-FS52-LR Andrew Jones Designed Floor standing speakers for fronts. With these speakers I am able to leave the crossover determination to the amp. In fact the Pioneers nicely handle much of the low-end spectrum that's common. When the Polk is called upon to do its job it satisfies.
5,The bass is high quality and can really put out the sound.  Great adjustments knobs for depth and volume.
5,Needed for small apt without spending a lot of money. Complements my system very nicely. I don’t blast it because I’m in an apt bldg but rounds out my 2-channel audio extremely well. That’s not to say it doesn’t sound great at higher volume but a great alternative if you don’t want to shell out for a Klipsch.
5,Polk audio really did something right here! For the $90/129.99 (on prime day/normal day) price tag this is amazing. The bass will shake your room and it has both speaker line (which I use) and RCA inputs to cover any system. No many subwoofers give you multiple input options. I highly recommend!
4,The sub sounds great but it is on the small side for a large room. Overall I am happy with the purchase and was VERY happy with the price - this speaker was excellent value for money at $85.You do not need to have two channel input. A single subwoofer line in to either the left or right channel works fine.You do need a quality RCA signal input. As the sub is self amplified it is sensitive to signal noise so ensure you have a good cable from your amplifier subwoofer output to your subwoofer input.
4,It's can be tricky to balance the sub with your other speakers but with patience you can get a killer sound. I paired mine with some vintage Miller-Kreisel speakers and am very satisfied. It's not perfect but it's pretty close. I replaced a 12 inch Miller-Kreisel powered sub with this one and it holds its own. I would get it again.
4,Sounds great but I wish it had more power.Power is adequate for the most part but sometimes I wish I was able to turn it up a little more.  If the power was closer to 100W it would be perfect.
4,For $79 this is a great sub. Doesnt have an LFE jack so I had to get a splitter so it would take the LFE cable but this product does what it says. My JBL Sub 150 was a great sub and this is a step down for me...but acceptable. At least I wont have to straighten the pictures on the wall anymore lol.For the price I suggest this. This was my second choice. I had ordered a larger sub from Amazon but it was damaged and there were no more in stock. So I got this.
5,Not sure what all the negative reviews are about.. This sub works and sounds awesome! I'm 31 and have been a stereo junkie since 13. I'm going to assume the negative reviews are due to poor placement or cranking it b4 u break it in..I've had this beauty pounding many days with no port noises whatsoever! As for the 50rms/100watt Max amp well it pushes this badboy just fine. Home audio tends to have less wattage than that of car audio. But if u let that fool u.. Well u may b a fool yourself. And at $89 I paid from Amazon u can't go wrong. Period!
5,Absolutely Amazing. This unit compliments a Vizio vsb200 sound bar. If I let it this baby would vibrate all the doors in my house. Highly recommend especially at this price point. I was on a budget I'm not sure what the units that are 3 or 4 times the price could possibly offer. Maybe for a huge home... my living room is probably 15' X 20". PLENTY of power for me!
4,Bought this to complete my 5.1 surround sound setup in the living room of my apartment. Overall it's worth the $90 or so bucks you'll pay for it. However if you have a large living room I highly suggest going with something a little more powerful. If you have a smaller living room or live in an apartment and worry about angering your neighbors this is the correct way to go.
5,I just replaced my old 10" Optimus Subwoofer with the Polk PSW 10 and wow! What a difference. After connecting the unit I put the sub right at the same location and re calibrated the system in my Onkyo. The sound is far superior and the bass is really clear and powerful. I will use the old sub as a second unti located right behind our couch.I am very satisfied with this purchase. I strongly recommend it.
5,Strong as always from Polk. This has a great crossover and true stereo inputs. Has to be best bang for the buck around.Sounds great with my other Polk gear and my older high end Klipsch towers. Perfect balance
5,Fit my needs for a small but good sounding and relatively inexpensive subwoofer.
5,My previous PC audio systems were Dell Logitech and Altec Lansing.  All of them had decent Sub Woofers but this one beats them all!  This thing has power and super low end frequencies.It doesn't power my speakers but I added it to handle my 5.1 surround setup from my PC and it definitely is worth the $99
4,Very good!!! other than some port noise which can be fixed by taking off the back screws to remove the amp and taking off the port cover; then it will be fixed. This sub very very good for its price. It sounds much more powerful than its rated 50 watts rms.
5,I upgraded my old broken subwoofer; which was a monoprice brand to the Polk brand and it just blew me away. Deep bass and very easy to adjust. I used the old Cardi B song and it just sounded perfect. If you are ona budget like me this is your must buy. It will impress you. Plus I have a small place.
5,Good bass sound quality very good appearance
5,5-stars for value - at this price point can't beat it. Some may find it insufficient for large space but works fine for me. Like that it has line and speaker level input/output and auto on switch.
5,Love how this sounds when playing either CDs or you tube on tv
5,Great bass sound at a great price!!
5,This replaced an older Yamaha 8" sub which was great for a smaller room but since we moved to a bigger house I got this. Works great for me but my ears are shot from being a heavy jet mechanic for 30 years :)  Seriously though it is very good. Oh and the room it is in is about 14X16' with hardwood floors
5,Bought 2 / love em changed they way I watch movies. With the extra thump  can't takey eyes off the screen  can't wait for that next magical thump/ fills my heart with lots of joy.
5,After my old surround sound system took a crap on me I purchased a used one. It did not come with a subwoofer so I used the one from my old system but it just wasn't up to snuff. I researched and decided on this unit and couldn't be more pleased. It is robust and has the punch one expects from rumbling engines explosions and deep bass voices.
4,I got it about a month ago it's hooked up to a Onkyo TX-NR515.  If you're looking for a huge system that can take anything at any volume then why are you looking at 10" subs at all.  Bit if you're looking for something to brace up your Blu Rays music etc. in a medium to large room and your cost conscious then you seriously cannot do any better than this.  I've owned and heard subs that cost 4x more than this that vastly under-preformed.  This is a solid sub at an insane price.
3,Meh. Bass breaks up at mode-volume. Sounds decent for the money. Gonna gift this 10” and give the Klipsch R-125 a go.
5,Very happy about 4 weeks into purchase.  Unit is kind of large but its large enough and made well enough you could put a cushion on the top and use it as a small seat.  My stereo has a single subwoofer out so per the user manual (a must read you could harm your TV if you don't) I turned the "low pass filter" fully clockwise.  Didn't touch volume once I hooked it up it sounded so good (no sub at all before) with my mediocre (at best) satellite speakers that there was no need to adjust it.
5,Replaced an old 8” Sony that worked great for years. What a difference. I’d recommend this.
4,Great base for the price but do check the dimensions before you buy. I didn’t and was very surprised when it turned up. It’s huge!
5,Work great.  Nice deep bass
5,Love the power. The volume knob is way too sensitive as just one centimeter from 0 is almost too much. The sound is very smooth not anything like a muddy sound I was expecting. I was pleasantly surprised. When watching movies it literally brought the movies yo life and I would forget I wasn't in a theater.
4,The bass is pretty good. I haven't had a chance to mess with the settings too much but for some reason the bass can be heard almost louder up on my second floor than in the room it's in (basement). I have it set up with a Denon receiver that's an entry level receiver so I don't have too much control over the bass settings but when it's turned up the whole house shakes! Exactly what I was looking for.
5,Had this exactly 1 day but been listening in conjunction with a pair of 8" studio reference monitors and very pleased with extra bottom end without being overly boomy.  Heck of a deal with current Black Friday discounts.
4,Great value for the price! Got the sub during Prime days for $90!!  Sm/Md room with 5.1 Infinity towers/surrounds. Pairs well
5,Great sub woofer and for less than $100 it can't be beat. I have this hooked up in my 7.1 surround sound system. With my Denon AVR X-2300W and all Polk speakers and the sound is amazing The bass is loud and booming if you want it to be. Or deep and rich if you want it to be. You will be satisfied with this sub no matter what.
5,Far better sound quality than I had anticipated. It's not going to knock you on your butt but if your system is lacking a little punch this will do the trick!
5,Great sub under $100.  Can't go wrong with this Polk.  I use it with my denon m-39s and it completes the system making it sound 10x better.  Easy to setup and adjust sound.
5,I think the Polk PSW10 was the perfect buy. I was looking for a sub that would be used with my computer sound system primarily for music...and then for the occasional movie. With the Poik sub taking care of the lows I can now let my smaller JBLs and Optimus bookshelf speakers take care of the mids and highs - it sounds AMAZING.If you are looking for remarkable audio quality but don't want to break your wallet the Polk PSW10 is probably the best low-end sub available.I like many others considered this sub alongside the 12" Sony...but I read so many good things about the bulid quality of this sub and decided that was more important to me.And yes it's plenty loud :).
5,I bought two of them and connected them to my Pionner elite receiver and oh man! I’m not an experience sound engineer or anything like that but I can say these subs are loud and I’m only at 50% on the volume. I know there’s a lot of high end subs out there but for the price you can’t beat these.  I highly recommend it.
5,This sub rocks!  This is the 2nd one I've purchased.  I have this one hooked up in my man cave and the lows on this thing is insane.  Honestly it should be priced a lot higher.  It's a steal at $89.  I already had 2 twin speakers for clarity but I needed some good thump.  It pumps out good thunder and makes my man cave shake.  2 thumbs up!
5,Excellent sound quality.  Good value for the price.
5,Love it love love it!  It has transformed my music and tv experience. How did I not have this woofer or any subwoofer for the last 45 years? I think it's a good price and well built. Use it every day. My neighbors bring it up (occasionally) on the boom quality. Love it!
5,I’m no audiophile and this is a $100 subwoofer.  I replaced a broken Subwoofer and this one certainly did the job on my video system.  I’m very happy.
5,Great sound for a smaller sub.  Paired with a soundbar this improved my LR movie experience by a TON.  Reputable brand and I knew I would not be disappointed.  From Primus on Pandora to Saving Private Ryan on Amazon this is a solid choice for budget home theater.
5,Love it and will be buying another one soon to replace an old one. Very happy!
4,Works great very happy. Was larger than I had realized but that wasn't an issue.
5,Great sound. My 5.1 system is now complete.
5,Used it in my basement whole place shakes on 60hz and below distorts above half volume though. This is the best price for beginner bassheads. I mean you could technically go off on the SVS PB16’s right off the bat but that’s like buying a Hummer mounted rotary blitz minigun with only airsoft pellets for ammo.
4,Good Solid Sub...thats all there is to it.  I mainly use this product for music and it preforms very well.  It recreates bass with astounding accuracy.  This is a great product for a low price but when turned up to a high volume it is plagued by air chuffing noises.  Also if you intend to use this for movies with explosions gunshots etc... look elsewhere as this sub doesn't get very low or loud.  This is a great entry-level sub for music just be careful you now what product you are looking for.
5,I have 2 other subs in different parts of the house but wanted one for outside. This sub fits the bill. It’s deep and loud. I have more expensive subs with higher wattage as well as my 18” electrovoice sub with 1100 rms. I know what high quality and power sounds like. This is no cheap computer speaker system sub.
5,I buy these as an inexpensive entry level sub for my customers and it works great. The price to sound ratio is great and everyone is always impressed with the way it sounds. It can get a little muddy sounding at higher volumes. I usually keep the volume adjustment knob on the back between 50-75% and that seems to work out about right. I have tried a couple other brands around this price range but this one is by far the best. If you are looking for a good sounding inexpensive sub I would not hesitate to recommend this product.
5,Sounds good.
5,WOW. Simply WOW! I searched for a quality sub for a long time. I read the review on this and thought for $100 how could I go wrong. It sounds so great I ordered a second one for my other system. I don't give a five star rating likely so take my word this is great for the average homeowner with kids and family that likes good base for movies and music.
5,please understand the 5 stars is because i'm considering the price point.  for around a hundred bucks this little sub does few things wrong. it will not nor would anyone expect it to perform with a high end sub.  but if you have a modest home theater system and do no want to spend much $$  this sub may be for you.
5,I have installed many surround sound systems for friends family and clients and this is the sub I keep recommending to anyone who is trying to keep costs down without sacrificing quality. Sure you can pay several times as much and get a better sub but for most living room systems this sub will be more than adequate. In fact to see any noticeable improvement you'd have to be looking around the $500 price point. I usually buy it in black but the cherry finish is beautiful if it matches your decor.
5,I cannot believe how much I love the bass sound in this speaker. The low end bass and kick drums have come alive!
5,Great subwoofer and amazing value for $100-$150.  It more than fills my 10x10 room and I keep the volume/gain at halfway.  I have a Sony BVD 3100 HTIB and replaced the factory passive sub with this Polk.  Night and day difference and something anyone with a HTIB should do as well.  All you have to do is cut and strip the speaker wire going to the factory sub and connect to either the L or R audio-in channel on the Polk.  You won't be disappointed.
5,I am a musician and I enjoy surround sound.  I always thought that subwoofers were for loud action movies but then I realized that the subtle low frequency bass sounds add so much to regular TV and commercials.  This particular unit is amazing (I've tried some others in this price range).  I keep it in the corner of a 14x25 room and have the other 5 speakers in the appropriate places.  I forget the surround sound is on sometimes until I hear that beautiful low cello sound during a movie dialogue or a fun commercial with a cool bass line.  Highly recommend.
3,Ok.  First of all I have to let you know that I purchased 2 of these for my Man-Cave.  Together they sound really good.  Alone I don't think it would be strong enough for my taste.Pro's: Built solid.  Looks good.  Sounds good for less than $100.Con's: Can only have the "gain" up to 50% any higher and it sounds distorted.  The grill on one of my subs rattles when the base hits real hard... but the other sounds fine.  If you take off the grill it goes away.  But the biggest thing is that you can't turn the "gain" up past 50% or so because you will hear a lot of distortion.Watched Terminator Salvation last night.  Sounded really good nice bass... but I also have 2 of these.Would have gone with a Polk 12" like the 505... i think that's what my brother has.  Thats hits real good and sounds real nice.All in all.... I am happy with them but I wish they were able to do what is expected of them.
3,I had a polk audio sub for 12 years paid about 250 or so and it was great.  It just blew and I bought this one. I bought it for the price price and because it was polk.  figured it would be solidwhile I'm not expert on sound this subwoofer gives very bland bass flat and very shallow.  it does not give the nice bass sound that is vibrant and rich and extends to the whole room.  The best description I can give is the bass doesn't last short and flat.  Instead of a booooooooooom that continues it's like boom stop boom stop  If you want better bass i would spend more.  It works for me in the short term and 3 stars for price and it works.  But not rich sounding at all. If figure out how to make this better i will edit review.
5,This fills the hole in the system i needed. I am not a bass lover however it does take a load of my tsi100 speakers allowing them to handle upper frequencies better the singers actually sound richer an of course the deep clear base sounds rounds out the sound as well. As i said no thump thump thump here just good sound
4,good
4,Consider your set up. Very big bang for your buck. However is less effective if you want to play your music quietly it can seem almost underpowered i guess. Basically subtly is not its strong point. But definitely works well if you plan to listen to music above background noise level.
4,WONDERFUL bass. It was a great addition to the setup. However I am not sure if this is something I did (I never dropped it bumped it or anything) maybe careless shippers but in some frequencies there is sort of a rattle noise coming from inside. It's a tweet sort of and sounds like something is loose/vibrating. This WOULD get 5 stars if this problem was not present but I don't think I can blame that on Polk
4,This will do nicely while I save up for my flagship.
4,I bought a Polk audio suround sound set about 8 years ago at circut city and this is the subwoofer that came with the package. For some reason the subwoofer from the package (that I had for 8yrs)got blown out and I needed to replace it. Although the psw10 looks different from the one I had the specs are identical. Although I think the psw10 seems to have better sound and responce. You can't go wrong with this subwoofer for a low to midrange home theatre system and the big bonus is the low price.
5,I love this subwoofer! I bought a more expensive one previously to go in another room that has a low hum and we have to turn it on and off which is annoying. Not this Polk! There is no hum at all and I keep it on non stop. It works beautifully! The sound is fantastic. I have it paired with Micca speakers and a Pioneer receiver.
5,Great sub.  Great seller  extremely fast shipping
5,Great sound and great price
5,I have the Polk PSW-10 in my shop to complement my four Kicker KB6000's connected to a Yamaha RS-202 and WOW! Talk about a Thump! It is absolutely amazing! Sampling a little George Strait and my wife comes out next thing I know we're 2 stepping around the shop like we was at the dance hall! Highly Recommend!
4,great sound to make a cheap set up sound much better!
5,Works great with my new Denon 750 system! Great quality for the money
5,Great sound. The only thing is that is automatic shut off so you don’t have an actual button to turn it on or off. Other than that is pretty cool
5,after 20 years of on again and off again use of my first surround system this was my choice to replace a 20 yr Kenwood 8 inch powered sub. More than happy with the bass supplied by this unit. Hooked up with older Yamaha's  front and back this sub makes a big difference in the lows when watching movies. I actually have it powered down so the satellites that run off this sub do not overwhelm the other set which are used up front. Definitely a good choice for my rebuild this is Powered by an Onkyo surround receiver. The Yamaha's and center speaker are next to replace and POLK will be a first look.
3,When i took it out of the box there was something rattling around on the inside. i didn't want to open it up to see what could be loose inside or go through the hassle of boxing it back up and lugging it to the Post Office so I hooked into my system and it really sounds amazing. Going to try not to move it around much.Don't know what inside and i guess I don't want to find out.I would have gave it a 5 if it didn't have something loose inside.
5,Amazing I could not have chosen a better affordable and quality product
3,This sub works however i does not work as great as i would like it to. In my living room which is about 13ft by 16ft with 9 ft ceiling the woofer moves but i do not hear the base. It is silent just vibrating. In my bedroom which is smaller the sub does better job filling it up with base. This sub will probably be enough for small room with carpet. But for large open space it will not work
5,Purchased for $97.00 needed to get a sub but wasn't ready to get a bigger one yet so I purchased this to hold me off till then.  That being said this is a pretty great sub and I don't think you could find a better one for the price.  Well built and easy to setup.  The biggest thing is know what you're buying this is by no means a room filler for a room larger than 10'x10' and based on what I got for the price I don't know how you can rate it lower than 5stars if you researched beforehand solid buy for anyone who wants a little more bass and doesn't have that large of a room.
5,Sounds great. Big Bass. Diablo 3 sounds awesome.
5,Great subwoofer.  So great I’ve found I need to turn it down as the night goes on so I don’t keep my next door neighbor awake!
5,We remodeled our basement and added surround sound.  I actually hide this bass speaker inside a closet behind my couch. It works really well. Great sound - even though the wall.
5,Works great! Live the microphone adjustment feature.
5,Amazing subwoofer from polk audio. All of the speakers ive ever bought from polk always have sounded great. I have had car audio and home audio from polk and for home audio out of the brands i have had including sony and other this is by far the best i have used. The output is perfect for any home theater setup.
5,Nice looking works as advertised sounds good!Not in the same class as a very high end unit but works and sounds very good for the price.Polk audio come thru again.
5,Good quality very good
3,It is one of the cheapest price 10" sub on Amazon.  It is boomy as expected.  However the volume is too low.  I connected the sub out at the receiver (receiver does not have LFE) then used a Y to connect to the sub L & R.  With the volume all the way up and 80Hz cross over I can barely hear the bass.  After doing some research I was able to set the sub volume to the max in the receiver (an increase of 10 db more).  The bass was still on the weak side.  I don't know if it was my 14 yr old receiver or the deffective sub or may be the sub is designed that way.  I have not heard the port noise rattling.
5,This subwoofer is great. I am not an audiophile so this is just a normal person review. I plugged it into my Denon Receiver and all of the sudden there was a rumbling sound when it was appropriate. I had not bothered to own a subwoofer since I've had my current setup (a few years) and since I just bought a new receiver I figured it was a great time to get one.
4,This sub is much better than the one I had. It's fantastic for music but lacks a bit for the large deep sound fx in movies. Doesn't seem to handle the real punchy stuff without a bit of distortion. All in all a great value for the price.
5,I have a carver peamp connected to a quad amp system totaling 3500 watts feeding two JBL 4343 studio monitors featuring 18 inch woofers that move a lot of air.however this powered sub is fantastic in low end resonance for a quick turn on and listenmy only knock is having to manually adjust volume when attached to a fixed output (sumsung 8550) tv. I have puchased two of these and are primarily used in conjunction with tv out putI have considered installing a small remote power amp to resolve audio volume situation.
4,I ordered the   Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer (Single Black)         to go with my   Yamaha CRX-330BL Micro Component Receiver CD Player Unit         and bought   Belkin PureAV AV20500-15 15-Foot Subwoofer Audio Cable         to connect them.  It turns out you also need a   Monster ILJRY-1 F Single Female RCA to Dual Male RCA Y-Adapter         to feed the signal into both channels of the subwoofer or it doesn't work right.  Once I got all the components it's fine but it took a week and two orders to figure it all out.
5,Just right!
5,Given as gift. Son raved about the sound quality
5,This is just what we needed to complete our home stereo system... Nice bass box! Sounds great!
5,Running two of these for a 5.2 set up in a basement media room does what they are supposed to do- bang for the buck to watch movies they are enough. 80hz cut.
5,I already owned polk PSW125 which I love but needed a smaller woofer for a different room. I had this subwoofer on my wish list for a while then decided to buy it when the price came down to $69. I will say for the price this is an amazing woofer. The sound is deep and clear especially for the movies. The trick for this sub is finding the right placement in the room for it. I had to experiment with different parts of the room to get the best sound.  I would recommend this sub to anyone who wants a nice bass without wanting to spend a lot of money.
5,For the price and the size this subwoofer sounds great!  It has as auto-on feature that turns the subwoofer on when it gets a signal and turns it off after 15 minutes of use.  This is an essential feature to save power and extend the life of your subwoofer.It packs a lot of punch for the little package.  There is an adjustment for how much base you want.  I leave it at the default which is plenty but if you are a basehead you could turn it up.  When I'm playing music in the living room and I go into the basement this is the only part I hear.
3,The sound is ok. Not impressive compared to my old and smaller woofer but good enough for the price I guess. Then why 3 starts? The speaker-level outputs work only if you use the speaker-level inputs. Of course I started with sub-woofer cables which is superior to speaker cables and thought something was wrong with the signal source because the speakers connected to the speaker-level outputs terminal didn't make any sound. After wasting a lot of time I realized it wouldn't put out any signal to the speaker-level outputs terminal if it's connected to the signal source via the line-in ports. Why? Just why??
4,Works well with my T50 floor standing tower speakers but it took a while to get it [the volume and other settings] just right. I initially found myself having to adjust the volume knobs often which are at the rear of the subwoofer.
5,Wow - this thing delivers crisp and deep bass effortless. I have it set up in my garage (I have a pretty nice set up for watching movies) and on a very low setting it adds that perfect amount of bass for movies and music that rounds out the sound nicely. On a high setting it will rock the house!
5,This woofer is awesome. I place it in the center of the house and all the floors are shakin. Definitely will purchase again.
5,i bought this subwoofer 2 years ago it was an amazing subwoofer.When i bought it i was just starting out on what to buy. If i knew what i know today about wattage i would probably of never bought it but 50w?!?! no way this is only 50w rms it rattles my house it is amazing. im going to buy another one soon saying i hooked it up in a friends car after he bought it off me and he blew it. But ive missed this sub and im going to get it again shortly dont look at the rms it means nothing on this subwoofer if u hook it up correctly its loud trust me
5,Great sounds like a a threater
5,Added to my Yamaha receiver and wow what a difference. My receiver is 100 watts per channel and has sub-woofer out. While watching stones on tv I cranked it up and it sounded like we were there in concert! My brother said he was so jealous. Also very flexible with attachment methods works even if you don't have a sub out.
5,I replaced my sony sub great upgrade
5,It's a piece of solid equipment.
5,I purchased this subwoofer to supplement my older Bose speaker system. The subwoofer added the needed bass the system was lacking.  I can now hear the bass thumping  throughout the house !  Best way to add a new dimension in sound to any speaker system.  A best buy !
5,Compared to entry level off brands at a lower price point I'd recommended spending a little more money to buy the PSW10.
5,For less that a hundred bucks this thing rocks! Read the install instructions if you are using the LFE input. It says to plug it into either L or R input and then turn the low pass all the way CW (I think). The instructions spell it out! Not shielded so keep it away from any old TV's although I doubt there are many left on the planet...
5,I had been looking for a subwoofer for quite some time but my receiver did not have a sub output.  The pass through connection on this one made my hook up easy without degrading the sound quality of my main speakers. It is a big box and hard to hide but you can put it anywhere and the sound gets out without any problem.  Having its own volume control is a plus. You can crank it up for action movies or tone it down for easy listening.I recommend this to anyone with an older sound system that needs an upgrade to add some oomph.
3,A good value for a cheap sub. This would work well in a smaller room but disappointing for me. I started with one of these and a pair of bookshelf speakers. I quickly noticed that the sub was under powered and distorted when listening to music cranked up or during explosions in movies. I bough a 2nd one to help and it did but I'm still disappointed and I'll be upgrading sometime soon.
4,polk is quality.i liked the price.really wakes things up.very happy.
5,I bought one at first just to see how they are he ended up buying three more for my home theater they sound great best bang for your buck
4,I was replacing my old Polk subwoofer and was shocked at the prices out there in the stores.  I found this product on Amazon for $99 which was what I paid for my original Polk subwoofer 10 years ago.  It takes some tweaking to get the sound set up correctly with the back knobs but once set I can't complain.  Great booming bass which is what I like to listen to Phil Lesch throwing out bass lines with the Grateful Dead.  Follow directions on setting up the sound.
4,This is a good entry level sub. Does it compare to SVS or other top name subs.....Absolutely not. For the price it is a very capable sub as long as it is not pushed beyond its limits.
5,First of all I do not describe myself as an audiophile but I know good sounds and crap when I hear it. This is an excellent subwoofer all you would ever need unless you live in an auditorium or you really want to piss-off your neighbors. My den is 28X16 and this subwoofer fills it with room to spare no need to to turn it up to '11'. The auto power works flawlessly I've seen some comments about it not working properly. There is a 1 to 3 second lag on initial start up.
5,Adds punch to my theatre surround system. The adjustments are nice.  I love this sub so much I bought a second one for the bedroom. Excellent price.
5,Easy setup.
5,Good product for the price.  Front firing port a plus.  Great for smaller rooms / bedroom systems.
4,The bass quality is great especially for the price! The only problem I had was with the Auto-On feature. For whatever reason the sub would rarely turn on. I've heard this can be a problem depending on the tuner you're using. It's fine because I just leave it On all the time and it doesn't use much power when it's not receiving a signal but I did deduct 1 star for a feature that doesn't work as advertised.
5,It's actually a simple sound system with stereo outputs on the back.  It's not what I really needed but I made it work as a subwoofer by just connecting the subwoofer speaker to one of the channels.  Learn from my mistake but I still like how it sounds for what it does.
5,Easy to set up and listen to. Adds the right amount of base to my sound bar.
5,Works great and sounds awesome!!
5,If you are looking at this u need more bass in your system so here it goes... 10" subs is where the serious bass starts( the V8 of speakers) and this one will NOT dissapoint. It provides accurate deep bass and at this price range you cant go wrong. I have a dvd/surround system and this replaced the 6"sub it came with. There is no comparison between the 2.
5,Very impressed for the size and cost!
4,I paired the subwoofer to a pair of Baby Advent speakers and a Denon receiver. I ran the speakers thru the subwoofer to reduce the low end to the Advents. The sound is very good and just right for my room. I have the subwoofer turned down to about a third of it's output. Otherwise it would put out too much rumble to the room. I think this subwoofer could fill a lot bigger room with sound and would work good for both music and movies. It would work really good for gaming.
5,This Polk PSW10 is the gold standard for a $100 powered subwoofer.It's well built has a nice solid look and sounds great!It goes down to 35Hz but with 50 watts RMS power it won't rattle the walls or keep up with big tower speakers.Where this sub really shines is in a small to medium sized room matched with bookshelf speakers.I've been using the PSW10 for over three years playing movies and music and it's still going strong and looking good:
5,This subwoofer really puts out the sound.  I had it's volume control a bit too high when I first tried it out & nearly blew out my windows!!  It was easy to tune down to where I wanted it for my surround system though.  Excellent quality & awesome price!
5,I was told Polk audio was good by a friend...  I built my family a home theater room / game room.  I had a tight budget to follow.  I found this sub for $78 on Amazon with free shipping.  I was skeptical...  When it came I was shocked by just the quality of the sub.  Excellent workmanship.  After I hooked it up and we watched the first movie we all looked at each other and my wife made me show her the receipt...  She could not believe I paid so little for such good quality and sound and with free shipping.  And frankly neither can I..  Highly recommend.
5,For the price it’s great. It performs great.
5,I ordered this Subs and i have no regrets the sound quality is great. i would surely recommend this
3,This sub woofer did not work at all with my Bose sound bar as the ads suggest.  Apparently is was not compatible.Had to return it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            POWERFUL SUB for $77 bucks now its $115.. Love it for TV and music..of course BAYCE JAMZ. Love the crossover pass features which is a MUST have for high dB listening.Hear it for yourselves on 8dB while jamming on my 4k UHD Samsung TV> Sound Cloud> Artist is G JONES~ Song is LOW END THEORY for bass testing :-)
4,very nice. sounds greatdownside.. requires OLD STYLE RCA connection for sub. could not find local ordered from amazon. 1 into 2 RCAi ordered 2 wish i had gotten the cherry color
5,Love it so much that I bought a replacement when my doodle ate the first one. Then I found and bought just the sub on eBay. Now we have two! Watching a movie and listening to Future will never be the same
4,For the price I don't think you can do much better. Easy to hook up with your system and hear those bass notes again. A huge improvement in the sound quality production of music and movies.
5,Great piece
5,If you're looking for a decent and powerful Subwoofer come no further. This product have outstanding bass that fits perfectly with any movie night. It has a natural design to fit any room and is made with quality parts with soft rubber feet to protect your floors. So far i haven't had any problems yet and hopefully I won't in the feature. I hope this review will help you
2,Another victim of the humming/buzzing power supply problem that others have complained about.  To be very clear this is not some ground loop problem in the amp from bad cables or whatever this is the cheap power supplies in these things.  With NOTHING connected the power supply in the back hums.  The longer it is powered on the louder it gets.  It's a real shame because the sub does produce some decent bass.  Unfortunately the hum from the power supply was too annoying in quiet movie or music moments.  Because I am not the only one who has had this happen I wasn't willing to try a second unit and am going with another brand now.  Way to blow it Polk.
4,This was a good buy for the amount of cash it cost...good sturdy solid bass...
5,I needed a subwoofer to accompany my set of Infinity Entra speakers and my Denon AVR-1312.  This works perfectly.  The price was very reasonable.  As for performance the adjustable volume control and frequency range makes it easy to manage.  I wish it had a main power switch but like most modern day electronics it stays in stand by unless you unplug the power cord.  I only use it for music and unplug for TV and movie viewing because my Infinity Entra floor standing speakers have sufficient low end capabilities.5 stars for this Polk subwoofer.  It has way more bass than I need....but may come in handy if I get annoying neighbors one day.
5,This sub has all the ummph I need for my system. It produces some amazing lows without any distortion. The cabinet is great quality as is expected from Polk and is heavy for its size. Weight is a big plus because when we watch movies I don't have to worry about vibrating all over the room. The front fire speaker works better than the down fire in my opinion. This sub is versatile with adjustments and connection options in the back. I love my music and movies loud and this sub delivers everything I need. For under a 100 bucks it's a steal.
5,At $92 this was the best value-to-cost benefit I've seen on near-audiophile quality 10-inch powered sub-woofer. I consider this an excellent buy even if you see the price tag between $99 and $110 the range of which I've often seen this in. Well-built in Malaysia. The metallic front template the speaker is attached to gives the box the impression of functional solidity and visual class. The rear has a good array of control knobs flips and switches. Has a thoughtful set of feet to keep the box above ground helping to improve the bass sound effect especially in a small room. Would buy this again hands down.
4,though it doesn't have a sub input just reg rca's  it still packs a punch nicely defined & PLENTY loud for a living room.  Using it with DefTech surround setup to replace a $500. sub... super value.
4,Best 10" sub woofer for the price I ever heard
5,Okay so we made our basement into a home theatre. My sound guy recommended this subwoofer to us but in a 12”. This is a 10” subwoofer and this thing kicks! My whole basement shakes when we have an action movie on. Great sound quality and not too big. Love it!
5,Real good sound for the price
5,I have purchased Polk Audio product for twenty years The PSW 10 is a great sub for the price. You can't buy anything close to this value anywhere for the price that Amazon sells this product. I connected this to my Polk audio floor speakers and it's the perfect enhancement for my system. Thank you Amazon.
5,I bought an entire 5.1 Polk setup along with a Yamaha RX-V671 amp and it is amazing. The speakers are clear and loud when I want imaging is very good and the build quality is outstanding. These look great among my other furniture. I balanced my setup for music with two towers in front (Monitor 70 AM7025-B) Monitor CS1 speaker for center two wall mounted bookshelf speakers for rears (Monitor 30 AM3025-A) and this PSW10 Subwoofer right behind the couch. Movies are amazing though this setup every explosion rumbles the house like you are there. my dog thinks it's a thunderstorm sometimes. 5.1 music is incredibly clear  and open I couldn't be happier with these speakers.
5,Great sound at a affordable price
5,I have more than one of these and when I got the 2nd one it did not sound as good as the 1st one I have had for 6 months.  after about a week of use the 2nd newer one began to sound better.  Point is it seems there is a breakin period.
5,This sub is an excellent value. It's not super powerful but great sound for the dollar!
5,This is a well performing good sounding good looking sub for a really low price (I bought it on special).I'm really happy with how easily it set up and how good it sounds in my bedroom surround system.
5,I saw all the reviews and I immediately wanted it. When it wasn’t home I thought it was defective and debated returning it. I adjusted the settings in my receiver and realized that my sub was 8+ which would definitely change the sound. I fixed it and it sound amazing.
5,Wub wub sub sub.10 10 would buy againSeriously though it's very nice and get's down to about 25~ hz around 20 hz it's just movement(Which is true for all subwoofers anyway as that frequency isn't heard really by human ears)Depending on your setup you'd have to decide what frequency it would respond to(I have mine just below 80 hz but my monitors produce around that so it works for me.Overall very happy with this subwoofer and I'd recommend it to others as a fairly high quality sub.
5,Being a mid-higher end subwoofer owner I was curious what a $100 subwoofer with so many positive reviews would sound like so I ordered it.  I am fairly impressed with the output and think it's worth the money.  Much better than the Pioneer Klipsh and Mirage subwoofers I've also owned.  Good job Polk.
5,I added this speaker to my hobby room which has two smaller Bose speakers. This woofer added the base the room needed. Excellent!
2,From all of the reviews i read i thought this was going to be a great budget sub. Maybe I'm not the average reviewer because i used to be heavily into car audio and have listened to many great subwoofers before but this Polk is really not worth the money. At lower volume it makes it's presence known but anything past half volume it's totally gutless.You can hear the mechanical movement of the subwoofer over the actual bass it's putting out and since this sub is right underneath my desktop it's incredibly annoying. Keep the grill on the box because the sub is really ugly. The rubber surround is extremely cheap something you'd see in a factory speaker more Styrofoam than rubber.All in all i would really not recommend this for anyone that really enjoys bass and knows what they like. If you just want something to fill in the bottom end and dont have much to spend and you dont really listen to anything very loudly then this is the sub for you.
5,Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer (Single Black)        Hip Hop listeners typically have calloused ear drums and can no longer discern deep bass from the rattles created by their car body separated welds.For the ultimate bass listening experience I would suggest buying a pawn shop bass drum cut a hole in bottom of drumhead large enough to comfortably insert head (small  pillow is comfortable). Then put garage sale subwoofer on other side of drum... remove hearing aids and crank it up to achieve nervana and annoy dogs for several blocks.... Oh Yes... the Polk PSW10 sub is adequate to enhance both music and movies without sticking your head in a bass drum.
5,But this works great. Easy to hook up and adjust. Really adds a lot to my tv system.  Great price. Highly recommend.
5,not an expensive piece but as with all Polk Audio pieces it works better than expected
5,I use this sub to compliment my Edifier R1850DBs and the sound is absolutely amazing!!!  The sub looks so sharp and sound absolutely incredible.  Extremely powerful!
4,Love the quality of music but not the construction. At the bottom of the subwoofer there are these legs as in the picture they break after a year and if you don't watch it as the subwoofer moves with hwavy bass they will acatch the floor
5,excellent addition to my 5 speaker boston acoustic surround. I use a Sony 7 channel receiver and this thing sounds great.Im not looking to knock my house down but it really fills in the lows just how i wanted for my man cave.  The auto on/off function is great also.
3,Package arrived in good condition and overall looks were good. The sound quality is poor at higher volumes. The speaker crackles under higher volumes. This speaker may work better for movie watching but I wouldn't recommend this for music with heavy bass. Just my two cents!
5,I'm amazed at all the intricate bass undertones that just go completely unnoticed without a good subwoofer.  I listened to the TV and my records and kept on turning the volume up and down on my subwoofer to compare the depth of sound before and after adding deep bass.I love it after awhile it just blends perfectly with the audio so the sound is very natural.  Also this sucker gets very loud.  There will never be a reason for me to turn it up past 3/4 volume but just the same I'm glad I can :-)For the price you cannot beat this subwoofer.  Buy it before the price goes back up!
5,nice bass for the priceover a year later and daily use this sub still performs as it did when new.99.99 is cheap and being my first home audio sub I can't compare it to anything else except car audio.There are obviously higher quality subs but I've always had subs in my cars and this one produces more than enough bass.Where you position it also plays a large factor in how the bass sounds and feels
5,I already had a sub and this one now makes too. This polk 10" sub really made my system sound great. The bass is soft when it needs to be and can rattle my windows when you want the bass to hit like it sould in a movie. Thanks polk audio.
5,Damn!!  Nice bass for a great price.  I had to turn that volume down on it by half it's so powerful.  Great addition to my system.  In thank you but my neighbors dont.
5,Just what I needed to add bass to my Zvox sound bar and Sony Bravia TV.  Bass is perfect for music channels and movies.
5,Great deal for the money.
5,Thumbs up
5,I bought this then I saw the klipsch k-100sw was on sale for 140 so I bought the klipsch and plan to return this. After watching movie with both the Polk actually sounds better as it blends better with the speaker sound. The klipsch is really loud and is better for music but the Polk is here to stay.
5,This unit is really fantastic quality for the price.  Using as main living room sub.  Very happy with this purchase.
3,I purchased this to replace a 200W JBL subwoofer that blew a day before I was supposed to host movie night at my place.  Amazon Prime came to the rescue and delivered a sub to my door in less than 24 hours for less than $100.  Does it work okay? Yes.  Is it great?  Not really it's fairly week in comparison to my last sub but it's enough to add fill to an action movie.  My theater is in a 14' x 16' room and this guy has a hard time keeping up.
5,Really simple hook up no problem
5,I got this thing to go with my bookshelf Polk Audio speakers and a Bluetooth amp. It thumps and sounds great. You can also adjust how much bass you want.
5,If you are an audiophile move along. If you are looking for a GREAT sub to add that missing element to your under $400 surround sound system or speaker bar then this is the thumper for you! It kicks clear and smooth for music and rumbles rough and nasty (in a good way) for explosions in movies and video games. For sub $100 (pun) this is a great buy!Edit* 10 months later I'm now in a house not an apartment. This still provides the right amount of bass even with a larger room. Now I have it on large 18X18 tile so I'm not sure if that changes the acoustics at all. I'd buy it again.
2,I agree with the minority of reviewers here who find it too rumbly and boomy and not nearly tight and musical enough. It's fine if all you need is a device to shake the floor when watching Iron Man II on TV. For that purpose it worked fine for me. But if you want to listen to music well...I was able to adjust the crossover and volume to make it sound acceptable for classical cello music -- to add some warmth depth and resonance. It was actually quite nice for that. But for pop rock dance etc the way music is equalized it simply demands more from a woofer than this is capable of providing. I had to turn the dials way down to keep it from muddying the sound completely. In the end I just unplugged it for those types of music. If all you do is watch TV then fine it's a bargain and enjoy it. But if you listen critically and you don't want to have to fine-tune your subwoofer for each album then move on save your money up for something better. And let me know what you buy because I will want one too.Now my dilemma is: it was so cheap it's hardly worth the cost of returning. But it's not really what I want despite all the glowing reviews here that convinced me to buy it. Don't blindly trust reviewers here when it comes to high-end audio. Probably the folks with the true golden ears don't shop here much.
5,Other reviews mention that this is not a subwoofer for music.  If you understand that at the time of purchase then this is a great buy!I added this to my theater room where the boys watch movies and play the PS4.  This has all the booms for explosions and action movies.  I am no acoustic engineer but I can hear where the range is lacking in some musical selections.
5,This is a well built piece of gear. It is larger than expected with about a 14" by 15" footprint and 14" tall. I used the wired inputs between the amplifier and sub-woofer since the amplifier did not output from RCA jacks. It is overkill for our home since we won't normally need the volume above 20%. Considering the quality vs price it seems an excellent bargain.
5,I purchased the Sonos Amp with a pair of Sony towers sound was pretty good but needed more low frequency bass . . these did the trick . . .
4,Sounds good accurate for most movies and music. Lots of bass for a 10 but on some movies notice it can get slightly muddy sounding think has to do with output of the sub not being completely linear. Still great sub for the money.
5,Great subwoofer.  I purchased this one to replace my subwoofer that was ruined during a basement flood.  The price was low enough for me but I don't feel like I lost any performance.  It has a nice deep rich sound.  The worst part was getting my receiver to acknowledge it was there and actually send sound to it but after that fact it was a breeze to finish setting up.
5,This is a really nice sub but you have to allow a few days of use to really appreciate it. When I first started using it the sub just didn't seem very loud compared to my old sub that blew out. After using it for a few days and getting broken in the volume is great. I actually need to turn the volume on the sub down. It is rattling the doors on my closet.
5,Physical size and performance is perfect for my family room (20x27). The speaker adds the needed dimension of bass without being boomy or overpowering the other speakers. I adjusted my speakers using the directions and microphone that came with my Denon receiver.  The speaker was extremely simple to connect. Though is has two inputs only one is needed since bass is non (or omni) directional. Once connected and plugged in you won't know it's there until it's time to perform. Great buy for the price-point offering top drawer performance.
4,Not being an audiophile I selected this by reading reviews and comparing prices.  Putting this on a 5.1 channel system with other Polk Audio speakers and driven by an Onkyo receiver I get excellent sound for my Home Theater as well as music.  As a moderately priced item I am extremely happy with the bass output as its expands the drama in those movies I love to watch.
5,Going from my Yamahas sub that was six inches to the Polk 10 was a game changer for my home theater now Dolby d is what it should be
5,I'm using it along with a 12 inch. They're placed in different areas within the family room the sound is awesome.  It gives the room more volume.
5,This is an absolute perfect subwoofer for my apartment. Sound quality is great and the ability to control its output is what I needed. I would recommend this subwoofer to anyone with a smaller area. Thank you Polk Audio!
2,Subwoofer performs decently up to about 45%volume but if you turn it up past there you are met with horrid port noise which overpowers the sound of the subwoofer as well as the other speakers. There is a cheap flimsy cross hair shaped grill on the inside of the port which I would expect contributes to the port noise. I used mine for music before returning it. If you plan on blending sound or just filling in the void below 80hz ( to about 45hz as this is a low powered 10 inch sub) this sub should do fine for you. But if you want to "feel" the bass or have it turned up at all look elsewhere. I plan on ordering the PSW 505 12 inch or the Bic America f12 12 inch... Hopefully whichever I end up ordering is better.EDIT: Bought the PSW 505 on amazon ($199) and so far i am satisfied with it. Much more powerful. I will give it a week or so before i produce my final verdict.
5,A lot of boom for your buck. I wanted to add some bass to my office desk setup. I have a T-amp powering two Pioneer sp-bs22-lr's but I wanted more depth to my music. The great thing about this is that I can run a 2.1 setup through my $20 t-amp. I ran my speaker cables from my amp the the speaker in on the woofer then ran lines from the out to the two speakers. For about $150 (everything on sale) you can put together an incredible small/medium room system. Double check the dimensions this thing is not small.
5,I bought this to go with my surround sound system. My Sony surround amp like most surround amps doesn't have the capability of powering a subwoofer speaker. Getting a powered subwoofer speaker is a cost-effective answer to the problem and this one can shake the house when listening to a movie with a lot of low frequency effects (LFE channel designated by .1).It also provides a lot of "bottom" when listening to music.It takes a little time to learn the controls on this unit. It can be set to turn on automatically when it senses an LFE signal. It has volume level adjustable crossover and a phase swtich too.
5,If you want to bring the boom then this is what you want. Great bass for only a single 10" woofer. It literally rattles the windows and move the pictures in my apartment at only 1/2 volume. I have yet to even turn it up all the way. But be warned it is all bass. There is absolutely zero treble coming out of this thing. You can't even hear the words people are saying in songs. Using it to supplement your home theater is awesome. Using it as your only speaker would be a bad idea.
1,I have had this sub for roughly a month or so and I am not a fan of it at all. Save the $100 and spend it on a better subwoofer. Even with having it set as low as I do (-4 on the receiver sub @ 1/2 for the gain and 0 on lpf) it still wants to bottom out more frequent than not. Forget listening to music with deep bass or watching any type of movie. Not to mention the feet fell off within the first few seconds of pulling it out of the box.Update: we have had this subwoofer for exactly 3 months today.. and today is the day that it decided to stop working. No we don't beat the living crap out of it either. I attempted to turn some cartoons on for our daughter earlier today while doing so I hit the power button for the surround sound receiver for the living room; (we have 2 receivers set up 1: is for the living area 2: is wired to provide sound through out the main story of the home) and I got no response from the subwoofer (it is set to auto so whenever the receiver is on the subwoofer is on) I unplugged it waited 5 mins or so plugged it back in and still nothing. I should have sent it back when I first got it.. 😒😒😒
5,I’m very happy with this subwoofer. Great sound for an affordable price.
5,Great sub for price!!! Deep bass!!!! Cant pass up
5,Nice size looks great Sounds great couldn't be happier
5,Fills in the very lowest frequencies my speskers couldn't play.  You can set the upper frequency you want it to stop at;  I set it at the lowest frequency because my speakers already went pretty low.On YouTube there's a speaker test that plays all frequencies so you know how low your speakers go.
4,I work in Audio/video and have this sub in my living room paired with Polk speakers. They sound great for their price range. Highly recommend Polk products if you care about Audio quality
5,Shakes my house and pisses off my duplex neighbors (i'm sure)...... I highly recommend this dude!
5,Sounds great
5,As always the shipping and Amazon updates were great. Likewise this is great. It's exactly as described in the product description and does what it's intended to do. I have no complaints and would definitely recommend to others.
5,Deep theater quality subwoofer! There is definitely some research needed per receiver to make sure your getting the right signal such as LFE and the right cross over.
5,Bigger than expected but sounds great and looks good!
5,This is a true bargain.  Everybody seems to have jacked up their price on subwoofers recently. so the price is great.  The construction is robust and the adjustments seem to be spot on out of the box.  Just plug in the power and the sub out from the receiver​ and Bob' your uncle.The available power is more than adequate to fill my slightly larger than average apartment living room - the walls and the floor quiver.
5,Excellent sounding sub
4,For the money a good deal but not as nice as what it replaced which was larger and had a more present bass. I guess I'm old school but these new sound systems with tiny satellite speakers just don't hold up to the old giant speakers that had much better quality sound and could really give you the volume without loss of quality.
5,This thing will shake your house with no problem at all and I live in a fairly large place my friend complained that it was very weak and didn't deliver much power at all however he was using a 200w receiver I was using a 1000w receiver. Because it is a powered subwoofer I didn't expect that to make a difference but for some reason it does. Maybe the signal strength was much weaker on his receiver or something but either way its a pretty awesome sub and you can NOT beat the price.
4,Bought to replace my older PS10 that had a board problem. It was cheaper to buy a new one that it was to repair. Hope this one lasts longer.
5,Sounds strong
5,needed this for use with book shelf speakers
5,Gotta love the floor thumping base fantastic quality
4,Sounds clear & hits hard. Perfect for my home studio...
5,Bass!  This sub is used in my game room with 4 bookshelf speakers.  We listen to music from a turntable and from our phones using a Denon receiver.  The bookshelf speakers sounded great on their own but when I added this sub it introduce the lows that were missing.  It made a big difference is all genres of music!
5,now that's rumble ...
5,We LOVE this subwoofer speaker. We have it hooked up to our TV system and our turntable through an Onyx receiver. It looks nice and sounds great. We have a large loft style home and we can hear it well in all areas of the house. This was a great purchase!
5,First I wanna start out by saying that the product was delivered fast and arrived in great conditions. When I opened the Polk Audio speaker I was amazed at the quality of this product. This product was setup in my living room (300-400sqft) and the bass was amazing. If the volume in turned up all the way my windows start to rattle. This was a great addition to my home theater system. I LOVE IT.
5,I bought some very expensive bookshelf speakers and was disappointed in the lack of "bottom end" After buying the Polk sub-woofer and dialing it in I have everything I had hoped for. Tight bass reaching into the midrange slightly. I thought I was going to have to buy a more expensive sub-woofer somewhere down the road but this fits the bill perfectly. I am very pleasantly surprised.
5,Great product! Great Sound! Great Price! You did it again amazon! Keep selling 5 star items and I'll keep buying.!
5,I bought this after my KEF subwoofer clitched out and also after I did alot of research.  I knew before I bought it that it wasn't going have the same "boom" as the KEF but I was looking for a good value sub for my surround sound.  This fits the bill!!!  Good tight sound for a small to medium size room.  Definitely work on the position and settings of the Polk Sub and your Receiver.  I am sure there is not another Sub in this price range with this quality.  I'm glad I pick this one.  Oh....I ordered it on the weekend and received one day later.....Amazon is awesome!
5,Great bass volume and sound for the price!
5,This subwoofer is awesome! I never thought it would sound so good especially when I played a movie! This thing raddles the floor! This is very similar sounding to my Logitech Z-2300 PC speakers. I am running a 35foot subwoofer cable from the 630watt Sony Receiver all the way around my bow window to the back of the living room. From there I have a Y cable that converts the subwoofer cable into left right RCA cables. I put the subwoofer underneath the lamp stand facing the woofer toward the couch. Works great with music to would recommend this to EVERYONE! Thanks Polk Audio and Amazon once again for your great service and 3-5 years warranty.
4,To start off this Polk sub looks great! As far as bass goes it will easily fill a smaller sized room like mine! As far as clarity goes it's below average. From afar the bass sounds good but the closer you are to the sub the bass becomes muddy and muffled. The bass from my Bose bluetooth speaker is more rich and clear so that is why I am deducting one star from the product.
5,Very clean responsive deep bass
4,It will add some bass. Does a good job.
5,You like candy shop cuz I like candy shop before Da club...buy this subwoofer and time to wake the neighbors...great sound.. great price...buy it already!
5,I read on another website that recommended this sub to be paired with AudioEngine A2+ speakers I bought for my computer to give my system some added bass and it didn't disappoint!!Setup way very quick and simple and before long I had everything set up and had to turn it down because things were rattling off my walls!  I have this in a relatively small bedroom turned office and the bass levels are very impressive!!
5,Getting my home theater setup Frankenstein style one or two pieces at a time and this being my first home theater subwoofer i'm impressed for just how good it sounds and how easy it was to setup my receiver is 5.2 and I plan on buying another subwoofer in the future
5,Thank you - great easy to use subwoofer after we blew out our last one.  Super fast shipping too.
4,Good subwoofer for the money.  I happened to get this on sale for $79.99.  I will say it sounds good but some songs even at medium volumes makes the sub shake so hard it hits the grille causing a vibration sound.  I have a 11x25 living room and it is plenty loud.  For a starter system or someone on a budget this is a terrific subwoofer.  Personally for me next time i will go with a better one such as Klipsch or Velodyne.
5,Ten years ago i purchased a polk audio psw 350 for my home theater system i paid around 350 for it over the years of abuse it finally died it was a sad day...was doing some research on subwoofers trying to figure out which ones were going to be comparable to what i had i completly based my decision on reviews I just received my psw10 and it puts the psw350 to shame its in a 480 square foot garage connected to 7.1 all bose ive never been so impressed with a subwoofer of this value great sub! great price! over exceeded my expectations!!
5,I upgraded my old Sony 8” subwoofer that came with a Surround sound system that’s about 17 years old. What an improvement! Handles the lower frequencies that the other one couldn’t touch. Highly recommended.
5,Wow! After years without a nice audio system I finally went out and picked up a modern recever and hooked up my old Polk bookshelf speakers. But the base just wasn't there. After looking at an audio store I searched Amazon.  This product is awesome and cost less than 1/3 what the store wanted! Quick installation and now our auditory experience is outstanding while watching movies and listening to CDs LPs Pandora etc.
3,10” subwoofers just don’t dig as deep as a 12” and worse yet they typically lack the power of a 12” subwoofer. This one sounded flabby and weak compared to the 12” Polk model i’ve owned for years and have been happy with. I would only suggest this for low volume listening like if you live in an apartment.
4,Music is what I'm using this Sub for and it certainly gets the job done. I have it paired with Polk floor standing speakers. For the money you can't go wrong here. I can't speak to how they would do in a surround set up as I'm not purposing them for that.
5,I bought the PSW10 two months ago.  It is a great value and it delivers exactly the sound I was looking for.  The adjustable low pass filter and the volume control enabled me to set it up for the room and it sounds great.  The only thing I added was an 8 ft. $10 Mediabridge Ultra Series RCA Y-Adapter cable (1-male to 2-male) which made it a plug-and-play affair.  I am very pleased with it and would purchase this subwoofer again in a heartbeat.
5,Using as part of a home theater system whose old woofer finally bit the dust.  Easy set up and great bass with lots of adjustment.  Lots of the magazines I read say you can't find anything much better for under $400
5,Excellent sub. I already own one of these and added this one to give me dual subs for bass that is grounds for divorce. This is an excellent product.
5,I'm writing this review based on the reviews I've read on here. I pulled the triggered and got one. WOW is all I can say for the size of this sub its not big but for the size it output the dept of a larger subs out there. Actually I had to turn it down as I was feeling it in my chest when doing a bass test. Looks great and sounds great and tt goes along with my other Polkies speakers (2 Monitor70 front CSI3 Center 2Monitor60 surround sound). I would highly recommand this for anyone having doubts about this sub. ITs great makes you want to kick yourself for not getting this sooner.
4,excellent sound quality for the price
5,In addition to works as advertised it also has multiple hook-up options.  Sounds great.
5,If you want to fill the room with depth and lows at a good price buy now.  This unit works well with my Pioneer receiver and brings the bass capably whether the receiver is set to radio t.v. or computer. The cabinet looks good. Very satisfied so far.
5,I ordered this two days later it arrived and sadly I had only to wait for my stereo 3 days later. However the moment I set it up it was pushing bass  like a champion and was destroying all sounds I put in it's path. It is truly amazing I love the sound quality it makes my  floors vibrate on the floor above and if you touch the wall you can feel the vibrations there too. It is an amazing subwoofer and it is $90 less than what one would pay at Best Buy so make sure to order this sub it produces some of the best sound I have ever heard.
5,I love this Polk sub!! Almost too much bass for an apartment.. My neighbors will not mind.. I am sure!!!
5,I love this subwoofer. Been using it for almost two years. For the size and the price this thing is unbeatable.If you're looking for great bass quality in a small size for a really good price I can't recommend this enough.
5,I've owned this for two years now and I love listening to the low deep bass this sub can produce. Works just like when I first bought it. No problems. I use this in a 2.1 setup with Pioneer bookshelf speakers and a Sony 2.0 stereo system. The best part of this sub is that it has the connections on the back to turn your 2.0 setup into a 2.1 setup. Even better if you don't need the sub to be on you can unplug it and it'll still allow passthrough of sound to the bookshelf speakers from the stereo receiver.
5,This is a really nice sub.  Pairs so well with my other Polk speakers.  Incredibly loud if you dial it up.  Will shake the heck out of you and your neighbors.
5,OMG. Bought 2 of these for my soundsystem. Good movies to test these on are (1) Ready Player One (2) Lord of the Rings (3) Any Star Wars (4) Jurassic Park <any of them> (5) Saving Private Ryan. Just rocks and I cant stop raving about them. Have had them for 6 months now and still rocking.
5,Superb Sound Quality.
5,What can I say it shook the walls so much it took my RA 6 weeks to find me because they were searching the wrong floor of my dorm! Wish the low pass filter sent the high pass signal for my regular speakers
5,Buy it u will be happy
5,Needed a good budget sub to complete my sound system and this one did not disappoint! The price was amazing and the sound quality is great in my setup. The manual clearly laid out how to use and set it up and toggle all the appropriate settings. I am very pleased.
5,pretty awesome little sub. but i will say this as was advised to me give it time to break in. do not crank the base up keep it no more than half way. it seriously took almost 4-6 weeks before it broke in one day i just noticed it was booming ALOT more than it was previously. my 12inch sony powered sub was much louder at first but now they are equal at worst and might even be better. ( i have a 7.2 so i have 2 powered subs in my set up)
5,Polk is always on top of their game and this 10 incher will not disappoint. The key is knowing the proper placement and tuning based on the location and room acoustics. Excellent customer support is one of the reasons I've been a Polk customer since I first got a pair of their SDA-2's a while back.
4,The port noise is very apparent when playing songs with very low frequencies at high volumes. I had to stuff a pair of thick socks into the port but now it sounds like a dream.
4,I have a denon reciver with pollks audio in wall speakers and center as well pollks rear speakers.Before this San I had an Harman Larson which stopped working I can tell that it worked much better than this one but hey for a $100 I couldn't expected more.Overall I'm happy with this purchase and the price I paid for it.
5,So far so good - works well with my existing surround system and was fairy easy to set up and connect to my AV Receiver
5,I like the size and most of all the sound is very rich and has a very deep bass. I use it with my home theater system.
4,There is a little distortion on the deep/loud bass hits but overall this a good value for the money. It has lasted for a few years with no hiccups so far.
5,I bought a pair of Bose speakers for my PC and I was quite disappointed with the bass (clarity was awesome).  I added this sub to my pair of Bose speakers and my PC now has awesome sound quality for music games and movies.
2,I'm actually astonished at how bad this sub sounded. I've owned many Polk products over the years and this was to be paired with a set of 600 towers to replace an Onkyo sub that was doing it's job but didn't have auto-on which was a feature I wanted. I figured after the glowing reviews and decent price I couldn't go wrong. Well here's me surprised and returning the sub. It's heavy it looks great it's got the features I want but after messing with it for a few days I simply cannot make it sound anything but punchy and awful in my setup. The bass is honky sounding the lowest frequencies just shelve off abruptly and it's very directional sounding in my room (something no other sub I've used has had an issue with). Quite frankly it sounds like something from a cheap computer speaker setup. Disappointed but I'll stick with the Onkyo which sounds fantastic.
5,A marriage  made in heaven these woofer  pairs up nicely  with the Edifier R1850DB
5,Easy to set up with my Yamaha TSR-7850. I know nothing about home theatre systems but this was plug and play and it shakes the walls.
4,👌🏽
5,Effortless set-up and great price!
4,I paired two of these with my Klipsch Bookshelf speaks and my Onkyo towers.They absolutely bring it all to life....and my neighbors hate me.I strongly recommend the Polk 10” Sub.
5,Nice Deep Bass.Excellent
5,This worked great. Put speaker behind us behind the couch.  Had to spend some time getting volume level set right.  It comes on automatically and then goes off automatically.  The sound quality is good.  Very pleased.  Be sure to follow instructions on how to set up it for line level input vs. speaker output level.
5,Works perfect
5,Just fine for a lower priced unit
5,THE SUB-WOOFERS WORK GREAT!
4,This was part of my home stereo upgrade. If you compare it to the Energy 5.1 (http://www.amazon.com/Energy-RC-Micro-Surround-Speaker-System/dp/B001RQ2CXO/ref=sr_1_2?s=aht&ie=UTF8&qid=1359430788&sr=1-2&keywords=home+speakers) and you price out the polk system (4 owm3 and psw10)  you can see you get much better value for your money.while this is a decent sub (especially when you consider price) dont expect a ton of thump. Its enough to better a stereo without a sub but if you want to really feel the bass youre going to have to spend a LOT more.
5,set up the psw10 took about an hour still tweaking it in  so far I love it  made my klipsch  r5m speakers sound like a different set of speakers  love the way it takes over the lower freq. and lets my klipsch handle the mid and highs 150% improvement in sound quality. just read the set up instructions  and you will find out what you have been missing with a set of 2 way speakers
5,Excellent bass especially for 10 inch definitely makes you know it's there. Well worth  the price
5,price for quality
5,Polk has been a major player in quality sound reproduction for many years and the PSW10 is no exception. While much smaller than many subwoofers it has a very big voice. The bass is smooth and clean and once appropriately adjusted it provides just the right amount of support for the Polk Monitor 40 speakers I use with this sub for my theatre sound system. It's only required to fill a room that is 15'X22' with 10' ceilings.  For a much larger room you would probably be better off with one of the larger Polk subs.The initial review is still valid but now I am experiencing some intermittent 60cycle hum.
5,Great bass just what I needed to get the bass I was seeking for my sound system
5,At $100 this subwoofer is a great value. The box is very well made although the decorative speaker grill is a mite flimsy.Added this to a 200w mini Bluetooth amp a couple of old Bose Acoustimass 5 Series II speakers I wasn't using and voila' instant stereo system for under $200.
4,nice big size means everything weight 26lbs and sounds great with my pioneer 830k and two from mains two surrounds with 2 12' in each speaker and a mica center rocks! 700w thanks for a real wood sub they dont make them like this any more 2006 almost old school but in a good way..
5,This was a Christmas present to my husband and he loves it  this was the first time he was happy with his gift 🤷‍♀️Sounds great looks great
5,I ordered this sub to fill out the low end of a stereo that I was putting together in a smaller den WOW this was everything I was looking for and more. It blended perfectly with a set of polk T-15 monitors that were purchased earlier. these worked so well that I just ordered a second polk psw10 to provide bass in a larger system that I use as a HT set-up in another room. Delivery was fast and my sub arrived in great shape. Thanks Amazon for offering a great product and fast shipping. Will definitely be using Polk and Amazon for my future audio needs !  Hillary C.  Chester S.C.
5,This is my first and most rich sounding sub I have experienced. After making adjustments placement and right volume this thing can really rumble and shake medicine cabinets if need be. But also be subtle yet powerful in movies and videos games and really immerses you into the experience.
5,This little sub holds it own and fills my home with bass. It's not a powerhouse but it does a good job delivering smooth clean bass. I have it paired with 2 Boston Acoustics Mini-130x speakers and it sounds great. Exceeded expectations.
4,I hooked this up to some small bookshelf speakers. Sounds amazing will rattle the walls! Only complaint on super bass driven songs the grill will fall off.
5,An excellent addition to your home theater system.
5,My previous on died on me. It lasted a little over 12 years. Shame I had to throw it out because it still looks brand new. With the exception of the tiny spiderman figurine my son stuck in the port when he was 4. Great bass sound that definitely fills the media room.
5,After owning the Polk N1 soundbar for a few years I couldn't take the 'bass' rattle any longer. This sub is great sounds great and has the necessary tuning options. If you have the N1 definitely get this sub.Anyone else needing a powered sub I also would recommend this for the price.
5,I replaced the receiver in my home theater setup without realizing that my current sub woofer was not compatible.  So I did some comparison shopping and narrowed my options down to this one and a bigger one.  I'm glad I chose this one because it was more than enough for my setup.  We have a pretty decent sized living room but it does the job whether I am wanting some low end filler or even if I want the windows to rattle a bit.  Highly recommended!I am by no means an audio expert so my opinion should only matter to the average home theater user like me.
5,After years of having an incomplete (subwoofer-less) surround system I finally purchased this gorgeous subwoofer.  High quality easy to set up and beautiful sounding deep bass tones that really add to the surround sound experience.  No distortion and easy set up.  This is an excellent subwoofer with plenty of power and more for a small to mid size surround sound system.
5,Excellent Value - Shakes my house when I need it to thumps soft and provides richness in other areas when needed. Great for movies gaming and music. If you have a good receiver it will make a difference
4,I'm using the speaker to compliment a set of Audioengine A2+ speakers. The Polk is driven from the line out of the A2+. The result is ok for music but I believe my setup limits the experience. For a 5.1 movie application I'd recommend looking for a sub with more capacity.
4,Slight rattle at some frequencies think there is a fix but haven't opened it up to try it. Ported is not as accurate as sealed but books better. For the price performance and power it's not a bad deal.
5,I have two of these subs hooked up to my HK990 Harman Kardon Reciever with a pair of Polk Monitor 70 speakers and I can't be more happier with the quality of sound these subs have added to my system. They have plenty of power for my choice of music which is 95% metal. They hit nice and hard with nice tight bass. Would totally recommend to anyone wanting good bass from an inexpensive sub woofer. Polk Audio makes a great product.
4,Livingroom set up was a gradual process as my wife was originally against having a tv upstairs.  Our main theater is in our basement set up.  Using our old surround set up previously used in the theater.  Good thing is that the wife can't stand the tv speakers so I talked her into this subwoofer and now able to add the rear surround speakers over this holiday season.  Subwoofer perfect the 20' x 20' livingroom.  This is my 2nd PSW10.
5,Amazing sub. I have it as low end to my surround sound system. Plenty of bass and enough power to play really loud. Great sound quality.
1,The sub-par polk bass 10 inch woofer was not what I thought it would be with all the great reviews about this particular sub-woofer. Boy I was sadly mistaken. The speaker is ok at best. I had it connected to a Denon AVR-S750H which is a pretty good receiver but it sounded horrible. The speaker/woofer sound was very distorted when turned up to high volume levels. The bass was not strong enough to clear a basement theater system. The woofer had more tone than deep bass. You will probably need 3 or 4 of these for what I call shake the room type of an experience.  This speaker is good for a bedroom or home office but not a theater system. I do not believe the wattage is correct because it didn't sound like it was pushing 100 watts maybe 50/65 watts at best.
5,This bass sounds really good with my music and movies (matched up w/ two Polk 40s).  I have to keep the bass' volume knob at half-way otherwise it's too loud and overpowering.  I couldn't see needing anything more powerful; in fact I wouldn't mind if this unit were a bit smaller since I'm never going to fully utilize all it has to offer.  I chose this based on reading other purchasers' reviews that it's a hard option to beat for its quality and price.  I'd agree with that especially since I got this brand new for $89 (via Vanns on Amazon) and am 100% happy with it.
5,This baby rocks.  You won't regret.  Great price
4,Great subwoofer for the price
5,Blows my aging Yam*h* sub away...literally.  Sure it thumps at moderate to high levels; what I love about it is the lows I am hearing now at normal to low volume levels that I never heard with my yammi .  At 1/3 the price and twice the performance IMHO its a no-brainer...just buy it.
5,Just get it you'll enjoy you music much more! Great value for the money.
5,Absolutely in love with this SUB. I use it in a home studio and it outputs exactly what I need on the low-end without sounding exaggerated or too "boxy" as some subs can be. Also the frequency range is exceptionally better than newer/more modern sub models. I'm sure it would sound great with any sound system setup you may need it for. Also the price is definitely one to take advantage of!
5,Love it
5,I am super pleased with the sound quality. I added it to a Yamaha 1080 ATS soundbar and movies sound great now especially  for not having a 5.1 type system.
5,It looks very nice and puts out perfect bass for my small room. I would recommend something more powerful if you are putting in your living room or if you have a big bedroom.
5,This is an awesome sub. I had a 12" that was stolen & everyone wanted more then I originally paid then I came across this one. Didn't think it was going to be as good as my previous one. To tell the truth it's much better! I've owned numerous other companies speaker systems and Polk Audio to me is the best.
4,Really good sound for price.  I would put them up 200 dollars and above.  I was running KLH kick ass sub wolfer for 15 years and well miss it.
5,I've been impressed with the performance from this thing. Replaced an old sub that I blew out.The sub is a bit bigger than I anticipated (make sure the dimensions fit your needs) but fits comfortably in my setup.Strong product for the cost.
5,Just added this sub to my ghetto audiophile system. It definitely delivers the crisp bass my system was lacking. I'm using this sub with a vintage pair of Acoustic Research AR 18B's all driven by an SMSL SA-50 amp. Input is from an ASUS DG PCI sound card (CHEAP!) into a Fiio DAC (optically). I'm loving this setup to pieces!I've only had it up and running for a couple hours so I can't give you an in-depth review. But if you're looking for an excellent inexpensive sub woofer this one will not not make you mad for buying it!
5,...squirrels.  Ha... you thought I was going to say girls.  No sir.  I'm not perverted such as yourself.  get a life.  I have a life thank you very much.  No... I will not do that.  OK fine... I digress.  Hooked this to my zvox and boom... my neighbors call the cops every other day now.  It's all good though.  I don't hate.  I just turn it up louder in the mornings and my garden hose accidentally turns on at 7:30 in the am on the way to work.
5,I use this unit attached to my entertainment system for movies music and gaming..  It delivers excellent base and is fully adjustable Hz and volume dials on the back.  Reproduces gunfire grenades and explosions so you can feel the battle field.  Definitely recommend.....
5,The speakers sounds amazing the speaker quality to the low end sound is amazing no distortion that i can discern I was really just looking for a sub-woofer and for the price it really couldn't be beat.  I rated a 5 because of the quality of sound how it looks the picture doesn't do it justice like i mentioned I just wanted a replacement sub-woofer and this one amazed me it has a built in amp and you can change the phase of the wave 0 degrees and 180 degrees.  High quality look.  I do recommend this one.
5,Great brand.  Good price.  I have one of these to the left of the entertainment center.  The wood grain siding is a nice touch - these things don't look or feel cheep.  I get as much base as I could want with adjustments on the back.  If you want to blow the place down you probably could but I keep it about half way dialed.... not all the way.  I couldn't have picked a better subwoofer for the job.
5,For $90 this thing puts out amazing sound.  It is pretty tall though so make sure you get the dimensions.Measures 14 by 14.38 by 16.12 inches (WxHxD).I have it in a living/dining area maybe 12'x 40' and it puts out tons of undistorted bass. Have it hooked up to a Yamaha RX V781.
5,good value
5,Wow what more can u expect from a 99.00 sub??  this thing beats!! crystal clear and tight!!  Have a friend with a polk 12inch 505 sub it has more watts and a bigger speaker but this thing is as clear as that although not as much watts but still sounds as good as that if not better i listen to death metal rap and alot of classical and things with bass drops and this will do them just have to have a decent receiver and play with the lfe a bit and placement!! after that good to go!!  very happy! amazon like always delivered it fast and prompt!!
4,Still trying to find the happy zone. Easy to get them boomy harder to get a great balance. Matter of taste. But worth the purchase. I am a novice so it is taking longer for me to determine what is perfect for me.
5,I have always chose the Very Good Subwoofers that I wanted and like this one it is also one of the GREAT ONES THAT I ORDERED!!!
5,Some of the reviews said this was a bit under powered.  I suffer from a little hearing loss due to my time in service and this thing still blows me away sometimes.  It is the sub-woofer for our AV system in a room that is 24'x22' and completely fills the room with rich sound.  When we watch an action movie we feel every explosion.  I'm running it through a Yamaha receiver that set the levels automatically so maybe it just did it right.  All I know is I love watching movies with thing.
5,heavy construction and great sound from a smaller enclosure. easy connect and setup. 5 year warranty. brand name.  very low price.  suggest purchase cable with RCA Y connection for amps/receiver  with single port RCA  connection.  slightly better sound . a recommended buy.
5,Just got this today and I am blown away by the quality of sound I get from this sub. I am glad I waited a few extra days to buy this as the price dropped thirty bucks and I ordered it one click as soon as I saw that. I live in an 800sqft apt and this sub turned up a quarter of the way makes for a great sounding system and doesn't make your equipment work so hard so it lasts longer. Turned up all the way though I'm sure you'll get a pissed off neighbor lol.
5,Replaced an 8" Polk sub that was part of an older 2.1 setup from Polk. I've been a Polk fan since the 1990's.  The old sub still worked but the RCA input section burned up and setup with speaker level inputs was weak. This sub sounds great and suits our needs perfectly. Mostly music on Pandora or TV occasional movies and 3.1 setup all Polk monitors. Using a low end Yamaha 5.1 rcvr all HDMI that's 1 year old with our Roku player or Comcast cable TV.
4,Wait unil a couple of months for it to break in then it sounds great. Also there is a port cover inside the unit that when removed makes it sound great
5,This is the second one of these babies that I have purchased. I used two of them for a party in a pretty big recreation hall. Plenty of bass. They are only 50 watts each but very efficient. However I will probably not do that again. They sound much better in a house setting. If you like raw power these are not for you. If you want awesome sound out of your surround sound at home at a very reasonable price consider this woofer. Just remember you get what you pay for. A 50 watt amp pushing a very efficient woofer in a larger port vented efficient enclosure. Recommended.
3,I have 2 of these and I bought them at separate times.  I thought adding a second one would help but you really can't even tell the difference.  It's a low power sub and seems to work fine and it's reliable but when you crank it up the base gets sloppy.  Low to mid-level volume it works great.  And really for the money when you can find them on sale they are worth it if you aren't looking for wall-rattling bass.
4,Makes good base
3,I know this is a budget subwoofer that has been marked down significantly from the original price. I think the original price listed is too high. It seems to be really boomy at a very narrow frequency range. I know you don't get much for this price so it might be a decent deal considering that. However sometimes it's worth throwing more money into something for better quality. I'm torn over rating it poorly because it is underwhelming or rating it well because it's super cheap.
5,This is a great Sub!!! There is tuning that everyone needs to do based on the room (acoustics) and placement of your surround sound speakers but this is hands down a great product. I have not used it for music I bought it specifically for TV gaming and movies. It works great for all of them! I will buy more for christmas presents.
4,I used this sub to help out my phase tech 1.1 pc series 2 bookshelves.  For my setup 25% volume blends well at 80hz.  Totally worth a few Benjamins.  I only use this stereo system with music.  This sub sounds great with music.  Rage Nirvana Unplugged and NIN were my test records.
5,First home theater sub I ever bought. I am a car audio guy. For only 50 watts it put out bass that will shake your house. I'll probably upgrade into a 300 watt sub in the next 3 years or so. This one will do for now as a starter.
5,It's a subwoofer... Excellent quality driver nice finish not real impressed after all this time with the front grill it seems to be looking ratty. But I can recover it so that's not a big deal... Works great I have had this for a couple of years now hasn't disappointed me
5,Did what it promised quite happy with what I got for the price can’t lose
5,Bass sounds awesome and sound quality is outstanding
5,I purchased the PSW10 from Amazon (seller).I like the way it sounds.It works very well so far.I was a little concerned that the unit didnt always come on when the switch is in the auto-on position when I would turn the AVR on but I am pretty sure it is because not all tv programs contain low enough audio freq's to trigger the unit on.
5,I love this subwoofer.  Great sound and looks nice!  It gives my system the boost it needed.
5,Great addition to our home theater. Ran this in a 7.2 configuration with a wireless transmitter. Rattles the house along with the 12 inch sub I have on the other side of the room
5,This thing works and sounds great. It was originally purchased as a backup sub when my infinity sub quit working. But to my surprise it sounds about the same. I am a audio freak and have went through a lot of different subs in the past. But to my amazement this sub has blown away all of my low expectations about it. It is a great speaker at a super low price. You cant find anyone close to this in the same price range. Its a little punchy at first till you break it in but after that it sounds incredible. Hope this helps Brad
5,WOW... I was extremely impressed with the Sound Quality of this speaker!!No need to buy bigger as this items deliveries all the Bass you need!!
5,Awesome speaker used it for home theater system 👍 love feeling the rumbling of the bass I purchased a set of Polk audio bookshelf speakers it sounds awesome
5,Bought two of these for my home theater and they work amazing
5,Great bass for your buck
5,El diseño y el tamaño
5,Na
5,I ordered this sub as a scratch and dent for a lower price from amazon warehouse deals. It was actually brand spanking new and didn’t have a single scratch! It sounds pretty awesome! It is lacking a little on the lower end of the frequency range but for the price I paid this thing really can’t be beat!!
5,I’m very pleased with this sub. Powerful and accurate sound.  I use this with a Klipsch set of speakers and the sound is fantastic.
5,What’s not to like at $100. Great add to my Fluance  Ai60s. No hum/buzz as other reviews mentioned.
5,This sub provided the low end punch to compliment my RS10 bookeshelf speakers which are only driven by 20w per side. Pretty tight and not too boomy when xover point is swept to the sweet spot for position and room. . Very nice
3,Updated: this subwoofer worked great for 3 1/2 years. Stopped working with blown fuse. New fuses blow immediately. Driver works fine upon testing.Amplifier seems to be problem. Decent tech support from Polk and maybe this is all one can expect at this price point. They gave me steps to check each possible problem area on the speaker.  They said this is now out of warranty and would not be replaced by Polk. Think I might go with another brand and pay a little more for better longevity.
5,Have to be careful how loud I set this thing. Apartment living has it's downside but this thing will vibrate the floor when I do crank it. Even when I did crank things up I did not hear the vibration of the screen that some people have mentioned here. Definitely a good starter sub.
5,Now if you want good clarity of bass at not a high price point this is the box. I’ve had it for 3 months and does not disappoint. Movies sound awesome and even the Xbox sounds awesome! Oh and the frequency crossover is great
5,Amazing! I have a medium size family room of about 400 sq ft with high ceiling and this little monster can rock the place and gives a true theater like feeling. Buy it and you will experience it. I paid roughly $76 on Amazon last Christmas. I was looking at few models made by Klipsh. I am glad I saved money and got pretty much same quality.
5,I love it
5,This subwoofer has great sound and bass. It was easy to connect to our receiver.
5,I use this for my home theater in a room that's about 450 square feet. It sits nicely in a bookcase under the screen and fills the room with rich base. It took a few days to "break in". I also love the auto-on/off feature.
5,Polk Audio has always been a leader high quality audio reproduction.  There are so many very high quality speaker companies to choose from it is hard to make a decision.  I have heard this sub in a store compared to other like subs.  The speaker was not the loudest but defiantly the riches and smoothest in the low range.  I am using this sub and JBL speakers as a second audio source for listening to mastered mixes in my recording studio.  I find it accurately represents those frequencies that the JBL's are incapable.  I recommend this sub for its rich smooth sound and price.
5,Excellent product
5,This is a great subwoofer for that home stereo unit it’s thundering bass we have been on three out of 10 volume
5,Replaced an old speaker 🔊
5,For the price and size it's great for our needs.
5,Very tight bass.  Great for a small room or studio.  Amazing speaker for the money.
5,would recommend polk
5,Very happy with the quality of sound. Bought it to replace an older subwoofer that no longer worked. Completes our surround sound.
5,Great addition to my 20 year old system! I blew out the speaker on my old one didn't realize how much I missed without it. Polk Audio products are the best in the business for my dollars.
5,Added this sub to my living room home theater. This produces fantastic sound and is cost effective. I might get another one for my surround system in my bedroom as that sub is humming.  Great product.  Recommend and will eventually buy another for the bedroom.
5,An excellent speaker for the price
5,Never thought I would love having a powered sub woofer but I do. Every time it kicks in whether a movie is playing or from a song I look at my wife and say "isn't that awesome?" My kids can't break it and they have tried playing music on it to see what it can do and it handles no prob. You will be very happy with this sub woofer.
5,This is a great subwoofer for the 80 dollars I paid. I have it hooked up to my Onkyo TX-NR509 5.1 Channel Network A/V Receiver along with the two smaller but powerful speakers. These speakers didn't have very good low end so I added this subwoofer and now I am listening to very good sounding music in my room. let me be one of the seventh hundreth people to reccommend this product to you.Tips:read the instructions before purchasing since you will also need to purchase or find wires OR a cable to hook this thing up. Also follow other steps for best sound. here is the instructions[...]
5,When I watch the DVD of Earthquake my windows rattle like I am in the quake. I feel like I am in the theater again where I first saw that movie.I have this connected to a 5.1 receiver and my TV (flat panel speakers what a joke). Even with bookshelf speakers (12" woofers mids and tweets) there was not the right amount of bass. This powered subwoofer creates it. In fact I have to keep turning the subs volume down so there should be plenty for any needs.
5,Bumping very clear faithfully reproduced bass.  Blends perfectly with the rest of the sound system.  Easy to set up.  Great value for the price.
5,I'm not an audio expert all I know is that this subwoofer sounds amazing! Shakes the room when it's turned up high and seems really responsive. I absolutely love it.
4,Product works as expected. I was running with a front left front right and center speaker before purchasing this sub and 2 polk satellites. The subwoofer adds great depth to my entry level 5.1 setup and as I live in a multi-unit complex I really appreciate the easy to access volume control on the back so that I can turn the base down late at night. Excellent subwoofer for the price and I would certainly recommend it for any entry level systems.
5,excellent product
4,I got this subwoofer for an apartment as I didn't want a giant black box taking valuable real estate in my living room. I knew Polk Audio makes a good product. This small subwoofer has no problems handling both home theater and music listening with a nice low rumble with power to spare. Shipping was fast and free which is a plus for such a heavy component. Well worth the low price to pay for a quality addition to my home theater.
5,This is a great sub.  Music through it is awesome.  I heard a little muddiness listening to Jurassic Park T-rex roars at very loud volumes but not sure anyone else noticed it and it was loud enough that my wife wanted it quieter anyway.  Anyway this will be more than powerful enough for the vast majority of home audio setups and the real audiophiles will go with one or two 12" subs.
4,I originally bought a Sony sub (SA-W2500) for my small HT system but I'm glad I decided to replace it with this. The Sony certainly gives you "booms" but the Polk actually accents the rest of the audio rather than overpowering it. It's worth the extra $30; I have it paired with Polk T15 bookshelf speakers and a Pols TL1 slim center channel and it compliments them nicely.
5,This little guy is awesome the bass is so loud I have to keep it really low to be respectful to my neighbors
5,This thing is fantastic. I was worried based off the low price but I received a new stereo receiver as a gift and needed a powered sub to go with it. This thing hits the lows quite well be it music movies or gaming. Well worth the purchase if you're looking for a budget addition to your home system.
5,Was used for bass I live in an apartment that to small for the amount of bass
5,This sub was way more than I expected for under $100. First of all the bass response is great. It's got all the features I wanted and there are multiple input options (rca single sub cable speaker pass through). I bought this to accompany my AudioSource S3D60 soundbar which is a low to mid class soundbar. My complaint about the soundbar was that I didn't get good separation of mids and lows. This sub fixed the problem. Now the only issue is keeping things on my walls. It pounds and I have to turn the volume on it way down to keep everything in the room from shaking.
4,for the price you pay you cannot beat it it does the job well enough. Better than the other budget subwoofers I have tried.I also own a SVS1000 which blows this out of the water but of course it costs 4 times as much so it is all about how much you are willing to pay.
5,Upgraded my previous sub which was a cheap all in one box set of 5 speakers + the sub.  Been slowly upgrading the speakers as I could afford them and left the sub until the last one and what a world of difference it made.  This is a great speaker and made a huge improvement on the overall sound of my home theater system.  Movies and music both sound entirely different now.  I would certainly recommend this to anyone especially for the price of around $100.00.
5,I love it. Money well spent. Compact doesn’t take to much space.  Quality bass.  Feels like I’m at the movies or at a concert.  Highly recommended.
4,Great sound for the price
5,Once I got it adjusted and positioned to my liking I was very impressed with the bass. It is a very good sub for the money.
5,I'm very picky and when I got this sub as a gift. I scoffed a bit because it wasn't up to the level of my higher end system or so I thought. After I set it up I was very pleased that it put egg in my face for scoffing at it. It doesn't do as well at under 35 Hz but everything else it does extremely well. For the lower frequencies I have a second sub setup that picks up the lower stuff. But for 90% of the population I believe this sub will meet and exceed your expectations.
5,I've had this sub for a month now. Is hooked to my Onkyo AV receiver. Oh man what a difference in sound quality with movies and especially listening to music. Very pleased with this sub. I'd recommend to anyone looking for a nice sub and decent price!
5,I am not a techy but product was easy to hook up. I have it connected to a Vizio sound bar and it adds a lot of dimension to the sound. I have it set up in a living room about 12 by 18.  Bass does  not over do it and it blends in well. I play pandora thru the system and the music is great. I bought a refurbished sound bar plus this sub woofer and have a pretty decent system for under $ 170 . It does have a little bigger footprint then other models in this category so make sure you measure.
5,Added this sub to my stereo I have in my 1200 sf pole barn so far it has worked great gives the music a extra little bump on base I also use it with my 2 Polk tower speakers that can handle major amount of watts
5,I bought to replace lousy subwoofer that came with entertainment system.  Big difference since old sub was not powered.  I keep the sub volume at level 4 and my walls shake very powerful.  My entertainment system is 1000 watts and it never sounded this good.  Love it.
5,I plan on buying another one of these for my home theater system. these have a nice deep thump for the scary or action part of the movies which is the point of having a subwoofer for a home theater room. It has the same shine and quality of the polk center channel I purchased model CS10.
5,Does what it says : ) Comparable to Subs for more than twice the price = great value. Be sure to connect your speaker through this unit - great crossover.
5,At first thought it was silver and kept looking.  Found last picture and that it’s all black.  Great overall value.
5,Bought this to leave with a surround sound system that stays with our house as we sell it.  I currently have a HTD 10" level two......that I simply love. Since I paid $349.00 for  HTD  and the polk was under $100.00 it was s no brainer.  I found this on amazon I couldn't beat the price or the free shipping.  I must say that I am impressed.  The lows are thundering and I seems to be really responsive.  The only draw back is the higher lows they really seem to be lacking but for the price I have no complaints.
5,Very solid
5,This sub has worked great for me thus far. People are hating on it but the reproduction thus far has been acceptable. I don't value bass as much as others despite the significant effect it has on others. This sub has contributed to the overall sound field of my latest setup. I recommend it for a starter sub.
5,Once i found the sweet spot in the room the sound was just what i was looking for in music as well as in movies. Well worth it! The bass was deep and rich the cabinet was well made. Would highly recommend and would buy again!
4,I have this in the garage to add some bass to my system. It thumps away like a champ and really brought a total overall sound to my garage that I like. Worth the buy.
5,Excellent really completes your sound system.
5,Unbelievable pure low tones and bass.  Brings movies to life!  No unwanted vibration.  Many easy ways to hook up to ANY system even systems that are not designed for Subs.  Auto on and off feature (senses sound signal coming in to turn on and off).
5,Real low end base for not a lot of money.  Can't say it's the best sounding unit out there but for the cost it's the best thing without spending hundreds more.  Had a super high end audio sub costing 5 times more that lasted about 4 years then died manufacturer doesn't make parts for it any longer offered me to buy another one.  I'm sure they would love for me to spend $600 every few years.
5,Best bang for the buck by so far it's not even funny! I like quality sounding music and this thing delivers! I'm impressed with the range of base that I could get out of it and it's loud enough to perfectly compliment my sound blaster roar blue tooth speaker! The roar and this sub make for an awesome combo! Couldn't be happier for a 100$ steal!
5,I purchased this subwoofer for my Denon AVRS530BT which didn't have powered output line only Pre-out. My living room is small and with this subwoofer all the room shakes. Some movies and songs show very powerful deep notes that I never heard them before. I pretty happy with this purchase. I highly recommend it for small-medium rooms.
4,Not bose but sure brought plenty of life to my media room! I loved the price point as well as the performance of this product! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for ground shaking bass added to your media room!
4,I needed a subwoofer to pair with my KRK Rockit 5 studio monitors and this subwoofer does a great job.It's aesthetic appearance is classy and it packs a solid punch. Even with my EQ tweaked to tons of bass the bass produced remains clear up to about 85% volume and then only a slight distortion after that. The only drawback for me was that the speaker outs are designed for home audio but that's quickly fixed with an adapter.
5,I need a powered subwoofer to go along with a new receiver for my media room. I didn't want to overspend but wanted some quality. Amazing price and the sound is excellent.I've been able to adjust the volume settings to have a nice filling bass that doesn't rattle the walls. Perfect for what I needed.
4,Sounds good bought two of them for movie watching bass distribution fills the room.
4,Very nice. Added this Sub to my bedroom 5.1 system. The room is 12x12 so I was worried it would be to much but my Yamaha dials in the sound automatically. It's a bit boomy sometimes but very accurate with music. Good looking good deal for the price. Happy. Customer service easy to work with. Great for the money.
3,Showed up blown sub rattling when played!I install TV and home theaters I’ve used this sub many times great piece . Could’ve been roughed up during shipping who knows.
5,I had the proper equipment to plug it into my surround system amp. The speaker worked perfectly from the first moment. The controls on the back helped to set it to my taste in quality sound. The 10 inch subwoofer is not the smallest subwoofer on the market nor is it the largest. For me it is perfect.
5,Provided the bottom end I wanted for my home theater. Works great. I thought about putting 2 of them in but I don't need the second one.
4,Goo stuff....right level of bass & ability to filter very low frequencies... hooked to my Yamaha receiver RXV 475...works well...I wish it culd take 220 V as well...had to buy a step down transformed...
4,I bought this and an amp for 7.1 audio. All the other speakers were good used speakers. Veonice result
5,I didn't know what to expect but for a smaller package it performs very well.  It does everything I wanted it to do primarily for a surround sound system.  I am impressed with the power of the bass given the conservative power rating.  It doesn't take up too much space and looks good as well. The price was an added incentive.  I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to others.  I think they will be pleased as well.
4,Perfect for a smaller room. Priced right.  I have this paired with some Edifier powered bookshelf speakers in our bedroom and it sounds very good.
4,Good quality and sound.
5,Polk as always puts out a fantastic product
5,This speaker is very strong with a great bass quality. The sound compliments the rest of our Bose system well. Our old subwoofer went out and this was a much more affordable replacement and sounds just as good as the Bose did.
5,Great sounds quality and impressive bass
5,Sounds great
5,I've read a lot of reviews before buying this product. This sub is everything that was stated about it & then some! I'm using it with a Yamaha RX-V471 receiver & a set of DV-62SI speakers for music & a 32" LED TV in a finished garage. I have less than $600 in it & WOW this system is definitely good enough for a living room entertainment center with a larger TV of coarse. This unit produces plenty of good low distortion bass You simply can't beat this sub for the money (less than a $100 here!)
4,Not much to say about this subwoofer other than it sounds great especially for the price. Unfortunately I noticed that mine came with a defect which is why it only gets 4 stars.
5,Still figuring out some of the things on settings but I'm getting great sound from this speaker.  It's my first polk subwoofer so far it is working well.  I have bose speakers front mid and rear with a subwoofer in front.  I'm using this polk at the rear of our living room and it makes a real difference.  I'll see how it holds up.
4,Buen producto  a buen precio
2,This sub is severely mediocre.Auto on off feature works well as long as your low pass freq is turned up high enough from amp. Extensive port noise. Weak amp.Could use slightly more baffling inside. Recommend goggling how to upgrade this sub. Slight tweaks improve this sub.Bass response does hit down into the 35hz range. Which is not as low as the monitor 60s that I have this sub paired with.If you need a sub to take some of the heat off your front speakers this will do well enough. If you’re looking for ground shaking theater sound. This sub will not be for you.
5,This sub does exactly what it is intended for. It is rated at 50 watts and is appropriately paired with my mini bookshelf speakers (50 watts per speaker). It is a good combo for a smaller room because it adds clear low end to the sound without overpowering. Don't be baited into buying a 6.5 or 8 inch for a smaller room it won't hit the lows correctly.If you can only use speaker level inputs fear not. I used 16 gauge wire and it sounds clear.
5,This thing is awesome for the price!!  Paired this with a couple of other speakers here on Amazon and this thing really makes the system complete...  I use this in a poolhouse.  For a main listening area - I would probably go with something a little more "tight" but for the price - you could put these in any number of listening areas and get the awesome bass feel....
2,I ordered this unit to complement the pair of Polk Audio Monitor 60 speakers I already own to which the unit bears a stylistic resemblance.  I assume that the subwoofer was the work of the same design team that did the Monitor 60.  I love the sound of the Monitor 60s.  It's sweet understated yet solid and convincing good for reproducing classical music.  This comment is from a guy who spent six months making the rounds from dealer to dealer looking for the perfect grand piano.This unit was extensively reviewed with generally good ratings and seemed like a good choice for a budget subwoofer.  Unfortunately when I plugged it in it exhibited a noticeable line a/c hum.  After some analysis I concluded that this noise has two components: a vibration from the power supply transformer that seems to be amplified by the enclosure and hum from the woofer itself.  This hum seems to come from residual line a/c hum that the power supply was not able to completely filter out.  The 60 Hz fundamental seems to be OK; the noiseI contacted Polk Audio customer support; they were attentive and responsive and sent me a replacement amplfier.  Unfortunately the new amp had the same behaviors.The hum is barely audible at 10 ft away when the system is idling.  I thought long and hard whether I could live with and decided to return the unit.  I purchased a used Yamaha YST-SW215.  It is smaller and loses a few of the lowest notes to the PSW10 but it's absolutely quiet.
5,This is intended as an add-on to a sound bar which just didn't have the 'grunt' to fill a 32 X 32 room. For clean crisp bass you need a self powered sub even at low volume. The adjustable crossover and volume control make setup and balancing simple. At 26 lbs and with rubberized feet this unit stays firmly planted on the floor at high power levels. And the final touch is the smart power control that shuts the unit off when the rest of your system is off so there is no hiss or hum in stand-by. Good engineering good price good value.
5,This subwoofer is the bane of my existence. I purchased it for our 16 year old son's birthday to enhance the surround sound system. He loves it. I can tell you the bass is quite good even at lower volumes. I cannot hear anything but bass in fact as I sleep in the room right above it. If I go down stairs to turn the volume down I can barely hear dialog from whatever is on. If you are looking for an inexpensive subwoofer and not an audiophile then I would recommend it.
5,Absolutely amazing subwoofer for home theater system creates a full sound and deep room filling base. It's compact enough that it can be hidden if so desired. I listened to many subwoofers before buying this some were quite a bit more expensive too but I found this Polk Audio to have the best compliment to the rest of my system. I give this my highest recommendation it's a must have for completing your home theater system and you can't beat the value you get for the price of it.
4,This is a great subwoofer. Obviously it's budget so it's not everything one can dream of but it definitely gets the job done. The bass rumble after a hit is a bit inaccurate and recovery is a little laggy. But overall at $68 this is an unbeatable subwoofer. People complaining about port noise well they should get some Mediabridge 24K Gold Plated RCA Cables. Those are fantastic and eliminated any noise.
5,Excellent sound. Great sound for a woofer.
3,Its a sub 100 dollar subwoofer but it does sound good when dialed in for the type of music and volume you are listening to. I would think a much higher end sub woul be able a much broader range of highs and lows and therefore provide the same controlled "thump" without having to turn the rear power up or down. I do like the black finish. However the speaker cover is more like a plate in front of the speaker cone with a 0.5 inch gap between the screen plate and the cone so yo can actually stand above the speaker and see between the 2 athrough the floor. I think this will allow excessive dust to collect on the cone. maybe it's no big deal but prefer a completely covered speaker not a face plate.
5,For the money this sub is great for movies. I think it does the most for the power and money and sounds good in my small living room. I've rated it for what it is. Audiophiles might not like this. So if you're picky about sound reproduction then you know that can cost big money.
4,Sounds well
5,I purchased this to pair with a Vizio SB200 sound bar that I purchased for a good price.  At first I was a tiny bit disappointed.  After finding a an optimal position and the optimal settings for this sub it makes watching cable tv so much more enjoyable.If you have realistic expectations for this sub you will be happy.  You are not going to get the lows that a $200+ sub will provide.For the record I am currently using a single subwoofer rca cable plugged into the L input / freq turned all the way clockwise / and sub level at about 50%.
5,Really thumps those low bass frequencies. I turn it back to about 1/3 of its volume. It's larger than I expected. I'm using it in a small home studio but it should really make your home theater jump. I don't know how they can sell and ship something this size and weight so inexpensively but I'm happy.
5,Sound is great for the value completes the surround sound. Very clean bass easy to adjust to your preference of sound
5,Always been a fan of Polk Audio my original system was a Yamaha receiver with 5.1 surround sound Polk Audio speakers bought a new Sony 4K AV receiver and had to buy a new sub because the old one finally went out after 15 years
4,Sound quality is great for the price as long the amp supports RCA  to sub it will work great.  I do wish  there were more outputs on the sub itself tho.
5,Great Bass for very little money. Very pleased.
5,I've had this sub now for about four months. I absolutely love it. I have a really small 200 square foot living room and this sub shakes the place.Not only is it powerful but it's also very clear sounding. I never realized how muddled the sound was in my old subwoofer until I plugged this one in. It was like the clouds parted and the sun started shining - but still with thunder!
5,Great sound for med to small rms i would buy again whith out question
5,Wow. Crazy good bass sound out of this driven by a Denon amp. Costs nearly twice as much at Best Buy. Did I say Wow?? Just buy it. You won't be disappointed. I read a lot of reviews on the internet before buying this. Even sound engineers are quite surprised at the quality of this subwoofer. I'm no sound engineer and I was not compensated in any way for this review.Thanks Polk. I'm looking closer at all your products from now on.
5,Awesome sub for the money. Bought as a replacement for my 20 year old sub and enhances my entire system. I have the volume on the sub at about 1/4 and it's perfect for an apartment. Paired with my Sony STR-DG1200 receiver it has plenty of bang for the buck. Great quality and looks good. Just make sure you have room for it in tight quarters it is about 16" square. Not exactly "compact" as stated. Very happy with this unit the price and Amazon.
5,I ordered this sub after reading reviews.  Im very happy with the quality and sound.Had a harmon kardon 5.1 speaker system with an Onkyo receiver. Usually the subwoofers that come in a speaker bundle are not great.so once we replaced the HK sub with this Polk model the entire system sounds amazing even at low volume.Highly recommend this subwoofer.  So if you don't have $500 to get a Velodyne  this is the next best for a fraction of the price!!
4,Sounds great. Only issue was the plastic feet all cracked after a month or two. I made some new epoxy feet for it.
4,It's ok. Sound isnt great but I didnt need a lot of punch it's in a cabinet below the tv. good price.
5,Awesome sub! I bought this though believe it is a bit too big for my current house but love that I can control the volume output appropriate for the current home size and plan to use this in the next house as well. Was also pleasantly surprised that there is actually a nice black cover over the front so you don't see the actual speaker and air hole as displayed here. Wonderful product.
5,After adding 2lbs poly fill and removing the metal thing on the bass port I got a really nice sub especially after calibration. Running this with :Polk cs10Polk monitor 60sFluance XLBPStrdh750I'd highly recommend the two mods and you got a pretty decent sub. I'm using this in a 15x20 living room and it sounds pretty good
5,Like sound quality use with surround sound
5,Great sound. Wonderful price. Easy set up. Looks great. Highly recommended.
5,Good bang for the buck! I don’t need to shake the house down. Added plenty enough bass.
5,Perfect for anyone that loves noise and bass
5,Good Value!
5,Amazing sound it has taken my sound system to another level!
5,Great sounding for the money. I practice drums so the sub woofer gives me all the bass I need.Thank youRon G.
5,I have an older Bose acoustimass speaker system with the passive sub-woofer. I was always missing that "rumble" feel when watching movies and never really got that "thump" when playing music but this Polk powered sub-woofer is just what I needed. My receiver has a pre out jack then you just leave the Bose system hooked up the way it is and add the Polk. I only have the Polk up half way and it "rumbles" and "thumps" and sounds great!This is a very nice powered sub-woofer for the price and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some more bass.
5,Does exactly what I needed it to do.  I have a Carver amp Adcom preamp and a couple of Sony Book shelf speakers which I set up to improve the  sound of my LG Television.  When I set it up there was not enough bass.  I considered buying better or larger speakers then the thought came to me to add a Sub.  I researched and found that this one fit my needs and budget.  It has done the job.
5,The PSW10 from Polk is replacing another brand that I really liked but is no longer available.  It worked out great though since the Polk is such good quality.  You CAN make it rumble but it provides a good bottom end without being boomy or overly noticeable.
5,I don't think you'll find a better value. Looks good and sounds good too. I see other reviews and got a good laugh. No! This is not a 500 watt 15" sub... set your expectations accordingly and you'll be pleased.
1,I dislike there customer service!!!!!  There is no Bass quality because they are not wo
5,Not much money to spend on a replacement sub and I was dubious that this could suit my needs. I was wrong! Fills my 11x12 TV room perfectly. Very smooth handling of the low-end of both music and cinema with plenty of "punch" when needed. (I first tested it by watching the opening sequence of Baby Driver.)
5,This is one of the best purchases I have made this year. This sub was the perfect addition to my soundbar on my living room TV. I think $90 is crazy - this thing sounds like it costs more than that. I have the volume at about 4 out of 10 - just under half way up - and this thing thumps like crazy. If you are looking for a reasonably priced sub and aren't looking to shatter windows (it does have its limits) I can't recommend this enough.
5,I purchased this to replace a 5 your old Teledyne that short circuited. Our theatre room is about 15' x 24'. We listen to music and watch a lot of movies. This speaker is more than enough power to fill the room at only the 50% setting. Great thumping base.Also as others have mentioned if you have a single subwoofer connection (LFE) you don't need a splitter. The instructions tell you what to do.Overall impressive for the price.
5,I went with all Polk speakers subwoofer and center and with my Onkyo receiver the surround sound is crisp and clear
5,Paired this with a set of Mackie CR3 speakers and the combo sounds better than both my Yamaha surround system and my Sony home stereo. Great combo and this thing throws a lot of bass which is good because I use this in my home studio and Im a bass player so yeah.
5,I've been using this woofer for about 6 months and I'm very pleased with it. Probably I exagerated on the size as my room is very small but I don't regret on getting a 12". I bought this mainly for music but i've found that it works best for movies. However I highly enjoy it for listening music. It goes very well over the lower frecuencies and will make your room shake as hell. Mine is connected to a Yamaha RX-V371BL receiver complemented with two Polk Audio Monitor 50 floorstanding speakers and they make a great system.
5,Great subwoofer  best bang for the buck ! High recommend as a budget sub woofer !
5,Works well
5,Was able to get this sub for $79 here on Amazon and while I was skeptical at first due to the price I am very glad I took a chance.  My prior system included a 12" Velodyne sub which could basically shake my whole block but I never though it sounded that good musically to justify it costing more than six times the price of this unit.  The sound is crisp and clear and you can really feel it rumble only when needed.  Paired with 4 Polk 8" in-wall speakers and my Marantz SR5006 receiver I couldn't be happier with this product.
5,Considering what I paid for it I got my moneys worth.
5,I got this to go with a Vizio 2.0 sound bar for the bedroom. I used the low level out from the sound bar to the low level input on the PSW10. I ended up with the crossover set about midway and the volume very low. It doesn't color the sound too much and it adds a very surprising punch to the sound in movies. For under a c-note this puppy rates a 5.
5,Great
4,Regular subwoofer
4,Not quite as good as my velodyne but very impressed!
5,This adds all the bass you need to a system.  I followed the instructions in the manual and set all my speakers to small so all the low end goes to the sub.  It worked out well and all the mids and highs are much clearer.  A great upgrade to a system.
4,Works great really booms. Had a rattle when I took it out of the box. Removed the rear cover and found a stray piece of wood. Removed and all is well.
4,I would consider myself a speaker nut and when I found myself needing a sub on a budget this came up. My expectations were not very high and once I got it set up it has been impressive. The bass is solid and responsive cabinet design is minimal and efficient hook ups are adequate. One drawback is that it lacks a LFE connection. I'm definitely thinking about getting a second one to complete the 7.2 setup.
3,Wow what a great cheap sub right? No not really. If you just want to round out the low-end of your small stereo this could be fine. For any discerning listener the bass is too mid-heavy and prone to distortion. There is a lot of port noise above half-volume so you'd want to remove the port shield to avoid the wet-fart noise it makes. The build quality is fine and it definitely improves the sound of most small systems but for the money you can do better.If you're considering one of these check out the Dayton SUB-1000.
5,Nothing
5,I have had this for about a year now and it sounds fantastic. The explosions are great and my house now sounds like what you hear in the theaters. If you put in a corner it sounds even better & it really fills the room with sound and will rattle the windows. I have never had the volume up more then 50% but when I get the Lord Of The Rings on Blu-ray I am going to pump it up all the way. This was a very good purchase & I got it at a very good price I recommend it to all.
4,This was a great deal because Best Buy was selling the same speaker for about $150 more because it's the "new" model which just means it's a different color.  We have about a 1000 sqft area in a finished basement that we are using this and it does a great job.  It's not overwhelming and as long as it's not turned up really loud does not disrupt everyone upstairs.
5,Got this Sub for my living room.  Amazing how much of a difference a Subwoofer can make!  Now I can stay upstairs to watch movies and not feel like I am missing anything.  Sounds great and looks great too.
5,I replaced my other sub-wolfer that I originally paid over $300 for because the speaker blew. I was shocked that this low priced sub-wolfer out performed my $300 speaker. This is the best value and quality for the price. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a great sounding sub-wolfer at a decent price.
5,I was able to get this for $79.99 which is a great deal for this amazing sub. I have it coupled with an Onkyo HT-RC330 receiver and these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GGXGU6/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00 Jamo speakers.One thing I've noticed is that when the sub is set on 'auto' it only turns on when bass is revved up. For example last night I was watching a movie and I noticed the red light was on (indicating the sub was turned off). Then a few seconds later the sub kicked on for a high intense action scene.For a 10" sub $80 for Polk is a must buy.
5,Running the PSW10 with a Yamaha receiver and a 4-speaker system in a small/mid sized room this thing sounds great. You can turn it up to a decent level to really hear those low frequencies boom. I found that it does start to distort with the level on about 75% and the receiver (100W) level on around 75% of max power. If you're looking for that chest pounding bass to fill a large room you probably want to consider a larger woofer with a lot more power but if you're just looking for a subwoofer at a decent price this thing is outstanding!
5,Give good base for my system. Much better than my other powers sub I got in a packaged deal. Used this with built in speakers.
5,I bought this to replace the 20 year old sub that I’ve had for my man cave sound system. It’s a no frills subwoofer but it does more than enough for movies and video games. It’s a very solid unit.
5,I have this sub in a bedroom and it’s perfect!
5,Great overall sub-woofer. This was bought to replacing an aging woofer that was 15 years old and I was pleasantly surprised and the thumping bass that it emitted after I plugged it in.  Very impressed with the sound quality and no added vibrations are present.  Great Product
5,I love this sub. I've had it for a little over a year now. For the price you can't go wrong. This sub fills my room with great authentic low end sound. I'm not an audiophile by any means but this sub sounds amazing. adding a sub to your home theater or stereo system adds so much. I'm so happy with this purchase.
5,This subwoofer fit my budget and has worked well in my modest home theater. I've been very happy with it.
5,Kicking base.  Favorite show off movie is the sledge hammer scene in John Wick 1.  NICE. Would have liked the ease of modern interface but was able to hook it up correctly and price is good for the value here
5,I only have good things to say about this product. I am not a dyed-in-the-wool ultra-audiophile but I do know good sound when I hear it. This small Polk unit fills a one thousand square foot space with omnipresent bass; that's more than one has a right to expect at the price point. So yeah I'd recommend it. I actually had to back it down a bit from mid-point for jazz and classical applications. It is really beautiful and I'd recommend the wood finish even though I ordered the black. Definitely a quality piece and it showed up in about two days standard.
5,I didn't pay attention to the actual size of this when I ordered two of them. I had it in mind that they would be about 10" square. I was very surprised to find they are much bigger. Once I rearranged things to put them in place though I have NO regrets whatsoever! These subwoofers fill the bill perfectly. I may buy another one for another room still - they add amazing depth to the sound without being overpowering. Of course I also tried cranking them up a bit and they will really rattle the windows if you want them to!
5,This woofer sounds like its hooked directly to a base guitar when playing music.  Wowed me out of the box.  If it last without any problems I couldn't be happier with the purchase.  Love the sound on this sub.
2,This is my initial review of the speaker and I have not even connected it.  The speaker arrived with the grill having a broken plastic pin.  Also the grill appears stressed and bows outward awkwardly both are an indication of poor product design.  No damage to the carton; it appears the pin was broken before shipment.  I attempted to call Customer Service but they have limited hours Mon-Fri so I'll need to wait until Monday and call back.  Also per their enclosed documentation I can call the 800 number and register the speaker (product).  This is not the case as there are no options to product registration.  The final message on Polk's IVR is that "For all other options Dial 0" does not work.  When I hit the 0 button I was told that as an invalid option.  So far not happy with Polk's quality control or customer service…I am hoping this is not an indication of the performance of the speaker itself.  Once I hook it up and hear how it performs I will update my review.
4,Great for the surround sound system for your tv and movies only knock is it doesn’t sound good with bass heavy rap music you will have to turn the sub down
5,Brings the sound to life! Took our living room audio to the next level. Auto power and configurable. Happy
5,I am no audiophile but I just set up my first 5.1 surround sound system in a 12'x12' living room. This subwoofer has been far more than I needed which gives me a lot of flexibility. Generally I have to keep the subwoofer volume low or else the whole living room will be vibrating.
5,Good item.  Replaced a Yamaha small sub-woofer I've had for many years....and has had connector issues sometime not 2working and sometimes scratchy and sometimes just silent.  Right size right price and fairly quick delivery (not that I was in any kind of hurry)..
5,So far this is amazing. Hooked up to a Yamaha yas-106 and I’m finding myself turning the bass down. Adds so much to the overall sound. Super impressed. I live in a small apartment and the PSW10 sounds so good. If you need bass this will be all you need. Thinking I need 2.
2,I got two of these on sale and thought the performance was good for the money but if you’re looking for deep loud bass for movies and music this doesn’t deliver the low frequencies that really hit you.
4,good.  maybe even gooder.  The Subwoofer leaves an impact and sounds good.  The problem with the PSW10 is that it doesn't support natively a single subwoofer feed -- named *X! .  Sorry I don't know the name but the PSW12 does.  If you want real sound until this one is upgraded buy the PSW12.  shhhhhh this was a gift....
5,Awsome
5,Wow this thing is loud! Just a FYI it doesn't have a subwoofer plug port so you will need an adapter if youre running a subwoofer cable.
5,Much better than I expected from a reasonably priced subwoofer. It handles every thing from smooth jazz to theater productions really nicely.
5,Very good quality.
3,I love this thing but i has quite a bit of port noise when playing R&B or rap music (some techno to). Anything with long heavy bass notes will cause it to have port noise I have to turn the volume down on it. May be just because of its size but it is annoying. Has great punch fro its size and will have no problem filling a moderately sized room. If you have the extra cash to spend I would probably go for the 12in version of this as it shouldn't get the port noise this one does. No port noise when watching movies. Even holds its own when a helicopter is landing on a movie.
4,Solid Sub woofer
5,I recently purchased the Mitsubishi 52" Diamondvision lcd TV.(great tv but buy it from Amazon).  It has a direct 2 prong hook up for a sub woofer.  Plugged this speaker in spent a while adjusting it--great sound.  I didnt really have the desire to put together a surround system so this was absolutely a good alternative.  This sub coupled with the regular tv speakers give great sound.  The auto on off feature makes it easy to use.  I placed it behind my TV--dont even know its there except for the great sound effects.
3,The amp got hot and might've burnt out on me I know I have a warranty how does that work you know I wanna get my subwoofer replaced thanks
5,For the price this can’t be beat. I paired the subwoofer with Edifier bookshelf speakers and the results are pretty amazing. I wanted a simple setup that wasn’t too expensive for my home office and this has worked well.
5,It completed my surround system in finished basement.  It was exactly what I was needing.  It was a really good price fast shipping easy to install.  Plugged in the power cord plugged in the subwoofer cable went into received to turn on the subwoofer and it is rocking the movies.  This week-end will get some tunes and football games to see how they do.  Would purchase again as receiver can handle 2 subwoofers but not sure that it is needed for that.  It is one great subwoofer!
5,Placed this in my roughly 300sf living room fed from a Denon AVR. Gives whatever I'm watching or listening to great presence. The bass hits hard and can rattle the windows on the right title but has never sounded muddy.
5,I bought this product during the black Friday sale for a great deal. It is worth buying if you're sold by name alone.  The set up is simple and the sound is amazing.  I enjoy a little bass in my music but I don't need rattling the floor and tv stand bass.  The Polk subwoofer can blast the bass if you want but I prefer a nice rumble.  It delivers a great tone and nice rumble of bass for music and movie fanatics.  It may be a little pricey but it's worth the extra for quality.
5,I don't know enough about electronics I was tasked to find a new subwoofer for our new stereo system after reading all the reviews I chose this one and all I can say is WOW! What a game changer. It's much more sleek and hot looking than that picture puts out a mean bass sound for music and surround sound. My husband loves it and that's all that matters.
5,Excellent.  And not just excellent for the price this is excellent period.PROS:-It has many connection options to satisfy all kinds of configurations.-I got for $89.99 which is a great price.-Performs great on all my favorite music genres on the highs and lows.-Volume knob is great for manually adjusting the base when your AV receiver is in another room.-With or without the face plate this unit looks great in the corner.  Very well designed.CONS:-None so far.
5,The product arrived on time.This was a replacement for my current subwoofer which started making a crackling noise.This is a high quality product at a small price. There are better more expensive subwoofers ( for the audiophile).If you have small to medium sized room this is the best product at this price (the price was 50% more at a local store).The quality of the sound is excellent and the bass is very deep. If you have a hometheater you need a more expensive subwoofer with larger speakers\.This is excellent for a family room or man cave!
5,i like this Subwoofer going to buy another one sometime soon
5,This is a great sub. Don’t be scared of the price it was originally a 230$ unit which has gradually come down. It gave me a huge bass boost as my JBL Arena 15’s only go down to 100hz. Massive improvement.
5,Solid bass performance in a compact size. Plus it's great looking and solidly constructed!
5,Sounds great
5,Good for the price.
5,I did some research and read lots of reviews on different subwoofers. I decided on the Polk Audio PSW10 10 Inch.And I am totally satisfied. It can be adjusted and tuned. Separate volume on the back. It makes everything sound amazing. From movies to music. I did have to buy a new receiver with HDMI capabilities. I highly recommend this speaker!
5,An awesome woofer! Deep rich bass. Crisp sharp notes.
4,This sub deffinitly Rocks and for the money you can't beat it way more than enough bass for my 16×15 Livingroom
5,What can you say?  Polk Audio produces some of the finest equipment for sound on the market today.  We have a huge great room and once you tune the PSW-10 in the entire room is rocking!
4,This item is third i have had...as you know it is very great and its sound is very nice.....i like it
5,Considering its size this sub handles any range of low end I throw at it without distortion or port noise.I read through all the reviews here and a handful of users reported port noise but the only noise ive had coming from this thing is clean low end awesomeness.for 100 bucks this sub will go toe to toe with any other sub priced at double this ones price.snag one of these while theyre still around.im grabbing my second one soon to complete my 7.2 setup
5,Added this to our 7.2 theater sound system and has all the power we could ever need. I often set the decimal level at only half power and it creates an awesome immersive deep sound. One of the most satisfying parts of our entertainment set up. 5-Stars.
5,Purchased this to replace my Yamaha YST-SW012 8-Inch Front-Firing Active Subwoofer. I assumed this would be a bit better but the improvement is jaw dropping - much cleaner lows much deeper bass. Given they are in the same price point this Polk is a no brainer.
5,Thundering bass for my sound bar! My last sub struggled to not sound distorted on the deep lows and sound like it’s trying too hard when the bass was loud. This one solved all my problems at a great price!
5,I ordered the Polk Audio PSW10 10-inch subwoofer and I am amazed. I have to order an amplifer for my other Polk audio speakers so I connected the subwoofer straight from my tv (subwoofer output) along with my previous surround sound system and wow. The difference between the old sub and this one is like night and day. This is better than going to the movie theater. Now my action movies hit me straight in the chest with bass. For the price this is a great choice for people on a budget but its an excellent addition to any system.
5,This box hits WAY harder than I expected!
4,Nice bass. Not expensive
5,This is an amazing sub!!! I am soooo very happy with it!! I couldn’t decide between a 10 inch or a 12 & I went with the 10 & couldn’t be happier!!! It has plenty of bass for the living room! Would 100% buy again!!
5,This sub-woofer is a great value.  I bought it to replace a dozen year old Polk PSW50.  I am not an audiophile and rarely listen to music with my home theater setup.  When we do have music playing on this system it's usually during the holidays or when entertaining friends so the music quality is not being scrutinized.  For movies this sub gives you the room shaking effects that you expect. For your average home theater enthusiast who is looking for a sub that won't break the bank you can't go wrong with this Polk.
5,Great features for such an amazing value! Wires up simple enough. Using an older model receiver that does not have a dedicated out for a SUB. It was a little bigger than I expected but the sound is great! Filled the void in sound my living room setup was needing.
3,There is a reason this is 99 bucks. Yes it does improve bookshelf speaker sound but its Not any great shakes. I wouldnt have bought ithonestly but I will keep it. You need good speakers to go along with a subwoofer. Dont be mislead. And a good amp or receiver. Any weak linkin your system and it will drag the whole sound down.If you cant have a decent whole audio system then dont spend any money on it.
5,I love bass.  Works great with my Denon receiver.  One can rock the world with this. Good sound quality
5,Sub box was bigger than I anticipated.  Granted I did have the measurements but still was bigger and heavier than I expected.  That aside it packs a heck of a punch.  Rounds out my system perfectly!
5,I haven't entirely set it up or read the manual. But after reading reviews at amazon and searching stores this was a great buy and fit my system perfectly. My subwoofer had gone out and I didn't realize how expensive they were when I went to the store. Since I wasn't ready to make a huge financial commitment this was an easy choice. Especially with the free shipping. Really happy. Plugged it in and i got my thunder. When I actually calibrate it to my receiver and surround sound I'm sure I'll be even happier for the cost.
5,Great sound for the price but because the product is old the connections available for the sub are a little dated.  So make sure you look at the configuration of your receiver before purchasing so you know what type of cables are needed and available for the sub.  You need the red/white cables to hook this up (other options too) appropriating as there isn't HDMI or the mono hook up like some of the newer subwoofers have.  So check out the details of the sub and your receiver to make sure they are compatible.
5,Very much a surprise at this price point.  Sounds great with an old set of Polk audio speakers.
4,Really good sub for the money...just not great.  Certainly adds value to the listening experience and I have had no issues with t.
4,I was daydreaming when I ordered this.  The speaker cone is 10" across.  The unit itself is about 14x14x18....it just fit where I needed it to go.I found the base intensity nob a little sensitive.  Ended up turning it to max and backing off about a quarter a turn.Good for the price....less expensive than buying the electronics for my previous one that had gone caput.
5,I've been looking for a new sub for awhile and couldn't believe when Amazon has it on sales at just $99 when Best Buy is still selling at $199.99.  Better yet I ordered on May 20th with free super saver shipping and yet it arrived just 2 days later on today the 22nd.The sub is simple looking but that's a good thing as I do not want the sub to stand out.  Set up is simple and the sound is rich.  For $99 you just can't get a better deal than this!!!
5,Fills out the sound in my living room. Not muddy. Surprisingly high quality for the price. As long as you're not looking to REALLY rock the house pull the trigger on this. That's coming from a guy with a dedicated theater room with a 7.2 speaker system that has 2 x 1000 watt subs.
5,I am not using this as my main channel subwoofer but rather as a booster for my rear speakers. This works well and allows me to reclassify me rear speakers as "large". I use the Polk Audio PSW15 as my main channel booster and the combination works great. The price on Amazon for this speaker was excellent.
5,Have had it for more than 2 months now has been holding up well and has a nice punch to it. Nothing crazy but it will get the job done and it has the capacity to irritate your neighbors if theyre close enough. I cranked it and walked across the street and could hear it from there. I personally thought it was worth the buy.
5,Added to theater system completely satisfied !!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Hard to go wrong here for $100 bucks. Sound is good quality is good the packaging was great and it looks good.
5,For 100 bucks I wasn't expecting the booming base that comes from this evening though it is a polk speaker.  I bought it for more bass for the TV and am totally happy with it .....my living room is about 10 by 15.  And it fills the room with its volume? Or sensitivity? Level at about 30 percent.  My opinion great purchase
5,Goes good with my LG home Theater sound systemWith the T-50
5,If you're looking for an affordable sub that performs well for a decent surround sound setup this is a great option.  You won't find a better quality product in this price range.  It definitely has plenty of power for my system which includes an Optimus center channel and rear speaker and large three-way front channels.  The auto on feature seems to kick in quickly enough that I don't notice a delay if I'm not looking for it.  Bottom line if you're not a finicky high-end surround sound connoisseur this should be what you need.
5,Yeah I got two of these Pope audio 10in subs I have a onkyo audio receiver 8 speakers to it 2 subwoofers  I would tell anybody to get this sub cuz they are great subwoofers..... and I have a 65" Samsung 4K TV to go along with it......  I'll be basing out down here
4,Added much needed bass to a very underpowered stereo I had bought.Just make sure you understand how big it is as it needs a big space on floor.  Not a hidden sub by any means.
4,Hooked up to up to my Vizio sound bar. I cannot say that I know much about anything relating to boominess or muffled sound.... But for a novice I think it sounds great!  It blends well with what I have at any level/strength of bass.
5,I previously had an infinity sub that has been going bad for years and it cost much more than this one did so one can understand why I might have been skeptical of the purchase.  I can say without doubt that it was worth the 100 bucks I paid for it.  My room is about 12x20.  If is going in a room bigger than that I can't say but I know in my house it has the walls rumbling.
5,Great subwoofer! Sounds terrific.  Running off of the pre-sub on my TX-NR636 onkyo.  This thing is knocking pictures off the walls at 50%. I love it.
4,excellent subwoofer with great frequency response. It fits into my set up quite well and is great value for money. Only downside is that amazon reduced the price by 30 dollars after I purchased it. Not too happy about that.
4,good cheap sub for my surround setup. glad to add it in and finally get the full sound that was intended for the audience to hear
5,I purchased this sub to replace a Sony 10” powered sub in the living room.  This is a great buy and much better than the Sony in terms of the range of bass and volume of bass.  Highly recommend!!!
4,You can’t beat the quality of this sub for this price!! Best thing I’ve bought in a long time.
3,For the short time I owned this sub i was not too impressed with its performance. If you are a very critical listener like myself you will be less than satisfied with its performance at higher volumes with music. Don’t even get me started on the port noise in the lower frequency spectrum. I was however impressed how well it performs above 40 hz and low to moderate volume especially considering its low 50w RMS rating.
4,This is a great sub for my 14x 24' room I would like it even more if it had more power. But works great for what it cost. Thanks Amazon for selling it and getting it here so fast. Its always nice to save money and still be very happy. polk makes make very good speakers and now I'll say there sub are good to  even there least costly one
4,Plenty of punch.
5,I've been using this in my home office which also doubles as my secondary home theater room.  I play music while I'm working and then later will switch over to home theater when I want to stream Netflix without bothering my wife.  This sub performs great in both situations.  It doesn't perform as well as my main home theater Velodyne sub - but this sub is only 1/3 the price of the Velodyne.  I highly recommend the PSW10 for low-budget music and/or home theater setups.
4,Had to replace a blown woofer for home audio system. The price is right and the Polk woofer did the trick.
5,Good solid performer for very little cash outlay you can do better but it will cost you quite a bit more or you can do like me and purchase two of them now I have great bass everywhere in the room I got them on sale at 79 each shipped the two of them together at 160 bucks is room shaking I don't think you buy another sub for less than 200 can come anywhere near what two of these can do.  I am very happy and some extra cash left for movies and popcorn!!! 5 stars
5,really nice bass for the price. I was in the shower while movie was on fairly low volume and I could hear all the lows across the house over the running water was suprised.  one note. this thing is huge. not a problem but guess i should have read the dimensions.
5,I have another Polk subwoofer that I got as part of a speaker set and I assumed this one would be similar.  But it's much better.  It puts out lower frequencies and is quite clear.  Even on a concrete floor 15 feet away I can feel the bass in my body.  Recommended.
5,It looks good!  It sounds good!  It is good!Just make sure you take the time to adjust the settings.  People who complain of boominess or muddy bass will usually have their settings wrong.  Usually too loud too.  Use your receiver to set your crossover frequency.  You'll first have to find out the frequency response of your main speakers and go from there.  Your subwoofer volume should never have to go more than half.With the right settings this thing rocks.
5,This is my first Sub on my entertainment center and I must say this speaker has amazing sound. The rumble is defined and strong at the same time. Explosions are vivid and clear. I counldn't be happier. The price of $100 was a steal compared to the local Best Buy and CompUsa. I am very satisfied with this purchase. If you are in the market for a Subwoofer that is economic and you want to add that extra punch to you movies you can't go wrong with this Polk Audio Sub. I love the Auto "On" feature.
5,Can't beat this sub for the price....nowhere.  Kicks arse.
5,Awesome. I’m very picky. Was reluctant to buy. I have bose shelf speakers and never used subwoofer because they have base. This is amazing. Incredible for football movies and PS4 is unbelievable with sound. Recommended. Kind of large but out in corner. Worth it
5,matches my other POLK speakers  finish wood.
5,Awesome sub! Sounds great and no background noise just deep crisp bass!
5,It's 100 sub. At times I get disappointed because it sounds sloppy at higher volumes but then I remember I only paid 100 for it and it sits in my teenager's room. So rating it for what it is it's easily a 5-star purchase.
5,I own a Yamaha sound bar and this subwoofer is the perfect compliment! It took my movie experience from good to great adding the deep rich bass I was accustomed to hearing (and feeling) in the movie theaters. I didn't know how much I was missing until this sub was installed and now i can't imagine watching a football game or movie without it. What I am most happy about is the performance relative to the cash I had to spend. The sub cost less than $100 bringing the total cost for my home audio system to less than $300.
4,i tested it out with my inwall pok speakers coupled with an onkyo nr626 receiver. i watched interstellar trailer as i hear it has some of the best sound ranges. i am absolutely not disappointed.  please note i have only used it once.  the media room i am building is still under construction
4,Sounds great.  Hook up for a amp with a dedicated output for sub-woofer was a little confusing but once I got it right it works great.
5,I have had some bad luck with Subwoofers and after mine died recently I purchased this one.  Sounds great and you cannot beat the price especially considering the speaker size.
5,I have a what I consider to be a high quality a/v receiver. Onkyo tz rx810. 2 t-50 Polk fronts & t-30 center. The psw 10 seems to be a great match  I’d highly recommend it.
5,I'm using this with an Onkyo TR-606 alongside a Toshiba 62" DLP HDTV and a full set of Polk speakers and the sound quality is remarkable.The only caveat is that the subwoofer input has two connectors but you really only need to connect one of them.  The manual is far from clear about this and plenty of people will probably spend extra on a Y cable or worse yet put in an adapter which will add both cost and loss of fidelity.  But just connecting to the left input works fine.  Subwoofers are mono anyway and the double inputs are primarily there to make certain wiring configurations easier not to add more sound fidelity.
4,AN OK entry level sub. I get distortion and cone waffling at 100MHz when driving the speakers at a moderate volume. I set the cross over to its lowest setting (80 MHz) and things are a bit better but I wanted more pop w/o distortion. All that said its a solid performer if you don't blast your sound + it can be adjusted to avoid distortion for bass heavy tracks.
5,Nothing to dislike about this product I bought it to set up to the same Polk Audio subwoofers and they sound great although I don't think the neighbors like it much haha
5,i purchased this last year and have it setup in our open floor plan living area.  i actually had to turn down the bass as it has so much power that you could feel it in the bedroom.  It looks good as a table between 2 chairs.
4,Listening to movies
5,Polk audio psw 10 subwoofer. I have had the sub for 2 months and has performed faultlessly for $90 (including s&h). This subwoofer needs a coax sub splitter that you will need to buy also but it is an amazing item. I would recomend it for a mid sized to small sized family room. It hits low notes great unless you plan to shake the whole house and neighbors. Movies/games 80%  -  music 20%. Best 10" sub for the money. In the furnished basement room (14ftx22ft) this subwoofer rarely gets turned up past 60% volume.
4,After reading reviews.  I was sure I got the best bang for my buck. I was a little disappointed.  I put in my head it would hit  hard and clean at high volume. Movies YES what I was thinking. Music on the other hand not so much. I didnt want to crank it to show it off.
4,This subwoofer is pretty rocking! It's very good for it's price! It packs quite the punch. Very good sound quality though I must admit not the BESTl It does the job really well though. Higher end and REALLY lower end bass notes are a LITTLE weak but unless you're a music major (like I am) it really doesn't matter too much! I highly reccomend this for a cheap sub!
5,I have this plugged into my Klipsch speakers and the remote controls both. Works great at low levels and the police will visit at higher levels
4,Polk PSW-10 provides subtle but rich audio. Definitely improving the full spectrum without bouncing the walls!
5,Replaced my older sony sub with this Polk subwoofer and all I can say is WOW!  I know some are giving this average reviews but if your not a expert and you just want great sound while watching movies and nice bass listening to music then this is the one for you. Great price  great sound! Buy this one and feel the walls rumble. I am now a Polk fan and will always check out Polk first for any sound purchase.
4,Does exactly what I want it to and has all the bells and whistles I would want in a sub but it does sound a bit... muddy. Had I done my research before purchasing I probably would have gone with the Dayton Sub-800 but this certainly isn't bad as a budget sub.
3,Eh this thing isn't anything to write home about. It's my rear sub as part of my 7.2 surround sound system and anything more than low volume bass and this thing sounds awful. My old 12" and 18 year old Polk sub in the front clearly outperforms it still after nearly 2 decades of use. If you have a very low expectation and looking to not spend a lot this might do. Anything more than that and you might be disappointed.
5,This is such a great product.  It adds so much to my TV time.  Movies come to life with the rumbling of thunder alien attacks or any other action scene.  Pair it with a sound bar and you're in business.  This may be the best thing I've ever ordered.
5,I added to this to my stereo which is the Tivoli Model Two. I cannot believe how much this sub brings out the sound of these speakers. I'm hearing things in my music I've never heard before. I highly recommend this product.
5,Awesome piece of equipment. When I first received the sub I was very unhappy with its sound because it would seem to rattle if turned up past mid volume. I have since taken the dust cover off the sub and it's sound quality has improved exponentially. It's currently being used this in a dorm which makes it loud enough to shake the beds of the rooms surrounding me. Can't tell you how much satisfaction I get from listening to this thing thump.
5,Wow! That's all I can say. I can't get into all of the technical stuff like the other reviewers because I don't know what any of that means. However I do know what sounds good and this sucker sounds awesome! I upgraded my 8 inch subwoofer for my home theater room with this and it is POWERFUL! I can't turn the volume up even halfway because it makes my windows rattle.  I've listened to music and watched movies with it and it is amazing!
4,Good for low to medium high  listening levels but if you really wanna spend hundreds more go ahead cause you can buy the best then do it. but these will do fine for the average person . You must tune them just right for your listening needs  and they do not sound that bad at all good especially  with a 5.1 or 7.1 surround system .
5,If you don't have a sub this is the best deal out there. Polk makes very good speakers.50 watts may not sound like a lot but it's more than adequate for the average application.If you're trying to fill a 1000 sq ft room or you like to listen to audio near the level of pain ....go with something more powerful.
4,Rich tones good volume still haven't figured out quit the optimal way to place this or direct its sound.  With a higher quality enclosure than my last sub it's not as simple as "Stick it anywhere and it will sound the same."
5,This has a lot of power. We ended up having to turn it down quite a bit. It is nice to know that if we ever need more bass or set it up in a larger room it will be more than enough power.
5,This is a great Sub and great deal. Best Buy was selling this type of sub for at least double the price. The sound is great and it was easy to hook up. We hooked it up to an Insignia receiver and has really worked out for us. Its very nice quality well made and looks modern and updated.
5,I have used this for over 2 years now. Its performance has been incredible from the beginning. It's my first powered sub and I have no desire to upgrade it provides plenty of bass notes and thumps for movies and gaming.
5,This is not a Bose-level speaker.  I know because I had one.  But given the price this is a GREAT little woofer.  Hooked it up to my Vizio soundbar for my TV and I am a happy camper.
4,This was to replace an old sub-woofer that was part of my previous surround sound system.  The Polk was easy to install in a new Yahama receiver system.  The bass is more subtle not as booming as the old one but it's solidly there.  I am pleased with it and unless you are after a booming loud bass that overwhelms the sound you'll like it too.
4,this sub is so loud that i rarely turn it on when i'm watching television (don't want my neighbors to call the cops). the sound quality is excellent; just wish it were a little more compact as i'm not a fan of big heavy audio equipment all over my living room but if you don't mind that and have the space it is worth it.
5,I had the big brother the PSW110 and it failed ( had it a long time). Found out I really didn't need the big brother because this one seems to be more in sync with all my speakers and JVC Receiver. GREAT response and sound. Just read the instructions; the worse thing you will need is a y adapter (Radio Shack 5 bucks).
1,Worked for about 2 weeks. When you call to get help they don't care!
5,Comes with a cover that snaps on and off which is not shown in the main image. it snaps on and the sub is powerful enough to push the cover off of the speaker. Quite possibly the best $100 I have ever spent?
5,Really pretty great for the price. I have a high end Definitive setup for my home theater system and use this puppy for my computer set up paired with M-Audio AV 40sCannot tell ya how awesome this setup sounds - set it to 60-80% volume with frequency at around 85 Hz .. sit back and enjoy. Comparing to my higher end far pricier Definitive sub the bass may not be as tight or punchy but this is one heck of a deal. Certainly recommended.
4,Exactly what I wanted. There are enough reviews from users who write as experts in audio yet have bought one of the cheapest subwoofers available. Everything you'd want in a $100 subwoofer and more. Movies & Music sound great.
4,Outstanding sub for the price! Very tight low end for any system.  Would be hard to find a better value 10" sub.
5,I have 3 in the house; two as part of 5.1 systems one as part of 2.1 system. Bass and power handling are good connection options very good. Units are reasonably attractive and reasonably priced. On sale they become even more attractive...and I have purchased them on sale twice.
5,Great speaker and a reasonable price. It sounds better than the JBL we used to have.
3,I purchased this sub to complete my stereo set up and did not really know much about stereo/home theater systems before I decided to purchase one. At first I was pretty impressed by this relatively inexpensive product but as I continued to experiment with different songs on this I became more and more disappointed with my purchase. Songs like Day N Nite and Rack City would produce a terrible rattling noise that made me not even want to put those songs on. Also I heard this noise while listening to a movie using my set up. Long story short I learned that this sub does not produce tight bass like I wanted so I exchanged it for the PSW 110. This might not be much better but it was only 35$ more so it was worth a try!!
4,good quality.
5,I used it for TV sound bar
5,Matched with a Sony 5.1 receiver for a surround sound system. Easy setup and great sound for me. Very happy!
4,Nice little sub! Complements my bookshelf speakers well. Good bassnice response. And the auto on feature works very well. For 99 bucks you're not gonna find a better sub powered sub that is
5,Awesome sub to round out my Polk Audio surround sound! Paired it with the TSi200 bookshelf speakers and CS10 center channel and couldn’t be happier! Just make sure you have a powerful enough receiver to push the sub. My Denon AVR-S730H does an amazing job!
4,Good for the price 👍
5,Great product for this price point. A must have for those lows you need to watch movies in 5:1. I would highly recommend this product. Installation is very easy just an RCA cable from your amplifier. Not suggested for a small apartment use wisely.The floor and my furniture were vibrating at just half the power from the amplifier.Try watch Top Gun or something similar you will be impressed. Amazon  has  greatdelivery timeon time 99.9% of the time. Glad I became a prime member well worth the membership fee for faster shipping time and movies.
4,Fired the fuse when first connected to the power outlet I replaced the fuse and it works greate.
5,Great sub for the price highly recommended if you are looking for the best bang for the buck.
5,Easy set up easy operation and my neighbors hate me. I love it!!
5,As impressive as everyone is saying. I have old subwoofers without the auto-on feature so wanted to upgrade. What a great sub for the price. 8 inch subs are OK but if you want seriously deep bass you have to go with a 10 inch or more. Very impressive sub at a killer price. Buy it.
5,Very good subwoofer for use on a 2.1 system for a PC. Compliments bookshelf speakers very well.
5,I'm completely amazed of how loud this sub really! I'm using it right now for a gaming sound system and this things bumps! Simple aux cord with female and male ends from the TV to this sub and I love it!
5,I had just installed a new audio system. I needed a powered sub. But after all the money I spent I needed something good but cheap. This sub fits the bill and then some. At half power it's great. Turn it up a bit and it shakes the house! Only wish I had a 7.2 system!
5,Great subwoofer! Easily fills the room with bass. I've been using this sub for a few weeks now and it is breaking in nicely. I'm using it for a home theatre set-up connected to a Sony STR-DE575 receiver.Please note this sub DOES NOT include an RCA cable for input. I picked up a Y-splitter RCA cable since my receiver outputs a mono subwoofer channel.
5,This subwoofer is just what my soundbar needed. Easy to set up and works like a charm!
5,Got it for my new 9.1 home theater system. Did not know what expect. I was very surprised just how much low end I had been missing. It pair very well with the T50s and the in ceiling surround speakers.
5,Added it to some Klipsh computer speakers for a small room surround sound and it is very listenable. I don't run it that much so I appreciate the auto on feature when signal is detected. (goes on standby a while after you stop listening)
5,I really like this subwoofer. It has decent response and can get plenty loud. It's not the best for under 40hz but is just fine for casual listening/movies/television/gaming. Good performance for the price. Great addition to my 2 tower speaker setup.
3,When I first turned the PSW10 on the sound to me was not quite right. The port seamed to be to large which made the woofer too lose .What I did was to make port smaller by installing a short paint roller wrapped in three inch sound proof installation.To my ears the was much improved. I also turned down the volume on the sub to bring  it more in line with my main speakers
5,Wow glad I didn't get the 12". Plenty of bass for movies and music.We listen to rock blues americana country classical. Fantastic add on to smaller systems at the very least.Do take some time to adjust the settings along with your stereo receiver to get it just right.
5,Can't beat it for the price
5,Play the original Jurassic Park with this subwoofer. When the T-Rex roars you get goose bumps!
5,Set this Sub up right and it will do it's job. It's a great Sub for a small to medium-sized room. It's very easy to overdrive a Sub it's easier than you think. I have had in the pass much Higher end Subs than this but I also have had these too in the pass 3 of them. Polk Audio has been around for decades very good products and they back them up with great customer service. I do recommended this Sub for a low-budget system it will perform well if set up right.
5,EXECELLENT SOUND QUALITY. I am a Jamaican so my (reggae) music is dominated by a deep bass line. This sub woofer does the job very well with no humming that I use to hear from the bass box I had before
5,i would rate this a 10 if i could this speaker literally shakes the windows and its not an old house... i keep mine on like 4 because it over powers my tv the people that rate this low either are deaf or want something you can feel in your  chest. i had the speaker about halfway up and it knocked things off my TV stand it is awesome to play COD or watch movies with. its a must have for home theater and i had no issues with the front grill being broken
5,Bought this years ago sounds as good today as then ...
5,Great little subwoofer for the price. Got it hooked up and running in a matter of minutes with the Mediabridge Y-cable. Provides very nice but not overpowering bass. I use it primarily while watching it for TV either satellite or streaming TV. I do not use it as much for music but when I have it again provides some nice depth but isn't overpowering. It really fits my needs and got it for a great price. Recommended.
5,The sound coming from this baby right here is incredible! My house is 20feet from my next door neighbor and at 70% volumehe felt the bass from my movie room inside his home. Well worth the money
5,all you'll need... solid an reliable this is a 2nd add to the 1st one
4,I bought the sub woofer to accompany my Vizio Sound Bar. It sounds good! Watching movies is great with the Subwoofer. I bought my Subwoofer a few years ago. I wrote a positive review when I originally purchased it but it disappeared. I don't have any complaints.
5,Well its now even $10 cheaper then when I got it a few weeks ago. For the price you can't go wrong. I bought it to hook up to my computer and it sounds great! It also will probably do good in a home theater setup but it won't go as low as 12" sub. I went with the Polk 505 12" for my home theater and that thing will bring the house down. Again for the price though this is a great sub. I give this five stars for best bang for your money.
5,Very loud and crisp. Also very large. I did not expect this unit to be as big as it is. I could not be happier in it's sound quality. I have it in my office and it works perfectly. I might be concerned with the quality in a bigger room though. But for small to mid rooms it sounds amazing
4,Connected to my Denon receiver just fine.  Provides great bass response and makes the action come alive without being annoying.
4,Good for movies and video games. not the best subwoofer but its best for its price range
5,Awesome bass for the money. I use it outside under a lanai (keep it stored in a cabinet) and at half volume it rocks. People think it’s thundering :-) this bad boy could do some damage if placed in a home and turned up.
5,This is one of the best values I have ever come across. The polk psw10 will not let you down. I was so amazed at the performance of the first one I got that I have added two more to my sound system and may add one more so as to have two in two corners of my living room. What can I say one will do the job but I like big bass all over the room. Do not let the size and wattage fool you it will amaze you.JerryBainbridgeGa.
5,I have to admit that I was one of those people that read about 200 hundred reviews before I decided on the PSW10.I am glad I did it sounds really nice... good depth and nice pop/boom for the money (and I would pay a lot more for this knowing what I know now). Now I have an enclosed media room with no windows and the sound is brilliant. If you looking for a cheap sub you got one here that is worth it. All these people are really being honest.Maybe this helps maybe not but if I took the time to write a review... I REALLY LIKED IT!!!!
3,I get different results from the speaker depending what the output is. If I'm using my TV it sounds good with no distortion or vibration. If I use Roku I get a buzzing vibration with heavy bass. When I use DVD I don't get as much bass as I'd like. All devices are fed by the same tuner and amp. I contacted Polk Audio and was told that I must use 2 cables from the amp. I hooked up another cable and there was improvement but I still have the same issues as listed above.
5,When purchasing this sub I read the reviews and they left me a little wary that it wasn't going to work well for my application.  In the end I decided to purchase this item and hooked it up to my new surround sound receiver.  It took some tweaking but I LOVE THIS SUB!!!  It sounds great with movies and music alike.  The bass makes you feel like you're in the action.  There are better subs out there but you aren't likely to find one in this price range.
5,adds much more bass to music  works well.
4,I bought this sub after purchasing some Polk bookshelf speakers and felt the system needed to be rounded out. I have found at this pricepoint hearing other's systems that this sub is a winner in terms of musical reproduction but is lacking in the more powerful realm of home cinema. Nonetheless as with many Polk products the quality is top notch not boomy accurate and I hope shall last.
5,I purchased the equivalent to this model 14 years ago. It gave me years of low end pleasure and worked like a champ... Until it didn't anymore. :-(I saw the psw10 and purchased it right away. Less than a week later my movies were once again filling my living room with thunderous bottom end bass!! For the money and for the space and rated power you absolutely cannot beat this subwoofer!!! Highly highly recommended!
5,Great sub for the price ... pair this with a set of $150 Klipsch bookshelf speakers and you've got a speaker system for $250 that will hold it's own against virtually anything.  I've actually tried it with a pair of   Dual LU43PW 100 Watt 3-way Indoor/Outdoor Speakers in White (Pair)         that are $35 and that makes for an excellent sound system for around $150 can't beat it.
5,This sub offers deep bass sound. I added it to my Bose 660 sound system with a 5.2 Onkyo receiver. I was thinking of upgrading the center speaker but the boom sound of the bass was all that was missing. The mids and highs seem to jump out of the mix now that the bottom end dominates. Love the improved sound over the standard Bose sub! It transformed my home stereo into a true theater experience.
5,This sub works very well. It's enough to give you some good vibes but not too much to rattle your neighbor. There are plenty of adjustments to really tune it to your liking. Plus it's really cheap for what you get. (Except the cherry version. That one is ridiculously expensive for what I am assuming is laminate.)Edit: The cherry model is now at a norma price. It was like over $200 when I ordered my black one.
5,Using in up-stairs living room with an Onkyo TX-8020 2 channel Stereo Receiver and a pair of Klipsch speakers from a 2.1 system.  HOLY CRAP IT POUNDS!!!. Very nice system.
5,The 10” exceeded my expectations.
5,I love this sub. Well constructed with awesome sound quality. I have a pair of these subs and they just bring music and movies to life.  For an experience of a lifetime grab one of these subwoofers.
5,Works very well with Polk TSi 200 speakers.  At first there was almost no sound from it but after a few hours of use it's well broken-in.EDIT - The small hard plastic feet on the bottom of this sub cause the bass to be transmitted directly to the floor below with annoying results! I removed them (they are just nailed on) and replaced with stick-on Sorbothane hemispheres (1.5" ones are good they will support the weight).  Now I can crank the bass but downstairs they can barely hear it.
4,I like the performance of this subwoofer and I like its appearance as well as the simple installation. Bright LED can be annoying so recommend against a wall or in the corner to hide the LED. My only complaint is that I had to add the bulk of a RCA splitter because the panel does not have a LFE input.
5,I love this sub it brings some serious sounds that rock the movies and music I'm playing.
5,Great sound at an extremely affordable price. It really transformed my surround sound system into an impressive movie watching experience. I have slowly pieced my system together and this was the proverbial cherry on top. I'm by no means an audiophile but do enjoy a certain level of quality from my sound system. It's not just movies that have been enhanced but my records and CDs sound great with it as well.
5,Ok so first off I wasn’t expecting much from this due to the watts and the price... but DAMN!!!! It’s almost too much for just a game room. This thing will easily complete with all the 1000+ options out there! Don’t waste your money are them. Get this!!!!
5,This subwoofer has a standby mode that powers off the built- in amp after 15 minutes of no signal activity. This sub kicks for it's size. Well built & well worth the money.. PS it is a 2 channel RCA connectors in the back. If you have a sound bar with a single sub output..you need a y type RCA cable like Media Bridge Ultra Series RCA Y Adapter cable. Sounds great.
5,There are better woofers and there are worse woofers. I think you really get your moneys worth with this one. I really like watching and hearing stuff blow up in movies with this baby.
5,Wow! I purchased this sub expecting mediocre bass but I was wrong! Boom Boom Pow! I've had subs far more expensive that can't touch this Polk. I must advise though to reach full potential of this sub don't use the sub coax cable instead use 10 gauge speaker wire. The difference in bass will shock you. Many of previous poor reviews I'm sure are using coax cable. I'm purchasing a second one for the man cave! Boom Boom Pow!!!
4,Sounds great hits hard. The only problem is is does not shut off on its own even with the switch set to auto. Not a big deal but that is the only reason not 5 out of 5 for me.  I am using this with a Onkyo TX-SR505
5,I got this to go with a new surround system I'd built up.It's well made and well packaged.It's also BIG!  Much bigger than I thought it would be.  So big my young kids sit on it sometimes.It's inputs are flexible and the volume seems more than adequate to shake our 20'x30' open plan room.
5,The Polk PSW10 provides plenty of deep bass and works easily with many products.  If you have a sound bar and are looking for extra bass this product will provide plenty.  Adding this to a home theater system is also very easy and provides more bass then you will ever need.  What this means is the product should last for a long time because it will not be overused.  I am very happy with the purchase and hope to use the product for many years. Great investment so far.
4,Bought this for my parents and for their needs it works great. It is nothing compared to the Polk Audio PSW111 Subwoofer which I have in my home BUT for the price of $99 it's a great unit. My parents living room is rather large as well so it's cranked up pretty high. Again based on pricing you are getting exactly what you are paying for.
5,I wanted a subwoofer for my dorm room in college and man did I get one... I use the sub mostly for my music but I also have used it for movies and everyday television. It sounds great when I hook it up with my sound bar. The bass really kicks with this thing when you turn it up! I do turn it down for movies and regular television as well. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a versatile subwoofer that can get the job done on just about any platform.
5,I placed this at my master bed and the bass sure take me to the heaven 👍
5,This sub sounds awesome. Can get very loud if you want it to. We compared this to my roommate's 12" sub and my 10" sounded equal or better than his 12.
5,I was happy to get this to put with my office stereo. I have two bookshelf polks with a nice center polk and a couple floor sonys hooked into a sony 500w receiver. I am glad I did not go with the 12" sub. This is way enough punch for my needs almost too big. Good sub for any occasion. one... thing though you need to get a slitter at radio shack for it to work as it requires two rca imputs left and right not the one I am used to seeing.
5,At 50% this shakes my entire house and adds the bottom end to the music I was missing.  My old subwoofer from a 5.1 set mysteriously stopped working and I needed a replacement that allowed me to connect the front speakers in and out.  This fit the bill was inexpensive and - most importantly - sounds great!
1,If this product is plugged into the wall it will hum. You can hear it from 15 ft away. Doesn't matter if it's off doesn't matter if it's connected to anything. If it's plugged in it hums constantly. Cheap power supply. Bought the same model 7 years ago for a different home theater and never had a problem with it. Seems like build quality has gone down.
5,Good sub
5,I picked this up when it was on sale for $70! What a steal!!! Sturdy construction. Good electronics. Great sound! An easy way to add low end to me system! I also have a Monoprice 8" sub that was about the same price and the Polk is better by far. Sound is tighter connections are better crossover is better auto off/on works like a charm!This would be a good buy at its regular amazon price of $100-$120 but at $70 it was a steal!!!Thanks Amazon & Polk!!!
5,This subwoofer gives great sound especially for the price. Can't go wrong
5,I'm new to this home-theater system process so when I bought my Fluance AVHTB 5 surround speaker system it was recommended that I purchase a subwoofer. After reading a few reviews I decided to purchse the Polk PWS10 10-Inch subwoofer. Let me tell you what a surprise; for $90 it was worth it!  This small subwoofer is impressive the power and bass it puts out just compliments my speaker system. I definity would recommend this subwoofer for anyone who is just starting out in wanting to enjoy the music and home-theater experience.
5,So good I bought 2 lol hooked 1 to each channel 🤘
4,I paired this sub with two Sony SS-B1000's to replace two ancient 12" 3-ways that died in a move.  I tried to use the RCA input first but found that the speaker inputs worked better with my equipment.  I use this system to listen to classical music mostly and this speaker opens out the low end very nicely in the space I have.
5,satisfied purchase. I received it here in S. Korea via freight forward. I connected my Blutooth Adapter's 2RCA output to 2RCA input of PSW 10 and Blutooth Adapter's 3.5mm output to 2RCA input of my Mackie CR4 Monitor. works good.
5,Very high “quality to price” ratio - excellent value. Well constructed. Nice finish. Easy install. Fast shipping.
5,best $100 sub you can buy. most other $100 subs are 8" subs and this one is 10" and is nice and heavy which i believe means it's got a good sized magnet which translates into deeper bass.also for those that have carpet - this one is the one to get b/c it does't fire into the ground like some subs do. if you have carpet have a down-firing sub tends to have the bass a little muted by the carpet. this one fires directly forward so it doesn't have that problem.
3,This subwoofer sound pretty good with most movies and music.  The reason I gave it a 3 star was because it produced a disturbing rattling distorted sound on some movies that used a lot of lfe like the hunger games bluray and even finding nemo blu ray.  The ratttle was very disturbing and completely took me out of the movie experience.  I'm going to try spending a little more money and getting the BIC f12.  It's supposed to handle low frequencies a lot better.  But it does cost twice as much.  So if you're looking for clean base on intense action movies with a lot of lfe I would steer clear of this subwoofer.
5,this is impressive for the price and a basic box produces nice lows . this rattles the S H I T on my walls and inside my friend  at least he claims along with jealousy.
5,I got 2 but this works so well 1 would have been more than enough as I have the volume on it at 10% for movies and 50% for music. It could have amplified my other speakers too if I didn’t have a receiver.
5,EZ Set Up////Bass 4Rokutv
5,Really added thump to my system.  I had an 8" sub alone and now I have the 8" set to higher frequencies and set this to lower frequencies.  Amazing sound for the price.
5,For a home theater system this subwoofer releases the perfect amount of base but does not overwhelm the room with too much bass. It’s crisp and clean if you adjusted properly. I highly recommend this unit. It makes movie watching so much more enjoyable!
5,I was impressed with the quality!
3,As far as powered subwoofers go this subwoofer is highly underpowered and in all but the smallest rooms and offices it will find itself struggling to be heard. For the price point however it is not out of place. All things considered you would be close to doubling the price to get something substantially better. Make a choice on what your expectations are and if you are looking for that powerful bass kick then you may want to save a bit more to get something of substantially more power.
5,I just purchased this subwoofer and man I am impressed! Music movies and games (Call of Duty) all sound great. For those concerned about no LFE input don't be. Just run the cable from your receiver into either the left or right RCA input (subwoofers are mono anyway) and set the low pass filter all the way to the right. This essentially creates an LFE input. Sit back relax and enjoy the rich clear bass!
3,It’s awesome helps any sound system. when reaching max base sound quality is poor. Just keep it where it sounds great you will still enjoy it.
5,We actually experienced an earthquake the weekend after I got this set up.  I honestly mistook the rattlings in the house for the subwoofer!  I was that impressed by it the whole time!Seriously the bass can now be felt.  Blu-Ray HD movies and even just the music channels piped thru the cable box... everything sounds so much better!  Paired up with a decent center channel speaker two new-ish Polk Audio bookshelf speakers and our two old 'tall' speakers... the system is now 'complete' and sounds great!
5,So far I have been very impressed by the sound quality of this sub. It's not for super hard hitting bass but the quality for surround sound is excellent! This at a great price point at $89.
5,This is an amazing device.  We've had it for a few weeks.  The sound it provides is absolutely amazing.  Our old Panasonic sub that came with our surround system did a great job.  We had no idea how much better this Polk Audio sub would be.  Wow!  It's just amazing!
5,If you are looking for a sub in a bedroomofficecollegebathroom.... than this will do just fine. I've matched this sub with a Yamaha Soundbar in my bedroom and it sounds goodit is just what the doctor ordered. For true dynamic home theater please don't be cheap..... look for a more dynamic sub!. A good sub will make or break a hometheater. spend half of your speaker budget on a good sub for hometheater. I think after the TV and the center channel speaker the sub should get the $$$$ priority.
5,Okay its not a servo controlled 18" sub with a high current 600 watt amp. It also doesn't cost $6000. For under a hundred bucks delivered to your door this little beast will slam a small room with bass that is more accurate than I expected. Volume is best at maybe 1/4 to 1/2 for clean sounds. In my 14'x16' bedroom that level slams me with some nice midbass and throws out a few subharmonics. Its not gonna play down to 20hz with any authority. Mates very well with larger bookshelves.
5,Polk makes great compnents! The PSW10 will fill a very large room with tremendous bass.
5,I purchased this sub after doing a bunch of research on Amazon and a couple of different sites.  For the price ($100) and free shipping it is absolutely worth it.  I was stuck between a 1200 watt 15 inch sub and the Polk.  The other one is on amazon somewhere but the reviews just made me too nervous to buy it.  I'm glad I went this route. It sounds great with Battlefield: Bad Company 2!  Music and movies too.  Hope this review helps a little.
4,Bought this several years ago and use it in my beedroom home theater. Daily use and still works awesome.
5,The bass is great but I had to turn it down to hear them talk overall great subwoofer
5,I just received and set up the Subwoofer I don't believe how awesome it sounds. I had a Sony Home Theater the console took a turn. So I got a Receiver and had to buy this Powered Subwoofer again for the price.. it literately shakes my whole house! I had to tone it down about half ways.
5,These BANG‼️‼️‼️ Just wish these made it with a remote have switch on and off which I use with theater system so pain in butt but sound is worth it.
5,Excellent strong bass without distortion and at only 50W it still fills the room with enjoyable sound that does not “boom” and distort like so many subwoofers I’ve used. It should go without saying that at a $90-100 price-tag you really can’t beat it.
5,I bought a receiver with 2 sub outputs bc i didn't know if this would be enough. I had to turn it down a lot bc i was worried the vibrations would get to the neighbors. And I live in a rural neighborhood. Definitely powerful
5,Very good bass for the money. Have bought them twice before. I have bought a few more expensive better subwoofers but none that justified the price difference. Works very well in a smallish to medium living room or bedroom. Has more deep bass (under 40 hz) than most stand alone full range speakers under $1000 a pair. plays well with music and movie low bass special effects.
5,I use this PSW10 for vanatoo TzeroDeep bass I placed the PSW10 on the foam and foam on my wall to reduce the distribution in low frequency. I am happy 😊
5,The speaker worked out great and the subwoofer and was easy hook-up has both speaker inputs and line level inputs. Before that into another small speaker system and it added excellent base to the system. Polk Audio products in my opinion have always been good and this product proved it to me again.
5,Very impressed!  This being a 10-inch sub it really carries a punch!  Polk has quality speakers at reasonable prices!  You will not go wrong discovering Polk as your new brand of choice.  They are great!
5,This is a great sub I set it up in a small bedroom bass is clear and fills the room. For the price you couldn't ask for better. I highly recommend this subwoofer for small or large rooms. It impresses me.
1,Worked fine for a little over a year then stopped working. After I called customer service I was told to change the fuse (which it has none) I was then told that I would have to send to repair service center and pay for shipping and insurance coverage in case it was lost or damaged.  Shipping and insurance cost almost as much as a new sub. Wasted several days dealing with people that couldn’t speak good English and finally throwing this peace of junk in a dumpster. Will never buy another Polk product again. So much for 3 yr warranty.
5,Nice Sub!!
5,Ive owned this sub for a few years now its great sounds good i use it for movies games and music it hits i have it in a fairly large room and i can really piss off my apartment complex if i want to. Really enjoyed it. Hooked up to sherwood amp with 2 sony speakers pioneer center channel and 1 insignia speaker. The sub powers 2 speakers. Sounds great
5,I love this sub! Be careful she can get out of control! My first sub what can I say? But it blew me away! had no idea. Low pass up volume down. I have a small living room so I don't need much just dont want to piss the neighbors off! also got the CS10 & love that as well but this sub is awsome! I am saving to by some Polk surround speakers.
5,Well done
5,this speaker sounds great I love that I don't have to turn it off and on due to the auto switch that powers the speaker when the receiver sends sound signals to it. I don't always have my surround system on but when I switch it on the sub is ready. I replaced my 20 year old Yamaha sub when it finally died of old age. The price is right and the bass is outstanding.I was very pleased.
5,Wow you usually get what you pay for but in this case you get a lot More than you paid for. So happily appreciative of the product especially for the price I paid. I highly recommend.
5,Polk`s always been known for great sounding speakers and this is no exception.  I was looking for a 12" sub but this is just right.  My 2 room listening area is about 375 sq. ft.  This is plenty of sound for me.  I add the polk m60`s l/r the cs2 center and monitor 40`s for the rears.  I couldn`t be more pleased.  Hooked up to a Denon AVR-1910.  Did a lot of checking online and these were very reasonable and fit the bill.
5,Actually sounds pretty damn good.  Was expecting mediocre quality for the price but I'm genuinely blown away.  The area they cut costs was the box which can peal like any particle board.
1,Blew a fuse after about 3 weeks use. Replaced fuse and unit now has a constant loud hum. Seems to be a common issue with this model. Before the issue the sound and loudness were decent for the price.
5,I added this Polk Subwoofer to a Vizio Soundbar and it made a huge difference in the sound quality. I didn't have a desirable option for running a Surround Sound setup so opted to give this a try and am really happy I did. I used the Belkin Subwoofer Audio Cable with a Monster Y-Adapter which I also purchased from Amazon.com and the added base is really great. It not only improves movie viewing but I have Pandora Internet Radio on our Tivo service which is also super good!!!
5,I've had circa 90's huge rack systems now in storage. Downsized to this along with some Polk Audio bookshelf speakers. I love this thing especially at it's current price point. Very efficient and as long as you adjust/place accordingly no problems covering the bass spectrum you will need for almost any music. I have had no problems with distortion or unwanted vibration from the cones. Would recommend. Update: purchased another one for the "Man Cave". At $99.00 dollars how can you go wrong?
5,I feel like I really made a great deal on this sub. For what I paid for this sub I was not expecting it to sound as good as others I have that cost me 3 to 4 times as much. This thing fills my large living room with solid lows. Very happy
5,Plenty of low end thump. Better than the Polk 8in sub I was using before. If you're looking to get a great sounding affordable subwoofer. The Polk PSW10 is it. Setup was pretty simple too.
5,Where have you been all my life! Combo this with my soundbar = in home theater.Of course it's not a Yamaha or some stupid expensive brand. But you get a lot of bang/boom for your buck.
4,Good value
5,This was perfect for my 18×18 room. I cannot give a better review. I supplemented this with polk 60 monitor series towers. I'm waiting on the center channel speaker next. But perfect for an apartment. My receiver is a Denon from the mid 90s. Buy it with the 25 foot cable and it will go anywhere.
4,For a small leaving room is perfect. Love this thing. Buy it and u will not regret it.
5,Awesome quality for the price getting another one :)
3,As the header reads great for TV and video. But after much attenuation "muddy" for music playback. No clear "punch" or focused low-end reproduction. Just boomy rumble. And this is from a longtime Polk fan.
4,Good entry-level sub. Works in a great in a house or even in an apartment if you're lucky to have good construction and keep the volume reasonable. It won't bring down the walls but it will put some kick in your movies.
4,Sounds wonderful! I paired them with Bose 3 series IV bookshelf speakers and the combo is beautiful to listen to!
5,first i brought a onkyo tx- nr609 receiver hooked it up and forget that i needed a powered subwooferdid my research and came up on thisthe price ok so i got it overnight.i couldnt wait to open itcame well packed too.i hooked this bad boy up in less than a min..Ps dont forget to buy subwoofer audio cable..away got it playing..wow i was amazedmy body shakingwallsceiling everything shaking.i got it in my home theater sorround soundright now i'm using a 5.1 system.my movies come alive fast action scarywhatever.too words....GET IT.
4,Plugged it into a Yamaha soundbar that has a sub out jack. Helps fill out the sound nicely. Got a smoking deal at 90$.For what I'm using it for it's great.
5,Used this sub with 2 outdoor speakers in my garage. For the price it sounds great and has good volume. Are the better options for a higher price absolutely.
5,I am very happy with the performance of the subwoofer which was clearly missing from my speaker setup.  It was a nice price and arrived in good packaging.  Very happy.
5,Perfect easy integration into any set up with RCA input as well as speaker wire.  Good control.
5,Yes indeed once in a while a product DOES actually deliver considerably and genuinely above and beyond ones expectations.  The Polk Audio PSW10 Subwoofer is such a creation.  My credentials are as a broadcast and sound professional.  I've several subwoofers. I've recently added a Denon AVRS500BT to my HTS.  This subwoofer MAKES the system.  BRAVO Polk Audio!  I am not worthy . . . !  ;)
5,Wow I am surprised at the quality and quantity of sound.  I was thinking I needed to spend hundreds to get this sound nope this is perfect. I would definitely recommend this subwoofer.
5,Couch shaking bass. Love it
5,This thing bangs! Only complaint is that when you turn it up the force of the sub's air pressure can force the speaker cover off! LOL. Good problem to have me thinks.
4,Was looking for a small powered sub for the front room that would be used for both videos and music. This fit the bill perfectly. Provides just enough punch to add realisim to movies without blowing us out of our seats. (I have a 1700 watt media room for that!)Seller had it to me very fast and it was in near perfect condition just as they stated.
5,Plug and play sounds great in my room and a great addition to my home theater.
5,Fantastic woof. I'm glad I read the details and saw it requires it's own power. It's a LOT bigger than I anticipated but we'll manage. I have a ton of different cables laying around but had to get a new one for this.
5,Great sounding sub woofer. I have two of them. Hard to beat the sound and build quality for the money. Simple control layout to cover cross over and bass volume. Also the controls work as expected so you can easily contour the response of the subwoofer. Better than the Onkyo or Yamaha subs I previously had.
4,I recently purchased a pair of tower speakers that had all ranges but felt that it lacked clean bass during music playback. So after doing some research settled on this inexpensive Polk sub. I have to say it really was a great choice for my space and budget. It added just the right amount of clean bass I was looking for.
5,I'm no technically savvy audiophile but I know what sounds good to me and this really sounds great.  Very satsfied and for the cost it's probably impossible to beat.  Fantastic for music and enhanced our movie watching.  We hooked this up to our secondary system older Yamaha surround replacing the original Yamaha subwoofer. It's probably way more than we needed but it made a remarkable difference and upgrade in listening experience.  Everybody is playing movies they havent seen in a while all of a sudden
5,First off I wouldn't recommend this for those who live in an apartment.  You won't get to experience the sound of high-quality bass this subwoofer produces.  In all other cases it's hard to be disappointed by this product.  I combine this sub with the   VIZIO VSB200 Universal HD Sound Bar         and it's all the audio I need for my entertainment setup that uses music movies and video games.  Polk makes high-quality audio products at an affordable price and this subwoofer is testament to that.
5,This subwoofer was purchased as an additional unit for a small 2.1 home theater setup. Used primarily to play bass-heavy music this subwoofer absolutely keeps up with loud environments and coming from a pro sound background is one of the best consumer subwoofers I’ve personally heard.
4,Great addition to my home audio system. I didnt know how much sound I was missing until.I hooked the sub up. It sounds great!
5,For the money this is a great little subwoofer.  I had an expensive Infinity one which crapped out on me and to be honest for the price difference I can't tell a proportionate difference in sound.  Highly recommended.
4,For the money it's nice. If you position it just right and crank 'er up your teeth will rattle.
5,Is perfect square
5,This is a great product for the price I paid. A friend of my husband's (who is a huge tech geek)  showed it to me because he had been wanting a new one but I had no clue what to pick. So I got it for my husband for Christmas  and he loves it. It's just as good or better than more expensive units.
4,The box is stuffed with loose fiber but it offers surprisingly deep base.
5,I needed a new subwoofer since the one that I had (A tiny 4 inch) was dying and poping... This sub is absolutely amazing! One disclaimer is that they put a metal bar in the back of the port for no known reason and it creates port noise on high volumes...  One note - make sure you break it in before you really get it pumping!
5,Sounds great. Fills the entire house. Not sure about tuning frequency but it will unload at really low frequencies. Happens very seldom at abnormally low hz.
5,I'm not a audio expert. I just knew it was time to update portions of my existing system. I matched this subwoofer with a Yamaha receiver and a polk CS center channel speaker. The result is a nicely balanced system. One where the subwoofer isn't banging you in the chest but rather provides the lows that the source material demands. I highly recommend this subwoofer.
5,This thing is so good I bought SIX one after the other. One for my outside deck system one for my Mac computer sound system two for the theater rear speakers and one for the theater center speakers. (I can't remember where the last one is. LOL) I also have a $1000 a/d/s subwoofer system (with two 10" drivers) for the front theater speakers but I think this Polk subwoofer might be better.
5,Not an audiophile here but I really enjoy this sub. I really feel like I got my money's worth.Has a solid amount if power especially considering the price. Decent depth and a good range. I've seen this item in stores for way more than the list price here. Definitely recommend.
5,Actually a bit bigger than I expected but sounds good with my Edifier speakers.
5,Well me start by saying "hot damn" that bass hit me like hallelujah (whoo).All jokes aside it's an amazing indoor sun and I don't have a top notch receiver. My only regret is not having it already.
5,Oh baby does is this thing amazing! I have it under my desk in my dorm and it is fantastic. It doesn't draw too much power from the amp but it has kick to it. We can turn the volume all they way up and rumble the whole building. It also has the option to leave it on or off all the time or to turn itself off when you don't use it.
4,Its working well. It feels like that it doesn't have that much power. Sometimes I hardly notice the bass but worth the price. Thank you.
5,Liked everything about the sound. The box was just a little bit bigger then I expected
5,Beautiful deep base sounds. Loving it!! I would recommend it to anyone. I have a Klipsch 12" sub as well which is better but also pricier. This one for the price it's a great deal.
5,Adds to the enjoyment of action movies!
5,Clear and rich bass. This is a great addition to my covered patio entertainment system.
5,Works great. Perfect for low-budget studio monitoring. Exactly what you want. No DSP whatsoever. 👌🏼
5,What makes it even better is the price! Sounds great price is amazing. Great deal highly recommend.
5,Probably too much for my bedroom set up!! But adding a subwoofer and taking the base off of the other speakers adds rich full sound that you do not get without a subwoofer.
5,I purchased this sub to replace an Infinity sub that failed after 8 good years. At 50w and such a reasonable price I was skeptical this Polk sub would live up to expectations. After a few weeks of listening I am impressed with the sound and appearance. This sub sounds good playing music or movies. Don't let the reasonable price scare you off. This thing sounds as good as subs costing much more.
4,Good
4,Good value. I am no audiphile but it sounds good.
5,Sounds great can't beat the price. I listen to blues and classical so just needed a bit to fill in the bottom end. Folks into heavy thump might be disappointed. If I ever need a kidney stone dissolved I'll turn it all the way up and see what happens.
4,I've never had a sub-woofer before. I bought his one to try out with a set of Insignia speakers and a Sherwood RX-4503 stereo receiver and was blown away by the sound. We use it for our large screen TV and for listening to our favorite iTunes music. it works very well. It was fairly easy to install and set-up.
5,A product that I recommend very good I was very satisfied the price is very good especially for those who want to buy a subwoof and this with doubts on what to buy I am really satisfied congratulations POLK AUDIO you made me very happy.
5,Polk audio always had a good eye for there music i am astonished by the bump that comes from a 100 watt powered sub works great but can be a little mutty sounding at high volume i figured the way to fix it was taking out the metal bracing leading to the air port hole this causing a larger air flow and less backed up sound. Product is great.
4,Awesome replacement for an older smaller unit. Like other reviewers we like the sound and it's perfect for a medium sized room. Setup was a snap and the housing is modern and attractive.
5,Upgraded from a much older subwoofer. The increase in sound quality was amazing. Definitely happy with the value on this.
5,Can't beat for the price. Highly recommended.
5,Definitely the best sub I've used/heard in a while especially for the low cost. I was worried at first since I couldn't listen to it before buying but this sub is really good and is probably 99% as good as my friend's Bose setup that cost him over $1000
5,Didn't realize how much we were missing till we replaced our blown subwoofer with this.  Amazing quality and sound.  Watched the latest Star Wars movie finally and this little baby really made it so much more enjoyable.  Thought about dumping the audio system and getting a soundbar. Now I'm glad we didn't this is an excellent addition.
5,I bought two Polk PSW110 subwoofers and both went bad after about a year.  I replace with the less expensive PSW10 which I think has superior sound and are workhorses.  I now own three.  Highly recommend this product.
5,I am no audiophile but this was the best boom for the buck.  I am very please with how this fits in to my 7.1 set up.
5,Very decent product at a good price.  Would recommend buying for the price.  Slick look bass is surprisingly great for a unit that is around $100.
5,This is a great subwoofer. Fills the whole room with deep clean bass. I would definitely buy this again. And for only $100 this is a deal you just can't pass by
5,Like Gene Simmons said " God  of thunder " shakes the room great  pressure but wish had got the next higher  subwoofer . I like to feel the Boom in my heart. Totally acceptable.  Personable preference in sound.
5,I have had one in my studio for several years and just bought this one for the house.For the money it out plays everything in a higher price range.
5,Sounds way better then I expected way better
5,This subwoofer is pretty awesome! Plenty of bass for my living room that fills the room and sounds amazing. I definitely recommend! There is a slight port noise issue but it's fixable if you remove the grill at the end of the port.
5,Deep bass in a cheap package.  This sub is nice it packs a good punch for it's size and power output.  I have it's big brothers in my living room.  This one is perfect for my computer system.  I have Audioengine A5+ for regular speakers.  They needed some help in the boom department.  This did the trick.  Another great product by Polk!
5,Sounds great. Worth every penny. Wish I would've bought it sooner. Easy to hook up. Great for surround sound
5,Purchased this on sale and couldn't be happier. It's being used in a family room setup with Energy 5.1 Take Classic and an Onkyo HT-RC360. Medium size room and it performs more than adequately for a home theater surround sub which is what I primaritly use the system for. Haven't used it much for music so can't comment on that.No regrets on this purchase and unless you are an audiophile I think the average user looking for a nice budget sub will find it here.
5,Nice clean bass with not too much distortion. I used to have a full stereo but with kids... nothing is sacred. This hides behind the chair and 'out of sight out of mind' keeps the kids from destroying it like they did to the dust cones of my reference speakers.  Now the TV volume is all I have to adjust.
5,I posted a three star before but it was because amazon and UPS wrecked my order. I will however post a 5 for I have this box from another retailer and it sounds amazing. I also have the 12 psw 121 by polk on the same system and they just sound amazing. So in closing this PSW 10 is great but if you want the full range go for the 12 as well.
5,an avid classical music collector and listener will be delighted with the value and quality exhibited in the Polk PSW10.the basso continuo line in chamber music is quite unpretentious and subtle (depending on the adjustment set).one could not be happier with a sub-woofer which knows how to behave politely in the company of the baroque masters.stillin the midst of a Bach organ prelude and fugue the neighbours may be less than amused....lol! a versatile addition to any mid-range stereo system regardless of one's taste.quite literallya steal.
4,For its price point this product works remarkably well. I would say that it has adequate power perhaps even more than its rating. Its only down side would be the instructions that accompany the product. Being a professional audio tech I didn't need them but for the average consumer they were woefully inadequate. Overall for $89.00 you can't beat it.
5,This was a perfect compliment for Polk Monitor 4 bookshelf system adds lots of depth in my small listening space easy pass through wiring for old Technics receiver from 70’s that doesn’t have sub-out.  Highly recommend.
4,I love this speaker more for the price point the bass is good after you adjust it but can get muddy if you don't have it calibrated well in your receiver. I will at some point sell this one and upgrade to the Klipsch 12 subwoofer. heard that beast in Best Buy and wow it handles bass in spades!!!
5,A+
5,Undoubtedly one of the best sounding subwoofers that you can get if you’re on a tight budget. The bass is super clean but can also pack a punch at higher volume.
5,Great Name Brand Speaker at a great price!Adds the fullness of sound to whatever I’m viewing or listening to on my surround sound. Easy installation.
5,Another satisfied customer! Sounds better than my previous sub that was twice the price !!! quality seems to be top notch !! Have it in basement living room 25' x 30' sounds explosive!  Have it in basement living room 25' x 30' sounds explosive! Sounds absolutely great for movies video games music TV sports put a little extra boom in your life and you'll feel a lot better!!
5,Great sound for the price didn't take long for my neighbors to complain
4,No documentation for all the switches. Only addresses connections not usage.
5,if you are reading this you are planning to get this Sub trust me i did and couldn’t be happier!! its small but POWERFUL!!! get it you wont regret it
5,Excellent for the budget. With the volume all the way up you will find that this woofer will be too much for most small rooms.  The assumption is that if you are looking for a woofer in this budget range you are using it in a system that is not top notch.  I have several manufacturers and have a 5.1 setup and this woofer worked perfectly for my room which measures 15'x24'
5,Great bass output for the cost.  I am replacing a Boston Acoustic unit that came with my home theater system and this unit seems to put out crisp clear sound.  I actually have to keep it turned down as the rest of my system isn't as nice and not balanced against the higher output of this sub.  I recommend it!
4,My grill was all faded too much work to send it back.
5,Bought it $99.  Paired it with Polk TL150s bought at BB for $120open box and a open box Pioneer VSX-822-K.  Sounds great and fills my 18X25ft room with 16ft vaulted ceiling with sound for movies and music.  I would recommend this sub to anyone.  Took some time to tweak everything now it sounds perfect.  All for under $500.  I do adjust crossover and volume for movies and different types of music but I don't mind getting up and doing it.
5,Waaay better than I expected for what I use it for watching television.
5,I needed another subwoofer for my basement setup and decided to go with another Polk sub.  This one does the job in a great way and couldn't be any happier.  My neighbors on the other hand may kill me!  LOL....  Tested it out last night playing Call of Duty MW3 and watched Die Hard the movie and felt my stomach rumbling!  Lovely!  For $99 bucks you can't beat the price.  The same subwoofer is $199 at Best Buy.
5,This sub is has clean bass and matches well with my presonus eris8 and eris5 speakers.
5,This thing works. I have it setup with my Onkyo TX 8020 2ch stereo and Q Acoustics 3020 bookshelf speakers. The sound is great and fills my listening area (15x15)
5,Really makes a difference on sound well liked
5,For the money this thing cracks it out. I have a Yamaha CR 600 with some 90s ceremonies Vega towers and a technic turntable that really puts out amazing sound now. Great addition to home theatre or music set up.
5,Great little sub!  Don't forget to set your speakers to small (small = bass management on has nothing to do with size) and start with a crossover of 80.  I am using with tower speakers and it blends in very well.  Use phase adjustment to time align sub with mains.
5,I bought this speaker in conjunction with a Polk Audio CS10 center speaker so I now have true 5.1 surround sound.  The subwoofer seems to work quite well and I'm hearing bass sounds in both music and tv audio that I'd not heard previously.  I'd buy this speaker again.
5,This speaker is used with a Stereo amp and Polk Audio shelf speakers to player vinyl records and cassette tapes only. So it need to have a volume control built in because it is not connected to surround sound amp which usually has built in volume controls for all channels. The extra bottom end sound it adds is so pleasing when listening to my classical record collection. The volume control allows tailoring the sound to perfection.
4,My only compliant is this unit does have an LFE input. I recommend purchasing a splitter so you can tap into birth left and right signals. Using only one or the other doesn't effect sound quality but by using the splitter the sub does not need to be turned up as high to achieve the same volume.
4,Great sub. I bought a pair of TSi200 bookshelf speakers to go with this and the whole system is amazing. One wish is that the sub went a little lower though. As far as loudness and settings this is a great product.
5,This has gotta be the best sounding Powered Subwoofer I have heard it reminds me of how my old Klipsch sub soundedPROS:1)great sound really fills the room2)can't beat the price (compared to other subwoofers on the market)3)completes the home theater system sound4)great for musicCONS)1)none That I can think ofOverall this is a great deal if you want a subwoofer that is great sounding and at a small price then this is for you
5,I bought this for my office speakers but it ended up being so good i used it at home for my living room. Really good Bass for a budget sub woofer.
4,Used in living room surround sound system.  Good strong bass sound.  Looks good too.
5,Sounds great
4,This unit works well but it's way bigger than I expected.
5,I bought this subwoofer to compliment to my new entertainment center and have been using it now for about a month.  WOW...what an improvement it has made to the sound. This subwoofer has opened a whole new dimension for watching movies and listening to music. The PSW10 provides very clean smooth low-end bass with a good punch. The price and quality are excellent and I would recommend this subwoofer to anyone.
5,Great for med to large rooms may burst your eardrums in too small of a space lol. Super easy setup plug an play on any amp or theatre system
5,I have one in the living room that I had first loved it. So I bought the second for the system in the garage. The sound is awesome!! Tight clean little sub. Very impressive for the size and the money. A friend of mine liked it so much he also bought one.  I would highly recommend to anyone.
5,Powerful impressive bass.RECOMMENDATION: You will need a Y-type signal cable to appreciate all the bass.Funny that the manual said you could terminate a single channel cable from the receiver amp to either Left or Right on this unit as well.From what research I have done about this terminating to both the Left and the Right on the unit is most likely better.
5,Far from the best on the market for over all quality compared to what's available in the world of today but for what I need it for it's a great sub I like it
5,Excellent sound currently hooked up to Yahama RX A2040 receiver and Polk speakers. No issues we love it.
5,This is a really good subwoofer for the money.  I listen to music on my PC and wow does this deliver.  Some distortion at louder volumes but excellent performance for the price.  Needs powered (post amp) input so you can run a DVD player directly into it.
4,I bought this sub about a year ago and use it mostly for home theater use.  It works great for about 90% of the movies that I watch.  But during some really low sounds in some movies you can year it distort and vibrate.  This is the only reason that I could rate it 4 instead of 5 stars.  I watch all kinds of movies but action is probably what I watch most.
5,Awsome speaker! I bought 2. Kinda wish I'd bought a 12 now though. Great quality and sound!
4,Solid amp
5,Very comparable to my other subwoofer and now my home theater setup is complete!
5,I like it. Using it with an Onkyo 8270 and Elac B6 speakers in a 15x15 cathedraled ceiling room. Easily dialed in for the room. It is bigger than I imagined but I have it placed behind a couch angled in a corner. Worth every penny.
5,Sounds great.  Very easy to hook up.  Puts out a lot of sound.  Was thinking about buying 2 until I got it and hooked it up.  Don't think I need another one.  Not only can you hear the bass but you can feel it!  Very nice and well built.
5,This speaker worked perfect till just after the warrenty expired then the amp fried  wish you would send a new amp
5,Needed to replace our sub woofer because it went bad. It Came In Earlier than expected.
4,I wasn't sure what to expect for $100 but it is actually very good. Week built fills in low tones makes movies sound great. However if you are going to crank your music loud it cannot keep up. It distortes well before the rest of the speakers and so you have to turn it down.
2,This Polk sub is just okay. I compared with performance of three other small subs (Sony Klipsch and Yamaha) and it didn't impress. It gets good customer reviews but it's bass extension was not that great compared with the other subs. And this sub is large so you'd think it would perform better. I returned it.
5,Amazing! I'm buying another one! It is MASSIVE for $130 and it sounds AMAZING!!! Plus the outside has a very nice finish! Some tips for this is to get an rca cable with 1 females and 2 male( red and white) for the subwoofer and if you want to hook up to a set of speakers without a receiver or amp then get another cable with 2 females and a male. Hope this helps!
4,Good speaker for the price. Limited connectivity on this model.
5,Pretty much the gold standard for entry level custom home theater. The bass quality is a pretty big step up from the basic "all in one" home theater sets. Pair this with a decent receiver and you won't be disappointed.
5,So far this subwoofer has met and exceeded all of my expectations. It sounds great and has way more bass than I need. I heard these have bad port noise but I don’t hear it.
5,I absolutely love this sub. I wasn't after anything that would pound your chest or blow your ears out just wanted a nice base line for music and to provide that rumble in action movies. This certainly gets the job done and I didn't have to spend all that much money.
5,Perfect addition to my system. Sound quality is fantastic!
5,The best bang for the buck. Designed more for music than movies but it does okay. It supports lots of configurations and the fact that it has a standby power position makes it great. I have two of these paired with a Sony receiver and a Pioneer receiver and they sound phenomenal. Can't really go above a certain volume or they will distort but they put out a lot of pressure enough to rattle your couch or floor.
1,So disappointing. It took 2 weeks to arrive. I understand that it's a pandemic and nonessential orders can take longer but it helped build up the anticipation especially in view of the excellent overall ratings and reviews for this product.Alas. When it arrived and everything was hooked up here was nothing but a loud hum as soon as the Y-shaped RCA cable was connected to this subwoofer. (I have Klipsch R-15PM speakers which have a dedicated Sub-Out jack).  I believe the capacitor(s) in this sub must have gone bad. It is not a ground loop problem because the speakers and this sub are connected to the same power supply same power outlet.Is this a used and returned product or is it bad QA on the manufacturer's part?  Anyway I have to return this and it is very heavy.
4,Good
5,Adds great depth to my sound system.It's got some thump alright.
1,First of all I didn't expect a high end quality sub woofer. I bought this just to test my Harmon Kardan receiver and see if my HK sub output was bad or my KLH sub woofer was bad. I discovered my KLH sub was bad and the PA sub worked fine. However the quality of sound and power was very poor even for 50 watts. The low frequency did not respond as low as my KLH and most of the time I didn't know if it was even on just like others have said below. I don't expect rumble like a 200 watt but at least it should have some feel to it. My KLH cost $100 also and is far superior in frequency response and power. The PA sub is just not an efficient speaker. I have a high powered HK receiver so I have ample power needless to say to power any sub. I do not think this sub is sufficient for even small rooms. Because of the inefficient speaker the 50 watt can't drive it adequately. I expected better response even for $100. My surround speakers are PA also and they are superb in sound response and quality. I will use this sub for my small t.v. in family room and buy a real sub now that I know my amp does work. To conclude there are other subs out there that are just as cheap or few dollars more that bring in far superior frequency response and power.
4,how can you complain about a $100 sub woofer. sounds great for music of all types not the best for home entertainment as the really low lows in movies gets a little muddy but for music it works just fine and now my wife can turn it up and not blow out the woofers on her high end speakers
5,The compact PSW10 pimps out some very tight and low bass notes w/o over powering the other speakers.
4,I chose this because of the vast amount of reviews that were on the whole quite favorable.  I'm happy with the looks the sound and the price I felt was reasonable.
5,Awesome power .. I love it .. I would buy again .. Worth the money for sure.Ive been using this for at least a month now .. Still glad i bought it .. Very pleased 💀
2,I have a 12” PSW505 that I have had for the past year that I really enjoyed and thought it did a killer job for the price. I decided to buy this Polk 10” sub for another room looking for something more punchy and less boomy. Out of the box the subwoofer was in amazing condition no scratches or dents. I plugged it into my system and sounded quite distorted anywhere past half. I decided to play music over the next weeks on low volume to try and excercise the suspension but it did not help. I returned the sub and might just buy another 12” due to my good experience with the first.
5,It was a good price and I like the extra sounds I get from my speakers from it it carries out a loud tones movie sounds so much better no more crackling
5,Before I read some reviews about the dept of drive the 10" Sub gives and I can tell you its more the a 12" Sub I am familiar with. really sounds good in my 30' x 15' man cave.
5,I have the Polk 12" powered subwoofer for my living room and wanted something to enhance my home office sound experience. This 10" Polk does the job though it is powerful enough to fill a much larger room than my office. You can't beat this subwoofer for the money.
5,Sounds great in our media room. Add a lot of dimension to movies and music. I was a bit concerned at first that there were two audio plugs while previous subwoofers I've owned had only one and my Receiver only has one.  After a little research I found out you only need to use one of the two or you can purchase a simple two into one plug (which I did).
5,Great for my garage tv stereo! Anything more will turn those nice neighbors not so nice.. Thanks for the bump Amazon!
4,The biggest issue I have ever had with any speaker is that the cone is made of paper and can easily aquire damage. This sub functions extremely we'll between 45Hz and 500Hz I replaced this sub with two Boss Audio P12DVC subwoofers and the amp from this sub sufficiently drives them at 8 Ohms parallel.
5,This subwoofer exceeded my expectations! The bass is clear and clean and puts out more than enough sound to satisfy my 70s taste in music. I find myself pouring through my vinyl collection again like I haven't in decades just to hear what they sound like with this new speaker.  My only regret is that I didn't have this years ago!
5,This thing is amazing. I bought a pioneer SW-8MK2 wasn't too thrilled and it was more expensive than this. So I thought I I'd give this little guy a shot. It is better than the pioneer both in quality and quantity and it's less expensive. If you are wondering which sub between theses 2 definitely go with the Polk
5,Awesome beautiful rich bass that is not too punchy (unless you want it) 5 year warranty from mfg. My Dad was so impressedhe bought one and replaced his old. I want another for left and right. Woo Hoo.
5,Bigger than I thought and works great.  You have to read the manual to find optimal settings but when you get it the subwoofer works great.  Only critique is the manual should have clear sections from english french and others as it is now the manual is all jumbled together.  That was annoying :(
4,Love it right bang for the buck 80s rock three subs kicking butt with AppleTV it was just a little bigger than I expected but that's OK
4,After purchasing the subwoofer I decided to put a 10 inch skar sdr subwoofer in it.this thing slams with a better sub installedamplifier on the box has plenty of power to make a 1200 watt 10 inch pound.for the $80+ upgrade it is well worth the price for the box and amplifier installed in it.also im running it at 4 ohms no issues whatsoever
5,I was looking for an inexpensive subwoofer to fill up the low end on my home entertainment system. This thing did it!!! I didnt have to turn it up that high to get great bottom end. I love watching movies at the house again because this thing rocks!!!
5,What a great value!  We've enjoyed this for nearly a year and have NO complaints. Compact design powerful output (I like to feel my movies) quality construction.  Not a rattle no distortion pure bass output feel and sound.  Two ways to control output on board so it fits your system and surroundings perfectly.  Quality piece from a top manufacturer.
5,works great
5,Decided to try to stay on a budget and go with this subwoofer until I could upgrade......then I got this sub and had to turn it down because it filled my large open floorplan living room just fine. I run it around 50% power and it's plenty for me. Was really surprised by its performance and for around a hundred bucks it's a steal.
2,Sound quality was bad due to loud hum/buzz
5,Amazing subwoofer for the money.  Best deal out there.  Very pleased with mine.  Have it hitched up to a small Grace Amp which is also powering 2 8" Bose in-ceiling speakers.  System sounds fantastic.
5,Easy to set up has great analog adjustments on the back to account for poor receiver adjust-ability like i have. Can easily switch it off when you don't need a heavy bass evening.
5,I bought this sub when building a 5.1 system in my bedroom and I am not disappointed.  If you tune it properly to match your system and you're not in a giant room you will not be disappointed.  If you just turn the volume to max and expect it to sound good it won't.  The only thing missing from this system is an LFE input but for <$100 no complaints.  Just split a sub cable with a Y adapter and you're set.
5,Amazing home theater sub esp at this price point
5,Great value! This sub really rounded out my systems sound. Used in conjunction with 2 JBL floor speakers that I have had forever. Very impressed for right at $100 I don't think this sub can be beat!
5,I bought this subwoofer to go along with my Boston bookshelf speakers and my Polk Audio center channel speaker. I have it hooked up to my Pioneer receiver and I have to say it is an amazing subwoofer!!! I use it everyday listening to Hiphop/rap playing video games and watching movies. It's perfect! I cant believe its only 100 bucks!!!!! It's  a steal! BUY IT IF YOU NEED AN AMAZING SUBWOOFER AND HAVE 100 BUCKS LYING AROUND! Very happy with it.
5,NO DISLIKES  THIS SUB WORKS GREAT AT LOW OR HIGH VOLUMES. EXCELLENT PRODUCT !  A++++
4,Does the job.  I've connected it to a Yamaha receiver (analog) that does 5.1 surround sound and has subwoofer output (analog).  Unit has a very low crossover point -- but that's what I wanted.  The other speakers have to carry the audible sound and directionality.
5,Love this thing. I have it in my basement it shakes my 3 floor!!!
4,worth the money
5,I purchased this sub along with Polk R50 speakers and an Onkyo TX SR505 receiver. The bass from this is GREAT!!I set it up yesterday and me and my girlfriend were watching Pirates of Caribbean and it sounded greatthere was an explosion and it felt like we were right there feeling the concussion we both looked at each other and smiled and said did you feel that?I would highly recommend this product. Sure you could spend more money on a sub but why bother when this sub packs quite a punch.
1,This subwoofer is Highly overrated! Right out of the box there is a loud rattle coming from the port. I looked this up on YouTube and I see instructions on how to fix it but even though it seemed to help it didn’t get rid of the issue! No Subwoofer should do this!!! I have a hundred dollar 8” Pioneer sub from Best Buy that I bought some 10 years ago and it doesn’t rattle! Don’t waste your money! Spend a little more money to find a sub that you won’t have to try to fix right when you open it!
5,I have owned one of these for some years now (originally purchased in 2011) and it has never disappointed!  Currently using it in my bedroom surround setup (with Jamo 25's) and the sound is incredible!  For the price this sub cannot be beat.  I have recommended this to a number of friends and family.
5,Such a fantastic sound for such a low price. I love it though it is larger than I expected. No worries it fits into my whole entertainment set up really well.
4,This was a great deal for me since I got it new for under a hundred bucks. At 30 dollars more would look at something a little more powerful. But for my smallish living room it is perfect.
5,Works perfect right out of the box. Super easy setup and awesome sound!
5,a must have!! lot cheeper and same sound as the storesim running 2 of them one from a sound storeand one got here on Amazonsame sound quality from both
4,It is very nice in the price point around $100. The bass and Treble on music got improved after having this
5,They sound Awesome for a small room they handled great make movies and music give you the power you need to still bother you're neighbors and enjoy the mancave...
5,I wanted a little more impact out of movies in my home theatre and saw the Polk PSW10 on your site.  I currently have a Energy ESW8 powered subwoofer but this product lacks the low end impact that I was looking for and that is why I purchased the Polk.  From the moment I connected the subwooferI have been very pleased with it's features and performance.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their sound in their system.
5,I am very satisfied with this product. Both sound quality and material. Only wished it is equipped with 100V- 240V power adapter for some of us outside USA.
4,with good sounds and looks i am happy with my purchase
5,This is nice addition Subwoofer to my BOSE Acousmatic-16 system.  I run a Y-split (1M/2F)  from my Denon Pre-out to each of the sub (both PSW10 and the Bose Subwoofer).  Set the PSW10 low-pass full clockwise to 160HZ max. and set my Denon Receiver Subwoofer Crossover anywhere between 80-100HZ depends on taste.  Listening to music and watching movies more enjoyable than ever.  Excellent price for additional sub really should cost a lot more for pretty decent quality.
5,this is awesome ..it fits in with my setup and complements the other speakers in quality and presence. For the price this is a great deal....
5,This product rounds out my system nicely Currently using these in conjunction with (4) DB651s 45 watts at 4 ohms a  PIONEER GM-A5602 900-Watt 2-Channel Amp  4 ohms: 150 watts x 2 chan and Kenwood DDX471HD DVD receiver. wonderful sound..Everything listed here was purchased on amazon.PS Im running two channels through a switcher to control the rooms getting the sound as it's installed on a 5th wheel trailer..
5,Sound Quality is excellentReasonably Priced
5,I love this! I had bought a soundbar but did t realize that it was only 40 watts. Once I added this my room booms now!
3,If you are looking for a movie sub only would highly recommend .I would have given this review 5 stars for movies.For music not bad but not good .just ok! listening to music the sub lacks punch at mid volume.low volume excellenthigh volume distortion no matter how i adjust it  if I adjust bass low not enough bassif I turn the bass up starts to distort and rumble. However for the price you cant beat it!!and also my ears are very picky you may love it!! If you want a sub better than this you got a pay twice the price.if your just watching movies BUY IT!!!!!!
5,Good sound huge base setup in a 5.1 setup with a Yamaha AVENTAGE receiver.
5,Solid subwoofer especially for its price.
5,Great price and really adds bottom end to bookshelf speakers. Would buy again.
1,Initial 3 years of operation were good. HOWEVER now into the 4th year of use and the amplifier portion of this sub failed totally. Customer support would have me ship it to them ($$$$) and then tell me how much to repair it Not under warranty because the amp is covered for only THREE years. After examining the amp I realized why this subwoofer was a good price to begin with. It is a piece of cheap junk. Personally I will now avoid with a passion all Polk Audio products.
5,Nice for the price thinking on getting another for an atmos 5.2.2 setup
5,Love this sub from Polk Audio. It’s got nice low bass.
5,replaced my $300. Sony 12"
5,I replaced my old sub with this one ....WOW ...amazing deep bass made my sound system sound like it should...fantastic productlow price ....POLK ROCKS!!!!
5,I was drawn to this product from a friend that purchased this speaker about 8 years ago.  I ordered quick delivery and replacing an older sub I was using.  This amazing speaker sounds amazing.  Perfect bass tones.  During movies it actualy rattles most of my house.  Awesome for such a cheap price tag. Perfect for what I need.
5,The bass line on Jericho by The Band is tight.A piano on Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 sounds like a piano.I can hear the double basses full like they sound in Symphony Hall in Boston not like Avery Fisher Hall in New York.I paid $10 more than Amazon is now offering but I am a happy boy having spent $100 to feel the music in my bones. Buy the y-connector. It gives you more control.Ciao.
4,This subwoofer sounds awesome it's super easy to set up. Even easier to listen to. ;3(Obviously.)It does leave you with a little something to be desired in terms of the actual thump from this woofer.Even with the bass turned all the way up it still doesn't hit quite as hard as some of the other subs in the price range.
5,I purchased a new reciever for my father not noticing it only accepted a 'powered' subwoofer.  So I went on the hunt for a quality one.  It's large so read the dimensions.  But I couldn't have asked for a better product/price.  It's very scalable too.  Don't be afraid to purchase it for a lower-end home theater system.  Later in life you'll be able to pair this with any high-end system.
5,Love this unit made a huge difference to my music listening pleaser.
5,Can't beat it for $100. Rumbles and give great bass feed back.
5,great deal
5,This speaker replaced a 12" PSB sub-woofer that went dead (as they reportedly do with regularity).  This smaller speaker has at least the same if not greater house-filling bass that the 2" larger and more expensive one did at less than 1/5th the price.  Bass is impressive and smooth.  Follow setting directions as the manufacturer recommends and enjoy!  You need nothing more.
5,I take pride in my music and most of my products are Klipsch I wanted to buy their sub woofer but it was about 3 times the price of this one. I took the chance on buying this based on the research I did it was all good reviews. I am so happy I did I get lots of compliments on how well it sounds and I saved myself a lot of money! The product came fast and in excellent condition!
5,Polk has been around awhile so I was expecting a top-notch quality product. I wasn't disappointed. It has many connection options so is very versatile for a wide range of applications. It has volume & frequency (low pass) knobs on the back as well as a phase switch and on/off/stand-by. Sound quality is superb. Caution: This subwoofer is capable of moving objects around the house and will rattle (and possibly break) your windows. I've come close a couple times already :)
5,Fantastic Sub for the price. I have it connected to my Samsung HT-5300 as the woofer that came with it was just not cutting it.  This thing Thumps!
5,I purchased my first set of Polk Audio speakers in 1980.  I still use those speakers on a daily basis and they still sound as good as when I purchased them.  I now have 5 sets of Polk's.  This is the first Polk subwoofer that I have owned and I am impressed.  For the sake of clarity place the subwoofer in an area that doesn't have stuff that rattles for it will surely make the stuff rattle.
5,Nice for the price
5,This is a great sub for people who want to add bass but don't want to add too much bulk to their home theater setup. I already had a small 8" sub and used this to augment that sub and create a more full bad experience.  Would definitely recommend this.  Also when setting up  it's best to have someone there to help so you can tune the volume and phase while you sit in your listening experience.
5,I purchased this Polk subwoofer with great expectations and I was not let down. I was a bit disappointed when I realized that the box was black and not wood colored but OK it fit's in anyway. It provides a superb bass sound to any movie I watch on my LCD projector. Combined with my four other inexpensive wall mounted speakers the Polk unit turns my living room into a movie theater feel on the sound. Just fantastic. Love it!
5,This speaker rocks my man cave studio!!! Outstanding sounds and what a great buy !!
5,Good thumpy sub. "Musical" sounding and not too distorted. Gets the job done at an affordable price.
5,For the price Polk sound is nice. You won't do better.
5,I bought two of these to replace 1 unpowered optimus 12" down firing subwoofer that I had for 16 years. My thought process was  that getting two would make up for larger more "boomy" 12 inch. I only needed one. The sound they produced was stunning in comparison to my older and unpowered speaker.  They produced tighter richer bass then I had ever heard in a house system. I am very happy with my purchase's.
5,When I replaced my HTIB with a new Onkyo AVR I discovered I needed a powered sub. The price was right and the sound quality is more than acceptable for me. I'm sure some audiophiles would be disappointed but for the average casual user like myself this sub fits the budget sound quality and size issues I had. I will be replacing the rest of the speakers in my home theater with Polk units as well. Good value for the money in my book.
2,It looked nice. Had many great reviews. Polk is a very decent brand name and the price was right so I bought 2 of them. When 1st hooked up one had a noticable rattle and buzz. Over the course of the night it became more and more intrusive and rattled loudly at even the lowest volume...The 2nd one sounded great for one night then the slight rattle started to creep in and of course it just got louder and louder. It was useless by the 2nd day. Well that's my experience with this product. I find it hard to give even 2 stars to something that did not even work. However it does look very classie and it seems that most reviewers did not share my experience. I wish I hadn't shared my experience! While checking out some Bic America subs I found more reviews of people returning their Polk Audio subs with the exact same problems I encountered. They seemed to be very happy with the Bic America subs. I went ahead and bought the "CER-WIN VEGA! VE-28S" and I am very happy with it. Thanks for reading my review. I hope it was helpful and I hope you enjoy your new subwoofer!Happy listeningTom
5,Bought this sub for my Pioneer receiver with surround sound! This may be the best value I've ever purchased on Amazon! The sound is great and makes all the difference in my home entertainment system. I bought it for $80 and that sure beat Best Buys price of $199.  Again it really sounds wonderful and I'm quite pleased with this purchase. I could have spent a lot more money on another sub but why? Another great value on Amazon!
1,After a few weeks of operating the sub has taken on a very nasty port sound that makes watching movies pretty bad. This was just for a family room but it will be finding it's way out the door pretty fast. This is the second time Polk has disappointed me and it will be the last. The amp plate gets VERY hot when used at half gain or more. The port noise it has developed after breaking in has ruined the sound in almost all movies I watch. Explosions and deep tone music are now "flat" at medium volume and the port noise destroys the sound output at lower volume. The box itself is very cheap and lacks quality. I have seen no name brands with better quality boxes. If your interested in a low cost sub then look for a no name sub or save for a more expensive unit made by a higher quality manufacturer.I can not recommend this subwoofer to anyone at any cost for any reason.
5,Glad I ordered it. Had a JBL that had a short circuit and stayed on and vibrated. Sound is great and looks elegant and a very good price.
5,Nice clear bass with no rattle or buzz. Solidly built it'll probably last a lifetime. Plus it made my next-door neighbor pound on my door one day...
5,I use this with a USED Onkyo R-805X and it sounds great !  I just purchased this same set-up for my daughter.Make sure not to turn the settings too high.
5,Best sub for the money.  Very clean sound.  I've owned a lot of subs and I always come back to Polk when I can.  As with all subs you've got to get them adjusted right.  A lot of owners complain about excessive vibrations and distortions from their subs but it's almost always the room and/or the setup... not the sub.
5,I have a 15' x 20 great room for my HT and this works perfectly. I have been in the music and sound production industry for the last 25 years and all I can say is wow. I thought this sub may be underpowered but I took a chance anyway. After watching Transformers and Wreck it Ralph I was pleased with how it hit and didn't have any over ring to the sound. Not bad for a sub $100.00 subwoofer.
5,It's a lot bigger than I anticipated. Overall great sound and build quality.
4,Great sub though especially for the cost. Shook the house with Blade Runner 2049's soundtrack especially.
5,Looks great.  The wood cabinet matches the rest of my speakers perfectly.  It does rattle a little with the cover on the front so I took that of.  Sound is great and hook up using the speaker inputs is easy.  Much better than the woofer that came with my surround sound which died on me.  I especially like the built in crossover which keeps the lows from going to my front surround speakers and distorting them.
5,This sub is amazing. When I tell people I got a new 100 watt sub they seem to think that that's not much but don't be fooled this thing kicks.  It handles all kinds of music rap rock metal pop with ease.  If you turn it all the way up the bass feels like something in you is going to pop.  I can't imagine wanting anymore bass for anything.
3,This subwoofer was okay but I could barely hear it even though I don't play my movies or music loud at all. The bass was nice but It had to be turned up to full volume to be heard. After a few hours of use however it just quit and I returned it with no problems. I bought instead a Klipsch 300 watt sub at a higher price and am very impressed and happy with it at half volume.
5,This thing is a steal for what it delivers!  Big bass sound for my system.  I play COD and this thing makes you feel like you are actually shooting a weapon with the percussion it provides.
4,Good sound for the price.. I have a small duplex and the sub produces plenty if not too much sound for this place. The sound quality is good but not amazing. It won't compare to a product 10x the price but I would purchase again.
5,Sounds great. Definitely recommend.
4,Works with new receiver. The automatic on off works fine. Use split RCA input to make auto on/off work better.
5,I have only had this sub for a very short time. I think it does a great job with music and on movies. I use it about half the time for music and half the time for movies. It delivers a good tight bass. I haven't really cranked it up because it sounds good at a normal volume. For the price of 79.99 it was a steal. Overall it was a great addition for my Onkyo 5.1 surround sound system.
4,Good although a single LFE input is not there.  At this price point its more than fair value for the money.
3,This sub woofer replaced one from another manufacturer that I used for 10 years that suddenly just gave up the ghost.  Considering the cost of this new sub woofer I'd have to say it works quite well but if you are looking for a serious/audiophile sub look elsewhere.  This one works well in low to mid-fi situationsi.e. most home theater systems but tends to be a bit boomey and too directionally focused.  Even when I aim it in different directions you can tell where it's located and in which direction it's aimed.  It does however fill the low end (as it should) and can play fairly loud without breaking up too badly.
5,I LOVE this sub. I have nothing bad to say about it at all. It has very nice design and the lows are so heavy. Very happy with this product nothing bad to say about it at all.
5,Bought for my daughter and works like a charm. If there was one thing I ever bought on Amazon that I wished didn't work it would be this item. Buy double sided tape for anything you have on the walls if you have a 17 year daughter.
5,Excellent bass not boomy.  Great buy for the price. I own two one is for our summer home.  The perfect supplement for our near super high end system with high quality bookshelf speakers
5,I have always like Polk Audio speakers and subwoofers but this one stands out among the rest. It is better than many Bose subwoofers and the best part is it's universal! (HATE Bose because everything has to be Bose and FOR that specific system). We have installed MANY of these subwoofers and out customers (along with my at my personal Home Theater) could not be happier! Especially for the price!!! GO POLK!!! Keep the AMAZING Subs coming!
5,This subwoofer is a replacement for an old Polk Audio subwoofer. I wasn't sure what to expect with this sub but it sound amazing and really adds to the surround sound movie experience. The only downside to the subwoofer is I haven't been able to get ride of the rattle that occurs during very high powered subwoofer scenes. Overall I would recommend this sub and purchase it again...especially for the price!
5,I would buy again without hesitation. This bad boy can pump more than enough base to rock your whole house and neighbors. This was my first Polk Audio product that made me a fan.
4,Great addition to my home theater unit.
5,Got this to use with the Klipsch R-15PM powered bookshelf speakers.  For the money this sub really does deliver.  Not going to break windows but what it does is fill the bottom end void with glorious low tones.  Could not be happier with my purchase.
4,Good sound from this sub. To achieve the best sound from this sub you must leave volume on sub just below the half mark. Good price and great product from Amazon. Not a five star due to front cover rattle on sub.
4,Added this to my Bose TV speakers for more base.  Very nice.
5,I purchased this after I previously purchased a Sony SA-W2500 sub.  Not sure if it was Sony's fault as the one I received was used and blown.  My system is primarily Sony and wanted to keep it that way however this sub sounds so great that I may purchase another to have an even better movie theater experience in the home.
2,It didn't work at all. I needed to send it to a repair shop. It cost me as much as the total amount of the purchase because they have to change the internal modules. As I am outside the USA send the broken one was not an option. I got a partial refund but still cost me a lot to have it fixed. It was annoying.When I got it from the repair shop it was working apparently okay but the sound quality was not as good as I hoped. It sounds muddy and have a bothering noise in the background. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,This subwoofer exceeded all of my expectations. Couldn't ask for more.
5,I've had this subwoofer for over a year now and I haven't been disappointed at all. It does excellent with my tv surround sound system. It really makes the movies come alive.  I purchased this one and also the 12" Polk subwoofer for another room in my house. The 10" seems to do better with movies than the 12". I think it has more to do with the frequency range with my surround systems.
5,Love everything about this sub  make sure you buy the right cable !!!!!
5,Great product for the price definitely will be wanting one more
5,Great subwoofer! Easy to hook up. Now my simple system with basic Sony amp. Yamaha 3 way speakers and CD player sounds great. I was so pleased to find a simple line in/line out subwoofer that didn't require anything but speaker wires to set up. A very much needed blast from the past. Who needs the current audio "future shock'?
5,This subwoofer is exactly what I’ve been looking for. Super deep bass and makes the movie experience more rich and immersive. Highly recommend.
5,Good power and clean sound. Great sub for the price.
5,This thing is just awesome.  I paid like $100 for it here and its got a great sound.  I mean its not like you just stuck a pair of Klipschorns in you corners but you didn't spend 3 grand on it either.  Works really good on a budget setup and doesn't skimp on sound quality.
4,Second time buying one of these. Works great low price nice sound.
5,Unbelievable value! This thing really rocks! I have 4 powered subs in my den and this one was to replace one of my small ones. The performance of it is closer to one of my bigger ones!
5,I have to admit at first I was a little hesitant about buying this sub for my home studio. But I am totally satisfied! Nice clean bass. This thing shakes the room! Great product and price!
5,The sound is great for the price! I had to put it in a different spot then I was planning to because this thing is HUGE. Completely my fault for not reading the dimensions. However it don't got a sub-woofer connection but that's fine with me.
5,there should be a volume control in front of the unit
4,Turned out to be last years model and the connections were not what I had expected but it works well.
5,Replaced an Onkyo subwoofer for an onkyo system. Installation was a breeze and new sub-woofer sounds great
5,A lot of boom for a little money.  Hits much harder and cleaner than most budget powered 10s.The enclosure is thick and well-made.  In addition to very decent sound it's quite handsome.Polk does excellent-valued equipment and this is no exception.
4,Nothing to dislike. Price was great. Sounds fantastic.
5,I bought this as a gift and he loved it! It arrived really quickly. I don't why but I didn't expect the box to be so big! Lol I gave it to him and he's had nothing but good things to say about it! The house shakes every time he watches a movie and he doesn't even have to turn it up high. It gets the job done and for the price I have no complaints at all!
5,Ill give it five stars cause its a wonderful subwoofer. After playing with it a little and finding the right settings it's a wonderful buy. One thing i have to gripe about is the mesh cover that comes with it. When bumping loud music you can hear it rattle. I remove it and it works great BUT the sub looks better with it on.
5,Bought an expensive sound bar by a high end brand that begins with “S” with a 6.5” subwoofer and wasn’t satisfied.  Added this to my Visio sound bar and am much happier
5,Great for the price.  Plenty of bass for most people.
5,A fine performing sub. It hasn't popped the first time! It really lights up the room! It's controls are easy enough to use and the connection was effortless.
5,Got this on sale for $99.Cant beat the performance for that price.Came in excellent new condition.Easy hookup.Was saving up for SVS Subs but could not pass up at this price for the meantime.Completely fills the man cave 16x19 room.I don't think I will need more costly subs for mostly movies and games.Fury and The Equalizer were awesome.
2,This product is not that great.  If all you want is a little bass with your TV viewing it is OK maybe.  It sounds fine flipping through the channels but as soon as you put on a movie or show with deep bass it makes burping sounds that are distracting even at low volumes on the receiver and the unit itself.  I regret buying it and it is well beyond the 30 day return period.  Remember you get what you pay for and this sub is cheap.  I recently watched Daredevil on Netflix and it reminded me that I don't like this product.
5,Ground sound and quality  for the price.. definitely recommend
5,This little sub is incredible for the money.  10/10 would buy again.
5,It works great and adds just enough bass to our surround sound system. Easy to set-up.
5,I'm really happy with this sub. I'm not a bass head and I think it's great for 99% of applications. If you're really into hip hop or dub step then maybe get the 12 but the ten will shake the house if I crank it. I have it matched with 4 polk towers and a polk center in a 5.1 and it's been great for both music and home theater.
5,Awesome sub for the money.  I paired it with a new Yamaha receiver and my old speakers and it sounds like a high dollar system.  I can easily get this to 'annoy the neighbors' volume and it still sounds clear and crisp.
5,Sounds good as expected of Polk quality.
5,Good for the size and location added to  a sound bar and built in ceiling speakers. Just the bass punch needed.Good price also.
4,This speaker works well with my system.
5,Provides a good amount of power & sound for an apartment and could also be used in a living room of a home. I ordered it for my daughter who got our old surround sound and only need this piece for the whole set-up since we kept our old subwoofer. They are using it in their apartment sounds quality is great.
5,Fantastic subwoofer! Even greater because of price. Wish it had LFE input but it can shake the bass in any normal sized room. I put it under my crawl space firing at the floor and it makes in-wall speakers much fuller for music and movies come to life with startling thunder!
5,Perfect for starting out in home audio good sound for small to medium sized spaces.
5,Wife bought me a Pioneer receiver for Christmas after my old one took what appeared to be a lighting hit... Anyway iI needed a powered sub and after looking and reading for several days I bought the Polk. So far so good. Love the sound. lots of power.. and really for the amazon price... you can't beat it... my family room is 28 x 15 and this covers that and then some.. hope this helpsG.
5,This baby rocks! Bought this for a friend while putting an entertainment system together for him. As a professional DJ I am very careful of what I buy for sound production. And I am always on the hunt for good value. This sub has it all. Dollar for dollar it goes over the top. You can spend more but for the average family in the living room this unit is a steal!
5,This made my computer speaker setup sound better than my living room stereo... So I bought another one. I got mine for $89 each and I feel like I got away with robbery. Get one now!!
5,I use it mainly for music with movies here and there. It does a great job delivering the lows like I wanted it to. Look good and good controls in the back.
5,I have a cheaper home theater in a box setup in my apartment the head unit died so I replaced it with a nicer Sony head unit. The old sub was not powered so I ordered this one. It is far nicer than I expected for $99. It may not be appropriate for someone with a super high end audio system but it is far nicer than most people would need sounds great and is plenty powerful.
5,Sounds Good
4,had a different smaller one initially.  I don't like the grill screen on this one.  It doesn't fit flush.  Hard to tell how well it does or doesn't work since subwoofers are supposed to be invisible.
4,Good bang for the buck.  Not a monster subwoofer but loud enough to match the other speakers in my home theater setup.
3,Great woofer for a small home theatre. Worked well for about two years then something went out on the circuit board. Sadly would cost almost as much to repair as it would cost to simply replace it.
5,I have two of these and think that they are the best bang for your subwoofer buck by far.  I also have two of the 12" version and those are a big step up from these.
5,Added the bass to my 5.2 A/V system with matching Polk center front and surround speaker.
5,This is a fantastic subwoofer
4,Great sub for the price. Connects with my sound bar and adds a nice bass sound
5,Perfect for my apartment!!
5,Such a good deal. Very loud decent sound quality perfect to fill in the low-end of my bookshelf speakers. At my suggestions at least 2 of my friends bought this same sub.
5,Easy plug and play install I bought this to replace a broken $400 sub that would have cost more to repair than to purchase this.  After reading the reviews I pulled the trigger and chose this (It was on sale at the time kind of helped the decision.)  Great sound from such a small package.  When you purchase it play Beastie Boys "Brass Monkey" I actually had to turn the subs volume down!
5,This was even better than I expected was bigger as well. For an idea of height this subwoofer is almost up to my knee. But the bass is so smooth and can get very deep if you want. You wont regret getting this. Turned the joy of listening to music into an experience.
5,Great sound
4,love it.  gives a great sound......bigger than it looks in the pictures so take that into account.
5,Not an expert in this field but it gave me what I was searching for great sound!  simple and affordable.  No regrets.
5,The setup is painless and flexible - I had mine hooked up and working three minutes after I opened the box. This subwoofer works both with receivers that have a dedicated sub-out and with receivers that don't. The instruction manual is very clear regarding correct wiring that should cover the vast majority of setups.In terms of sound I've got no complaints. It produces a nice hefty OOMPF.I highly recommend this one.
5,Great product.
5,Pick up this little powerhouse for my system in the master bedroom. It is teamed with a pair of Klipsch RB41 II's who performed quite well on their own before this addition. If you have never listened to a system with a sub you owe it to yourself to audition a well configured system. The sound is completed with the subwoofer. It adds not only the obvious bass sound but completes the ambiance to my ear.
5,For 79$ I couldn't have found any better subwoofer. Works really well and has decent build (wood). If you are looking for a reasonably priced subwoofer with good sound quality output then this is it. I bought a Pioneer 8 inch subwoofer before and paid close to 120$ and it sounded pretty terrible when compared to Polk PSW10. Has speaker input and output for old school receivers (with no pre-out's). All in all a great buy.
5,I picked this sub up on Amazon for $99 a year or so ago and have it as part of a home office sound set up. Good punchy bass to fill in where my desktop speakers (Def Tech ProMonitor 800s) can't go.It's only 50W so it might not do well in a large room home theater set up but in a small to medium room it should do just fine.
5,Outstanding woofer for my home theater system it provides excellent bass.
3,It's a bit muddy and controls are vague. It's ok for the value but you're better served saving up and getting a more responsive better sounding subwoofer.
5,I know very little about speakers.  I just did a little research and review reading online.  I added this subwoofer to my existing 5 zone speaker system that is wired into the walls and ceiling in my living room.  I should have added this subwoofer years ago.  I'm very happy with the results.
5,For the price there is nothing I can find to complain about. Bass is deep booming and rocks my loft where I use it with two Monoprice speakers to play Rockband. I run RCA cables from my little Audiosource amp to the inputs of the PSW10  and put the volume level at 10 o'clock. This gives me more than enough thump to have a great time.
5,Love this sub. Added a second for a more powerful bass experience with my ATMOS system. Highly recommended. Brother bought one as well and he is blown away with the deep bass and amazing look to this subwoofer.
4,Great range and power but hard to get it sounding proper. I've got it hooked up to my vinyl set up and It has brought a lot of my sound the nice low ends my speakers were lacking.
5,This is perfect in my small room with it's home theater setup. I use Minimus-7 front speakers RCA center with Linaeum tweeters (terrific cost/performance) etc. This sub woofer fills in the lower midrange and bass flawlessly at a very reasonable price. I couldn't be more pleased..
5,Amazing bang for your buck with this sub. Is it the best? No but if you just want to add some great thundering bass to your home theater without taking out a second mortgage then this is a great fit.
3,this subwoofer is really good not at first but i dont know why but alot of subwoofer brands are putting a grill on the inside of the port for some odd reason but i really dont know so i took the subwoofer back plate of removed that grill and heard no more distortion coming out of the port stuffed it with a little more foam and it works just fine i think its the best bang for its buck i personally like the infinity subs the best the 8' are perfect good response and crisp bass
5,Bought it heard it loved it the bass was way too much had to turn it down a bunch but now it's perfect. Getting a lot for the money with this woofer. Great addition for budget theater or even a high end one. I'm using klipsch surround Denon head unit works great on the 7.1 setup.
5,Can't be beat for the price. Just awesome.
5,I paired the woofer with some other Polk Audio speakers and I am very happy with my choice. This speaker really pumps out the bass.
5,I like this little sub and it's speed enough to buy another for a stereo pair to go underneath my Shahinian Oblisks getting rid of the HUGE isobarics I have been using for 20 years.
5,Best sub I've ever owned for the money!
5,This sub sounds louder than it should. I run a Video Production company and the Polk PSW10 with M-Audio AV 40's are a match made in heaven. They sound great out of my Mac Pro Tower I ran a 1/8th inch Y cable to each of the sub and AV40s You can adjust each individually with their volume levels and mix them as needed. No distortion and is an amazing value for the price.Tony
5,Love this subwoofer! I connected it to an about 16 year old receiver and it was awesome. Then I bought a Polk center and a new Yamaha receiver and wow did it really keep up with everything else. I really enjoy this sub a lot! Don't forget to order the cable along with it though. It is sold separately and much more if you just run out and buy it like I had too.
5,Amazing sound quality & amazing bass for the price!
5,Very happy with the product
5,It was a bit larger than expected  but so was the bass.
5,This sub is great. I have a large home and there is not a place in the house that I can't hear it and it is only at 50%. I couldn't imagine needing anything bigger. This added some much needed depth to my sound system. They price was also amazing. I let my receiver do all of the cross over throttling because I can but this sub can do it all by itself.
4,I really didnt expect this to be so large. It's actually a bit of a drawback. But otherwise it really gets the job done!
4,I've connected it with my ONKYO 7:1 system. Excellent quality at this price. I would recommend this to everyone (except Professional quality seekers). I would have given 1 more star if it had performed well for minute details. But for general audience this is perfect. They won't find the difference.
4,It's got the beef and good roundness
5,Don't know why I've always felt buying a sub-woofer was risky; it seems like such a "big" decision.  Whether that's true or not I ordered this one.  For the price (compared to others) wasn't totally sure I'd be happy.  Well good news.  Love it!
5,It's bigger than I thought. I like that it has on/off/stand by.
5,After reading several reviews I finally ordered this from Amazon.com. I was replacing an old Yamaha sub that was cutting out periodically. I felt at ease after reading the reviews. This is an amazing product with incredible sound. I have it turned down very low and it still quakes the entire living room during explosive movie scenes. I highly recommend this sub for it's sound and quality build. The price on Amazon can't be beat.
5,Have it as part of a home AV system and movies sound great...the games the family plays on the PS4 benefit as well.  Nice and deep.  Musically they are not the item I would pick....it works but does not do Vivaldi justice.....
5,This is a great sub for a smaller room.  I purchased it for my office and it's wonderful there.  It will bottom out if you have the volume up too high so I wouldn't recommend it for a larger room.
5,When my old powered subwoofer went out I first went to Crutchfield and found an "Out of Box" subwoofer for $149.  This seemed like a good price but I always check Amazon before I buy anything and I'm so happy I did.  The Polk subwoofer is perfect in my living room and for $89 I couldn't pass it up.  Set up was very easy and only took a few minutes.  I am VERY happy with this purchase!!
5,Have previously owned the same item  I had no qualms about buying another.  Fits where I wanted it and really adds to the sound.
5,Its great for the $$$
4,it is a nice subwoofer after I order it they mark it down $20
5,Sweet sub woofer. Really ties into the rest of my sound system. Bought about a year ago still going strong. Nice product. Would definitely buy again.
5,Thundering Bass- simply awesome for a theater system or music. I like the additional controls for Bass level and also the auto on off feature. For sure a quality Polk Audio product!
5,solid bass. clear defined works nice with a 17 watt tube amp
5,I've used this for a year and am still impressed with this powerful speaker. For the price this is the one!
5,Does what it sys and more exceeded my expectations!
4,Easy set up. Sounds great!
5,I love this subwoofer. I bought one for our home theater in our basement and liked it so much I bought another one for upstairs. Great sound and value for the price.
5,Fantastic sub for the price. Using this as my rear sub in 7.2 setup and it hits really hard in its corner-loaded position without any distortion at reference levels. Best setup = Phase 0; Crossover 80 dB.
5,If I had all night to write about how great this sub is I certainly could. This thing can really shake a house and awesome clear sound too. My auxiliary with the adapter was split to multiple inputs before running through this subwoofer but it still amplified the music completely and could be heard clearly outside about fifty feet from the house. I highly recommend this to anybody looking for a really impressive bass.
5,I bought this to go along with my budget home theater I was building. For the price there was nothing similar.Pros:Very crispGreat volume I have to keep it turned downFills up my living room perfectly (15'x25').Great priceCons:The auto on feature seems like it doesn't play well with my receiver.Shakes the pictures on the wall (this is a joke of course here comes the BOOM).
5,This Sud is good  I had  it installed  this weekend  and  guy's  this  is  a kicker  of  a speaker  it carries  the  bass though the house  and  floors  so you  may have to  turn it  downoverall very satisfied with  the  sound
5,I'm no audiophile but to my uninitiated ears this subwoofer sounds great.  This is in a medium sized living room and paired with some panasonic speakers that came with the previous home theatre system.  It is hooked up to a sony receiver with 7.1 surround.  We have no complaints!  Great price too when I bought it (below 85).  Too bad the price has been driven up since then.
5,I purchased this via amazon for 69 bucks.  I have it sitting in the corner of my room (my main speakers have 15" woofers).  For normal tv listening I have it set to about 45% volume and for movie watching I will turn it up to about 60%.  As others have noted if you turn it up too loud it is very boomy.  Best Boom for the price ....
5,WELL worth the $ I spend for this. I call it my "neighbor hater" as the bass/lows just come through with an awesome amount of support to the rest of the home audio. Also looks very sleep next to any dark furniture or components that you have connected. Polk Audio has a new fan. I heard all the good reviews about their products it's now been proven to me that they were valid!
5,Lover this sub. I chose this as a replacement for an Infinity 200 watt sub that stopped working. I read the other reviews and decided to give it a try. I'm very happy that I made this choice. This sub really enhances my other home theatre components which are a Yamaha Receiver and five Klipsch speakers. I won't hesitate to purchase another one since my home theatre sound remarkably better.
5,It sounds pretty good with my 5.1 surround sound. have it hooked up to a Denon AVR 391 in a dorm room. It's pretty loud sounds relatively clear. I'm pretty sure that the acoustics in my room are terrible which probably detract from it a little. But it shipped fast works perfectly and is not overkill for my purpose.  I don't use the amp in the sub so i cant comment on how good or bad it is.
4,For it size it awsumI give a 4 pluss star ratingOut of 5For a 10 inch sub can pass for a 12Was out side of a brick house an could hear it lows  an it was turn downGood luck with the people next door
5,Really brings out the bass adding to my Home Theater Sound.
4,Works as advertised - plenty of power and a nice complement to my Magnapan MMRWs
5,This thing thumps for the price.
5,I have been enjoying this woofer for about a month now and it really bumps. I live in a one bedroom apartment and it sounds great only one noise complaint :)I have a Polk Audio Center Channel Two Sony Tower Speakers and they are being powered with the Yamaha RX-V471. The built-in amp more than suffices and I have yet had the need to "crank it". For the price-point I definitely recommend this product.
5,Great value for the price. Would definitely buy again but I doubt I will need to. Definitely loud enough for my medium to large livingroom.
5,Great quality for the price. Was surprised. Paired with some Edifiers.
5,Plenty of punch to beef up my 8” three way fronts.
5,This thing is wonderful. The box is a lot bigger than i would have expected for a ten though but it makes up for it with it's rich bass and hard hits. Compared to the two 12's in my car it can keep those strong low tones but doesn't hit as hard which in the long run sounds better and is less annoying. Very easy setup great sound great price. Get this thing.
5,I needed a sub for upstairs that could play music and movies. I have an older klipsch ksw10 in my basement. The Polk performs well with a bit crisper base at lower volumes. The klipsch 200w shows up at higher volumes. However for my upstairs the Polk was a nice surprise for the price
5,I had one of these for my home theater at my old house and when I moved into my new house it worked perfectly.  But then I tried it out on my home recording studio and found that it really helped with certain final mixes and mastering.  So I had to buy another one.  Can't beat the quality for price on this one.
5,Plugged the subwoofer cable into this thing and back into my receiver and I think I woke up all my neighbors it is very powerful!
5,Aside from the plastic cloth covered grill this sub is great. It's not meant for a huge room but attached to the old Realistic STA 2080 and 2 pairs of Monitor 70 series II Polks it sounds like a much bigger sub. No distortion at high levels either. It will shake a 20 x 20 room with little effort.
5,Not sure why you would want more. It's boomy and fills the basement with vibrating bass. I'm not a fan of overwhelming subs but you could set this to overwhelm if you chose to. For $100 bucks it's the best buy of the year. Love it and love the fwd port enables me to put the sub against a wall. PERFECT. Buy it.
5,As a former concert reviewer whose ears have blown out by the likes of Metallica Pearl Jam Brooks and Dunn and Garth Brooks (all play at volume 11) the bass from this is great -- far better than my Kenwood system.  That's at lower volumes. If you crank it up to concert sound not as crisp and clear. Since I don't do that anymore this is a gem at a great price.
5,I bought this subwoofer 3 years ago to pair with my Sony SS-B3000 Bookshelf Speakers and Lepai 2020A+ T-Amp and it performs quite wonderfully. Only subwoofer I've tried in this setup but it's the only one I've needed to try. Performs wonderfully and when you put your head in the cone it even feels like a music-hat! How wonderful is that?!
5,This is a great sub for the price. I have it sitting up in a loft area where my dj equipment is and it fills the room perfectly. I live in a townhouse so i can't crank it but i have it almost half way and am surprised how much power this thing has even at that level. If you are looking to add this for computer or TV uses - it's plenty.
5,Makes my music full.  I like to think that I am "feeling" a slight vibration.  Don't really want vibration - makes my family not happy ;-} Instructions were good and the web site filled the rest of my questions.  I read several questions and reviews prior to my purchase.  Thanks to all for contributing on the item.
5,Works great with my Onkyo receiver and RCA speakers for a great surround sound unit. I would highly recommend this unit.
5,Holy crap this sub is awesome for $100.  Paired with klipsch r 15m front and rears and a klipsch rc 10 center Yamaha reciever. This thing makes movies awesome.
5,This is an excellent subwoofer - both for the sound quality and the price that I got it for! It's a fantastic complement to my home theatre system - I have configured my own with Klipsch Quintet 5 speakers a Pioneer VSX-1022 Receiver and this beautiful subwoofer! Its worked non-stop ever since I bought it...and its on every day!! I hope it continues to work the same way in the future!
4,it works really good i love mine
5,Product was great but quality of shipping and handling very poor.
5,Exceeded expectations! Researched other similar speakers and found the Polk Audio was rated highly and was best “bass” for the buck.
4,I think I got this for about a hundred bucks on Amazon and for the price it's probably hard to beat.  I keep the volume at about 50% and it's more than enough bass to rumble the walls.  Great sub...would recommend to anyone in the price point.
2,It's not a bad subwoofer for the price but if you turn it up very loud the speaker has distortion. It will sound fine however if you keep the volume low. I have 2 subwoofers and if I turn down one I have to turn down the other also so the music will be mixed correctly.
5,I really don't know much about stereo equiptment.  I do know that the subwoofer that came with my system died so I purchased this as a replacement.  This is MUCH more powerful than the one I previously owned.  It can shake the house.  So I'd say if you are in need go for this one.  Ya just can't beat this price!  (PS I do not use this with a home theater system just audio.)
5,This Polk Sub is the bomb! Amazon.com is the bomb! This is one of two PSW10's on a dual sub home theater system that rocks the house and these subs make it happen. (If you have the space) No better unit for the price and since I did my homework couldn't find it for a lower price at the time anywhere else. Service was also great since it actually arrived before the estimated arrival date.
5,Very impressed. Great bass for the price
5,I am an audiophile from way back. Built my first amp from a kit at age 12. Okay this is not a Velodyne but for $88 delivered when it sold averagely for $199 a few years ago how can you go wrong. I have spent almost this much on shipping for subwoofers I have purchased in the past. One thing in audio that has not changed in 35 years. If you wait long enough you can "steal" some good gear.
5,Great sub woofer i got 2 of them.and the bass is beyond powerfull
5,Sounds great. Nice deep rumble without a distortion pop. My old subwoofer would pop a lot so this is a huge improvement.
5,Sounds great with my other Polk Audio speakers.
5,I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of bass out of this product especially at the price point. I use it as part of my surround sound setup by connecting it via my AVR. It works like a dream. It provides the perfect bass for action movies it will rattle the room and it tunes right down for the hours of Barney that our toddlers put us through during the day.
5,Got on sale for 80$. Amazing subwoofer. Deep bass no distortion at all  even ah higher volume.  Lots of controls an input/output connections. Perfect size and nice finish.
4,Its good but  tye port noise can be a bit much sometimes
5,What a great sub and a great deal. I now get why all of the great reviews on this sub. Going from a JBL 12" to this was kind of a step down rumble-wise but clarity-wise a step up. We tested using Man of Steel and were pleasantly blown away. Great for small rooms. I'm going to get a second one.
5,Powerful sub. My walls rattle and had to turn down the volume. Made a big difference when I moved the sub to the corner of the room
4,POLK SYSTEM TOO MUCH FOR THE SMALL SYSTEM THAT I PURCHASED IT FOR (ONKYO CS-445 CD RECEIVER SYSTEM). THIS UNIT WOULD BE WELL SUITED FOR ANY UNIT ABOVE 100 WATTS. WHEN I GET MY NEW SYSTEM I'LL TRY THIS OUT BEFORE I BUY A NEW SUB-WOOFER.
5,You can’t  beat it for the price.
5,Replaces an old powered sub woofer that began to rattle. I needed to get a male RCA to 2 male RCA y cable to connect it but once I got it hooked up it sounds better than my old sub woofer ever sounded.
5,Sounds really good for the money I also have the 10in SVS ported which was 5 times the cost and not 5 times better.
5,Great sound decorative appearance.  Good quality structure and value
5,Agonized over what subwoofer to buy. Looked and read reviews for days. Finally decided on this one. Perfect for my first home theater system If you are debating or just getting started this is the subwoofer for you. Easy set up and great sound.
1,Had a piece of loose wood rattling around inside the cabinet that I managed to shake out through the porthole. The piece of wood had two brads in it and glue on it so I assume it was a cleat from inside the cabinet than wasn't attached properly and came loose. I decided to try it anyway so I hooked it up and played some bass-heavy tunes I had handy (Frank Zappa and Dave Martone by gawd). The sound was distorted...very distorted. Almost buzzing. Maybe the loose cleat+brads had torn/scratched the diaphragm where it wasn't visible. Or maybe there was some other problem in addition to the cabinet defect. Or maybe the people who rate this thing highly have tin ears. With a loose cleat stuck in them. Anyway I returned it and got a Dayton sub  for a few bucks more that sounds perfect without barfing chunks of forestry. Just a lesson that category Best Sellers might just be sucker food.
5,Great Home theater sub for a great price. gives you tons of bass if you want it. Fully adjustable bass control sounds great and plays flawlessly if your looking for a good budget sub for your home theater just to give it some more low end buy this you wont be disapointed
4,makes movies sound so much better now with this little but powerful sub. would recommend this to someone that wants to add some bass to movies with an older surround sound or to someone that is looking for a a inexpensive subwith a lot of punch.
5,I have a very basic system with some Bose 201's and moved to a home with a large great room.  Adding this subwoofer gave me just the base I needed to balance out what was lost in a large space.  But do beware that this sub will put off a lot of base if you turn the base adjustment to full.  If your not an audio nut you won't be able to tell the difference between this and a much higher end standalone sub.
5,adjustable from sane to insane levels of bass.
5,Best sub for price out there.
3,The PSW10 it good if you don't want bass heavy sound (I love watching movies with a ton of bass).  It vibrates the port heavily at high gain and sounds very muffled during bass heavy scenes or songs.  Traded it in for a PSW505 and couldn't be happier.  I'd spend the extra $100 and get the 505.
5,This sub bring life to my HT. Very nice material used on the box. Could have a rubber suspension but the actual one does the job.
5,I didn’t buy this speaker to shake the rafters. I just bought it to get some clean bass into my surround system. Great speaker at a great price.
5,This subwoofer is just the right size for a medium sized living room.  I use it with  a digital 5.1 receiver and it works great and you are capable of adjusting the range and sound of the subwoofer - from heavy to light.  The blue-ray dvd movies sound so much better with this subwoofer.  I've tried other subwoofers but they don't come close to sounding like this one.
5,I got this subwoofer after my Pioneer died on me. I needed something for my surround sound and didnt want to spend too much. I was extremely surprised on how good this sounds. Very deep bass and good crossover for pretty much everything from movies and games. I am very happy with my purchase and definitely recommend this subwoofer to anyone looking for something that sounds great good quality on a budget.
4,Price was right sound quality is good.
5,Great bass sounds good with blueray tv radio and cds.  It sounds great even at low volume.  I live in a two story house and with the volume on low the bass goes right through the floor onto the second floor. The first time I did this I had to check the volume to see if it was too loud for the neightbors.  It is an outstanding product for a great price.
4,well built good sound but settings are a bit confusing
5,You won’t find a better deal.
5,Worked great right out of the box with my Yamaha receiver. I did not even have to adjust it. It is a bit bigger than I imagined though so you might want to check available space to make sure you have room.
4,Sounds great
4,Good for a small room easy to set up
4,Nice warehouse pickup of a decent low-end low ender. Great boom for the buck.
5,Sounds very good with both movies and music. It has more than enough power for most people. I don't need heart attack level base at home. Well constructed and has a nice finish. Definitely a must for a budget minded system.Paired with Sony STRDH550 and Fluance SXHTB-BK.
5,I would definitely recommend this speaker if your looking for some nice bass to add to your office or home studio. It really sounds great for 99 buck!
5,Sounds great. I've adjusted my receiver so it doesn't shake our room too much. Love being able to feel the bass in my chest while watching the opening scene in James Bond's Spectre.
5,Sounds good when used with our small sony speakers
5,if you like bass and don't mind the neighbors complaining then these should work for you they sound great in your car too.
5,these speakers are well worth the money. great quality and amazing sound. The bass is amazing even at low volumes. Will be buying more of Polk's products.
5,For a hundred bucks this subwoofer is working great in my modest home setup.  Plenty of bottom to the sound without shaking the drywall to bits.  Quite satisfied.
3,I bought this subwoofer to replace my original non powered subwoofer that comes with the home theater. It has definitely boosted bass and added some punch but poorly handles low frequencies below 60 Hz. Specially when watching movies it starts to rattle & shake which ruins the occasion.
3,For the power it does good. But with the real low bass it overworks (even on movies) Some of the low end bass becomes distorted. If your wanting a sub for a good price for a smaller room this is nice. But in a room like my 24x12 you have to push it to hard.
4,I guess it is my own fault for not paying attention to the speaker dimensions but it is much bigger than my previous 10 inch subwoofer.  Can't complain about anything else.
5,Great bass when paired with decent amp and speakers. Will bump the pictures off the walls it gets so deep and rumbly
5,At this price point this sub does a superb job of delivering powerful deep bass. I have this sub connected to my home stereo system driven by an entry level Denon receiver. It works very well when watching TV and movies and does a very good job with music. As an entry-level powered sub I would certainly recommend this sub to anyone looking for solid power and sound. I love it.
5,Does a fine job filling up a rec/media room about 20x25.  I like its versatility -- in offering several alternatives for connection as well as an adjustable low pass filter.  I originally used it to tap off an old beloved high fidelity stero amplifier and more recently a Harman Kardon 7-channel receiver.  It is a competent part of a very nice-sounding media set-up.  I would buy again.
1,This thing sound terrible for music. Wish I would have paid attention to some of the more negative reviews. I thought maybe they were doing something wrong. I'm an audiophile but one on a budget. I have a large living room that makes the budget part difficult. I spent a couple weeks tweaking the crossover and levels changed to premium cabling nothing made a difference. It just doesn't do well over 60 hrz or so. It sounded fine for explosions in The Last Jedi but any music in movies or otherwise sounds terrible. Expect to have zero bass drum in your music. This was my first venture into Polk which is very disappointing not going to jump to the 300 dollar one. Ended up getting the Sony SACS9 on sale for the same price and it's miles ahead of this.
5,Didn't really know what to expect when I bought this sub. I was inexpensive but seeing as though Polk Audio made it I figured it should perform well. I does a good job with both music and home theater. It won't rattle your walls but it sounds really good for the price. I've only heard it "chuffing" when the bass gets really low on some of the movies I watch. All in all great entry level sub for the price.
4,Best you can buy for the money -
5,Works good sounds good better than the kit subs
5,It's not the most powerful thing in the world but that's hardly the point. It just sounds incredible. Versatile set up helps it perfectly blend in with the rest of your system. If you're looking for something that will thud the house off its foundation at the threshold of pain this isn't it but there's no denying how sweet it sounds in a more conventional and subtle set up.
5,I am impressed. The multiple inputs and outputs along with the adjustable crossover make this quite versatile and the sound quality is excellent for the price tag.
5,Works great as expected.  My other woofer died after 12 years of service.  It was a down firing one.  There is a difference in sound as my old one was so strong it would vibrate the walls in the upstairs room.  This one is just right.
5,I have an inexpensive older Denon unit inherited from the previous homeowner.  The addition of this subwoofer makes me feel as though I have a $5000 audio system!  That low frequency rumble that you feel in your chest is just great.  Bring on the loud movies!
5,De lo mejor! Sonido envolvente. Es una maravilla de equipo
5,This sub sounds as good as my Klipsch monster at lower volume. Perfect for bedroom. Plenty of punch.
4,Great addition to any stereo system.
4,Can't beat the price for the sound it produces. Boomy for me but great entry sub for the money. Tweaking it will improve the sound considerably Very well made.
4,Good sound not to be confused with more expensive systems but well worth the price.
5,Received this subwoofer quickly. Good quality and diversified! Easy to hook-up
5,Working real well. For someone who has never had any kind of speaker system when watching tv this sub-woofer is an awesome addition to my new home theater setup. It is fairly big though.
4,It's only 50 watts but boy is it accurate.  My music sounds a lot better and it's added a new dimension to movies.  You can't beat it for the price.  My room is about 15 x 22  and it's powerful enough at least for and old guy.
5,GREAT sound and window rattling bass - if you choose. Excellent addition to ANY sound system. Great value!!
5,Premium sound for a budget price.
5,This sub is great. The price point for what you get is well worth it. Sub has very clear sound at multiple frequency levels and set up n operation are easy. Only complaint is the box is a little big... (I also have it in a smaller room) If you want to buy a nice (sub) for a good price your safe with this guy.
5,Sounds great very pleased.  It is nice that it features a 3 way power switch so you can have it on auto-standby or just on or off.  At even high listening volume I haven't heard any distortion.
5,Great subwoofer for a low cost
3,It's ok I guess. It seems to have a hard time picking up a crossover of 100 even after I set the two fooor and two bookshelf speaker and center channel to 100 or even higher. It only really sounds decent with 5.1 sources or higher. 2 channel sources that simulate Dolby seems to not even get picked up by this woofer.
5,Pretty good bass for a 10" and the price. It's plenty loud for what I need. It shakes the whole house I've had to turn the sub itself down at times .
1,Only works when it feels like it. When it's not working it's still getting a signal (the cone vibrates very slightly enough to show that it's getting power and all but not doing much with it). Then apparently at whim it will turn on the most ungodly booming bass. It goes through these antics even though I don't touch anything about the setup or fiddle with the controls in any way. There may be some mystery setting which works better but I can't find it. But what do I know I'm only an acoustics engineer. I'm considering ripping out the electronics and using this as a passive sub since the driver and cabinet seem pretty decent but I haven't gotten around to it.
5,It says its rated max 100 watts its way more than that!Sounds great!Very happy would recommend  to any audio  enthusiast ! Great value!
5,Great sound for the size and price
5,For the price this can't be beat
5,Nice unit took a couple days of listening and adjusting to get it adjusted to the room and music I listen to
5,I was given a sound bar from a freind. I am not a sound guy but my tv just needed some base found this easy to hook up and boom I was blown away this base rocks my whole house movie theater efect I love it.
5,Buy this sub you won't regret it. It has a beautiful bass gets the background deep bass alsoSounds good on music or movies also you won't fine a sub this good for the price.
5,Solid quality with pleasant aesthetic for a reasonable price.
4,Delivers deep bass and rich mid tones.  The unit is larger than expected and just fits the space allocated.  Make sure the you measure before buying.  Connecting was a little different from past subwoofers that I have owned.  Well worth the cost though.
1,This sun is blown already after 2 Months.Of course the return window is closed and on a product this pricey it is upsetting!
5,I paired this Subwoofer with two A2s and I have a remarkable full range sound system. I have this set up in one of my bedrooms and the acoustics are fabulous!
5,I've had this for a while now  couldn't be happier. I haven't even needed to push it yet loud! I would buy this again for sure!
5,Easy to setup and add to my sound bar.
4,Love the sound and the thump. Occasionally I hear a little distortion but overall I'm satisfied with the purchase
5,These speakers sound great . Just one of these produces better tighter bass the the old 12" it replaced and i orderd a pair . So you can imagine how good they sound .
5,After a month a couple of parties and some good continuous use I can say that I'm very pleased.  Dual line sub input is not a problem just plug it in to one of them don't overthink it. Plug it in break it in and beat it up.  Smoking deal.  If you're looking don't wait.  Buy it.
5,It didn't blow the budget by any stretch and the sound is fantastic.  It's a very high quality product and I feel like I'm at the Filmore East listening to Cream from back in the day.
5,Had a sun fire amp conk out on me.  Bought this to get me through to next nice sub.May not get another sub.  Does great
5,This thing can punch if you want but more importantly it is clean and balanced.  Whether at a high or low volume you know this will nicely fill out any speaker system.  I used a splitter to connect to a single sub cable to my receiver.  Some say you don't need to but it is an option and will not hurt.  Only cost about 4 dollars.
5,This subwoofer replaced my very old Polk PSW350 sub that came with my RM-6600 Polk surround system (5 small satellite speakers 1 subwoofer). I was a little worried because of the wattage difference between this new sub and my PSW350. Folks there's nothing to worry about. This PSW10 is plenty powerful. It is a perfect replacement for the PSW350 in my opinion.
3,First I buy this sub just because the price tag is unbeatable secondly a built in slot in dining room is little tight therefore this cab fit well in there after half an hour of tunes I noticed this sub is far off compare to Sony and infinity however if you just wants bass feels for small room this is it. I'm a musician and have play music for over 30 years therefore the way I listen to music a little picky. Bottom line at below $100 you can't go wrong.
5,Many said this is not good enough for movies I disagree. True it is not going to make your ears bleed but if all you are looking for is some added effect this is more than enough especially for the price.
5,Meet my expectation! Love the bass sound!
5,I love this subwoofer I mean it. Besides the fact that I got it for around $70 makes it look better in my living room. In any case the sound is great and the volume is perfect for a small apartment like the one where a live in in fact I have never tried it beyond 60% of its full power. I highly recommend this subwoofer
5,Excellent subwoofer with a great price point.
5,replaced My 500 Watt Energy 12 Inch Sub With This One About 3 Weeks Ago. It His Just As Hard And Blends Perfectly With My Surround. It Looks Great Too.11-8-13:  added a second one to my system and along with the denon avr 1713 which has multiQ XT it is a perfect blend the booms sound like they are coming from each speaker rather than the subs.
5,Love it because it is great and affordable. My roommates are jealous for the loud boom I get from this sub. I played this straight from my laptop and it hits pretty good. I know there are tons of better quality but this will do for any fellas that likes the bass hit
4,nice workmanship. Husband is happy he is satisfied with sound. One of the better manufacturer I feel.
4,Connected to my home speaker system that had no base. This thing rocks and punches out some serious base watching a 5.1 surround sound movie in my basement with this cranked up is like being at the cinema I just love it !
5,Great price.  Well worth the cost at $100 or less. Sure helped to fill out the bottom end of my sound system in the den.  No problems with setup or install.
5,Bottom line: I'd buy it again and that is the highest praise I can give a product.  I am using it in a smaller room so I don't know if it would fill a grand hall.  But chances are if you have a grand hall in your home you can spring for more than the $81 I paid for it or so one may think.
5,Amazing subwoofer. Automatically upgraded and made my system better. It took the load off my speakers and made them better!
5,Unit showed up as advertised and provides great bass sound.
4,For the pricethis a a good Subwoofer for the average home systemunless you like bass that will rattle the window's.
5,I use this with a Vizio 38" soundbar and what a combination!  Sounds better than my home stereo...
5,Tremendo
5,The performance of the Polk Audio PSW10 Powered Subwoofer really surprising. Watching movies on DVD and Blu-Ray like The Ant-Men Mission:Impossible Rogue Nation Fant4stic The golden cane warrior (Thai martial art movie). Polk PSW10 provided deep powerful bass. For music playback Polk PSW10 was great. Polk Audio PSW10 prove to be responsive and scientific.
5,Wow this thing compliments my jbl and blow away my 48 lifestyle bose speakers
5,Hits loud and clear doesn't hit the lows like the highs but for the price and for a 10 inch sub I love it.
5,Solid performance at very good price. It WILL improve your setup.
4,Good entry level sub. Weather using in a surround sound setup or music play it works well. It will distort a little at high volumes but as stated it is an entry level sub.
5,Am very pleased with the quality of bass from this subwoofer.
5,Awesome speaker!
5,Tremendous sound quality at a great price
5,Polk somehow builds a great sub woofer and sells it for 100$.sounds wonderful. would be worth twice the price. These pulpies will. shake your window pains. Afraid to crank them up. You can litterally feel them pounding your body frame
4,Good sub for a cheap price.
5,WOW! I was very skeptical about buying this (even for as cheap as it was). I did not think it would work at all but it fills my mid-size living room with sound and adds a great amount of extra oomph for my vizio soundbar. Two things No remote and you will need to supply your own cable (you can pick up on here for about $7).
5,It's been in service for 5 weeks now and all is well.  Sound just as good as the JBL PSW-10 unit that it replaced but at one third the price.  All of the positive reviews seem to be spot on.  One nice feature is that it has an auto - on/off that only kicks the unit in when it is receiving the appropriate signal.
5,Fantastic sub for this price. Amazing really. I set the sub level @ half for calibration then turned it down a little.... This thing has plenty of bass for small to medium sized listening areas.I don't like the silver front behind the grill... But who cares. This thing just rocks.
4,I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN!
5,booming bass premiered it on the Spectre movie at the beginning when the building blows up.  this thing shook the house works as it should.
5,It is perfect bass is pure and deep plugged right in to my pioneer reciever and matched perfectly with my infinity speakers
5,Excellent bass sound for the size and price. I 'm a sound mixer and this bass sound close too a 18" sub woofer.
5,This rocks! I have it paired with an old set of 10" Cerwin Vega's through an Onkyo TX-SR313 receiver and it is solid! Nice solid lows and punchy.
5,This sucker booms. It's got a very clean sound and the pricepoint is hard to beat. Love my Polk setup.
4,Hard to beat for a 10 in sub under 100 bucks. Worth every penny
5,Great sound . Great deal.
5,Great 10-inch subwoofer for a home theater set up. Provides enough power to round out any 5.1 or 7.1 system. My current room is a 20x20 and this has been more than enough for it. It works well for the casual music listener as well.
5,Lots of options behind this subwoofer. Great choice.
3,I purchased this subwoofer based on the good reviews and the price point.  It gets plenty loud but is not tight and precise by any means.  It's muddy and boomy.  I've been moving it around the room to try to improve the sound but to no avail at this point.  It's acceptable (particularly since I did not have a subwoofer) but only average.It does do the job however.Note that the room it's in has a laminate floor so that may be related to the muddy sound.
5,Dits perfect into my system. Great sound!
3,as many others have said this subwoofer is a tremendous bang for your buck.  I bought for my entry level home theater so did not have too high of expectations but worked like a charm.  Unfortunately exactly 2 months after I bought it bass started to sound muddled and would cut in and out during movies then stopped working altogether.  I contacted Polk and they troubleshot it down to the fried amplifier and offer to mail another.  I'll wait to update the star rating depending on how they handle this return process.
5,Makes your home movies come to life.
5,Good
5,I wanted to really test this so I blasted both discs of Animusic.  (A good way to test any speakers) wow. Talk about bass.  Great with my Sony B3000s.  I just have an old Sherwood stereo receiver so I needed the speaker line connections. Wow again.  And I am  extra thankful that I live by myself because neighbors in an apartment would not be pleased.
5,Nothing
4,Easy to set up.
5,Using this on a computer and it sounds great.
4,good sub for the price.  Not mind blowing but fills the need for bass.
4,Maybe it deserves a five star I don't know.I got it for my outdoor TV and sound system and it works great.
5,Replaces a subwoofer that was not amplified.  The difference is wonderful.  I watched an action movie with lots of booming explosions rumbling vehicles etc. and it was like they were in the room with me.  Glad I made the change.
5,Great sub for the money. I use it on my back porch on the beach where salt air shortens the life of all electronics so the price was right for its end use and it sounds great.
5,Still using it after how many years?  Its best to use an equalizer on your PC to fine tune it.  Good with music. Not as good with movies on my pc.  It doesn't have that movie theater range when it comes to the low lows.
5,Great product - Great price !
5,Very good for the price
5,Really great bass and easy to set up. Fits nice under our side table so it's not an eye sore. It really adds to the sound of movies and music but not overpowering!  My husband is very picky and this is the first one he was happy with.
5,Sounds is fantastic big bong for your buck!! Clean bass even turned all the up get it and dont look back.
5,Excellent value. Replaced the original subwoofer from a high end satellite-sub system with no loss of sound quality.
5,I got 2 of these for $89.99 each they sound pretty good in a 16x16 mancave nice budget powered subs.
5,For the price this subwoofer sounds amazing has different settings and you are able to control specific bass sounds great with my home theater.
5,yes it is a 10 inch powered sub. work nicely dog doesnt like it and is scared of it but he doesnt pay the bills so i feel like he doesnt really get a say in the matter. i am happy he is not but like i said who cares what he thinks.
5,Hits hard for the price but can hear some Port noise
5,Great sub.  Sound and bud quality are good for the money.  You won't find anything close to this sub for the money.
5,Awesome subwoofer for the home theater system.  Adds some amazing bass a must for any system. I usually have to turn down the sub because it will shake the walls.
5,We hooked this up in our 15x10 movie room.  I was worried at first if it would be loud enough but it is definitely more than enough power for a room that size.  Everyone who has come over has commented on how great the sound system sounds with this subwoofer. Great bang for your buck with this sub.
5,Great sound for the price. Upgraded from a Yamaha sub to this and it blow it out of the water.
5,So far it's held up well.  I play my movies loud.  Lasted beyond the (name brand) that came with the stereo
5,Great sound and a great addition to any home theater.
4,Very happy and goodbye again.
5,Very good for the money!
5,Love it. Use it with a surround system for my deck. Open air space has excellent bass!!
5,Sound is great i had to turn it down so i could match ot with my other sub which is at max. Looks great and complements my home theater. My only regret is not buying 2 when they were in sale.
5,Had this up and running in 5 minutes. Material quality looks excellent and the sound quality is fantastic. Highly recommend this. Great quality great price.
5,I purchased this sub to replace the one that came with my Klipsch system (it had a short).  This sub is a monster in comparison.  If you want something that will rattle your windows with quality low end this is it; however you can also dial it back to be a quality addition to a more reserved home theater system.This is a good product at a great price.
5,Best sub for the price point.  You won't get a sub that sounds better or has the configurable options this one has in any competitor at similar prices.  I hunted for a long time for the perfect option for my apartment and this is it!
1,Do not fall for these silly reviews these people never heard real bass in their life. They are probably mostly older people. This subwoofer sucks and its veryyyyy WEAK. I mean its so weak you will hear it the moment you play it. What it does it focuses on a very specific high bass frequency to make you think its loud. However there is no real bass low freq or vibration. It is tuned to a very high frequency to fool your ears to thinking you are hearing bass. You are better off buying a logitech 2.1 PC speaker system than this high frequency basss junk subwoofer. Dont let them fool you!
5,Works well with my Denon receiver.
3,I wasn't blow away by the sub but its value is unbeatable.  It is perfect for smaller spaces or if you are upgrading from a cheap surround sound kit purchased at "wally world".  It does not come close to my SVS sub but I didn't buy it for that reason.  This sub works great for my kids gaming 5.1 surround sound system.
5,sounds great for the price!
5,It’s a perfect subwoofer for my needs. Lots of Base!I would highly recommend this product ..
5,Added this to my home that has a whole home audio speakers in the dealing to add some punch and it has worked out great!
5,Exactly what I needed for my outdoor patio speakers! Sound is now amazing
5,This thing can BOOM!  I am using it in an 18x24 foot living room and is certainly all I need.
5,Easy set up clear and easy instructions on installation and operation.  Read both your audio receiver and the speaker instructions to make it easy.
5,Great sub for the money. I replaced a 20 year old kenwood with this one and couldn't be happier. Let's hope it lasts 20 years. Great sound and a perfect combination to your home theatre system.
5,Really nice inexpensive woofer
5,I got this to accompany my M-Audio BX2-5 studio monitors I have connected to my PC.  I needed something to round out the low end and this does it quite well.  My music room is pretty small so I didn't need anything with overwhelming power.I own other Polk audio speakers for my 2 other sound systems and love them.
5,Sounds great. Volume control valuable. Fit well into my 5.0 system. A very good addition.
5,Phenomenal subwoofer. Just added to my basement home theater surround set up. The sound and response that comes from this subwoofer is Suprising. I have had more expensive speakers sound not nearly as good. Can't believe the quality considering the price. I feel like I stole it. Purely awesome. Buy buy buy. You won't regret it.
5,My $500 sub blew and I needed a new one. Didn't want to spend a ton of money and bought this one. All I can say is it ROCKS!!! you know its good when the wife is telling you to turn down the movie. I would have bought this one first time around but got sold on the bigger ticket one. My bad.
5,You owe it to yourself to enhance the music you enjoy.  Don't hesitate. These are great units at a great price.
5,When this thing gets going the bass shakes my house.
5,Fits perfectly great sounds and low price.  Easy to setup.  Plugged right into my receiver.  Highly Recommend.
5,the polk 10" sub is perfect for my needs. I have a unit that i use on the patio. the spearkers are a large size book shelf type so they blend together perfectly. Please keep in mind if buying this that it is only 10". dont expect 15" bass from a 10" sub. for the price size look and sound it was exactly what I was looking for
5,Absolutely love this thing. It thumps and enables real control over sound. Additionally is that it doesn't break the bank either.Easy to set up tune and provides a low end fill your bookshelf speakers simply cannot give you.
5,The Polk PSW10 is an AMAZING... It delivers excellent clean sound. I add this unit to my 7.1 Onkyo Home theater receiver and my Bose Acoustimass 10 Speakers and so far I have zero complains…  I Tested with Music Movies and Video Games. For the price and the size of this unit the quality of the sound in all areas is just impressive.
5,Great replacement for my 1970 state of the art Pyramid 12 inch subwoofer. Works great with Polk TSi100 Bookshelf speakers and CSI A4 Center Channel Speaker.Great surround sound with blue ray disks.
5,Love polks. I  always have. I think they are the best for the money. And this is a great frickin deal.
5,Fantastic sub. Best $100 I've ever spent!
4,This really puts out good bass for the price I paid.  It does have a little more reverberation that I like when you get the really long low booms in movies but overall it enhanced my the experience of my soundbar perfectly.
5,Fills very large great room with rich adjustable sound. Amazon dropped price by 20% immediately after ordered. Paired with Polk T15 speakers. Great value. Hope it lasts.
5,Have to say for the money spent which wasn't much this is a quality built sub. Performs well in a bedroom connected to a sound bar.  Love the automatic power on and off feature which my other brand sub I ordered last year didn't have.  Won't be disappointed
5,Very impressed for an inexpensive sub.
5,I listen to home theater and stereo in a moderate sized space and the PSW10 Subwoofer has simply ramped up my enjoyment of everything including Blue Ray DVD CD TV and vinyl. By tasking the PSW10 with the base and letting my Yamaha cover the mid-range and treble I am genuinely grooving on vinyls that I had given up on 30+ years ago.
5,Did my research and for price bought 2 of these and sound great adding deep sound to my home theater.
5,Not a million dollar sub but super easy to set up and pounds like a hammer! A must for movies and extra sweet for music
5,Works great easy to hook up.
5,Works Great for my home theater system. Great sound quality!
5,Good quality good sound good price!!!
5,I was passively looking for a subwoofer and found a great deal on this unit. Only paid $80 for this. The unit arrived as expected and literally was great bang for the buck. I have another Polk subwoofer unit (PSW111) and this unit was just as nice. Aesthetically the box looks more "wooden" but I don't mind that look. It's fairly large but packs a nice punch.
4,Really pleased by how much this budget item improved the sound of my system.
5,Very impressed with this sub..  Fills the room with great base and I am not using the amplified out puts.
5,We had a Yahama hooked up to are system first and it did ok but when we changed to the Polk the bass came thur more and had a overall better sound. Very pleased.
5,Great speaker for the money
5,Order The TSi200 bookshelf speakers and this sub.  I can't say how they would fill up a large area (cuz I don't have one) but you won't be disappointed with the sound in an average sized house.  I can't believe I bought these speakers on-line never having heard them.  The reviews were good I took a chance I'm a happy boy.
5,Bang for the buck !I've added this to my Yamaha Rx-v379 av receiver.It adds excellent base. You can feel the good base on lows as good as in the highs.
5,This adds so much to the overall sound quality of a system. Highly recommend.
5,Excellent  all the way.
4,Great subwoofer!!!! Had it for years and it is still going strong.
5,As good as the reviews say it is!! Mixes well with my theater!i removed my large old floor speakers and am only using a Samsung soundbar and this sub. Don't expect loud booming bass because that isn't what this sub is about. It is meant to fill your mids and highs with full rich sounding bass. Very nice affordable product from Polk Audio.
5,It sounds great and fills in the bottom end of the frequency range that my speakers just can’t.  It really makes the most of movie audio and surround sound.
5,This subwoofer completed my office sound system perfectly.  Typical Polk quality of construction and sound.  Easy set-up that works just fine with my very basic Insignia (BEST BUY) receiver that has no dedicated output for a subwoofer.  Sound is tight and clear.
5,Absolutely brought the base alive. I was using a passive sub woofer and did not realize how useless it was. I am impressed with the difference this speaker makes in the sound and experience of TV and movies.
5,Love the bass this sub produce. Heard what it could do and new I had to have one.
4,Great price for decent bass - feels a little mushy at time though - but can't beat it for the price...
5,Great sound and great price
5,Can't beat the price for this gem.  Excellent boom for the price.  Definitely recommend this subwoofer if you are on a budget.  You won't be disappointed.  @jlindeman01
5,I bought it connected it and LOVED it!! took my home theater to the NEXT level!!
5,This is my first subwoofer purchase and I couldn't be happier. Just hooked it up and it is phenomenal. The quality of the construction and outstanding performance make it an amazing addition to any stereo or home theater setup. I was lucky to get mine on a special sale price ($69) here on Amazon which makes it even better! I highly recommend this subwoofer!
5,Hard to beat this for value.  I use it on my patio and it performs perfectly for the application and at the price point.
5,i've used one of these for 4 years it has an amazing frequency response in the low and high range. perfect for any home theater!
5,I thought I would try these but nervous due to the low price but turned out sounded good so I got a second
5,The bass on this more then meets my needs.  I tested it out on a variety of different music as well as a couple games where the bass would be utilized.  The sound came through very well and came well within my expectations.
5,so happy with this subwoofer.  looks great.  has 2 RCA inputs (R & L).  i purchased a 'y' splitter RCA cable as my receiver manufacturer (yamaha) suggested. sounds awesome.  a great value. the bass hits tight.  for $95 its a bang for your buck.
5,Gets the job done!
5,This thing is heavy and large I was surprised how large.  With the subwoofer cable I was able to hook it up in about a minute.  It makes a great bass even when the volume is low both for my music and my movies.
4,The color is plain and doesn't match the decor of our living room but it was a great deal of savings to choose this one over the cherry. Took a while to figure out the wiring but now it works and adds true depth to our sound.
5,Great sound for the price!
5,I liked the sound and value of this subwoofer so much that this is the second one that I purchased. This model was recommended to me by a friend that installs home systems and distributed audio systems.
1,I'm not sure why there are so many glowing reviews about this product it may be that my standards for sound are higher or maybe some of the reviewers aren't so honest - either way I felt obligated to post about this product for those looking for a lower-end sub. I received the sub a day or so ago and immediately plugged it into my receiver. At first I was surprised at the bass coming from the speaker...when someone was talking. However once it came to any movie action scene or hip-hop music this sub fell really really short. When I attempted to turn the volume up past 1/3 of the max it just sounded like someone slapping against the box. The bass wasn't clear it was very muffled and sounded awful. In good faith I could not recommend this product to anyone and look myself in the mirror.Now if you're looking for a very and I mean very low level of bass this speaker MIGHT work for you.
5,What can I say this baby sounds good! Gets thumping without sounding trashy. I mostly use it for music and it works well for that.
5,I just can go in to specs and tech details . all I can hear coming from this sub is a nice bass that made  my movie experiences more exciting even the kids hear and feel the thump of movies that they saw before but never hear like is with this add on to the home theater system.
5,I used in my 2 car garage and I now will most likely need to apologize to my neighbors.
4,I bought this because I wanted a good cheap sub for my new reciever.  This one works.  I'm not an audiophile so I can't say the limits of it but it does rock the house and provides more bass then I need without cranking it up.
5,Got this to use with our tv av receiver.  Its more than adequate for basic use. Very reasonable pricewise and provided lots of bass.  Obviously not a high end component but for a basic system its very cost effective.  We combine it with a pair of acoustic research m4 speakers and some pioneer av speakers in a 5.1 setup.
5,Fantastic speaker! Sounds great and is a good addition to my home theater system. It does take up a bit of floor space which was fixed after I found that it fit nicely under one of my end tables.  Still full sound effects and out of the way.  Wife is happy now.
4,Edited:Fixed humming by switching power supply to one different from receiver.
4,Makes such a difference having this unit to add to my surround sound.
5,For the money it was the best rated and I was not disappointed. Great unit for the surround system.
4,"Unbelievable at this price!"If your looking for a really good subwoofer on a tight budget you won't go wrong here. I matched it up with a set of Klipsch Quintet II's* for about $200 and an Onkyo TX SR505 Home theater receiver at about $240 and came up with a new system for about $550 that knocked my socks off!*Discontinued? Mall electronic chain store has Quintet III's at $499 and the difference is negligible.
5,By far the best budget subwoofer I have ever heard. This thing really bumps. I am using this for my PC setup with my Orb Audio Booster mini amp and Klipsch R-14m bookshelf speakers. One word: perfect.
3,This is not a true subwoofer it does not reach into your gutsas a true subwoofer would.it is however a very good bass module.that can substatue until you can get a real gut wrenching one. But if you don't care for such it will serve u well.
5,Hope your neighbors like the same music as you.  This thing is loud. It will shake the shingles off your roof. Very good low end sub woofer.
5,Bass feels like a thonder  love it
5,Best subwoofer I've ever owned. This thing bangs! Way more than I need for the 600 sq. foot room. I got a Levy receiver with some Polk bookshelf speakers to go with it and I love the setup.
5,I have two of these and a 12 inch in my living room sounds just like him at the movies and then some
5,Sounds great. Wow what a price. Bumps strong throughout whole house. Thought I needed bigger (12") nah this thing rocks and sounds clean.
5,Great for the price
5,Awesome bass sound especially for the price.
5,Worth every penny and as cheap as this sub is I really mean it. Top quality buy it.
5,worth every penny of  $79  dollars  .i love  it  an price  .may buy another  before  price change
5,This is a great subwoofer for the price! The music and the movies sound incredible and I can't even turn it up to half the volume without worrying about bothering the neighbors. I have a couple of Polk Audio bookshelf speakers so I knew the quality would be exceptional. I am very happy that I purchased this subwoofer!!
5,Great sub for the money has good bass. Made out of solid materials. Expect this quality out of Polk Audio.
5,I installed this powered sub to supplement the low end of my sound system at the rears.  I don't think I could have done that so well with another product at $100.  You will get a little distortion if you have it up too high  but you can make adjustments with the volume knob to adapt to your system and room needs.
5,Paired with my old Polk Audio speakers and I love the surround sound.
4,LIKED THE PRICE !  FITS IN WELL WITH MY SYSTEM.
4,Just installed it so I will give 4 stars. I will report back in a few months to let you know if it is holding up.
5,I use this sub for gigs. Guitar vocals and this sub fills in like a drummer on stage.
5,i dont know if it is possible to go wrong with a polk product. i have the psw10 working with sony bookshelf speakers and it sounds great. very smooth low end reproduction. and for the money i dont see how you could beat it. on top of that the thing looks graet too. simple look with the cover on and formidable without the cover.
5,This sub is an incredible great product and value for the money.  I got it for $100 and couldn't be happier.  I previously had a JBL sub that stopped working after 10 years and paid $500 for.  I get very similar bass out of the polk audio sub as i did with the JBL.  Very happy.  Incredible value.
5,So far so good.  I had a 7.1 channel receiver and it lacked the lower end sounds I needed to make the most of my movie and music collections.  You won't be disappointed with this one.
5,For under $100 this subwoofer is amazing if your looking for a quality sounding sub this is it.this is one the best subwoofers I've owned and at this price it's a steal
2,Let me start by saying this sub is not horrible it just did not have the "punch in the chest" I desired.  I gave the PSW10 a fair three days to kind of break it in with hopes of more depth and when it never came I packed it up and off it went.  I was on a budget to stay under $150.00 but after hours of research I decided to explore the $188.00 BIC America F12.  I have to say it is like night and day!!!  This 12" subwoofer packed a huge punch.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  If you just want to add a little bass to your HT then the PSW10 will be a fine fit at a great price.  If you are looking for a subwoofer that will quench a deep thirst for some great bass at an awesome price the F12 is what you desire.  Always remember you "usually" get what you pay for.  I hope this helps.
5,This subwoofer is awesome.  It picks up all the notes continuous that a 12 in subwoofer won't do. It's very strong and works hard. I'm about to purchase another one and add more pressure in my living room.  Awesome subwoofer.
5,After using this product for almost a year I can say it throws some serious bass. I use it under my patio in my bar. Very clean. Only flaw is that the face cover prongs broke from the amount of bass it produced. No biggie I super glued them back on and the face is like new.
5,Really completes the theater room sound system.
5,Bought this to complement my Athena Technologies Point Five home theater system I purchased back in the Amazon stone ages.  Gives me all the low end I want for my 300 sq. ft room.  May be lacking for those who have larger viewing rooms or prefer booming low frequencies.  But for ~$100 and often less you can't go wrong with the PSW 10.
5,I found these on clearance. I love them easy installation.
5,This sub has great bass.
5,Had this sub for a few years now and its still going strong. Sounds great and impressive bass for a small sub plus you just cant beat the price.
4,Great quality for the price.  Sounds great in my front room at medium volume.
5,Works as expected. Adds depth to the music and enriches the listening experience. Make sure you get cables to hook it up to your receiver.
4,I received a set of built in speakers as a Cristmas gift. We just wall mounted the TV.Everything sounded good but it lacked the boom on bluerays.The Polk PSW-10 worked great in our 25x15 great room.The price was better than I expected from Amazon.
4,For the money I paid and the size of my room it is a perfect fit(my room size is 13 feet by 13 feet).  I had no problem installing it or operating it.  I like the sound quality and it adds to the movie experience. Overall I believe it was a good purchase.
4,Great sub. Title is misleading. Says black but I received silver.
5,sounds great i have got two sw an infinity and this on;  too much better and its presence is felt at very low sound levels
5,$450 you can't beat the value well-made unit
5,I have a 'two subwoofer' processor but have never felt the need to add another to this little gem. I am running a lot of power through the rest of my system and this guy never grumbles'rumbles' or fails to match (after some initial fine tuning). I run my systems very hard and this guy is doing very well over a year in.
5,Nice subwoofer for the $100 range. I chose this over a similar Sony model. After listening to a few hours of music I couldn't be happier. I've got the sub in a smaller master bedroom and it does a really great job. Sound quality is terrific. I've only cranked it up a couple of times but it seems to do well under a louder load and still produce clear quality bass.
5,This is a great subwoofer for a great low price.  I was a bit worried about the quality and amount of bass this subwoofer would produce with its lower wattage rating and entry level pricing so I gave it a test drive at a local retailer and was impressed.  Went ahead and purchased one and have been loving it ever since.  Fills my family room with nice rich bass for movies and music.
5,I love this sub. I use it with my 5.1 surround sound system and it shakes the pictures off the walls! (I've never seen my sister jump as high as she did when she was watching Batman and the photo frame fell off the shelf behind her!) It's also fantastic for music -- really deepens the sound and gives it a much richer feel.
5,I'm new to sound systems so I am learning as I go.  I bought this to replace a 20 year old unpowered sub.  This one is used in a 20x20 room or somewhere close to that and it shakes the floor and walls.
5,Very nice sound. Ten inch woofer and does the job with my surround sound
5,Enough for 25'x30'  family room even knobs were just half. Just arrived hookup straight to TV audio output and watch cable war movie the rest of the sound just came from wide screen stereo speaker for now super. Recommend this subwoofer. Still unboxing Yamaha receiver for audio. Fast delivery too.
4,Good quality it just didn't fit my system requirements.
5,This subwoofer was one of my best purchases EVER!!.  For it's price and bass response its a win/win that you just shouldn't miss out on.
5,With the sony 550 it shakes the house.  Can be turned down to a small room level or increased for "shaking" the house
5,Works good for the $$$
5,Just replaced my infinity unit with this Polk.  Very satisfied and happy with the quality and performance.  No rattling and can be fine tuned to exactly where you want it to be.  I didn't expect much from a ~$100 SW...it'll definitely surprise you.
5,If you are looking of a great sub look no further. I use this thing every time I watch a movie or listening to music. This is a very well made product. I love how it sound. Recommend it to all.
5,What can I say. It brings the boom. Powered and loud. It will shake the house. Really took the pressure off my amp and it can just play the highs now.
4,good power could be cleaner sounds slitly distorted could not tune it out
5,Great sub for the price $89.00 shipped to my door.I am using it in my 2 car garage for music and it really adds nice bass to my stereo system. I was a little worried about it being under powered but that is not the case. As always polk speakers are well made and worth the money  Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer (Single Black)
5,Basically I Love it! Just what I needed for bass works perfect with my Bose speakers.
5,I love this thing. I just hooked it up to a dvd player and saw what it would sound like. It is great and shakes the floor.
5,Great product and does what it advertises. It fills my 20'x15' room with enough bass to support my surround sound. If you're an audiophile you won't need my review as you'll surely know far far more about quality but to my ear (and rump) this thing shakes rumbles and rocks as hard as I need it to at this price point.
5,Great and powerful subwoofer! 100 watts of blistering power!
5,Using it with powered soundbar . Great sound
5,This matches up extremely well with the Polk 5jr pair that I use in my home studio. I'm driving everything from a Nakamichi Receiver 3 and the crossover is very smooth.This would be fine in a small to medium size room and would be suitable for critical listening if you're willing to spend the time tuning it to the room.
5,I love the product. The only thing is the blue lights. Yeah LED lights are too bright
2,Was happy with the sub for our home theater until it suddenly stopped working after 18 months. Currently waiting on Polk Audio to address the problem through repair or replacement.
5,For being a low power sub it really fills the living room.
3,I was replacing a 12" Infinity sub which got a bad amp after 3 years. Got this at the amazon sale for $80. Besides the low price not much going for this. It doesn't pack that much punch and for regular TV shows you can hardly feel the base. I guess you get what you pay for!
5,Great value for you money. More than enough bass.
4,Love it very good product
5,What is it with subwoofers?  The two previous ones (Energy and Atlantic) both eventually started with the random booming noises - which folks seem to attribute to worn out capacitors.In any event ordered this one from Amazon at a great price plugged it in sounds great no more random booms.Convenient simple looks like the price is even better now.
4,not too large seems sturdy good value good sound.One thing to note is that this does not come with any cables (aside from a power chord) so be sure to buy one separately.
5,Goes perfectly with my Vanatoo speakers.  Simple cheap and does what it is intended to do.
5,Good sound great price.
5,Excellent sound quality and volume (I am not an audiophile I may not have the best hearing to tell the difference).  Worked excellently with the Yamaha receiver.  Only complaint is that there is two (L and R) RCA inputs and I didn't know how to proceed (my fault not the subs).
4,Sounds pretty great for the price
5,I have blown a few JBLs in the past. Figured I would try a Polk. So far so good. I liked it so much i have purchased two for two separate rooms.
5,Was concerned at first.  Using with a sound bar didn't have a good Y cable. So the volume wasn't very good on one channel.  Once I got the Y cable and subwoofer cable it works as promised.  Nice and well balanced bang for the buck!  Makes me want to get a better sound bar to match the great subwoofer.
4,Definitely works! A bit bulky but I'm the wife & can't quite understand the need for it. My husband seems to be happy with this purchase though.
5,I bought the Polk sub-woofer to replace a Boston Acoustics on which the volume control died making it useless and "possibly"repairable (if I send it to New Jersey). I figured the shipping charges would be more than the price of the new Polk.  The Polk for less than 1/2 the price is just as good or better. The cannon from the 1812 Overture appropriately rumbled my 20x26 foot room so I'm very satisfied.
5,Works great.  Needed to lower the volume because it was so intense!  I love how it automatically powers down when not in use.
5,It is a key component to my sound system. Excellent Bass response and impact.
4,It is great - But it was delivered W/ broken Grill Cover (that has not been replaced yet) OTHER WISE IT IS A " BEST BUY "
4,Good sub works well in my 15x15 room.
5,OMG I love this sub!!!  So so so happy I found and bought it.  It's so powerful.  I'd give it twenty stars if I could!  Great value great purchase not a single bad thing to say about it.
5,Love the strong bass sound. I wanted a 12" but price to expensive but today I looked at amozon on line and found the 12" is the same price now as the 10" I just purchased.
4,it's a great sub and all but it doesn't put of as much bass as expected
5,This speaker is awesome!!!
4,Great sound Earth Wind & Fire never sounded better
4,This was a great buy. I replace a very large double 12" system that my wife hated in theLiving room to this and it turned out great. Would recommend to my friends.
5,Nice Sub. My Second one and I love it.  At a moderate volume for listing to music you will not need more.
4,Sounds great! However the Bose sounded a bit better...
5,Simple install sounds amazing. I like the automatic power control which shuts the speaker down if no signal has been received for a while. Looks good as well.
5,It sounds great the price was right thanks....my room mates are gonna hate me for this little gem...
5,I'm new to music and subs but this is by far the best bang for your buck it's super powerful and easy to use as well as light enough to move around and great sound with an amazing price definitely going to be getting another one
5,This is what my system was missing. After years and years of not having a sub now I can hear what was missing. It works great with everything from music to movies. Just spend some time getting the gains and other settings set correctly and it will sound great.
5,The sound is consistent even after 4-5 months of constant use. Very reasonable price. Can't complain about this product one bit. Excellent and blends in great. You will need to view a different picture of the product however because it is not displayed accurately. The box is a dark cherrywood and the sub is covert by a black screen. Hope this helps.
5,This sub is great got it for $90 and it sits behind my computer chair about two feet and fills my medium size room but you can hear it in any room it vibrates the cans on my desk when its only a quarter of the way to half volume i love it a great bang for your buck sub(:
5,Works nice for the cost
4,Big thump for the money. Two of these will shake the pictures off the wall. They are all you need. Try the 12's if you dare.
5,I love this subwoofer for the price it is a great deal. I use it in my living room with surround sound and I love it.
5,Bought this sub on black Friday after reading positive reviews.For the 80 dollars I paid this sub is more than worth it.It shakes my glass door and windows with half volume set.NB. You have to buy a step down for 220v to 110v if your living in a country with voltage supply above 110vI recommend this sub.
5,Replace my old blown sub.  Sounds so much better than the old one.  Hits hard.
5,This sub pounds. We have a large living area so we could have used two but I didn’t want it to look like a concert stage with speakers everywhere.
5,This subwoofer has acute response to small changes in in bass output.  A wonderful product.
5,sound was perfect once adjusted to room size.
5,Needed a moderate subwoofer for apartment system...got it with this one.
5,Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He said that for the amount we paid for it it does a really good job.
5,This has been a great addition to my entertainment system. It gets plenty load low frequency is superb and sounds great. It has an auto detect setting so you don't have to switch it on or off to use. It also looks great.
4,Added this to an in wall and in ceiling speaker system that was in our new home. The unit sounds great and looks good. I am not an audiophile but it had really made watching movies much more enjoyable. Easy setup.
5,Completemente satisfecho con el funcionamiento de mi SUBWOOFER PSW10 es un poder de sonido con bajos profundos que hizo el upgrade que pretendia para mi Home Theater. Lo recomiendo amplimente.Completely satisfied with the performance of my SUBWOOFER PSW10 is a power of sound with deep bass that made the upgrade that pretended to my home theater. Amplimente recommend it.Saludos desde Venezuela..
5,Holds its own
5,Amazing sound at a great price!
5,Good quality and great sound.
5,Great undistorted sound adds that whole dimension to the room. Half power totally adequate for 25x25 room with lots of furniture and rugs.
4,It is Much bigger than I expected... I should have looked at the measurements prior to purchasing.... However it works perfectly and it is a Polk!
5,Insane growl for the money.  Will drive your neighbors insane.  Very loud.  Can't get it above half or I might lose a filling.
5,I've purchased 4 of these over the years and they are no kidding the best bang for the buck powered sub on the market.
5,Made a lot of difference in my home theater.  I was missing all the fine details of low pitch sound in movies.  Now I can hear the whoosh of the things that zip by in movies and base drums.  Feels awesome!
5,This is a great sounding Subwoofer. Easy to set up. And it really gives my stereo that extra boost to make movies awesome to watch!!!
4,Can be paired with wide assortment of speakers musically. Distorts when pushed in larger rooms.
5,Nice sound
5,Great bass quality product.
5,Nadamas que dura mucho tiempo para autoapagarse y tiene un sumbido mientras lo hace.
4,Good product
5,I was concerned about the low price compared to others not any more. Thumps in my 14x18 room. It also has all the fine tooning and outputs of higher end models.
2,Paired with an Onkyo surround sound receiver it had great sound and balance in an 11ft.x13ft room. However in 5 months of use with the unit on the auto power function the power amp overheated. Now it does not power up. Disappointed.
5,It was a gift but I previously owned one from Amazon 5 years ago
5,Loove this. I'm not a super  or even a little bit a sound system guru but I do know what sounds great.  It's a well known product name and I'm happy with my purchase
5,Best for the price.
5,This is a really nice subwoofer for the price.  Hooked to an entry-level Yamaha receiver this sub produces nice clear lows.  It's not a small component so make sure you have the room for it.  I would certainly recommend this for people on a budget.  With the cover on it's also a nice looking piece of equipment.
5,This is the best product that you can purchase at this price point.  It is absolutely incredible.  If anybody has a bad review then they must have it hooked up wrong.  You cannot beat it.
2,I guess I was expecting too much for what I paid.  The area that this was going to be installed is approx.18'x20'.  After installing it I soon realized it is not capable of producing the clean tight bass that I'm accustomed to.  I installed it and area about half the size to run off a PC as a sub and its OK for that purpose. If you are expecting this $89 sub to provide clean tight bass at higher dB levels to keep up with your main speakers look elsewhere.
5,Have used some time now no complaints. Reasonably priced flexible controls packs a solid bass punch looks good.
5,Awesome sound! Great price
5,Bass quality is awesome for the price! Bought it because I have extra Polk Audio shelf speakers and needed to set up my beach condo with decent sound. This little box has some serious power!
5,I was a little worried buying this one because my neighbors are real close and i'm always watching action movies but no problem very tunable it can intense enough to rattle the windows or tuned down to give those choppers and explosions the right amount of rumble that is crisp and clear sweet setup fast shipping great price.
5,Love this subwoofer! Transformed our sound system from "meh" to "wow!" I got it for a third of the list price so I couldn't be happier. But even at half (current) it would still be worth it.
4,great subwoofer.  has my house vibrating.  it has left/right audio ports and speaker wire slots and its own volume control. Still playing around with all the controls
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This thing really rocks the house meaning its loud and has punchy bass. The only thing I can't handle is the port chuffing which is really bad at high volumesIDk if you can hear it in the video but it just makes the speaker sound bad
5,Bought this thing for my mancave in my basement to complement my stereo. It sounds better than i had expected. Way better. I love Polk audio speakers and im now a fan of their subwoofers as well. My house rattles a little bit and im extremely pleased with the quality of this sub. Would recommend
5,Very happy. Took a bit to get the balance of sound I wanted. Hooked it up to a Yamaha sound bar that lacked the low end I wanted. But now I'm happy happy happy!
5,Want to rumble your room for $100 bucks? Then this is the sub. I know audiophiles will disagree because you can't hear tones..but who cares? For most of us who watch 1 movie a week and a couple of sports game it's perfect!Having said that if i bought a bigger house with a whole downstairs as a media room i would spend $500-600 to get more wattage.
4,this sub worth every penny
4,Sub does not have a Sub level input.  You must use L & R "Y" adapter to work.  Here is the one I bought "Mediabridge Ultra Series - CA Y Adapter - 1-Female to 2-Male for Digital..."
4,i like it a lot. not on the same level as my klipsch ksw 10 it is made well and has plenty of clean bass for me.
5,im pretty sure i like it as much as my neighbors hate it. So a lot. Great clean sound everything i was hoping for.
5,This is a very nice sub it looks great sounds great and fully adjustable. I have it in a fairly small room with my down firing 12" sub corner to corner its perfect
5,Outstanding for the price
5,Absolutely ridiculous! If your trying to add some deep quality bass to your setup you can’t beat it. Really happy
5,This sub pumps pure bass.  Shakes the walls and delivers where others do not.  Even at low volume it shines.
5,Good bass sound easy hookup
3,I can only give this on a reserved "okay."  It may be just a characteristic of digital sound that the bass thumps and booms.  If I do not turn the gain to a very low level the only sound I get sounds like those car sound systems where one only hears the thump of the bass when they drive by --  100 yards away!  I am not a happy camper.
5,Very nice
5,This subwoofer sounds great! I dealt with port noise for awhile but I don't seem to get that problem anymore.  Still not sure what caused it but I think it was my wires.  I've owned this sub for several years now and decided to change my review to 5 stars.  I would highly recommend for any sound system.
5,AWESOME SUB!  Replaced the Take Classic 5 Subwoofer and WOOOOOWWWW!!  What a difference!!!  Plus at $69.99 right now you can't beat it!!  This subwoofer usually retails for over $100!!100% happy.  Room filling tight bass.  Leaps and bounds better than the Take Classic 5 unit.  My satellite speakers can finally rejoice!!
5,This is the best value in subwoofers for your small-to-midsized home audio system bar none.
5,Hooked this up to my 52" visio sound bar love that you can tweak volume to match the level coming from the sound bar. Exactly what I needed just right!
5,Great for the price!
3,Decent sound quality for an apartment. Unfortunately it died after approximately 2 years of use. It still turns on but it doesn't recognize any input.
5,I bought this as an upgrade for my sound system I absolutely love it.  Read a couple of customer complaints about the low bass however it was great for my living room which is a pretty good size.  I love bass and I rarely turn it up past half.  I would not hesitate to purchase this if I were you!!  Great price great sound!
5,I bought the wrong size but bigger is better so I kept it. And I works great!!
5,Great sound.  Glad I waited for it to come down in price.  Was 80 jumped to 130 and bought it at 90.  Took 3 months for the price to drop but I have JVC sub already and  this wasn't a necessary purchase by any stretch.  Btw - much cleaner sound than my JVC.
5,Amazing for its size
5,Hands down this is the sub for the money. It packs a punch for being only ten inches. The first day I got it I "somewhat" annoyed my neighbors as this is just a beast! Just make sure you get the crossover set right on your receiver and set the low pass all the way up on the sub... will sound great!
4,5.1 Sony
5,Sounds great after a couple of months of break-in. No issues.Great price.
5,Great replacement for my blow Yamaha subswoofer it sounds better than the one that came with my Yamaha receiver.
5,Polk audio  always makes great products  and this one is no different. I'm using this subwoofer along with a PA system in my home studio and this woofer shakes the room.  This subwoofer is also very durable. I would highly recommend this product.
5,I have owned this unit for 5 years and going just like new Excellent Sub Woofer ordering a new one for my living room HT.
5,This is good little sub. I have been using it for several months now with no problems at all. It replaced a high dollar B&W sub that I was always having problems with (the amp burned out 3 times). Don't let the low price fool you it is a good little sub.
5,Fantastic great super sound just like being at a concert! Makes all the difference when hooked up with bookshelf speakers. Best speaker I have!
5,Awesome addition to surround sound.
5,Perfect replacement for my blown subwoofer. I was able to tune it in for my space within a couple of hours of studying the sound and a few tweaks.  Great value.
5,I love my talk audio subwoofer I still use it today can't complain I love this product thinking about buying another
5,Absolutely booming bass.  I don't even have the volume half way up and it shakes my living room. Goes great with my 5.1 setup.
5,Sounds good not too punchy or boomy.  Once you get the settings right it performs well.  Very easy to connect to a receiver.
3,The little legs are so cheap. This sub sounds great crazy how cheap the legs are!  I will buy my own and fix it. Just pissed
5,It's neither cheap nor expensive but very good quality and just what I needed.
4,Good sub wooferjust remember it is not shielded. Cannot set close to speakers tv etc. It is large. Pay attention to the measurements or it will not fit.
4,Like the sub but the design is a little faulty.  When it gets cranking the sub rattled against the cover.  If you remove the cover the rattle goes away.
5,Using this sub with two Bose desktop speakers. Whst can I say? This thing is AWESOME!!
5,This sub sounds great. Fantastic low end with solid bass. I would buy again and recommend to friends.
5,Sounds great looks great well made. It is a bargain at this price. Would definitely purchase again!
5,Absolutely UNBELIEVABLE quality sound solid / precise build and shakes my house to the core!!!  For HOW MUCH AGAIN!  Crazy awesome price.  There really is nothing else to be said.
4,There is some distortion at higher bass levels but a good sub for medium and low volume bass playback with good fidelity at those levels
5,Good sound for the price.
5,Reasonable and good
5,Yes only 50 Watts but powerful with room to spare. The gain is only at 50% and still plenty of boom.
5,Good bass good price..nuff said..
5,This is awesome. If you are looking for a powered sub and don't want to spend much this is it. If not the same quality as the big brands. 5 stars
4,I love the sound of it for the price... A bit big in design but perfect sound.. wish only it was smaller.
5,Worth the money great sound. I was skeptical at first but figured I would ship it back if it didn't work out. I have a high end sound system and this compliments it very well.
2,I guess mine is a lemon and will have to return it.I've been looking for a nice sub to pair with my Energy Take Classic 5. After some research I picked the PSW10. It is very nice that when New.egg sale it for 79.99 Amazon immediately adjusted its price too. I have to say that I'm a big fan of amazon.Back to the sub. After receiving it I set it up with my Onkyo receiver. The bass sound is awful. When volume is low the sound is not quite persistent. When volume is adjusted to produce persistent low frequency sound it sounds muddy and not deep at all. Even the subwoofer came with the HTiB system sounds million times better than this one. I'm giving it 2 stars because of the price and the look of the product.
5,Great sound loving it. Will buy another.
5,Im not sure how this product has any reviews less than 5 stars. I upgraded my surround sound sub with this and am very impressed. I mean 35hz-200hz frequency range for a $99 sub... You cant ask for a lot more. You cant compare this to their $300+ lines of subs but thats not what its meant to compete with. Highly recommended.
5,Very nice and powerful sound! It really makes a different in my home stereo sistem and now I'm enjoying it!One thing that disturbs me a little bit is I have to buy a transverter to change the voltage from 220 to 110V since I am in China!
5,I bought this baby in April 2013 and its well worth it for being a 10 inch sub this baby does its job well it isn't bringing down the walls or anything but its enough bass if your looking for an inexpensive addition to your sound setup. I cant imagine watching movies without it. Polk Audio is great!
4,Works well with my inexpensive system.
5,For price you can't beat it
5,It sounds great setup was easy and it's much higher quality than the price would suggest. Absolutely recommend.
5,It's amazing compared to the old Sony I had - literally shakes the floor. WHo doesn't like that? however at times it's a little muddy.
4,This subwoofer gives much just enough for my Samsung TV and Sony receiver system.
5,Excellent productEasy install
4,Decent sub for the price. Deep bass at louder levels doesn't so much rumble but rather rattles. Still it fills in the low end of a surround sound system on a budget.
5,goes well with my 7.1 receiver.....can blast movies and no distortion
5,I previously owned an Accoustic Research 8" down-firing sub that didn't have auto-sensing power feature.  The power switch was hard to reach and the bass lacked clarity and punch.  The front-firing Polk PSW10 was easy to setup and adjust and delivers superb sound....much deeper and clearer than the AR 8".  And it looks great....I highly recommend this sub for enhancing the audio on HDTV.
5,Incredible what you get for $99! Even comes with good looking front. Has all the inputs and controls you'd want including auto-power on/off. All in all worth every penny.
5,It's sound is exactly what you's expect from a Polk product. Perfect.
5,The things can pump out some bass. I got this with a center and two bookshelf speakers and this will be the only one that won't need to be replaced in a few years when I can upgrade my system.
5,Superb sound quality straight out of the box. I would recommend using this in larger rooms. it really packs a nice punch that might over power a smaller room.
5,Great product for the price!
5,A formal DJ the sub has a perfect sound you can get from any good woofer
4,I really enjoy this sub!  It has great low end!
5,Bang for your buck
5,Plenty of sound for an open concept living room. Positioned perpendicular to seating on a hard wood floor does not have that cheap "boom" sound  - more of a nice tight rolling bass note to fill the sound register
5,If you own a flatscreen TV and listening on the tinny speakers you're missing out. I bought a soundbar and this sub woofer and it makes all the difference in the world. Movies music sound so much better now. Easy to hook up great sound. I'm very happy with this product
5,Awesome sound makes everything better. Dose take a little messing around on the settings to get movie sounds correct.
5,This is a fantastic subwoofer! I hooked it up and haven't stopped smiling. My wife is worried our neighbors my complain and we are in a house.
5,works great and sounds great! i only have a two channel sony stereo so i'm running the line feed from the tape output on the stereo instead of from a sub/out connection. still sounds great and i just set the volume on the unit to about 10%. thunderous boom with movies!
5,Sounds great for the price.
5,This subwoofer is an excellent product don't be fooled by the low price you can pay 3 times as much and you'll not notice any difference in sound!!
5,Great unit. My fault had to return . New Tv and no way to plug it it even to pair with amp.
5,Bought a new AV receiver and it only had pre-amp out for the subwoofer unlike my previous AV which had a 100 watt internal amp for its subwoofer.  This one is great!  Hookup was simple using RCA connector cables and plugging into an AC outlet.  Instructions outlined proper setup and it sounds great with the new receiver!
5,This subwoofer is so good i would recommend it to anyone in the world.
5,I was a little unsure of this product at first then when I hooked it up I could not be any more happy with it. It sounds great there is little to no distortion within the bass. I will recommend this to anyone who likes to feel like they are in a movie or likes to be at a club.
5,Works well with my other Polk  speakers.
5,Has great bass.  Sounds great.  One thing that wasnt covered in the manual was it will power down after 15 minutes of stereo turned off.
5,I had another popular brand 10 inch with 5 times the power. This subwoofer is just as powerful sounding. My old subwoofer was like a low drum one note. This subwoofer has that note and all the notes of a tuba and trombone. Music is beautifull with the psw10. Absolutely flawless subwoofer.
5,Love my subwoofer!
4,Good productworth for your money.
5,Great subwoofer for the price.
5,For the money (Under $100 on sale) it is a great buy watch for this to go on sale and don't hesitate to pick it up.  Keep in mind this isn't going to provide ear drum shattering lows but it is a very nice compliment to any entry-level home theater system.
5,Im going ti say this is a pretty good package Polk Audio PSW10 good entry level and great sounding.  You wont be disappointed
5,Great sub woofer. Clean crisp base. Have is outside in a covered pool cabana. It's paired with Yamaha out door speakers and powered by a sonos connect AMP. Sounds awesome.
5,Own 2 of them now and they work well for the money.
5,Purchased due to the loss of my original sub for my home theater system. Glad I did. This subwoofer is much better than the one i had bought from Sony. Highly impressed
5,Value for money!
4,For the price it works..
5,It works great was surprised at the power it has rocks the basement theatre
5,I bought this to enhance the sound of my games.  When I blow something up I want it to sound good.  It brings a nice BOOM.  Need to make sure you have a sub output on your PC though.
4,Excellent sound at a reasonable price!
5,Added this to my Onkyo Flagship reciever and it THUMPS!!! Great sound quality and bass production.
5,Polk has a good name in audio for good reason.  I've paired this subwoofer with my new Presonus Ceres 4.5 Bluetooth speakers.  The system sounds great together!
4,Sounds great.
5,Bought this to use with a yamaha receiver. Yamaha uses a single(1) rca wire for subwoofer control so I used a 'Y' splitter to run the correct standard red/white to this sub. So If that's what you're planning; it does work and works well. I had to turn the bass way down it was shaking things. Good value here.
2,So far not impressed. An audible hum coming from the sub even when the head unit is off. Disconnect the RCA inputs and it clears up. I can turn the volume down on the sub and the hum goes away but then there is no base from the sub. I'm calling a bad amp. I will try another set of rca cables but the ones I am using now are brand new so I am doubting if there is an issue with those.
5,I'm bumpin hell yeah
4,Excellent product
5,You can’t go wrong with this sub. It will have your house rocking. I just had to buy one more.
4,Great sub for the price.
5,Just amazing. Bought this four years ago and it's going strong. I'm afraid to turn it all the way up because it gets so loud and powerful. If you need a sub you can't do better than this one
5,These subs deliver do not pass them up really happy with the sound and look.
1,Absolute trash
5,I have 3 of these and love them for the simple basic use.
5,I have it in the living room and as many said even on half gain it has plenty of thump.  And when listening to music or music dvd etc. it rocks the living room.For some that said it sounded a little "boomy/echo" I would suggest turning down the freq. so it is more on the low end thump and not the higher freq.
5,Great sound for the price plenty loud enough for my livingroom
5,I like it.
5,Love it. Great adjustable features. Very good bass sound with music and movies/HD tv. I have hooked it up to the sub out and only used the L RCA connection.
5,Lots of boom for you buck with this sub. Looks good seem swell made sound is excellent in an average sized room. I've had to tweak the settings on my audio unit quite a bit because some of the really deep lows in games and movies with rattle the pictures off my walls. It's terrific.
4,Great sub woofer for the price
4,It is ok thought it would be a bit better for the money I am happy
5,sounds great .
5,This thing rattled the house and I live in a solid brick house even interior walls are brick
5,nice sub  i have owned much more expensive ones but this seems to do a very nice job in my home theater
5,Works great with a long battery life and quick re-charge
5,Great product for a great price from a great brand. Completely happy with the sound of this sub. Plenty enough bass to fill a room of any size.
4,it was what I expected very please
5,Replace a lower-end SONY I bought in 2004.  I couldn't be happier.  Great price and fully complements my surround speakers.  Would definitely buy this Polk Subwoofer again
5,This puts out a lot of base for the price. I was quite surprised.
5,I like
5,Well worth the $$$for my speakers just a little Sub took my Listening into Audiophile territory!I always longed for a more punchy & realistic bass!Bought a better amp & pre-amp a blue-ray &finally this little Gem!For the young & bass heads!! buy the bigger onesfor support this does it!
3,OK sub for the money.  It does routinely get overwhelmed with loud explosive scenes in my theater setup.  I have it turned down just wish I could crank it.  It does hit fairly hard especially considering the money spent.  I would rate it as an entry level subwoofer.
5,This inexpensive subwoofer has added a whole dimension to my sound system for both classical music and movies. The added bass frequencies sound natural with little if any boominess  Highly recommended
5,the first one was bad out of the box but amazon was very fast to replace it. I am very happy with this unit. It performs very well and exceeds my expectations
5,Cannot believe how good this product is for the money!  You can't go wrong if you're looking for quality base on a tight budget.
2,Good for moviesThis subwoofer is mainly for BOOM BOOM BOOM SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE.It gives good effects on action movies and suchBut if you are looking for controlled fine tight quality bass LOOK AWAY!I give 2 stars for the price and built quality.It is quite big as wellSo beware if you are looking for something small.Q) Would I recommend this to others?A) NO!I'd really like to return this but I brought this to Guatemala and will probably cost more to return lol I will have to use it for a while.Also there is this annoying rattling sound when it reaches certain level of frequency.There is couple of other reviews mentioning this problem it could be a defect.May be I was expecting too much from high ratings~I will definitely buy another subwoofer when I have chance and throw this away.
4,good product for the money provides a thump when you need it...lookout for wildly fluctuating price points on this 79.99 one day119.99 the next..I didn`t think this was a commodity but it fluctuates wildly and still a great buy
5,sound is very good great subwoofer it really deserves all it's positive reviews.
5,Great value.
5,Very powerful woofer. It fills my 24' X 36' room with booming bass. I actually have to turn the volume down on this to about 10%.
5,But it
5,Much better than the previous subwoofer I had in my home theater setup. No more extremely boomy bass. Great for the price.
3,Functionality and sound are great. However the subwoofer produces a loud popping sound every time the external satelite speakers are turned on. It's so loud that I got scared the first time I heard it....For now I just never turn off the satelite speakers...
5,Can't hook it up to my sound Bar
5,Perfect sub woofer for medium size room excellent price value.
5,By passed a bose acoustimas and the sound is great!  I got more kick out of the small bose speaker than ever.  Took the output of the Acoustimas and hooked the speakers straight into my Onkyo receiver.  I own an Onkyo TX-SR606.  The sound I am getting out of the PSw10 is amazing!  A++++
5,Great for the price!! I have five in my movie room.. they work just fine.
5,Excellent adds good solid bass to my small setup.For $100.00 bucks I couldn't be happier! This thing "ROCK'S"
4,For a powered 10 it packs a nice punch and very clear turned on some Pink Floyd Dark side of the Moon and yeah I was pleased.
5,This subwoofer has tons of power if your in the room you will feel the bass! Perfect for theater setups of any kind that need better bass. This subwoofer is very affordable and packs a big punch. Definitely would buy again if I needed to.
5,Works great
5,Quick delivery. Bought two of these for our theatre room and they work great! Even though they are compact (what we wanted) the sound is fantastic. Feels like we are at the movies. Definitely recommend!
5,Nice subwoofer
5,Love this sub!  My wife hates it!!!! Five stars for sure;)
4,Sounds great but you have to put it quite far away from you to isolate the port noise
5,Was on sale at a ridiculous price and it was worth it replaced an old Boston Acoustics model that lasted me 15+ years.  Does not have the feedback loop problem the Boston did and while it is unshielded (versus what the product details said) its not a problem as I have it nowhere near any other gear.
5,Inexpensive small and best of all my neighbors hate it!I am not an audio electronics expert. This plugs into the new receiver I purchased. Had the connections I needed and was self explanatory with volume settings. No complaints enhanced my current set of 5 speakers a lot! No surround sound should be without a sub.
5,the cost and the output of the sub were ideal....I bought 2!
5,Works well.
5,Would buy this again and would 100% recommend!!  Best speaker for the money and a "little" giant!!!
5,I bought two to make a 7.2 av system. They sound great! Great lows !
5,This little 10 in subwoofer gives off some bass...
5,This thing rocks.
5,love the bass very good in sound power of the bass.
5,Impressed.  That's all I can really say to sum up this $100 wonder.  It blows away other Yamaha/Sony subs I've used in the past in this price range.  I use this one primarily for music but I'm going to get another one to replace our home theatre sub.  Great all around sub!
4,This is a wonderful sounding subwoofer.It really fills the room and I think has a lot of bang for the buck!
4,Added this as my second sub for my system. Only negative I have is it rattles. I will take off the front cover when I play music loud. Then it stops.
3,Entry level woofers trying to sell them and update with Klipsch
5,This product sounds great and makes a very large entrance when turned on.
5,Works great for me as an addition to a 15" powered sub I already have. It helps fill in between the 6" drivers of the tower speakers and the 15" sub.
5,Years ago I started with a "package" surround system. Purchased a new amp and needed a subwoofer. Read the reviews from other purchasers and am pleased with the sound and response of speaker.
2,It sounded really good at first but now its got a weird vibration sound when it plays. Would not recommend.
5,I bought this to hear more base with my PC speakers.  This subwoofer gives excellent sound and terrific base and is very reasonably priced.  To test it I listened to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture with the Cannons Booming . When they Boomed you want to jump out of your seat  :).
4,I really like the sound but I did have to search for cables to connect it.
5,Performs very well as an add-on to my speakers in the media room. Plenty of power (room is 20' x 22') to vibrate the floors. Provides that much needed bass especially for action movies.
5,Ready adds some good bass to my system
4,I Like this product
5,I'm really happy with this sub.
5,Nice subwoofer. Excellent bass responce. Goes well with the Polk T50 tower speakers. Nice sound and not a budget breaker.
4,Great deals can be had on this basic sub.  The sound quality is better than similarly priced options and lack of inputs is the only thing keeping from five stars.
5,Great sound if you need less expensive theater sound. Affordable price and worth the sound of the speaker produced.☺️
4,The port could be a little smaller in diameter . . . With some tracks it distorts real fast and doesn't follow Metallica or Iron Maiden quite well at times
5,I added this subwoofer for more sound quality and boy does it deliver I am very happy with the sounds and feel for movies but for music wow I really did not know what I was missing I would recommend this to anyone and let me just say the juice is worth the squeeze.
5,Been using this for quite a while now and I have to say it has great sound adjustable crossover and volume control as well.  Music sounds great movies sound great and I can't rave about this enough.  I even got my best friend to buy one as well and they love their too.
5,I replaced a sub I had for a long time that cost me 5 times more than this one.  This sounds just as good and it looks very nice.  I am very impressed and for the price it is a great investment.
5,Took a few days to break in but sound great now.
5,This sub is really nice.  Looks good and sounds good.  Have it connected to my TV speakers wirelessly.
5,i now have two of these subs and i love them. they produce the cleanest base ive ever heard. you can really up the gain and get hard hits but for gaming and music you only need them on half power. playing call of duty and watching action movies with this sub is amazing. super simple to set up also.
5,Awesome sound.  It replaced a busted 12 inch sub woofer and at about 1/3 the price.
2,Connections were simple.  Bass output using the SONOS amp was pretty good.  You have to be fairly close to it (within 18-20 feet) to feel a difference.  But mine was plagued with an audible 'hummm' noise every once in a while.  Tried adjusting the dials in the back but they did nothing.  This humm would come and go as it pleased.  Got very annoying very quickly.  Additionally I noticed within minutes of turning it on (no music coming through) I started getting a pounding headache that would last the entire day.  This had never happened to me before and doesn't happen when listening to other subwoofers (e.g. home theater systems).  So between the headaches the humm and the lack of output for bigger spaces I decided to return it.
3,I had a Klipsch subwoofer that had a amp card go out on it. I used this as a replacement but used the Klipsch subwoofer and the legs that came off of it to increase the aesthetics of the unit. It truly rocks now and although my Klipschwas a bottom firing unit the legs are very stable and got the Polk sub off the ground and really increased its performance.
5,I love it.. neighbors do not.  :-)Best money I ever spent on a sub.  Why I spent $1K on an M&K THX certified sub-woofer years ago.. I have no idea.  Maybe because this wasn't available at the time.  :-)
5,had it over a year already and it still slaps HARD .. shakes my apartment and my neighborspretty impressive
5,All I can say is Boom Rumble deep bass what a sub is supposed to be! For 100 bucks you can't beat it. Well made and great quality
5,I have 2 of these and I live in an apt let’s just say I’m surprised I haven’t gotten evicted for noise disturbance
5,This sub offers just the right amount of bass for a small to medium living area.  Apartment style.The bass is not overwhelming or earth shaking... But to my ears it is very musical once the right crossover points are set in your system.
5,happy with my purchase great item at a great price nice deep bass
5,I am very very pleased happy content with this sub I replaced my klipsch sub that was starting to have issues with this one and it by far meets my needs. Very great sub for the price. Not nocking klipsch at all because all my other speakers are klipsch.
5,Ive owned a few subwoofers in the past. This psw10 is definitely is great for the cost. It pushes out the lows nicely. The nobs and switches on the back are easy to read and understand. Set up was simple
5,I have paid twice the price for another speaker that doesn't compare to this one.  For everyday T.V./DVD/CD playing this speaker is tops.  Well worth the price.
5,For $100 I wasn't expecting much but this thing knocks.  I have it on about 25% gain and it's plenty of bass for my in-ceiling speakers.
4,Very nice for the price nice solid box  will buy again
4,I'm basically happy with Polk audio speakers.  Subwoofer functions very well.
5,Duuuuyyyaam!
4,I feel it is a great Sub for the price!  Put's out nice base and complements the other speakers that I already have.  This is replacing an Infinity PS300 that burned up years ago.
5,This subwoofer put out some serious bass and increased my sound system tenfold. For the price and for the sound I couldn't be happier with this purchase. It makes such a difference I can't imagine watching movies without it!
5,My friends all say they want one and then I told them I spent like 80 dollars on it. It makes ur surround sound so much better. Especially video games. I dont see why you would want anything bigger I use it halfway and its perfect for my living riving. Although I dont live in a castle.
5,I blast this woofer on full blast for 3 hours every day and had for a year great sound I believe it's Rms power is definitely under rated
5,WOW big BANG for you're buck. Great sound at a great price what more could I ask for. Love it twice the sound I got from my 8" Polk. Huge upgrade.
4,The Polk PSW10-10 subwoofer was a replacement for a much higher priced one that recently quit working in my surround system.  So far this item has more than surpassed my expectations and saved me $250.00.
5,Great speaker I have the 12" in my theater! I would buy again!
5,Great on my Yamaha HRX-V385 5.1-Channel 4K Ultra HD AV Receiver. Have to turn the bass down.
5,Powerful sound and enough controls/connectors in the back.
5,More than enough bass for my condo more compact than most subwoofers yet pumps out tons of bass.
5,Bought for my husband as a replacement for the one he had great price shipping no issues. pleased with this purchase
4,No LFE input and not an exceptionally deep bass but good value and helps complete a small value surround sound system. Won't break your windows.
5,Great subwoofer
5,My first sub. It adds depth and power to my system and I haven't noticed any sloppiness in the sound.
5,en vez de echar tanto verbo simplemente dire que hace PUM PUM bien a toda madre
5,Hooked up to a 2.0 tube amp. Great for adding bass to a small bedroom system
5,Excellent quality in an unbeatable price. Very simple to install. Good instructions.
5,Upgraded my older 8 inch Polk sub that recently died.  Easy to set up.  Bought an insignia sub for my Ilive speaker bar and for around the same price the Polk psw10 blows it away.  Only bought the insignia brand as it was an open box item for $35 and it originally goes for $89
5,Has A great sound for the size and price! The room I have it in is about 15'x12'x10'. Purchased 11/2013.--Update 12/2017--She is still pumping away! And still has a great kick!--Update 06/2018--She is still pumping away! And still has a great kick!
5,Awesome Speaker
5,Now I just wish I didn't live in an apartment so I could turn it up a little louder.
4,It's a little rumbly even at low volumes but for the money it's exactly what I expected. I just wanted to add a little punch to a sound bar on a TV and it fit the bill.
5,I now have 3 of these PSW's in my home. Great product....Great value!
5,It was a little larger than expected
5,It does a great job on my surround sound system
5,Good bang for a few bucks -  produces a fairly tight and clean bass that greatly improves music with my small satellite speakers.
5,Impressive sub!! For less than $100 delivered!! Has nice controls and I love the options for connecting to reciever! Clear deep bass that doesn't distort!!
5,sound perfect
5,Easy hook-up.  Really brings movies to life!  Also love the fact that it only turns itself on when it detects a signal being sent to it and then turns itself off after receiving the signal.
4,For the price and size of the subwoofer can't go wrong. Very compact can be tuck away behind sofa or stand. Only negative build quality looks cheap for a polk. Beside that all good..
5,Purchased this Sub on recomendations I read when purchasing the Onkyo system. I am very pleased with the lows. I can easily distinguish the bass guitar parts to tab and practice.IF you are a bass player this is a must have for your practice room... couple with the Onyko and you won't be disapointed!
3,this sub woofer is not that great but for 130 bucks it will do its only 50 watts rms so dont get confused with the 100 watts of power that's the subs peak wattage. I played Transformers and my sub couldn't keep up with my Klipsch Synergy Speakers the sound was very distorted when LFE came into play. In addition i don't blast my receiver i keep the volume around 45 and its max is 75.  Put your all into a sub so you can get want you really want out of it.
2,As others have noted this sub is good for budget minded people that don’t go past 50% on the volume. It distorts heavily as you get louder and doesn’t give low booming bass sounds as expected. My 8” entry level Onkyo subwoofer is outperforming this 10” and I’m very disappointed after reading so many 5 star reviews. I’ll be returning it.
4,This is subwoofer is average at best. If your room is oversized stay away. It is definitely a decent sound but lacks volume when you need it most.
3,Ok subs. Don't really hit the low ends well. Anything lower than 35 or maybe 40 hz is no good. They do well on music but for home theater I'd spend a little more for the low end.
5,For under one hundred bills I doubt you could find a better sub than this.  I have a pretty big living room and this sub more than adequately fills the room whether its for movies or music.  I have had this for over six months so far and it has been awesome.
5,Placed this sub in a smaller room with the Energy Take Classic 5 theater speaker set driven with an excellent Onkyo Receiver.  This 10" sub absolutely set off the whole system.  Couldn't be happier with the purchase. If you are on a budget and have a small space this sub is worth the money.
5,I looked high and low reading review after review and finally decided to purchased this unit.  I have absolutely no regrets.  This thing shakes my house if I want it too!  Just lovely...Works well for music as well as home theater.  Very good bang for the buck.
5,Great base sound very rich
5,Good for the money. still can understand all the switches on the back. A bit larger than I thought it was going to be but well made and good sound. watch the measurements of the cabinet easy to hook up  even tho i don't understand audio  hooked to a Sonly receiver.
5,Polk just knows how to do it!  I use this sub to augment an addition sub (12") in my media room.  This sub blows the 12" away!!!!  You really don't need two unless you feel the need to shake the roof of your place though.  Love it love it love it!!!
4,I can't imagine anyone spending more for a subwoofer. Works great. Recommended.
5,Very please with my purchase. Sound quality is just as good as $300 competitors.
5,Excellent speaker for the price. 2nd one  bought in 15 years the 1st is still working in my media room.
5,AWESOME: this thing shook the f#$k out of my house LOVE ITexactly what i needed and then some a whole lot more
5,Plenty of bass! Replaced my LG sub with this Polk and it really livened up my surround sound. Great product from a top notch brand at a killer price!
5,Sound guy said they have a nice sound
5,nice deep rich rumbling bass. Great for watching movies.  It's not wifi.  I have mine hooked to my Yamaha 107 sound bar.
5,How did I ever live without this Polk Audio subwoofer before? It was the dark ages. Fantastic product - I waited way too long to purchase!
4,Very good woofer for the price!
5,Works awesome!
5,For the price this thing is hard to beat. I would purchase again if I ever needed one.
5,The PSW 10 is an exceptional buy for the money and performs above my expectations.  However it did come with the 2 (left & right) female ports and as I was coming from my receiver with a multi-plex cable caused a bit of concern.  But after an email to Customer Service my concern was resolved.
5,I have this going through a Vizo sound bar and it hits HARD. So glad I bought this sub.Looks great with out without the cover on as well.
5,Perfect sound
5,Great sound quality just make sure to buy a Y splitter for cable connection to sub do you get full dynamic sound . Subwoofer capable of very low frequencies rattles pictures across the house if I'm blasting it great for the money 💵
5,Nice solid bass auto power on/off works correctly.  Good looking sub good value for the money.
4,This sub shakes my entire room! Rattles my windows and doors with ease. It can sound muffled if not set correctly. Currently using it with an Onkyo sr313 receiver and Bose ceiling speakers. Music sounds great yet to try movies.
5,Serious BASS comes out of this box. Extremely pleased with it.
5,Sent this to my brother as a gift and he loves it. And you cant beat the price!
5,I have had it like 2 years and love it still
5,All the reviews were correct: this is well worth the $$!!
5,Liked it!
5,The sounds is absolutely incredible! I could not believe how good it sounds. I'm using this with my Vizio 2.0 soundbar. I'm no audio expert but for movies games and music this sub is brilliant especially for the price.
5,Good item
4,After watching the new Harry Potter movie  last night the subwoofer reminded me of how much I've been missing.  The bass really enhanced the viewing experience.  It's an excellent speaker especially considering the low price.  As usual Amazon shipped the item promptly and had the right price.
5,I mean it's not going to knock your walls down but this is an amazing sub especially for the money. It gets low and more than loud enough for its duties as my PC gaming sub. Paired with a decent set of bookshelf speakers you great a great sound at a great price.
4,Does the job and price was good at the time
5,N/A
5,Great bass in a small package. It brings my surround sound to life in my home theater. Will probably buy a second one just to add more thump.
5,Buy this one I did and it works great.
5,I had an older Polk Audio subwoofer that went to heaven so I needed a new one.  I looked around and found many for a $250 range but then came across this one for under $100 and after reviewing the specs it was perfect.  It arrived quickly and I installed it and it is great.  Great quality at a great value.
5,Nice!
5,This is a great subwoofer with all the bass I'd ever need. It's a bargain at $99 and it's the second one I've bought. It looks good and has clean deep bass.
5,Had to return it because I fixed my current Subwoofer but the company rocks and had no customer service issues. Highly recommend.
5,This is a great subwoofer.  Just plug it in and start feeling the bass.  I bought the Polk Audio TSi300 5.0 Home Theater Speaker Package seperately before hand so this was a perfect add on.  I just wish I woud have bought them all together.
5,Sounds great. Still works after several years
1,The subwoofer turns itself off after a period of inactivity the green light at the back turns red. Might go back not sure if it's a problem with this unit or if this is the general case. BTW it's paired to the sub OUT port on the Edifier 1850db.
5,After reading the reviews of this sub I decided to try it with my very basic home theater setup ( attached to a Yamaha sound bar YAS 101) and it was a great addition. It looks great has more than enough power to produce bass for a 450 sq ft room and above all its cheap.
5,Don't let the wattage discourage your interest in this item because it's design allows it to deliver plenty of punch !  Good product !
5,Works great. Used with surround system including record player
3,I've only had it for a day and while setting that up to those little plastic legs fell off in pieces good sound that I'll let you know more in a couple months
5,Best subwoofer for the money. But sounds great on its own merits. Highly recommended.
5,Exceeded my expectations. I use it outdoors.
5,This thing has some serious power and sounds great. I'm not an audio professional but it sounds great it's easily adjustable and the price is fantastic.
5,I purchased this sub to use with a pair of Cerwin Vega Sl5m 2 way bookshelf speakers I also purchased from Amazon and they made a perfect fit ! Not a huge system but gets the job done when I don't want to fire up the beast.
5,Really wort it and really cheap for a 10inch sub. It is awesome. I really recommend you this subwoofer. I use it with my Bose cinemate series II because I'm not really happy with that bass.. I add this one and now I'm happy with it. It is really worth it. I recommend this subwoofer
5,So far so good. This delivers just enough bass that I crave. Very good to have the deep tones in music tv and music once again. Tv speakers alone you don't experience the full experience you should be hearing.
5,Outstanding value and great direct speaker hookup if you don't have a subwoofer output on your amp.
5,dude this thing is badass I want to buy like 18 morethe bass is insane for the price a must buy
5,Good enough for a cheap sub.UPDATE. I have had this for almost 2 years now and I must say it is still going strong and sounding as good as day one. You cannot go wrong with this sub and price. Very very happy. Buying another one for my garage stereo.
5,Love it
5,Amazing value.. sounds pretty good but even more impressive for the price.
5,Can’t believe how great this sounds. Changed up my system completely. Powerful and punchy
5,Used it with my Bose and Pioneer receiver set
5,Sorry neighbors
5,I live in a small first floor apartment with neighbors on all sides.  I love this sub.  They hate it.  10/10 would annoy my neighbors again.
5,Took it out of the box and hooked it up.  Worked great.  Was watching Harry Potter in Blu-Ray and at one point though a thunderstorm was brewing here in SW Florida.  That realistic.Works great with Surround Bar by Polk.I am 69 and went through basic in the days before ear protection so the base notes sound much better to me than the treble.
5,I'm very impressed with this 10inch woofer.  I've been using a Bise Cinemate ii system. This sub blows it away. Using it with old Advent speakers all I can say is: WOW
5,Love this bass
5,This price is great with 50W speaker. Amazing plenty of bass for this medium sized area just put behind my Televison really easy to hook up.
5,Wooooooooo the sound Quality is unmatchable especially when I have 2 in the same room .... Look out yallDPSJ Ca
5,Really kicked up the sound from our home theatre system. I think it is easily one of the best values for a sub woofer.
3,The base enhancement is too subtle even on maximum power setting.Not worth it.  My main speakers are Polk's so I wanted to try.
5,Good crisp bass without the long low thundering you get from many.  In all this is a great buy.
5,Excellent for me
4,Sounds good. I bought it to boost speakers in my garage The base does a nice job filling the space.
5,So far this Sub has been working great sounds great too! I had a much more expensive Klipsh sub that died after 3 years. I was so pissed apparently it's a common problem with their subs. This sub was much cheaper sounds just as good with the listening levels I use. Great addition to any sound system.
2,I got no sound or moment coming it of the speaker.  I double checked my LFE connection crank maximum volume and open up the frequency.  Nothing.  Then I heard a loud noise while reconnect instead of just one LFE I did both LFE (sub out from my receiver).  I get very weak out put but sometimes boomy.  End up returning it for a BIC F12.
5,I actually purchased this to use and I am not a "professional" Amazon reviewer.This is all that needs to be said.WOW!Great bass!
5,Great speaker for the money. Unless you are in a huge room you don't need anything bigger.
4,Nice little sub. Good for music or watching TV. Not over powering on ether. Adds just the right amount of bass that my bookshelf speakers were lacking. Like the auto stand by also. And you can't beat the price!
5,Sounds wonderful
5,Great deal!!
5,Worth every penny. 2 years and still going strong
4,Good sub for money. Some middling but at this price no compliants
5,Sounds great!  I have it in my home office as part of my sound system hooked up to my record player.  Bass works great at least for me.  I'm not an audiophile but I think for the average Joe this subwoofer will suffice.
5,This little subwoofer sounds great. I would recommend it.
5,I love this extremely affordable subwoofer. The base is just right. Although heavy it is not large thus easy to place.  It was packaged very protectively and sent promptly. I would highly recommend this item and the seller.  Sure would not hesitate to purchase from them again. A+++++++  experience.
5,I have 2 and one is used outdoor. It is great for the price.
5,Great Sub!
5,I just installed all Polk Audio in wall speakers and even without a sub-woofer everything sounded really good. But I still ordered an inexpensive sub and since I liked the Polk Audio items I already had I went with a Polk sub...WOW! I am now in love with my home theater! This is a fantastic sub and an incredible deal!
5,The best!!
5,this is an excellent sub for the price good to be able to adjust the amount of bass it puts out attractive cabinet
5,This sub pack a punch! Used this in my 7.1 speaker surround sound setup and at half volume it shakes the floor and looks great!
5,Ought it as a gift for family. Set it up and nobody noticed until there was thunder on a show and they felt it
5,love it
5,Excellent for the price!
5,I am now able to hear my base when working on my music.
5,This is a real woofer meant for a real stereo system. It's not some cheesy "on line in" piece of junk. And for the price it's ****ing excellent. You'll need a stereo woofer cable that's in Y format or an adapter just fyi as there is no digital line in for the sound nor a standard "woofer in" plug.
5,The sub surprised me for the price it is quite good
5,Great sub!
5,Really strong sound.  I've bought this model for both of my homes and have paired them with pricy custom installed systems.  Very happy with the quality of these subwoofers
5,This is just what I needed and a good price. Delivers quality base sound without being overwhelming and has a nice appearance.
4,Good sound adds just enough bass to produce a full sound.
4,hard to beat for the quality and low price
5,I really like the sound it has to my Bose speakers.
5,Awesome sub paired with my Onkyo TX-NR 585!!!
5,Very satisfied with this unit. Easy to Hook up and operate. You will need a an RCA style cable to hook to your reciever. If your reciver has only one (1) subwoofer output also buy a RCA cable "Y" splitter. Really "booms" the room. Great!! Value.
5,I thought my Technics 15"s were "good enough". This fills out my low-end. A very good deal.
4,Great sound addition for me. Adjustable bass is great.
4,Although I've have not used it a whole lot it sounds great. The room that it is in is too small for the size got the controls turned way down.  Great product service awesome. Would purchase again.
5,It adds some nice lows to my surround
5,Big bang for your dollar. A little more than I needed for Tv-gaming system but #WOW loving bass.
5,Just short and sweet review......... as you can see (READ) 4 and 5 stars favor! Awesome sound! BUY IT!
5,Just got a pair of these Subs about a month ago to complete my 7.2 ch system. Man let me tell you something. I can't believe the sound these two subs can produce it's tight and clean no distortion. I'm quite impressed.If your looking for a great sub for under a hundred bucks. THEN BUY THIS SUB.
5,This is a great little sub for the money.  I am using it with some in-wall speakers in our work-out room and it sounds great.  Good low-end response and very tight.
1,Ordered one and jacks DO NOT WORK Then ordered a replacement and it was Worse than the first one! The bass was blown and jacks did Not work either! DO NOT EVER ASK FOR A REPLACEMENT ON SOMETHING THATS BAD ! BUY SOMETHING ELSE  THEY WILL RIPP YOU OFF AND TRY AND CHARGE YOU ANYWAY ! NOT THE ONLY ONE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO CORRUPT
5,Works great...sounds great.  Very happy with this.  We used it to add punch to a wimpy shelf system.
5,Powerful bass
5,This is a great buy! I bought it in 2013 but it is still working perfectly! It adds such a amazing BOOM to our living room when watching movies or even regular TV I would buy this again!
5,PROMPT FLAWLESS DELIVERY!!  For my nephew's Home Theater System - Perfect addition & WELL PLEASED... Many Thanks!!
5,This thing really adds the base to any system. I have 2 of these in my 7.2 setup and you can really feel it in both movies and music. Wait till around Christmas time cause these always go on sale. Got my for $75 each so they were a steal.
5,Amazing
5,excellent subwoofer. Works better than the Polk subwoofer that I previously had for less than half the cost. Couldn't be more satisfied.
5,It was an excellent bargain quality sound wow.
5,Still going strong a year later and brought our great room surround sound to life!
5,Good  base adjustable volume very  good value!!
5,Muffled sound at higher volume levels. I returned mine.
5,Arrived on time easy set-up and sounds great. Amazed this item was so inexpensive especially for a name brand I can trust.
5,Sprayed the whole thing in Plasti-Dip and threw it under my deck to be heard not seen.Truly impressive sound for the price!  Have it slightly cornered in the foundation walls and it fills out the outdoor main channels PERFECTLY!
5,Love this speaker!! The whole room shakes!!
5,Very good price and extremely good sound quality! Easy set up also.thank you.
4,I am happy to buy this grate subwoofer.
5,this is the best subsoofer for the price.  high quality great sound seems like it should cost more than it does for the product quality you get
5,Great bazz and ground shakin bazz with good vibratin speaker
5,After playing with the settings on my receiver I finally got the deep base set perfectly!
2,I must have received a defective unit because my sub-woofer just did not perform. The low frequency was not there: no deep bass no boom no earth rattling shake and no LFE input. I even purchased a premium 6 inch RCA Female to 2-RCA Male Digital Coaxial Splitter Adapter from monoprice.com (highly recommend the website for cables) and the sub-woofer still did not perform. There is a small hiss coming from the speaker as well. Believe the negative reviews because they are true. Do yourself a big favor and purchase the excellent Polk Audio PSW505 12-Inch Powered Subwoofer instead. I already own one PSW505 subwoofer and it is amazing. I recently purchased another PSW505 to replace the defective PSW10. The PSW505 is a great value right now and it's only a little bit more. You definitely will not regret it.
5,This Sub was exactly what I needed to fill my living room with powerful bass sound.I am very satisfied with the performance and price.
3,I was pleased with the appearance but not the performance it just would not tune in well with with the Polk RTI A1 bookshelf speakers.
5,This thing unleashes great bass notes for the price. Super happy with the purchase and quality of the speaker. Shipping was quick and its a breeze to hook up.
5,There are other subs out in the market with some similarities. I personally used different subs like Sony (booh). The sound comparison is as a JBL sub which for the price there well lets just say I would not spend the extra money. I would recommend this product it's good bang for your buck!!!
5,I love this sub.  For the price I don't think you could beat it.  Take your time and play with the levels to get the best combo.  I ended up turning the sub to 75% volume and then adjusting the sub through my receiver.  Sounds great.
5,Was impressed with the sound. Probably one of the best on the market for the price.
5,Amazing sub for this price. Strong and clean bass.
5,Beautiful sound
5,Great sound and works greakt with my Onkyo amp which is matched to my polk speakers
5,Awesome. Great bass for 10"sub
5,Ordered because of cost only $99! But love it because of sound! Easy to set up Easy to place. I put in some country to feel the bass and wasn't disappointed. Also I can really tell how much better the other speakers in my system sound with this subwoofer connected. The case is of superior quality too.
5,Works great
5,Nice tight bass not boomy. Great price!
5,awesome sounding sub especially for the price of $90 shipped to Japan.  I did not like the speaker grill cloth color so I just changed it out with some fabric from Amazon.  Cant go wrong with it especially if you get it on sale.
5,I bought this back in 2009 to complement some TSI 500s and all are still holding up well. This sub is not going to overpower large rooms but it adds a nice depth to a sound system. The volume and high pass filter controls on the back are effective and easy to use.
5,This is exactly what I expected and wanted it to be.... If you are looking for chest thumping picture shaking bass that will make you jump then you wouldn't even be looking at a 10 inch sub but if you know what a little sub should do then this one is great....
5,You will never be diappointed with Polk speakers. The bass in this sub is tremendous 10 inches is plenty.  I only have the sub volume at half and is amazing. Mine sits on hardwood floors I cant imagine how much deeper the sound would be on a carpeted floor.
4,this is my 2nd sub from POLK -----outstanding
4,Basically purchased this on cost. Some audiophiles say its lacking this or that but for me it did exactly what it needs to do. Give my family room bass for TV music etc at a cheap price. Its got lots of features sounds great and looks good!
5,For the price the sound quality is phenomenal. You would think it cost me $2-300.As an audiophile I had my reservations about a $90 sub but it is a powerful unit with well-rounded sound.
5,Great product at an awesome price. My family felt like they were in the cinema. I built my own surround sound system with different makes and models and this was a great addition. I liked this product. It was exactly what I expected. The delivery exceeded my expectations and was in great shape.
4,When you first get this speaker please work it out for a week or two at decent volume.  once the woofer is loosened up the sound is incredible.  Dont let the initial sound turn you off.
5,Replaced a smaller sub in our family room. Sounds awesome with my old LS70s.
5,For the price this Sub kicks out the bass that can be felt. It is easy to connect to many pieces of audio equipment. When it's time to rock the walls I power it up. The power adjustments are handy for tuning in to the right amount of bass! I really enjoy it!
5,Worked just as advertised. Bass is controllable in low volume as well as high volume. Sound is great.
5,Don’t forget to buy a rca adapter split 2x1
5,Very easy to install and performs as described.
5,Love this sub!! Now running a 5.2.2 setup and this sub handles it flawlessly !!
5,Loved this
5,I'm not a kid so I don't need the thumping noise to impress girls or my peeps. Lots of dials and things to tune it to where you like it. It sounds good with a couple of bookshelf speakers.I think the pounding bass helps with bowel movements too.
5,This sub is amazing! People were telling me to go with more pricier ones but the reviews on this said otherwise so I took the chance. Glad I did. I have to keep the bass turned way down so that my neighbors are not disturbed but it will rattle the room.
5,This is a really nice subwoofer and it works well with my Yamaha receiver and Polk Audio speakers. Easy set up.
5,So powerful and so huge!  I really lucked in when I purchased this because it does the job.
5,The Sub woofer Works Great Fast ShippingA++ i Would Buy From You AgainAnd May God Bless
5,After reading all the other reviews I decided on this model. What a great deal - both in terms of price and sound quality. It puts out more than enough sound for any sized room. The sound is not boomy - it properly reproduces music bass lines as well as providing the oomph you need for watching movies.
5,Awesome quality. Don't sweat the price being low - It doesn't reflect quality! Super happy with this purchase.
5,hooked it up to my denon and the sound was amazing it was the last speaker I needed to complete my theater. Definitely recommend it.
5,More than enough woofer for my 25 x 20 LR. Had to turn down in fact.
5,If you are short on cash and want a sub that can play movies or music this should be at the top of your list.  5 star value and overall quite good kills similar priced Yamaha sub.  Remember this is about $100 and can compare to products 2-3x the price.
5,For the price you will not be disappointed.  This thing thumps and creates great sound.  We listen to all kinds of music (country rap heavy metal hip hop etc) and it all sounds awesome.
5,This is a great unit. It takes a bit of practice to get the settings right for your specific room read the instructions.Quite frankly I don't see how anyone could need something bigger than this unless  they intend to use it on a large venue or outdoors.I recommend it!
5,I have owned Polk floor standing speakers and still use a Polk center channel. They have always impressed me with their quality and sound. When I saw what Amazon was offering these speakers for I could not say no. The PSW10 was a replacement for my old (8+ years) Cerwin Vega 8" sub. The Polk outshines it in every way.
3,Different look than the box.
5,Perfect for my media room. Super powerful for the price. I’m buying two of them
5,Great sub for the price.  I didn't want to spend a lot.  This added a nice low frequency without a high cost.
5,I bought this speaker for my home theater system and i have to say I LOVE THIS THING. It provides powerful bass when you need it adn you can adjust it to fit your needs.
5,Good stuff.
5,The only complaint is it does not have a bass only input to match the amplifier. You have to use a wire from the right & left channel. Since the room is medium size there is more than enough bass.The sound is very good and clear not mushy.
5,Great little sub. This is for my first theater and it feels good to have something that looks and sounds great and didn't require a second mortgage.
5,Great item!
5,Looks great. Good bass sounds good.  To much bass for my condo! Have it running at 20% of its output.
5,okay I had a Yamaha sw 10 inch with 100 watt amp.  it lasted 2 years.  this sub sounds as good or even better and its 50w.s.  easy to hook up.  sounds great
5,i've connected the unit to my Vizio VSB200 sound bar and couldn't be happier!  i was unsure of the sound bars ability to push enough sound thru the sub but it does the job just fine and the two complement each other very well.  u can't go wrong with this unit.
5,Good product.
5,Bass is not clear at high volumes
5,Great sound and great input/output on the back to make for very easy setup!
4,works awesome with the 7.1 speaker system i made for my pc. only took off a star because it doesn't have a LFE channel which is odd. the directions however to explain how to essentially create one.
4,Really Like this sub but does not have an LFE input. Although I did know that going in but the price was right. Great little sub for the money.
5,You simply will not find a clear rich sub woofer to fill a large room like this for the money. I would buy again.
5,I threw this behind the wall to give that movie theater effect.  Works extremely well.  Be sure not to put it near a wall of an adjacent bedroom.....works a little too well.
5,This thing rocks!! Rattles the windows...lol
4,Just for fun here's the back so you know what the hook-ups are.
5,I recommend this subwoofergreat pricegreat sound
5,A good way to fill in the bottom when using bookshelf speakers on a second or third system.  Using this sub allows me to rock-out in the workshop using my Ipod an old amp and some six-inch bookshelf speakers.  If you only want background music you won't need this.
5,I initially bought one to replace an older sub in my front room. I liked it so much I bought another for a second system. I prefer a closed design as opposed to a ported one but size does matter. For the price this is a sweet deal.  Oh ya I like Polk Audio too.
5,Long time audiophile. Been through many sound systems.  This sub is absurdly great. Smooth deep super-clean bass. Pop jazz hip hop classical. It doesn't care.
5,The PSW10 is perfect for my apartment hook up was a snap after about I had found the sweet spot for its location a level. Thank you again Amazon.
5,Totally awesome. This was the perfect addition to my theater/game room. It is remarkably powerful and everything I wanted.
5,I have had this now for a little over a year and it is great. I listen to music at home about 4 times a week and this item has greatly enhanced my listening experience. I recommend it to anyone wanting a good sub to add to their system
5,Great sub  good price.
5,Amazing sub. Cost/preformance ratio is best you can get.
5,It does the trick and then some. Just as good as my expensive $400 sub. Highy recommended for the price.
5,Don't know how durable it isbut it looks good and sounds good.
5,Great sound.  Ran my rear surround amplifier to speaker level inputs of sub woofer then plugged rear surround speakers to speaker level outputs.  Great sound for very reasonable price.
5,FYI I have the 12" and the 10" and if you dont mind spending a little more the 12" has a much more full deep base for music or surround sound. The 10" is fine or even great for surround sound and movies.
5,This sub woofer is a power house!!! Sometime the neighbors complain. IT IS GREAT!! I have owned several sub woofers over the years but this small compact Polk Audio out performs them all. I do plan to purchase additional ones when my theater room is finished.
5,Good subwoofer for the money. Once you brake it in and tune it in propely. Definitely would recommend this sub. You will not find a better sub in this price range.
5,Puts out some serious bass. i only have it turned up 2/3 and it will rattle the house.
5,These guys put out some great bass.
4,Polk Audio PSW10 Monitor Subwoofer is a Great Speakerand addition to my Home Entertainment System it also Gives out GOOD High Base Sound and It allows You use it when you like with Rear turn off stand by SwicthSincerely David Earl Jones
5,Was surprised at how much rumble this thing produces for the price
5,Installed this as part of a surround sound system.  The sub does a great job doing what sub's do - I'm not an audiophile but definitely appreciate the fullness and complete spectrum that my system now has.  Price was good and it looks great in my living room.
5,i was a littl worried it was so cheap. but upon hooking it up it fills the room. i have a large room 30X20 i sitt in the farthest corning and it still rummbles my seat. it is definatly a good by alot of boom for your buck.
5,I've bought two of these. Both are amazing subwoofers. The basses are low and loud. I got bored and decided to hook it up in my car using a DC-AC inverter. Fantastic Car Audio Subwoofer as well as home theater. I will be buying another one to dedicate to my car.
5,I have bought 3 of these they are cheap and sound great. You cannot beat them for the price. My only tip is to watch them  until they go down in price. I got mine when they were 79 dollars.Put them on your watch list and check it daily thats the easiest way.
5,Replaced an infinity 15' subwoofer that I never turned up past 50% this fills its space perfectly turned up to about 75% for about $500 less!!
5,This subwoofer is self amplified and coupled with a Vizio soundbar it is a great combination. You don't need to buy a receiver to have great sounding music and movies. This is really really nice. By the way my house shakes.
5,Awesome sound pick up the tsi series if you want an incredible sounding system just keep a few bucks for you noise disturbance worth e $
5,The quality of construction the sound the price.
5,A nice little subwoofer from Polk and it works great as a part of my home theater setup.
5,amazing sound from my set up now. So glad i finally made the purchace
5,Paired with Bose mains and Pioneer SP-BS22-LR rears in a fairly small listening space it works great. Setup is crucial - take the time to do it right (do not overbalance).
4,For under $100 this is hard to beat.  My only complaint is when its near limits there is a decent amount of port noise that can get a little annoying
5,Very fast delivery 1 day.This is more than enough for a living room where u have neighbors that complain about ur music or movies. i had to reduce reciver to -5 and the gain on the sub to 50 is really loud.
5,Very satisfied with this purchase. It is for my office at home which is a 10x15 feet room. Ideal for a room this size. Only hitch is the sound quality suffers if you turn the speaker up all the way. But that would happen for all but the most expensive subwoofers.
5,REPLACED A THEATER SOLUTIONS 10 IN. SUB. WITH THIS POLK. WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! NO MUDDINESS AT ALL! NICE CLEAR BASS.
5,For the price you can't beat this sub. Plenty of power and control
5,I have a somewhat small house about 1000 sq ft and I would not want anything more powerful than this. I'm pretty sure the neighbors are already pissed off.
4,This little baby is amazing for the money. It works great for music. Just a little goes along way to open up your speakers by relieving them from the low end task. I have tried it with a variety of listening tests. It has earned its place in my music environment.
5,i ended up buying two of em...excellent home theater addition  booming base on muisic and movies
5,shipping was fast and the packing of this item was ok the sub woofer just the thing I was needing now the sound is nice
5,Deep heavy bass. But at low volume to much bass but still good. Also it is very big.
5,I have been using this sub for about a month now and it is awesome.  I have only been running it at about 40% bass and it does the job and more.  I am afraid of turning it up past 50% as it would most likely upset my neighbors.
5,I got two of these speakers based on the reviews and connected it to my Onkyo 717 (7.2).  I could not be more impressed by the quality of the sound from these woofers.Plus managed to get $70 deal for each.  Its worth every penny.
5,Works great
5,Subwoofer has excellent sound. Can't beat the price. Would definitely recommend product.
5,Fantastic Sub Very good sound.  Easy setup.  Highly recommend... Cant beat it for the price
5,I was going to get a significantly higher priced subwoofer (rokit) but this being very affordable did not disappoint the bass is fantastic...
5,Works good but have to adjust the base a lot depending on the TV/movie.
5,Great product
5,Clear and loud bass. Exactly what I needed for my surround sound system.
4,nice subwofer
4,Good sound nicely made a bit bulky!
5,Loud and high quality. Perfect for the price. I use it for my home theater shakes the whole house.
5,Nice. It has left and right RCA inputs. So if your amp has a mono single RCA output be sure to order an adapter.
5,Outstanding quality and sound. You could spend thousands more and not beat these speakers. Incredible bass!
5,Paired with a pair of T50 towers = great audio.
5,Superior sound quality
5,Wow!!! for $100 this has got to be the best sounding sub woofer I have ever purchased!  I have it in a 30'x30' Mancave and it delivers plenty of bass for my needs.  Polk has always put out quality products and this 10" sub is no exception....I would definitely recommend this product!
5,One of the best values I have seen lately.  Great sound...  clean clear sound at aall volume levels.  Adjustments on the back make it versatile for most any room design etc.  Once again a great value at this price point.  Shipping was a little pricey...
5,excellent size and power for a office room and computer speakers (CR-4) running off sound card
4,Not sure why it didn't come with a sub input but works and sounds great.
5,Phenomenal audio quality. Very very loud. I keep it lower than half volume. I also have a sealed 12in sub by a different brand. This is a lot louder. I'm very impressed with the overall performance. Always buy on sale.
4,This subwoofer is definitely adequate for the price!  It adds much needed bass for watching movies or listening to music.  Not any noticeable distortion but I hardly ever crank it up too loud.
5,This sub rocks! Polk is an awesome brand with quality products! And for $80 I will probably purchase another. Thanks again!
3,After listening to this sub for a year I had to drop my rating a little. It's got nice bass but it gets a little distorted when the volume gets louder. I ended up going with the Dayton 1200 and its got nice good but clearer bass. This sub is ok but people that want better home theater experiences will want something a little better.
5,This thing is stupid powerful for 99 bucks
5,Very good sound from a $90 subwoofer. Not too expensive and gives just enough base that you're looking for.
5,Best subwoofer for the money. If you don't want to spend big or if you want to simply upgrade a stock unit this is the woofer. I'm sure there are better subs but for $65-90 this is the best. I got mine on deal no regrets!
5,Adding additional base to my 2channel receiver
4,Ok sound for the price. Good value
5,I was looking for a replacement sub for my old Velodyne and was looking for a small one. Well when it arrived   I was surprised at its size but after hooking up the Polk   I was pleasantly surprised with its performance. Great sound and even my wife likes it. That says a lot right there.
5,This speaker beyond blew my expectations! The amp is internal. And now my shelf speakers cam concentrate on being just that while the sub handles all the boom!
5,I love it very strong bass. Great Quality
5,Couldn't believe the quality and size of this speaker for what I paid for it.  (90$)
5,after reading all the reviews here on cnet and other websites i bought the woofer not expecting much but a decent subwoofer.well hands down - best bang for you buck.im happy with the bass lever not earth moving as some said but you'll definitely feel it.how did i live without one until now?if you need a basic+ woofer - get it.
5,Excellent
5,For the Pricexx Cant beat it!!!!!I dont use as my primary as i use 4 subs however was a great little addition to my Mans Room.
5,Does everything I wantedSounds great for the priceFeet on the unit don't last over 2 movesBroke all the feet on the first day
5,I bought 2 of these for my 7.2 home theater system. Mindblowing sound. Highly recommended.
5,Loved it. My surround system sounds fantastic now.
5,Using this with a Denon receiver and two tower three-way Pioneer floor-standing speakers. This sub really bumps. I have the crossover at 100 Hz and it sounds very smooth. It can shake the windows has good volume output.
5,For the money it’s amazing.
5,Just like many other components that Polk offers this subwoofer is about half again as big as the one I replaced.  For that however I get a much deeper range and significantly less distortion at high volume.  My last subwoofer would rumble this subwoofer hums.
5,Great quality
5,Unvilievable sound and quality for that price 100 percent recomend
5,When we first moved to our new house I bought one of these for the downstairs system.  Recently we updated the bonus room and I purchased this same subwoofer but this time in black for that room.  They both work great and are an excellent price.
5,Nice sound!  Hooked it up to sengled pulse light bulbs and it works really well. I couldn't be happier.
5,Love it. Great sound and fit in even my large room (20 x 26). Great price too for a great sound.
5,This subwoofer is a excellent buy for enhancing your  listening pleasure I use it on my denon av1219. The sounds is incredible along with my Bose am6 cubes and subcommunity loud speakers and  tannoy sb monitors.the sound is veryfull and  fidelity !
5,Really nice sub to finish out my 7.2 surround sound system. I have it paired with a 80 watt 8in sub and now it really thumps and all ranges of lows sound great after some  fine tuning.
5,Great quality subwoofer and the installation was plug and go.  I would definitely recommend it.
5,what a fun sub... lots of power at an awesome price.  My theatre has come alive since adding this to my system.
5,The price was right and based on other reviews I thought it would be a good addition to my bookshelf speaker surround setup. I am very satisfied with the sound this puts out. I'm not sure how I ever listened to music or watched movies without it! Highly recommended.
5,Great addition to our vinyl stero system!!
5,I love this sub sounds great with all my music and movies. It especially shines when I have the surrond sound kicked up. Gives watching movies an added kick.I can hear the sub outside my house very well when turned up. Hits pretty hard.Polk audio quality for sure. Would buy again
5,This thing is amazing! its huge though just a heads up. Besides the size it is amazing.
5,Sounds really good with deep bass. Only thing is I had to order a special Y-Link cable for it to work. Hopefully it will last longer than the older Yamaha Sub I had before.
5,I have a 2500sqft shop.  It's one large open area.  I have 4 small speakers on the walls  One in each corner.  The system sounds great and sub completely fills the room.  PLENTY of bass for the entire area!  I love it!
5,Upgraded from an old KLH subwoofer. I have a Yamaha receiver and Polk surrounds and it sounds great for my purposes. My living room is about 15' by 20' and this sub sounds very nice.
5,This thing really adds the full low end to your system. Big bang for your buck.
5,love this thing.  great value for the money
5,Quality product. :Quick ship and well worth the investment.  Difference to sound system was incredible...
5,As someone who has always bought JBL This was bought as a gift for someone. I paid over four times as much for a JBL that doesn't sound much better that this. Hard to 'listen' to a sub woofer but you won't be sorry if you purchase this.
5,I have read good things about this speaker and they were true.  Amazons price was way less than anyone else. It has a build in crossover which caused confusion in wiring since my sub-woofer speaker has its own connection on my 5.1 receiver. The sound is rich and non-distorted
5,Amazing sub for the price.  I put this in a very large band room where I teach and it actually fills up the room pretty well.  It would definitely do the job in a moderately sized home theater.  Highly recommended.
4,This 10 has some good range and thump for such an inexpensive unit but does suffer from box rattle during those low shake the room type scenes (Movies Video Games etc.).
5,Great bass for the price. Easily set up with my existing speaker system on my PC with a dual audio to 3.5mm converter cable.
5,An excellent subwoofer for the money. Great sound and versatile inputs and controls. Best I could find on a tight budget. Very happy. It more than does the job even when my system is at very loud volume settings.
5,For the money this is a great add to any system. Makes clean tight bass
3,Base is good only complaint is volume is very low. My guess is amp should be higher output.
5,No Brainer! I bought this guy in 2009 and it's still going strong and actually cheaper than when I bought it. Sounds great lots of hook up/adjustment options to integrate into any set-up. One of those rare almost perfect products especially considering the price.
5,I bought this with an ONKYO shelf system and this thing is awesome at 50 Watts it doesn't sound like it would be good but this thing kicks butt. you wouldn't be disappointed if you use this with a small system if your not trying to blow out the house.
4,Good little subwoofer for the price. It has quite a lot of adjustments you can make and the price is right.
5,I wasn't sure what to expect from this as my JBL 8" woofer had some sort of a meltdown. This thing really rumbles in my family room that is 18x24 and I have it set in the front corner of the room. So far so good.
5,In a small room this will deliver far more than you will ever need! Sounds amazing... Very pleased with the Polk speakers!
5,Excellent bass response for the $$
3,Not sure what all the hype was about this- not as nice as my old one.  It's okay but I would get the larger unit over this the bass sound just isn't that rich to me.
4,I'm not a audofile but I like to watch movies with my kids. This thing provided good bass adding that needed impact to action movies. Price was well below anything local
1,Recieved  this from Amazon Warehouse  deals to be fair. But said only thing wrong was box damage. However the subwoofer looked completely new and never used. I was thinking great deal and then I plugged it in and nothing.  Dead out of the box. I see the good  reviews but his one was a dud. Makes me think it was returned  for the same thing the first time and Amazon employees  never checked its functionality because it still  looked new. Oh well back to Sony which lasted me about 10 years.
5,It is a power full subwoofer.
5,Bought for my parents and they couldn’t be happier.
5,Shopped around based on price this is just as good if not better than my expensive subwoofers! Kicks butt!!
5,I don't even have to review this...Polk Audio always has top quality speakers!
5,If this cost three times as much as I paid I would still be happy.  I have an oversized living room and the acoustics are a challenge.  I took a gamble with this sub...and it paid off.  I couldn't be happier.  $100 amazing value.
3,I’ve tried several different crossover points and volume levels and have come up with an ok low end. Definitely worth $100 but kind of flabby/muddy.
5,This sub sounds really good. Deep bass but adjustable so not overpowering unless that's what you want then it can definitely be overpowering.
5,I've had this since September 2014 and it is still going strong. Highly recommend this product.
5,excellent just as expected from polk-everything that you have heard about the sound and quality is true. would definitely recommend to friends and other people looking for great quality plus sound at a great price.i'm very picky-if it makes it past me-its gotta be very good.service from amazon is great also-you cannot go wrong.
5,The wifey bought this for me for the last Hallmark Holiday.Awesome quality awesome price.Yet another product that keeps me loyal to Polk.This is the main sub for my 7.2 surround sound system and it never disappoints.Again highly recommended.
5,I purchased this item to add to my Denon 7.1 system and it works great. It adds the perfect amount of punch to the movies and songs as needed. It has great sound quality and I will be purchasing another for our bedroom.Thanks for the great part at a excellent price.
3,I saw here some review before buying and i expect something  stronger than what it really was. For the price I pay ($99) still a good choice.
5,don't loose all of the paint off of your walls. she hits hard. Great sound and ease of hookup. adjustable volume controls for external front speakers. adjustable frequency controls. all analog controls so even us older folk can figure this one out.
5,Very easy set up. Sounds great. I listen to a range of music categories and video entertainment.
4,I bought this to use with my new home theater system i just recently bout.  i replaced a none powered sub that came with the system. with what i payed for this product its definatly worth it. for 100 bucks it has a pretty good sound.
5,I bought two for my living room and these speakers are very loud and powerful! Love them and great for a residential setup.
5,One of the good sub woofer
3,I bought this woofer because I own a pair of Polk SDS studio reference speakers. This woofer is OK but I am unimpressed with the performance. Output is NOT room commanding as the current rhetoric states. It makes bass but the response is not significant.
5,Can't go wrong with Polk audio.  This little sub shakes the whole house.  For the price this is definitely the best money can buy.
3,Very good sub but has a hi level music shut off so you don't blow the sub.good for domestic use not hi end loud speakers
5,I think I upset me neighbor with this device know that the cable slots require dual rca and not a single male cable as my last sub did.
2,Any suggestions...just bought and a low rumbling sound can be heard. This happens when hooked up as well as not hooked up to RCA cables. My thought is that is may have been damaged during shipping. Amazon was real helpful and told me to return it and send me one out the next day shipping. I have it hooked up to a Sony home theater receiver with two speakers and a Polk center speaker...anyone have this problem? I hope it's just a defect...sounds good other than that
5,Awesome subwoofer really cranks out the bass.
4,Although it is a 10" lower powered sub it will do the job for most basic home surround systems. With a little tuning it works better than most any subs included in those cheap home surround systems.
5,plays pretty good has a tiny hum to it when not in use.
5,Polk Audio Subwoofer is a great addition for a home theatre system and to increase your music listening experience. This subwoofer provides great depth for those who enjoy lots of thump to those who enjoy less thump. The audio is crystal clear. A great product for the right price!
5,Big upgrade at reasonable price.
5,Sounds awesome and complements my in wall polk speakers! Sound is crisp without being too much bass! Absolutely worth every penny! You won't be disappointed!
5,Super Easy to set up. I only needed one wire to connect to my soundbar. It is much bigger than expected but it rattles pictures off the wall if I want it to
5,I absolutely love this Sub. It's got great sound especially when paired with other Polk speakers and a really good receiver. It does get some port turbulence when listening at higher levels but it's not too bad. Great for the price!!
5,Excellent bass for the size and price!
5,WOW!!  This sub is worth every penny. It does well playing music of all genres and also sounds amazing with movies explosion's shake my house!!
5,Awesome subwoofer powerful bass. Greater sound by far than any other in its class.
5,I got it to match my dads first one the two as a pair are fantastic alone it thumped together they shake the neighborhood.
5,Small in size but it lets you know it's in the room...
5,Incredible I bought this subwoofer for under $100 dollars and it sounds comparable to a $300  dollar sub. I could not be any happier.
4,This is a great subwoofer. It is a bit more than I actually need so I only "liked" it. It is top quality and has many options for use. (Too many for me...)
5,BOOM BOOM BOOM!!! This sub rocks!
5,Love it sounds bangin arrived early 2👍5stars all around!!!!!
5,Excellent controls but best is that in auto it senses the signal and turns itself on and off. Great Sub for the money. It's Polk.
5,Nice punchy bass. I paired it with a powered LyxPro speaker. Now I can listen to my reggae just the way I like it.
5,I paired this subwoofer with a set of Polk Tsi1000 speakers.  It was a quantum leap in improvement over my older Polk tower speakers.  Once the subwoofer is dialed in the way you like it you'll be pleased.  And the price is just amazing.
5,Enjoying and some what surprised at the performance of this inexpensive subwoofer. Would recommend highly!
5,I bought this sub to go with a oynko stereo and have been very pleased with results. I trusted polk because I already own one of their sound bars for my plasma and it draws praises from everyone who hears it. You cannot go wrong with this cab.
5,The logo on the front fell off... awkward..ANYWAYS it's a well made product and I love the quality.
5,Great subwoofer. I leave it at 50%. I am afraid that if I turn it up any higher everything including my walls and windows will collapse around me. =}
5,Amazing is all that I have to say. My wife hates it and closes the bedroom door. 😂😂😂
5,This subwoofer has high reviews for a reason.  It delivers when it needs to and doesn't overdo it when you don't want it to.  Would definitely buy again.
5,I like this product alot . It works well with my home entertainment system. Witch is a Samsung 51" plasma 3D TVand a Samsung 3D dvd player and a Yamaha RX-V367 3-D receiverand Klipsch speaker system. It's bass is well balanced with the system and not overwhelming.
4,The subwoofer is awesome. Only problem I found is when it's making too loud the frame is making some noise. I'm pretty sure this is a construction problem and Polk guys must correct this. Otherwise it's really awesome. I love it.
5,For the price and wattage amount this is awesome for a small studio and Netflix or something. I have two of them and its packing a nice punch!
5,I bought this sub for my RV to pack some punch to my stereo system and adjust the bass as needed. Great sound for a medium sized room and Polk Audio always has excellent quality. Arrived in no time and at a discounted price. Very pleased!
5,I can't say enough good things about these. Worth every penny.
5,The sound output has been amazing.  Polk has never let me down.  I'm glad I switched to Polk
5,Great sound! Works well for me!
5,This sub blows away my old one and relatively cheap. I give it 5 stars.
5,Awesome subwoofer for the money...
2,Not sure the 5 star reviews Bought it based on the reviews really wanted to like and keep it but the bass sounds horrible. It's a very loose and distorted. Had it for 30 mins and knew it had to be returned.
5,This is a well built device that produces very clean bass even at very high level. It pretty much makes my entire house shake then I use it. For that price it's beat all my expectations and I've gotten quite a few compliments from people about it.
5,Sounds Great.
4,it's a hundred bucks.  if you want  hard thumping base spend more.  if you just want to augment front speakers this does the job.
5,works great with my older stero.
5,I got this subwoofer to supplement my Elan MC650 in walls and in ceiling speakers. And I have to say it fills the room with a very nice rich bass. At very loud levels you can hear a bit of port noise and very low frequencys are muffled. But overall a fantastic sub.
5,Perfect!!!! Sounds perfect work perfect beautifull finishes comfortable controls zero distortion and great deal for the price.
5,Great item - better quality than available at our local Best Buy
5,Great addition to my surround system
5,Haven't cranked past 25% bc it we would possible crumble my house to the ground.
5,Great subwoofer!  Good value for the price and puts out a lot of bass.  Looks pretty nice in my living room also.
5,This thing pounds! I put this in my 15 by 38 theatre room.  Has deep tones and sounds great.  Could only turn about half way up.  It shakes the house! Great buy
5,Amazing bass not yoo huge!
5,It met all my expectations and more... It was bday gift for husband and he loved it.. It's so incredible my dog barks at the sounds Bc it sounds so real...
5,I love this SUB !!! It Rocks Big time !! I hope to get years of service out of it too !!
5,This is a beast. Even on low settings it makes its presence known. My only complaint: why doesn't it include a cable?
5,Sounds good simple setup (although I did purchase the y cable to make it simple to use).
5,Great price works perfect with matching speakers
3,Not bad...spend a few extra + get a Klipsch.  I returned this Polker.
5,very good value---sounds great---i would give it 6 stars if i bought it 2 days later @ $89.99
5,Very inexpensive to add some bass in the house. This puppy shakes the floor when you want it to. 50 watts and 10" doesn't sound like much but it actually is more than enough for a home system or hooked into your surround like I have mine.
5,I paired the PSW 10 with a Polk Audio SurroundBar 42 and a Pioneer VSX 1019-AH and it simply rocks.  When wired correctly the bass seems spacial as opposed to directional and it immerses whole room.  It took some tweaking to get proper crossover and volume set but once it's found you'll be very pleased.
5,Flexible inputs and controls with really warm sound. Paired with some small infinity speakers (outside!) and it sounds wonderful.
5,Couldnt be happier spending $79.99 for the sound this sub has. Quite frankley i was suprised that it sounded as good as it does.Perfect for the small room iam using it in.And yes i would recomend this product to a friend.In closingIam very happy with this purchase.
2,It worked for about 3 days and then the amplifier quit working.
5,So much power for my 20' x 13' room. I barely have them cranked and I feel the bass in my chest. Yes!
4,what can i say this polk sub is great for the money cant go wrong with it at all really wonderful  sub
5,More power than I need. It works great with my new Sony surround system. Two cable ports; i'm only using one to get the sound. Don't know what the second one is for don't seem to need it.
5,Met my expectations
5,Nice one - great sound and quality - being sued actively pretty much every day !
5,Great sound at an amazing price.
5,Great sounding sub without breaking the bank.
5,Es lo mejor en preciosonidocalidad y potencia.Se lo recomiendo!!!....
1,After having this subwoofer for approx. 2 1/2 months I can honestly say that without a doubt it is the worst speaker/powered  subwoofer I have ever owned.......noticed about 30 days into owning it that there was a cracking sound and then I had some friends over to watch a new release movie and they all said that it was blown! I Seperated the subwoofer by itself and lo & behold it sure was! Sadly I know I cannot send back to Amazon so I am at a loss as to what to do!? Very upsetting......as I didn't play it recklessly  nor did I play it irresponsibly..by the way this is my 9th surround sound system (upgraded each time)  but only my 3rd powered subwoofer and it has been the worst..!
5,Husband hooked it up and it looks nice and sounds good to his 60 year old ears
4,Nice powered sub.  Fine for average sized rooms.  Good adjustability with the volume and crossover controls.  Nice compact size  for easy placement.
5,This thing really shakes the walls.  Take your home theater to the next level.  For $100 you can't go wrong with this sub.  I will end up buying another when I go from my 5.1 to a 7.1 system.
5,The 10" speaker does just fine on the low end.
5,I'd give this more stars if I could it's amazing!
5,I bought this sub to go with a pair of Monitor 40s CS1 center and Sony STR-DH710.  It is an excellent addition.  It is great for both music and home theater movies.  If you care more about sound quality and looks than vibrating the neighbors house this is the sub for you.
5,Watching movies on you laptop? The sound will blow you away!
5,Thunderous...Awesome.  Wife got me a Vizio sound bar for my birthday with no sub picked this bad boy up on amazon and it has complimented the sound bar wonderfully the sound from the bar is clean now i have the rumble to go with it.
5,This is a replacement for a much more expensive Audio Research 12" powered sub. It is much cleaner sounding and has the very important auto on/off missing from our previous sub. For the price it really can't be beat. Highly recommended.
5,AAA amazing!
5,With the decent soundbar for you HDTV....it will turn your room into a theater. Got the full effect of the theater when I watched star trek into darkness
5,STOP THINKING ABOUT IT and DO IT!  This is one of the best $100 I've ever spent!  Better get it at that price while you can this thing is a beast!
5,My 350.00 JVC took a dump so I opted for this Polk because of the reviews. Sounds every bit as good for 100.00 delivered!! I don't have a super powered amp but it thumps good and works great with the sound surround! Highly recommended!
5,I have 2 of these in a 7.2 setup. They are fantastic. They really shake the room with clean bass down to extreme lows.
5,I have had this sub for 1 week now and I am impressed. It does not get the real lows like in some rap songs...But for Mid-Lows it sure pounds! I am completely happy with this. It feels more powerful than just 50 watts RMS. A great Sub!
5,This was my first subwoofer that I bought and I'm very satisfied. It has stood the test of time and goes beyond how deep and loud I would need it to be. For $100 this thing is a fantastic deal.
5,Awesome great for the price. Would compare to subs that are twice as much. A+
5,This subwoofer came quickly and matched our black electronics perfectly. The sound it produces easily outdoes the old Sony Sub we've had for ages and you immediately appreciate music and movies more in the home. Quality product that does exactly what we hoped it would.
5,We purchased this for our surround sound on an onyko receiver and it has been fantastic.
5,Just got it today and have been using it for about 30 minutes. Sounds great and giving my television viewing good bass.
5,Been using for over a year now great sound I have it turned down and it still has epic sound. Great for movies games and music.
5,Love the look the sound and price will be ordering another one.
2,Better than nothing. Sounds ok at low levels (movies) though it becomes distorted and easily overwhelmed at even moderate levels.
5,Bass is amazing.  At first my wife hated it from not having this much bass in the past. Now she is loving it with 6.1 booming to a good action movie!
4,Good subwoofer.. Hits hard plenty of boom during movies and video games.
5,I bought this based on a great price (<$100) and am delighted.  I inherited an old TV sound system with great surround sound speakers but no sub-woofer.  The Polk is easy to set up and easily adjustible.  And the sound is glorious.
5,Sounds awesome wish I'd bought this way back definitely makes my home theater audio much better.The unit is much larger (and heavier) than I had assumed but definitely worth it.
5,Sounds great just what I wanted. Room is 15x20 & it is more than adequate. Glad I bought it & would recommend it unless you are looking to spend $400 or more.
5,Added this to a ZVOX 555 sound bar to round out the sound.  Nice addition!  It's almost too much.  We have it turned down.  Opinions vary but we really like it.
5,This is a value sub woofer and for the price and excellent buy.  Would recommend this to the average consumer who does not know a lot about audio equipment and is looking for a good product at a fair price.
4,Perfect fit for the surround sound set-up in the bedroom (18x16). Sounds great... performing up to spec. For the price ($100.00) would definitely recommended.
5,Thunderous bass for the money.  Great add to our basement home theater.
5,Excellent subwoofer for the price. Not only does the bass sound great but it took the burden off my surround speakers so they sound much better too. Great purchase.
5,Very nice what it adds my movies & music i wonder why had not used subwoofers years ago
4,Not a BOSE but gives enough quality sound for the value!
4,Decent for the money.
5,Fantastic equipment. Trusted performance and great price. Wonderful addition to a surround system. Great packaging and on time delivery.
5,Wow!!  Long live Polk very good punch and clean true Sub sounds for a 10" in fact I got 2 about to get the 12" with a lower feq.  And rock hard bass y'all you heard!!
4,Good price  decent sound..
5,Bought this subwoofer to add some bottom end to my Focal bookshelf speakers. Just goes to show you don't need a lot of wattage to get a nice sound. I live in an apartment with noise rules and this subwoofer has complimented my audio/video system nicely...Great features easy to set up.
5,I absolutely love this woofer I have a 10 inch Yamaha for our theater room and this one delivers much better bass for music dosen't work as well for movies but it is about half the price.
5,It rocks my room! Have had it about 1 year i have a Bose sourond sound and it just did not have the boom that i like.Added this Polk and it will shake the walls tell the pictures Fall!!! LOVE IT :-)
4,It sounds pretty good. The only con is it gives off a lot of airey noise when turned up. A bigger speaker would be better for me.
5,Good sub and has a lot of options.My son is upswing this sub with a set of bookshelf speakers and they sound pretty good.He mostly plays xbox and wii and sometimes from the Apple TV.
5,You can buy better but not in this price range. I love these.  Definitely the best value out there in my opinion
5,Great sub for indoors especially since it's a powered sub. Give's you the bass you need.
5,Very hard to beat ate this price point
3,It's pretty decent for the price but I would definitely buy something else if I had to again.
5,Works very well with my old-school Bose 501s. Plenty of punch.
5,Goes well with my equipment as a replacement for my 20 year old subwoofer.
5,Just what I needed
5,So far so good! Great sounds!
5,Was looking for a subwoofer that delivered ooomph for a great viewing/listening experience that wouldn't bust my wallet. This subwoofer delivers a house full of sound and heightens the experience to the max though my wife won't let me turn it all the way up!
5,I have 2 of these setup in my living room and constantly get positive feedback about them from guests saying how good my surround sound sounds with these.
5,The variable LPF is a nice touch
5,Polk Audio has been making quality stereo product for years.  When I say this bass speaker I had to have it.  You will not be dissatisfied with this purchase.  It works very well with my TV sound bar.
4,Has good sound for the size and price. Does not shake the room but adds nice base to stereo.
5,I got this to use with my Denon DM39 system which I thought already sounded pretty good.  This adds all the bottom end it needs and greatly improved the sound.  Good solid bass really has to over-driven to distort.
5,Great sound with Denon Receiver.
5,I put it head to head with other more expensive brands and models.Got it for Xmas two years ago for around $100. Match perfect with my Mission speaker system.It has good power and nice leveled bass. Not too fluttery. Great for medium sized rooms.
3,I eagerly hooked it up to my Home Theatre system but discovered it just made a buzzzzzing sound. So I called Amazon and they arranged return labels and I returned it immediately through UPS.  I think I have received credit but I have not checked lately.  My wife found it to be too bulky and ugly for our family room!
5,Good bass for the price.
5,Absolutely worth every cent spent on this subwoofer. It provides the extra bass I've been missing in my music. This sub is perfect for any person looking for a powerful subwoofer with great sound quality at an affordable price.
5,Worth every penny!!!
5,Love this product sounds great
5,Bass This is a wonderful sub. Easy on the pocketbook to boot. After all the reviews cant go wrong with this one.
5,Great sound and incredible value! I had fairly low expectations based on the price and wattage of the amp but I'm extremely satisfied and would recommend it without any hesitations.
5,This is a great powered Sub for the price. I used it for our entertainment system. It can easily blast us out of our room. LOL It seems very clear and has good response.
2,At first the bass was ok but after a year plus of usage I noticed that the lows are very distorted the speaker sounds like it's blown so I think I will hook up a different 10" speaker and it should work fine!!!
5,Shipped fast and in good condition works and sounds great! Highly recommend it great value for the money.
5,I bought this for $69.99 from amazon so I figured I had nothing to lose. Fantastic sub for the money. Wait for it to go on sale as it typically does. Do not pay more than $100 and you will be happy.
5,1-2-3 hook up. Excellent quality
5,I got this on a super great deal don't know how much they cost now but at $100 it was one of the best audio bargains I've ever found.  Easily worth almost twice the price I paid IMO.
5,great bass and sound
5,Works great and nice price
5,Just like every one has been saying this is an great sub. The sound is booming and fills my room with that thumping bass.
5,Really great sub; it's actually so loud of a low tone and rumble that I have to turn it off. Darn parents have to sleep. Would highly recommend if you want low but loud bass.
2,As simple as the headline you get what you pay for. Its a cheap subwoofer. Its not accurate it doesnt sound great. Its boomy...If you dont care much and just need a cheap subwoofer this is for you. If you want good sounding bass go elsewhere.
5,Sounds great. Looks great
4,Great subwoofer for the price.
5,Great bass sound with plenty of adjustability to fine tune your preference
5,I love this subwoofer. I have it paired to a Zvox 580 and together they make watching movies and listening to music a much greater experience. The price they both sell for on Amazon makes it a no brainer.
5,I have 2 of these............. they may not be your high end sub but they are not too bad.  Not as good as my high end sub but for the money a great value.  They are well packed when you order one.
5,This puts out some serious sound from my Surround Sound without being boomy. I'm sure my neighbors upstairs are wondering if I have a 300-pound rabbit hopping around in my apartment. Solid well-made great sound. Tough to beat at this price!
5,Wonderful addition to my surround sound system
4,Sounds very good to me...but sometimes I have a problem getting the volume just right...but that's just me?.
5,Powerful subwoofer generates strong low frequency sounds.  Excellent for listening to videos with explosions etc. as well as music. Rock-and-roll just like Woodstock. Highly recommended.
5,This thing is awesome. Definitely all the bass I need and I don't even have it turned up that high.
5,you can go wrong this this sub. it hits  hard in music and video. i have it in a corner and it shakes the window drives the cat crazy also have a polk 8" in the front. would highly recommend this to anyone.
5,very good! love it in my room for listening to dubstep! bass feels amazing... like im at a actual concert
5,I tried some powered subwoofer beforebut disappointedthen had to remove them because the unwanted soundnoise came out from there.Now I think I found the one I needwith the little money I spent (less than $100).I  got a real movie theater at home.....Thank you Polk Audio for fulfil my dream.
5,I had to replace a 10 year old NHT sub -  in town NHT dealer said to old to fix. New model $600. OUCH!!This Polk model is great- love it. And price sealed the deal.  Very happy.
5,Polk Audio delivers evertime. Works well with my Onkyo 7.2 AVR. I put two of these in my home theater and they deliver. My friends and family are impressed with how these units transforms the room. Lifelike. I also love the power save option.
5,Love it...
5,Nice addition to my home theater Polk Audio center and floor speakers. I setup option #1 per the manual and now the bass come to live. Wish I had purchased this Sub sooner. Highly recommend.
5,wired this through the speaker inputs and outputs with my jbl n24s and a pyle 40 watt amp. sounds GREAT! no complaints but this is also the first subwoofer i bought. Preference is the biggest factor i guess but i love this and i hope you do/will too :D
5,Nice deep bass from this guy. Looks good and sounds good. Great value.
5,Great for music...paired up with my Yamaha stereo receiver and speakers (8 1/2" drivers...3 way)...plenty of punch...along with my Denon DP-300F turntable with Ortofon 2m Red cartridge makes a nice budget audiophile system. Amazed how good my vinyl sounds
4,Good product I would buy again
1,While cheap it doesn't really add to a desktop or small stereo system as there is serious port noise.  Tried with two different subs of this model.  The first sub had a hum and didn't auto-off.  This one (2nd attempt) distorts at any volume at low frequencies due to the port design.  To really see how the port fails try 'Fading Sun' under the Winder Songs (icemusic) album by Terje Isungset.  Either the sub has an issue with quality control or it isn't designed for the lower-end frequencies and should limit.  Shame.  Will be returning.
5,HOLY SH*T! That’s is all
5,I have this as part of my surround set up with Polk 70s in the front CS2 center Monitor 40s for side surround and Monitor 30s for rear surround.  They all sound awesome and I'm using a Pioneer VSX-1121-K 7.1 receiver.
5,Absolutely great subwoofer great price. I bought this to add a second subwoofer to my setup now it sounds like I am at concerts or in a theatre!
5,Great value
5,Good sub for the price
4,Very happy thus far. The woofer is a very slick color and small enough to fit under a table.  And the sound is fantastic with my Yamaha RX-V473 5.1-Channel Network AV Receiver.
5,Thumps!  great buy.  just because its inexpensive doesn't mean its not badass!
5,Should have got one a long time ago I am pleased. Read a lot of review's and they were all positive for cost and performance I would agree. Great product and nice looking (black finish). For my system this is a great addition.
5,The sound and bass is crazy  hooked this up to my home theater system and football basketball games on tv sound amazing!! Movies umm lets just say you won't be unhappy with the performance of this speaker.
5,Very good sound for the price!
5,I knew something was missing with the sound from my HDTV... a Yamaha receiver and 2 Sony tower speakers were ok but the sound was lacking. Adding the Polk Audio PSW10 to the set-up made all the difference in the world! Everything sounds wonderful now!
5,This thing rocks!  It works perfectly with my home theater system. I have a tiled floor in my living room and vaulted ceilings. It's an acoustic nightmare. This subwoofer works flawlessly to overcome the obstacles. It is infinitely adjustable for various locations.
4,its not exacly what i thought but i really do like it over all their is nothing about this that i would take back i like it.
5,I am very happy with the performance of the Polk audio product. It has provided robust low frequency response and suits my theatre room perfectly. It is just right without overpowering the supporting speakers.
5,Great deep sound while watching movies or sports.  Easy to set up also.This subwoofer provides a lot of deep bass even when the volume isnt that loud.  This has turned TV watching into a true cinema experience.
5,Not an audiophile but think I got more than my money's worth in this speaker...have actually had to really crank down on the volume to not resonate throughout that part of the house...Good speaker for the price in my opinion...
5,Suitable for a bedroom. Doesn't make enough bass for a party in say your living room or basement but it will quake your bedroom. If you are looking for bass thumping your chest this is not it.
3,I am sure this is a great product but way to big for the space.  I returned this item free of charge.
5,Sounds good
1,Seven months of use playing easy listening music at low levels and the speaker has a load hum and then continues to blow fuses. Not a very good product. I know it wasn't expensive and it has a good warranty but why can't it just work for a long time? Why do I have to go to the trouble to get it replaced or repaired. QA is lacking built in quality lacking just lacking all around. Will look for a replacement subwoofer from another company. First and last Polk Audio purchase.
5,I love it
5,Sounds good and looks good
5,Love this sub. Sounds awesome. I placed it behind my entertainment center in the corner ofy living room. When I want to I can vibrate the pictures off my wall :). Love it.
5,For the money these things thump!
5,We are using this Polk sub-woofer with Jamo speakers and a Sony Receiver. Only one RCA cable to connect it directly to the Sony DH520 Receiver and wow what nice deep bass. Well work the money as it is priced right at Amazon!
2,I am a longtime Polk fan but after I purchased this sub I ended up returning it.  Its a good price for sure and to be fair there is probably nothing else that is all that much better in this price range..  But the performance just isn't there.  It's not loud enough or deep enough and lacks the presence that you expect from a home theater subwoofer.  I was using it in my fairly small bedroom and it still did not give me anywhere near the impact I was looking for.  I replaced it with a 12 inch BIC sub that I found on sale for not that much more and it hits a LOT harder.
4,Very nice sub
5,Wow what a difference this makes compared to my old one. The base is crisp and clear. well worth the money.
5,excellent bass for my otherwise mediocre 5.1  home stereo
5,Perfect! Sounds great really thumps!
5,Just got this sub-woofer and paired it with my Polk center speaker and I'm loving my sound system now. Both powerful speakers for a great price.Thanks amazon. I  recommend both speakers.
5,This is a fine subwoofer!  I’m so glad I bought it.
5,I want to eventually get the CV 12 but its $500.00This alternative for $99.00 is adequate and well worth the money. This thing bumps well for the price. If on a budget I recommend this.
5,Excellent entry level subwoofer: if all you're looking for is to round out the bottom end of your system and you're not an audiophile nut I can't find any other deal on the internet that matches this one.
5,love the sound and the different way to hookup
5,Lol i was waiting to buy this and im so happy i finally did now have to buy 2 more! Great Great product and buy
5,Sf movies an acción
5,Great subwoofer.  Fills the room with enough oooomph to vibrate the walls.  And for the price you can't beat it.  I had purchased Polk speakers for a vehicle a few years ago and they worked great.  Very well built.
5,Can't find a better value for a powered sub from a brand you and trust!
5,Can’t beat it at this price.
4,great sound... fast shipping. I did have a problem with the price.  It was 20 dollars cheaper 2 days later. I call to complain but when I went back to check the price was 10 dollars more??? so if not in a hurry check prices for a couple days.D.Rooster
5,Ah yes the polk subwoofergot here much faster then I expectedit has put the finishing tuch on my home theater systemthe unit is of fine qualityeasy setup and great sound...did not realize what I was missingnow I knowthe Polk PSW10has made my system complete..........
4,Polk Audio PSW10 - Very nice performance for music as well as in the movie. I love this subwoofer.
5,I like it.  The sound just perfect for my room.
5,This is now one of my favorite subwoofer! Love the clarity of the sounds... And the boom sound! Speechless. Highly recommended subwoofer for all music & movie lover! Thanks!
4,Good product with a decent price. The only issue I had was that it took me a while to hook it up with my sound system. Looks like the option 1 doesn't work. Have to use option 2. But once it's hooked up correctly it works perfect.
5,Surprised how much LFE improved over the 3-way speakers I had with 15" subs in them.  Crisp response.
5,Great value and great sound. I like the flexibility with the crossover and volume settings. Very powerful for a relatively low wattage sub. I don't have any problems with distortion.
4,This subwoofer is nice for the price. I bought this to replace a more expensive subwoofer I am having repaired. It sound just about the same. You can't go wrong with this sub for music ...and the price is right!
1,Product died 2 months after warranty expired. But that's not what bothered me. The fact that I only use the product for such a short period of time like I did not get to enjoy it. I'm not home much and only use it like once a month. I should have gone with Bic America. They have 5 year warranty on the whole sub. Customer service wants $150 to replace a board. Like half the price of the sub I didn't even use that much.
5,Sounds great after selecting the correct sound field on the receiver.  The speaker does have a cover over the front which I was not sure of just looking at the picture.
5,Kick ass base for the price.  We're thrilled with it.
5,Nice subwoofer! Select the music and out pops the base!
5,Deepclean and wide bass.
5,I bought this sub-woofer to compliment  my Polk Audio R150  in a 2.1 setup. All I can say is PERFECT!  Deep rich bass: Just Great.  This is an entry level system but if your not an extreme Audiophile you'll be more than satisfied.
5,This sucker rattles the glasses in the cupboard no problem.  Easy to set up and I like the manual bass control on the back for quick turn up/down without having to go through a bass speaker setup.
5,Sub works great! Can’t beat the price for the sound you get.
4,I'm having trouble typing this message now because all I can here is the BOOM BOOM BOOM from my sub-woofer.
5,I've never been a huge fan of Polk speakers but this sub has far exceeded my expectations-especially for the bargain price!
5,Sounds good. Plenty of power probably more than I need. It's pretty big too. But now my system with a 90w receiver and bookshelf speakers sounds incredible. And it was very easy to hook up.
3,Humming noise  when audio is low.Adjusted everything that could possibly be adjusted and used high quality wires to sub.Still hums.
5,This thing is an awesome entry level speaker. Love it
5,I paired this subwoofer with a compact speaker system built by Klipsch that has a sub-woofer out jack (and needed it).  I like the combined result--fills the room nicely not boomy or muddled at all--just crisp clear bass.
5,Perfect for my old home stereo
4,Sounds good overall...
5,I love it!!!!
5,Love
5,This sub is great! I have outlived several other subs paid more and got less. I love this for music and it is above average for movies. Great deep bass guitar  spectacular explosions in action films. Who could ask for more?
5,High quality sound from an inexpensive speaker.  Set-up is easy.
5,I'm using this subwoofer to compliment my Behringer Portable Euro 150 pa system and I couldn't be happier. The bass response is very adjustable and truly delivers on it's low end capabilities. You cannot beat the price for such a subwoofer anywhere.
5,Speaker came on time and in perfect condition! I love it can't say the same for the wife. This is a replacement for a Sony that had an encounter with some H2O the water won.  Very happy with the speaker and have recomended it to friends. Jon
5,Great subwoofer at a fair price.
5,just right great sound for movies
4,Nice sub at good price.
5,good bass so far especially playing Wonder Woman through the surround sound.
5,This is a great sub. I live in an apt so cranking it up is not possible. I wanted a sub that would sound great and not cost a bunch of money and this one fit the bill perfectly.
5,Great sound for the price.
5,I was looking for a subwoofer to supplement the audio for an older whole house stereo system. It provides the bass that was previously missing from my sound system.
2,Boomy mess.  I paired this with my YAS-107 sound bar and no matter what settings I used or set the filters and gain on the bass the sound was very muddy and did not blend with my sound bar.  If you want Boom then this is it if you want clean and rich bass look elsewhere.
5,Could not be easier to install.  You do need that RCA cable.  But that's it...and boy does it rock the music.  I have to actually turn it way down most of the time...what a joy!
5,Carries the bass throughout my 3000 sq ft house. Quick delivery in two days.
3,Good enough sound for second in 9.2 system. Was a bit bummed when I saw the lack of connection available but made it work wirelessly so good to go. Nothing better than a subwoofer on each end of the couch and this Polk works fine for vibrating during the action.
5,Amazing sound for the price I paid for. Is it quite big but I have the perfect place for it. Unfortunately it does not have a button to turn it off but I knew it before I purchased it.
5,Very good sound presentation very good.
5,This thing bumps. Just getting ready to order my second one of 4.
5,Great bass
5,This thing will rock the house my receiver is a 5.2 so I will be buying another one soon.
5,Really happy with this it's a great value.  However my room is 20x20 and I wish I would have gone with the 12-inch sub instead of the 10 I max it out every once in a while.
5,thanks polk audio and thanks amazon because this sub is so much worth the small amount i paid
5,Great product and performance for the price.
5,Bought this on prime day wish I'd gotten it sooner!! Makes a world of difference on my system sounds great.
5,For a 10 inch subwoofer the bass is more than expected and I'm using it at half its full volume capability. I'd recommend it to a friend.
5,WOW!  What this product did for my home theater is just amazing.  I never want to go to a movie again!
5,got the extra bass i wanted for cheap. id like more bass so i might buy another . it realy added alot to my music for sure .
5,This is a great subwoofer!  Provides me with the extra BOOM when needed.
5,Awesome bass is really really good shakes my windows
5,Holy cow!!!  Didn't expect this subwoofer to create that much bass.  For some reason it made my bookshelf speakers sound better as well.
5,This thing rocks! I have not had any issues with it.
5,This Polk PSW10 Subwooffer is truly well made. It is heavy and larger than it looks in the picture. When connected my roomssound like a movie theather at time it feels like the whole house is shaking.
5,Everything I wanted and more at an affordable price. It definitely gives me that "boom boom boom" that I was looking for!
5,The 10" subwoofer performed perfectly.  No distortion at low range db.  cabinet and components are well engineered and complement the unit.  The RMS output of 50 watts gives more than ample volume and the bass quality is excellent.
5,Wired this to my Yamaha receiver that I use for my big screen TV and CD player. It works great and really throws out the bass! For the money it is a great subwoofer. Directions for connection were very straightforward.
4,just what I wanted
5,I love this thing! Definitely an improvement over my factory speakers!!
5,deep bass.
5,I'm using this in a 7.1 surround setup and it ROCKS! I am very happy with it. There may be bigger and higher priced sub's but I don't see how they could outperform it. Bass is very good and if you turn it up it'll shake the whole house!
5,Great productSounds great with set of Klipsch bookshelf speakers and hybrid tube amp
5,Plugged it in hooked it up and it worked no problem.
5,Works great
5,What a difference this new sub sounds with my old soundbar.
5,This subwoofer is what I needed and more. Hooked it up to my vizio sound bar and it sounds like thunder. A cover  does come with your subwoofer to protect the speaker.
5,This was the cheapest powered sub I could find for my system and it blew me away. This thing can rattle the pictures off your walls if you wanted it to. Great sub with an excellent price.
5,Great product works well when I hook this up with my home theater and turntable. My home theater has a passive 8" subwoofer (Onkyo) the Onkyo is no match to this!
4,it's an ok product  the bass is not as low as i expected and at low volume it vibrates like crazy !!!! soundes way better with music than movies . but for the price i can't complain to much right ??? lol
5,This thing is amazing!! I have it for my college dorm room hooked to my ps4. At half volume on BF4 it shakes the wall that its next to. You can't do better for 90 bucks.
5,Excellent bass output. I love listening to Daft Punk and 70's-80's music on these. Vanhalen Fleetwood Mac both sound very good bass wise. I wish there was a record store near me....
5,It’s a great bass woofer
5,I have this sub in a converted bedroom and it plays amazingly.
5,Small but powerful
3,Thought it was going to sound better. Spend a little more money to get yourself a better product. Distorts at 3/4 volume
5,I could have spent 2-3 times as much but for the money I saved I could have bought 2 and hooked my 7.2 system.  This Sub works awesome with my system just alone the low's make all the difference..
5,Outstanding quality of sound and power in such a compact unit. Sound quality far better than i had expected. The cost on amazon was half of what the box stores were asking for the exact same speaker.
4,I like the sound but output does not work so how am I supposed to connect the voice speakers to even out the bass n mid range!!
5,Perfect addition to my Samson 8” studio monitors.
5,I was very impressed with the quality of the speaker. after looking through subwoofers in the 100$ price range I believe this is the best option and I was not disappointed after it arrived and I set it up.
4,I works well my polk speakers.  Does not seem to power down when all else is off.  But it will rattle the floor.
5,Sounds great. Actually larger than I thought. It has added a much fuller sound to my Denon Micro system. Love it
5,This unit sounds great for the money. I'm very happy with it.
5,Worth 5x more than cost. Amazing bass and sound quality.  Best paired with beats pill.Update: 3/4/17Just bought another one of these. Still awesome.
5,I like it!
1,Sounds like air coming out of a tube. No comparison to my old psw110
5,more than ample bass for my den and kitchen area large great room type home.  Couldn't be more pleased versus the price of big box store brands that are hardly the same quality as this unit.
5,Nice solid build. Delivers stomping sub notes. Amazing performance for its price
3,It sounds nice.  I wish the light on the back could go off or not be so bright and conspicuous.  Several of the pegs for the grille are broken so the grille doesn't fit snugly onto the subwoofer.
5,I love this speaker. Has plenty of power and made my home theater system complete.
5,Great product. Shakes the floors and walls
1,Stay away from this brand. The quality is very poor and they do not stand behind their products. I have called customer support seven times asking for help and not even a call back. Once they have your money they don't want to know you. Look for other brands that offer customer support.
3,the bass is good for a low in subwoofer.
5,Best value on the market right now. Sounds great.
5,Great song
3,Nice powerful bass but now I know what they mean by the "chuffing sound". Bought everything else in the RTi series and skimped on the subwoofer. I wish I hadnt.
5,Can't beat the sound of this subwoofer for the price a must buy!!
5,The sub came very quickly.  I installed it in no time and it was very easy.  I would recommend this sub if you are looking to spend below $250.  The quality is great for recreation/general homeowner use.
5,Added this to give some rich bass for the low rumbling of movies or deep sounds of music and I was not disappointed. Really adds something to my Polk Audio speakers highly recommend. Note: this is not a small sub-woofer.
5,Very good
5,this was easy to install and set (i am a novice audiophile).  I would recommend this to anyone who cares about components sound and quality but who does not want to invest a lot of money
5,Great product well packaged and sounds awesome.  Upgraded to a Atmos setup with this and movies are a new treat!
5,Love the power and Crisp sound this Sub puts out! Maybe it is my other equipment but for me this sub Is a perfect addition! For the price I would recommend this for sure!!  Hopefully it Holds up :)
5,Great product
5,Unbelievable sub for under $100.  Loving it.
5,Nice Subwoofer a great addition to my 7.2 making it complete. the only bad thing is you have to buy a y plug to make this wotk with your receiver
5,using with a home stereo system looks good and sounds good
5,Cannot beat the performance for the money
5,I sold and installed high end audio gear in NYC and Westchester County for years a while back. Real  sota gear . You would have to spend many times more money to better this product.
5,Very punchy sounds fantastic in my home audio system.
5,For the money you can't go wrong with this woofer.  A lot of bass here.
5,Nice unit.  Works great - the floor shakes.  I like that it has multiple input types and an Auto-ON or always ON switch.
5,provides excellent addendum to  five speaker set  up  previously without an active subwoofer used primarily for classical music and jazz.  room size a bit over  400 sq. ft.  couldnt  be more satisfied for the  quality at this price.
5,Great sound for the price. Can’t go wrong in this price range.
5,I bought this sub to go in my dorm room up at App State. It was worth every penny. Let's just say after I got this thing everyone knew who had the best audio system on our floor xD
5,WOW !!!  This thing really sounds amazing.  Base is so perfect. Absolutely love it.
5,very pleased with the product. great sound is what I expected and more.
5,Teamed up with the Polk RTI A1 bookshelf speakers this sub kicks the bass into 4th gear. Well made good quality and great addition to the system
5,Works great lots of base! perfect for a home theater system.
5,I replaced a non-working passive sub woofer with his one and coupled with the Onkyo TX SR309 receiver it can literally shake our house on it's foundation!  This unit makes having a surround-sound system more than worth it!
5,Great Sub!
5,Love it. Good bass great for tv shows and movies. I definitely notice the difference. Why did I wait so long? Great price but this is an older model. You' ll need extra cables. Absolutely worth it.
4,This is a well-made subwoofer very heavy and solid and does the job.  Not quite as good as my original much more expensive subwoofer but this will do for now.
5,Love the speaker
5,Nice and Bass E perfect for my needs.
5,I hooked it up to my tv. Can't beat it for the money
5,So far so good. It's bigger than what I thought and has some buttons lights and controls in the back. The sound is very good
5,Have had this very several years now. Still works like its brand new. Very good sound and a lot of control of the bass sound.
5,Great unit. Has more power than you will ever use.
5,I live in an apartment so I really can't crank it up. But this unit is amazing.Performs beyond expectations.
5,I. Was amazed at the sound of this subwoofer and the price was right . I would recommend it for someone who is looking for good sound at a. Modest price because you will be very happy with this purchase.
5,This is a big sub but it is not super powerful. it Matches what I needed perfectly. Definitely not a sub for HT but it is really good for music if you do not push it too hard port noise is an issue.
5,Great quality and price.  Haven't really cranked it up but it definitely puts out the BOOM!
5,Nice sub ranges of the hertz spectrum.
4,This subwoofer was definitely worth buying. It completes the surround sound and really packs the bass needed to make you feel like you are at the theaters. Excellent product for the money.
5,This is the first subwoofer I have purchased. It has exceeded my expectations. Price is right and delivery was very fast. Hooking it up is really easy. Just follow the instructions about the line from the AV receiver to the subwoofer.
4,Nice sound when I added it to my Infinity Primus Three-way dual 6-1/2-Inch Floorstanding SpeakersReasonable price
4,Great amp for the money. Makes my bose  system in my 15x30  party barn rock
5,Professional Installer  Great Value.
2,Once set up found that the right Chanel is inop. Called Polk 5 times now and still have not been able to talk to anyone. But like othe reviews say. Nice product just pray there is nothing wrong with yours
5,Great powerful little sub with a great price.
4,Great price replaced my  12 year old sub which had failed internally. Works as advertised.
3,This sub woofer did the job in my tv room with surround sound.For the money it does the job.
5,Upgraded from an 8" Yamaha sub... night and day difference.  I am no audio junky but this sub for the price has awesome.  Not to thumpy and matches my JBL mains perfectly.
5,Awesome sub for my theater system. Great power and adjustability.
5,If your more into the quality of the sound than chest pumping bass then this sub is for you....now don't get me wrong this thing rocks and carries very well fills out a 20x20 room great
5,Bought this to go with a Denon AV Receiver.  Works great with a nice bass.  Very happy
4,fine. just fine.
5,I've owned several other sub woofers both active and passive and this outperforms all of them!
5,Amazing sound for the money very well worth it.
4,For the listing room space this unit work very well. I'm empress with the quality.
1,Purchased one of these subwoofers a couple years ago and it worked great.  Ordered a 2nd one as a gift and it was DOA.  The subwoofer would crackle at lower frequencies.  Reached out to customer service who tried to contact Polk but I was advised Polk was not available.  After wasting over an hour on trying to remedy the situation I will be returning the defective item.  Disappointed in Polk’s quality and Amazon’s customer service.
5,A great addition to my home theatre experience. Very good sound quality. When watching war and action movies it sounds like the explosions are happening in my tv room.
5,Wow!!! Under 100 bucks for this???!!! Unreal!! Base Sound is super loud.
5,For the money and absolutely excellent purchase. The sound was amazing
2,I bought this to replace my BIC sub that got left behind in my move.Doesn’t even come close to comparing it’s a rattle trap and sound quality is marginal at best. I should have sent it back.
5,For the money quite pleased to add to my system
5,Using this speaker on our houseboat. Works great!
5,Quality product great price...have mine sitting on a small stand...once I got it tuned in...definitely provides crisp sharp punch bass.  Highly recommend if you are on a budget.
5,Awesome sub.  I never thought such sound could come from such an inexpensive product.  I have mine in a room about 20x20 and the base punch is perfect.  Right on Polk.
4,Great sound.
5,I love it. Deep bass! For how much it costs and for what it sounds like it's unbelievable!
5,Great
5,This sub does really well for my apartment.  I like that it is forward facing and does not blast everything directly towards the neighbors below.  Definitely was worth grabbing.
5,I have two of these woofers in two separate systems with Magnepan speakers.
1,This thing barely made it 8 months before it started having issues. It's never been abused and doesn't get a tremendous amount of use outside of football Sunday marathons.Intermittently (while NOT being actively used) this thing will freak out and make a really loud humming noise. It has to be unplugged to get it to stop.Checked the order status on amazon. "Service window is closed" sooooooooo... I guess I'm screwed.I guess you get what you pay for eh?Update: 11/30/2020 - I'm replacing the subwoofer now. Super annoying.
5,Small but mighty.
1,Great external sub. Has the power to shake a house but even with the power set to about 30% it provides enough bass to improve my zvox 580 sound bar very well.Only con worth mentioning is the lack of a LFE input however there are instructions in the manual on how mimic having one. Thus this is not much of an issue.Bottom line is that this is one of the best sub woofers you can buy for the price. Would recommend.Update 01/20/2018:Subwoofer stopped working after 6 months of light use would not recommend.
5,I almost bought the more powerful version.  Glad I didn't.  This has more than enough power to make a great theater experience.
5,This purchase was money well spent. I bought one on sale over 10 years ago. I was amazed by the quality of sound and it is still going strong. I have a couple more subs 3 are considered "high end" units but still prefer the Polk for every day listening. I have it set up with a small cheapo tube amp and a oair of AudioEngine A5s connected by Bluetooth to a Fiio X5. The sound quality is awesome.
5,Encantado muy recomendable
4,Powerful 10" sub to supplement surround speakers. At this price point ($99) I couldn't be happier.
5,One smokin sub. Use it with 2 Bose 301's and a Harmon kardon3590  120 watt amp. The 100 watts is more than enough. Delivers floor vibrating crystal clear bass drum punch. I think I'll get another one.
5,Nice unit.  Amazon Warehouse discounted used unit works perfectly.  It was larger than I expected.
5,Awesome looking sub for 89 dollars great bass easy setup must buy
5,Awesome product
5,Sounds great fits behind our TV really easy to hook up. You should get one.
5,I love my powered sub!  It gives out amazing sound it is just what I needed for my surround sound movies sound fantastic and I love how my music sounds as well!
4,Very good sound at a great price. Only had this for a few weeks but so far it satisfies my need for bass.
5,I ordered two of them and I LOVE these subwoofers! They put out plenty of bass. They vibrate the walls so I wouldn't suggest these for an apartment...you might get an ugly note on your door!
5,TV surround sound
5,Alright I'm not an audio expert but this subwoofer turned my ordinary sound bar into an incredible sound "system".  Had it up and running and fine-tuned in 5 minutes.  Great value great sound!
5,Pretty good range and sound for a 10" and the price. The sound is crisp and clear low enough for beginners. The sound at lower frequencies gets lose a little bit. but overall is a perfect product for beginners!!
4,I paired my subwoofer with the Denon 1912. When in surround sound it gives a solid bass tone but not overdominating. In stereo it wasn't very evident but I may have misunderstood the hookup.
5,there's nothing worse than watching a good movie on your TV and not being able with you or the deep sounds that the subwoofers generate from that wonderful wonderful small box
5,Exactly as advertised and exactly what I needed.  Matched with my T50 towers great sound for about $300.00!
5,NICE....
5,great
5,Exaclty what I needed to crank up the bass.
5,This sub fills a room. My living room is some what large and the kitchen is somewhat connected and it fills that space as well. The Polk name speaks for it's self well done
5,sounds great; small enclosure and has alot of power for such an inexpensive product.i use mine to complement two in-wall speakers in my open kitchen/dining room and it fills out the low end very nicely.
5,Rocking bass from this subwoofer at a great price.
5,DAT bASS.  thanks to this sub my neighbor hates me that's when i realized how great this sub is.  i have it hooked up to my 5.1 home theater. no issues whatsoever.
5,This was on sale for less than half the retail price. It's not a top of the line subwoofer but as far as price to performance ration it's a real bargain.
5,Great sounding sub that creates rich deep bass.  Makes my music and movies sound great and feel awesome.
5,This sub is great! Rattles the house! The frequency settings are nice as well.  I have always purchased Yamaha home audio speakers and receivers... This is the exception and boy what an improvement.  Top notch-solid product.
5,Man this thing rocks out. Turned my house into a club. Very good sound and excellent bass. Watching movies with this is a blast. Highly recommend.
5,I bought one exactly like this a few years ago. Can't beat the price for this one.
4,This is a great subwoofer for the price.
2,I have a pair of KEF Q500 + Denon AVR-S920. This subwoofer hasn't improve my sound. Even made it a bit worse. It's just too boomy lack of details and no soft punch at midbass at all. I understand that price is low enough. So the bass quality. It shouldn't has 5 stars just because of cost.
5,Used this sub in an upgrade to my old sound system that had an unpowered sub. I kept the old Onkyo speakers but added the Polk Audio PSW10.  Totally changed the listening experience in the room.
5,I was a bit hesitant about purchasing this item at first but once I received it and set it up with our Sony speakers it was perfect great addition to our home entertainment set up.
5,Does the job! Good value for the money!
4,It is a great speaker. It was much bigger than I thought It would be therefore making it an wn better value.
5,I am very happy with the quality and sound of this equipment they work very nice on pinball machines I recommend this model to people that wish to improve the sound of there macines
5,Good
5,Sounds great. Provides all the low end I need for my small home setup. Surprisingly loud.
5,Great sub for the price.  There's a reason it has been on the market for so long.
4,Came quickly and as advertised. Works well. Needs a larger space as the dimensions are bigger than some. Be sure it will fit where you want to place it.
5,Amazing sound  great quality would highly recommend to anyone. Great buy you won't be disappointed!
5,sounds awesome.good for a average size house.
5,Good rich sound
5,Better than I expected.  I would have gone with the 12 inch but budget restaints I opted for the 10  inch. Awesome base. Flawless connection.
5,Excelente producto aunque es voluminoso
5,This is amazing subwoofer the bass sound is deep I love the way made my system sound my house shake every time I play some music like hip hop the bass is strong.
5,I love this thing it makes my home theater pop.  Deep rich base that is adjustable beyond what your home theater controls allow. The price is good and it looks nice.
4,good sound for the price! you cant play it supper loud though. great for watching movies at home
5,Clean bass for all music listening. Best boom for the buck!
5,First off I haven't been producing for long so it may not be fair to say but for me it does all that I expected for this price and more. Good starter speakers if nothing else.
5,Amazing value. Deep bass that is perfect for movies.
2,The sub woofer i received came none functioning out of the box; i thought it was a amplification problem at first but i plugged it into my B&K reference 7250 series 2 (amplifier) and nothing although the quality seems very nice compared to other sub woofers in this price range.
5,good extra UMPH for classical piano--didn't know what i was missing..
5,love it
5,Wow really makes everything sound so much better had to actually turn it down because it was shaking the windows too much.
4,Seems to work well.
5,Works great and does what it's supposed too!! Sound great
5,I love the sound of this speaker. Easy to hook up and I even bought another one to add to my system and it rocks out without having to have it cranked up.
5,Excellent sub for the price. Replaced one that the auto-on circuitry died. Every bit as good.
5,I have never owned a subwoofer before this one but I don't think you need to be an audiophile to know that this is a powerful sub that puts out good quality bass with volume to spare!
5,Sounds great nice looking subwoofer
5,Paired with a vizio soundbar and it sounds great. Highly recommend
5,Works and sounds well
5,Awesome speaker
5,Have this at the living room with my stereo system it blends very well under one of the tables at a corner it gives true depth to the sound very satisfied with the purchase.
5,Makes explosions and other low frequency noises come alive while watching movies!  Love it!
5,Great sound
5,Picked this sub up for $99 hooked it up to my existing system threw in Transformers bluray jumped to a fight scene and couldnt believe the rumble this thing put out so happy with it
5,I have 2 of these in my living room they sound great!
5,Great for the price
5,I didn't have a lot of space for a subwoofer but this baby does the trick. Rich deep bass from this 10" sub is amazing. Sounds like a much bigger speaker. Plus the price was right.
5,Beutiful for the price
3,This subwoofer is a good value for the price but it doesn't have good low frequency response and at high volume it sounds muddy
5,Great bass and easy setup. Very happy with it so far.
5,Great product - brought a deep base to my home theater system
5,So far so good a good sub for my apartment. great for my PlayStation. Thanks
5,Performs better than my Velodyne 300 watt Sub..it's a keeper
5,I was looking for a relatively inexpensive subwoofer to add to my surround sound system. This one was a great price works perfectly well for a basic surround sound system.  Good value.
5,Excellent quality good bass and a great price from Amazon.
5,This thing is great!!! I love it I just gave my son my old sub because I wanted a new 1 that was a higher wattage for my new system. Thanks Polk
5,Crisp bass nice cabinet great value!
5,This subwoofer is awesome. connected with Y RCA cable to a Belkin RCA sub cable to my vizio sound bar and it sounds awesome. Really good deep bass. pretty heavy. looks beautiful. great product.
3,Nice value but I like our similarly priced subwoofer that came with our soundbar better.
5,Great
4,Good sounding subwoofer at a great price!
5,Very nice subwoofer!!! Very well built nice clean look - and sounds great!!!  No buzzing no rattles - works perfect. And best of all. for the money you can't beat it!!
5,Perfect Subwoofer...Just what I needed to finish our system
5,Very nice sub. I use this with a denon m40 bookshelf system at work. It rocks. this sub  really makes music sound great.
5,By far the best bang for your buck.
1,this subwoofer did not meet any of my standards its sound quality was ok not good its frequency the same this sub is a terrible pick for someone who is looking for a loud low smooth bass this sub does not keep up with low beats it muffles the sound and the pusher doesn't keep up with the amp movie quality is horrible if ur looking for a movie theater feel do not buy this it only does well at very low volumes and u will most likely haft to replace it more then once it over all is a poor reference to polk audio you will not get enough for ur money u might as well get the psw505 its a lot better
4,This is a fairly large woofer - I would like it to be a little narrower and taller - at least for my application.  But great sound quality.
4,I got this for a friend hoping it wouldn't be as powerful as the current 12 inch Sony I have. It's every bit as powerful and bass quality is amazing
5,This subwoofer is great  especially for the price ( under $ 100 ).I like the bass adjustment  I can adjust it for a rich bass  Not that boom-boom sound. I'm a happy camper!!
5,This thing is a beast. Sounds great hooked up through an audio interface with the Mackie CR4s
3,Great sound for a casual listener or small to midsize room. It definitely has trouble hitting low notes and the sound of it bottoming out can't be ignored so I had to spend more money and go bigger.
5,Killer bass from this powered subwoofer.
2,This is nuthin specialmediocre subannoying booming is all you will here.I am am having buyers remorsethis is actually my first experience with this brand and i gotta tell you i'm not impress.
5,Well built excellent function stylish and a perfect complement to my system.I originally considered a 12" sub but after hearing this one I am extremely pleased with my selection.It'll bounce the furniture.
5,does what it is designed to do
5,This thing shakes the whole house.  I paid $103 but if you wait it will be $89.99 prime shipping.  Well worth the money.  Polk makes quality speakers.
5,Loud and proud. Very good for the price.  Great bass
5,Great sound for the money. Good looking unit. Highly Recomend !!!!!!!!!
5,Love the bass box
5,clear crisp bass for the money its the best
5,This product met my expectations especially when considering the price. I just wanted something that would help with the experience of watching DVD or Blue Ray movies...and this gets the job done...you can feel the rumble!
5,awesome sub. i have had it for over a year and play it 100% volume literally all of the time and it still bangs. it's a definite window shaker!
5,Works well with my Yamaha yas-107 soundbar.
5,Was bigger than I expected and has performed beyond expectations with my Vizio soundbar! It really completes the multi media sound package! For whaterver you're in to...movies live sports music and video games!
5,I'm using this sub for my surround channels and it is very good for that purpose. I would order again.
5,Great buy! I love it. Fills out the sonic landscape beautifully. Highly recommended!
5,Excellent bass for the money .
5,Satisfied customer.
5,I bought this and a pair of Polk Audio OWM3 On-wall speakers to replace the old set of another manufacturer and I have been very pleased with these speakers and you can't beat the price/value!
5,My old Sony sub gave up the ghost.  Did the research on Amazon and others and found this little gem.  No more buzzing sound during a quite moment in a movie!
5,i bought this sub-woofer after looking at several others icluding the sony and kliptsch. for the price this is a tremendous sub-woofer with deep base but not enough to shatter the windows.overall i would recomend this to anyone who has a decent receiver and is looking to complement their hd tv and ipod's.
5,Awesome sound for a surround sound system. If you want heavy good bass for music I suggest buying a 12 with more power!
5,Good I like it
5,Nice sub  !!
4,This is a great subwoofer at a great price. I was told about nthis subwoofer by a friend and I must say it has loived up to all my expecations
5,Shakes my house. Had to go around and tighten some screws and dampen some rattles so that I could maintain my desired volume.
4,Used for basement home theater and matched with Polk audio monitor 70's and sounds great.
5,No regrets this sub puts out amazingly deep bass!
5,Excellent sub.
3,Good solid bass from movies however the automatic shut-off sucks.  It stays on for about 2-5 minutes after you turn off the receiver and makes a loud buzzing noise.
5,Great sound
5,Perfect for my room and application and the price was unbeatable. It's easily 5 stars as long as the power supply lasts and it doesn't break like the Infiniti this is replacing did.
5,Agreed they are great for music and for TV shows and not house-shakers for the action movies.  But you will need to pay about 4 times as much to get something slightly better than this.
5,polk subwoofer works good in a small room sound good bass is ok for the price  wont bet any definitive subs that I have but its ok  for the price
3,Cheap worthless very short plastic bottom feet. 2 of the feet broke within a month after moving the sub twice.
5,It was a gift for my son and his wife. He literally loves it while I may not be on her good list. The sound quality and price were all exceptional
5,Absolutely bumps. It is unbelievable how loud this thing it. I love it so much.
5,I'm happy.
5,You simply cannot beat this for the money... awesome!
2,... given the amazing price but it just doesn't sound very good.  To my ears it sounds flat and weak and a bit cheap (even though the construction is really solid).  I'm looking to replace an 11 year old Denon DSW-37 sub with a 6.5" woofer.  The PSW10 doesn't even sound nearly as good as the DSW-37 so I'm returning the PSW10 and continuing my search.  As others have said the PSW10 is better than nothing but probably not a great choice if you are even remotely serious about your home theater/music sound quality.
5,Home
5,This subwoofer provides a perfect vibration to my living room.  It was so good that I bought a second one the day after using it for the first time.  I highly recommend this product.
5,produces nice sound for size. All that i needed.
5,It was a great addition to my yamaha stereo system great sound and at a good price
2,Replaced my old sub and went with PA to match my other speakers.  I'm actually quite disappointed with this purchase.  The sub does not turn on and off automatically; it will turn on ok but then fails to turn off.  After awhile you hear a hum coming from the unit so I have to remember to manually turn it on.
5,makes the house rattle !!!
5,Rattles the walls of the Dude Den. Easy on the wallet. Win win.
4,Sounds good with my klipsch surrounds that needed some bass for fill tones. If it were a 12" it would be even better.
5,I used this for DJ'ing there's a lot of thump in this small box and I receive a lot of great compliments with this.
3,The PSW10 is a very good sub-woofer.  I am not disappointed with the performance but it lacks the bang that I was looking for.  The room I have it in is large and open if I had an opportunity to trade up for the bigger sub-woofer I would. But it is a decent piece of equipment and for the price I can not complain.
5,Two words : Deep and Rich
3,A bit larger than I expected.  And one of feet broke off immediately. But sounds good.
5,THIS SPEAKER REALLY DOES THE JOB !
5,This thing is LOUD and if you put it in a small room... it's REALLY loud. Excellent quality. Highly recommended if you don't have 300 to drop on a better sub. Make sure to buy cable.
4,Great subwoofer everything works great but didnt come with any wires for hook up so had to buy some arrived on time.
5,A lot of power for a little guy.
5,Baddest!
5,My husband was looking for a speaker for his man cave. I purchased this in time for Christmas and he loves it. While it's likely a little bigger and stronger than we needed we're very pleased.
5,Clear bass and plenty of punch.
5,This is the second of 2 subs in my 7.2 system.  The 12" Polk in front this 10" on the back side.  I keep them both on #4.  Thanx for the great entertainment.
5,Loved the sound the stand by mode is great. I combined with bose virtually invisible speakers and the sound combined is the best I had heard.
5,The PSW10 works great for my application (15'x20' room) - lots of bass.The unit has a nice finish and looks great. I could not find a better value (quality for price).The only thing that would be nice would be a power-switch.
5,Just love this speaker. Lots of thump for the price.
5,You can't go wrongthe price the quality and sound .its pretty big for a 10.
4,For a sub woofer for the bedroom this one packs plenty of boom for the buck.  So far great quality and great value
5,Very happy with the purchase. Works well with my system shakes the house when it needs to.
5,Great product!
5,This has worked out well over the last 2 years plenty of low end. makes watching movies more interesting.
5,I now have two; great dealS
3,It doesn't suck but it doesn't bring as much bass as I was expecting it to. It definitely rounds out the bass for movie soundtracks but doesn't do much for most music. That said I'm glad I bought it. Makes movies much richer.
5,Everything
4,I wish there was a little more bass but it was good enough for the price.
4,Every thing is good only the size is still kind of big!  It list only 10"  so I thought very good once I got it wow the 10" I think it only measure the inside.
4,the sub is great but for my room size I had to buy the PSW505
5,Great
5,Great product extremely pleased with subwoofer
5,works great
5,This sub with a set of creative gigaWorks T40 seares II 2.0 Multimeda Speakers and U BE JAM IN !!!!!  Grate service and fast its all GOOD !
5,We never knew what we were missing without a bass speaker.  It really makes a difference in whatever we are watching or listening to at the time.
4,Wonderful subwoofer love it and recommend it.Polk people did a good job in designing this speaker.Thanks
5,it doesn't get any better than this for the price.  And it preformed so well - I purchased a second one for the Kids system.
1,This is  more of an amplified woofer than a SUB woofer. The cross over adjustment has a very small range and can not and will not enable tuning for an even slight tight bass response. The response is not tight and is more of a muddy response. This has a lot to do with the quality of the amp which is not fast or powerful enough. This is strictly about the sound and due to the very low price point is expected. If price is a main factor choose a smaller diameter driver and a more powerful amp and it may give you tighter response which is really what you will want.
5,Great product
5,Very solid sound that's adjustable to your room. A little on the large side but very solid sound.
5,the sound unbelievable
5,I purchased this sub on sale for $85 and I honestly believe that for the price you would be hard pressed to find anything out there of comparable quality and sound.
5,Love this bad boy. It can shake the neighborhood if you want it to.
5,This plus the matching center spealer  really perked up my older Cerwin Vega d-1's
5,Bought this to complete the man cave and WOW!  High quality for this price? Can't beat it! I'm no audiophile but when listening to music or watching movies this thing rocks!
2,Coming back after a few years and redoing my review. One sub started rattling the other is still working. FYI these subs can be a little boomy so the sound quality isn't great. Giving one exrtra star for the one sub that still works.
1,I'm putting this up for those who would like this.  I've had 2 of these now first one lasted just over 3 years second just over a year.  This is supposed to have a 3 year warrantee on it but good luck getting any support!  The 1 that is just over a year old will not turn on.  I've tried to contact Polk Audio for support 3 times in 2 weeks and have never gotten a response from them.  With that I would steer clear of Polk if you want a decent support experience.  Completely unacceptable!
5,Sounds great
5,Well built gets loud enough for my needs better then using those "stock" subs. Worth the price Polk is always good.
5,Nice product
5,Sounds great
4,I can't get the phase just right for all of my applications but it hits harder than my old 400w system and sounds clear even very loudly.
5,By far the best value for price quality and performance! Very happy with this purchase.
5,Has incredible sound and definitely worth the money.
4,this sub woofer is excellent for a smoall room like an apartment. It is loud enough for personal listening yet not too loud to your neighbors.
2,My purchase was to replace a Velodyne second sub in my home theater. Bad choice for this purpose. In combination with a Snell twin 15" primary sub all the Polk adds is a thumping sound that is not cinematic or musical in any way AND it does it from at least 150 hertz down with no real effective way to limit its output despite an alleged crossover and volume control. It's a fine sub for a small system looking to add some thud but buyer beware if your purchase is for music other that rap or movies.
5,price is perfect. works well so far.
5,Both affordable and great sound - really shakes the room from anywhere.  I love it!
5,it works well!
5,Pretty small price to pay for a pretty BIG sound.
4,This is working great good sound and reliable
5,Been good very happy with it!
5,I hooked it up to our samsung 46 inch tv and it really rumbles. Shakes the windows in our living room when watching video or tv. Great price. Should have bought it long time ago.
5,Excellent for home theatre surround sound!
5,Love this unit bigtime!
5,I actually go this to finish off my computer speaker setup and was looking for something small.  I couldn't find anything else at this level of quality for such a great price $85.
5,This Polk audio subwoofer has been a solid product.  For the price you pay this subwoofer has been more than effective for my home entertainment system.  Recommend to all.
4,Very good speaker for the price and to fit in with my other speakers.
5,great tight booming bass for 100 bucks the only think i did was remove the plastic feet and replaced with inch rubber feet so they stick to the hardwood. this was a no brainer
2,This is the second Polk PSW10 Sub Woofer that stopped working one year after purchase.With the first one I just threw it away since they are so cheap - but this time I will try customerservice just for laughs to see what kind of stupid run around I get. Not happy at all. Time to switchbrands and maybe spend a few more bucks. After all "you get what you pay for".
3,Can be more bass producing.  Did not like the twin input.
5,Good sound
5,Great bass adds more quality sound to existing Klipsch speakers
4,Hits hard and is quite clear. Please pick up and female-male splitter though! YOU WILL NEED ONE! It has an old L-R input.
4,Sounds good.
5,Love it. The price is great for the sound and the bass it puts out...
5,Great sound for an even better price. Would highly recommend this product to wake up your home theater.
3,Decent entry level sub. Great for apartments not so great for larger rooms unless pair with a 12 for deeper bass. Has a good punch factor though just dont expect it to rattle the walls.
3,Had to replace the Subwoofer for my Klipsch promedia computer system:>(  The Amp was shot too...  Once I got it all figured out this Polk unit seemed to work reasonably well.
5,guyslet me say this i purchased 4 of this Subwoofer from these guys and i am so happy with the item as you notice i when back again and again
5,Great subwoofer and using with Polk Audio TL150 Speakers and Denon AVRS510BT.No complains sounds Great.
5,Great addition to my home theater system. It packs a wallop. Great value for the price!
5,i love this subs it gets loud given that its only 10". packs quite a punch great deal for the price. looked around for a little bit before i decided to settle on these i am one happy customer.
1,Hooked up to a soundbar for game room. Sounded excellent used maybe weekly on weekends for gaming or movies.Amplifier screaming hot and fuzzy sound opened up and checked a fuse and it was good. I guess now it is a paperweight.... This is the second one i have purchased psw10 from 4 years ago still going strong and sounds great.Maybe a bad batch of something. The one that failed i ordered end of july 2018 died Nov 2018.
5,Good bass
5,Great product. Sounds great with good control adjustments on the back.
4,This sub does the job sounds great - we had been without for a while and were looking for something to go with our new receiver looks and sounds great very happy with our purchase and delivery was super fast!
5,Este bajo supero todas mis expectativas lo estoy utilizando en un sitio pequeño mas o menos de 10 X 10 metros cuadrados y suena muy bien! el empaque es excelente llego a Colombia sin ningún golpe.
1,I bought this because it had so many good reviews. I got it 3 days ago and hooked it up replacing a Sony 10 Inch Subthat took a surge and stopped working. I am 100% sorry I ordered this. I sent it back that day.  There is almost no low end bass. I could hearthe sub bottoming out. This is junk. It did not even come close to a 4 year old Sony 10 that I BEAT on every day. Dontwaste your money. Buy the PSW505 like I did for $100.00 more. That thing is a beast. Makes my brain shake.
3,Good Value not high end but gets the job done
4,Too big!!!
4,As soon as I hooked this up sound came to life.  Excellent lows and no distortion. Don't need to crank it up as the sound is loud.
5,Pisses off everyone in the house love it.
5,This little box is a monster!!!!! The boom fills the room!!!!
5,Great for size and price. I run 5.2 and 2 of them work nice together
5,Very loud and deep. Great product. I own two of them.
5,Well made and has audio adjustments on the back that actually work.
5,Super impressed with its sound ultimate value for money buy!!!
5,Exactly what I wanted complemented my surround system perfectly
5,Excellent
5,I love it.  It does everything I need it to do.  If I had to find something to change I would have made the volume a little more sensitive.
4,Good replacement tor my failed KH sounds quite good. I'm still fiddling to get it juuust right...
5,This is all you really need. The price is right quality is great and sound is good. I run it about 50% volume with crossover right in the middle of the range... sounds good.
4,I am still setting it up but I believe I am going to like it.Brotherb
4,came as described.
5,solid good quality atill running up to now 2018
5,Polk... great stuff all around. A nice compliment to my LSi 9s.  I've got plenty of thump now and enjoy watching movies at home!
5,Excellent subwoofer
4,This subwoofer the first one from the ps polk audio series is a great entry level sub.Even at moderate levels the room shakes very suprised what a 10 inch subwoofer can do.
5,Wow just wow.  Let the thunder roll!
5,This is a fantastic sub for a home theater.  Some people love their expensive sub's but don't waste your money especially if this is your first sub.
5,nice product good price Great sound
1,terrible quality. when the base gets a little loud it makes a very odd vibrating noise. it lasted 2 months and broke i threw it out. thanks for taking my money and sending me a garbage subwoofer. it appeard to be already used. maybe someone broke it and returned it i dont know. if you have problems right away. id say return it fast dont do what i did and wait too long before you cant return it. it was a l lot of money and i really just wanted it to work but it gradually got worse and by then it was too late.
5,Awesome
5,Bought this sub for my son.  His system sounds great and full now.
5,Great product and great price
5,Huge boom from a small box and at a small price
4,Rocks the living room.  I was surprised to hear the big bass from some a small package. I'd recommend to anyone.
5,Also bought this for friend. He said his home theater is now complete and woofer works great. He is extremely satisfied. Would recommend it to others.
5,Great sound
3,decent bass response any low end bass with above half the volume knob and distortion kicks in. Port noise also happens when low end bass is executed port noise does not sound good especially since it is louder than the bass at some times.
5,A great inexpensive woofer.
5,Filled in the missing guts of my Peavey system.I use it with a portable sound system for Praise and Worship at church in our fellowship hall.It made the portable system sound solid.
5,Nice little sub decent thump for the price.
5,This is my second one! Yes it's plenty for the average home theatre and more than enough in a tv den or family room. Nice controls.
5,Works as it should
5,I'm feeling things I've never felt before... But seriously AMAZING!
4,Great sound looks good outstanding value. Needed a replacement for my 15 year old JBL sub and found this on Amazon.com.
4,My first Polk purchase. Very happy with the power performance. Huge sound from a relatively small space. Rivals other 12" dual subs
4,Good subwoofer and a very reasonable price. When my friend heard the results after helping me hook up my sound system he bought the same one.
5,Excellent sub for the price
4,Inexpensive and nice sound.  It gives what is expected from a quality Polk product.
5,Wow!  Bought thru Woot for about $100.  Powerful and clean.  Rattles the house during movies and does not muddy up the low end.  Certainly a great buy!
3,I mostly use this sub with my PC and I don't think I would use it in a home theater setting. It's very boomy and muddy sounding. If you want punchy bass this is not the sub for you.
5,Very good sound
5,Great deal sub sounds wonderful. All I need
5,Lots of power and great for a second sub in your theater system!
5,For the price this is a great starter sub that has enhanced my TV movie and music experiences.
5,WORKS IN OUR MOVIE ROOM
5,It's powerful
4,Its what I hoped for . It does a good job.
5,Works Good. Looks great. Thx
5,very deep sounding bass
5,This added some much needed bottom end to my BIC Speakers. I drive them with a Harmon Kardan 3490 and it works just fine. Great value for the $100 ish range.
5,Great and powerful sound big boss...Wonderful subwoofer !
5,A great addition to my home audio/tv set-up. Super sound and very easy installation; moreover the PSW-10 is a high quality product very well made and is substantially better than I had expected.
5,It is way better tan what you might think by its power rating at 50w.  Strong deep bass many hooking options and a bold look on your room.Totally recommend it
5,For $100 you really can't go wrong.  Using this in my office with Audioengine A2+ speakers and it's perfect.  Much bang for buck with this one!
5,This thing bumps worth every penny...stop reading just buy it.
5,Super Sub. Couldn't ask for more. And what a priceGreat job Amazon
4,a fine wired bass fro my home surround sound system
5,This is an AWESOME sub-woofer.  We bought one for our upstairs and then promptly bought one for our downstairs!!!
5,This thing is pretty big but the sound it adds is massive and it's well worth the investment.
4,For the price its really nice.  But it's definitely an entry level subwoofer.  Not very impressive.
5,Great speaker for the money.
5,Nice looking and sounding.  Can't beat it for the price.
5,Incredible amount of power for the price.
5,Incredible sound for price easy to adjust to fit in with my old receiver/speakers.
5,Excellent sound. Deep thumping bass for a great price.  Perfect compliment to my home theater system.
5,nice and for good price
5,For the price good sub! I reccomend if you are on a budget
5,This has great bass and it's barely ½ volume!!
5,love it sounds great if you're on the fence just jump for it best deal you'll find on a decent sounding sub.
3,Good value for a small room. Performance equivalent with price. Would not buy again.
5,Small enough to not upset wife and I now have some Bass!
5,Buy this!!!!! Super loud and clear
4,This is a good medium price subwoofer bass unit. So far I have not had a problem with it yet.
5,Excellent sub. Plenty of power and distortion doesn't seem to be a problem for this thing. It hits the low end very well. Very clean sound. Easy to hook up. Well made if rather large. I didn't think it would be as big is it is. Looks nice. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
5,I wasn't expecting much out of a sub that i paid only 80 bucks for but this guy is a great bargain for anyone looking to drastically improve their sub on the cheap.
5,This was exactly what I wanted for my surround sound system....sounds great and a great price!
5,Works great I have wood floors on raised foundation you can feel the rumble throughout the house. I don't have destortion like so many people I know with systems with subs.
5,Well worth the $89 I spent on it to upgrade from a 5.1 setup to a 5.2.  For a cheap sub it does a good job.
3,Works fine but better subs are out there in this price range.  Parts Express has better subs for the money.
5,Unbelievable sound and very powerful.  Great buy.  I have had it for 1 1/2 years and everyone comments on the high quality sound it generates.
5,Great sound!!  Great price!!
5,This sub sounds great looks great and the price is a bargain! Don't forget the 'y' cable you'll need on the input cable if you use the RCA inputs on the sub - L&R.
5,Great
4,LOVE THE AMP FAST SERVICE
5,Great sound and excellent audio quality.  Really enjoy listening to the sound of the subwoofer.  For the price this is an excellent choice for anyone needing a lot more bass to complete their listening enjoyment.
5,Lots of bass for the buck. Really enjoying the Polk Audio line of speakers.
5,Excellent bass
5,Wow it rattles the pictures of my walls.  There is no rattling and it's athletically appealing.  Wish I would have got the cherry wood finish but either way.  Love it!
4,Great product now our house is a rockin!! Arrived in two days with Prime!
5,This sub sounds great nice low bass and lots of sound for the size. i am very pleased with it and would recommend it to friends. The price is set well for the quality
5,Dank slaps n beats n stuff yo
5,I got it as a wedding gift for my brother as his bit the dust. He freak'n LOVES it!!! This was a win win for all parties involved...
5,Awesome sound for an Awesome price. I just recently bought a 5 speaker surround setup and this sub was the perfect way to finish it off. I love my Polk sub.
5,this thing was just eargasmic. its beautiful and i waited months for this thing and it was well worth it it hits low and high bass and it just reverbs the room. its amazing.
5,Awesome sound
5,What a difference adding a sub to your system. They are technical aspects of it but I can say it feels good.The feature that auto turns on/off works perfectly.
5,This subwoofer is the best and the was great!
5,Received on time and in excellent condition. Sound is awesome would definitely recommend to others.
4,CAME OUT OF THE BOX EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED.WORKS WELL AND LOOKS GOODAT A PRICE MUCH LOWER THEN ONE WOULD EXPECT.AS USUSAL AMAZON MANAGED TO BE BOTH VERY REASONABLE ON PRICE AND VERY GOOD ON SERVICE AND DELV.POLK SUB WOOFER IS JUST AN ALL AROUND GREAT BUY
1,Not a good sub. Not a good amp. Tons of Port noise from day one. I'm honestly shocked that this is the most popular subwoofer on Amazon. It is cheaply made and it sounds like it too. I've owned it for a year and a half now and today it died. With no signal plugged it I get a LOUD humming sound just from plugging it into the wall. I plugged in the signal cable in the middle of a movie and got nothing but the infuriating hum. Buyer beware! Save your money and buy something actually well-built.
5,This thing rocks
5,Great sub with deep sounds wide range worked out of the box and still functions. Looks really nice too
5,Polk Audio this is a good sub
5,Incredible value.  I bought this for use with my computer speakers.  A bit of overkill.  Just a little volume gets the office window vibrating.  Love it.
5,Hooked it up.  Played the drum solo from Iron Butterfly - In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida through it cranked up.  Sounded wonderful.  It shook the walls.  Need I say more?
5,Great!
5,Great price and sounds excellent
5,I am using this in my production studio and the quality is simply amazing.  It delivers terrific low end and is easy to set up and dial in.
5,I have been in the market for a subwoofer for quite a while and after reviewing and following the prices this was the best value.  The sound so far has been outstanding and it fit in well with the rest of my Polk surround sound speakers in our media room.
5,This sub was easy to hook up and the sound has been awesome!  I like the size on this one.  It fits in the corner of out living room just right!
5,What happened to the $30 credit I was promised if I applied for an Amazon credit card?The incentive was prominent on the order form and I now have the credit card . . .Tom Leo
3,Reviews are over rating the sub. Very loud but too boomy not very crisp.
5,ROCKS THE HOUSE!Really good buy!
4,I bought 2 of these during black Friday for our great room. They sound great and were easy to install.
5,Great product
5,Super easy setup. Nice looking & Realy nice Deep bass & Cannot beat the price 👍🏻👌
5,It sounds great!
5,The setup was easy the sound was awesome and now my movies are as good as being at the theater.
5,Great bass very solid ! good price and fast shipping.polk has really good sound . it's from my home town too ! i will tell everyone i know about it.
4,For the price I am very impressed.
5,Very nice Sub-woofer. Looks/Sounds great and you can't go wrong for this price.
3,Its just OK do your self a favor.  If your room is 10'x12' or larger get the PSW 505.
5,For the money it's hard to beat. I paid $74 dollars for it on Amazon.
5,Great product sounds awesome! Shakes the whole apartment.
5,If you want a good but not crazy sub this is a great deal!!
5,The mainstay to my Polk surround sound system.  It rocks the house!  I have no dislikes of this or other 5 Polk speakers purchased separately to compliment  the Subwoofer.
5,It is an excellent product for the price paid.
5,This was everything I expected. I would recommend this product!
5,I bought as a present for my husband. He loves it and it has great sound. The package was packed beyond expectations. Nothing was going to happen to this package on the way.
3,This thing is not small. It big and puts out a lot of bass.
5,Great sound for the price!
5,Does a great job with my modest home theater center. Spending anymore money would have been a waste. Well worth it for anyone who is not needing pro quality.
5,good price
4,It's a bit underpowered but hard to beat for the price.
5,Love Polk audio gear subwoofer was a bonus to have with my Vizio soundbar!
5,The sub woofer performs very well and fills out the bottom of ny mix and match KLH surround sound speakers driven by a Mitsubishi tuner. Nice alternative the the much more expensive models.
5,Amazing subwoofer!!!!!
5,Made my home audio system completely awesome. Great music bass and room shaking movies.
5,Added this to two PA standing speakers. Love Polk audio.
5,Replaced a stereo/AV receiver with one that needed a powered subwoofer.  This Polk unit was just the item I needed.  The sound is awesome.  Great product for the price.
1,Bought this and a Pyle receiver to use as a shop radio. You have to turn the gain almost to nothing or the speaker pops and distorts like crazy. If the box hadn't gone out with the Christmas trash It would be returned for sure.
2,Amp died in 6 months of easy low volume listening.  Getting it replaced under warranty was pretty easy though. Otherwise I feel like its a pretty good deal.
4,I'm so much satisfied. The bass is so much soft in my ear.
5,This is one NICE subwoofer for the money
1,Now working again after twice taking the RCA plug out of the sub and plugging it back in. Not sure why that is but I'll hold onto it if it doesn't happen again.
5,The Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer is a medium but very powerful subwoofer which delivers an amazing sound experience in our theater room a must for a real theater experience.
5,sounds great
5,Wow this is just unbelievably amazing!!!!!
1,These subs sound fine for a small room however they randomly stop working.  The first one failed during the return period so I got a replacement... the second one failed in the same way... lasted a little over three months now I have a worthless wooden box and can't do anything about it.  Total waste of over a hundred bucks.
5,This is a good sounding sub that worked perfectly with my game room entertainment system. It's loud enough for a mid sized room and the sound quality is good for music movies and games.
3,Somewhat weak even for a 100w 10in sub.
5,Sounds awesome
5,Sounds amazing hooked to my Vizio 2.0 sound bar. Bass adjustment took a bit to get it dialed in correctly.
5,Better than I expected!!
5,Sounds great and produces more low end than my previous 8" sub.
4,Good for the money.
5,Fantastic sub for the price. Sounds Much bigger than it is this thing really rattles your molars.
5,Was more than I thought I would get in sound but price could not be beat
5,Sounds great very pleased thank you.
4,Only installed a couple of weeks ago. Appears to be working fine so far.
5,Excellent sound and simple set up
5,Excellent sound in a good looking package. Adjustable volume control makes it easy to customize sound to what is being watched. Very happy with it.
5,Well priced and performs to specs. Turns itself on when you turn on your amplifier.
5,I love the deal I got on this one. And the sound quality is perfect for me. I'm not an expert on subwoofers but seems like it works really well so no complaints.
5,great. works perfectly and sounds great. hard to beat for the money.
5,Great speaker for the money
5,Great sound. Lots of bass. No complaints on my end. Not sure why people claimed it stopped working. Sometimes people fidget with settings and don't know what they're doing
2,the sub sounds great but since day one it has had this annoying flutter that is very noticeable during explosions and other bass intensive scenes.
5,Just can't beat the sound and the functionality of this Sub.  High quality construction very solid and heavy.  Very tight bass and great customization for the sound you're looking for.
5,Very nice subwoofer and works and sounds great. Good adjust ability with rich deep sound output.
5,this is a great addition to a home theatre system -- very good for the price
5,Excelente
5,Easy setup sounds great
5,I have two with my Sony 7.2 4K system. Super sound was easy to fine tune for the room I set them up in.
5,I am not one that requires an earth shaking sub.  Just need something that helps make the movies more enjoyable.  This sub is great for my 15x15' room.  Great price.
5,Love it looks good
5,I moved into an older house that had some really good surround sound speakers with no subwoofer. I purchased this subwoofer and boy did it make a difference. Great sound. Great product.
5,Rocks the house
5,Great deep bass - I bought a second!
5,Purchased two of these love them sounds good shakes my whole house
5,This subwoofer is out of this world.  at less than half gain this thing shakes the house.  no distortion.  great buy.
5,Great amount of lows coming from this product. I got it for $70 and it's worth every penny. It fills up my whole room with all the dead space with great lows.
4,The performance and sound are very impressive the only dislike is I would like to have had an on/off switch for times when I don't want the bass. I can work around the problem. A very good buy for the price.
5,Nice bass!  Sounds great!  Love the adjustments that you can make on it.  Can really dial it in.  Great value.
5,Love it so far. Using this with 4x LU43PB speakers in my 500 sqft tasting room.
4,Solid subwoofer for a great price.  I do wish it had an LFE input but at this price it's just fine as is.
5,This product is well worth the price!!! Surprisingly even at a very high volume with the gain all the way up still hits without distortion.
5,It's Polk Audio. Nuf said.
5,This was my first sub and i was looking for something loud yet very accurate as well. I paired it with my two M-Audio BX5 D2's and the sound is perfect.
5,Just an awesome Subwoofer shakes my room and its nice clean deep bass you can feelOnce you have those knobs tuned just right its amazing best money I spent.Thanks Amazon !
5,Great sound
5,Be sure to turn the knob on back of speaker to lower setting unless you want an immediate visit from your neighbors. Even with low volume setting the subwoofer provides appropriate bass notes -- like James Earl Jones talking softly. Cabinet is beautiful.
5,We have an outdoor tropical terrace with outdoor speakers. Adding the subwoofer provides full rich sound to the system. Very pleased.
4,Well worth the money....
1,Worked great but died after 6 months when I contacted support they took a month and a half to get back to me then when they did they told to find a local electronics store to have it fixed.  Terrible customer service.
5,Not bad not bad at all! For the price it sounds pretty good. Adjustable bass level on this unit.
5,Works great. Rounds out and gives a fuller sound to my system.
5,Great sound.  Good value
5,We tested several sound bars before settling on just hooking this subwoofer up to our existing amplifier.  It was much less expensive and the sound beat everything else we had tried.
5,Excellent deep solid bass sound!
2,The sound quality degrades rapidly at 60% and higher volume from the back of the sub. I wouldn't trust it not to blow on anything above 50%.
5,Nice speaker for the price. I live in an apartment and find the subwoofer to be just the right size for sound while not disturbing the neighbors.
4,Good product.
5,Found this at another popular store for a lot more than I paid here and it is deffinateky worth the money. We used it at my wifes bithday party and it rocked.
5,Great Subwoofer for the price. Easy to install
5,I have a bose acoustimass set and the bass module kind of sucks. I bought this to get the bass I was missing and it works wonderfully.
5,Sub kicks great for desktop audio
5,Fantastic sound in a large rectangular room. Setup was easy design is nice. Well worth the price.
1,Stopped works ng after 2 years with very light use. Looks to be a power supply issue no warranty...
5,This subwoofer sounds amazing. I have it dialed in for my theater room and it is everything I could ask for. I love it!
5,Excellent sub.
2,This subwoofer it's a little underpowered in my opinion to much distortion even at half the power. Plus one of the legs literally crumbled - very cheap plastic used!I would not recommend buy something bigger or better quality for the size.
5,As advertised and expected. Very nice
5,Added this subwoofer to our second system with a pair of Polk bookshelf speakers we've had for over 30 years.  Sounds fantastic.  Recommended.
5,Very satisfied on this item. Sound super good in my house. Perfect for home theater sub mix with other brand sound bar. Feels like your inside movie theater.
5,Perfect for what I needed
5,Works great and a steal at this price.
5,I like it very good.
4,After trying some inexpensive base bought from local stores this Polk subwoofer is a very nice for my home theatre system.  I can hear the boomings every time.  I recommend this item to those who're looking for a nice sub but does not cost too much.
1,I’ve only had this product for a few months used it maybe 7-8 times max and I already get a rattling noise from it. I don’t turn it up super loud but I thought with all the good reviews it would be a good product.
5,Great sound for such a small box.
5,Easy setup and great sound! Relatively cheap and has high quality sound. Would definitely purchase from this brand again.
5,Great sub for the price.  It fits the rest of my surround sound perfectly.
4,This is a good subwoofer for a small room. Turn your amp's bass down to the lowest setting and set the Polk at 50%. No rumble and a big improvement to my TV and video experience.
5,I purchase one of these and after listening to it for about a month I purchase another to complete a 7.2 surround sound setup.  Definitely recommend!
5,For my basic 5.1 home theater needs this sub does the job really well. I live in a relatively small condo but this provides nice deep bass for an affordable price.
5,This Polk sub woofer is a great addition to my Home theater system movies and music both sound really good. Was a great price and was delivered on time. Would recommend to others.
4,Outstanding subwoofer sound great
5,Great subwoofer. Gives that nice 'boomy' effect to your music and movies without overwhelming you. Makes my bulldog sit upand take notice though!
4,Good buy for the price.  The bass is deep and clean.
5,sounds great i love polk
5,I purchased 2 of these for my home theater. So far they really pack a punch! You really hear the smooth bass and they fit in corners nicely.
5,It fits fine under my furniture. great design great subwoofer.
4,sounds good for the money
5,Paid $69 for this and I have no complaints with the performance. I haven't noticed the port noise I've read about in other reviews. A solid subwoofer.
5,It shakes the huose a tun
4,Looks good sounds good what more can I say I'll be the back bone of the Ceiling spaekers above with a new amp.
5,Solid bass great sound great price.  Has all the options on the controls.  Just be sure you get a well-rated cable to capture the richness.
5,Maybe its that this is my first home audio system but i think everything sounds amazing. i bought this sub mostly because of the brand recognition to polk and the price. i couldnt be happier with my purchase.
4,Got a little more bass than I expected  very good brand
5,Twice as good as I was expecting!!
4,For the price I think it's a great sub-woofer.
5,really sounds great
5,I can see why it is a best seller. Works great.
5,Very good sound.  High quality.
5,Works great.  Glad that we went ahead and purchased this.
5,Great bass for the price.
4,Very nice subwoofer. It does the trick for my stereo pleasure....
5,Clean sound over all
5,Good sound for the price...completed an incomplete system and allowed me to out away a larger set of speakers to free up some room and improve sound quality!
5,I got the sub a few weeks ago and it is amazing it has the perfect amount of bass to go into somebodies home theater system do buy it!!
4,It's a little muddy on the low end but still good bass from a sub-$100 subwoofer. Excellent value and nice looking unit!
5,Awesome sub for not that much.  Hits pretty low for a 10" decently loud and the cost... was only 60 bucks for the black one shipped.
4,I am not a big fan of booming bass when it comes to my musicand I already had a high power Kenwood sub for my LFE in moviesbut this sub was included free with a Polk purchase.I hooked it up and it seems to work just fine even at minimum settings.
5,Good sound. Great price.
5,I was thinking the bass wouldn't be that great from a 55 watt subwoofer but it  rocks the house and for the money it's pretty awesome.
5,It's great. Plugged right in to our existing surround sound and perfection.
5,This sub sounds amazing way more than the price.
3,Works well but doesn’t have a single subwoofer cable port
5,Great product. I've used this product for a year now. Feels like I'm in a theatre.
5,I love that it has the ability to go 180Hz or lower and it's suuuuuper easy to setup. And also the sound it produces very deep and rich lower frequencies.
5,This speaker is awesome!! I was skeptical at first but I'm glad I purchased this speaker. You can't go wrong with this speaker specially for $100 bucks.
5,Wired R150s through the PSW10 dialed in the crossover frequency and volume and the range of the R150s improved tremendously.
5,This subwoofer can be compared to a 12".  I have all the dials set to the middle and it enhances the sound of my entire system.
5,Really great bass in my home theater at an affordable price.  I'm not sure why anybody would purchase any other powered sub when they can have such a solid performer at such a reasonable price.
5,Great subwoofer! Provides plenty of bass. Easy to setup.
5,Low bass and solid sound. Thumps and the neighbors who come by are always impressed by the sound. For a C-note this thing can't be beat in a home audio setting.
5,Nice addition/replacement for my prior integrated system compact and full sound
5,Works great - very pleased.  Good quality well built.
5,I wasn't expecting much out of a 50 watt RMS amp but this sub is surprisingly efficient. For just over $100 its tough to beat it. I have it in a 10'x15' room and it has no problem pushing out enough sound for me.
5,Works Well. Great Bass
5,Bigger than I thought it would be but is very solid and well designed. The bass is just superb and rocks the room. For $99 this is a steal.
5,Product was as expected.
5,Great subwoofer especially for the price.  Sounds great highly recommended.
5,The polk 10inch sub sounds great. It is very clean and produces a decent amount of sound
5,WOW! This subwoofer is powerful!
4,Great buy for the price.
5,Fantastic.  Has the low end needed.  Can't say enough about Polk loved them since the 80s
5,I own 3.  I use two for the down stairs system and one for the upstairs.
5,This thing really SHAKES the house like seriously and that's a good thing.
5,I am pleased with my PSW10 Subwoofer from Polk Audio.  It adds a nice bass to my stereo music has to be toned back from maximum which creates a pleasant enhancement.
5,Nice sound.  Clear loud and no distortion. It's a bit bigger than I had thought but that really isn't a problem at all. I love it.
5,Great product solid look! Quality product! Sound quality great. Its a little bigger in size than I expected
5,For the money you can't beat it.
5,Very pleased! Better performance than expected. More adjustable than expected.
5,It kicks set it up for my annual family reunion. It brought out the music loud and clear. Beautiful sound.
5,Its a good product  especially for the price! have not gone wrong with Polk audio yet. Totally recommend if you are looking for an affordable subwoofer
5,Great deal! Great solid sounding sub for a small to medium size room.
4,You have to KEEP the Volume about half way up OVERALL ITS A GOOD SUB FOR 100 BUCKS... I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS..
5,Have to fill in 20 Characters. Amazing product for price. I have owned much more powerful subs in the past but this one is the most comprehensive
5,Help the sound system greatly
5,Wow - I love base and this sub-woofer does not disappoint!  Huge difference to my surround sound system.  Makes music sound awesome.  You can rock out with this puppy.  Well built and looks solid. Highly recommended.
1,I received the first sub and it wouldn't power up straight out of the packaging. I sent it back and promptly received its replacement. Less than 20 days later the second sub doesn't function and since its been 30 days past the original purchase the return policy has expired. All I can say is buyer beware! I've already ordered the 505 and planned on moving this unit to my secondary system. I hope the quality holds up for more than 30 days???
5,Great sub woofer....cranks out the bass that my neighbors love so well!
5,This little guys really rocks.  I recessed it into a media wall that I built and it sounds great.  You can not beat this little guy for the price.
5,Fast Shipping!! Great packaging! Quality Sound! Great fit & finish!  Highly recommend! Great bang for the buck! Want more bass for your system this is it!!
5,They work really well. I got them really fast.
5,For the money one of the best thumpers on the market. Thank you for great products Polk
5,This was just what I needed. I have a small Onkyo system and all that was missing was a quality subwoofer. This is just what the Dr ordered...
4,Very happy with the speaker. It has good sound quality at a budget price. Most importantly it actually sounds pretty good.
4,Is a definite improvement over my Polk Audio 8' SW
5,Love this subwoofer. It was very easy to hook up and sounds great. Movies come alive now with a realistic sound not just a big boom.
5,Great bass
5,Great sound and it is powerful
5,This Sub works great in our media room. Makes everything sound so much better. Great price! Going to get another for the living room entertainment system.
1,I heard this was a great speaker but mine was damaged when I received it but no worries the seller gave me a refund for the damaged device so hats off to them.
5,This is a great deal!
5,Compared to most subwoofer I have heard this is the best. It has deep rich bass. Built with quailty material. Recommened for music :-)and home entertainment.
5,Really good bass for the price. Got it refurbished for a really good price
5,I install Home Entertaimenment Systems and for my clients who want a subtle wubwoofer presence this is my choice.  Very impressed with Polk Audio products.
5,Great for any price not just for its price point!
4,best bang for your buck period
5,Absolutely what we needed. It was easy set up with our Sony home theater very little tweaking needed to get it to work.
3,It is just fine for a small apartment. But I realized that it has distortion for some genre of music and movie. But you get what you pay for.
5,This item works great.  I use this in our retail stores to boost the sound of our product video.  I would recommend this item.
5,Great subwoofer for $ 99.00
4,Sounds pretty good for the price
5,Great product especially for the price tag!!
5,The first one arrived damaged however the replacement works wonderfully.
5,Bass is exceptional and it matches the rest of the entertainment center perfectly.

5,Great Subwoofer  Adds the extra punch when listing to audio.  No damaged in shipping
5,Good solid sound.
5,Very good sound for the money.
5,Very good subwoofer. Easy to install and instructions are clear to operate
4,Great performance from a budget priced sub woofer. Delivers plenty of punch without adding distortion. It is well worth the money!
5,bought this for my boyfriend he wanted an 8" but I found this for 150.00 cheaper than the 8" and we bought it. works great
5,Hey this Polk Audio subwoofer really kicks. It looks awesome as well. I'm really enjoying the deep base sound it produces. I would definitely buy again.
5,Great product great price...
5,This was a replacement for my damaged PSW10 which worked like a champ!
4,Quality subwoofer for great price.  Bigger than anticipated.
5,For the money this subwoofer does more than enough if you are putting together a home theater
5,The Polk Audio PSW10 Subwoofer was more than I had bargained on..It makes listening to music and movies a whole new experience.  It was a great value for the dollar.
5,sounds and looks great well constructed. Options for hook-up. Like the adjustment for frequency range and volume.
1,i love polk speeks! this sub and Polks customer service is non exzistant!! grant it it was less than my chery woods by far! but c'mon Polk sell something that works! heading in the Infinity or Advent direction! you never answer crap until warranty runs out!! HELLO 2 years later
5,so so so very happy sounds great with my kanto yumis
4,good price and seems to be holding up well.  I would buy again for the sale price for under 100
5,Sounds great. No problems. Great price.
5,We use it on Classical and Jazz so it gets a broad spectrum of base line. punchy and does not over saturate like some of the cheapies out there.
4,sounds good but it has too much power for the speaker
5,My husband likes this very much. Now we can listen to all our old rock and get all the bass we want. Great buy for the money.
5,Had no problems. Works fine in my home theatre system.
5,Thumps good enough for me for music and movies. I like the volume adjust on it and the also the auto on and off switch.
5,works great.  great sound.
4,The PSW10 gives me great bass for my system!
5,Excellent sub woofer.
5,Bought two of these for my 7.2 setup... My house rumbles! Best addition to my surround sound. Scary movies are even scarier now!
5,Shakes my dorm room...and the rest of the dorm.
4,This is a really good item reasonably priced purchased from a great vendor.
4,I wasnt sure what to expect when buying an 89 dollar subwoofer but for my small living room it sounds great.
4,The PSW10 is everything I had hoped for in an inexpensive subwoofer.......it sounds great...... nice bass tone......all for under $100.
5,big and loudYou must get a sub cable with left and right plugins to the sub and single plug for anp/receiver.
4,good value for money. Easy to setup.
2,Really muddy bass that is terrible for listening to music. I figured with all the great reviews that this would be a great addition to my setup but I guess not. I will be returning this and plan on buying the Pioneer SW-8MK2 instead.
3,Kinda cheap and not very powerful I'd recommend waiting for a sale on the psw-505.
5,Perfect Bass for our living room.
5,Great speaker for the price
5,Came well packaged. It was easy to hook up and makes rumbling bass noises as intended. I'm not an audiophile but it sounds good to me even at low volume.
5,Good product! As described. Fast shipper.
3,The bass isn't that clear but it's all right.  With enough tweaking it's fine.
5,I ordered 1 hooked up to new system and bass sounds great.  I ordered 2nd one to add to system waiting for it can't wait.
5,Love the low frequency bass and the power this subwoofer has. It's the best one I've used.
5,great
5,Seems to do the job for my entertainment system.
1,For the hour that this product worked I loved it...Unfortunately I received a defective product that caused me to purchase an additional $40 worth of items (ground isolation shielding etc) before finding out my product didn't work.I've returned this product after reading all the posts on forums about this product.
5,i love this product i already had 1 but with 2 it is perfect my home audio system sounds like a car
5,This is a awesome Sub. I have purchased 4 of them. Great lows and solid constraction.
5,Just what I was looking for. Works great!
5,Great power when needed crisp clear bass easy setup . Using with Yamaha RX-V375  very happy with this subwoofer . You won't be disappointed .
5,I'm not an audio expert but I think this is a great sub for the price. Took my system to another level.
2,The speaker in the off or auto position with no input signal will consume 8 Watts.  10 Watts is used if in the on position with no signal. I think Polk can do better.
5,For this price point amazing bass.  I'm no audiophile just wanted a little extra oomph on grenade blasts when playing Xbox.  Done and done.
5,Got two of these in a 5.2.2 atmos setup.  They sound great  and deliver booming lows.
5,This thing POUNDS
5,Easy plug and play and it worked great with my Yamaha receiver.
1,Unit would not power up when it arrived.Looked online for solutions...seemed the second most likely solution (to returning it) was to replace the fuse.Guess what?You have to remove the back of the unit and hunt around in the internal components to simply check the fuse.Returning this defective piece of junk now.Very disappointed.
5,This is a very good entry level subwoofer. You get some real nice lows with this. Highly recommended for any novice living room theatre set up.
5,Great sub sounds even better after a slight burn in period. It can fill a small to medium sized room with low frequencies very effectively.
5,A nice upgrade from my old non-powered woofer. Connected to my Sony amplifier it works great. Plenty of power for most setups. Probably won't please an audiophile.
5,deep bass can feel it love the volume control  It has a left and right input so used the right one works fine that way.
5,Great quality and sound for the price
5,Impressing solid base sound from this small 10" subwoofer with adjustment knobs to match different applications.I'm totally happy with the purchase !-Joe
3,It's OK has trouble at certain frequencies but do you expect for the price.
5,Very pleased with this purchase. I got this for my husband and he is very happy with it. Awesome sound and looks nice.I would recommend this product to others.
5,Great product
5,This thing can definitely thump. My living room is about 20x15 and it is plenty adequate paired up with my Yamaha sound bar for both music and movies.
4,The performance is ok!!
5,Delivers a lot of low end bass for the money.  Can't go wrong.
5,Great subwoofer
5,Works greatI had to turn it down a bit.
4,Good for a small area.Controls are adaquite and simple.
5,Great product has really nice bass and looks great. Quality is top notch!
5,A turntable mini-amp bookshelf speakers and this beast. Simple setup incredible sound. Love this thing.
5,Great product. Works as described.
5,Best sub I've owned so far. Read CNET reviews - this is a keeper.Two separate inputs LR but my Onkyo receiver only has one sub output. Just plug into one channel - splitter will not do you any good.GREAT sub! Good looking wood too.
5,for this price and size  it is hard to beat t6he polk audio line. great sound for this price range.
5,The bass enriched the sound and was more than enough to fill the 12 x 15 room it is used in.
4,Nice Bottom But No Directions on how to operate.
5,Wow what a difference in sound with this guy my home theater for me Polk is the best for the price
5,Worth every penny!
5,Good sturdy and efficient subwoofer especially for the price
5,A lot of subwoofer for your money best value on the market today.  I'm using it for my 5.1 surround system for my TV.
5,For the price this sub cannot be beat. Sounds excellent! It's only 50 watts I cant even imagine what 500 watts would sound like in one of these units.
5,This sub woofer is AWESOME . It fills the whole house with base. I would buy this one again and again.
5,Best sound purchase I ever made. Can't beat the price/performance ratio. Sounds better than subs 4X as expensive.
5,Bang for the buck!
5,Good deal. Sounds good
3,I thought this would have a little more power to it.  I have it in my living room and it sounds great but does not put out as much power as the description has it does.
4,Don't turn it up to loud.
5,excellent sound for a low cost.  Arrived in a few days.  Very happy so far!
1,Maybe i was spoiled with a far superior Acoustic Research 12 inch sub in my previous life but this Polk has no power.  i have it at max volume and it is barely going.  Yes it does work and adds "some" flair to the bass but in the rare occasion i am looking for some wall pounding this is far from what I was looking for.
5,this sub is great for the $ for the $ you cant beat it.i highly recommend getting it.it has awesome lows!! cant go wrong with polk audio!! plus free shipping on amazon!
5,Great bass for a cheap price. I bought this expecting something that gave my soundbar a little more intensity this thing have me that and more
5,Had good bass
5,Sounds Great! Lows are deep
4,Works well for the money.
5,Under 40hz it begins to lose presence but still is really great.
5,Works absolutely amazing for even twice the price!
5,GREAT VALUE AND GREAT PREFORMANCE......

5,This is a great sub for the price.
5,Best economy sub

5,Wow! What a Boomer love it
5,Probably the best bang for the buck -- good quality and decent bass for casual listening.
5,We needed a small subwoofer because our previous one blew out. So far so good with this one. This small subwoofer is great for small living quarters.
5,Good bass hooked right up to my vizio sound bar. a Great Edition to my home audio system.
5,Great sound quality very well assembled and very easy to set up!!!
5,For under a $100 this is the sub woofer you want.I'm not an audophile but I think the quality is there.
5,Fantastic quality. Well worth the price. Fast Shipping.
5,puts out plenty of Boom for my 20 x 20 room.
4,Product as described.  Great transaction!
5,Best sub woofer I ever had. My previous Sony quit on me. Sounds solid. Would definitely buy again.
5,Sounds great!!!
1,Subwoofer comes on at any given time when receiver is not onOn off and standby poorly marked.  On and standby don't do itOnly way to use it is to turn on and off manually. Come on PolkAll other Polk speakers are greatAWAITING advisement from POLK Audio
5,Love the above average sound for the price.  Thank you for a great product!
3,If your on a tight budget and need a Subwoofer for your home stereo then this is a great buy. It is a little muddy and with only 50w its not crazy loud but for the price it's hard to beat.
5,Great subwoofer.just plug and play.It is so strong that shakes my media room.Best part: Cheaper than any competitor for the size an power.
5,Just what i was looking for. Great quality fast shipment loud rumbles during movies and hard hits during music playing.
5,Awesome sound!
5,Great product for the price. Works great
5,Great
5,This Sub took my system to another level..
5,Great item would recommend. Great price and great sound. Love it! No complaints at all. I think I will order another for the garage.
5,I would strongly recommend this for a decently priced clean hitting sub. wonderful product and superb quality for the price. The only con: I wish the amplifier had a little more balls.
5,Yes is a great subwoofer!
4,The Polk PSW10 matches nicely with our RTI600's..and our polk Csi245 center speaker.  I'm really happy with the sound.  Honestly for 50 Watts I wasnt expecting too much...but the bass will rattle the pictures off the walls :)  You wont be dissapointed in this speaker.
5,Great subwoofer for the price and great sound for my taste! I recommend it to anyone who wants a good subwoofer for a mid-size room!
5,Very good bass I would recommend it highly
5,I love this product and will get another in the future and set it up as a dual subwoofer. For the price you will probably not get anything nicer.
5,Sounds awesome.  Can't wven turn it up halfway while playing music.  Rattles my whole apartment.
5,Awesome awesome awesome.Looks great and sounds better. It is EXTREMELY loud. Great deep bass and for the price tough to beat.

5,high quality
5,Exactly as advertised! Works great! Perfect fit for my pinball machine! Sounds awesome!! Looks nice and can be adjusted to meet your audio preferences.
5,Great sounding subwoofer! Exactly what I needed!
5,Shipping was prompt.  Installation was a breeze and sound quality great.  Sounds as good as subwoofers that cost twice as much.
4,Gift for my wife and she loves it.
2,After setting up the PSW10 with my receiver I put it through some Blu-ray movies that have all ranges of bass.  The sound wasn't too bad until you get into some pounding deep bass.. (i.e. thunder)  The ported encloser makes the grill rattle and the tones of bass out of range sound aweful.  The sound is hard to describe but really kills the dynamic of the movie.  If the bass stays within rage the speaker sounds pretty good..  Overall I'd suggest getting the sealed enclosure to bypass the grill rattling and garbled low tones..
5,Great sound just what I was looking for
5,One year later no problems.  Have it in my living room and it sounds great.
5,Bought this to replace an 8-inch Polk sub and I love it. It produces excellent tones at all volumes whether used for movies or music.
5,Great subwoofer with plenty of power. My husband and I were surprised with the quality considering how inexpensive it was.
4,Decent bass sound for an economical price !
5,WOW!  The Amazing new world of a sub!  NEVER had a clue it could change sound so much!
5,This unit sounds great especially for the low price. I was able to hook these up with my M-Audio AV-40's and it sound fantastic.
1,I bought this because of some nice review and cheap price.  I am a more demanding person maybe but this subwoofer is really not up to par per my standard.  It sits in my listening room as a "dead-weight" more or less.  I will be happy to sell it to anyone for 50% off my original cost only if you are in SoCal area NOT going to ship anywhere.  Almost like brand new.
1,All I get is a loud bass hum.  Customer service so far a zero.  Because of Covid I waited too long to return through Amazon.  Bought to replace an existing subwoofer so I know my cord sends signal from receiver but besides the annoying hum - nothing.
1,I bought this subwoofer only 8 months ago and it stopped working. It's get's power as the light is on but no sound. I pulled the jacks out of the back and went to plug them back in while the power is on which should cause feedback but there is nothing. Prior to this happening the sound was excellent for the price point.
5,Beautiful addition to my home theater setup. This will definitely rattle the walls.
3,Can't be crossed over below 80Hz so not the best option for use with full range floorstanding speakers.  With smaller bookshelves etc. it works well...probably too big & loud for near-field or personal listening applications.
5,Excellent product for the money...would definitely purchase again. Using this with an abus system and it really brings out the bottom for heightened listening pleasure. Highly recommend...Thanks!
5,Great little sub. Using it with a computer running through a home audio reciver. Not going to shake the house off it's foundation but what do you expect for less than $100.00.
5,speaker is amazing; grill cloth not so cat-proof.  Put a black mesh grill on it and rock n roll
5,Love this Sub.  Finally I have some good bass.
5,It's been a while since updating my audio components and this had me smiling from ear to ear.
5,great
5,Great Subwoofer... very good sound easy to hook .... Great Subwoofer... very good sound easy to hook. I would buy it again!
4,So far so good. My wife likes it.
5,love this
5,Great Polk Quality as usual; combined with an excellent price make this a homerun hit.
5,It filled in the low frequency sound my system was lacking for watching movies perfectly! I would recommend this subwoofer to anybody improving a basic stereo sound system.
1,This speaker sounds great for the price but the amplifier has failed twice within a year. The speaker doesn't even get used on a daily basis. Very frustrating.
5,I love the sound this sub-woofer produces.
5,Looks great.  Great value for a Black Friday deal.
5,Polk just the bomb as always
5,Great sound & price!

5,Very good sound quality and features.  Works very well with my Yamaha receiver.  The overall bass and sound quality is much better than my 8" Yamaha sub woofer.  So far I am really liking this product.
4,Good bass that might not get you evicted.

5,In my Polk setup this thing handles the bass well if not over powering.  Think I'm gonna buy a second when it goes on sale again.

5,tight sound for a small sub great when using in a 3 piece set up. using with some polk book shelf speakers in a office.Sounds awesome!!!

5,Good bass good value
5,Does what it should - sounds great. As usual packaging and shipping were excellent.
5,exceeds what I assumed.. just enough Thump to fill and complete my system.. I would recommend . I wish I could bridge my other to this one..

5,perfect sound plenty of bass for price. no need for a 12 incher. nice punch and mids are complemented
2,It is highly directional and if I am not straight on in front of it I cannot hear the deep base nearly as well.  My BA subwoofer in my other room that directs the base downward seems to fill the room with base and it is 2" smaller in size while the room is much larger.
5,Great bassawesome price!

5,Total steal emmersive sound.
5,Great sound great base and good quality for the money.  This type of a deal is very hard to find these days.

5,Purchased this sub with onkyo receiver and it sounds great. When you are watching a movie this sub produces great sound. I would recommend.
5,Great price for a 10 inch sub...enhanced my surround sound speakers. Now movie sound quality is like theater speakers.
5,this sub is awesome!The best thing about this product is that it is amplified and front fireing so you don't just hear the baseyou feel it!
5,This sub was perfect for my basement! It's hooked up to my Vizio soundbar and gives me a theater feel when watching movies!
5,Perfect
5,Went without a sub-woofer for almost a year. Great product. Sounds great looks good in our living room. Hooked up easy matched well with new Pioneer receiver.
3,kind of big make sure you have lots of room good value
5,Great for the price.  Does the job nicely.  Not to much; not too little.  I would absolutely buy it again.
5,replacement for old subwoofter works and sounds great
5,I love my subwoofer so much power it sounds like a 15" and it powerful I learned the best deal are on Amazon.
5,Fantastic sound quality. Movie night would not be the same without it.
5,good
5,I chose this subwoofer as BIC speakers have been great performance and great value products for as long as I can remember.  I have not been disappointed so far!!!
5,Great subwoofer with lots of power and great sound. We have it hooked up to a sound bar and it sounds like you are in a theater.
5,Perfectly loud for a medium sized living room.
5,Great bass
5,Great value. A bit muggybut that's in comparison to my Definitive Technology speakers that cost over twice as much.
5,Allot of bass for the size box it is in.
5,I purchased two of these.  The base is better than expected and they are very easy to set up.  I have been using these subs for over 6 months.
5,I'm satisfied
2,Not good
5,great product works great
3,Does not accep to much The bases IT begin to saturate and The noise is no so good AT that momento. For The rest IT is a good subwoofer AT a very good price. It works just fine.
5,Have put this sub to the test and it has been great! Good for a 20 x 25 room.  However my roommate hates it !
5,Nice controlled base i use them all day cranked no issue
3,For the price it's a good not great driver.
5,Can't be beat for anywhere close to the price.
5,For $69.99 I thought I couldn't go wrong and it had exceeded my expectations beyond belief! Great sound out of a small sub.
5,I added this sub to the rear surround along with the RM7 satellite speakers. They made a nice addition too the system.
4,Great
4,Easy setup and very powerful.
5,Wow! just perfect - not overpowering and easy to configure.
5,I use this my shop with some Klipsch computer speakers someone gave me.  It was a steal at $99.
4,a very good bargain
5,This speaker is very powerful it gets the job done that is for sure! It was priced great and will consider more polk audio in the future.
4,I bought this sub to compliment my polk audio soundbar. I have to say they both compliment each other. Polk Audio offers some great products for home theater at a reasonable price.
5,For having only 50 watts this speakers carries a whole bunch of bottom.
5,Heavy well built sub.  Can't use at full power or I'd blow out some windows. Powered with Denon AV unit.
5,Excellent
5,Very simple to connect to my A/V receiver and home theater system. Sounds really good for an inexpensive subwoofer. Is somewhat heavier than I expected.
5,Great Sub.. well worth the money
3,Not bad for the price. This wont vibrate your seat in a decent sized living room. However the bass is decent enough to know you have a little power while watching movies or jamming to music. Good intro woofer
1,bass on this was not clear or enjoyable.  not a great accessory to high quality system in my opinion. If you just want something loud it would be ok.  Even in my party days the beat from this would have been a bit to much/obnoxious sounding
5,This bass subwoofer works great with my system. It sounds great and would recommend it to others. I would buy it again.
5,Bought to replace an Onkyo sub woofer that had died. Sounds Awesome!
5,Love it great product from Polk Audio like always
5,After a number of years later I'm still using this Sub.............really solid product.
5,Its a good sub it has good sound quality it fits perfectly were I want it and it was a good deal
5,This is the third that I have bought.  Great performance at a very reasonable price point.
3,Thanks
5,works great. cant see how you would need any more. 20x50 room
1,This subwoofer worked fine for 17 months and then died.  Will not power on.  Opened up the back to check the fuse.  Fuse is still good.
5,So far so good.  No issues.
5,Fantastic bass
3,Average.
4,Sounds Great!!
5,Great
5,This sub is no ordinary subwoofer. its a monitor series therefor it bumbs like a charm...amazing sound quality shakes my house like crazy. truly an amazing sub!
5,Great sound for my system
4,good value for the price
5,This is my first sub for my basic 2 speaker 80w amp and this sub just makes the sound right It's the perfect setup for music movies whatever have you its awesome.
1,Don't waste your money if buying to listen to music. Thing is a rattle trap and have to turn up max to get good output. My JBL blows this thing out of the water.
5,Ohhhh Yess!!! love the sound was waiting for this long time $79 is not bad for this item
5,After reading the reviews i decided to buy... like one reviewer said awesome sound for the price and i agree. Great sound
5,Works and sound awesome.  Great value for the buck...
5,all I can say is big boom
5,A solid performer for the price.
5,so much bass it rattles the walls.

5,My son suggested this unit to replace the aged Bose subwoofer.  I could tell the difference right away.  The system really performs now!
5,Love the sound!! Great size.
5,Great product price and value.  Very pleased with every aspect of this unit

1,I ordered this sub based on the reviews i saw but from my experience this sub performed terribly it just gave a rattling sound just above half level so i returned it. The pioneer sw-8 sub by Andrew jones is the much better sub i bought three of those and i absolutely love them i am about to order a fourth one.
5,Purchased March 2009. Sounds great November 2016.
5,Granted I know nothing at all about sound systems. I love it its perfect for me. Matches my other speakers and Is nice and loud
5,for a hundred bucks you can't go wrong.
5,Great so far. Decent sub for the price!
5,Replaced my Bose subwoofer with this one from Polk. You could not tell the difference. Great price small enough to fit in my closet.
5,This replaced a larger Sub from another manufacturer.It blows it away.The installation was easy and the sound is awesome.I am well pleased with this Subwoofer.
5,Best bang for your buck
5,We bought this subwoofer for are TV. It has great sound. Worth the money. Went to a big box stores and they wanted 200.00 dollars for this same Polk Audio Subwoofer.

5,Best subwoofer for the money thats out there.I would reccomend it to anyone that wants a great sound
5,I've never owned a subwoofer but I love the bass. Not overpowering.
5,I got this nice sub for around $69 bucks! its definitely loud i love the way the bass hit my chest!!;-)
5,This speaker is fantastic and sounds like a much bigger unit.
5,Great bass from these especially in action packed films.
1,This sub seemed like a good deal but blew the fuse the moment it was plugged in. There after I blew 3 2amp 250v fuses immediately following. Was going to return it but missed the 14 day return label/barcode amazon gave me. Garbage. Literally.
5,Produces all the low base I need.  At only one half volume it rattles the pictures on the wall.  I use it at one third volume.  If you need more base than this get 2 of them.
5,Sounds incredible.  Much better than my older sub.
5,This is a great product that sounds amazing with my new Sony receiver that makes the room shake. Helps if you have a small room
