5,So for the remanufactured ink cartridge is working great in my copier.  Print quality good and bold and the value - super!  Half the price of new ones.  I haven't had it long enough to know the longevity so I didn't rate it but I'm expecting it to last just as long as a new one.  Will have to let you know later.
5,We use for our family HP inkjet.  These cartridges are recognized by the printer and work well with no problems.  Much better price than OEM and I do not notice a quality difference.  Great alternative ink cartridge to HP!
5,I have used this ink before and had very good luck with it that is why I bought it again!
5,Cheap price for printer ink but it is expensive when it will not work with your printer. I purchased this in the past and both cartridges worked. This time when I ordered them I did not try to install them until the return window had already passed. This time my printer will not operate with these cartridges. Any one needs an expensive paper weight take your chances and roll the dice. I will never buy again!!!!
5,Seem to work well
5,So far so good.
5,Spot On.
3,We bought this product a few months ago. My previous black ink went out first so I replaced with the black cartridge. It works very well. Nice print. I replaced the color cartridge recently. The printer did not recognize it and keep printing black and white color.
5,I’ve been using these for quite a while no problems. Highly recommended.
5,it works! easy to install. no problems
4,Printer
5,Just as good as Jp ink ! Love it. Works perfect.
5,Price
4,Looks exactly like Original and went in the same and print quality is fine.
2,I bought the set of cartridges (black / color). Black ink works great no problem. Opened the color cartridge today and the printer couldn’t read the chip attached to it. I tried several different times to install but it wouldn’t work. How do I get a replacement from the company?
5,Excellent Quality Last a long Time and the Price is Right !
3,Just installed these into my printer printed 30 colored prints.  1-24 are perfect however page 25 is half purple and 26-30 got no color but purple.  Did a reprint of page 1 and it is purple.  Clearly 24 colored prints from a new cartridge is money wasted.
3,Black worked but the printer would not accept the color cartridge
5,Good product for the price.
2,At first these cartridges were printing well. Then all of a sudden the paper came out halfway and the printer said the print needed time to dry. What! Then the paper goes back in for a couple seconds and then comes out! It comes out on two sides! It's just a mess!I would not recommend.
4,These ink cartridges are a very simple installation. I have ordered them on three different occasions and im ok with the overall. The ink life I will begin to pay more attention to. Seems short the last couple of times. The ink quality I will also look at more closely. I have noticed that it prints darker than expected. I mostly use on on heat transfer paper for making tshirts so other variables are in play (like the paper itself). I will continue to purchase this product.
5,Just received this product. New brand for me. Print quality is pristine. Arrival time was 2 days. Longevity is yet to be determined as I have only printed 2 pages.
4,Not sure if longevity but the print colors are good
5,It was easy to install and print.
5,It fit my printer and worked really well.
5,Got really tired of paying premium prices for HP cartridges that didn't last long.  At less that half the price of HP cartridges I figured WTH I wouldn't be losing that much money if they didn't work.  Well they worked and they worked better than expected.  Easy install recognized and set for my HP printer.  Never again HP as long as I can get FAcms cartridges.
5,Really good ink. Great price fast delivery. Great seller.
4,They worked out of the box. I hope they will last.
5,Great product I will purchase again. I like to keep a back-up of ink for my printer. Great price!
5,I copy quite a bit and was looking for a way to save. I looked on line extensively and  landed on this one due to reviews and description. Not disappointed so far can’t comment on longevity yet. Easy to load accepted by HP 5200 printer with no issue. Print quality is excellent.
5,I tried hp ink for awhile. It seemed like such a great deal! But I had a few problems pop up with cartridges not working and always when it was an important item needing printed - like for the irs.These work great. I haven’t had any problems whatsoever and thankfully if one suddenly dies I can order another and have it in one to two days. Sure HP ink seems cheap but dealing with customer service to get help with a problem they’re supposed to track themselves....Anyways! Save money and headaches and buy these!
5,I use these in my HP OfcJet 4650. After only purchasing HP ink and then having them tell me that inkjet printers need to be used regularly or the ink will dry and you have to buy more even though the cartridge is half full - I figure I don't need to spend HP prices for half the ink.  Apparently if you only print about once a month or less you should have a Laserjet. Well these cartridges are fine so far and I will continue to go this route.
5,Used with home computer printer for various projects & papers.
4,Name brand ink without the name brand price. It works really well with my HP printer. It does what it supposed do and prints without any issues. My only thing is that I wish it also gave instructions/information on where to send my used ink cartridges so they can be recycled as well.
5,These cartridges seem to last much longer than even the XL cartridges bought locally.
5,Works as expected
2,This is the second purchase through Amazon. Both cartridges worked well the first time. On the most recent order the 63xl color worked well. The black cartridge would not connect with the printer.
5,These ink cartridges are perfect they last a long time and much less $$ than HP brand ink cartridges.  I print a lot of stuff for work and these last me several months probably over a year for the average person.Tip: after awhile if your printer says low ink levels it can still print perfectly fine for a long time. :) I used to immediately replace the cartridge but discovered it’s still good for longer.
4,The color seemd fine right from the start; however the black printed the first half dozen pages or so in a purple then changed to black.  Its too soon to comment on the longevity but for now I would order it again.
5,cheap price
4,So far these have performed well and were much less expensive than the HP cartridges.  I was particularly happy to get the XL size for what I soul lbs have paid for the regular capacity HP cartridges which cost more than what I paid for the printer.
4,Nearly as good as the original as far as I can tell. Had a small ink blot from the black cartridge on the first print job but after that it was fine.  You can't beat it for the money thpugh.
4,Happy with product. Will purchase again
5,I purchased this ink to replace the expensive instant ink program from HP. It was cheaper and my printer recognized it as ‘remanufactured hp ink.”  Prints great! I can’t speak to longevity yet as my kids keep the printer humming printing pictures but they’re coming out great. I’ll buy another set as backup because they work great and are cheaper than the “instant ink” program.
4,Pricing is a bit high. It’s ink so quality is a mute point
4,The Cartridge working fine and print well excepting there is some ink leaking in the package and is hard to clean off.
5,These Ink Cartridges are great. Good Value for Money. I was dubious because they weren't the name brand and less expensive but these were easy to load and have a strong ink print. With Fast Delivery and Saving Money as well I would order from this company again. A+ Seller.
4,The dual ink package is great this the second set we purchased in a little over a year. My kids use this printer for their school work which has seen daily use as both are remote schooling.
4,Easy of use for general office printing
5,I've tried remanufactured and generic ink cartridges several times and have always been disappointed.  Either they run out of ink or get clogged or just won't work with a HP printer.  These cartridges are remanufactured genuine HP cartridges and have plenty of ink.  They are completely compatible with HP printers and work great!
4,Product worked fine.
4,For the most part this ink worked well we had some issues installing them and it took a few tries for the printer to register these new cartridges. Will probably buy again based on price.
5,For our needs (basic printing assignments for school and recipes and such) it works just fine. I’m not sure if we’re getting as many pages as the genuine HP cartridge but I feel like the savings makes up for that.Also in the past with other refurb cartridges I’ve had issues with our printer “reading”them I had no issues with these.
4,These ink cartridges do the job but they required some work to fit in the printer. They had to be cleaned as there was ink smeared all over the cartridges and electrical connectors.
4,The reservoir is to small.This is marketing to force you to buy more cartilages.
5,I have bought remanufactured cartridges before and they didn't last or didn't start out dark at all.  This combo pack has been great.  I can't tell you about longevity because It hasn't run out it is fairly new.  I can tell you I noticed a difference immediately and will buy this one again.
5,I am at my parents helping them recover and have an online business where I print and and cut a lot of things. Got this ink because I needed to get a job done and it’s perfect! Honestly no difference between this and the HP ink I buy for my printer at home. Soooo happy! And it’s the large cartridges WIN!
4,Just as good as the name brand and can’t beat the price. The only downfall is if your specific printer won’t take “recycled” ink cartridges. Mine will say but doesn’t reject it. Thankfully!
4,Easy to load. Little hard to remove protective film.
3,My HP Envy 4520 recognized the color cartridge but not the black one. I have ordered from this company before and both worked fine..but not this time.
4,This is my second purchase of these.  Thuggery work as well as the HP ones I had originally.  I am quite satisfied with the print quality and performance.
5,I've put in the black cartridge and it works good so far.  I have not printed more than a handful of pages yet but so far no issues with the print quality or getting the new cartridge recognized.  I have not opened the color cartridge yet.
5,I got this because it was cheaper but I was surprised when the ink lasted alot longer. I printed cookie labels thinking after 6 the ink would be gone but ended up printing a few thing before and 60 of the labels and still have ink. I'm ordering more.
5,I had always purchased HP replacement cartridges in the past. So I'm a first time user of this product. I am quite pleased at the richness in color that has continued for weeks. I would recommend this product as a suitable replacement for HP 63.
5,Prints just like a brand new cartridge but for a fraction of the price. This is my second time ordering this brand it work perfect for my HP office jet printer. I don't print a lot just basic documents and occasionally some color photos and I cannot complain about the quality.
4,Look good I'm not sure I've used them yet though just extras only reason for my four star review.
4,It’s a great price for both inks but you can notice it’s a little less quality printing..
4,Works well so far
5,These ink cartridges worked great and were far less expensive then the HP brand. We print a lot but I felt like they didn’t last as long as the on brand ones. Overall I’ll be buying again because of the price and print quality.
5,Print quality has been excellent. Cannot judge longevity yet…
2,It is a hit or miss I bought the cartridge a month ago and the ink was at a high amount and one day to the next my printer isn’t accepting the ink
3,The color cartridge that came in this 2 pack would not work in my printer. I could tell by looking at it that it did not match up with the inside of the printer holder. Very sissy and had no time to deal with it not working so I had to by a new color cartridge. Oddly the black ink was fine.
5,This product is comparable to the other “name brand” cartridges I have ordered in the past. The color and print quality are exceptional and the price is highly competitive and extremely reasonable. I will be putting this on a subscription basis moving forward because I am that pleased with my purchase.
5,A great value for the money
4,Work good in my HP printer no problems. Everything prints just like original ink cartridges.
5,I price these out everywhere they were 100.00 just for ink I found these on Amazon and thought I’m saving money let me tell you  they came in and I opened the package they were like new I put them in the printer u can’t tell a difference I’ll be purchasing them again !
5,The product was nicely packaged. It shows as a full refurbished ink cartridge in my printer.  And it has clear defined lines during printing.
5,For general printing this product is well worth it.
4,These print cartridges print just as well as the brand new ones. I’ve bought several over the years.
4,These came super fast and they fit our HP printer. Happy with the price. :)
5,Great value for the money
5,UPDATEDWE received replacement cartridges and they seem to work very well - we thank the company for quick responseOur HP printer hated these...everytime we started the printer it wanted to “realign.” They didn’t print properly...useable
5,Finally an off brand I k cartridge that works as if it were original name ink cartridges. I have only used for a short period but if it continues as present use will definitely purchase again. Pictures are vivid & text is bold and perfect.
4,Runs out fairly quickly.  But quality is good so I am re-ordering...
5,Snap in replacements for the HP brand at a significant discount
5,Item shipped quickly. This is my first time to purchase these cartridges from this seller. After using my printer several times these cartridges perform just as good as new store bought cartridges but at half the price! I will be a returning customer.
1,I had ordered this as back up and just installed a couple of weeks back. After a few prints the cartridge is not being recognized at all. Now my printer itself has stopped taking prints with message of carriage doesn't communicate with printer.
2,Sadly after installing these new inks and printing some pictures they all came out like this. I cleaned the ink heads with q-tips and tried again but sadly it's still orange. Ink levels are also below full and we just installed them. We've never had a problem with the printer bad have been using it just fine until we needed to switch inks. Won't be buying from this company again.
5,Prints great to me.
5,I've tried other remanufactured inks and they definitely do not work as advertised...these however have been wonderful and I will buy again when I need more.  Also such a great price--no reason not to try these cartridges!
4,Works just as good as name brand.
5,These were the first remanufactured ink cartridges that worked perfect right out of the box. All the other non-hp ink I always have to put extra effort to be able to use in my printer but these we just like genuine hp ink.
5,Unless you're needfully discerning or needlessly picky these cartridges work perfectly well for everyday use. Have not tried them in photo mode however. They are indeed worth the price for my needs.
4,Great product used to be a little bit cheaper $29 instead of $39
4,Worked great in my printer. Needed because working at home.
5,Great purchase and exceptional value! Worked perfectly. I've had this installed for a few weeks and I've had no issues with print quality at all.  I use it for small business printing (shipping labels packing slips etc.).
4,So far so good! Can't tell the difference with the hp ink.
5,Awesome way to save money on printer ink! Will keep buying as long as it is for sale!
4,Print quality and value for money .
4,It is a value for the price. The print quality is ok.
4,Good quality ink just doesn’t last long
4,Printed just like the original hp ink.
4,I the quality  and cost of this product
5,So much more for your money! These cartridges work great with quality prints. It’s crazy how much ink costs. It costs less to buy a new printer. Buying these are a real value for your money.
5,Instantly installed and worked. As good as the original!
3,The quality of the pictures I printed out using these cartridges just is not the same as the "real thing".  I print out pictures and colors are not what I need for what I do but they are probably fine for just everyday printing.
5,I got about 8 months out of this ink set - even tho it claimed far less I was very pleased with the quality of the printed material the price of the ink set and of course Amazon's super fast delivery.
4,Easy install
4,Good value for the cost!
4,Great lower cost replacement ink option.
5,These refill cartridges are just as good as the original HP ink and last equally as long yet half the price of new HP cartridges.
5,These cartridges work great!  I was skeptical at first but after trying them I will not buy the name brand ones again.  Long lasting and the print quality is great!
5,Print quality is comparable to if not better than other cartridges I’ve purchased in the past. Great value and works well with my printer. Highly recommend and will definitely purchase again!
5,Great printouts at half the price!
4,Easy to install and good print quality
4,A very fine product. No complaints at all.
5,Item was in stock priced right shipped and delivered quickly.  Print quality and color adequate for personal use.  Would buy again.
5,Bought as I had unenrolled from the hp ink program and it disabled the ink I had in. So far no issues with the print quality but haven’t tried printing pictures in the glossy paper.
4,Worked fine for me
5,It worked with my HP 3830 printer and was more affordable than the official ink. It worked well on photo paper and had a nice gloss when printed. It also worked well with labels too.
5,These recycled in cartridges work just as well as those from HP. So happy to have this less expensive option that works just fine. Excellent value for the money.
5,Ink has been good for me.  And I am satisifed with it and just reordered.Thanks.
5,They arrived pretty quick and no problem installing on my printer and the print quality was very good. Happy with my purchase
5,The ink is very bright. I really like it and recommend this product.
5,Print quality is not good. I always buy this type but this one was not good one. Also it lasted less printing same documents as I usually do
3,Great for regular printing but horrible for printing photos. Photos had streaks and weird wet marks (after 24hrs of drying)
5,Very happy with this ink! Great value and it works great with our HP printer. We've used it both for business and personal artwork purposes and have been very pleased with the quality.
5,Decided to try this because the hp ink cartridges are costly and...I didn’t even notice the difference! Same fit same quality but way cheaper. It’s a win in my book!
5,Thank you thank you thank you!!!  Finally I've come across a compatible cartridge that is cost-effective.
5,I was skeptical about purchasing a unknown remanufactured ink. But I did and I must say I was completely surprised by the print quality. There's no difference at all. I would definitely purchase again.
5,I thought it wasn't gonna work on my printer but it did and it even shows the information of how much tint it has . Five stars
5,I use my printer a lot for work and although it does not have the gloss that a copier has the quality of ink and richness is perfect
5,The print qaulity waa pretty good and the sheerness was second to none real value for money. Normally replacement ink wont work in my printer but this one worked like a charm.
5,Perfect no issues and print quality is great!
5,I love this ink. Great quality
5,So far these cartridges are working well with my new printer. No error messages! Print quality seems good. I’m just using for everyday printing.
4,Works as expected.
5,I have an HP printer and these ink cartridges worked perfectly. Easy to use and great price! Had no issues installing the cartridges either.
5,Nothing bad to say about it Price can't beat it Quality Better than mfrs.. Longeveityx4. Will not void WARRANTY!!!
5,Great product just like HP.
5,The quality is great because it is very clear with little to no smudges. It also has a very vibrant color when the fresh paper comes out of the printer.
5,Affordable quality printer carts! I will definitely buy again.
5,Good price and they actually work very well. I've had trouble in the past with my printer not recognizing re-manned cartridges but these work perfectly and last a long time.
5,These cartridges where exactly is ordered. They worked in the printer quickly and produce a great print. But so using I ordered them problem with a cheap price!!!
5,Great ink with no issues from used cartridges (my printer gets fussy with some cartridges). A fast shipper as well with food packaging
5,This is the second time I've purchased these. I don't need to buy brand new as long as they aren't dried up! Im all for recycling. Will buy again.
4,Works as advertised and good value.
5,Works just as well as authentic HP ink.  Easy install no problem with quality of printing-  much cheaper then HP ink and no noticeable differences!
4,Prints well.
4,Good stuff
5,Buena calidad
5,This product works well it registers like a new HP cartridge when you replace it.
2,I purchased these for my HP printer that I’ve only ever used HP brand ink. Worked great at first! My printer doesn’t recognize these ink cartridges so I have to hit “ok” a lot on the screen but not a big deal. In the 3 months I’ve had these (color and black cartridges) and maybe 200 printed pages the color is shot. The black also spewed on me when I pulled it out of the printer. Definitely not worth the price difference between brand product ink.
5,Works just as well as the original. Have not been using long enough to rate longevity.
5,Not sure of how long they last because they’re still going!  Prints good and much more reasonable
1,After installing the ink worked fine the first day- then getting error message on second day saying cartridge won't align. Tried various times and it just doesn't work anymore. My return window is closed as well. Not buying again
5,Print quality
5,Works as I need it to. Cheaper than HP ink. Hopefully it won't clog the surface like HP warns for off brand ink.
5,I have bought these ink cartridges multiple times with no problem. Easy install. Works just like the expensive ones.
5,I have seen no difference between the name brand and this product. I love the discounted price and I love the idea of reducing waste in the environment
5,So far we are impressed...the printer recognized the replacement cartridge as original/hp and its quality has been worth the money.
5,Print value is great!!!
5,Great option to paying full price hpink. I print alot for school  and the xl cartridge lasts  longer.  Great print  quality.
5,Nice product for a lot less money
5,First black one smudged when print the color works great. This was on the second pair I brought hopefully the next time will be better
5,Bought these larger capacity cartridges and have had no issues. Print quality is the same as OEM cartridges from what I can see.
4,Good product
5,these work okay for remanufactured ink cartridges
5,I like the easy use in the change out of ink cartridges. Just as good or better than name brand inks!
5,Delivery was fast quality seems to be great so far definitely a good buy for the money.
5,This ink had amazing print quality. It Lasted and it was a great value for the money. I will definitely be ordering these again.
5,This product was the perfect ink i was looking for. It makes the quality of my papers amazing.
4,As expected
5,The printing quality is quite good. Cartridges last a long time. Depending upon how much you print off.
5,The printing is high quality and for the cost you can not tell a difference from the brand name
2,Printed around 250 pages and the ink was gone. Will not buy again.
5,The print quality was very good and the price was great too! I will be purchasing again!
5,They actually work just like the manufacturers version! My documents print and look just as then did when I purchased the brand that came with the unit originally.
5,Fits perfectly was hesitant at first to buy but after receiving and using it I will definitely continue to purchase!
5,Working perfectly Print quality as good as the brand name. No issues with my printer recognizing the cartridges.
5,HP printer.  These inks work as well as the expensive inks. I will definitely buy again.
5,Ink works great! I see no difference between this and the branded ink. Great value for the money. I’ll be buying again!
1,nothin at all to like ink never dried on pictures.  Cartridges leaked inside of my printer.  Amazon shouldn't sell them
5,This was a great value for the money. I was impressed with the print quality and I we purchase this product again.
5,Print quality is great! It is actually printing better than the cartridges that came with my new printer.
5,Such a good deal and the ink was the same quality if I spent twice the price.
5,With everyone home ans using the printer we’re going through ink rapidly. This was a great quality at a good price
5,This ink worked great! I will be buying this again!

5,Works great for my printer. I've been using it for a while and have had no issues.
5,Great fit. Print quality is same as hp supplies
1,I installed these in my HP printer in March.  Now all of a sudden in June the quality is blurred and now I'm getting an error that the cartridges are install incorrectly or they are incompatable.  Very disapointed since i have very few prints on these cartridges.
5,Happy with the price and fit in my HP Office Jet 5255 perfectly.
5,Ink does it's job. I am happy with the product.
5,Worked just as good as the name brand ink that cost twice as much.

5,Ink is good quality and last awhile. Great value for the money.

5,Exactly as expected just as quality as brand new cartridges. Great value.
5,Prints quality was ok what I didn’t like is that it didn’t last long.
5,Vibrant prints and lasted longer than others I've purchased
1,It lasted a few days and I barely printed anythingI ordered this last month it arrived around Halloween and I installed it about 9 or 10 days ago nowI printed maybe 25-30 copies (not a lot of ink required) and both the color and the black are empty and I need to order new ones.It is safe to say I will not be ordering from them again and I can honestly say Spend the extra money and get a named brand refill. I have in the past and never had an issue I will be going back to that...I was very disappointed hoped for the best received the worse.
5,Love this product!  I will definitely order again!  Thanks for offering it♥️

5,Good
1,The colored ink dose not print the right colored ink it's all wrong
2,Work great initially with my HP printer. However after a few weeks the black ink was printing right and when I went to realign it it leaked all over. I was within my return time frame and I returned it. Waiting for the replacement.
1,I have only tried the color cartridge.  It does not work.
1,I always buy this brand of ink cartridge and have had no previous problems but this time I inserted the color cartridge and it worked for just a few days and now it gets an error message on my printer and asked me to change the cartridge.  So I had to throw out an almost full cartridge!  Can you please remedy this?
1,Worked at first but after printing some 10 pages the cartridge wouldn’t be recognized by the printer. Suspect it’s the electronics in the cartridge that may have faulted. Disappointed.
2,the cartridges it's regular size  they are not X large.
1,This ink is not working in my HP Printer.  I have tried 2 different cartridges and they are not working.It is printing "double" letters and lines.  I tried realigning the print too.I won't be buying this again.
2,Print quality is terrible. The color is not 100% some missing in printed words so blurry words.
2,Only one of the cartridges would sync to my printer. The magnetic strip on the one that wouldn't sync was completely different.
1,Color cartridge doesn't work properly.  A month after installation the cyan ink started leaking and getting on the part of the cartridge the printer uses to detect you have the right cartridge.  I would wipe it off and then it would work again.  Magenta also ran out very quickly.
1,I received this and the color one was empty
1,none of these ink cartridges worked at all NONE I tried returning them but because I order them as extras for my office when I tried using them the "return policy" had already expired. Now I am stuck with ink I can't use.
1,I had purchased these in the past with no problem  albeit notably short ink life. This time my printer kept reading incompatible cartridge and when I finally got it to accept the color picture came out with a pink hue. Disappointed and will be returning for HP brand name.
1,Bought the pack of black and color ink for my hp4520 and the black is not working at all. We've done everything possible according to instructions and it's just obviously not a good product. NOT happy with wasting this money.
1,worked at first and now I just keep getting an error. just splurge and get the HP product.
2,These would not work on my HP. I suppose it could be a one off but I had to send them back.
1,I was able to print 10 pages. Ten. And now I get an error telling me the cartridge isn’t installed correctly and I can’t fix it. However another cartridge from another company works. Waste of money.
1,This product is not compatible with HP Envy 4520. Do not waste your money.
2,The color one didn’t work at allHaven’t had long enough to review longevity
1,Popped the suckers in to get ready to do some projects won't recognize the black ink at all and the color cartridge isn't printing as it should. Total waste of money and time.
1,False Advertisement...After installation we go "incompatible cartridge" from HP printer 4520.
1,Contrast is poor. When I opted for Black and white only feature for printing- whisps of black printed making it illegible. I had to select color to have a successful legible print.Black outline come out blue. Yellow is greenish.I’ve bought refillable cartridges before from another company (solid quality) but they were out of stock and chose this. Never again.
1,I took a chance ordering these because I loved the price and they shipped quickly!  Well sadly the color gave me a malfunction and didn't work.  I had to send back and order regular HP for my printer.
1,Ink was not working this time. I usually always order my ink from here and this was the first time I have an issue like this
2,Must have gotten a dud. Printed twice and the colored ink only prints yellow.
1,Tried to install and printer would not accept. Message on printer indicated "incompatible cartridges". Now my "easy" "money saving" online shopping has turned into a chore as I have to drive to a UPS store to return for a refund.
1,Ordered three months ago to have it as a back up I tried to use it  and the printer doesn’t recognize the color cartridge. Now can’t return it because it passed the warranty time. Waste of money !
1,The black cartridge doesn't work. Color working fine but hard to get replacement. Amazon sent me to the seller who you have to email and wait.I needed this now.
1,The cartridges were empty
1,Ink seems to be dried out.. very disappointed and a waste of money..
1,saving till needed
2,Don't waste your time & money
1,The color ink cartridge did not work. No way to contact the seller.
1,Waste of money. Just bought these and there is no ink in the tri color cartridge. Save yourself the frustration and buy somewhere else!
1,The ‘brand new’ black ink cartridge will not print right from the box. Followed all instructions and it does not work.
1,I put the new cartridge in and got less that 20 copies before it was done.  I tried shaking it but no help.  A waste of money.  Won't try that again!
1,Does not work
1,The cartilages would not fit into my printer and this is the Ink number I always use.  It was past my return date so I am completely out of my money.
1,Didn't work. Has to be real HP ink cartridges.  Totally false advertising on these products!  Beside that the messed up the shipping!
1,Printer doesn’t recognize
1,Had to return. The item did not work. It kept giving me an error message even after following all instructions ..
1,The color cartridge is totally off.  My images have no green or blue so will only buy HP products moving forward.
1,could not use these on my printer.
1,Would not work. The printer HP kept having an error reading do to the cartridge. Bought an HP cartridge and it worked immediately. I would not buy again! 👎🏼
1,Black cartridge was labeled wrong and did not fit. I have ordered before and did not have issues.
1,When printing it just leaks out and smears all over the paper
1,The ink cartridge was broke and could not be used.  my printer has not yet worked again.  This was a total rip off
1,Color ink cartridge would not read in my HP printer. The black worked fine but color was useless. Waste of money.
1,This is literally the second one I had shipped out to me the label was peeling off that the printer reads and yet again it said it’s not the right ink...
1,Couldn’t get the cartridges to seat properly. So would not print!!
1,Does not work with my HP Office Jet 3830. Super disappointing!
1,This is the print job from these cartridges. So disappointed in the quality.
1,Product not recognized by my printer.  I had to run to the nearest store and purchase new because these were defective
1,Installed the new cartridges and it does not detect them so they will not print.
1,Waste of money Ink dried up in 2 days would not recommend this ink
1,I need my money back !!!! Do not buy it  bad quality
1,The ink cartridges were supposed to be comparable to the HP63 they are bigger so did not fit my printer.
1,It did not work for me. I will be returning.
1,Biggest waste of money ever. Never again.
1,Printer started showing error codes “unable to find printer cartridge “ after less than 10 pages printed.
1,
1,Does not fit into printer
1,Received a set of open and clearly nearly empty used HP cartridges instead of the product described
1,Did not work.
1,Despite the guarantee on the listing that these would be recognized by my HP printer they were not. I returned them for a full refund.
1,Colored ink turned out to be black.
1,Color cartridge not working.
1,2 shipments. First one defective. Second one printer messaged incompatible cartridges.
1,Did not work! A total waste of money!!! Grrrr!Never again!!!! Enjoy MY money!
1,My printer wouldn’t print it said low quality ink.
1,lasted a week and my printer says it is improper
1,Didn’t work as intended. Maybe I got a bad batch.
1,The black ink cartridge was empty....I could not make even 1 copy.
1,Didn't work with my printer
1,Color cartridge did not work.
1,Product was damaged
2,These cartridges work for roughly 3 days then the printer begins throwing a message that they are loaded improperly. If you take them out and reinstall they will work for roughly another 3 days. At that point the printer informs you that it is out of ink and will no longer print anything despite being nearly full.
1,My color cartridge was empty so I ordered these.  Two months later my black went empty.  I put in the black cartridge and the printing was steaked and nonexistent in spot.  After going through the cleaning aligning and ECT... procedures no luck.  I needed it to work so I picked up a HP cartridge from Bestbuy.  Worked great out of the box.  I you buy these use them right away to make sure you have time to return them if you have an issue.
1,The colored ink worked great in my HP but the black ink had the incorrect chip on it and my printer did not accept it even though it says it’s a 63XL
5,I have had issues in the past with some generic cartridges. This one is working well! The quality is just as well as the name brand. I dont have any issues with smudging on regular paper.
5,The colors are vivid and accurate the print quality is perfect! Clean lines and no blots or stray droplets/leaks have been detected.I will definitely purchase again!!
5,The price is amazing! I was warned that it could ruin my printer but this far all is well. Great quality! I am very happy with this product!
4,Perfect replacement for my HP printer. Half the price should have ordered more as my kids are remote learning and have to print off assignments daily. Can’t really notice a difference in print quality. The black print deep and rich and the colors look just as bold as if they were HP replacement cartridges.Will order again.
1,I couldn’t even get one print from the color cartridge. Would not recommend.
5,Works perfectly much less expensive than HP!
1,Printing quality is good but it jams 4/5 times.
5,I love it. It's a great value for your money.
5,Great quality no issues ever with these. Will definitely continue to use these
4,The only thing I have an issue with is that once something prints it looks really grainy not a big deal with most things but pictures are not the greatest.
5,Print quality is great. Very good price.
5,Works great can not complain
4,Works great in my HP all in one
5,NICE
5,Just as good as Any other printer cartridges I’ve purchased. Quality of print is excellent but that do seem to run out a little quicker I think.
5,Just as good as the hp brand!!
5,This is a great quality product there is no way to notice the difference between this product and the original defenitely I fully recommend to buy this product
5,I like it even though the package was little bit open
5,Prints out with great color & I love the longevity of the ink.
5,I print labels everyday. This ink is just as good as the brand name cartridges. I’m so glad I found another affords option.
5,Dude al comprarla pues era más barato que el precio de la marca original... pero quede satisfecha.Muy buen producto lo recomiendo.
5,The cartridges fit perfectly in our printer and they printed out onto paper so well! No splotches or shadow or anything like that. Great!
5,Works just as good as the HP cartridges.
5,Nice color when printing.
5,Very good value for the money.
5,They worked just fine and I was able to save some money. Will continue to keep using
5,Value for money
5,For home use only
5,I have not used  the product yet but will when my cartridge runs out
5,Great cartridge
5,Print really good
5,Great for the price
5,It worked well with my printer.
5,Printed like name brand
5,Value for your money
5,Clear printed
5,Works perfectly - no issues. Just as good as the name brand at a fraction of the cost.
5,The cost savings alone for this bundled item is awesome compared to HP’s ink cartridges. And they both worked fine in my HP Envy 4520!
5,I have never purchased after market ink in my 20 plus tease of using printing products.  As OEM prices for ink kept rising it was almost cheaper buying a new printer each time the ink ran out!  So why not try a generic brand?  If it ruined the printer big deal it was time to get a new printer anyhow right?  I was very pleasantly surprised however as the ink has worked flawlessly as I printed all my Christmas cards this year.  I will never buy HP’s ink again.  Their years of milking this (cash) cow are over.
5,Just what I needed! Cheap and does a good job printing!
1,Black seems fine but the tricolor did not work properly. The blue just stopped working after printing 3 pages of text and 2 pictures. Now when I try to print a clip art picture of the earth (just blue and green) it comes out pink and green. It was worth a shot but this shot missed. I’m going back to un-used/new HP ink cartridges.
4,My printer
5,Very affordable and comparable to the name brand!
5,Great value!! Fast shipping!!
5,It is easy and works
5,I have found that this refilled ink lasts longer than the other ones so it’s worth it
5,Highly recommend!!! These print just as good as the HP brand for over 1/2 the cost!! Extremely satisfied with this purchase!!! I will be purchasing these in the future!!!♥️
1,I printed out 2 pages that didn’t have much color and when printing the 3rd page printer said running low on ink.
5,I was hesitant to buy remanufactured ink cartridges but I try to save money whenever the opportunity presents itself.  This product produces a high quality print.  I am very pleased!
5,I was hesitant to order because they were not a n"name brand".I stand corrected these so far are working great & will order again
5,This product has been excellent. The color quality for pictures is great And it has lasted way longer then expected.
5,only gave it 3 stars on longevity because I just installed the cartridges so I don't know how they will last
2,I bought this in March and placed it in my printer a few months ago. Normally I buy the hp brand but decided to give this a try. Well when I did print the quality was great. The number of prints however was very limited. I only used this to print words nothing with pictures. The printer told me low ink and even with the hp cartridge it will tell me this but can still print multiple pages before it stops. Well it stop printing in black. From the pictures there was plenty of ink in the cartridge and no reason for this. I feel taken advantage of and NEVER again will buy this. Do yourself a favor and buy the brand that is made buy your printer!!
5,Well I'll be damned!  I guess that I am the last one to trust a remanufactured ink product for my 3 HP printers but the cost savings finally pushed me to try it - and I am very satisfied.  Even my smart printer knew what I had done but accepted it without a problem. And so far the cartridges have worked perfectly. Now I think of all the money I could have saved over the years... son of a gun.
5,This ink works very well in my printer. Printing is very crisp and clean. Have had no problems at all. Printer is an HP Deskjet 3630. Would reccomend.
5,Fit perfectly
5,The cartridges work well and they shipped quickly
4,We got these cartridges for an HP 5255 printer. No problems at all. Now the printer actually prints. My only real criticism is that these cartridges are not cheap. We bought the first set just to get the printer to work (it did with the new cartridges). We bought the second set to keep in reserve when the first set runs out (at some point in the future).
5,My printer didn’t recognize the ink at first but if you turn everything on and back on it works
5,Just what I needed for my printer
5,great
5,Excellent value for the dollar.
5,Nice
5,These work great.
1,I am highly disappointed and extremely annoyed! Just got this today. Making things for my son's birthday party. Put the ink in.. printed 22 colored pictures and my black ink is now at half way level and my 23rd & 24th print didn't print properly.  Colors are fading already! .so friggin mad I wasted this money and have to buy new ink and can't get my project done!Plus when I took it out it leaked all over me!Horrible product!1st pic is how 22 printed. Then 2nd print is how the next 2 printed.
5,I liked the value and the fact that the cartridge was recycled. The print is very clear and bright. Will definitely purchase again.
5,Best value I could find since HP charged over double!
5,I buy again
5,So far so good.  My HP printer so far hasn't rejected the ink.  The quality is comparable to the genuine in black and color.
3,The print quality isn’t quite as sharp as a new cartridge.
5,Used it for my hp printer
5,Gave in and went non brand....Great value for the money! Print quality is great. Very happy... Will buy again!!
5,Just right
5,Works just as good as name brand ink
5,Love these. They print out great. The value is awesome. I needed it for my son's all in one printer. And the ones for this printer was over priced in the store. And I couldn't find them at Wal-Mart. So Amazon was my next choice. I just had to wait for delivery. Will reorder.
5,It worked great for my hp4520 .Love the quality.Read some reviews and it scared mehowever I took a chance because if the price.It's legit.
5,Works just like an HP original for less. Great value for the money!
4,I'm satisfied with them but the price dropped down just after I had bought them. So sad!
