5,Perfect
5,I was a bit apprehensive to purchase a used unit.  I read several reviews and most customers appeared pleased with them.  I received the unit yesterday plugged it in and am happy to report that the unit just works.
5,After trying many docks this one works perfectly for both my Windows laptop and 2019 Macbook Pro 16in. Make sure you download the "DisplayLink Manager Graphics Connectivity" driver on your Macbook so it'll work! I have 3 2k monitors. 2 of them being 27inch and the other one being a 32inch monitor.5/5
5,I purchased this for my telework setup and wanted to save some money where I could. I have no complaints. The station was in great condition and works like a charm.
4,Needed a docking station to run two monitors this seems like on of the better options. You need the  DisplayLink software loaded along with an extension to get the dock to work.With two external monitors you have to wait until the computer has booted and then plug the dock in. There is also a delay in using a Logitech mouse that has the USB dongle that is plugged into the docking station. Takes a bit before it is recognized.
5,The dock is working on M1 Macbook Pro so good that you can't tell which monitor is native and which is from the dock itself.After an issue the first device had the seller was very helpful and replaced the dock in just a few days.Totally recommend this to everyone!
5,product works great for powering my usb-c latitude laptop and running 3 monitorshave also connected a 2010 model laptop through the USB III (blue) adapter and it works great toousing this in my home officehappy with the price and performance
5,There is nothing to dislike and everything to like - dock is used in an office environment - other than a few minor cosmetic blemishes (who cares) it is a tool - Dell sells the same item for 199.00 - makes no difference in functionality which is all that matters
5,Looks good. Works good.
3,Pricey for what it is! The price of these is crazy. Works well - for older laptops they might need an update
5,I'm able to share my monitors between my laptop and desktop pc. Love it.
5,I had no issues with it working out of the box but I use the same type at work.
1,Docking stations nothing much to say about them really you plug everything in place it in the corner of the desk and just work no moving parts never moved etc.Well this refurbished one started to go on the blink after 4 months the monitor that was plugged into the HDMI port would stop receiving signal once the monitor had been power cycled everything would be ok for a week or two. Thought it was the cables or the monitor and I replaced both but now the HDMI port is dead as a doornail.Obviously no support for refurbished product after 90 days. Lessons learned.
1,States "There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm’s length" however it came with big scratches dust and worn inputs.
1,This item has failed within less than 1 year and i would like to have this replaced or have a full refund.
3,I have used this dock for 3 laptops.The first one was a low-end laptop. It worked fine. Charged and the monitors worked through the Thunderbolt3 connection.The second one is an Acer Predator Triton 500. It does not charge through the Thunderbolt connection - I don't think it provides enough wattage. Monitors worked okay for a while then stopped working. They both started working again after updating the firmware on the dock.The third is a 2019 MacBook Pro. This one charges. None of the monitors worked until I updated the drivers - they would disconnect whenever I tried to switch inputs and then reconnect when they weren't displaying anything - super odd. Now one of the two (the HDMI 2.0 one) works but the other (on DisplayPort) is not recognized by the computer. However it still blacks out the screen when I unplug it indicating that on some level the dock still sees it. I'm not sure how to get that fixed.
5,Les docking sont bien emballé et le vendeur est très réactif.Je recommande !!!
5,utiliser tous les jours sans soucis avec deux écrans ethernet et deux usb jamais eu de soucis sauf avec un cable ethernet défectueux qui faisait planter le pc au complet
