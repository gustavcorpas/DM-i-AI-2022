5,This super long printer cable is a great purchase! It’s thick and durable and a great value. My home office space is limited and this cord made all the difference in my productivity.
5,Nice long printer cord works great
5,Could find the original cord for my printer. This was the perfect replacement. Nice strong construction. Set it and forget it.
5,Works as advertised - it's a printer cable...
5,Very happy.
4,Well Im not a rocket scientist so therefore cannot get my printer hooked up. I really believe if you know what you are doing this would be a great product  Signed Too Old School
5,Needed a longer printer cord for my Cricut Maker. This worked - even with updating the firmware. Thanks!
5,I have a Dell 825 Laser air printer. Which works great for printing from my iPhone and iPad but I could no longer scan to my computer.I have an old Apple computer and I was told that if I updated my computer at the tune of over $2000. my printer would communicate with the new computer. I bought this cable and installed it and the scanning problem was solved. I love it when I can solve a problem.
5,Works great! No complaints.
5,I am very satisfied with the product.
5,I purchased this to move my printer across the room and it worked perfectly! The correct length and very durable.
5,The length of the cord was a plus and it fit perfect
5,Excellent product!
5,Does what it's supposed to.
5,no dislikes
5,I like the length of the cord and the fact that I just needed one for my Epson printer which I love....it is a great investment I needed in order to complete my work.
5,Real sturdy piece of equipment. Braiding is just stiff enough where it bends but you know it is not going to kink or break.
5,Just as I ordered and worked straight from the box.
5,Does exactly what it’s suppose to do. I run my 3d printer off of this from across the room. Very happy.
5,I moved recently and of course couldn't locate my printer cord.  This one is wonderful works like a charm and long enough!!
5,This cable was exactly as described. It appears to be durable. It was great to get a longer cable at a attractive price
5,Product came on time in perfect condition and as described. Works like a champ with no issues.
5,Good product.
5,price
5,Excellent quality that was an easy installation...with the length of the cable was able to move the printer and computer around the room with cable to spare.  Well made product and great value.  Will order a 2nd for my other office once the remodeling is complete.
5,Cable arrived in good time. Handles data transfers real fast. No complaints
5,All these years and I had no idea this cable even existed. You have no idea how much frustration you have relieved. The cable works perfectly. It's sturdy doesn't tangle and a life saver.
5,It was exactly what I wanted
5,Good product so far. Quick delivery
5,Perfect! Plug and go!
5,Use these cords to charge several items. Never a problem
5,The WiFi on my Epson printer suddenly quit working after a few years of good service. I tried everything imaginable to get it back online to no avail. So I decided to hardwire it to my desktop and thank god I did. It works every time and it's faster than WiFi!
5,We had a tree foot scanner chord from our desk top to the printer.  However needing a longer length to reach the new printer stand we search what Amazon had to offer.  We found the Akoada USB Type A Male to B male printer scanner chord for the money.  We received the new chord quickly from Amazon reducing our printer down time. We are very pleased by the excellent heavy duty quality of the chord and connectors.  We have no regrets and highly recommend this item at a great price from Amazon.
4,I bought this thinking it was a b mini since that is what I searched.  Turns out this is not a b mini.  I took a star off for it coming up in the wrong search.  That said it seems like it is made very well and I like the flexibility material it is made with.. but I have no way to test it.  I'm hoping to find someone who may need this kind of cable since I don't want to risk going to the post office for something under 10 bucks.
5,Used it to connect a printer from across the room.
5,It is the third one I ordered so I could make direct connection of two printers and a photo scanner.
5,I got this cable because I inherited an older embroidery machine and did not feel like shelling out a bunch of money to replace the cord. After examining the port looked to be a regular printer cable- and it was! Works perfectly and I am able to move patterns onto the machine with ease.
5,Plug and play nice length so far very reliable.  Excellent value.
5,perfect price for cord.  does what it is supposed to.  happy as usual.
5,Works great! Pretty satisfied with the quality. Had issues printing wirelessly intermittently due to the software updates given us from the “work from home packages” so I eventually got fed up and looked for a printer cord and I’m glad I did. Sometimes the old fashioned way is just what you need now I can print with no hiccups and through a WiFi outage. Well worth it and this cable should last just as long as any cable you have in your home.
4,asdwa
5,Connect printer to computer.
5,Worked like a charm!  I bought a new printer but didn't know how to set up the blutooth.  Got on Amazon and ordered this cable.  I got it the next day!
5,easy connection of printer to laptop.
1,I do not like to write negative reviews but in this instance the product merits a "poor" performance rating.  It may very well be that prior to packaging the product quality was good but it came folded in a tight package with a bend about every 12." (See attached)I bought this as an interface cable between my MIDI interface and my computer for my music studio.  There was a very noticeable crackle when the recording was being done.  In fairness before I traced it down to this cable I tried the one I use for my printer.  There was no crackle when using that printer cable.Bottom line is that maybe they should coil the wire instead of folding it.  The product return window is closed so there will be nothing more that can be done but to buy another brand.
5,I use it to run midi between my midi keyboard & my computer for a DAW setup - keyboard’s on 1 wall - computer’s on the other.  So far no data glitches / dropouts / etc... perfect cable for the job.
5,Great item and great delivery.
5,The cord seems well made and works as it should on my laser printer. Durability remains to be seen since that will take time to assess but I see no reason why it won't hold up. I would recommend these cables to anyone who needs an extended length cable.
5,After a year of troubleshooting contantly going off line slow reponse etc.  I used this cable to connect my hp3510 directly to my computer and solved all the issues...
2,I purchased this for my home office. I do like the outside of the cable. That being said it stopped working 2 days after the return window. Because of this I would not recommend this item.
5,I have very weak WiFi and I could not get my computer to connect to the printer.  This allows me to have my computer anywhere in the room and be able to print.
5,So far the cable has met all my expectations. Very pleased with my purchase. A great value for the money.
5,USB 2.0 Printer Cable very good Thank you very much.
5,It works like it should
5,This was too easy to do. Plug and go. Awesome product and 8t works as it should. I recommend this chord if you need something durable and inexpensive.
5,HAPPY... Does what it’s supposed to do!!! Extra long and durable cord that fits my HP OfficeJet printer perfectly.
5,I had an issue with the original order and I contacted Akoada.  They replied almost immediately were very professional and corrected the problem. Excellent customer service!
5,I ordered a longer cable for my scanner and was shocked when it arrived the next day. I didn't request an overnight shipment so that was great!  The cable was exactly what I needed. I've tested it and it works fine!
5,A+++++
5,The cable was long so the computer and printer did need to be close together.  The product is sturdy and durable.  I was happy with my purchase
5,This solved  the conection problem with the printer
5,Just what I needed physical connection from laptop to printer. Now I can print copy and scan.
5,I really like this cable. It's very well made and sturdy. Plugs in on both ends without a problem and my printer works much better than the unstable wi-fi that I use.  Very good product.
5,Did the job I needed it to do.
5,Es muy buen material y si pude conectar la computadora a la impresora con el cable
5,As a senior with technology dumbness this was easier to plug into my computer than connecting thru the modem:)
5,The product was received within a short period of time and the quality of the cords is excellent as well as the price!
5,Great for my laptop worked like a charm because I lost my epson cord it came with.
5,A very high top quality  wire and is a t least 8 to 10 feet long. Quite satisfied!
5,I love that you plug it into the printer and computer and it works! That is how easy it was.
5,Couldn't get printer to work properly until we got this!! Yay!!
5,Easy to snake around furniture between CPU and printer.
5,This cable is a must have for anyone at home with a HP printer that wants to easily scan.  Great cable.

1,This cord didn’t work at all. I thought it was a problem with my new printer. After exchanging the printer I discovered it was the cord but now it’s too late to return it.
1,I got this and it worked for maybe an hour and then acted like it had a short in it.  Flickered in and out makin my computer go crazy.  Changed wires and it worked fine.  Maybe this was a dud and I just got unlucky.  Just my personal experience.
1,Plugged it in and device wasn't powered on or even had power connected but this thing went up in flames less than 4hrs. Don't buy this unless you want your house to burn down.
2,It works on and off with HP225
1,Cable cannot carry midi or USB audio data fast enough. It great for controller use and probably even a printer... but not for music applications.
1,To connect a printer to computer. It didn’t work.
1,It did not work. Waste of my money and time. Only reason i gave it one star they wouldn't let the review go throuhh without picking one
1,Trying to move a check scanner off of my desk and needed a longer cable. Unfortunately this cable caused errors in the scans.
1,I purchased this in April & was very excited to get it. While it worked great in the beginning then it stopped working in June. So it  was past my return/exchange window so I'm pretty much just put.
1,Quality control failed.
1,Didn’t work at all - had to reuse old one until replacement arrived
1,This cable did not fit my HP Photosmart 7520 printer.
1,This product did not work for scientific instrumentation.
1,It didn’t work on my iPad 8
1,Keep looking. This item is trash.
1,Only charges part of the time very slow
5,Works fantastic!!!!
5,Needed this to reroute a printer to other side of room and it’s perfect for the job. The cord itself looks so nice I don’t even care to hide it.
5,Rapid delivery of an exclent product.
5,I like the braided cable as compared to the standard plastic ones. Having this 15ft cable allowed me to get rid of the 3 shorter cables I had (extensions etc) to span that distance. I'm very pleased with this cable.
1,My new printer usb cord wasn't as long as I would prefer so I purchased this. It literally shorted out in less than 5 minutes.
1,The head has fallen out already in less than a month.. Kind of sad 😔 It would have being a good product because the thickness was sweet it charges well and fast.
5,Good quality so far is good
5,Quick response and surprisd that it was availible for a 15 yr old product; THANK YOU.
5,The cable was more than expected.
5,This product is used for scanning documents from my printer to my laptop. It gets the job done no complaints.
5,I bought this to hook into my resin  printer to update software And it works perfectly so I’m very happy with this purchase would  definitely recommend it
5,who keeps printer cables?  Had to have one and so ordered this one.  Worked as it should - but the cable wasn't the problem!  Oh well.  Will keep it for those times you gotta hard wire.
5,Did what I expected
5,The cable appears well made with the braided design. It was very we’ll packaged and was the perfect length for my set up. Overnight shipping is also a bonus.
5,Great quality
5,Great product.
5,As advertised
5,Moved my Brother printer and needed this cable to reach my PC. Worked seamlessly. Good well made product
5,loved it!!!
5,Got this extension cord my an epson receipt printer and it has been working exceptionally well. The quality is good.
5,made very well and happy with my purchase. I had multiple printers a good distance from computer and these are a great length and good quality
5,Great printer cable.We previously used a 6 ft printer cable with a 6-ft extension. We replaced that with this great printer cable that is 15 ft. he finally figure out how to hook our printer up to Wi-Fi so we don't always need this printer cable. We do however use the printer cable when scanning from the printer to the computer. Also if there is ever a Wi-Fi connection problem it's easy to plug your laptop into the printer.
5,Came fast and was perfect!
5,Very happy with my purchaseWorked great with brother printer
5,Does what it's supposed to do
5,Muy buen artículo  gracias Amazon’s
5,Purchased to connect my Mac mini to my Cricut vinyl for a stronger more stable connection. The wire is well made and appears durable and does the job.
5,My problem of computer-printer connection was that it stopped communicating via wi fi.  This usb cable solved the problem.  Upon connecting the cable computer-printer communicating was restored.
5,We ended up not needing to use this but it seems of good quality for a decent price.
5,Perfect fit...Works Great...
5,Great product would recommend
5,Perfect to connect my printer to my computer when the WiFi isn’t working properly.  My printer cable is not long enough to reach the computer from where we have it set up.
5,Works as advertised. Sturdy? Yes. Long? Yes. Good texture? Also yes.
5,Connects my laptop with my new Canon printer; good fit.
5,This cable connects my printer to the PC.  It works fine and I like the braided look.  It also has a cute little cable tie attached.
5,I bought this for my multifunction printer/ scanner/ copier/ fax machine. HP's sometimes are difficult because they really don't like cheap cables or cables over 6ft long. This cable is 15ft long and nice and sturdy. My laptop and printer found each other immediately when I installed it this time.
5,Works great.  No problems.  Durable cord.
3,my computer and printer
5,I liked everything about this product.
5,Excellent braided covering yet a slim sturdy profile
5,Easy connect/install on my Canon Pixma 7720 by going to the Canon website. Had a recurring problem with the wireless not working. Thought I may need a new printer but decided to give this way of connecting a try. PERFECT! and the design stands out from the other wires on my ‘oldie but goodie’ desktop. Very good product & I’d recommend it highly.
5,Works well for most printers easy to attach and good length.
5,...para conectar mi impresora nueva a la distancia que quería. Es un cable práctico por ser largo ya que la impresora que me compré no es inalámbrica pero el cable la pone en la posición que yo quería ya que éste es de 6 metros. Muy recomendado!
5,The cable looks solid and better than I expected.Received in time. Loved it because my two small orders arrived together. The cable looks solid though I have not used it yet. It is for my second printer.
5,La calidad es muy buena el recubrimiento del cable es de muy buena calidad
