5,I have two of these for my three-monitor set-up at work - I purchased them to allow rotation of the left and right monitors to portrait mode.  The glass base is solid and heavy. There's a shiny side and a matte side - it doesn't seem to matter which side is "up" - so choose whichever you want.  The stands assemble easily the monitors mounted to them easily. I'd read reviews that said they didn't rotate so to make sure you mounted in portrait configuration - however I didn't need to do that so I'm not sure if something changed in manufacturing or what - but the monitors did rotate after mounting. They also tilt (forward/back). Very pleased I purchased these. Our IT techs have been pretty impressed with them and as well.
4,My LG widescreen monitor came with a stand that I immediately didn't care for. I searched for a replacement that was more "me" and came across this one. I was initially skeptical of the glass base but it's thick heavy aesthetically pleasing and very sturdy. The install was pretty straight forward and included screws that fit my monitor. Unfortunately they were too long for the spacers that were also included. I didn't have any spacers on hand or shorter screws that fit but I had lots of washers - and I put them to good use. Because of the way my desktop is situated I have ordered a longer HDMI cable. But that's minor and overall I'm very pleased.
4,Everything black (plus screws) in the photo comes with the stand. The curved cutouts (arrows) give the rear bracket almost zero range for tilting backward (top edge away from user). Plenty of range to tilt forward.The stand is stable enough and the large rectangular base is heavy black glass.4 preset height positions. Don't try to rotate a large monitor on this stand - just pick an orientation and stay with it.Monitor: large heavy 11 year old (but still great specs) 27" (30" with borders) Apple Thunderbolt Display with a VESA mount adapter attached - because the monitor once had a cool looking curved aluminum base that was compatible with nothing else on the planet.
4,I saw a review of a guy saying he did an easy mod and used an Allan wrench and a regular wrench to reverse the back hooks so that the display can tilt back further. Did this and highly recommend it. The only downside is it doesn't include the tools needed for this. An Allan wrench is included but it is only the right size on the screws needed for assembly.
5,If you are considering making this purchase DO IT! I'm so in love with Working from Home so I have been slowly adapting my desk space to truly fit into my current home in the best ways possible.Cut to me scrolling Amazon after making the decision that my 2 24 in. ViewSonic Monitors with my 16 in. laptop from left to right was causing one of my monitors to hang over the edge of my 55 in. desk (another Amazon find!) & after discussing the impact of losing space for a bookshelf with a few colleagues they shared how they use one of their monitors in Portrait mode.When I worked in the office I used to think "how do people genuinely work with one Monitor in up/down position vs. horizontally." Now I know how-- and it's the best thing I ever did through the use of this Monitor stand!Not only was it a BREEZE to put together (because I didn't have to latch anything onto my desk using clamps etc. thanks to the monitor being freestanding) but it was a breeze to put it in the position of my preference: *PORTRAIT* mode!I no longer have my monitor hanging from the edge of my desk and with Portrait mode I feel as if I have gained two monitors out of the one (4 if I am feeling spicy) since I can have my email on the top of the monitor & multiple smaller programs beneath my email/calendar.The glass bottom itself is beautiful & much more visually appealing than the stand that came with the monitors. (Plural on monitors because I may just purchase a 2nd one to give myself half of a foot of my room back by downgrading to a smaller desk now! Living in a smaller home doesn't afford much space & optimizing is key.The stand truly supports the weight of the ViewSonic Monitor well (as anyone who has one knows they are substantially heavy; the stands that came WITH the monitors are not anywhere near as sturdy as this stand.)My package arrived safe & sound with multple screw options an allen wrench. Another amazing Amazon find for the books.
4,This works well but I wish the base could be a bit wider. Its installed on a 32" curved monitor.  It keeps it upright but would be more comfortable if the base was wider.
5,I bought this for a monitor I got that didn't have a stand and its been excellent so far. No issues and having the swivel feature is invaluable due to my setup.
5,This stand was a great purchase.  Simple to put together and adjust. Super solid base and looks great on my desk to handle my 32inch Sony monitor.  Highly recommend.
5,For reference the monitor I have mounted is a Samsung 27" CF398 Curved LED Monitor that weights 7.93 lbs without the stand and uses a 75mm x 75mm wall mounting size bracket.Also worth mentioning if you plan on using this on portrait mode make sure it's a monitor that is pre-threaded for mounting in the middle if the mounting threads are off center I would only recommend for landscape mode.I will start with the only negative I have tomention and that is that to rotate your screen vertically (as I'm using mine in the picture) you have to premeditatedly mount the monitor in that position there's no rotation mechsnism.This stand is very sturdy and easy to assemble. The base comes with very effective rubber feet you have to paste and can be placed on either side of the base (I chose the least glossy side to avoid reflections.) From there everything is very much a straight line from point A to point B. There's a screw you need to unscrewed if you would like to change the height of the monitor that can seems like a chore to a few but the idea is that makes your monitor more secure and that is something you can't put a price on.I appreciate the included cable management that while simple was effective and accommodating for multiple cables of multiple sizes. Also appreciated is the fact this mount comes with a good combination of screws and washers to accommodate many screen mounting formats which is definitely a good thing when the customer base could possibly be very wide.This stand is good for anyone who wants to replace the factory mount of their monitor which tend to be unorganized and inconvenient to place in a desk something this mount does well with a rectangular base with the added bonus you can switch to a vertical (portrait) format.I will be recommending this mount to anyone moving forward.
5,Amazing and sturdy stands. Brought 2 for my partner and it's wins all around!
5,This thing does what I wanted it to do. It gives me the ability to set the height up on my extended monitor so I can work with my lap top
5,Fantastic product. No hole drilling and ruining your desk etc. The monitor can be height adjusted and swiveled from left to right over a reasonably big angle. For this price this is a fantastic product that does everything that you could ask of it. Lastly the finish and appearance is top notch.
5,It’s great
5,This is the second product I've bought from this company! It is surprisingly easy to assemble with many options to "get it right" for your monitor! Would highly recommend it!
4,I use it for my second monitor on my gaming setup it’s nice kinda wobbles a bit but nothing too crazy
5,I don't like gaming monitor stands so I got this. Very happy.
5,Well made and is adjustable.
5,It’s very easy to assemble and it hold very well. Strongly recommend
5,If I could put it together you probably can too
5,I got this so that I could change my 23" monitor from landscape to portrait easily & it works well.  Great for spreadsheets & long documents.
4,Great stuff
4,I was looking at and buying this just because I wanted some extra height for an old monitor I had laying around. It had a basic tilt mount that gave the monitor about 2 inches of height standard for most cheap monitors. It has a VESA mounting option though so I thought a better mount could at least get me some height.At first blush this was heavier than I was expecting. Glass and metal usually IS heavy but this was thicker than I expected. I'm used to a certain amount of "shake" and "wiggle" from monitors as I type but I was surprised to see this reduced it even from what the previous tilt mount allowed. Much more stable than I was expecting which was a welcome sight.Assembly isn't too bad but make sure you follow the instructions and plan out what height you'd like it at. You can't really switch it on the fly (the height) but you can adjust the tilt some without having to dismount the monitor. If you don't need to change the monitor height constantly this really doesn't become much of an issue. If you have a VERY specific height you need the monitor at it may be troublesome but it has about 4 or so adjustment levels so it's not like you get min or max and that's it. It has the option to rotate the screen but I dont use that so I can't really comment on it.This is great for any monitor that is still serviceable but needs a decent mount. MAKE SURE YOUR MONITOR IS VESA MOUNT COMPATIBLE!! This should fit any of the standard monitor ones so no sweat there. Take your time assembling it and it should serve you well. I liked it so much I bought another one!!
5,The stand was sturdy stable and adjustablei'm able to tilt it as i need it and it works really well
4,I bought this same stand two years ago to match my glass case. It matched perfectly and I have no complaints. Recently I bought a second monitor and wanted matching stands. However I noticed it’s not quite as nice as my first. The original had Velcro straps on the back to secure wires. This one just has one sized plastic clips so you can’t bundle the wires tight. The second thing I noticed was the edge of the glass base isn’t polished anymore. It’s more of a dull cut glass edge now which isn’t shiny like the top of the glass like the original one I purchased.  And finally but also the most trivial is the plastic piece at the top of the stand doesn’t have their logo stamped into it like it use too. All in all none of those things would make me not buy it again but just disappointed they skimped out a bit on some of the quality. Still if you’re on the fence it’s a fantastic stand for the money.
5,Very easy to install. I used some twist screws I bought before it arrived not realizing it would come with hardware. It appears very sturdy holding up my 24 inch insignia TV.
5,I got this to free up some space on my desk and to lift up my monitor to eye level. It accomplishes both tasks wonderfully. I wasn't aware that the base was glass when I bought it but it arrived in perfect condition and looked amazing when I put it together. The stand makes it really easy to change the hight of the monitor with how easy it is to detach the bracket from the stand. The mount also came with just about any screw you could possibly need.The only issue that I had with this was more of an issue with my monitor not having all the mounting holes the right depth. Nothing the stand could have done to fix that and easy enough for me to fix on my own.The monitor smoothly changes angles when adjusted and stays where you leave it. The wide base also keeps the entire thing anchored in place with no unwanted movement.
5,Amazing. Works perfectly and easy to assemble
5,As most of us early into the pandemic I bought whatever I could find to WFH in this case a 29" LG monitor and an adjustable base which was quite chunky.Now that I am back to the office I am trying to reduce the space on the home office and this thing was just what I needed height is perfect and so it is there sturdiness which was my main concern.Note that it is not as fancy as the other top brand height and tilt the height adjustment is manual and tilt is a bit limited but anyways I guess most of us do not need all that right?It is easy to assemble no more than 5 mins and your desk will look amazing.
4,I needed a new computer desk and the current monitor I use (in title) has a very hard stand for fitting on monitor shelves.. So I needed to get a stand that could hold the heft of it without falling over. This stand is exactly what I was looking for!The only downsides are the Asus rog strix 27" monitor will not fit in portrait position on this stand; Even at highest setting..Big deal; I don't use that.. and you have to take out a bolt in the back to adjust the height you want (my highest position needed to be re-threaded due to a manufacturing error) Other than that? Perfection. The swivel and tilt functions are hassle-free and more than accommodating for any standard needs.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Im a streamer and this helps alot with reading chat
4,Pricing is good. The way to tilt is a little strange but it's easy to get used to. Base was heavier than I thought (which was good)  the slight elevation with the bottom nubs helps with keeping the two base screws from scratching the desk but I still wrapped them in those carpet pad things for furniture just in case. :)Will update in 1-3 months on how well it works.
4,I bought this stand to replace the one that comes with my Samsung monitor that's really cheap and flimsy. Spec says it only supports up to 32" but I think that's only relevant if you plan to rotate to portrait mode (too tall).  I installed it on my 34" Samsung in landscape mode and it works fine.  The base is heavy and steady.  The vertical arm takes some effort to mount to the base but no big deal.  Overall i really like the compactness and steadiness.
3,The screws I needed to use were small enough that the mount on the monitor would move around so I improvised and put electrician tape on the screws to the monitor mount did not jiggle.Everything else on this stand was well thought and very robust.  The bottom plate is a very heavy coated shiny steel plate that I am sure will never tip over.  So for a universal monitor mount this product works very well and if in the future I need something like this because I failed to save the monitor mounts again I would buy this product again.  I am a real person who lives in California
3,Nice sturdy stand that was easy to put together.  The front top glass came with a cosmetic blemish that I had to scrape off with a knife.  It was a hard white residue.  It was not glue but more like glass.  I would have returned it but I did not have time.
3,It can only tilt swivel and rotate. It's missing a vertical adjustment and a z-axis forward and backward adjustment. If you're looking for an all-in-one monitor stand skip this product and anything like it. I will still keep it since it still does it job.
5,Purchased for a ultra wide LG monitor and it holds great. Assembly is very simple and straightforward but all of the screws pre-assembled vesa-mount were incredibly loose. Must tighten a bit before mounting any screen to stem/base
3,does not work with a 32" in portrait as advertisedangle is too steep for my preferencereturning and hoping to find a better product
4,I have a 27" Alienware 2721D monitor and the massive stand it came with held the monitor too close to my face.Since I didn't want a permanent wall mount I opted for this Hemudu desk stand mount. I was nervous it wouldn't fit underneath the cabinet above my desk but it's only about 16.5" tall and fit fine. However with my 27" monitor mounted I could only use the bottom two heights on the stand. It's fine but about an inch lower would have been perfection.As you can see from my before and after photos this stand allowed me to gain about three more inches of distance from my monitor compared to the stand that came with my Alienware monitor.  Although this is certainly not a sturdy the benefit of viewing comfort makes it worthwhile.My main concern is that a small thumb screw is holding my monitor at the desired angle. Even though my monitor is only about 14 lb the single screw seems to be straining and I worry that it could break and droop (or drop!) my monitor.An additional thumb screw would be my suggestion for making this more substantial. I cannot fathom it could hold a 77 lb device as advertised and I certainly would not trust it with a device of that weight.Overall the black glass base is aesthetically fantastic and the rest of the stand is decent but could use improvements in sturdiness of the attachments and additional height adjustments.  One idea would be to add a second set of height adjustments on the back of the vertical stand piece and it could be flipped to that side depending on the customer's screen size.
5,I did some looking and read tons of reviews on numerous stands. After careful consideration I purchased  Model # HT05B-001.I needed to be careful of the mounting bracket type and of course the size and how much weight it will hold to use with my Echo Show 15.  I wanted a solid stand that would not tip over. Thanks to all the reviews from gamers who use larger monitors. They were right!This stand works great! I am supper happy with me selection and would highly recommend it.The base is black glass and looks nice in any space. It is really sturdy and easy to put together.  It swivels tilts (only slightly) you can rotate to use a vertical or horizontal application and it is manually height adjustable. Oh and it comes with all the hardware for several mounting options. Couldn't be easier.Check it out for yourself!  It's a a solid choice!
5,Bought two of these used. I do recommend buying this new if you don't mind the few extra bucks. The first one I received was great pretty much new. The second one was pretty bad with the bottom part slightly stained/bleached somehow and the feet having to be reattached with superglue.The stands look great and are very sturdy. Holds up my 24" monitor with no problems. Actually surprised my monitor hasn't wobbled whenever I mash my keyboard.
5,This stand is mounted to a 27" LG monitor. Can't swivel but that was low on my bucket list anyway.  VERY stable and addresses the height I need.  Great value!
5,I needed a monitor stand that would allow me to quickly pull out my laptop for Zoom meetings.  Stands with legs would catch the cables and the cantilever style stands were not high enough.  This one is PERFECT.  Very easy to assemble/install very sturdy & /table.  The only negative is that it doesn’t telescope; there are five different height settings.  However that doesn’t warrant a lower score because the middle setting is the perfect height for me.
5,I bought this to allow me to setup one my monitors to a portrait position. It's sturdy and has a large base so there isn't any risk of it tipping over somehow. It's not super easy to adjust so I would recommend this more for someone who has their monitor in a fixed position.
4,I am so glad I spent a few dollars extra on this stand (for LG Monitor 27MN60T). After reading reviews for some cooler looking stand I decided for this one that had better reviews althoug it was a little pricier. I couldn't visualize the titlting and turnig from looking at the pictures. Even when I unpacked it seemed odd like it wouldn't do well. After mounting my monitor I was surprised to see how well it worked!! Gave only 4 starts because the scews were a tad too long for my monitor but I used the extra washers so the screws wouldn't go all the way in. Otherwise is perfect.
5,This was perfect to adjust the height of my computer monitor and take the stress off my neck and back.
4,I originally wanted a monitor arm however I could not find one that would work with my desk and let me be confident about it. I also did not want to put more holes in my wall so I settled for a vesa monitor stand instead. Which I am pleasantly happy with. The things I wanted most were achieved. Height and monitor being as far back on the desk as possible. I am fairly tall my desk is tall  and when I play PC games I sit in my chair at max height.The stock monitor stand for my Viotek gnv34dbe (34" ultrawide) was annoying low with little to no adjustment other than a little tilt. . So when gaming I would have to tilt my head down which of course would cause cramps. With this monitor stand I have it at the very top. There is almost enough room for my google pixel 4 xl to stand under the monitor.The only reasons I gave this stand 4 out of 5 stars is for 1 there's a scuff that at the time of this writing  I am unsure if I will be able to get it out of the glass base. And 2 I appreciate the cable management option (Velcro ties) but they just do not work for my monitor. My monitor has a shroud around where the cables plug into so I am not able to route them behind the stand to utilize the ties. I can someone use the bottom on but it is not worth the hassle.Other than that I would buy the monitor again and I would recommend it.(Do note if you are using this stand for portrait mode using anything over a 27" will not work. Especially if your vesa location is low on your monitor instead of center. Your mileage may vary.)
4,Seems like a quality product for the price as far as materials are concerned. The base is heavy and doesn't wobble and the added Velcro straps behind the vertical bar are a nice touch for cable management.  Comes with a bunch of different screws/washer types for securing onto the VESA holes.  HOWEVER...I needed to bring out my additional tool set to adjust numerous points on the mount itself particularly with screws relating to swivel options in ALL directions.  Most were very loose and even the hand tightening knob wasn't enough for the monitor to feel secure with a 'firm' or 'grippy' feel while rotating my 27" monitor.  Although it will still hold well enough out-of-the-box I'm surprised I haven't run into any reviews mentioning this.Also as another reviewer had mentioned which I think its worth noting if you like your monitor closer to the wall to increase the viewing distance from the monitor this stand isn't gong to give you much distance and for my 27" monitor it comes right up to my face even when putting the stand on the very back edge of my desk. Seems like a lot of wasted desk space. For a standard size desk (about 24" depth) this may be too close for some (will give you about 24-27" eye to display distance).  I guess the good thing about that for my situation is that it gives me space to plug in my HDMI cable and power cable given that the inputs are smack in the middle of my monitor and in-line with the vertical mount pole.  Something to consider.Overall I'm happy and the mount looks sleek.  I'll get used to the distance.
5,well worth the price
3,Monitor tilt downward is very generous however the tilt upward which most people need is very limited. I was going to buy a 2nd stand for my 2nd monitor but not now.  I have had to put erasers under the front of the base in order to get the upward tilt needed.
5,This stand works beautifully to raise my monitor to a more comfortable position. I’ve got a vintage desk that necessitated a raised monitor in order for me not to have to look down at it. It’s sturdy and solid and is easy to rotate into the desired position. And the stand comes with a few nice rubber protectors so my desk top won’t get scratched. And it only took about 10mins to put together.It comes with two bags of materials - the long bag you’ll just have to figure out which size screws and washers your monitor/tv requires to attach the VESA bracket - the rest are extras as they’ve generously supplied multiple options for the different varieties of monitors/tvs. Other than that it’s a quick and easy assembly. Just follow the diagrams and it’s good to go. I’m very happy with this product.
5,Muy confiable estable y por su precio me encantó
5,This thing is really sturdy when you put it together. The only hard part was screwing any of the size screws they give you. I had to cut the plastic pieces that comes with this stand down to size just so the screws could fit in the back of my monitor. I hope this helps anyone who may get discouraged or frustrated about the screws not fitting! If it works it works!
5,I've been spoiled over the years buying only Dell Pro monitors and stands I've been used to being able to firmly push the monitor up and down side to side tilt up and down and push down on one side in order to rotate it all can be don in just a few second .  This isn't that the   AmazonBasics K001575         can do that if you have a small enough monitor (I didn't like how much it stick out the back so I didn't buy it) but it's $20 more and that's a point against the AmazonBasics product.  I attached this to the Acer VG270K (it's a 27" monitor it's about 11 lbs) and it's a major improvement of the wobbly stand it came with it took me about 15 minutes to follow the assembly and attach the monitor once everything was all said and done I had a more attractive and way more sturdy setup for my monitor.  You can move it side to side and rotate without adjusting anything where I have this set right now it's holding the monitor pretty firmly which I prefer.  Tilting up and down does require loosening a bit on the back before adjusting and tightening.  Sadly it took me about a minute to move the monitor to a different height you have to unscrew a long screw unhook the VESA part move it down and tighten.  It's not the end of the world for me if you need this to be faster you may want to consider the   HUANUO Swivel Universal Single Monitor Stand         which I haven't tried.  I think this monitor stand has the hooks since it's rated for 77 pounds so hopefully this review helps you decide.Overall this is a great monitor stand I'm quite pleased with it.
5,Quick and easy assemble and rock solid! I use 2 of them in different sizes one for the 42" monitor and a smaller one for the 27" I have in portrait mode. They are super easy to adjust for viewing angle ad orientation. I will soon be adding g a 3rd one to hold an additional 27" on the left. The bases are heavy-duty tempered glass which are easy to clean and also great for mounting such items as USB hubs etc with a bit of double-sided tape.
3,Bought 2 stands I'm going to return one. I got 2x27inch Asus monitors and 2 of these stands. Got the first monitor on the stand and tested the rotation. It couldn't hold the weight of the monitor and would fall crooked. I setup one of my old (smaller) monitors on the stand and it works well enough but now I don't need the second one. For the most part the stand is solid and looks nice easy to assemble. Just keep the above in mind.
5,This was very simple to put together and easy to read instructions. I really like the glass bottom. It seems to be sturdy there were a couple screws that make me nervous. The 2 bottom screws holding the mount to the monitor did not screw in all the way but holding together nicely and tight. There is a bolt on the mount that is loose it does not tighten but I think it’s like that for a reason. If you buy it you will understand. I do recommend buying this! This stand is very nice. Plus I love the clips they give you for the wires.
4,Half of the instructions from the manual were missing.
5,Perfect for my 27” monitor. The different size screw options made it quick and convenient to assemble.
5,So happy to own this Vesa mount.
5,This stand is great for a smaller desk it has a small footprint and is very adjustable.
4,I just wanted a sturdy monitor stand to replace a poor-quality one that came with a monitor that I recently purchased.  This one exceeded expectations for sturdiness.  Assembly was fairly simple and the instructions were decent.  The design of this unit makes it difficult to adjust height once the monitor is installed but unless you need to do that it is otherwise a very sturdy stand that should last for many years.
4,I just got this today to set up my second monitor and it's really sturdy. Assembling it was easy the only thing I would have to mention is the feet that come with it will leave a black mark on a mousepad if you were to put it on top of one but that's an easy fix. Its glass base is really nice to look and adjusting it was easy the height is kinda tedious to change but I don't need to constantly change the height of the monitor so it doesn't bother me. Very solid stand!
5,I've used several of this company's products in different sizes. All work great!
5,This worked perfectly. I was afraid my monitor would be too heavy but it wasnt! Easily adjustable and the clips in the back are perfect for multiple dangling cords.
4,Very sturdy and flexible monitor stand.  Will hold up to any use.  Just budget a bit of time to assemble the kit.  Worth it!
3,This is a high quality stand and should work perfectly for anyone that wants to view their monitor in landscape mode.  It did not work out for mounting my monitor in portrait mode.The stand was easy to assemble and came with all necessary hardware (including spacers) to attach to the VESA mount.  The materials are all sturdy and high quality looking especially the glass base plate.  I also really like the rubber feet that protect my desk surface.  The swivel and tilt work very well too.The only problem is that I wanted to mount my Samsung 28" monitor in portrait mode.  Admittedly it is likely caused by the design of my monitor.  The VESA mount is located above the vertical center (see photo) when the monitor is positioned horizontally.My monitor is too large to simply rotate while on the stand (a minor disappointment).  When I removed it from the stand and set it on the stand in portrait mode the weight is unevenly distributed and the monitor tilts/rotates toward the heavy side.  I did prop the heavy side up to keep it even but that isn't something I want to do permanently.  I'll be looking for a different stand that has a locking mechanism to keep it at a 90 degree rotation despite the uneven weight.
5,I have a Viewsonic 22" quality monitor mounted on it.  Took me about 10 minutes to put it together.  It took me longer than that to take off the Viewsonic base.  Very sturdy.  I particularly like the fact that it doesn't protrude much in the  back to take up my sweetheart's desk space.  They include a bunch of sets of screws to match up with a variety of monitor VESA mounting holes.  The tilt adjustment is very easy to set and lock.  I won't be using the rotate but that might be important for some. It can be mounted at four different heights.  I'm using the top one so it will clear access to my desk phone but it could easily be made the same height as the next monitor to it's left.  It will only take a few minutes to disassemble for travel.  I think I'll be getting another of these for my travel monitor.  I can't find anything to complain about.**UPDATE**This has worked well enough that I have since added two more for additional monitors.  One is a Westinghouse 25" monitor and the other is an Acer 27" monitor.  I"m using the bottom and the 2nd from the bottom spots for these two monitors that allow for clearance under the above the desk shelf.  I highly recommend these monitor stands.
5,Compre un monitor con base fija y quería una Base que me diera: Altura con varios niveles de ajuste Material resistente que pueda soportar peso y movimientos fuertes. Este producto brinda todo esto y mucho mas ya que puedes tener 4 niveles diferentes de ajuste donde tu cabeza se pueda acomodar mejor dependiendo del escritorio que utilices aparte no se mueve ni un poco al contario de otras bases que van perdiendo altura o no se puede inclinar porque esta si trae tanto para altura como para declinar y inclinar la pantalla. Yo utilizo en un monitor de 27 pulgadas y va excelente. Recomiendo este producto 100%.
5,Durable stand easy to assemble. Would buy it again
5,This stand is an absolute beast! The original stand that came with my Samsung G5 34" Ultrawide was wobbly made of cheap plastic and had no adjustment abilities. This thing covers every aspect you could ask for and more!Not only is it more than capable of holding up a 34" Ultrawide monitor but it looks good doing it! The adjustments are easy and weightless. Some people mentioned issues with the height adjustment being a pain and while I agree I like having the ability to set the height I want and not worry about it falling or slowly sliding down.The tempered glass is beautiful and the velcro attachments on the back are a nice addition for minor cable management. It also came with a large option of screws for a wide range of installations. I ended up using the provided rubber spacers although I didn't need them it was just nice to not put the metal bracket directly on the monitor.I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a monitor stand for anything up to a 34" Ultrawide Monitor. The only thing to be aware of is that if you use it for this size of monitor you will not be able to put it in the vertical position due to the size of the monitor.
5,I was a little hesitant about this stand due to how cheap it was but man I was very impressed extremly straight forward to assemble and wasnt missing any parts comes with the tool you need.  I mounted my 27" monitor to it and it is very stable the glass bottom is heavy enough to keep it from tipping at all and very adjustable.
5,Was looking for a good quality sturdy monitor stand for a vertical monitor. This did the job well. it does not shake unlike my others.
5,Its good.
3,The stand is find it holds up my monitor but i was under the impression it would be easy to adjust the height while it's in front of me. . .unless you have nothing behind your desk it's not that simple.You're going to have to pull your monitor forward to get behind it unscrew the support screw in the back pickup your monitor out of the height holes you're on and adjust accordingly. ..  then screw the support screw back into place and put your monitor / stand back to it's original position.No easy sliding your monitor up & down where it sits. Other than that it's very sturdy was easy to put together & came with several mount screw sizes. I am able to tilt it slightly side to side & up and down. . . but to adjust height is several steps.
5,Love it. Put them together myself. I was looking for something sleek instead of the bulky dual stand I had. This is perfect
5,Listen. I usually hate writing reviews but I liked them so much I got two of them. I bought one last October when I got a new monitor and now in May I got a 3rd monitor and immediately ordered another one. Holding two 22” vertical monitors and works perfectly. :)
4,I've been on the hunt for a monitor stand that can support my MSI 34" ultrawide monitor since the original sits too low and has no adjustment whatsoever. I was slightly worried about this stand since it only supports monitors up to 32" but it claims to hold up to ~70lbs. This made me more confident since mine is roughly 22lbs.First impressions:The build quality didn't blow me away and the packaging was very cheap. The instructions were simply illustrations but were simple to follow.Assembly: I believe once I decided how high I wanted my monitor assembly only took about 5 minutes. I don't like that  the rubber feet on the bottom of the base aren't pre-applied but at lease if you scratch up the top of the glass base you can flip it over and buy some new rubber feet to make it look like new.Concerns:The only concern I have with this monitor is that if you give the monitor stand a slight push from behind the monitor and stand can tip forward. If you have a sharp mechanical keyboard on your desk like me that's a good way to kill your display. I have my desk against the wall so the only thing that might tip the monitor over from behind could be a curious cat. Perhaps moving the rubber feet that are on the side closest to you to the edge will help distribute the weight better to prevent tipping. If something else happens like the mount breaking and dropping my expensive display I will give an update.
5,This was easy to assemble - they give you a bunch of different screw sizes to fit as many monitor backsides as possible. I bought a 24 inch monitor for my desk which has very limited space. By raising the monitor I now have more space on the desktop and even though it doesn't fit on my standing desk riser I can still see and read what's on the additional monitor. I am buying another for my left side monitor. It's a no-brainer.
2,I purchased this stand to replace a fixed flimsy stand that came with my recently purchased 27-inch computer monitor.  When typing and I do a lot of it the monitor would jiggle from side to side constantly which is very annoying.The stand was easy enough to put together and it is sturdy but it really would benefit from another row of height adjustment slots.  My monitor is sitting on the lowest row and it is still too high to hit the comfort sweet spot.I believe this is more suited for a TV rather than a computer monitor. As a monitor stand it just doesn’t provide enough flexibility. I’ll keep it but wouldn’t buy it again.  I suggest others look elsewhere for something more versatile as an upgrade.  There are plenty of other choices out there.  I just managed to buy this not-so-perfect one.
5,Fanastic monitor stand for my Acer 27". Simple design(nice to see a square base) and sturdy. Well pleased with this one.
5,This center pedestal solved my problem of monitor placement.The ability to adjust height and angle were an added bonus!👍👍
4,I would have given 5 stars but there was one thing that I was unsatisfied about and that was a screw in the back that was not completely on right. There was a screw in the back that was kind of loose. It kind of made my screen a little wobbly when trying to turn it. Otherwise the stand keep my screen up it did not take much time to assemble and it does not take too much space on my table. Overall I like it.
4,Let me get the only snag out of the way...HEIGHT ADJUSTABLE - LET ME CLARIFY WHAT THEY MEAN BY 5 HOLESI made an incorrect assumption about the height adjustability. It is not like a button you push to unlock it and slide it to another of the four adjustable locking points. You must unscrew a large pin while holding the monitor so it doesn't fall down lift or lower the monitor to line up the holes on the new height and re-insert the screw. You know it's basically that pin in the hole method. So don't plan on adjusting the height on the fly. The way they describe it on this page does not make this completely clear.This method of adjustment isn't terrible.  You just need to know it's going to take a couple of minutes to do it and you need to have a hold of your monitor. The screw has a handle and it's easy to tighten/loosen. See photos.It's well built.  Solid materials. The velcro straps are the only cheap parts of this stand. It comes with plenty of screws and instructions that work. The base is a basic chunk of thick black glass the arm is metal.I used the 100mm VESA mount on the back of my Pixio PX275h 27" monitor to connect to this stand. No problems.Considering the price this is a good buy and meets my expectations (...except that height adjustment one).
5,Exceeded my expectations. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.
5,I bought a pair of monitors 5-6 years ago for use with an Ergotron arm system so I never installed the stands that came with them.  They went straight onto the 100mm VESA mount on my Ergotron and I was happy.  Cycle forward to a month or so ago when I bought a 49" ultrawide display.  I had to leave one of the old monitors up so one came off of the Ergotron and got put into storage.  My wife occasionally works from home and wanted to have a monitor at home to use w/ her laptop... and there's my problem.  I had a perfectly good monitor out in storage but no stand for it!  Amazon to the rescue!For $25 this product is BEEFY!  I put my 24" IPS monitor on it (10 minutes of assembly) and it doesn't even wiggle a bit.  I wouldn't have any qualms putting a 30" on it.  The base is a super-heavy piece of glass or plexi with a metal arm and fittings.  It allows monitor rotation and maybe 10-20 degrees of tilt.  Height is also adjustable.  They send you all of the hardware to assemble the mount plus an allen key / screwdriver and an assortment of screws that should fit whatever monitor you have.  The holes lined up perfectly for my VESA 100 monitor.
5,I loved this stand it holds my (decade) old very heavy Hp 27" monitor the assembly couldn't be any simpler I'd say it takes less than 5 minutes tops to assemble and hang the monitor but I'm not American. For Americans it takes 30 minutes to read the instructions another 30min to gather the tools and wear gloves and eye protection and 1 hour to assemble. After that they take 5 minutes to review an item that it's perfectly well made and sturdy and bash it saying that the instructions were not clear the mount is not strong enough and finally that probably a washer they lost in the process "was not included in the sealed package.I do recommend this stand for anyone normal who might need it.
3,Arg! I was so excited to get this monitor stand. I set it all up only to realize that it doesn’t move the monitor up and down. 😞
4,It’s sturdy. Also the fact that you need to take the monitor out and move it to a different vertical position is annoying. I find it necessary to change its vertical position every time I rotate it since the monitor hits the desk otherwise. However I find myself needing to rotate it so seldom that this is not a big deal. It’s fairly easy to move it to a different slot. Just don’t drop the monitor.
3,We bought two. One was great. The other looked like it had been used for years. Parts were missing glass stand was full of hair and the cushioned feet were on the wrong side which we had to gently remove and the thoroughly clean the grime and grease off of.Not happy.Amazon was helpful but disappointed that this passed any inspection for resale.
3,The concept is good the execution is not so good.  The vertical options aren't really adequate to personalize individual needs.  Construction of the individual parts are not carefully machined.  There are better options.
4,Overall this stand is quite solid but it does not have the range I hoped for. It's significantly better than the stand that came with my LG monitor but it still doesn't extend as tall as I need it to for good ergonomics. For reference I'm about 6 ft tall so when I sit and especially when I stand the monitor is not high enough even on the tallest stand setting for me to look straight ahead at the screen. For this reason I have it on a box that is about double the height of the stand. That is my main complaint; if you are shorter this stand might be perfect. I'm going to try out a monitor arm to see if that will give me the height I need.One other note: While the base of the stand is quite heavy there are some parts included that are made of plastic that I think will be fine for a few years but would likely break over time with usage. That being said I would still buy this stand if it worked for my height.
5,I used this for my 27 inch IMAC.  installation is just few minutes and very easy.  Stand delivered in 24 hours.
4,I was looking the replace a LG monitor stand which had many reviews of it snapping and I came across this stand. Assembly was a little daunting at first with all the parts but you won’t have to use all the screws. It comes with little rubber feet that attach to the bottom of the stand. I felt that they were cheap and fell off easily so I threw those out. Other than those issues the stand is perfect. It feels sturdy and has a nice metal construction. I love how you can tilt it multiple ways to configure it to your needs.
5,i like this stand's square bottom than the others' V shaped stand. I believe its metal very smooth to touch and ascetically pleasing to look at.I bought this stand hoping to turn my 27in monitor into portrait. i turned out to not like the setup that much (for anyone thinking about a portrait mode setup use something like a 22/24in; also dont use TN as your already bad vertical viewing angle will be way worse turning to portrait's horizontal viewing angle) but this stand can just barely accommodate a 27in portrait. With a tilt it also can barely rotate back to landscape without unmounting first.setup was easy. the height adjustment on this stand is not a slider like the dell monitors have but rather a hook. still very efficient and reliable this thing stands as a solid rock.Package offers a variety of mounting screws; mine works with the smallest ones and now i have to make sure not to lose them in the storage. Im sure it will mostly fit your monitors or tv's; if not you'll get the awkward apology from the instructions.Overall its a solid stand; if i have more cash to dump i would upgrade my other monitor into this stand. I think ~$30 is the norm for single monitor stands then this would be a great buy. Now to think about it the vesa mount arm one might fit my needs better but this stand can also do the trick.
4,Overall a good stand. I needed something with a shallow footprint and at 8" or so this works perfectly. The stand is stable and easy to put together and supports my new ultrawide 29" screen just fine. The one drawback is that the mechanism that attaches the monitor to the stand is quite deep which means that even though the stand part is all the way at the back of the 8" deep base the monitor is pretty much even with the front edge of the stand. This puts the monitor about 4 inches close to my face than my old setup and it feels a little too close. I guess I'll get used to it but I do wish it was a thinner mechanism that let the monitor set back a few inches more.
5,It works.
2,Let's do this in two parts the actual stand and the experience with an Amazon "Used-Very Good Condition" product.The stand itself seems quite sturdy and holds one of my 24" Samsung monitors in portrait mode quite nicely. Goes together easily. As has been noted the vertical adjustment is rather primitive but it works. The VESA bracket handles 50 75 and 100 mm spacing.The experience with a "Used-Very Good Condition" product was rather less satisfactory. I don't mind that the stand had some small scratches. I do mind that close to half the hardware was missing including all the M4 screws used for mounting the bracket to you monitor as well as one of the large bolts used to hold the actual bracket together. Fortunately I have some metric stuff laying around the shop and could kludge it together well enough to use it. A trip to the hardware store will be necessary to make the fixes permanent.I should have purchased the new item and spent the $4-5. Lesson learned.
5,Stand will rotate a 24 inch monitor to portrait mode (could be more if placed at a greater height) the chief need for this stand.  Very sturdy very easy to rotate even had a Philips screw driver head on the cheapo provided wrench which was great for an office environment where tools are not easily found.  It was perfectly workable and saved me time looking for a screwdriver.  I think they gave you everything you'd need for any situation in the package including several different sizes of washers and screws for the VESA mount.  I had the VESA screws from my previous stand that wouldn't rotate vertically for the 24 inch monitor but the ones sent in the package were much nicer.  This is a fantastic value.In hindsight I wish I had spent more to get a monitor stand that moves up and down instead of changing the height via hooks.  I realized later I really need the top of the portrait monitor to align with the top of the landscape monitor and I can't adjust the height precisely enough for them to line up.  Still I'm happy enough with this purchase that I'm looking for a scrap 10"x15"x.5"  board to address that issue as my landscape monitor stand can move up or down.
3,I replaced the original stand my 24" Alienware monitor came with with this stand to save desk space.Good:- it is reasonably well made- it is easy to assemble- It holds the monitorNot so good:- there is no way to fixate the tilt and rotation so any time my cats walk by they will tilt or turn my monitor- adjusting height is a pain it requires you to unscrew a plastic bolt from the back lift the monitor carefully re-seat all four catches into their new slots and then screw the plastic screw back in while holding the monitor because the screw doesn't fit exactly and would not go in with the monitor just hanging there- the angle control is kinda junky and I am not sure how well it will hold over time- and again why the hell is there a way to fixate the angle but not to fixate tilt? Do people really tilt their monitors all the time? I don't want to have to straighten up my monitor all the time.
5,There are very few parts involved with assembling this stand. The vesa mount is simple and enough screws are included to chose the size that's right for your assembly. When assembled its got enough weight to it to hold my monitors with confidence. I have used it for my bulky 24in HP monitors and for a 27in iMac with a vesa mount adapter.
5,I bought this to put a 32" Vizio Smart TV in our guest bedroom since the bureau that we wanted to put it on wasn't wide enough to support the feet supplied with the TV.  From opening the box to actually mounting the TV took me maybe 15 minutes and all required screws and washers were provided.  Very sturdy and secure plus the swivel provides a much better solution than the small plastic feet which have actually broken on another TV.  I will buy this again when I replace another TV next year!
5,Es un muy buen producto elegante y sobrio. Si se tiene un monitor que llegue a las 27” o más es mejor mirar otra opción ya que no se podría usar el monitor de manera vertical.
3,Product was easy to assemble and setup. The only problem was there were no extra option to lower your Monitor and thus leaving my monitor way to up.
5,I bought this for a monitor that the stand cracked on. Dell monitor works great no issues. Everything to replace the stand came in the box. Great item so glad I got it.
5,This is a sturdy monitor stand that I bought so I could rig up a test station for computers.  It's strong easy to set up and well-priced.  Highly recommend.
5,Really well
4,Nice quality and assembled looks good.  A very sturdy construction - no worries that something will shift up or down.Here are some cons (product is still great no regrets of buying it but those could be improved):- construction could've allowed to position display one level higher.  I'm sure quality and material support this already.  I positioned display on the highest position and it's still a bit lower than needed and was before.  If there was one more position above - that would be perfect.- sticky rubber circles underneath slowly shift by display weight.  Had to lift the whole construction and move them back before they get squeezed out completely.  Probably will have to do that again once in a month.If you're looking for solid and nice construction - this is it.  I couldn't find more solid one that supports such weight.  If manufacturer would work on the points I mentioned it'll be perfect.
4,First time using this type of stand. Easy to assemble.  Good instructions.
5,Very glad that I found this monitor stand.  I have been looking for a low profile stand that looks good - and found it for a great price!  It really made my 27" monitor (LG 27GL850) much more manageable as the stock stand was large and honestly ugly.  This is a problem with so many gamer monitors in my opinion and most times the stand replacement options are pretty not good looking.  It is true that your ability to rotate into vertical mode is limited on larger monitors so if that is an issue for you look elsewhere.  My other observation is that the tilt range is pretty limited and it just barely  tilts to a level I like.  I'm pretty good with where it is at.Also of note which I was really glad to discover is the stand itself while tempered glass has two finishes - one finish is glossy and the other is a much more matte finish.  I have the matte finish showing the upside and it feels like a good upscale piece of equipment.For this price it is hard to beat the value offered.
5,I was very glad to find this item.  I damaged the stand for my HP Z1 [Gen1] and needed an aftermarket solution due to the fact that replacement stands from HP were not available.  The Z1 is quite heavy because it is an all-in-one design so I also needed to make sure I found a stand that could support more weight than a typical HDTV or PC monitor.  Since HP used a VESA mount standard for the Z1 this stand proved to be an ideal budget-friendly solution.  The assembly was quick and easy.  I used the original mounting screws from the Z1 stand but the unit had several screws included as well.  I am extremely pleased with this stand and recommend it for any application but especially for those who might have a Z1 or other all-in-one PC in need of a new stand that can handle the size and weight.
5,Didnt take too long to assemble. Didnt get a headache from the instructions.  Looks like the picture listed.  Seems sturdy. No one here is a gamer so cant say anything  to that qaulity. A few more features that dont come with the original monitor stand. 5 stars only because it did what it was supose to. Weve had it 2 ir 3 months at this point. Used by a 11 year old
5,Quality product and very easy to assemble. It is great that they provide multiple screw types to match different monitor vendors.
5,I needed a little more monitor height so I could place a sound bar under the screen and this did the job. Since it's a monopole design you don't have to worry about how wide your soundbar or keyboard is -- both slide right under the monitor to free up workspace. Quality is excellent. Buy it!
5,Best stand I have seen in a while. Works great for me. The only problem I see is that the holes in the glass are too big. I added a nylon round spacer between the bolts and glass and it makes the connection nice and snug. Also I replaced the pass-through carriage bolt and added a wing nut for the tilt so both works great. Finally the VESA plate channel was bent too far out so I bent it square.
5,This is a great monitor. It’s sturdy and generally well thought out.
4,Shipping was fast and the stand arrived in perfect condition.  Materials were robust and the stand provides solid support for my 27 inch Acer monitor.The only issue I encountered was the limited upward tilt adjustment.  As designed this stand can tilt down 15 degrees and up 10 degrees.  There is also some looseness in the mechanism so in practice the upward tilt is a little less than 10 degrees maximum.  Since my system needed a little more upward tilt I did an easy mod to reverse the adjustment range.  The mount part that allows the monitor to swivel from side to side is held by an upper and lower bolt.  All I needed to do was remove those 2 bolts flip the part and re install the bolts.  This reversed the mount and now the stand allows a 15 degree up and 10 down adjustment.After the mod the mount works perfectly for me.
5,I have a slightly heavy monitor and this stand holds up great. Only slight issue is that if I bang my desk the monitor will tilt downwards but still great for the price!
5,I got this for a 32" Samsung 4k TV and it's just about perfect; I would prefer it could raise the TV just a couple more inches for better clearance with soundbars; the soundbar I had in mind will not work with this stand and my 32" TV because it will obscure the bottom part of the TV. The glass really gives it a nice elegant appearance. The stand was very easy to assemble. The swivel and tilt work nicely. I would just caution buyers to be careful when moving it. It doesn't take much pressure if you're not being careful to pop the top hook on the VESA mount out of the stand. I was moving it and put too much pressure on the TV while I was moving it and the top popped out and I almost dropped the TV. Otherwise it's very sturdy and stable and I am happy with it overall.
5,Used on a 32 inch monitor and the stability was perhaps a little off but only on the giant 32 inch heavy monitor. For normal use this thing was perfect. Not a complaint of the product as it can barely be expected to hold that massive screen but just for knowledge for those that might use it on a 32 inch. It IS functional but not everly stable
5,This monitor stand works exactly as advertised with my 24" monitor. Assembly was fairly easy with no major issues. I'd recommend this to anyone who needs one.
5,I used this a year and a half on a 34-inch ultra-wide monitor the Acer X34p. At that point I bumped a desk while underneath it and the monitor toppled forward and irreparably broke its screen.I'll give it a 5 stars since 34-inch is out of spec and the stand seems well made in general. It's more than sturdy enough and you can adjust in any direction including vertical tilt and side-to-side rotation. As well I like that it has a flat base. If you're using it on a desk the base won't prevent you from stacking more things on top of it.My poor fancy monitor! Learn from my fail and stick to flat screens with this monitor stand.
5,Bought this stand to be used as a pc all-in-one desk stand as the original stand got thrown away.The stand arrived in good shape packing was good with everything wrapped in foam. I took off a material star because the glass base didn't have any protective film on it. But its fine and no real concerns with it other than a scuff mark or two.The pc it is holding up is a little over 30 lbs so and its holding it up like a champ. The glass base has a nice heft to it and so far has been very sturdy. Its super easy to put together and once done its easy to hook the monitor where you want on the little guide thing. The swivel feels smooth so far.  No issues mounting seems to be compliant with the VESA standards. It comes with like 6 or 7 little sets of screws and washers to fit different tv mounting holes so that was a nice bonus.All in all pretty happy with the purchase and would buy again if needed.
5,I wasn't expecting much for under $30.  I was just hoping it would hold my monitor up and in vertical.  But this is actually really really  nice.  Heavy tinted glass base with surprising stability despite it's relatively small footprint.  The arm and swivel unit are of an all metal construction (some thumb screws and trim are plastic).  Hardware is included for multiple VESA mount types.  Very well packed.  The instructions were adequate.  An overall sturdy and heavy unit that does everything it's supposed to do and seems to do it well.  I will definitely buy another for my second larger and heavier monitor.  There's no doubt this will hold it.  Bravo!  Gimmie another!  If you are on the fence about this unit don't be.
5,It’s awesome having a vertical monitor now I can use for viewing documents. The stand is very sturdy and the base is quite elegant and smooth!
5,I was given this old Dell monitor without the stand so I looked around for a general VSRA stand and came across this one which is absolutely perfect for my needs. Easy assembly super sturdy tilts and rotates perfectly. Exactly what I was looking for!What I wanted to mention for others though what I was seeing in the reviews from other people is that this thing can't rotate 90 degrees / fit vertically with a 32" monitor. This is me rotating my 20" monitor and even that's a pretty tight fit. I have the stand as tall as it can go and I have less than 2" of clearance when I rotate. If you're looking to rotate the screen regularly make sure you don't have too big of a monitor. But if you have a larger monitor and plan on always keeping it horizontal I'd say you're in good shape!
5,Quite a good budget option. The mounting bracket uses hooks and a knob to hold it in place which is a little weird and doesn't feel like a good solution but hey it works better than I expected. This stand looks good on my desk and is sturdy on the wide base. Adjustment options are difficult to use but are a good "set it and forget it" solution. Velcro cable management is a nice touch. Takes some assembly and is clearly manufactured at a very low cost but the result serves all my purposes for a secondary monitor stand. I might go for a much more expensive option for a primary monitor for graphic designers and others who spend $500+ on their monitor but for a basic office option or for a secondary monitor this is a highly functional option at a great price.
5,I have a 32in Vizio TV that I was using as a second monitor with my computer. But the legs on the TV were really low and it would get blocked by my laptop screen and would take up a lot of space on the desk. This completely solved this issue. It was super easy to assemble and it immediately turned my TV into a functioning computer monitor! It saves so much space on the desk and it is raised to make it easier to see. The Base has a glass-like finish and it looks really nice overall. The back of the stand has velcro to keep all of your cords in place and hidden which is a great touch! A great item that I highly recommend if you are trying to convert your TV into a dual monitor.
5,I bought 2 of these stands for my workstation and they are really nice!  They arrived on time were easy to put together- (the seller even included the hardware needed for assembling the item) and they look sleek on my adjustable desktop.  Since my desktop lowers and raises I needed to make sure that the monitor stands would be sturdy and not be prone to tipping over but these are very sturdy and I like the fact that I can adjust the height of the monitors with these stands too.If I had a need to buy stands in the future I would purchase these again
5,I was initially concerned that this would not be very strong primarily was worried about the base being made of glass. Turns out the glass is thick and strong so it was able to support a 25 pound all-in-one computer just fine. It assembles easily and comes with the screws needed for a few sizes of VESA mounts. There are some bolt heads that protrude a little from the bottom where the pillar gets attached to the glass base but they include rubber feet that you stick to the underside of the base to lift it up a bit and gives clearance for the bolt heads.
5,This is a solid and well built monitor stand. The materials are good and the build quality is decent to high. Upon unboxing I wasn't happy to see what seemed like a complicated assembly instruction sheet but it only took 3-5 minutes to assemble and get my 27" monitor attached and all set up. The only tool you need is a phillips screwdriver (there is one included). It also features side to side swivel as well as rotation from portrait to landscape. It comes with a large package of bolts for various TV/monitors but this was unnecessary for my use as the bolts in my monitor were sufficient. I already messaged the company inquiring about some other bases and the owner responded immediately.  The same guy who has a personal note in the instructions with his direct email address. The base appears to be glass is solid and i expect it to last for many years.  Clean minimalist lines on the overall design as well.  I'll try and add some photos soon.
5,I have an LG 34" monitor which came with a nice stand that took up too much room behind the monitor so I couldn't push it far enough away on the desk.  I needed a smaller footprint for the stand behind the monitor.  This stand works great and allows me to push the montior much further back closer to the wall.  It was packaged well very easy to assemble and seems sturdy enough.  The base is tempered glass and just sits under the monitor out of sight for the most part.  Like others have said the height is not infinitely adjustable there are (IIRC) 4 different heights to choose from.  You can also tilt the monitor.  This stand works perfectly for me and I can recommend it.
5,Work great for me
5,Great quality and easy to assemble!
5,Recently redid my PC setup and got a smaller Ikea desk to fit my space. This stand fit perfect and is STURDY. One big plus is that the rubber feeties that go on the base lift it enough that you can run cables under it (even my thick Corsair keyboard cable)... but the one thing I wasn't big on is the velcro cable management straps on the back. They do the job fine but feel very cheeeeaaap. I don't have a lot going on back there so they're holding.Overall very good. Really easy too assemble and comes with everything you need.
4,My only gripe with it is that it does not go up and down on the fly. You have to unscrew and remount to the next desired height. If it had that this would be 5 out of 5 easily. Everythign else is wonderful about it.
3,I have a 31 inch screen and got these because the stock stand it came with was quite bad and bulky. It is fairly easy to install and everything but you should know that there is barely any clearance between the bottom of the monitor and the stand. If you have a 32 inch screen it would be even worse. I would suggest going with a different stand in that case taller by at least a few inches.
5,Really nice product for the value. Holds my 32” screen with more stability than I thought it would. Only complaint would be that the screws that fit my tv were a bit too long but that’s an easy fix so it’s no issue at all.
5,Exactly what I was looking for to get my monitor lower since it was hitting my desk because of the original stand was to high for my setup
5,See title. I would buy again for a normal 27-28" rotatable.
5,I have a Dell S2740L which is a 27" monitor that I wanted to use in portrait mode. I wasn't sure if it the monitor was too tall for the back stand part but after reading a post by D.R Crawford in the Customers Questions and Answers section where he stated that you need to measure your monitor from the center of the VESA plate on the back of the monitor to the bottom edge of the monitor. If that distance is less than 13 inches it should fit in portrait mode. Sure enough the monitor fit perfectly in portrait mode. I even have an inch from the bottom of the monitor to the stand. Assembly was a little clunky but the stand is rock solid after getting setup. Good buy.
5,I bought this for my All-In-One computer which can be sort of hefty. The item said it could handle screens much bigger than what I have but I was still wary. My worries were unfounded as this smallish looking stand is a beast! Easily holds my 30+lb computer and even the cats can't figure out a way to knock it over. The design is reflective and fancy and takes up little space and as described you can turn it tilt it adjust it. I kind of wish there was a way to lock it so it couldn't tilt but I don't even care. The manufacturer website to replace the original stand cost more than twice as much as this and felt cheap (maybe that's why it broke in the first place?) so I'm very very happy with this purchase! Highly recommended!
5,Hooked it up to a new 27" curved monitor using the 100mm VESA attachment no problem. The monitor had a V-shaped base which took away all my remaining desk space. This stand gave much of it back to me. I also wanted to lower the screen since the monitor sits on a riser and I was able to lower it just enough to fall below a shelf. I will say that I would have liked to be able to take advantage of one further lower setting. Raising and/or lowering the screen is a bit of a process but I think most people set it and forget it. Minus 1/2 star for that.
5,Overall this is a decent monitor stand for the price. There is limited flexibility in height based on how it locks in. I would have liked for it to have been about 3/4" taller at the top level. Overall it is sturdy and easy to assemble and use. I was pleasantly surprised by how heavy the base was since I have two cats who can knock things over.It comes with enough different varieties of screws to work with just about everything. The English instructions appear to be machine translated so they are understandable but also quite comical in places. That said the screws provided are just that screws. I used some easier to use screws to attach it.Bottom line: It is a monitor stand. I don't see how this could handle a 32" TV but it handles monitors just fine and doesn't get easily knocked over by precocious cats.
5,ITS A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A CERTAIN AESTHETIC AND IT FUNCTIONA REALLY WELL NO HICCUPS THE ONLY THING GHAT I WOULD CHANGE IS INSTEAD OF BEING IN HOOKS IT SHOULD HAVE A HYDRAULIC STAND
5,Excellent has easy rotation quick assembly and looks expensive. The bottom is actually black glass.
5,I love that its base is flat...I slide my keyboard onto it when I need the foreground for my joystick for games yet still need access to the keyboard.  Also it's the most handsome monitor stand I've ever seen--classy and beautiful flat tinted glass with rounded corners.  My monitor once mounted swivels effortlessly with one finger yet stays firmly in place.  The whole setup seems sturdy and high-quality.  The only drawback is that to change vertical positioning one has to unscrew a knob and move the monitor up or down to the next hole but once I have my monitor in position I never need to move it anyway so that's no problem with me.
4,This is a good monitor stand.  I stink at assembling things (really horrible) and I was able to follow these well written and thoughtful instructions.  The stand is sturdy and it allowed me to raise my monitor height to reduce eye and neck strain.  The stand part which sits on the desk was the smallest profile I could find and it is still very sturdy.  The swivel is very smooth as well and it doesn't feel like anything will fall off/over.  My only complaint is that I wish I could  more quickly and easily change height - it locks in at set height positions only.  If you want to change it you have to detach the monitor from the stand and reinsert.  Still the stand is well made and sturdy and the height position works for me so I'm not sure how much I would ever need to change it anyway.
3,The item is mentioned as height adjustable but for height regulation you should take of your monitor and unscrew itand then screw it again with other height position. IT IS NOT USABLE and it is uncomfortable.Even more the position of the most bottom level is quiet high and it becomes unusable.
5,Sleek look and sturdy design and also was easy to assemble. I’ll be ordering another for my home office since I know it works great with holding up my Dell screen.
5,For the money this is a good stand.  But careful of sharp edges when assembling.
5,Excellent replacement stand.  It comes with many different screws to help secure the monitor to the stand (in case you lost the ones that came with yours).
5,No issue
5,I ordered this stand to change out the legs on a 32” tv for my kitchen. Now the tv can fit on my rotating shelf. I had no idea you could do that until a friend of mine told me about these. I was Leary about which one to order but the description on Amazon was so complete I knew it would work! It’s nice and sturdy too! And might I add pretty!
5,I moved and wasn't aloud to wall mount. I looked at a lot of stands discovered this one. It's amazingly flexible an fits computer needs really well. The ability to to turn and rotate while keep the monitor secure is great. Unlike other stands which shake or you have to hold the base. This one you don't even adjusting the amount force you want it to turn is easy. Height is great to. A must buy if you want a simple stand
3,Need to have a 4mm Allen wrench and a 10mm socket to tighten all of the loose screws or it will move at the slightest touch.  Other than that I like how high it will go I'm tall so getting it higher from the table helps.  The glass base is nice but the plastic trim is very ugly.  The trim is unfortunately necessary.
5,Got this to replace the stand on my new LG 27" monitor as LG's stand is huge and on the lowest height still is a bit too high for my taste. This stand lowers the screen by a couple of inches and it is fine now. Stand took all of 3-4 mins to assemble and then screw in the mounting plate and place it on the stand. Lastly screw in the bolt to lock it in place. All of ten minutes start to finish. Nice and smooth mechanism and very sturdy. I'll be ordering another one of these for my ultrawide.
5,I took the gamble buying this vesa mount for my monitor especially for previous voitek models like mine since ive read alot of reviews that vesa mounting for these model are quite tricky but i took the gamble and try it and wow oh wow it works like charm easy to assemble overall just what i needed for monitor height and space for my setup.
5,This thing is built rugged and is quite stable. Some reviewers complain that the height adjustment is cumbersome but I didn't find that to be an issue.
5,I didn't want a monitor stand that you screw through the desk or clamp to the side. This one was very heavy duty included everything with extras and looks sleek. It is very heavy though so check the weight. I believe the base is maybe tempered glass so be careful not to shatter it.
4,I bought this because my acer x34 came with a huge obnoxiousness stand and couldn’t fit on my desk. This stand works fine and it’s able to hold my acer x34. The only thing that I don’t like about it is that you have to manually change the monitor height by detaching the monitor from the stand and reattaching it. It’s not a huge deal for me because monitors can only go to a certain height on my desk anyway.
5,Simple sturdy & easy assembly.  Works great.
4,The only ding I have toward this stand is that it could use one higher notch (I sit very tall apparently but the highest notch *is* sufficient just not *perfect* hence the single withheld star). That said this is solid sturdy easy to assemble and surprisingly visually appealing and the two cable-management Velcro straps were a surprising bonus that worked out well (part of the visual appeal: having two of them made for a very clean look).
5,Very good it is holding my 34 inch monitor
4,Pros:-Easy to assemble-Easy to maneuver-Directions are fairly easy to understand (broken translation)Cons:-Weight capacity could be an issue - (I have a 27" monitor on it but I ALSO have cats that love to fool around and have been known to knock over TVs not mounted to wall.  I put heavy books at base to stabilize it a bit better.-Maximum height of unit isn't that tall I'm 6'2 - and I'd prefer a higher stand.-Wire holders in back are just flimsy velcro-Directions are in broken English but fairly easy to understand.
5,This is a great stand I chose to use single base stands for my 32" monitors most of the multi stands would move to much after positioning them. They look nice on my desk and hardly notice them after I got everything positioned. I would highly recommend especially for larger monitors.
4,I bought this to put on the 24" Vizio my wife got me for Christmas.  It went together easily enough and the mounting bracket was sized and shaped in such a way as to not interfere with any connectors on the TV.  To adjust the tilt you need to loosen a set screw but swivel and rotate functions are a friction fits only.  I suppose it would be nice if there was some sort of detent mechanism to secure the screen in the horizontal or vertical position (something not really needed for a TV set but could be useful for a monitor).  It's a big improvement over the funky little feet the set came with.
5,I ended up putting my 144hz  27 inch acer TN panel on the right side and my 24 inch 4k panel on the left the stand is very sturdy but be aware it can be very tipsy if you dont use the table clamp that comes with the kit... If you dont want to drill holes in Your table you can still use the base but be careful and make sure the stands center of gravity will be okay... I had to push the arms of the stand behind a little further back to keep the stand from tipping towards me...you can definitely get a neutral balance on the stand but it takes some time to get it right... Other than that the stand is great made out of reasonably thick metal...it is very sturdy...
4,Definitely a solid stand. However as mentioned in some of the reviews the stand does not have a rotation lock which makes it easy to bump and the screen turns crooked or diagonal. If you are using this to lock your monitor in the vertical position then it’s solid. But if you use it like probably 95% of the people that use it to mount the screen the traditional horizontal way then it may be problematic if your screen gets bumped by people or walker-by. It does hold the horizontal position very well. It’s just that if your screen gets touched by someone walking by then it will very likely rotate sideways. This is the reason why I gave this 4 stars.  It’s good but not perfect.
5,just love this monitor free-stand riser. wasn't completed to put it together and it works just perfectly.
3,Easy to assemble but the Samsung G7 32 inch is too heavy for this stand. Tilt isn't strong enough - will sag. Base isn't large enough. Will fall over if desk is moved/disturbed. Had a close call when plugging in cables and had to catch it mid fall. Its a good stand but not for my use.
4,Screws did not work for my Sceptre monitor. Too short. Had to go buy some longer ones at the hardware store. Not a big deal but if you have a Sceptre monitor you may run into this issue.Sceptre 20”-22” may sit way to high for your liking. I had to return this because the monitor itself was a lot higher than I expectedUnfortunately there are only three height adjustment options which in my opinion is the downside of this stand.
5,I wanted a monitor stand for my monitor that doesn't have it's own stand anymore.  But I wanted one that looks like a normal stand not like a desk mount.  It on the heavy side but that adds to it's stability.  Glass base and metal stand is easy to assemble.  It is not easy to adjust the height. The mount screws into the stand a certain positions and needs to be unscrewed to move to another height position.  But I don't need to change height so it's not a big deal.  I would recommend.
5,This stand is great feels solid look good. I have a 27 inch curved on it and had no issues at all for the past year still just as sturdy nothing getting loose.
5,Superb. I purchased this hoping it would work well to replace the stand on my 34” widescreen monitor (even though it claims to work only up to 32”) and it’s excellent. Very easy to install sturdy and stable and takes up less real estate on my desk than the original which is why I wanted it. It also happens that the rubber feet allow just enough height under the base to thread my fairly beefy gaming keyboard and mouse cords through the space - super convenient. I’m ordering another one for my other monitor as well.
5,It was easy to put together and looks so good. Not sure why I didn't get one sooner.Very slick the surface although shiny is still slick looking. Very simple minimalist look which I love like how it has the Velcro straps to hold cords and that its adjustable.I may buy another one so All my notes are on the same stand.
5,Great Monitor Stand! I don't think I was reading close enough because I was really surprised when I saw the sturdy glass base. It's simple and easy to assemble.Only cons ( at least I think its a con) is that you cannot lock in the orientation. Regardless it's super sturdy and doesn't move so this sent a major problem..I will note that the packaging was a little shady. It came in a beat up box that wasn't fully closed. Fortunately the item inside was perfectly fine and the stand came fully assembled.
5,I have two of these one with a 55 inch flatscreen TV and the other with a 38 inch widescreen computer monitor.  They are a great improvement over the stands that came with the displays.  And the price is relatively cheap $30 to $40.  I highly recommend this stand.
5,This is a very sturdy stand. I used to had a monitor that would rotate from landscape to portrait and when it started having troubles I didn’t want to buy that same monitor. This is a great alternative.  I really like that I got to choose the monitor and still have the rotation functionality. My only complaint is that while there is height adjustment it is not easy to change it after the install. On the other hand your monitor will not drop down unexpectedly. The height is “hooked” into the stand. The rotation feature works well and I use it often. Portrait mode is wonderful when reading articles or books. Next time I might buy the stand that holds 2 monitors and keep one as landscape and the other portrait.
4,Needed a mount for an LG 29 inch ultrawide the original stand was taking up a lot of room on my desk. It only took about 20 minutes to put the stand together and mount the screen. The stand is sturdy and having built-in cable management is nice and should be standard with every stand. The stand is not tall enough for my ultrawide to be turned to portrait which is ok with me but something you should be aware of. Overall this is exactly what I was looking for to give me more room on the smaller desk I use for my non gaming PC.
4,Es buen producto se lo monte a un televisor de 32" y quedó sólido
5,Great quality and super easy to assemble. Cannot adjust the height on the fly as someone mentioned but for this kind of monitor stand it is a set it once and done for me.
5,I purchased this for my second monitor as it was on a wobbly unsteady base.  Plus I needed to elevate it to the proper eye level and this stand was perfect.  I was able to adjust it perfectly to the same level of my other monitor and the unsteadiness is gone.  The base of the stand is glass and looks very nice and makes it nice and heavy.  Just gotta watch those fingerprints ;)If I didn't love the riser under my main monitor so much (also purchased on Amazon) I would purchase this stand for it.I would definitely repurchase and recommend this monitor stand.
5,I like this product as a way to Mount my Monitor Vertically.
5,The stand that came with my LG 27 inch computer monitor broke after a few years of use.  I thought that I would have to buy a new monitor.  Somehow I came across this universal stand.  It works great.  It is way better than the original shorter stand.  It is far more adjustable in height swivel and face angle.  I chose to set it about 4 inches higher than the original stand.  And it is very sturdy.  I am glad now that my stand broke!  If you want a stand that can be adjusted to sit at your present height or easily raised up another 4 inches or so this stand will do it.
4,I bought this stand to go with my LG UHD monitor (which had a wimpy stand).The plate glass base was a surprise but it's about 8mm thick. A variety of bolts/washers / spacers were included for attaching the VESA mount. The instructions were clear and each item was in its own section of parts bag. The monitor rotates and tilts nicely.My only wish is that it would raise and lower by just grabbing the monitor as my old Samsung Syncmaster did. The height adjust mechanism has fixed slots. However once it's set for use I doubt I will ever need to change it.
5,purchased for a spare monitor. Took about 5-10 min to assemble its a bit daunting at first but this was because there are more than enough screws included for a variety of different assembly requirements.  4 screws for the monitor and about 3 others for the  unit.  Quick and easy very sturdy.  Great price.
5,It turned out much better than I expected. I got it for working from home and ordered a descend stand to raise my 2nd monitor. I was very surprised at how sturdy and high quality the materials are especially the glass base.
4,Seems to be very strong and supportive. Nice finish and a great product.
4,I tried monitor stands that were like narrow trays with stubby legs and another that attached to the desk like a robotic arm. I just wanted something simple and would not cause extra clutter or obstruction. This bad boy is it. One of the happier purchases I made in 2021 thus far.
5,it work geat just what i needed
4,I got what I expected. I'm not disappointed.
5,The assembly directions got you about 3/4 of the way and then kind of leave you hanging. I get that there are many types of displays but a little guidance would’ve been nice. I did figure it out. Other thing I would against it note the location of your HDMI port. Mine was on the back right in front of the support which creates so access issues. I just bought a right angle adapter which helped.
5,While this stand may not be as adjustable ir easily adjustable it's like the Rock of Gibraltar compared with the flimsy LG horseshoe shaped one. My monitor no longer dances while I'm typing. Plus the high gloss black glass base is much better looking! If you want a solid and great looking monitor stand and can live with it being less easy to adjust...this is the ticket!
5,The product is super high quality and easy to assemble. It is heavy and the monitor doesn't move from the desk. Definitely recommend this product if you want to raise it or turn it vertical.
5,I saved about $79 US by buying a new monitor that has all the specs I wanted but a stand that could only tilt a few degrees.  This VESA stand gave me the functionality that I needed at a fraction of the cost that the same monitor would have been with a flexible stand in the box.  Setup was dead simple thanks to the very complete hardware assortment that seems to cover most monitors. The item arrived in perfect condition. The 27" monitor that is sitting on this stand is absolutely stable. You can spend more but I don't think you can get a better stand.
5,Easy assembly. Took about 10 minutes to put together very sturdy. I would recommend this product.
5,Computer Monitor
4,This is a very very sturdy and well-constructed VESA-compliant stand.  If you don't need to adjust monitor height on a regular basis I highly recommend this product.On the other hand be aware that changing monitor height with this stand is a pain and if you have a 32" monitor this chore may well be a 2-person job.YMMV
5,When I 1st looked for a stand for my 32in monitor I found one that would have costed me around $100. Thankfully I saw this stand and it fits the hole pattern perfectly on the monitor. Very happy with the purchase!
4,I wanted a stand that did not take up as much space as the original stand included with my 27" monitor the LG 27GK750F-B. This stand takes up a minimal amount of space near my keyboard and allows a bigger mouse pad to be used. I did run into one issue; one of the threads on the metal bar was not drilled properly so it took a lot of force to get the screw in. Also since my monitor is 27 inches it needs to be placed on the highest slot to be able to rotate vertically.I've also included an image comparing the original monitor stand in the front and this stand in the back.
5,I love it it's a perfect fit for my monitor screen and it fits well on my desk. Best one to get in my opinion.
5,I got a 31.5" monitor recently and it was so huge it barely fit on my desk. The stand worked okay but it also held the screen very far forward. I measured the distance from the back of the stand to the back of the monitor at about 7.5 inches.My options were to replace my new monitor get a bigger desk or get a new stand. The stand was by far the cheapest option and reduced that 7.5 inch gap to only about 3 inches. My monitor is now in the perfect location not too close and the stand is a lot less intrusive on my desk.
5,Easy to assemble seems pretty sturdy.  Works perfectly for my Dell Inspiron all-in-one model 23 (5348).  Weighing 32 lbs I was a little worried it would be too top heavy and also was worried about cable clearance in the back ports.  Happy to find that it seems stable and there is plenty of clearance to plug stuff in.  Definitely recommend if you've lost your stand for your all-in-one!
5,Excelente soporte elegante y muy robusto con una base muy bonita y fina que la hace ver elegante en cualquier escritorio. su diseño versatil permite girarlo como lo quieras sin ningun problema y la altura ajustable en 4 puntos diferentes. recomendable totalmente y quede muy feliz con esta compra mil gracias!!!!!
4,I bought this for my mid 2010 27" iMac. The description said it would work...and it does...sort of. I bought the kit to convert my iMac and mounted the iMac to the stand. That was all very straight forward and easy and gave me the height I needed for my iMac but the base causes the iMac to be a little top heavy. I think it won't a problem for me based on where I put the iMac but another person might be hesitant.
5,much more stable than before
5,My daughter is in college and kept her roommates TV over the summer because she lived in the same town.  While cleaning the plastic feet on the television snapped.  I ordered this stand to mount - it ended up being so much better than the original feet.  The weight is heavy enough to make it sturdy but he footprint is small enough to allow it to fit on a dorm shelf in her room.  It was fairly easy to put together and came with multiple screws for different VESA standards.  He roommate said she was so much happier because it ended up giving her more usable shelf space that she had not had the previous year.
4,Easy to put together.  The base is smaller than other VESA stands I looked at and it is still very sturdy for holding my 24 inch monitor.  The stock stand was flimsy and held the monitor at a slight annoying angle.  Lots of extra screws come with this to match your monitor.  You can't adjust height quickly but not needed in my case.
4,I purchased this for a small 20” Vizio tv and it fits and works perfect. The build and quality is great. I like that it can swivel side to side but unable to height adjust on the fly. You have to unscrew it. My only complaint is that the base of the stand is huge. Still a great stand!
5,Great alternative for a swivel monitor it saved me $265 for a monitor with swivel capability
5,Not good if you want to change height often (get an arm instead) but if you cant clamp an arm on your desk this will get the monitor to a point where you reduce neck strain.  Easy to move monitor to different levels.  Base has high gloss Black finish.  Almost looks like you are looking thru glass to the actual base. Tilt is limited to about +15 degrees -10 degrees.  Allows monitor rotation 90 degrees.Cable management is simplistic - a strip of Velcro attached to the upright but it works.Easily supported 27" LED screen.  Kit included lots of different hardware for different TV/Monitor screw holes.
3,If your going to use with a Samsung Ultrawide monitor make sure you use a TV tiedown to hook it to your desk or wall. Its way too heavy to support it.
5,There's really nothing negative to say here. It's an incredibly solid well built replacement for an undesirable stock monitor stand. It's simple it's clean and has more than enough weight to hold my 27" with no issues.I bought it primarily because the stock stand for my monitor was way too tall. I was looking up just to see the bottom of the display on it's lowest setting. (Multi-tiered desk.) This stand isn't quite as flexible with height requiring you lock it into one of the predefined spots. Fortunately the lowest one works out perfectly for my monitor and looks clean and sharp as hell. Highly recommend.
5,Well made well packed.  Monitor is safe and secure.
5,I love this thing. It created a whole new dynamic to my desk. Firstly it raised my screen so I didn't have to be looking downwards all day. Secondly the turn is easy to use and I can easily change my orientation from horizontal to vertical. The materials used seem rather high quality and I'm probably going to be buying a second one soon.
5,I bought this to mount a Mac mini . Ordered a Mac mini mount and screwed it to the mounting plate on the stand . Works great because it holds the mini upside down and keeps the only opening to the computer down to keep dust out . Very stable stand will not just slide off the desk .
5,This was easy to install sturdy and easily adjustable.
5,Purchased this stand to accommodate a 21.5" screen and it works perfectly! Once assembled the monitor can be twisted laterally (to the left and right) and vertically (turned from portrait to landscape) without having to fiddle with any pins but at the same time slight bumps will not shift it from position. Adjusting height and the view angle does require moving pins to hold it in place but it's easy to do as well. Good resolution feels great on the eyes.
5,I bought this to use with my old 30" CCFL monitor in portrait mode. So I needed a heavy-duty monitor stand. This was perfect. I was pleasantly surprised by the base. It has a glossy black finish. I expected just a matte metal. So in addition to being very functional it looks good. Great selection of screws and adapters. Worked well with the VESA back of the monitor. Note: the 30" barely fit for portrait mode on the highest rung so a 32" monitor *would not* work in portrait mode with this stand (but would certainly work in landscape mode).
4,more stable than original and adjustment better than original Lenovo all in one stand.
2,Box was partially opened when arrived. When opened I found that it had been assembled previously. The bags that held the screws washers and what not had been retapped. Looking at the product you can tell where there had been screws fastened. When assembled it was hard to turn the screen even with the screws loosened. Just a bad experience and a not so good product.
3,The product didn't allow for full rotation of 32inch monitor other wise it was ok . I was hoping to have the monitor stand higher off the desk than it was but in the end it was ok . This is why 3 stars
5,I have a 32inch monitor  and it held it very well.  My monitor is a Samsung  and said it was not versa mountable but fit perfect.  Great stand
5,Looks great. Easy to set up. Great stability even at Max screen size.Can't think of any cons for the price.
4,Needs better cable managment.
5,I'm using this for my Viotek GFT27DB and it works well.  The whole assembly hardly moves around.  Tilt and swivel are nice.  Height works for me but I can see the lack of flexibility being a problem for someone else.  Did not realize how useful the velcro ties on the back would be for routing all of my cables.  And there's even a bit of space under the bottom to route things as well.  Great product!
4,This is a very elegant monitor base. I'm only removing one star since the tilt is not very pronounced. The monitor can go low or high but I would to use the lowest possible profile and a tilt the monitor back. Not a deal breaker. It is heavy sturdy and has a great build quality.
5,I normally don't write reviews but this warrants an exception.  I was worried when I bought this stand that it wouldn't be able to handle the weight of my Acer gaming monitor (it's a 32'' curved behemoth) but it is not even close to tipping while taking up half the desk space of the stand that came with my monitor.  Also the tempered glass base is a wonderful touch normally at this price you'll get stuck with a glossy plastic piece of junk but this actually looks NICE?!  Great value great product no complaints.
5,This is a great solid stable stand and looks good too. Highly recommend it.The instructions to set it up are adequate enough.  Just do it slowly.The screws provided included M4 X 12mm and are the ones i used on this monitoreven though when I looked at the LG manual it said to use M4 X 10mm.The thickness of the mount and the washer appear to take the extra 2 mm.Just  don't over tighten them.
4,The stand is excellent .... Samsung 32-inch monitor engineering I got for BF is just flat out dumb because mounting is not in the middle like most monitors/TVs and can’t really tilt my screen too much
4,This monitor stand is a little difficult to assemble but works overall keep in mind that its a little bigger than i thought
5,This monitor desk stand was the perfect solution for putting my 32" smart TV on a smaller table than the wide-spread and weak legs that came with the TV. The stand base is made of black glass and attractive enough to look good on a designer table. The stand itself will hold up to a 75 lb. unit.  It will be reused for the next TV and I'll get another to use for the next TV or computer monitor I get - the swivel mount gives a lot of options for angles of view.
5,Very happy with this stand I needed a tabletop stand to use a small wall mounted tv as another monitor. This stand is very easy to assemble to adjust and the build quality seems very sturdy. I currently have a small 22 inch tv on it but I plan to buy a 32 inch tv for a bedroom and I don't want to wall mount it so I can move it around with the furniture. This stand will likely be great for that purpose as well.
5,Nice desktop monitor TV stand. Well balanced and sturdy metal. Wish were telescopic for a little more height but OK for small monitor or TV. Thanks.
4,Es un producto muy bueno pero no lo recomiendo para un monitor más grande de 27 pulgadas
5,Solid stand. The long screw to put in after the monitor is hooked in didn’t have a hole to thread into. Before I knew it my monitor popped off the stand and fell on a can and is slightly damage but still usable.
5,I purchased a 43" TV to work as a monitor for my PC and did not have a large enough desk space to use the TV stand.  This is a 200mmx200mm VESA mount which matched my TV's mounting pattern.  It's sturdy easily adjustable and works well as a monitor stand.  Included all screws necessary for proper mounting.
5,The product is good but beware the largest size of widescreen monitor you can mount vertically (portrait mode) is 27" . I've put up a 27" and there's just about 1 inch between the lower edge and the base of the stand. A 32" widescreen is about 2 inches wider than a 27" on each side so it wouldn't fit.
5,This product was great for me because I had a monitor that was given to me and the previous owner had broken the stand that usually mounts to the bottom of it. So I opted to use this instead as the monitor still has versa mounts in the back. For the price I was very sported to find the base mad of a very sturdy glass material (the same as what you would find in the top piece of a heavy duty coffee table) and it is very maneuverable as well! Highly recommend!!
5,This is a quality made metal and glass monitor stand.  It will hold a heavy monitor.  It has 4 pre-designed slots to adjust the height for best viewing.  It's glassy looking and simply does what it's suppose to.  Hold your monitor sturdy and solid.  Great value for the money.
5,This is sturdy its easy to assemble (took me less than five minutes) and it holds up my computer monitor just fine.  I have a 25" ultra wide.  It works in both Portrait and Landscape mode.  Computer will be mounted in Portrait mode once my other monitors arrive but have been rocking it all day with the Landscape and have absolutely no complaints.  It moves left or right.  It tilts up and down (with some slight finagling with the screw). It can even cant to one side or the other.
5,We had a monitor mount just like this and we were thrilled that this new one holds another monitor just as well as the other one we own.  We would recommend this mount!  We needed this new mount to make another monitor be able to stand in a portrait position.  It does just that.
5,The old flimsy OEM stand from Samsung was noted by many as a piece of junk and yet I was inclined to buy a replacement of the same.  So glad that it was nearly impossible to find from the manufacturer or any of their supply houses so it made me get creative and research alternatives which this is so much better than the original in every regard...
5,We used this on a small led tv and works great.  Well made easy assembly and heavy duty construction and it also looks good.  Would recommend and buy again.
5,Stable and strong with many height adjustments and swivel.  Helps save my back and neck from looking down.
5,Using this with my MSI MAG341cq 34'' ultra-wide monitor. The monitor weighs about 20lbs and this stand holds it perfectly zero wobble. It's easy to assemble and very sturdy. Good height adjustment. Easy to rotate and swivel. The tempered glass base is a nice touch and the column has cable routing ties. My monitor should have come with a stand this nice shame on MSI!!Only complaint is that you have to screw in the height adjustment and can't change height during use. I won't remove a start since this thing is so cheap and I don't ever change my monitor's height.
5,Product was easy to setp came with extra mounting fasteners to ensure fit for different sized PCs and had good instructions. I'm not sure about any of the experiences from people who gave a negative review however I am very particular and I give this item a 5 stars.
4,I have an iMac that came from the factory with the VESA mount equipment so it didn't have its original stand so I grabbed this.This isn't exactly the easiest on the eyes but it was relatively painless to set up and it is sturdy and holds the iMac up without a fuss.
5,Works great! We used it for the PC (24” monitor) and then now it’s in the kitchen for when Im cleaning or cooking! Very sturdy and seems to be good quality. I like that it has a large base because the weight in the bottom really holds the monitor well. I don’t feel like it’ll tip over or break easily.  The adjustable height was great since my husband is tall but when I used it i could bring it down for my eye-level.
5,I purchased this monitor stand for $25.95 and it totally blew my expectations. The glass base is very sturdy and looks amazing. I normally do not like the glossy glass look but this stand looks awesome. It was super easy to assemble and the stand came with like 8 different set of screws for 8 different types of monitors or tv's that can be used. I was very impressed. It's super sturdy and raised my monitor a lot higher than what my old stand could go. My 24 inch monitor looks awesome on it and I am very happy. I definitely recommend this monitor stand.
5,Good Product. Very Fast Delivery (from USA to HK)
4,This is a sturdy stand. I've got an Asus 24" monitor attached to it and it handles it easily. Pretty easy to put together. They give you a collection of different hardware to attach the monitor to the vesa mount.
5,my low sitting monitor hurt my neck and back because of my constant looking down I then put my monitor on box for a while to lift up the screen which kinda helped then bought this and it's a huge improvement! No more pain AT ALL I can easily move my monitor and my desk looks a lot better now that I am not using a box!
5,I was happy with the sturdiness and quality of the stand.  It comes with a variety of screw sets which should fit any TV this stand is designed for.
4,I used this stand for a 27 inch monitor. It is able to support the monitor well is very sturdy and stable and is made of steel and glass. Easy installation process and allows for numerous monitor positions.Update:I recently got another monitor and have purchased another stand and I still love it
5,Works as displayed.
5,Fairly simple to assemble with the only hard part is finding the right sized screws for the monitor. Nice and simple looking very unobtrusive. I reccomend attaching the base while the monitor is front-down on a soft surface as it tends to tilt backwards while fitting all four hooks into their respective holes.
5,I have a very wide monitor and it fit no problem.
4,Bought this for a portrait monitor. It is a better quality stand than expected. Just be careful the base of the stand is larger than you think and made of glass. But a good stand none the less
4,I guess I have a particularly long torso or have a higher preferred viewing angle but I ended up putting this stand on top of another to reach that height.  Other than that it's great though.
5,Great quality for the price.Does the job and can swivel the monitor
5,It is a very sturdy product and easy to assemble. I have a 100x100mm VESA 27-inch monitor and it holds it firm and well. Swivel mechanism is smooth and easy to adjust the up/down angle as well as the height placement of the monitor. Love the looks of the glass base! I believe it is worth its price.
5,You’ll find this very helpful depends on your setup but these are what I’ve been looking for. I’ve got 2 and set them opposite side of my table. Work perfectly and their not loose.
5,Very easy to assemble!  I mean....very easy.  And it’s nice to have at eye level without a stand taking up space on your desk.  They provide an assortment of screws and washers so it will fit with any monitor!
5,
5,This is exactly what I needed to support a small monitor for my new Raspberry Pi 4 ... it was very well packed the pieces went together without much effort it's very strong and sturdy there were way more screws than I ended up needing the small parts were very well packaged and clearly labeled the assembly instructions were really good it uses a nice heavy tempered glass base that looks classy it tilts swivels rotates nicely it's really a great product I recommend it to anyone needing a stand for a small to medium sized monitor.
5,I needed a sturdy pedestal stand for my kitchen TV which we place on a turntable so we can rotate it between the kitchen and breakfast area.  This stand fit my TV mounting holes perfectly and is rock stable on top of the turntable.  I highly recommend it.
5,Love my new stand!!! Got it today easy to assemble very sturdy for the price too! My screen is about 27” and it doesn’t quite turn vertically like others have mentioned but I don’t need that so overall amazing stand! Very happy!
3,Based is used and has black sharpie marks what looks like an attempt to cover scratches.
5,Very easy to assemble looks nice and seems pretty sturdy. I was able to bring a monitor home from my office but my work wouldn’t allow me to take the monitor stand. This is a great price ans came quickly so that I could work from home easily.
5,I love the stand it came very fast and looks amazing with monitor. Easy to put together. 5 stars
3,Not enough height adjustment to align multiple (3 in my case) monitors. The slots cutouts in the stand arms are inconsistent between each stand that you simply can't get multiple monitors aligned to the same height. You're dependent on having enough play in the mounting plate to get it somewhat close but even then it's still off by about half an inch. Probably not a big problem for the average person but if you're stretching code diffs between screens with size 9 - 11 font that will easily offset a line of code by at least full line.If you're not particular about that type of thing these are good for the price easy to assemble and seem reasonably sturdy.
5,I really like the base.  It is a heavy piece of dark glass.  Very modern look.  Easy to change height.
5,Very nice tired of having to use text books to bring to height level. This stand solves all that
5,I needed a solution to get my monitor up higher than the OEM stand and this did the trick. The stand is solid and the material quality is excellent.
5,I bought this to raise my Dell S2240M monitor above the laptop screen. The assembly was straightforward. I combined this with the WALI VDE001-2 VESA mount adapter bracket because the monitor did not have a VESA mount. The two worked together perfectly.
5,Supports my 32 inch Samsung monitor with no issues. Sturdy and the base part has a glass surface which I wasn't expecting. Very nice looking. Glad I chose this one.
5,We have this standing on a glass top and have NO concerns whatsoever.  The stand is sturdy built well and easily adjusts to correct height.
5,This stand is great it turns an old monitor that does not tilt or pivot to profile view into basically a new functional monitor.  During lockdown and working from home monitors that pivot to profile are hard to find or too expensive.  So this was a real lifesaver.  It's also sturdy and looks nice.
5,I misplaced the original stand for an older Dell Inspiron AIO computer which is heavier than most monitors.  Worked great looks good and has plenty hardware to work with most any mounting need.  Quick arrival in a sturdy box and packed well.  Didn’t realize it has a heavy glass base but it looks classy.  Went together easily and has lots of positional adjustments for your monitor or computer.
5,I bought this for a 34 inch widescreen monitor. It is far better than I expected.  The stand was easy to assemble and is sturdy. The swivel and tilt capabilities work well with just the right amount of resistance when changing positions.
5,This stand raised my monitor enough that the sun no longer shines in my eyes through my office window. If the sun shines in your eyes through your office window this monitor stand just may be the solution.
5,I bought this about two weeks ago and it has held up well! It is a very sturdy stand that can tilt and swivel and has four height adjustment settings. It does take a little bit of work to change the height or tilt (you have to go behind the stand loosen a screw then re-tighten it) but the upshot is that your monitor will stay in place. I am using it for a 24 inch monitor and it holds it way better than the stand it came with. Definitely recommend!
4,I bought this so I could mount my 27" Apple LED Cinema Display in the portrait orientation. It works for that but the fit is so tight you won't be able to easily rotate it back to landscape. This isn't a problem for me but FYI.
4,4 starts ONLY because the base is glass. Yeah it's pretty but also shows finger prints and can break.Otherwise easy to assemble. works as expected. no complaints so far.
5,Stand is great nice sleek and very sturdy. I definitely recommend using this for any Monitor.
5,This stand is just awesome.  It looks fancy and clean and is very sturdy.  Assembly was a breeze and took minutes.  I got it to replace the LG 32GK850G-B's AWFUL "V" shape stand because that stand wouldn't leave enough room for my mouse pad while this stand works wonders.  It's very space efficient.  The only thing I would add is just 1 extra notch for height.  I didn't mark down a star because it was sold as advertised.
4,It’s sturdy easy to put together would give it a higher rating but because of the design there is some screen wobble not a lot but I can see it being annoying to some people. Otherwise I really like this product
5,Used this to turn a monitor that was being replaced into a second screen in portrait layout.  It went together nicely and fairly intuitively which was rather important because the English translation in the instructions was a dumpster fire.  But like I stated it went together and is holding a 19" monitor quite well - I bought a second one after this one.  Thumbs up.
5,I was a bit hesitant to purchase this monitor stand. It seemed a bit too good to be true. However when it arrived in the mail I knew I had made the right choice.The materials are top-notch. The base is a very heavy ceramic of sorts with a glass top. Looks very high end! Even the metal "pole" and VESA bracket are very solid heavy durable pieces. I've had it for over a month and I love it!
5,I was looking for a rotatable monitor for coding in the beginning. Then I found this stand which turns my old 1080p monior into a portrait one. Exactly what I need! Very satisfied.
5,This is a super high quality stand!Much better than I expected. Assembled in mere moments and sturdy as a tree.I almost feel bad putting such a mediocre monitor on it.
5,This was extremely easy to install and it is very sturdy. I can tilt the monitor up or down or rotate it.
5,Easy to assemble very stable and even fit my 34” Ultrawide perfectly. Only con is that there are ore determined holes for the hight so you can’t adjust it to the exact position you want. Great stand overall!
5,This monitor stand is very sturdy easy to assemble and comes with the necessary hardware for your monitor/TV. I am currently using it for my TCL 32” TV  and it works perfectly fine. I like how I am able to swivel the TV left or right and adjust the height of the TV as well. I am a very happy customer and will definitely recommend this product.
4,El artículo vino con un pequeño golpe pero después todo está bien.
1,I cannot understand why the base was made of glass.  It broke into 1000 pieces and is now a completely useless.  I would not waste my money on it.  I'm not sure what to do with it now.
4,I use 30" monitors in portrait orientation. The diagrams suggest there is a 13.7" maximum clearance from the center of the monitor to the stand. However it's only 13.0" which is barely not tall enough for my 30" in portrait orientation.
5,I have a 23 inch Acer T230H touch screen. It's big it's heavy and no free standing monitor stands I've found have been able to stand up to the size and weight of the monitor without it wobbling all over the place. This one is great quality and very sturdy. My only complaint is with the screw on the back that holds the monitor to the mount. It's small sticks out and is hard to get tight enough.Overall great buy!
5,I like the product. Fast assembly moves left and right and tilt up or down. HOWEVER i bought this to use in portrait mode. The swivel cant be tightened and mine is loose as a goose.However customer support is good. They are sending me a replacement bracket so i have changed the review to 5 stars. The engineering design to this product was very sturdy and easy to use.
5,Super easy to assemble. I think the base is glass seems durable and is SUPER heavy!
5,Easy to assemble and tempered glass base looks good
5,Overall absolutely love the stand only thing not a huge fan of is the system used to raise and lower the height it's locked in and if you want to raise or lower you have to losen a thumb screw and move it to another preset notch other then that it's great for a monitor that has a missing or damaged stand
4,not perfect but definitely does its job well without any worries. The only concern is the bolt specs seem to be just a tad to small I added an extra washer. 4/5 great value and does the job
5,Used it for a 32" flat screen TV. Legs on TV were too far apart to fit on TV stand. This solved the problem
5,I have an LG 34UC88 and it has always been wobbly. This stand is much better than the original and can put up with my intense typing. I do wish that it had a way to tighten the 360 adjustment and the side to side adjustment as it only has tilt locking.
5,Easy to install. Stable. No issues after 1 month of use. It has velcro in the back for wire management which is cool. It's pretty easy to mess with the monitor angle once the monitors are mounted.
5,Loved this stand sturdy heavy and fits like a glove wish I would have bought earlier! Well built and will last a long time
5,I have a 29" ultrawide monitor for my computer and had trouble finding a stand that was tall enough without wobbling around on my desk. This stand solved the problem. It's extremely stable and well built and I'd definitely recommend it.
5,Excellent produet!  I would highly recommend this easy to follow directions.  Took 15 minutes to put together and monitor mounted!
5,Absolutely love this stand.  I was simply looking for something that I could attach a separate VESA mount to for my work SurfaceBook and keep at eye level.
5,This stand works perfectly with my 22” monitor. It is sturdy functional and with the black glass base it is stylish as well. I love the ability to use my monitor in portrait mode as well as the traditional landscape.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have a 27inch LG Ultragear 27GN600-B Gaming monitor and it fits perfectly  its worth the price you can't go wrong with this one.
5,Honestly such a fantastic product for the money! Holds the monitor perfectly there's no gobbling at all very smooth movement and simple design would recommend to anyone.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I really wanted a new monitor that could go into portrait mode but since theres nothing wrong with my current monitor it would really be a waste. This stand is really worth the money and I didnt even realize it had a solid glass base which makes it look super sleek. I have an older monitor so I was worried about the screws they provided but they worked just fine.
5,I have a small monitor not requiring a great deal of support but this stand is incredibly sturdy and feels as though it could easily hold a screen twice the size of mine. A great value overall with plenty of screw selections provided (to fit various monitor backs) well labeled parts/instructions and higher-quality aesthetic than expected. The front/back/side tilt control and cord-management back velcro are nice touches too.
5,Excellent product. Assembled it in 15 mins. High quality materials. The height adjustment is staggered - not contiguous as you would find in OEM stands. Nothing to complain about. You need to pull out the monitor hooks to adjust height. Also the tilt and swivel work flawlessly. I am using it with a 24” monitor. Would highly recommend.
5,Overall great for the price. Does what I need it to do which is raise up my monitor so I’m not looking down at it. With a 27” screen I can easily move it but so far (after a couple months) it’s sturdy enough that it doesn’t move on its own or droop down under the weight of the monitor.
5,I was looking for a custom stand thats adjustable in height for my dell optiplex 3030 All in one pc. Turns out this stand not only adjusts in height but also swings. Its well built and seems very sturdy. I'm very pleased and would definitely reccomend this product.
5,I needed a stand for a monitor that had been previously mounted on an arm on a desk. The original stand had long since been lost. This stand is very sturdy and worked great for my needs. As a result one of my colleagues ordered the same monitor stand for his own use.
4,I actually bought this on hopes of customizing it for my 24” HP and totally worth the price
5,This thing is nice and sturdy. Looks nice too. Can't go wrong with this if you just need a stand for a single monitor.
5,Got an old display as a gift without table mount. This one works just fine. The platform is quite wide I put my Chromebook on it.
5,excellent monitor stand easy to setup and fast and also a great product for the price if are not looking to move your screen up and down if not i recommend
5,I have purchased two of these and they make very good replacement stands for monitors.
5,Great stand exactly what I wanted. Very stable sturdy and ez to assemble. Put it on top of my own custom made riser for a 27” monitor. Very happy with this purchase :)
3,Set up was easy but getting rid of the lip on the Samsung curved monitor was another story!  Product-wise it is solid and what I expected.  A bit annoying on the difficulty of adjusting the height other than that I am satisfied enough to keep the product.
5,My son gave me his monitor without a stand.  Bought this.  Easy to put together.
5,I got a monitor for free but it didn't have a stand.  I ordered this after reading the great reviews and am very happy with it.  It is extremely sturdy and is easily adjustable.  The heavy base makes me feel confident that this will not tip over even though my monitor is very heavy.
5,pros: sturdy easy to assembly several height adjustments works will for my computer screencons: non at this time
5,This monitor stand was easy to assemble and works perfectly to hold my 34” ultra wide display vertically. The base feels solid and has a premium look with the black glass and there are even Velcro strips on the back for cable management. For the price I’m very impressed with this stand.
5,When you need to adjust your large monitor this is perfect for various height adjustments.
5,My 4K monitor has a crappy static-stand which is way too low. This stand perfectly fits my needs. It does not support rotating my monitor into portrait mode however it offers the perfect height I need in normal landscape mode.
5,Works well. Stable and easy to assemble. Wish it was a little taller.
5,My friend gave me his old Samsung monitor without a stand. I tried to find the original replacement stand for it to no avail. Finally gave up and bought this one instead. It's easy to assemble and I've been using it for more than a few months. It also has the option for me to rotate the monitor vertically which is extremely useful when I'm coding.
1,Although it's a good quality stand unfortunately  it does NOT work as intended! I purchased this stand based of the description that fits monitors up to 32" which it does only if you setup on the horizontal view! Once you decide to flip the monitor to a vertical stand there isn't enough clearance from the bottom  and the brackets on the back don't hold it in place! Otherwise it's a great stand for vertical monitors smaller than 32"!
1,This product is cheaply made would not recommend.
5,I used this as a replacement stand for my old TV. It a Great replacement and is very sturdy for a 32” TV which I moved into my office as a computer monitor.
5,Used this on a BenQ 27 inch monitor that had a bulky stand with no adjustment abilities. This stand gives me the ability to adjust the monitor how I want and looks a million times better than the original. Easy to put together and install. I would highly recommend.
5,Holds my LG 34UC79G with no problem. Basse isn't too big so doesn't take up all my desk space. No wobble good motion adjustments.
5,I was amazed by the quality of the product I thought this would be a cheap temporary fix to help with my neck pain. Now I can't imagine going back to my old monitor stand. It is sturdy easy to assemble and very adjustable. Worth every dollar.
4,The only problem is that you can't angle the monitor up. In fact the highest I can angle my 27" monitor is a little below the horizontal line.
5,This was my first aftermarket computer stand. I wanted to turn my 23 inch monitor vertically and this thing does it perfectly. It was easy to put together and I'm super pleased. Don't spend a bunch of money on a hydrolic arm. This thing is the real deal.
1,Not stable at all the glass bottom broked.
5,The glass was fine on mine no scratches and I don;t turn the screen and it is straight and does not move. Overall this is built well and working for me. I would think the rivet holding the mounting plate would be a weak point if you flipped the monitor portrait to landscape often.
5,THE BASEPLATE IS NOT THE SAME ON BOTH SIDES. It was really hard to tell and when I finally figured it out I already had the feet adhered to the wrong side. It still works upside down and nobody else will even know but I will. I'll know every time I sit down to the computer. Watch out kids.
4,stand was easy to assemble the only problem it has is the rotation part of it is too loose and the monitor keeps falling down to one side. otherwise the rest works great.
5,Very good quality sturdy easy to assemble and yes it does fit 27” monitors in portrait mode. Very happy 😃
5,What surprised me was the weight. It feels very high quality and allows me to easily rotate my screen. Exactly what I needed.
5,Was concerned about having a glass base but it's heavy and works perfectly.Easy to assemble.Lots of extra bolts included.Very happy with this purchase.
5,I mounted a 24 inch Visio tv as a monitor on this stand and was very happy with the build quality and looks of this stand. I did end up using all 8 washers in the assorted hardware kit. But I would recommend to anyone looking for a stand for their monitor or tv!
5,Best monitor stand I've owned very very very well build.
5,Great product. I'm using it on a 34 inch ultra wide monitor and it works just fine. Very sturdy and well build. This stand can hold up to 70 pounds.The looks is neutral and so I’ll  fit you gaming setup. I liked it so much that I bought another one for my secondary display.
5,Wow. For the price the stand is exceptionally well built. It's better built than some of the high end stands out there. Very sturdy easy to assemble and looks great. I am a little disappointed that my 27' lg monitor can't go into portrait mode but it's no biggie. The swivel is very smooth. Definitely recommend this stand.
5,This stand is high quality for price. Its all metal. I needed a new stand for my new 31 inch monitor. This stand is sturdy adjusting heights can be a pain but I don't plan on doing that. It can tilt and turn with ease also!
5,Used to replace factory mount for 24 in monitor. Works great if you are looking to install in a shallow desk and don't need to constantly adjust. All of the hardware was included to mount in a 100X100 configuration. The price is very reasonable considering what you get.
4,Works well. Nice base A little awkward to assemble but that is to be expected.
5,It works and the stand is actually better than I expected for the price. My monitor on the other hand the VESA screws are towards the top of the monitor so even placing the VESA mount to the top spot my monitor gets a cm clearance on the bottom. So check your monitor first make sure the VESA is low enough.
5,I am using it on a  32 inch tv as a computer monitor. It is great because you can adjust it for good vision sight.
5,What I like about it is it works
5,sturdy   using for 24" tv/monitor ...  liked it so much i ordered two more
2,I chose this "Amazon Choice" product as I have had good results relying on Amazon's opinion in the past but on this one the product does not live up to the description.  I purchased it to provide a portrait view for a 20lb large monitor spent an hour assembling it only to discover the stand is not high enough to rotate the screen.  It's sturdy I like that disappointed otherwise.  My monitor is a hanns-G 27" model hsg1081.  Maybe a 16 or 17 inch monitor can rotate to a portrait view. This size limitation should have been highlighted in the product description.
5,Fantastic monitor stand. It is built extremely well. 4 height adjustments. It comes with extra screws and spacers to help fit your computer monitor. It tilts up and down and swivels. Very sturdy build.
5,Very stable monitor stand easy to swivel the monitor from landscape to portrait. Glass topped base gives it added elegance.
3,One of the holes in the base needed to be retapped as it had some metal in the threads. Needs to be one inch or so deeper in the base to be a bit less likely to tip forward but once all that's taken care of it's a nice match for a PC with tempered glass. Didn't return for the thread issue as I had the tools to fix it but annoying none the less.
5,Does what it needs to and its pretty to boot. I have a hefty monitor and it handles it with class.
5,Really pleased with this excellent monitor stand. I was nervous about getting the right fit and more nervous about assembly but it fits perfectly and was easy peasy to put together. Quality materials great details (cord holder swivel). Exceeded expectations!
4,Easy to assemble and really sturdy. The glass is nice and makes the stand seem more premium.
5,Beautiful. Perfect for my 32" LG 32ML600M monitor.For other monitor just make sure the the VESA plate does not block your cables.
5,Quality there is a glass base a really nice monitor stand I got it to vertical with my monitor. it has cable straps in the back fast shipping USA domestic. I'm really happy with my purchase. and for the price point it's cheaper than amazon basics. it has a FULL range of motion. BUY IT.
5,Bought this stand for my boyfriend Fit perfectly for his monitor very easy to assemble and is super sturdy.
5,This stand was easy to assemble and was very sturdy
5,The tilt sucks for whenever you want to adjust it but it's a good solid stand and I love the thick glass base.
5,Easy to put together. My second time ordering this stand and it was able to hold both my 27" LG and 24" MSI monitor. Very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Got this monitor stand as a replacement for the Acer g246hl 24 inch monitor. Works as intended and was very easy to assemble. Feels sturdy and although I am not a fan of a glossy finish on the top part of the base it does look nice.
5,Only complaint is that when i put my monitor vertical it won't hold no way of tighten it to keep it vertical so i had to drop it down to the lowest slot to where the monitor is touching the bottom so that it won't turn..
5,Best replacement mount well designed and a good weight. Only issue was one screw at the bottom would not twist all the way in thank god for the silicone shoes which lifted the platform up so the screw didn’t interfere with the set up
5,Exactly as discribed.
5,Works as it should.  Delivered on time. Can't ask for more
2,Monitor does not lock in place when turned sideways. Due to the uneven weight of monitors (they tend to be heavier on the bottom) the weight shifts it to an angle and there’s no way to lock it in place once it’s set sideways. I had to prop something underneath my monitor to stop it from rotating past 90 degrees.Also. One of the screws on the bottom to hold the arm bracket in place would not screw in whatsoever; only one of the included screws was able to be screwed in.For $35 you’d expect better quality from something like this.
5,Works great with my monitor.  Glad I purchased this item.
5,The only thing that i didn't like was that you have to take the monitor off the stand to raise and lower it (one thumb screw). Other than that its a great stand.
5,I bolted my monitor to this thing so I could turn it 90 degrees factory stand didn't allow for that.  Fits a 27" screen mounted in Portrait orientation.
5,Does the trick and very easy to use for my 20" computer monitor. The directions are lacking but I'm not going to knock it for that due to the low price and it's still very easy to figure out.
2,I have a 32” Samsung UJ590 on this stand. The description says that 32” monitors are compatible. But fails to mention that monitors that size will not be able to flip into portrait mode (90 degrees). The stand is okay but I bought it for this feature so I’m a little disappointed.The stand itself is easy to assemble and is sturdy. It is a good stand for anything under 32”.Invest a few more bucks and get a taller/better stand if you need to flip the screen with larger monitors.
5,Bought this to replace the flimsy stand that came with my 32 inch curved monitor. Was easy to assemble and fits great for my needs.
5,It was a pleasure to assemble this product every pieces are labeled grear directions  great quality.  I strongly recommend  this product
5,easy to assemble and it is fits to my 27" monitor
5,Holy crap this thing is amazing. It's extremely durable its solid build makes almost any monitor feel secure and stable. That fact that it fits on even my monitor made back in 2008 makes this a perfect stand.
5,Very happy weighted & sturdy enough for my 24" AOI. I can turn the monitor side to side without the base shifting. Looks great and I was able to improve my seated posture/ ergonomics.
5,installation was easy. Just got it for three days so far it is very good.  Definitely love that they provide variety options for the screws.  Allowed me to find the one fits my Monitor.  I like the option that you can tilt your screen as well.
5,Sturdy and doesn't wobble. You have to try hard to wobble it.. I use on a standing desk with glass surface and cheap stands that come with consumer monitors wobble with a slight bump of the desk. Not this one.
3,With in vertical orientation there is no locking feature to prevent rotation so the monitor just rotates back towards horizontal/landscape orientation.
5,Easy to assemble with instructions. Cheap solid build and sturdy. Able to tilt swivel and adjust height. I wish the height adjustment wasn't so manual. But at this price point that shouldn't even matter. Using this vesa mount on a 27 inch monitor (KG271u- Acer).
5,good
5,I love it! I bought it to turn my monitor vertical and it does that perfectly.
5,A little shorter than I needed but made it work.  Very sturdy
3,this is a very sturdy and well made vesa monitor stand mount package my only issue with this is that there is no way to tighten the swivel/rotation of the vesa mount that attachs to the monitor itself. So if you have an off centered monitor with an adapter attached to your monitor it's going to tilt at an angle with no way to tighten it solid.
5,Very nice quality sleek look and functional too.
5,This TV stand is exactly what I was looking for.  We use it for a 26 inch TV in the kitchen on top of the fridge and it is perfect.
5,I had previously tried a different stand but the base was much too big; this one is smaller and provides more than adequate support for my monitor.  It appears well made and was easy to assemble.
5,Material quality is top notch and the adjustments are really easy to use. I used this stand to replace the stock stand that came with my LG 27GL850 monitor since that one sucked and it fit right in and serves much better.
5,Overall the stand seems very sturdy looks great.  There are some plastic pieces which feel low quality and but assembly was easy and it’s far better than the stand that came with the monitor.
5,I've got a 32" Dell that I'm using it with and that would be about the biggest monitor I would recommend but it works great!Looks nice too.
5,Purchased to raise up a 32" monitor. Works great. Good adjustability. Fairly easy to install.
5,Lliked TV stand.
2,On the positive side this stand is very sturdy and easy to assemble with plenty of hardware to attach to any monitor.  It also looks nice with a base that can be either shiny or matte depending how you flip it.  Unfortunately there are just not enough height adjustments.  The adjustment slots are every 1.5" and the height I really wanted was right between 2 of the possible adjustments.  Also the adjustment slots do not go low enough.  If you have a platform that you want to put this stand on the monitor might be too high even on the lowest setting.  I wish I had tried the Vivo stand instead.  It looks like it can adjust to any height.
5,This just works and it works well.
4,It was better than I expected.
5,Love it! Bought 3 total:)
3,The stand is solid. The only thing I don’t like about it is that the stand is not high enough. Not tall enough for my liking.
5,Real value for dollar. Included everything (even tools and alternate bolts) to mount my 22" Asus monitor in a few minutes with no problem. Clever design allows reasonable flexibility with a simple and sturdy design.
5,Great product very sturdy
5,I had been looking for several years for this stand and most were more expensive than the monitor.  I am very happy to get my monitor off my home made wooden stand.
5,Noice
4,Very nice quality does exactly what I needed.
2,Overall the stand was super sturdy and strong but the product I received is missing with few pieces ( screws for monitor back) and so had a trouble in finding the right set of screws to fix it
2,First the good- the materials are impressive and feel sturdy. The instructions were clear and they provided more than enough parts for assembly. Overall the operation of the stand is adequate for the price.Now the bad and it's pretty bad. There are holes on the back of the stand to screw a stabilizing screw through so that the mount that is hooked in does not inadvertently fall. However every single one of the screw holes are completely misaligned so that the screw is so skewed that it cannot go all the way through. What a shame.
4,Fits my needs and desk perfectly
5,This is a sturdy good looking and easy to assemble unit. It provides the functionality it advertises and the price is reasonable. I’m happy with the purchase.
5,I bought a 30 inch monitor with no stand and thought my only option would be OEM. I found one online at $50 plus $30 shipping!Then I found this! What a bargain! Easy to assemble. Great instructions. Outstanding!
5,Works well but for the a very large monitor probably will not allow for complete rotation from landscape to portrait.  Seems strong enough.
5,Works exactly as expected.
5,It’s a very good monitor stand! For the money you cant go wrong. It’s holding my 30 inch Apple Cinema Display which is a heavy sucker. So there you go
5,Nice product. Using it for 32" LG Monitor that had 100×100 Vesa mount capability.Shipped very quick.
5,Sturdy product reasonably priced with prompt delivery... used to mount a monitor portrait v landscape
5,27 inch iMac is what I purchase it for. Easy to setup and I really like how it swivels and stays where I put it. If I need another I'll be buying again.Highly recommended.
5,Great product works like it should and as described.
5,Received and put it together today. Supporting my 23" ASUS monitor with no issues whatsoever. Quality and glad I purchased.
5,This is a good value the only criticism I have is that the plastic cover that goes where the base meets the pole could've been a little nicer looking. Other then that great buy.
5,Works with 34" ultrawide
5,Needed a stand for an older monitor that somehow lost it's original. Does the job.
5,I love the stand. It's sturdy well made adjustable and is just what I needed.
5,Great stand for the price
5,Solid METAL. Good construction. Very sturdy!
5,Needed it to replace broke stand on 23" View sonic monitor this thing will hold up a battleship LOL
2,took me a while till i finally got it out of the box and finally used it wish i had assembled it right when it was delivered.. one of the screws at the base came with a nick in it and the bolt wont screw on so now i am terrified to nudge my monitor without worrying it will fall because it only has one screw in the base... be sure to open and return in a timely manner
4,Sufficient and reasonably priced
5,Me encanto lo recomiendo
5,Purchased this for my LG ultrawide monitor since LG's stand is way too large for my desk. It took about 5 mins to set up and the setup looks really slick.
5,absolutely perfect
5,Went together very easily and works great very sturdy.  Appreciate the adjustability.
5,Installation was easy on my 29" ultrawide monitor. The stand is sturdy and keeps the monitor from bouncing around like the cheap stock stand. The various height adjustments and cable management tools are nice features. Would recommend.
5,Great product looks good easy to assemble. I bought it for a Samsung CHG70 27 inch curved monitor and it works perfectly.
5,Easy to assemble solid build works great one month in.
5,Does exactly as described.
5,awesome!
5,Its easy to assemble and comes with instructions. Gave me some extra room.on my table. Definitely a great buy. Holding up my monitor for sure [23  - 25 inches].
5,Did not expect it to look so good. Very impressed
5,sdfg
5,Perfect hight for my Imac 2017. Sturdy and easy to assemble
5,Excellent rugged stand. I especially appreciated the very thorough hardware kit which had every size bolt plus a driver.
5,The base of the stand is black glass and is really heavy. It actually looks a lot better in person.
5,Works great for Samsung CHG70. If you thinking of buying this monitor this is the stand needed for any normal to slim desk.
5,Seems stable than the Non-VESA Mount version...
5,Super item super fast delivery super service super seller.
5,Is very sturdy no complaints
5,The product worked perfectly for elevating a television set quality was good and heft was enough to maintain balance.
5,Very nice looking stand. Easy to setup. Solid build quality. Buy it!
2,Despite the claims of 13-32 inch screen mounting cannot hold a 32 inch monitor (with a very thin bezel) in a portrait orientation.  Probably stops around 27 inches.  Do not buy to hold a 32 inch monitor in portrait mode.
5,Nice monitor stand easy to install
5,Very good
1,The look is ugly in black
5,Needed a replacement for the orginal stand that we lost. Works perfectly on my Dell computer. Very sturdy.
5,Easy to assemble and adjust.
5,Is exactly as described and supports the monitor I needed it to
5,For our use holding a 24" TV this stand is perfect. Easy to assemble and easy to adjust.
5,Needed a stand for a monitor to give away this is solid for the price
5,This stand is great! Very easy to assemble and looks nice.
5,Bought from Amazon Warehouse. Like new easy to assemble.
2,Hard to picture this holding the claimed 77lbs for long. Get what you pay for.
5,Love it. It worked very well for my monitor. I used it to turn my monitor vertical. I have 27” monitor.
5,Overall a great investment. Works as advertised. Looks very nice. Couldn't be happier. I use it for a 24" monitor in portrait mode
1,The description of this monitor stand is very misleading.  I bought it so I could rotate my 27" monitor to portrait position.  The description says it will fit up to a 32" monitor but what it doesn't tell you is if you want to rotate it that only works with a 25" monitor or smaller.
5,Great product
5,I liked the stand seems well made. Mounted a 26" monitor on it and worked well. Was easy to assemble.
5,A good price for a sturdy and not terrible looking stand.  Very happy with this purchase
2,Can't recommend this monitor stand if you want to frequently and easily adjust the height.  Fine for set it and forget it but if you want to easily raise and lower the monitor you'll want to find a different option.  This one requires that you turn the stand around unscrew the attachment pin juggle the unconnected monitor move the monitor up/down a slot and then re-attach the screw.
5,Easy to install and very sturdy stand for my 24 inch computer monitor.Nothing bad to say about this.
5,This is the nicest monitor stand I've seen. Pull the trigger on this one. You won't regret it.
5,Great for what i needed it for but i wished it was a few bucks cheaper. All in all good if ur in a snap
5,Better quality than i had expected. For the price its a fantastic mount!
5,I purchased this for a 21" monitor.  Works great.  Feels kind of heavy; not cheap and plastic-y.
5,Very well made would have given it more if I could
5,I mounted my Ultrasound monitor to it to conserve space! Wow! It worked and is lightweight!
5,I like very helpful and easy  to assemble.A little heavy.
5,Great item. I have been using it for 2 months. It's great.
5,. .. . .  built strong and easy to assemble. For a 27" monitor.
5,Great quality def would recommend
5,Works great and perfectly fits my 27" monitor to make it into vertical stand.
5,Easy to assemble solid and looks great! Highly recommend
5,Works for what I needed and fairly inexpensive I’d lowkey recommend it.
5,Looks casual yet elegant.  Lovely stand.
3,Cant adjust the firmness on the rotation. Spins kinda loose. Make sure u dont touch the screen or youbwill have to fix the alignment
3,The threads for the screws were not done correctly and i had to brute force it but it was fine after i got past that
3,Overalll good product gave 3 Stars because product  swivels up and down with no way of tightening it.
5,Excellent device stable easy to assemble. Allows for manipulation along multiple axes. Very impressed for the price.
5,Bought this for my son. He absolutely loved it.
5,Best ever love so good would a million of em
5,Other than one base screw being next to impossible to install it is perfect. Sturdy attractive and very adjustable.
3,Great looking and working. The only complaint is the hardware and monitor spacers provided were all wrong length and or thread. Had to get them from hardware store.
5,Very sturdy and heavy stand. Very little moniter wobble occurs with this stand.
5,Wonderful product  Glass Base  sturdy well made easy to assemble great dollar value at $28.
2,Bought this to set up a vertical monitor. It leans down. I had to put a cork at the  bottom to make it hold in place. Wasn't very happy with it.
5,Good stand recommend
5,Sturdy stand material quality is very good for this price. The base is made of glass looks pretty cool
5,Took about 15 minutes to assemble and is pretty sturdy.
5,Just what I needed! It's working as I was hoping it would.
5,Very easy to assemble weighted base is very sturdy and compact on desk. Highly recommend
5,Perfect fit for my monitor. 😎
5,Great small tv stand.  Sturdy and easily adjustable.
1,Says it fits 32" monitor but too small to swivel for portrait.  I guess technically it fits horizontally but I bought it specifically for portrait.Update - tried with a 27" monitor and it STILL doesn't rotate cleanly.  It will rotate but the monitor has to be pivoted forward to clear the base.I feel like the makers of this product either A)  Failed to test standard sized monitors before writing their marketing literature or B) Know it doesn't rotate the sizes they say it does correctly.  In any event you're better off just buying a monitor that rotates on the stand it comes with unless you have like a 17" or 19" square monitor from the 90's.
5,it is heavy but works.
5,Attractive. Instructions easy to understand. High quality materials. Very easy to assemble.
5,Even better than I imagined. Stand is sturdy and well built
5,Sturdy and reliable.
5,Works great with a used Samsung monitor with a broken stand.
1,Did not nearly fit in portrait mode which was the sole reason I purchased it.
5,Works well and feels very sturdy
5,Product is sturdy and does not take up much space.
5,Worked as expected.
5,Very nice.  Better than I expected
5,gets the job done great quality good maneuverability
5,Best monitor stand so far super good quality seems sturdy and durable really happy with everything
2,After about a month or so the single rivet used to hold the angle decided it was done.  I've now got a stack of stuff on one side of the monitor just to hold it straight.Honestly aside from that it works great.  Supports my ASUS 21:9 with no worries about it tipping or anything so aside from that rivet it's quite sturdy.
5,Works perfectly for my small TV
5,Very sturdy and easy to assemle.
2,It's just too bulky. Takes up too much space. Would be better for a tv rather than a computer monitor. Very inconvenient when you have two monitors and not a huge desk.
5,Adjustments galore. Used it or a monitor display for my laptop.
5,It has worked well for me--I love the sturdiness and the swivel feature.
5,Just awesome. Looks good works good no issues good buy. Thanks.
2,The screws that attach the stand to the base were pre drilled and very far from straight. Now the screen will never sit perfectly on the base.
5,Very sturdy very secure.
5,Looks great and fits my monitor really well
5,Works as intended
5,Pretty good 👍
1,DO NOT buy this stand if you plan on trying to rotate a larger monitor into portrait mode.  It will NOT work.  I purchased this specifically to rotate a 32-inch monitor and there is not enough vertical height in the stand even at the highest notch to make this possible.  The base of the stand gets in the way and there is no clearance for the monitor to rotate.  Waste of money.
5,Works great.
5,great stand at any price.
5,Nice and sturdy.
5,Far less expensive than other brands great quality and durability
5,Very sturdy.
5,Works great!
1,I purchased two of these to have dual monitors that are the same size and brand to sit next to each other. One of the monitor arms I received was slightly taller than the other so it is impossible to get the two screens to be lined up properly. The vertical adjustment on these stands are set slots within the pole that you to remove the monitor and mount and place in the notches depending on your desired height. The screens do not sit straight or adjust easily. It is very shaky and terribly difficult to get it to sit straight.
1,The stand is too short to fit a 32" monitor in portrait mode.
5,This is a good product.
5,Worked fantastic easy to follow instructions
5,Great quality
1,Claims to support 77 pounds and to allow rotation (e.g. horizontal to vertical) for monitors up to 32 inches. My 32 inch 13.9 pound monitor was to large to allow full rotation. Also the rotation mechanism was non adjustable and too flimsy---monitor would not stay in  horizonal position - always crooked.
5,Recommended stands for monitors of its size
5,Awesome stand.
5,Awesome
5,Good product and description.
5,really good
5,Great stand
5,Awesome and durable!
5,Great quality
2,was said to have been used but all parts intact was not multiple parts missing not happy at all.
1,The stand is fine but this one was sold with deep scratches on the vertical mount and on the glass base.  It seems obvious that the item was a damaged return sold as new. If you want to buy damaged goods sold as new this stand is perfect.
5,Solid.
1,The description was a bit deceiving for the eight dimensions so it was sent back. With that I am not able to attest to how study the stand is but it did look like it was well made and will definitely work with the average sized monitors.
2,Stand was very difficult to keep level moved at the slightest touch.  Plastic accents on the stand looked and felt cheap poor quality. Returned and purchased a quality monitor arm instead.
5,Works great
5,Nice product
1,Poor quality control.  The holes weren't tapped in the stand where it meets the glass base.  No way to assemble.  Waste of time and resources but hey at least the factory made their bonus for getting these out so quickly -eyeroll-
1,It is quite heavy and now without one of its pads I can't use since it's not leveled.
1,For this product to work the rubber feet need to be firmly in place. However if you attempt to slide the stand and monitor as a unit the feet come off of the glass plate that is the pedestal. I guess it would work if you never clean your desktop.
5,Works great
5,Perfect
1,This stand is pretty flimsy and unstable for anything other than 20 something inch lightweight monitors. My 32" monitor tipped forward and cracked so because of this piece of trash I broke a monitor. The height adjustment is also terrible and requires you to remove the bracket from the stand.
1,Swivel very loose and the glass base is warped - so it's very wobbly on my flat desk. It still works but just with headaches...I don't think this product should be 4+ stars at this moment in timeMaybe a 3 is kind.My particular one is certainly a 1 and likely defective.
1,My monitor was well under the supported weight load of this stand and I installed it correctly. Regardless the monitor fell from the stand and crashed screen first into my keyboard and desk. The screen is now completely destroyed. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you really hate your monitor for some reason.
2,It can not support the weight of my 27" monitor it keeps sagging and there is no way to fix it without taking them to a machinist.
1,I ordered two of these and one came used and broken even was half armed (the base).It has scratches all over the base glass and in the stand metal stick. There was a piece that came broken. One star and because I have to put something! EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED!!
1,First review I've ever written title of the product lists this as fitting monitors up to 32". Tried my 29" monitor and it does not fit. Too good to be true at this price point. Very disappointed. Do not recommend for anyone attempting to use their monitor vertically.
2,Rotating mechanism failed. Monitor will not stay in a vertical position
1,I couldn't even assemble this product because the threaded holes in the base do not match the supplied bolts.As you can see from the photo they barely connect before stopping completely. I am being sent a replacement but I'm disgusted by the atrocious lack of quality.
2,Does not handle half of the weight advertised is a tip over risk
1,Doesn't work for 32 inch in portrait. Waste of money
2,Peace of crap. Won’t stay level no matter what I do.
1,Stand itself is sturdy enough however the actual VESA mount isn't at all. The monitor will tilt and pivot at the slightest touch. Not to mention that the overall quality of the product leaves much to be desired.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The screws provided are too long. Even the shortest screw doesn’t fit. And the number of washers provided are not enough. We had to manually add paper board to stabilize it.(Yes we don’t wanna take the time to search for another one yet we have time write this review: too lazy)
1,This comes in like 100 different parts that you have to assemble.  Not sure how a monitor stand can be some complicated.  Would never buy again.
1,In vertical position monitor doesn’t stay in position.
5,Works nice with my 27” scepter monitor
1,Doesn’t fit to 32 inch
1,Terrible directions are just terrible do not buy
1,It’s not what I wanted
5,Easy to assemble! Very sturdy & stable! The 360 swivel is pretty awesome! Thank you!
5,Just to get this out of the way first the directions are worse than IKEA if you aren’t mechanically inclined like me. As for the stand itself it is just about perfect. The base is heavy black glass ( mine has a deep scratch along the edge prior to packaging) and the “tower” is very sturdy. As you can see by the photos from others  you can raise or lower your monitor or TV to your preference but take care  - it’s better to have help if you have small hands.  I prefer this style to hanging my monitor on the wall so I can move it out of my way when doing artwork. The only downside for me personally is the size of the base. 1 inch smaller around would have suited me better. Five stars for the design and quality.
5,I bought this to replace my MSI Optix MAG322CR 32" Curved monitor stand.  It was Very quick and easy to assemble and I really like it.Just a couple of observations though.  1) Although it would probably need a re-design of the Vesa mount assembly I think some indents would be nice so if you DID want to swivel the monitor side to side or rotate it 360 degrees you would have to move it out of a home indent to do so.  And returning it to stock position would be a Lot easier.  2)  Got this on February 6'th and probably my fault the plastic wing nut that you turn to hold the monitor in place when adjusting the tilt of the display broke off.  Was able to tighten it with a socket wrench.  May just find a longer bolt that would go thru the top two holed & a metal Wing Nut to repair it.  Just thought you would like to know.Will still recommend this stand to  my friends with the warning don't be heavy handed with the adjustment bolt. 😸Also some people have said you have to remove the monitor from the VESA mount to raise/lower it.  I just unscrew the holding screw a few turns then grasp my monitor by the sides lift up & out then move it to a new set of slots and push in & down.This feature does make it easier if you move the move the monitor to a different location.  You can remove the monitor with the VESA mounting unit attached and move both parts separately so there's no chance of breaking ether monitor or stand (Unless you're a butterfingers like me!).
5,Very well made with detailed instructions. I can tell even before installation that it'll work just great. Very satisfied with this!
5,I was impressed by this product while it was still in the box - very neatly and well packaged and pretty good assembly instructions. Both on the website and the instructions the seller/manufacturer seems genuinely sincere about wanting to have happy customers.In general the product does just what I was expecting. It is the proper size for my new 24" TV; other stands were too big and over-kill for this size.A couple pleasant surprises:1. There was no indication of which side of the base was up or down. Then I realized that one side has a shiny finish and the other side a matte finish. So you can decide which side you want to be visible.2. There was a bag full of bolts and adapters to try to fit to as many TVs or monitors as possible. I found the ones I needed with no problem.The disappointment: One other reviewer noted that one of the two treads connecting the upright to the stand was poorly machined. The provided bolt would not (easily) screw in. I was concerned that if I forced it too hard I could end up stripping the threads. Fortunately I have a tap and die set and was able to ream out the threads and get the bolt to properly seat. I'm guessing that not many purchasers would be able to do that.
1,Only one of the hole that the screw can go in. Bad quality.
5,Nice design...Worked as expected
5,Very sturdy well built with no noticible monitor wobble. Bought this to replace the horrible stand that comes with the Alienware 240 hz monitor in which that stands legs stick out too far. Real easy and fast to put together. Cheap too.
5,I've had it for over a month and it has worked put GREAT! I love it! You will not be disappointed :)
3,It does the job as monitor stand. I'm using it with a cheap Sceptre 24 inch monitor which screwed on fine.PROS:-Easy enough to assemble-Build quality is really nice and it is sturdy.-Securely holds onto monitor.Cons:-The glass base attracts fingerprints like no tomorrow.-24 inch monitors and up will NOT be able to go fully verticle because it hits the base of the stand.-Kinda annoying to adjust height. Because of the way it uses hooks and rivets to adjust the height that means you 'll have to move the entire monitor to lower or raise it. If you plan to leave it as is at a comfortable height that's fine but it doesn't have like the slide/stop adjustments on some other monitors.
3,This is a solid and easy to assemble VESA stand. I'm using it for my 27" iMac. I'd rate it higher except for one feature (or lack there of). The height adjustments are incremental about 2" for each step. The perfect height for my desk is in-between steps one and two nothing major and I'll probably put the stand on a riser to get the perfect height I'm looking for but would have been nice if that could have been accomplished with the stand by itself. Ultimately if you can live with the limited height adjustments it would rank a solid 4 especially for the price.
5,Nothing. Home and work
1,
2,it come off very quick now monitors are uneven unbalanced and can't stand very well not a good quality product.
5,Setting up this monitor stand is a breeze. It took me less than 5 minutes to set the whole thing up and attached the monitor. Adjusting the height is just a matter of unscrewing just one bolt and move the monitor up or down. The bolt is about 2 inches and you have to screw it all the way in to secure the monitor from wobbling. This part is a bit annoying because every time you adjust the height you have to unscrew the bolt all the way out & screw it back all the way in at the new desired height. It is time consuming & definitely frustrating if you plan to adjust the height frequently.The swivel is about 45 degrees on both sides and it allows you to rotate the monitor easily and with little effort. The 360 degree rotation just as easy and smooth. The material used to make this stand is of good quality especially the 1/3" inch Tempered safety glass is heavy duty and durable.Price is not too bad and at the time of purchase this one was priced the lowest with lots of good customer reviews. Very happy with this purchase.
5,The glass base on this monitor stand is heavy and makes for a sturdy monitor stand.  Despite the instructions being written by someone who's not a native English speaker they were clear and easy enough to assemble the stand easily.  The vertical post doesn't have infinite vertical settings but they have enough mount points to be adjustable enough.  It includes 2 Velcro straps on the vertical post to keep those cables ordered.  I'm happy I bought this product.
4,Like that or comes with different screws and hardware or tv or monitors. I don't like that it comes standard at a downward tilt when I adjust it full up since I use it with a monitor I don't need the down tilt and when adjusted up all the way have to use the Allen key to lock it which wouldn't be too bad but that's an extra step if I want to tilt to adjust it later have to unlock it etc. Aside from the slight down angle tilt the tilt and side adjustment are good and easy though if needed to moved. Only had 5 presets for height adjustment which are decent. To be honest i will keep looking for a better stand similar to the standard Dell one.
5,Super heavy and well made easy to assemble. Looks really sleek and. I’ve looking. It swivels and rotates easily. Don’t know what else to say it’s a monitor stand. Very nice don’t regret my purchase lol
5,Sturdy well built good footprint but solid. I like things that match and I needed two. They work great and are VESA adaptable.
5,5 min setup and its really sturdy. Fits 24 inch Dell monitors perfectly.
5,Neat appearnce easy to assemble just right for my 21" computer monitor. Recommend highly.
5,Its sturdy and I like the option to move it left and right with no hassle. The stand on my monitor was gross and this is great
4,This is a high quality stand. Good structure and universal. HOWEVER I did not receive a proper base size for the neck of the stand. If you look at the pictures I attached the base is too big and the hole do not align at all. I had to drill a hole myself so they would match up. Could I get a new part from the seller?
5,Easy to assemble. Looks great love the glass base. Very sturdy and nice stand for the price.
5,Like the structural integrity very well built.
5,Really GREAT product...
5,This stand is amazing.  It is sturdy and replaced the cheap plastic one that broke.
4,Excellent product. Easy to assemble.  Just a little heavy for my mini table that's not starting to bend
5,I have a 30 inch monitor and this stand is super sturdy and is easy to put together.
5,Perfect purchase!!! Should have bought a long time ago
5,Easy to assemble very sturdy item holds my TV just perfect and I like the idea that I can tilt the screen slightly down.
5,Works perfectly with my 24” monitor.
5,I wanted a stand for my desk that didn't stick out too far since my workspace is narrow (depth of desk.) This fit well vs. others I've tried that have a bigger mounting attachment causing the monitor to extend out too far. The base is also functional to place a keyboard on since it's a rectangular surface. Happy with the product and price!
5,This is an incredibly sleek sturdy base that made my whole desk space (both at home and at work) feel bigger and look better. My husband bought one for his monitor after upgrading to a large curved screen and it looked fantastic. I have a 72" monitor both at home and at my office and after getting one for home I ended up getting another for the office.It is easily adjustable very steady and was incredibly easy to put together and set up. Absolutely recommend.
4,Made of some serious metal. Very solid.I seriously suggest that you get 1 -10mm wrench and 1-4mm hex wrench before assembling.Use the wrenches to pre-tension the bolts for the adjustments before attaching to you monitor. Just lightly snug them. Otherwise your monitor is going to move around way too easy. Much easier doing this before attaching the bracket to the monitor.I knocked off 1 star for the lack of the above wrenches in the parts kit. No excuse for that.The instructions aren't the greatest but should be fine for most. There wasn't anything about the need for the extra tools or the need to pretension before attaching to the monitor.I like that the base is thick heavy metal with a glass top. It only takes up about 1/3 of the space the nonadjustable original took.I am very satisfied with this mount and would definitely buy it again!
4,The first product I received the screw wouldn't screw into the stand from the base. The replacement I got works great and feels really sturdy. The height adjustment isn't automatic but in my use case that's no problem.  I mounted a 27 inch monitor vertically and I could only slot it on the topmost slot. Seems sturdy no shaking.
5,This stand works great for my 24” monitor. I thought it might cause the monitor to tip over but It does have a thick glass base which prevents that from happening. The assembly was a bit difficult but nothing that should keep you from considering this stand. The monitor does allow for tilting which helps greatly to view my monitor. Overall it was a very good purchase.
5,Compatible with our Lenovo all-in-one monitor. The base is square so it looks really for our frontdesk.
5,Really easy to use.
5,Easy to put together and holds my monitor at a good height. Perfect for what I need and I’m surprised at how well made it is.
5,It was really easy to assemble it took me maybe 5 mins. And it feels very secure. It also adds the functionality of heigh rotation and tilt that I was looking for although I do have some grievances. 1. The glass bottom is a finger print magnet. 2. I would like to see one more section so I can have the screen lower. Other than that it was exactly what I was looking for.
5,Pretty stable  adjustable and great looking. Totally worth the price. My monitor is an ultrawide curved 34”
5,Puchased this to use with a new 34" ultrawide monitor.  I didn't like the stand that came with it AND wanted something that I could adjust the height.  I have a very similar (nearly identical) version of this stand that I use on a 32" tv.  Very sturdy looks good (imho) and easy to assemble.And while it is height adjustable you have to choose between 4 settings.  To change it you have to lift the monitor (or TV) off of the stand and then move it to another notch on the stand.  So it's really more that you can pick the height that you like and then leave it there.
5,I love this product. great quality and does the job. Fits perfect on my L Shape desk with Hutch . I've been searching for base stand and didn't take long to find this one. For the price I recommend and I'm broke like a joke.
5,I wanted a stand that put the monitor as close to the table as possible and this works perfect for this 32" monitor.
5,I wanted a vertical monitor to read PDFs and documents but there was nothing wrong with my old monitor. I found this monitor stand. It is easy to install; took me about 20 minutes. Love the swivel and rotation features and now I upcycled my old monitor into a vertical monitor! Love it!
5,Super surprised when I got it. Base is a very heavy metal base whole thing is metal no plastic to break. Ease of setup was extremely easy enjoying it already. Will be getting 2 more just so all my monitors have the same base. Thanks to the seller!!
5,Awesome stand. I happened to have thrown away my stand for my monitor (since I was using arm mounts). I was giving one of my monitors to my little sister but I no longer had the mount. Ordered this mount and it was perfect. Very very sturdy can be adjusted and even has small clips in the back to route your cables down the mount.
5,Looks awesome and super sturdy. Easy to assemble.
5,Like many others said would be great if the stand had a slider for height adjustment but considering I don't shift it up and down much I am pretty happy with the overall quality of the stand. Would say it's better than the original monitor stands that came with my monitors. Love how heavy substantially weighted the glass bottom is.  Gives it a quality look.
5,Now that I'm permanently working from home I purchased a used Apple Thunderbolt display to supplement my MacBook laptop screen. The Apple display was heavy compared to my old HP monitor - 25 lbs vs 8 lbs! I was looking for a monitor stand that was sturdy enough to hold the display.So far this is a great purchase that I recommend making if you're looking for a stand to mount your screen/monitor.The Pros: It was simple to assemble and included several mounting options depending on the type of screen/monitor you are attaching to the stand. Despite the Thunderbold being an older/discontinued display type this stand included compatible mounting options. The stand is also sturdy enough to hold up the heavy display. The stand gives several mounting options and allows you to swivel the stand left/right and up/down. The stand is also quite small so it doesn't take up too much desk space.The Cons: None so far! I am curious if over time the stand will start to droop due to weight or if constantly adjusting the screen will loosen the joints. If I see that happen I will update my review.
5,I needed a new Monitor stand to replace the one I had that clamped to the desk after receiving a new Corsair RGB desk pad. We have a TV stand that is very similar to this one and LOVE it so we ordered a monitor stand that matched. SUPER easy to build and mount the monitor. Incredibly sturdy for my 27-inch monitor and I really like the look and clean lines of the tempered glass base.  It's quick and easy to adjust... the VESA mounting plate slides into slots on the vertical bar with one easy to remove locking screw to make sure it stays in place (just like on the TV stand).  If there was a con for this it would once again be Amazon's wonky shipping. When I ordered the stand the advertised delivery date was the next day. When I checked the shipping the next day they had changed it to being delivered by 10 PM on the following day. I took a moment to go back and check to make sure that I was not misremembering the advertised ship date- nope! In fact it now said If I ordered in the next 5 hours or so it would get there THAT DAY.  I canceled the original order and re-ordered with the current day delivery and it literally got here within hours. Delivery guy was awesome too!  Looks like the issue may have been the web page presenting an inaccurate ship date/time but this isn't the first time I've had Amazon promise one thing and deliver another with respect to product arrival dates. I will likely just start canceling the order when they try the bait and switch shipping going forward.
5,I bought this stand because the stock stand I got from my monoprice monitor was crap. The assembly was quick and easy and the manual is pretty easy to understand.It is able to tilt rotate and swivel easily and lock in and not move an inch unless you want it to. The height adjustability is ok you would have to lay it flat to make it easier to change the height but if you like to live dangerously then you can just unscrew the back and adjust it.I kind of only wanted to buy this mainly to have the monitor lower than the stock stand it is lower but not as much as I though it would be.Still I don't regret this because now I can use this stand on any monitors I may have to buy when I need to replace my current and not worry about the stand as you can use this if it is 75x75 or 100x100 vesa mount compatible.
5,The stand looks great. It has a glass surface for the platform. It's been holding my 27" monitor with no issues whatsover. It even has velcro to organize your wires even more. Overall it's great just make sure your desk can handle the extra weight. This thing is pretty damn heavy.
5,Needed a stand and this is universal. My son can't tell the difference and it's all we needed.
5,I recently discovered I DESPARATELY needed to add a second monitor to desk setup.  I didn't want to drill any additional holes in my walls (my first monitor is a wall-mounted 24-inch) so opted for a desktop stand.  I chose the square base model since it allowed me to use the space to store office odds-and-ends on top.  The stand itself is super sturdy (holding my second 24-inch monitor in portrait mode) looks quite stylish and literally took 10 mins to assemble.  I've very satisfied with the final product and highly recommend it.
5,Sturdy easy to assemble however didn’t work for my computer monitor had to send back
5,Simpler to assemble and put together. Very well made keeps my 20inch monitor stable no issues. pretty good overall buy would recommend <3also have very good day :)
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT
5,I had an existing monitor but the stand needed to be replaced. This worked great.
5,I really liked the look of it. It  have perfectly paired with my 27" monitor. Great item so glad I got it.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Very stable for a 32in monitor. Basically no wobbles at all. Took about 20minutes to assemble. However if you need to adjust the height of the monitor frequently look for something else.
5,I wanted to use this for a third monitor rotated 90-degrees in portrait and it could not be more perfect for that. The bottom swivels so you can get a better prospective from the side of your main monitor.
5,was a good monitor stand for what it was. you get exactly what is pictured. I didn't end up keeping it for long because I sold my monitor to get a different one but it served its purpose.
4,Somebody said in the reviews that this works perfectly for stacking a laptop under a monitor -- don't rely on that. He must have two small displays. I have a normal 15" laptop and a 27-inch monitor and let me tell you it did not work at all. It was like 4 or 5 inches off.This same company makes the dual stand monitor HT05B-002 which actually WILL work with mounting only one (of the two) brackets monitor on the top while letting the laptop sit on the base without running out of room. You can also put a 27" iMac on the base of it to stack two monitors. I have uploaded pictures in that review displaying out it is done.But again I repeat to save hassle for you and the seller do not buy this for any type of stacking unless all your screens run awfully small. This product is not even designed for that. Buy their dual monitor stand version it's way better for this and you won't run out of room.Now other than the fact this absolutely did not work for my setup it's a great product if all you are trying to do is mount up or rise a monitor a decent amount but you don't want to sit another screen under it. This company makes particularly high-quality sturdy products. I just bought a second order of their dual monitor version for my work laptop and monitor so my workspace has four screens side by side.
5,When I switched to a standing desk the monitor stand I had no longer worked. I bought this to give me more options on height and tilt and it delivered beautifully. The other reviewers are right -- you can't easily adjust height so if that's your goal this isn't for you. But if you want a sturdy stand that gives you a good range of options and is easy to assemble this is a great choice.
5,Fits perfectly thank you so much!!!
5,Not much to say. Read the description of the item and it does what it says it'll do.
5,Nice stand easy to use. Holds my 32" tv great.
5,Love the base on these puppies 1/4 in. steel plate.  These are solid. no worry about wabble or failure.  I will order from this manufacturer again.
5,Sturdyquality materials attractive appearance. Very easy to assemble It works perfectly with my 31.5” LG monitor. I like that’s it’s  fully adjustable in height swivel & screen rotation. I purchased the pictured curved wooden riser with it. The glass monitor base fits perfectly for a clean look. My nvidea shield is tucked away in the riser. I’m very satisfied with this stand and I recommend it.
5,Easy to assemble and very sturdy. Perfect height for what I needed.
1,It looks and feels well made it comes with extra screws to give you options for your screen/ monitor and once it's all assembled it feels sturdy; with all the screws and bolts secured and tight once you mount the monitor it won't move or tilt or shake the swivel is soft and it stays where you stop not shaking or returning.And it is relatively easy to assemble.But it does not work with a 32" monitor as advertised in text and drawings. It's too short to allow height adjusting and you cannot flip your monitor vertically that is the reason why I got this desktop stand as opposed to other similar.I have to process a return which I don't think is fair because I feel duped. It is not my problem if who designed this does not know how to properly develop product and whether they have a 32" monitor to test or not in their factory is also not my problem. Explaining it works with a 32" screen without clarifying you can only mount it HORIZONTALLY is hiding information and I am not ok with having to return a piece that's heavy and fragile at the same time and wait until it's received to process my refund I am not returning it because I don't like it or it broke I am returning it because it is not properly described and it was a total waste of money and time.
5,Easy to assemble and comes with extra screws to attach to any screen type. Stand is sleek looking with mirror black glass finish on base and having a swivel-tilt for my monitor is icing on the cake!
5,The wall mount from Walmart is great if you have a stud that works with you. However this stand works on my desk vertical monitor(21") and the tilt is amazing. This stand has so much flexibility with swivel tilt and rotation.
5,Super sturdy. They're not small so if you're dealing with a tight space that's a consideration. They're also pretty tall for a medium sized (24") monitor the lowest rung is taller than the factory stand that came with the monitor. I would like more slots lower on the post.Overall though really solid. No bounce and the pivoting hardware is easy to adjust and stays put.
5,The directions were somewhat lacking but if you need instructions to make effective use of the provided screws washers spacers and hex wrench then I'm skeptical you'll have much luck operating whatever your monitor/TV is being connected to either.Adjustments are adequate and stay where I put them. Rotating left/right and swiveling left/right stay in place by friction i.e. no set screws to hassle with. The tilt up/down is set with a knob and it stays put nicely. There's a set screw to keep the bracket attached to wherever it's positioned on the stand as well. The provided rubber feet keep the base from sliding around and the whole assembly is surprisingly solid. It looks sharp too which is only relevant when the system is off as the rest of the time the monitor displays a rotating selection of anime cheesecake. ;}Can't speak to its claimed maximum size/weight specs but it handles my 12# 22" widescreen LCD monitor like it was made for it.
4,Just be sure to tighten correctly into place
5,works great
5,It was a snap to assemble! I wanted something that I could set and still move  the screen. I look at the screen from 3 different places AND heights. ( all in the same room) This covers ALL my needs. Very happy to have it.
5,I like the flat base that this stand has. I can reclaim desk space with this stand.
5,TL;DR: rock solid limited height adjustment need some other tools.I use this stand to hold a very heavy 27” LG gaming monitor that I bought without the original stand. It is VERY sturdy and much better than pretty much any stock stand. Cable management on the back is a huge bonus. Feet are high enough to fit a keyboard cable under but a little too much drag for a mouse cable. Mine stays in one height position but if you find yourself needing to adjust this a lot I wouldn’t recommend. Instead of having a shoulder the thumb screw that you have to remove to move the monitor up and down on the slots is threaded all the way up the bolt. The threaded insert is all the way at the BACK of the stand which means you have to thread the entire ~1.5 inch bolt with your fingers behind the monitor. Fine if you don’t plan on adjusting height frequently would not advise if you want to move it a lot. Also the height adjustment is on set slots that are over 1” apart fine enough for me but some could have a problem with this.For assembly it came with a few tools but not quite enough - I found myself needing another hex wrench (somewhere from 3-5mm can’t remember) and some open ended wrenches (again metric) to tighten some of the tilt adjustment screws.Looks very nice and more expensive than it actually is.
5,This is a very good stand for my 27" monitor. Took me maybe 15 minutes to put together. The instructions are not as thorough as I would have liked but I figured it out. The base is metal with a glass top and the "spine" seems very sturdy. The "connection" between the monitor and the "spine" didn't seem very good at first glance but once set looks solid. That I can adjust the monitor height and swivel are both pluses.
4,Holds my wifes monitor higher to help save her back.
5,Setting up the monitor stand wasn't too hard with the help of picture instructions. Comes with different types of screws. I'm using this to mount my 27 inch ASUS monitor and it holds it up like nothing. I like the included cable management clips and the solid strong base
5,Ease of assembly stable and compact.
5,Solid product. Came with lots of screws so a wide variety of monitors can be mounted on it.
1,Way under 77 pounds and it always tilts.Horrible product for heavy monitors
5,I went from a monitor arm to this stand when I added a second monitor to my setup. I tried a dual monitor arm and couldn't get the results I wanted. This stand was perfect. The base has a small footprint and it adjusts smoothly but stays where it needs to once it's adjusted. It has good stability my monitor doesn't constantly shake when I use my PC.This was very easy to set up I had it assembled in under 10 minutes.The glass base is very thick and looks and feels to be very durable (for tempered glass) but it will definitely be a dust magnet.The only "con" is the "prong system" for horizontal adjustment. You get 4 positions and that's it. They're good positions I found a perfect one immediately but this is not for some that wants that minut control over the horizontal adjustment.Otherwise this is a excellent product for $20 if you want a nice looking adjustable stand with a solid base with a small footprint on your desk.(The monitor to the left in the picture is the one with the stand. I plan to buy this product again for my main monitor to lessen the footprint on my desk and make it more uniformed)
5,easy to put together. fit my monitor perfectly.
5,I ordered this adjustable stand for a 27" monitor and I am very impressed with the quality. It is almost overbuilt. Sturdy easy to assemble very stable and nicely finished. The thick black glass base looks great under my Samsung monitor.
5,The product quality is great. The stand is sturdy made and the options for height are great. It's easy to assemble....if you can follow directions.The base is made of glass with one side glossy and the other side not. If you prefer a look closer to matte.....I used that side.The hooks for the cords are wide enough for several cables. I only had 2.....and used black zip ties for a neater look.Very pleased with this purchase....
5,Very heavy solid & strong stand - very satisfied - holds my MSI Optix G273 (27") monitor no problem.Love the low-profile base; takes up minimal desktop space.
5,Does everything advertised. If you want a good mourn without breaking the bank then this is the one! Hell I don’t leave reviews so I know I must like it!
5,The base to a monitor I handed down to my son broke and this was a perfect replacement highly recommended 👌
5,Easy to assemble extremely sturdy. Perfect for my 27” gaming monitor.
5,I love this thing!!!! SOOOOO easy to put together the instructions were very clear. It looks really sleek on my desk and the glass plating adds a really nice vibe to it too. It is super easy to adjust it and to make it higher or lower is a little bit more work but nothing that takes more than 60 seconds. Great product that I will be recommending to friends and going to purchase another for my other monitor.
2,Easy to set up. The base looks so nice I like it. But it looks like a TV stand not a computer monitor stand
5,I searched high and low for a monitor stand to replace the base that came with my Samsung 32 inch monitor. I was a bit hesitant to purchase due to some negative reviews but I knew straight away I would mainly use it at a fixed height; not constantly adjusting position.Item arrived exactly as described and was easy to set up. The stand is super study and looks great against my black glass desk. As others have pointed out it is not easy to adjust as you'll need to either hold your monitor or remove it to adjust height setting. Overall still a great buy due to functionality and price point - very pleased with purchase - I do recommend.
5,Works great.
5,Sturdy easy to assemble and looks great
5,Me permitio complementar mi estación de trabajo
5,Very pleased with the purchase does what it's intended to do I would buy again and highly recommend 🤙😊
5,Purchased just to raise the monitor a few inches off the desk but I gotta say I'm impressed how quickly and easy it was to set up.
5,I was looking at monitor risers originally and decided to replace the entire stand instead. I had no idea I would be getting something this good looking and stable compared to my original stand. All I wanted to do was be able to adjust my monitor. Very very impressed.
5,The adjustable stand is perfect for my son's desk. It was easy to assemble and he loves the glass base.
5,I've honestly spent hours searching for a stand to replace the Samsung Odyssey G5 34" Ultrawide stand and found it. The stand that came with the Odyssey is absolute garbage it is rigid plastic that forces the screen to face downward with no ability to adjust/tilt/swivel. It was extremely frustrating. I purchased other stands (ARM standard monitor stands with a weight capacity of 17.6 lbs that offered only one of the options this stand does swivels doesn't tilt tilts doesn't move up or down) none of them worked well with my monitor and desk set up.Pros you can tilt your monitor up or down turn your monitor clockwise or counter clockwise swivel and adjust your stand every way you can imagine. I did not go vertical due to the screen size but wouldn't need to anyway. It's sturdy looks great and does not take up a lot of space.I opted for the version of this stand that supports 13-32inch screens since I did not want something bigger and it works perfectly. It comes with all the screws and spacers you will need to mount this. I didn't care to much for the velcro wire organizers (it would have been an improvement if they were plastic but is is a nice touch to have) If you are looking for a stand to replace the horrendous one that comes with the G5 this works.
5,You just follow the paper instructions and injoy.
5,idée pour espace restrint
1,This thing is mostly crap quality and definitely does not deserve the almost-five-star rating it has. The connector piece between the metal column and the glass base is cheap plastic that is prone to scratches making what would otherwise be a nice aesthetic look cheap and run down. Adjusting the monitor height or rotating it is very awkward. The English writing in the manual is atrocious. Most egregiously they sent me missing parts; a bunch of screws were missing. It came all the way from China so I didn't bother to return it and just threw it out.
5,Using this stand to hold an old school and heavy 24" monitor.  Nice and sturdy with heavy base.  Height adjustment isn't a slide but is fixed and easy to adjust by removing a hand screw. Velcro straps for cable management may not be to everyone's taste but can always be removed if required.
1,The stand on my NEC LCD3090WQXi disintegrated so I bought this to replace it. The monitor weighs 47lbs and it is very unstable on this stand: it tips forward at the slightest provocation. The claim that it would support 70lbs is nonsense.Also the tilt adjustment cannot bear the weight without the monitor sagging forward.
5,Super easy to put together and my heavy monitor is well supported.
5,Wow rapport qualité prix imbattable
5,Good
4,See image. Monitor on the right is an HP 24''. The bottom sits close to the base of the stand but if I want I can put a bit higher but that's about it. I reckon the largest monitor you can mount in portrait mode is 27''. For me this stand does the job and it's pretty sturdy.
5,excellent produit
5,Seulement la fixation ne correspond pas aux trous derriere mon écran mais cette partie est mon erreur de ne pas avoir vérifié avant de commander.
5,So far so good seems to hold my curved 27” monitor no problem. Had to get rid of the ridiculous stand that comes with my Samsung monitor
5,We had 3 monitors in the office that were removed from wall mounts and of course the stands were long gone so needed something to mount these on for desk use and saw these listed. This product impressed me with the quality and finish easy to assemble and gives a range of mounitng heights with tilt and swivel options you can't go wrong with this stand. 10 out of 10
5,Prompt delivery easy set up
5,Great! Good quality and sturdy. Good value and fast delivery.
3,la base de vidrio preciosa.  trae varios tornilos pero ninguno se ajusto  a la altura  (depth del barreno)  de mi monitor . eso se soluciona comprando unos en tu tienda local  pero  el mecanismo demasiado rigido  para el tilt. lo habia leido pero  aun asi lo compre . lo voy a regresar
4,The stand is sturdy and well built. The instructions are clear and the parts are well labelled. The stand however is not tall enough to allow a 32” monitor to rotate from a landscape to portrait position. I really like the stand but I have to return it unfortunately.
5,I was surprised that it could hold the position I needed it in the spacers it came with allowed it to fit my weird monitor too! Great product would buy again.
5,Un poco caro pero vale la pena por su base de cristal
5,I bought 2 of these for my monitors they fit pretty good and I was able to assemble them with minimul difficulty. I've been using it for 2 months now and I've had no issues at all really recommend it. I do feel like one of my heavier monitor eventually tilts forward by a couple of cm or so but it's no big issue I can always fix the angle
5,No tengo queja el producto llegó en perfecto estado cumple su función no es tan alto pero fue error mío al no verificar la altura máxima armado fácil y rápido lo recomiendo ampliamente.
5,Support TV excellentRobuste
5,Excellent rapport qualité/prix
5,The packaging is great with clear English instructions and various parts labelled clearly. The stand holds my 32 inch TV securely. Able to tilt the TV left and right rotate it as per stated in the product information. Great quality.
5,So easy to install and very stable.
3,I really liked the look of it. It would have perfectly paired with my 27" monitor but unfortunately it was shipped without the mounting Vesa plate and had to be returned. The plate wasn't available separately so I didn't have a choice. It was Amazon Wearhouse deal with an 'INSPECTED' sticker on it missing an important part???
5,This is a fantastic stand. Very sturdy and very affordable. Was able to hold my 32” monitor with no problem. Easy to assemble. Only think i did not realize was that adjusting the height is a bit of a pain. Need to unscrew the backside loft the monitor slot it to the appropriate level then screw it back again.  Aside from that this is great.Reason i bought this because the original monitor stand is too bulky and was taking up too much space. This one is just great
5,Convenient and easy to setup.
1,Unable to attach the base as the thread is not aligned. Tried a different screw with the same result. Really Poor!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Specifications for this stand states that it has 360deg rotation which allows you to use your monitor in profile orientation. This is not the case as you can see in the picture and video. The monitor mount that comes with the stand is not adequate and can not hold the weight of a 27” Samsung monitor in the desired position.
5,Unbeatable for the price I installed my 30 pounds iMac (purchase with a VESA connector at apple). Very stable. Adjustment are limited but for a 27 inch iMac screen no problem to find the optimal height. So far so good
5,The stand performed as advertised! Rotates tilts and turns. The instructions for setup were clear plenty of bolts for mounting your screen were available. Turn diameter will need to be considered if you have a large screen that you intend to rotate but my 24inch monitor works just fine. I’ve had to move it a few times between work and home with monitor attached and it’s stayed sturdy with no scratches.
5,I absolutely love the monitor stand and would highly recommend it!!!
5,Very easy to put together.  Very sturdy and secure no wobbling jiggling or tilting of any kind.Love the ability to adjust it in any direction no matter what configuration I have it in.Love that I can rotate the monitor without having to undo or loosen anything.  And that it stays how I have positioned it without it "creeping" out of adjustment.Very easy to adjust the height.Looks great.Highly recommend.  Will probably buy another to replace the stock stand on my other monitor it is that good.I honestly can't think of anything else I could ever need for a monitor stand.  Basically perfect.
2,Mounting hardware worked fine. Mount is not designed for anything bigger than a 27" lcd.
4,Easy enough to assemble and does have good range of movement as long as screen is not to big. Good value for price sturdy. Taking off one star because description is misleading. In order to adjust height you need to hold the screen and then unscrew/rescrew in new position.
2,Mounting hardware worked fine. Mount is not designed for anything bigger than a 27" lcd.
3,I brought this product March 2021 for a Acer 32" PC screen. The product was easy to install and found it generally a good stand. However the description of the product is mis-leading for a 32" monitor. There are 4 slots to adjust the height. For a 32 inch monitor there is no way you are able to adjust the height. You are only able to mount on the top slot (i.e. 4th slot). For my monitor this was 3 inches lower than the stand which came with it. Secondly the VESA mount bracket came with multiple screw types and sizes. Unfortunately none of the screws were compatible with the ACER monitor. I had to add my own washers to make a sturdy fit which did the trick. However I was not able to compromise on the height issue. I returned my stand to Amazon.
5,El soporte es muy bueno la calidad es bastante buena
5,Very sturdy assembled and attached to my monitor in less than 5 minutes. Great design and very practical
1,Too heavy and unstable with the scratched glass stand.
5,J’avais besoin d’un pied pour un vieux téléviseur de 22 pouces qui pèse 35 livres.  Ce pied de téléviseur a été livré en 2 jours est très stable permet un ajustement en hauteur des inclinaisons. Il répond entièrement à mes besoins.
2,Cheap stand but would be functional except that the height is set by hooking the monitor in to the vertical stand and then locking that in place with a bolt threaded through a nut insert. On mine the bolt did not match any of the nut inserts so you could not lock it in place.
5,What an amazing deal! I have only used this for the large and heavy Apple XDR the Apple stand version of which is $1699!! This stand is black in colour so if you care about that select the Apple version but if you want a solid easy to assemble and highly functional stand to hold your heavy monitor this one fits the description. Assembly is simple basically you bolt the vertical column into the base stick on some base pads and you are ready. The supplied VESA mount screws right into the Apple VESA adaptor and the stand mount then hooks into the slots on the vertical column. You first lock the Apple adaptor into the monitor using the Apple supplied key then bolt in the stand bracket (use your own Phillips screwdriver the bolts have screw heads). Once hooked onto the vertical support column it is then held in place by both a long finger bolt and by its weight. It can swivel sideways (I might have to tighten this a bit- will require pliers to turn a bolt or a small socket) and via a tension bolt vertically. Of the many screws supplied to connect the VESA bracket to your TV or in this case XDR monitor you will use the smallest sized ones along with both washers as spacers. You may be able to use the longer bolts (6 different sizes are supplied) with the supplied larger spacers but I see no point in this- use the small ones in the "G" pouch. Plenty of latitude for height adjustment via the 5 slots in the vertical column in the image the XDR is on the second lowest.There is plenty of room for height adjustment with the Apple XDR. I am using it on the second lowest setting which
5,Excellent stand and exactly what we were expecting. It is sturdy and we are happy. Would recommend.
1,Terrible. One of the main screws doesn’t fit. Amazon will not send replacement parts.
5,this is way better than the original stand I had for my monitor.rubber pads on the bottom very strong and sturdy.  My 32 "monitor even rotates now!great product.
